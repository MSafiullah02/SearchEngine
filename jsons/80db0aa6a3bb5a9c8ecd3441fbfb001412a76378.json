A useful parameter that summarizes this ease of spread is the \"basic reproductive number\" always denoted as R 0 . The definition of the basic reproductive number is the number of secondary infections caused during the entire duration of one infection if all contacts are susceptible (i.e., can be infected). The concept has widespread currency in the literature on infectious disease models with varying degrees of affection [3] . There is no question that it has been a useful, simple rule of thumb for characterizing how easily an infection can spread [4] . Furthermore, the simplest of calculations relate R 0 to the degree of intervention needed to bring an infection under control and, eventually, eradicate it. The relationship between the basic reproductive number and disease control arises from the simple fact that if each infectious person causes less than one secondary case, then the number of infections must fall. If it is always true, even when there is no infection circulating, that each new case causes less than one secondary case, then the infection will die out. This simple observation leads to a straightforward calculation for the proportion of a population that must be vaccinated in order to achieve eradication, p c :",

Fig. 5 .2a shows the solutions to Eqs. 5.2-5.4 over 50 years with a 1-week timestep. Parameters are set so that an infection with a basic reproductive number of 5 and a 1-week duration of infection is spreading in a population of 100,000 individuals. The figure illustrates how this model shows damped oscillations towards a stable state. The same is true for the ODE version of this model. This model is useful for understanding the impact of vaccination. In Fig. 5 .2b, the solutions to Eqs. 5.2-5.4 are shown when vaccination at birth is introduced 10 years into the model run. With a basic reproductive number of 5, Eq. 5.1 tells us that vaccination of over 80% of newborns will lead to eradication. This is exemplified in the pink line where 90% vaccination leads to no further cases. Vaccination coverage below this threshold value reduces the numbers of cases and increases the inter-epidemic period but does not lead to eradication. Notice the very long interepidemic period at 70% vaccination. This phenomen occurs when vaccine coverage levels are close to but do not achieve the critical coverage level. Under these circumstances, it takes a very long time to accumulate enough susceptibles to trigger the first epidemic after vaccination is introduced. It may therefore appear as though eradication has been achieved even though vaccination coverage is below the critical level. This phenomenon, named \"the honeymoon period,\" [5] was first described in modeling studies and later identified in field data [6] . The ability to identify target vaccination levels predicted to lead to disease eradication has been widely influential in policy circles [7] . Models with the same fundamental structure as the SIR model are used to set targets for vaccination coverage in many settings [8] . Similar models are also used to understand the likely impact of different interventions of other sorts, for example, drug treatment [9] or measures for social distancing [10] . However, models for informing policy need to explore more of the wrinkles and complexities of the real world than are acknowledged in the simple equations of the SIR model. The next section describes some of the types of host heterogeneity that have been explored in making versions of the SIR model that aim to be better representations of the real world.",

Because vaccination acts to extend the time between epidemics (Fig. 5 .1b), it also acts to increase the average age at infection. This sets up a complex trade-off when introducing rubella vaccination to a community. On the one hand, vaccinated girls are protected from catching rubella at any age, but on the other hand, the girls who remain unvaccinated are likely to catch rubella when they are older, more likely to be in their childbearing years and so at greater risk of CRS. This means that vaccination with low coverage can actually lead to more CRS, and only when coverage levels get above a certain level do the benefits of vaccinating the community outweigh the costs.

Secondly, the per capita rate at which susceptibles become infected depends on their age and on the age of all the infected people. This model is thus able to take account of the complexities of family, school, and working life which drive people of different ages to age-dependent patterns of mixing. Thirdly, the recovery rate g(a) and, more importantly, the background death rate m(a) can both be made to depend on age.

The FMD outbreak that unfolded in the UK over the ensuing months had a huge impact with millions of farm animals killed and major economic impact in the countryside as tourism was virtually shut down.",

FMD virus is so very infectious that no attempt was made to control its spread within a farm. Once infection of livestock on a farm was detected, all susceptible animals were slaughtered. Mathematical models of the spread of this epidemic thus treat each farm as a unit of infection, and, as before, farms can be categorized as susceptible, infectious, etc. The best of these models [13] keeps track of every single farm in the United Kingdom, characterizing farms by their location and the number of sheep and cattle they hold. The model classifies farms into four groups: susceptible, incubating, infectious, or slaughtered. As in all epidemic models, the heart of the model is the per capita rate at which susceptible farms become infected -the so-called force of infection. Because this FMD model is an individual-based, stochastic simulation, it is not possible to write out its equations in a simple form as before, but the probability of infection for a single farm can easily be written.",

K is known as the \"infection kernel.\" In the FMD example, the infection kernel was estimated from contact tracing data on farms that were sources of infection and their secondary cases. This observed relationship shows a very sharp falling off of infectiousness, with a farm just 2 km distant being less than tenfold as infectious to a susceptible farm than one that is adjacent. This section describes just two of the possible heterogeneities that are often included when making models of the spread of epidemics. There is almost no end to how complex an epidemiological model can become. However, it is very easy for complex models to outstrip the data available to calculate their parameters.

In this process, new HIV variants emerge that are not recognized by the host CTLs. These variants are called \"CTL escape mutants.\" These CTL escape mutants can be seen to grow out in hosts who mount relevant CTL responses (Fig. 5. 3) and to revert in hosts who do not. The rate of reversion in hosts without relevant CTL responses reflects the underlying fitness cost of the mutation. The rate of outgrowth in hosts who do mount relevant CTL responses is a balance between the efficacy of those responses and the fitness cost of the mutations. These costs and benefits need to be examined in the context of the underlying rate of turnover of HIV-infected cells. All this can be represented in a two-line mathematical model [19] . Let x be the number of host cells infected with \"wild-type\" virus -that is, virus that can be recognized by the relevant host CTL responses. Let y be the number of host cells infected with escape mutant virus. The model then consists of a pair of ordinary differential equations describing the growth rate of each population of infected cells. The wild-type population grows at rate a, is killed by the CTL response in question at rate c, and is killed by all other processes at rate b.

This analysis shows that even though CTL responses are effective enough to drive viral evolution, they are, in quantitative terms, very weak.

The pandemics of SARS in 2003 and H1N1 swine flu in 2009 illustrated how quickly a new infectious agent spreads around the world. Neither of these was as devastating as some predicted, but the continuing pandemic of HIV is ample proof that emerging infectious diseases can have devastating consequences for human communities. Many novel emerging infections arise as zoonoses -that is, infections that cross from animals into humans [22] . To become a successful emerging infection of humans -that is, one that spreads widely amongst people -is a multi-step process [23] . First, the pathogen must cross the species barrier into people, then it must transmit between people, and finally, it must transmit efficiently enough that epidemics arise. This latter step amounts to having a basic reproductive number, R 0 , that is greater than 1. The emerging infections mentioned already, SARS, swine flu, and HIV, have transited all these steps. But there are other zoonoses that transmit to humans without emerging as epidemics or pandemics. For example, simian foamy virus, a retrovirus that is endemic in most old-world primates [24] , can be detected in people who work with primates [25] or hunt them [26] . There is no record of any human-to-human transmission, implying that this zoonosis only completes the first step in becoming an emerging infection. Other infections, whilst spreading from person to person, still do not cause epidemics because that spread is insufficiently efficient. An example of such an infection is the newly discovered arenavirus from Southern Africa called \"Lujo virus\" [27] . This virus caused a small outbreak in the autumn of 2008. Very dramatically, four out of the five known cases died, but with five cases and just four transmission events, the basic reproductive number stayed below one, and there was no epidemic.",

They developed a multi-type branching process model of the transmission and evolution of a zoonosis. They found that the probability of emergence depends very strongly on the basic reproductive number of the pathogen as it crosses into humans. This is because, even when R 0 < 1, short chains of transmission are still possible (as exemplified with Lujo virus described above).

Kubiak and colleagues explored the emergence of a novel infection in populations split into several communities, with commuters acting to join those communities together. They found that most communities are sufficiently interconnected to show no effect of spatial distribution on the emergence process, even a small number of commuters being sufficient to successfully transmit any novel pathogen between settlements.

It was only recognized as a new human infection in the 1980s when cases of immunodeficiency in young Americans were unusual enough to warrant investigation [32] . As discussed above, during the course of a single infection, HIV is able to adapt to escape from the selection pressures imposed by its host's immune response. HIV variants that cannot be recognized by current host CTLs are termed \"CTL escape mutants.\" These mutants yield important information about the strength of the immune responses that they evade. However, since they were shown to transmit from one host to another, their status has been raised to potential drivers of evolutionary change across the global HIV pandemic [33, 34] .",

For CTL responses, it is the host class 1 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type that determines which epitopes are recognized. When CTL escape mutants are transmitted into a host who does not make immune response to that epitope, the mutations are no longer advantageous, and the virus can revert to the wild type [35] . Global change in the prevalence of CTL escape mutants is therefore driven by three parallel processes: the selection of escape mutants in some hosts, transmission between hosts, and reversion of escape mutants in other hosts. Once again, this is a process that takes place across multiple levels of organization, evolution and reversion of escape mutations within infected hosts, and transmission between hosts.",

The model is a version of the so-called SI model which is a simplified version of the SIR model presented above which does not allow recovery. The model allows heterogeneity in hosts and in the infecting virus so that there are hosts who do and do not mount immune responses to a given epitope and there are viruses that do and do not have escape mutations in that epitope. This model is represented in Fig. 5.4 . As in the SIR model described in section \"The SIR Model,\" the rate at which susceptibles become infected is determined by the number of infectious people present. However, in this model, because it represents the spread of a sexually transmitted disease, it is the proportion of hosts who are infectious that drives new infections. Furthermore, there are now two virus types circulating -wild type and escape mutant. Within-host adaptation allows hosts who do mount immune responses to the epitope to drive the evolution of escape mutants, and conversely, hosts who do not mount such responses can drive the reversion of escape mutant viruses back to the wild type.",

Figure 5 .5a shows total cases through time. The total epidemic goes through three phases: an initial exponential growth, a saturation phase, and then settling to a long-term equilibrium. Figure 5 .5b shows the proportion of all cases that are escape mutants through time. Not surprisingly, faster escape rates and slower reversion rates lead to higher prevalence of escape mutants. Less intuitive are the following characteristics of Fig. 5 .5b. Whilst the epidemic is in its exponential growth phase, so long as [36] . Hosts are divided into two types: immune responders (superscript IR) and nonimmune responders (superscript NIR). There are also two variants of virus, wild type (subscript WT) and escape mutant (subscript E). Hosts are either susceptible, S, or infectious, I, and the type of virus with which they are infected is denoted by the subscript. Rates of infection are determined by the number of people infectious with each virus type. Immune responding hosts infected with the wild-type virus drive immune escape at per capita rate f, whilst nonimmune responding hosts infected with escape mutant virus drive reversion at per capita rate c. All hosts are prone to per capita death rate m, and infected hosts have an additional death rate a reversion rates are reasonably fast (say once in 10 years or faster), the prevalence of escape is expected to stabilize quite quickly. However, this is not a long-term equilibrium, and as the total epidemic turns over, the escape prevalence shifts again. For an epitope that escapes fast but reverts at an intermediate rate, this leads to a substantial drop in the prevalence of escape. Secondly, fixation of escape variants only occurs if they never revert, and even then fixation takes a very long time -much longer than it takes for the underlying epidemic to equilibrate. Thirdly, the predicted dynamics and equilibrium are very sensitive to the reversion rate (a) shows total numbers of susceptible (blue) and infectious (red) people through time. (b) shows the proportion of infections that are with escape mutant virus for a range of escape and reversion rates. The mean times to escape and reversion for each curve are as follows: red -escape 1 month, reversion never; brown -escape 5 years, reversion never; yellow -escape 5 years, reversion 50 years; pink -escape 1 year, reversion 10 years; green -escape 5 years, reversion 10 years; mauve -escape 1 year, reversion 1 year when that is slow. Notice the big difference, in the long term, between no reversion (brown line) and average time to reversion of 50 years (yellow line).",

This exercise reveals a surprisingly slow average rate of escape. Across 26 different epitopes, the median time to escape was over 8 years. There is close agreement between rates of escape inferred using this model and those estimated from a longitudinal cohort study. These slow rates are in marked contrast to the general impression given by a large number of case reports in which escape is described as occurring during the first year of infection. However, a collection of case reports is a poor basis upon which to estimate an average rate of escape.",

Chief amongst these is a growing population, and second is increasing population density as more and more people live in towns and cities. What can infectious disease modeling do to help? Models can help in two different ways. The first is to assist the understanding of systems that are intrinsically complicated. Many different interacting populations, events that occur on multiple timescales, and systems with multiple levels of organization can all be better understood when appropriate models are used as an organizing principle and a tool for formal analysis. Sometimes, the problem is that there is not enough data. A systematic description can be very revealing in searching for which new data are most needed. There are also situations where the problem is a deluge of data. In these circumstances, wellconstructed models provide a useful organizing scheme with which to interrogate those data.",

This gives the following model parameters: B = 38 per week, m = 0.00385 per person per week, g = 1 per person per week, and b = 0.00005 per infected per susceptible per week. (a) shows damped oscillations in all three classes after an initial perturbation of 20% of the susceptible class into the recovered class.In (b), vaccination of 50%, 70%, or 90% of newborns is introduced at time 10 years.
