In principle, it is straightforward to estimate this quantity from individual follow-up data that provides times from onset to death or recovery. In particular, in a competing risks context, the case fatality ratio is defined by the limiting value of the sub-distribution function, F 1 (t) = Pr(T t and J = 1), associated with death, as t \u2192 \u221e, where T denotes the time from onset to death (J = 1) or recovery (J = 2). When censoring is present, however, estimation of F 1 (\u221e) is complicated by the possibility of little information regarding the right tail of F 1 , requiring use of estimators of F 1 (t * ) or F 1 (t * )/(F 1 (t * ) + F 2 (t * )) where t * is large, with F 2 (t) = Pr(T t and J = 2) being the analogous sub-distribution function associated with recovery. With right censored data, the variability of such estimators increases as t * increases, suggesting the possibility of using estimators at lower values of t * where bias may be increased but overall mean squared error be smaller. These issues are investigated here for non-parametric estimators of F 1 and F 2 . The ideas are illustrated on case fatality",

Note that observation of the product term J simply means that the cause of failure-either death or recovery-is known whenever an uncensored event is observed, but not otherwise. We assume that the censoring random variable C follows an unknown distribution function G. In Section 2 we review non-parametric procedures for estimation of F 1 (t) and F 2 (t), leading to estimatorsF 1 (t) andF 2 (t). The presence of right censoring complicates non-parametric estimation of F 1 (\u221e) as information on the value of F 1 may run out before the sub-distribution function is close to its asymptotic limit. Given this obstacle, two estimation strategies have been suggested for F 1 (\u221e). First, we can estimate F 1 (\u221e) by 1984 N. P. JEWELL ET AL.",

In Section 3 we use some limited simulations to assess the performance of estimators of CFR a and CFR b , and also compare different estimators of their sampling variability, namely (i) the (asymptotic) estimated variance based on influence curve calculations, (ii) a Greenwood-type estimator of the asymptotic variance, (iii) a simple bootstrap variance estimate, and (iv) an asymptotic approximation suggested by Cox [2, 4] .

However, the estimate CFR a is based onF 1 (t * ) at a perhaps randomly selected time t * , as when using the largest observed death time. Similarly, CFR b is evaluated at a randomly selected t * . The asymptotic variance estimators do not account for variability associated with determination of t * . An alternative estimator of the variance that does allow for the random choice of t * is based on the bootstrap technique. For specific implementation, bootstrap samples of Y = (T , , J ) of size n are randomly selected, with replacement, from the original data. The choice of the number of bootstrap samples is delicate and is discussed in detail in Shao and Tu [17] . As a rule of thumb they suggest 50-200 bootstrap samples for moment estimators like the variance used here. In the simulations of Section 3 and the example in Section 4, we therefore use 200 bootstrap samples. If computational considerations are not of concern, the number of bootstrap samples can be increased until stability in the variance estimates is achieved.",

For each simulation, the estimators, CFR a and CFR b at t max , and CFR b at the data-driven optimal t opt (as described in Section 3) and their estimated variances (based on the appropriate influence curve, Greenwood formula, Cox approximation or bootstrap for CFR a and CFR b ; only the Greenwood formula and Cox approximation for CFR b at t opt for computational reasons) were computed. Either the Greenwood formula or the Cox approximation was used in evaluating estimated mean squared error in choosing the value t opt for each data set. For the bootstrap variance estimator, 200 bootstrap samples with replacement were generated; since t max will vary across these pseudo-samples, this method accounts for this form of variation unlike the other methods. For the two sample sizes, n = 100 and 1500, the simulation mean and variance of three estimators are reported in Tables I and II, mean of corresponding variance estimators and the empirical coverage of nominal 95 per cent confidence intervals based on each variance estimator. Generally, CFR a exhibits a little more bias and variability than CFR b , as can be expected from the shapes of F 1 and F 1 /(F 1 + F 2 ) as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 . For all estimators, the bias is worst in scenarios II and III where it is considerable due to heavier censoring in the tail of F 1 and F 2 . The estimator, CFR b , evaluated at t opt , is more biased as expected, but also displays the anticipated gains in precision. Figure 3 shows the behaviour of bias squared, variance, and mean squared error for a typical data set with n = 100 from simulation scenario III. Similar figures can be examined for any particular data set. Unfortunately, overall increases in bias entirely offset decreases in variance so that the mean squared error is actually slightly higher when using t opt as compared to t max , at least in these limited situations. Note that this persists even with a much larger sample size. In large part, this is due to the tendency of the Cox and Greenwood variance estimators to underestimate the true variability so that t opt is selected to allow for too much bias. This phenomenon is likely to ameliorate somewhat if the bootstrap variance is used instead. For n = 100, the simulation means of the four variance estimators are all reasonably close to their actual variance, with somewhat better performance for CFR b than for CFR a . For CFR b evaluated at t opt , the Cox approximation does not perform as well with a tendency to substantially underestimate variability in scenarios II and III as compared to the Greenwood estimator.",

The original data included 124 patients who were in hospital prior to onset of SARS and who therefore had other, possibly serious, conditions that could potentially bias upwards estimates of the CFR; hence it is sensible to exclude these patients when estimating a CFR intended to be applicable to the general population. The date of recovery refers to the final date of discharge from a health-care facility (not just the acute care hospital of first admission)-no recovered individuals subsequently died of SARS-related causes. A further 25 cases were not used because either their final outcome or discharge date was unknown. To illustrate the estimators and their associated variability, we analyse the data as they would have been observed at seven different time points, weekly starting with 2 April 2003, during which period the epidemic almost doubled in size. Table III provides the estimates CFR a and CFR b , along with various variability estimates, at each of the seven times noted (as before we used 200 bootstrap samples with replacement). The level of censoring at the various analysis times is provided. As background, the mean time to outcome (death or recovery) was a little more than three weeks. The epidemic of infections peaked in late March, but given the lag time between infection and outcome, 84 per cent of existing case outcomes remained unknown at the beginning of April, reflecting very heavy censoring for the earliest analyses of Table III . Given the simulation results of Section 3, we thus expect CFR estimates in the first four weeks of April to exhibit large bias.",

Alternative estimators of the same asymptotic variance have much better performance. This is not surprising in light of the standard Kaplan-Meier estimator where Greenwood's formula is much more stable than plug-in estimates of the influence curve under heavy censoring. Both the Greenwood estimator and the Cox approximation are plausible alternatives in the situations considered here, although it remains to be proved that the latter approximation is always asymptotically correct.

[12] , a consistent estimator of the covariance of the estimator\u015d F 1 (t) andF 2 (t) is given byFurther, a Greenwood estimate of the asymptotic variance ofF j (t) is given byNoting that log\u015c(t) = t i <t log(1 \u2212\u0125 i ), where\u0125 i \u2261 d i /n i , it follows from the delta method that cov(\u015c(s),\u015c(t)) =\u015c(s)\u015c(t) t i <s d i /n i (n i \u2212 d i ) for s t estimates the asymptotic covariance of the Kaplan-Meier estimator at two times s and t. Cox suggested ignoring the covariance between h i j = d i j /n i and\u015c(t k \u2212 ) for any i, j, k, so that we can again use the delta method on (1) to yieldwhere h 1 = (\u0125 11 , . . . ,\u0125 k1 ) with t k being the largest event time t, and the variance-covariance matrix of S k \u2261 (\u015c(t 1 \u2212 ), . . . ,\u015c(t k \u2212 )). An analogous approximation obtains for var(F 2 (t)). We note that this provides a simple approximation to the variance of CFR a , although, in this case, the estimator (C1) does not reduce to a standard multinomial estimator although the ignored covariance terms are of smaller order. (In fact, putting in the correct covariance terms for all the relevant\u0125 i j and\u015c(t k \u2212 ) provides an alternative method for computation of a Greenwood variance formula.)",
