Their vagility hinders data collection on abundance and distribution, which constrains modeling efforts and our understanding of bat ecology, viral dynamics, and spillover. We addressed this knowledge gap with models and data on the occurrence and abundance of nectarivorous fruit bat populations at 3 day roosts in southeast Queensland. We used environmental drivers of nectar production as predictors and explored relationships between bat abundance and virus spillover. Specifically, we developed several novel modeling tools motivated by complexities of fruit bat foraging ecology, including: (1) a dataset of spatial variables comprising Eucalypt-focused vegetation indices, cumulative precipitation, and temperature anomaly; (2) an algorithm that associated bat population response with spatial covariates in a spatially and temporally relevant way given our current understanding of bat foraging behavior; and (3) a thorough statistical learning approach to finding optimal covariate combinations. We identified covariates that classify fruit bat occupancy at each of our three study roosts with 86-93% accuracy. Negative binomial models explained 43-53% of the variation in observed abundance across roosts. Our models suggest that spatiotemporal heterogeneity in Eucalypt-based food resources could drive at least 50% of bat population behavior at the landscape scale. We found that 13 spillover events were observed within the foraging range of our study roosts, and they occurred during times when models predicted low population abundance. Our results suggest that, in southeast Queensland, spillover may not be driven by large aggregations of fruit bats attracted by nectar-based resources, but rather by behavior of smaller resident subpopulations. Our models and data integrated remote sensing and statistical learning to make inferences on bat ecology and disease dynamics.

The emergence of Hendra virus is a good study system for questions about host population dynamics and disease emergence because: (1) Reliable data have been collected on viral prevalence, spillover events (transmission from reservoir host to secondary host such as livestock and humans), and host population distributions; and (2) Hendra virus-fruit bat ecological dynamics can provide insights into other important bat-borne viral zoonoses which have emerged in Africa and Asia. Since its emergence in 1994, Hendra virus spillover occurs sporadically and aseasonally in the tropics, but interannually during winter in the subtropics . This curious pattern of Hendra virus spillover has been explored through spatiotemporal surveys of viral prevalence and seroprevalence in bats (Plowright et al. 2008; Breed et al. 2011; Field et al. 2011 Field et al. , 2015b and modeling studies of virus survival under different environmental conditions (Martin et al. 2015 ). Yet, the less explored host population dynamics can have a profound impact on the ecology underlying Hendra virus prevalence and spillover. Hypotheses proposed to explain pulses of infection in bat populations suggest that viral dynamics are intrinsically linked to fluctuations in bat populations (flux) or the food resources that drive these fluctuations, whether through population density effects on transmission, or environmental stress effects on viral excretion ).

The Eucalypts of Australasia are broad-leaf evergreens that undergo continuous cycles of growth and reproduction adapted for animal-mediated pollination. Regional Eucalypt communities are often diverse, with unique responses to climate, which produce variable annual and interannual phenological cycles depending on the climate regime and species assemblage of the region (Law et al. 2000; Wilson 2003; Keatley and Hudson 2007) . Remotely sensed reflectance and climate data that characterizes temporal changes in the local environment may enable detection of flowering and nectar production. However, to our knowledge, no studies have been published that directly link remotely sensed or climate data to nectar production. Fortunately, ample evidence in the literature provides sound basis for construction of proxy variables for flowering (Lindenmayer et al. 2015) . For example, Eucalypt canopies experience a peak in leaf area during growth phases, which are then followed by decreased vegetative growth and initiation of the flowering process (Ashton 1975; Pook 1984; Pook et al. 1997) . Changes in forest canopy structure and leaf physiology between these phenological cycles are discernible in remotely sensed spectral reflectance data and indices thereof (Coops et al. 1997; Datt 1998 Datt , 1999 Leuning et al. 2005; Ahl et al. 2006; Youngentob et al. 2012) . Additionally, modeling studies show climatic factors, especially changes in temperature and precipitation in the months prior to flowering, are key predictors of the annual timing of flowering events (Keatley et al. 2002; Hudson et al. 2011a,b; Rawal et al. 2014a Rawal et al. , 2015 .

However, maximum population counts were higher at Canungra and presence of at least 1000 individuals was almost continuous.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to accurately model the occurrence of fruit bats at day roosts and explain a significant portion of the variation in abundance over time. Previous work has modeled the spatial extent of bat habitat or potential areas where Hendra virus spillover could occur, based on bat roost locations, regardless of occupancy (Parsons et al. 2010; Hahn et al. 2014a,b; Smith et al. 2014; Thanapongtharm et al. 2015) . Our methods show how models of bat population flux at the roost scale can be built, facilitating landscape-scale spatiotemporal predictions of foraging suitability and bat population distribution. The success of our models (measured by their ability to classify occupancy with~90% accuracy and explain~50% of the variability of abundance) stems from a well-informed suite of proxy variables, a sampling algorithm that relates predictors to population response in an ecologically relevant manner, and a statistical learning algorithm that identifies optimal predictor sets. Models relied most on time-lagged changes of Eucalypt-focused vegetation indices (which likely detect structural changes in the forest canopy as Eucalypts undergo phenological cycles of growth and flowering (Zhang et al. 2003; Ahl et al. 2006 ) and temperature extrema (which trigger synchronized flowering events within species; Moncur 1992; Rawal et al. 2015) , indicating that temporal changes in bat population abundance at these roosts are largely driven by cycles of nectar production in the surrounding landscape. Comparison of spillover to models of occupancy and abundance suggests that (1) spillover near our study roosts occurred when nectar-based resources are predicted to support relatively low population abundance, and (2) the relationship between spillover risk and population abundance may be heterogeneous across the region. This is the first time that spillover has been related to temporal trends in bat population flux driven by nectar foraging suitability, and given the limited data on spillover and high degree of stochasticity in bat disease ecology, further analyses are required. General limitations of our study are worth consideration. First, our analysis focuses on three study roosts because they contain census time series with sufficient sample sizes for robust temporal cross-validation, and spillover events have occurred within their foraging radii, allowing comparison of population flux and spillover. Although many other roosts are found in southeast Queensland, we expect that they exhibit similar seasonal patterns of occupancy based on their proximity to our study roosts. The observed patterns at the three roostsspillover occurring in winter during low predicted population sizesis corroborated by studies showing that viral excretion (Field et al. 2015b ) and spillover in the subtropics are highest in winter, coincident with smaller winter population sizes (Nelson 1965; Eby 1991) . Second, the set of variables which predict bat occurrence and abundance is unique between roosts. This is expected because the assemblage of Eucalypt specieseach with a species-specific flowering response to climate surrounding each roost is unique (Keatley and Hudson 2007; Birtchnell and Gibson 2008) , necessitating an individual model fitted to each roost data set. However, specific predictor-response relationships at the roost scale do not preclude developing landscape-scale models, as discussed below. Third, models detect the pattern of occupancy with high classification accuracy (86-93%); however, predicting bat abundance is more challenging, with 43-53% of the variation in the data accounted for. Given the overdispersion in the abundance data (due to variable population response and human error in estimating census counts) coupled with error/approximation associated with climate and remote sensing variables, accounting for half the variation in bat population response is noteworthy. It should also be noted that foraging behavior in P. alecto and P. poliocephalus is flexible. They primarily feed on nectar and pollen of Eucalypts (Parry-Jones and Augee 1991; Courts 1998); however, when these are unavailable, they can remain at a roost by switching to non-nectar-based resources such as fruits of non-native plants found in urban and peri-urban landscapes (Eby 1998; Markus and Hall 2004; Fahr et al. 2015; Field et al. 2015a) . The extent to which populations utilize, and are able to be supported by, urban and periurban areas is unknown. However, generalist feeding behavior could explain occurrence or high abundance at times when models based on nectar phenology predict absence or low abundance. Furthermore, social drivers of colonial behavior in bats can lead to high peaks in abundance that are not necessarily driven by food abundance (nectar-based or otherwise).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 466, "end": 487, "text": "(Parsons et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 488, "end": 508, "text": "Hahn et al. 2014a,b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 509, "end": 527, "text": "Smith et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 528, "end": 555, "text": "Thanapongtharm et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 1338, "end": 1357, "text": "(Zhang et al. 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 1358, "end": 1373, "text": "Ahl et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1474, "end": 1492, "text": "Rawal et al. 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 2911, "end": 2930, "text": "(Field et al. 2015b", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3036, "end": 3049, "text": "(Nelson 1965;", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 3050, "end": 3059, "text": "Eby 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3311, "end": 3336, "text": "(Keatley and Hudson 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 3337, "end": 3364, "text": "Birtchnell and Gibson 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 4441, "end": 4451, "text": "(Eby 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 4452, "end": 4473, "text": "Markus and Hall 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 4474, "end": 4491, "text": "Fahr et al. 2015;", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 4492, "end": 4511, "text": "Field et al. 2015a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our models provide an important observation related to the temporal relationship between pathogen spillover and bat population dynamics due to nectar foraging; that is, Hendra virus spillover in this region is likely not driven by large groups of migratory bats that feed on nectar and pollen of Eucalypts. Most Hendra virus spillover events occur in winter in southeast Queensland when our abundance models predict relatively low (mean of 3020) population sizes at roosts. Interpretation of spillover risk based on our models and data alone is speculative; however, they support the hypothesis that spillover may be associated with resident sedentary subpopulations that choose to remain in the roost and subsist on urban-based resources when nectar availability is low . General foraging behavior of fruit bats allows them to form sedentary populations in response to both seasonal changes in nectar availability and loss of foraging habitat. If winter population sizes approach or surpass the seasonal carrying capacity of the landscape, and food resources are limited, part of the population may also suffer from nutritional stress. Further, lower night time temperatures may increase caloric requirement and the cost of immune functioning (Hawley and Altizer 2011) , facilitating winter nutritional stress, which Plowright et al. (2015) propose may lead to increased viral shedding. Although physiological stress is a recurrent theme in disease ecology (Hawley and Altizer 2011; Brearley et al. 2013; Hing et al. 2016 ) and has been observed in the Hendra virus disease system (Plowright et al. 2008) , its role in Hendra virus spillover is difficult to determine without additional data on chronic or periodic states of stress in bats (McMichael et al. 2014) .

Parry-Jones and Augee (1991) observed remarkable variability in P. poliocephalus in the proportion of diet comprised of nectar and pollen of Eucalypts (28-86% depending on the year and season). Therefore, we hypothesize long-term shifts toward a more urbanbased diet with less migration in bat foraging behavior as foraging habitat becomes fragmented and the cost of migrating for a nectar dominated diet increases. Dramatic landscape changes in southeast Queensland began to accelerate in the early 1990s (just prior to Hendra virus emergence in 1994 (Bradshaw 2012 ). Additionally, modeling studies suggest Eucalypts may respond to climate changes with increased asynchrony and decreased intensity of flowering events (Keatley et al. 2002; Hudson et al. 2009 Hudson et al. , 2011a Butt et al. 2013; Rawal et al. 2013 Rawal et al. , 2014a Rawal et al. ,b, 2015 . The combined effect of habitat fragmentation and climate changes may be decreased abundance, increased spatial heterogeneity, and increased asynchrony of nectar resources. Together, these processes may decrease the overall amount of energy available across the landscape and increase the energetic cost of a mobile foraging strategy based primarily on nectar resources (Calcagno et al. 2014) . It is plausible that the past 25 years of landscape and climate changes in southeast Queensland have altered the ecological behavior of nectar-seeking in fruit bats leading to supplementation with non-nectar resources in peri-urban areas, consequently diminishing the ability of models based on nectar resources to explain bat abundance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 116, "end": 122, "text": "(2004)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 123, "end": 129, "text": "(2005)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 130, "end": 136, "text": "(2006)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 137, "end": 143, "text": "(2007)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 144, "end": 150, "text": "(2008)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 151, "end": 157, "text": "(2009)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 158, "end": 164, "text": "(2010)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 165, "end": 171, "text": "(2011)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 172, "end": 178, "text": "(2012)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 179, "end": 185, "text": "(2013)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 186, "end": 192, "text": "(2014)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 911, "end": 925, "text": "(Bradshaw 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1100, "text": "(Keatley et al. 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1101, "end": 1119, "text": "Hudson et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1120, "end": 1141, "text": "Hudson et al. , 2011a", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1159, "text": "Butt et al. 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1177, "text": "Rawal et al. 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 1178, "end": 1198, "text": "Rawal et al. , 2014a", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 1199, "end": 1220, "text": "Rawal et al. ,b, 2015", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1592, "end": 1614, "text": "(Calcagno et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The tools we have developed for modeling bat population abundance at day roosts is an important first step to understand spatiotemporal dynamics of existing nectar resources. Pteropus alecto and Pteropus poliocephalus rely on large population sizes to search out patchy and ephemeral pulses of nectar resources, making it difficult to define discrete spatial limits of suitable habitat (Eby et al. 1999) . Techniques to estimate the distribution of nectar-based resources are important, because they can inform about habitat loss over time, potential seasonal nectar shortages, and times and areas when bat populations are likely to rely more on urban-based resources leading to increased risk of spillover. Expanding models to the landscape scale could be achieved with the same spatial sampling techniques to construct datasets for additional locations, but would use regression trees, which allow multiple predictor-response relationships within datasets, thereby permitting prediction of nectar-driven population density across space and time. This can direct better-informed policy decisions concerning the conservation of bat foraging habitat, which has become a pressing question as humans and bats increasingly compete for habitat.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 386, "end": 403, "text": "(Eby et al. 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The results presented here demonstrate that indices of Eucalypt leaf physiology can be approximated with spectral reflectance data, and when combined with climate variables representing anomalies over time, they are effective predictors of fruit bat population flux.

Future work will enable identification of habitat areas of high conservation priority that consider the complexities of bat foraging ecology. These can be extended to other ecological systems where fruit bat populations are driven by food resource phenology, such as African fruit bats, which migrate among Miombo forests (Richter and Cumming 2006) , and Asian fruit bats that follow the phenology of Durian fruit and petai bean (Epstein et al. 2009 ).
