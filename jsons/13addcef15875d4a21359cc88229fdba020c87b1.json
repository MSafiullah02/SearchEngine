            "text": "The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 has led to unprecedented changes in the daily lives of Americans. Measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including social distancing and sheltering in place, limit people's ability to maintain social, relational, and sexual connections and, accordingly, may have dramatic consequences for people's psychological well-being. [1, 2] Social isolation, which is essentially mandated to reduce transmission of coronavirus, has been previously linked to loneliness and negative mental health outcomes in numerous populations. [3, 4] Further, recent research has shown that the spread of COVID-19 and the related public health response have had negative effects on people's emotional wellbeing, [5] [6] [7] [8] with more than one-third of American adults reporting serious changes in their mental health due to the COVID-19 spread and response. [9, 10] Under normal conditions, depression is common worldwide and has a significant health burden, affecting some 264 million people each year, according to the World Health Organization. [11] Loneliness is also prevalent and strongly correlated with adverse mental and physical health outcomes, including depression. [12] In the United States, depression has increased among adults over the last decade, [13] largely among young adults and women. [14] Recent estimates from the National Institute of Mental Health indicate that 17.3 million American adults (7.1%) experienced a major depressive episode in 2017. [15] Loneliness tends to follow similar demographic trends as depression, with elevated levels observed in women and young adults, but also among low-income and unmarried people. [12, 16] While previous studies have evaluated the psychological consequences of other respiratory disease epidemics, [17] [18] [19] [20] few studies have been conducted to assess these outcomes related to the current pandemic of coronavirus . [5] [6] [7] To our knowledge, no COVID- 19-era study has yet estimated the population-representative prevalence of depression and loneliness .

We measured loneliness with the UCLA 3-item Loneliness scale.

Few endorsed these final two remote sexual exposures at high frequency, so for those we combined the '1-3 times a week' and 'almost every day' responses. We also assessed relationship tension among participants reporting romantic relationship. We measured romantic tension with an item that queried whether participants noted increased tension or arguments with their partner due to COVID-19 spread and restrictions.

Close touching in family interactions and among relationship partners has been associated with decreased heart rate, higher levels of oxytocin, and lower levels of cortisol; [32, 33] which, in turn could provide important mental health protections. These kinds of connections cannot easily be recreated with remote technology where direct touch is not possible, though some researchers have explored this through \"huggable\" and other similar communication devices. [34] We also know that common technical difficulties with video calls can cause misattributed negative feelings towards people on the call, [35] perhaps contributing to the null effects we observed for remote connections and mental health outcomes. As the COVID-19 spread and response have dramatically limited access to many previously routine and familiar options for human connection, our findings are consistent with an explanation that the decreased frequency of social and sexual connections is contributing to poor mental health outcomes. In addition to limiting people's social interactions, restrictions have also likely resulted in many people missing counselling or therapy appointments or other activities (e.g., exercise, massage, support group meetings, etc.) that may have been supportive of their mental health.",

First, people who are struggling with poor mental health and feelings of isolation during COVID-19 restrictions may be reaching out more frequently for remote connections. As this was a cross-sectional study, our ability to infer temporality is limited. Future studies with a longitudinal design would be better able to disentangle the temporal relationships between social/sexual connections and mental health outcomes. Second, we used self-reported data for our key exposure and outcome assessments, with the potential for biased results. However, web-based surveys have shown to be effective modes to elicit sensitive sexual behaviors from study participants, alleviating some of the bias concern.",

[24, 27] However, their use could be complemented with clinical assessments in future studies. Relatedly, it is not yet known how these scales perform during times of social restrictions when daily lives have shifted so dramatically. It is possible that the wording of certain items (e.g. 'How often do you feel isolated from others?') may lose their discriminatory ability in times where isolation is essentially mandated. For this reason, we used a more conservative categorical definition of loneliness (scale score of 6 or greater) for our analyses than has been commonly used in prior studies (scale score of 4 or greater). We also did not explore whether participants had run out of prescription medication supportive of their mental health or had missed counselling or therapy visits.",
