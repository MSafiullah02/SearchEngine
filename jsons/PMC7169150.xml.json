This leads to capillary leakage and eventual inhomogeneous alveolar flooding.4, 5 Alveolar flooding is a process of fluid leakage with active/passive transport driven by ion movement or hydrostatic pressure. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulation conductance has shown participation in alveolar fluid transport to the capillary compartment. Inhibition of chloride transport worsens lung injury induced by lipopolysaccharide in a rodent model, suggesting inhibition of active fluid transport may delay lung injury recovery.6 Among various risk factors, bile acid aspiration induces lung injury through p38 and c\u2010Jun N\u2010terminal kinase phosphorylation, as well as cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase\u20102 production, which results in attenuation of junctional proteins such as occludin, zonula occludens\u20101 and E\u2010cadherin.7 Similarly in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa\u2010induced lung injury model, claudins \u20103, \u20104 and \u201018 are significantly upregulated with the degree of bronchoalveolar lavage claudin level being associated with lung injury score.8 These results strongly suggested protection against lung injury occurs through junctional protein expression in alveolar epithelium.",

Smoking was commoner in sarcoid patients than in age\u2010matched controls in almost all deciles of age apart from men in their 30s.

However, there was some concern from earlier work that the differing algorithms used by various manufacturers may affect the efficacy of some devices in controlling apnoea and snoring.73, 74 Damiani and colleagues evaluated the effectiveness of two autotitrating CPAP devices driven by different flow\u2010based algorithms in determining a therapeutic pressure for fixed CPAP.75 Both devices tested by the authors gave similar pressure recommendations as well as providing significant and similar improvements in sleep and breathing. One of the purported advantages of autotitrating CPAP is that a lower mean overnight pressure may be delivered to the patient. This can be beneficial in terms of pressure tolerance and side\u2010effects. However, Luo and colleagues found in their Chinese population that pressures derived from the auto\u2010titration were consistently greater that those determined by manual titration.76 As identified by the authors, this may reflect the greater sensitivity of the flow sensor within the autotitrating CPAP device detecting and responding to flow limitation compared with the thermistor used during the manual titration. This study and that of Damiani et al. highlight the need for long\u2010term studies to evaluate whether clinically important outcome differences exist between different devices and approaches to titration.75\n",

With this in mind, Anandam et al. undertook a large observational study of 570 patients with severe OSA (apnoea\u2010hypopnoea index \u226530/h) followed up for a median period of over 5 years.77 All patients initially received CPAP, although only 177 continued on this therapy over the study period. Another 72 patients were switched to a mandibular advancement splint (MAS), and 212 declined intervention. A control group of 208 individuals with an apnoea\u2010hypopnoea index <5/h were followed over the same time period. Cumulative cardiovascular mortality of the CPAP\u2010 and MAS\u2010treated groups were similar to that of the control group, and mortality in all three groups was significantly lower than the untreated severe OSA group. However, no difference in mortality between patients treated with CPAP or MAS was seen even though patients treated with MAS had a higher residual apnoea\u2010hypopnoea index compared with CPAP\u2010treated individuals (16.3 + 5.1/h vs 4.5 + 2.3/h; P < 0.001). While observational, the results from this study are consistent with the findings from a recent 3\u2010month randomized trial comparing MAS to CPAP therapy in patients with the full spectrum of OSA severity.78 As with the Anandam study,77 short\u2010term health outcomes were similar despite residual events being higher in the MAS\u2010treated group. As discussed in the editorial by Vanderveken,79 the similarity in outcomes between the two therapies likely arise from higher compliance with MAS offsetting its lower efficacy. To date, a major limitation with MAS has been the inability to objectively monitor compliance. However, this will change with the recent development of microsensor technology permitting chips to be embedded within these devices, enabling more accurate usage monitoring.80\n",

The addition of an inspiratory resistance decreased respiratory rate and increased tidal volume and was associated with a reduction in the velocity of diaphragmatic contraction, while diaphragmatic excursion did not change from that observed with just a mouthpiece and nose clip.

Two studies in Respirology in 2013 made significant contributions to understanding of the pathophysiology of this complex condition. Kabata et al.105 report that the prevalence of mutations in the gene for bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (a receptor associated with the abnormal proliferation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cell dysfunction) was similar in Japanese patients with PAH when compared with that reported in other populations. Furthermore, long\u2010term survival in PAH was unaffected by mutation status.105 In contrast, Edwards et al.106 investigated changes in peripheral lymphocytes in patients with idiopathic PAH and connective tissue disease associated PH compared with healthy controls and correlated these changes with transplant free survival. The study demonstrates that deficient levels of cytotoxic CD8+ T\u2010lymphocytes and natural killer cells in patients with PAH are associated with increased risk of death.

SPO2 values were compared with arterialized capillary samples measured before and during treadmill walking. The authors demonstrate that compared with arterialized samples, SPO2 was 2% lower and 2% higher with finger and forehead oximetry, respectively. The authors correctly state that arterialized capillary blood commonly has slightly lower oxygenation than arterial values113 suggesting that the forehead measurements are likely more accurate.
