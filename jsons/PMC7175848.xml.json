            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has spread rapidly across the world due to its high transmissibility and pathogenicity (Munster et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is a distinct clade of beta coronaviruses encompassing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Lu et al., 2020). Although most cases of the disease caused by most pathogenic coronaviruses are mild (Su et al., 2016), the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks in 2002 and 2012, respectively, demonstrated their high lethality (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). SARS-CoV-2 bears an 82% resemblance to the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV (Chan et al., 2020); however, COVID-19 presents a lower case fatality rate and higher infectiousness than SARS, with mortality rates of approximately 3.7% for COVID-19 and 10% for SARS (WHO, 2003, WHO, 2020a). COVID-19 patients often exhibit mild symptoms, such as fever, cough, myalgia, and fatigue and generally have a good prognosis. However, a large proportion of COVID-19 cases have rapidly progressed to severe types, especially among older men with underlying diseases (Chen et al., 2020c, Huang et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2020c, Wang et al., 2020a). Severe cases can include dyspnea (Lin et al., 2020), shock (Wang et al., 2020a), organ dysfunction [acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)] (Guan et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020a, Xu et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2020, Yao et al., 2020), acute cardiac injury (Han et al., 2020a, Strabelli and Uip, 2020, Wang et al., 2020a, Yao et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2020a), acute kidney injury (Guan et al., 2020, Li et al., 2020a, Pan et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020a, Yao et al., 2020), acute liver injury (Xie et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2020, Yao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a), neurological injury (Mao et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2020), gastrointestinal injury (Yao et al., 2020), immune injury (Chen et al., 2020b, Guan et al., 2020, Qin et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020b, Xu et al., 2020, Yao et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2020b, Zheng et al., 2020), coagulation impairment (Han et al., 2020b, Tang et al., 2020a), and even death (Huang et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020a) (Fig. 1\n). In addition, COVID-19 pandemic has great impact on psychological stress and mental health worldwide (Bao et al., 2020, Kang et al., 2020, Li et al., 2020, Pfefferbaum and North, 2020, Shi et al., 2020a).",

A recent study indicated that remdesivir efficiently protected a human cell line against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Wang et al., 2020c). Treatment with intravenous remdesivir successfully improved the clinical state of the first U.S. COVID-19 patient (Holshue et al., 2020). Remdesivir is now being tested in several clinical trials designed to evaluate its efficacy and safety for the treatment of COVID-19. Notably, Gilead Sciences announced the result of a very recent clinical study on the efficacy of remdesivir on COVID-19 (Grein et al., 2020). In this report, 53 patients infected with severe COVID-19 were tracked, and 34 patients of whom were critically ill, with 30 patients requiring mechanical ventilation and 4 patients relying on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Over a median follow-up of 18 days, 36 patients (68%) presented with improved oxygen-support class. 20 patients of 34 severely ill patients showed improvement in clinical conditions, with 17 of 30 patients stopped receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and 3 of 4 patients stopped receiving ECMO treatment respectively. The treatment of remdesivir limited the mortality rate of seriously ill patients needing invasive ventilation to 18%, and 5% for those who did not needed. Generally, the efficacy of remdesivir reflected in this study is hopeful. However, the sample size of this study was quite small, and definite effectiveness of remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 needs to be further verified (Table 1\n).",

Concomitant use of ritonavir could increase the plasma half-life of lopinavir through cytochrome P450 inhibition in the liver. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, LPV-r was reported to have in vitro inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV (Chu et al., 2004a), and combination therapy of LPV-r and ribavirin provided favorable results in treating patients with SARS (Fig. 2) (Chu et al., 2004b). Triple combination therapy with LPV-r, ribavirin, and IFN-\u03b1 has shown clinical effectiveness for MERS (Kim et al., 2016). Notwithstanding, a recent open-label randomized study with 199 patients in Wuhan showed that LPV-r monotherapy did not produce any therapeutic benefits for COVID-19 patients compared with standard supportive care, which might be caused by the higher throat viral loads in the LPV-r group, concurrent pharmacologic interventions, and late treatment initiation (Table 1) (Cao et al., 2020). The enrolled COVID-19 patients were critically ill, and LPV-r treatment might have been started relatively late. However, in another retrospective cohort study, combination therapy of LPV-r and arbidol was associated with improved pulmonary computed tomography images (Deng et al., 2020). Collectively, the combination therapy of LPV-r and other antiviral agents in early stages of COVID-19 infection might hold promise for treating COVID-19.",

            "text": "Favipiravir, also known as Avigan\u00ae and originally developed and approved for the influenza virus infection epidemic in Japan, has a broad spectrum of antiviral activity (Furuta et al., 2013). Once it enters cells, favipiravir undergoes phosphorylation to convert into its active phosphorylated form (favipinavir-RTP), which potently inhibits viral RNA polymerase, thereby interfering with viral genome replication (Fig. 2) (Furuta et al., 2005). Favipiravir demonstrated efficacy in inhibiting a wide range of viruses, including resistant influenza viruses and other RNA viruses, such as arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, and filoviruses (Delang et al., 2018). Previous studies have showed that favipiravir is efficacious against Ebola virus in rodent models (Oestereich et al., 2014, Smither et al., 2014), while its effectiveness in humans is unproven (Sissoko et al., 2016). Favipiravir appears to be effective in COVID-19. Two clinical trials involving a total of 340 patients were conducted in Wuhan and Shenzhen. At a press conference in March 17, 2020, Xinmin Zhang, an official of China\u2019s Science and Technology Ministry, stated that favipiravir appeared to be effective in COVID-19 (Hackett, 2020). Preliminary clinical data from 80 patients in the Third People\u2019s Hospital of Shenzhen suggested that favipiravir exerted antiviral effects more potently than LPV-r, with no overt adverse reactions (Third People's, 2020). The other clinical trial in Wuhan showed that, based on conventional therapy, favipiravir demonstrated higher efficacy than arbidol in terms of the 7-day recovery rate and duration of symptom attenuation in patients with moderate COVID-19 infection (Chen et al., 2020a). Taken together, the clinical results of favipiravir are favorable (Table 1); however, further study of favipiravir monotherapy using a large sample size is needed.",

Based on EIDD-1931, an orally bioavailable ribonucleotide analog, EIDD-2801 is designed to optimize oral bioavailability and improve drug uptake in humans and non-human primates (Fig. 2). EIDD-1931 has a variety of antiviral activities against numerous causal agents of deleterious viral infectious diseases, including influenza, chikungunya, Ebola, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and coronavirus-associated diseases (Agostini et al., 2019, Painter et al., 2019, Reynard et al., 2015, Toots et al., 2019). As a ribonucleotide analog, EIDD-1931 shares similar mechanisms of action with remdesivir and exerts antiviral effects by mimicking a ribonucleotide, thereby mistakenly being incorporated into viral RNA, leading to lethal mutagenesis during virion RNA synthesis and inhibiting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase encoded by the virus during viral replication (Fig. 2) (Painter et al., 2019, Sheahan et al., 2020). The study suggested that EIDD-1931 robustly blocked the replication of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 in cell assays. EIDD-2801 demonstrated its prophylactic and therapeutic effects in murine models of SARS and MERS, showing diminished viral lung titers, attenuated weight loss, ameliorated lung damage, and improved pulmonary function, which are dependent on the administered dosage and the treatment initiation time. Compared with remdesivir, EIDD-2801 appears to be favorable. EIDD-2801 has a more convenient oral administration, while remdesivir must rely on intravenous administration by a trained specialist. More importantly, EIDD-2801 showed active antiviral activity against remdesivir-resistant viruses, according to the data presented by the study. Of significant importance, EIDD-1931 appeared to be effective not just for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, but also other coronavirus species, indicating its potential efficacy for emerging coronaviruses in the future. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an Investigational New Drug application for EIDD-2801, and clinical studies in humans are expected to start as soon as possible (Table 1) (BioSpace, 2020).",

Convalescent plasma has been successfully employed to treat numerous infectious diseases, including the 2003 SARS-CoV-1 epidemic, 2009\u20132010 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic, and 2012 MERS-CoV epidemic (Dodd, 2012, Hung et al., 2011, Mair-Jenkins et al., 2015), for which modern medicine has no specifically effective treatment. In the absence of specific antiviral agents and vaccines for COVID-19, clinical trials have been conducted aimed at investigating the efficacy of convalescent plasma in treating COVID-19. A very recently published study by Chinese researchers confirmed the efficacy of convalescent plasma in controlling SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1) (Roback and Guarner, 2020). The report suggested that COVID-19 patients showed signs of improvement approximately 1 week after convalescent plasma transfusion. Another clinical study involved 10 critically ill patients infected with COVID-19 from 3 different hospitals in Wuhan suggested high-titer convalescent plasma transfusion can effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2, leading to impeded inflammatory responses and improved symptom conditions without severe adverse events. All 10 patients receiving convalescent plasma transfusion showed improvement of clinical outcomes or were cured and discharged from hospital (Duan et al., 2020). Given the clinical effectiveness of convalescent plasma, the FDA has granted clinical permission for applying convalescent plasma to the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients (FDA, 2020).",

            "text": "ACE2 serves as a negative regulator of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and is widely distributed among lung tissue and many extrapulmonary tissues, including brain, heart, liver, kidney, endothelium, and intestine (Fig. 2) (Crackower et al., 2002, Ding et al., 2004, Hamming et al., 2004). Of them, alveolar epithelial type \u2161 cells possess an abundance of ACE2 receptors (Zhao et al., 2020). Unfortunately, ACE2 is also a functional receptor of SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003) and SARS-CoV-2 (Zhou et al., 2020b). The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 binds to the host ACE2 receptor and then enters target cells (Fig. 2). Critically, SARS-CoV-2 shows higher affinity for ACE2 than SARS-CoV (Wrapp et al., 2020). Moreover, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 contains a site that can be recognized and activated by a host enzyme called furin, which is highly expressed in the lungs (Coutard et al., 2020). These findings might provide strong evidence for the high pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Due to the pivotal role of widely distributed ACE2 in the entry and replication of viruses, blocking S protein binding to ACE2 might offer some protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 1). A study using a murine model of SARS showed that SARS-CoV S protein binding to ACE2 led to RAS downregulation and consequently contributed to severe lung injury (Imai et al., 2005). Therefore, recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) might protect host lungs against infection through an enhanced ACE2 level to neutralize the S protein on the SARS-CoV-2 surface. Clinical evidence has demonstrated the safety of rhACE2 application (Haschke et al., 2013, Khan et al., 2017). A recent in vitro study demonstrated that the fusion protein of rhACE2 with an Fc fragment shows high affinity binding to the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 and potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 (Lei et al., 2020). Additionally, the findings from a newly online published report in Cell were strongly supportive of potential efficacy of rhACE2 for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Monteil et al., 2020). The study showed that clinical-grade human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) displayed potently inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell cultures and in engineered replicas of human blood vessels and kidneys in a dose-dependent manner. The researchers found that before infecting cells, SARS-CoV-2 co-incubated with hrsACE2, rather than mouse recombinant soluble ACE2, demonstrated dropped activity to infect cells. In the organoid level, administration of hrsACE2 significantly blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection in both engineered human blood vessels and kidneys without observed toxicity. However, note that this study focused on the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is still unclear whether hrsACE2 can play a role in the later infection process. Taken together, it is likely that rhACE2 has potentially curative effectiveness in COVID-19. A clinical trial is underway to investigate the efficacy of rhACE2 in the treatment of COVID-19 (NCT04287686) (Table 1).",

However, evidence has shown that RAS activation and decreased ACE2 expression contribute to the pathological process of lung injury after SARS-CoV infection (Kuba et al., 2005). Serum angiotensin II levels are markedly elevated and exhibit a linear positive correlation to viral load and lung injury in COVID-19 (Liu et al., 2020d). Consequently, the effects of ACEIs/ARBs on lung-specific ACE2 expression in COVID-19 remain unknown. ACEIs/ARBs might have a dual role in COVID-19. On the one hand, the elevated ACE2 level might increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, while on the other, ACE2 activation and RAS deregulation might ameliorate the acute lung injury, heart injury, and renal damage induced by SARS-CoV-2 (Guo et al., 2020). However, there has been no definite evidence on whether taking ACEIs/ARBs is beneficial or harmful for COVID-19 infected patients.",

CQ and HCQ exert antiviral function through various mechanisms. CQ has been shown to interfere with the glycosylation process of ACE2 in host cells, thereby inhibiting the efficiency of the binding of S protein with ACE2, in turn disrupting the virus/cell fusion process (Fig. 3) (Savarino et al., 2006). CQ can increase the pH of acidic cellular organelles required for virus entry into host cells (Savarino et al., 2003). In addition to its direct antiviral activity, CQ and HCQ can attenuate major \u201ccytokine storms\u201d (an overreaction of the immune system causing inflammatory \u201cstorms\u201d) by decreasing cytokine production (interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF], etc.) (Fig. 3) (van den Borne et al., 1997). Notably, high cytokine concentrations have been observed in seriously ill COVID-19 patients (Huang et al., 2020), indicating that over-reactive immune responses exacerbate COVID-19. Therefore, the immune-modulating activity of HCQ might partially account for its efficient control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. CQ and HCQ are therefore promising drugs of choice for large-scale use due to their low cost, wide availability and potential efficacy for treating COVID-19. CQ and HCQ need to be administered with caution when treating COVID-19 infection to prevent toxicity.",

TCZ and sarilumab efficiently inhibit IL-6 through both membrane-bound and soluble IL-6R (Fig. 3) (Raimondo et al., 2017, Sakkas, 2016). TCZ has been approved by the FDA for treating cytokine release syndrome marked by excessive cytokine production and consequently rapid multiorgan damage (lungs, kidney, and heart) (Shimabukuro-Vornhagen et al., 2018). COVID-19 disease severity depends on the increase in pro-inflammatory factors [IL-6, IL-1, IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, and TNF-\u03b1] (Huang et al., 2020, Ruan et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2020a), suggesting that cytokine storms are involved in the development of COVID-19. One of the key cytokines involved in the immune system perturbation is IL-6 (Mehta et al., 2020). As IL-6 receptor antagonists, TCZ and sarilumab have therefore been hypothesized to exert suppressive effects on exuberant and dysfunctional systematic inflammation in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and further improve patients\u2019 condition. Three clinical trials (ChiCTR2000030196, ChiCTR2000030442, and ChiCTR2000029765) for TCZ have been approved for COVID-19, and the National Health and Family Planning Commission of China has approved the treatment with TCZ in patients with elevated IL-6 level. (Table 1) (NHPFC, 2020). Encouraging results have been seen in Italy where three seriously ill patients administered TCZ showed the signs of improvement (Italian ANSA News Agency, 2020). According to the announcement from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi on March 16, 2020, a phase \u2161/III clinical trial in the U.S. for sarilumab has been conducted to assess its therapeutic effects in patients with severe COVID-19 infection (Table 1) (Regeneron, 2020).",

VEGF produced by various inflammatory and epithelial cells is a potent vascular permeability inducer (Dvorak et al., 1995). Previous reports have shown that plasma VEGF levels markedly increase in patients with ARDS (Thickett et al., 2001). Given the causal link between ARDS and increased vascular permeability and pulmonary edema (Fanelli and Ranieri, 2015). Bevacizumab might be a potential anti-ARDS therapeutic approach. ARDS is a common complication in severe cases of COVID-19 (Fig. 1). Bevacizumab is therefore likely to be a promising therapy against COVID-19 (Table 1).",

JAK-dependent pathways are responsible for producing a variety of cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of the progression process of COVID-19 characterized by elevated levels of inflammatory factors (e.g., IL-6, IL-7, and IL-2) (O'Shea and Plenge, 2012). Baricitinib also serves as an inhibitor of adaptor-associated kinase 1 (AAK1, a member of the numb-associated kinase family), which plays a central role in regulating endocytosis through which the virus invades host cells (Fig. 3) (Richardson et al., 2020). Therefore, baricitinib might exert beneficial effects on COVID-19 pneumonia, not only by impeding overexuberant immune responses by hijacking cytokine signaling pathways but also preventing SARS-CoV-2 from entering host cells. However, blockage of JAK-dependent pathways by baricitinib can also inhibit production of interferons (IFNs) (O'Shea and Plenge, 2012), which might have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 3) (Str\u00f6her et al., 2004). Baricitinib treatment is therefore a double-edged sword (Table 1), and choosing the appropriate time to administer baricitinib is vitally important. For severely ill patients with abnormal biomarkers, cautious baricitinib treatment might yield clinically beneficial effects.",

By virtue of their low immunogenicity (Chamberlain et al., 2007), proven safety (Zheng et al., 2014), and reparative and immunomodulatory properties (Galipeau and Sens\u00e9b\u00e9, 2018, Mei et al., 2010), MSCs are attractive therapeutic candidates for treating a wide range of diseases [e.g., graft-versus-host disease (Le Blanc et al., 2008), sepsis, and ARDS] (Fig. 3) (Asmussen et al., 2014, Krasnodembskaya et al., 2012). A large body of preclinical data has demonstrated the efficacy of MSCs in treating ARDS, manifested in reduced pulmonary edema, decreased plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and reduced mortality rates (Chimenti et al., 2012, Devaney et al., 2015, Xu et al., 2007). Although not fully understood, the mechanisms by which MSCs exert protective effects include their direct regenerative ability and secretion of multiple paracrine factors including antibacterial peptides and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 (Gupta et al., 2012, Gupta et al., 2007). Another attractive property of MSCs is immune response modulation (Aggarwal and Pittenger, 2005). MSCs have been shown to enlarge the proportion of regulatory T cells and decrease pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 3) (Gupta et al., 2012, Li et al., 2012, Prevosto et al., 2007). MSCs showed positive efficacy in a recent study of COVID-19 patients. Treatment with allogenic MSC transplantation at Beijing YouAn Hospital showed significantly improved functional outcomes without obvious adverse effects in 7 COVID-19 patients (Table 1) (Zikuan Leng et al., 2020). Adoptive MSC transfer might therefore be a valuable treatment option for COVID-19.",

Of note, previously published in-vitro studies indicated NO possessed inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV replication (Fig. 2) (Akerstr\u00f6m et al., 2005, Keyaerts et al., 2004a). Moreover, a small-sample clinical study testing the efficacy of iNO in the treatment of SARS showed, 6 severely infected patients receiving iNO therapy presented with improved arterial oxygenation and reduction in a need for ventilator support (Chen et al., 2004). In view of the high incidence of pulmonary complications in COVID-19 infected patients, iNO therapy may serve as a promising candidate for treating severe cases of COVID-19 via alleviating lung damage. Currently, a related phase \u2161 clinical trial testing iNO is underway in COVID-19 infected patients complicated with ARDS (NCT04306393 and NCT04305457).",

Approximately 85% of Chinese COVID-19 patients underwent TCM treatment as reported by XuNanping, the vice minister of Science and Technology of China (China's State Council, 2020). In clinical practice, several kinds of TCM have demonstrated their beneficial effects in treating patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (Ren et al., 2020). Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) has a broad-spectrum antiviral effect on a host of influenza viruses, such as influenza A (H1N1), and HPAI A (H7N9) viruses, by inhibiting viral propagation and regulating immune function (Fig. 3) (Ding et al., 2017, Dong et al., 2014). LHQW has been commonly used for treating viral influenza clinically and played a key role in controlling SARS-CoV during the 2003 outbreak. Recently, LHQW was reported to have inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 and anti-inflammatory effects in vitro (Table 1) (Runfeng et al., 2020).",

Type \u2160 IFNs have demonstrated inhibitory effects on a wide range of viruses including SARS-CoV (Fig. 3) (Minagawa et al., 1987, Sperber and Hayden, 1989, Str\u00f6her et al., 2004, Tan et al., 2004). When they encounter viruses, host cells form and release IFNs, which protect the original and adjacent cells against attack. The antiviral state produces its effects by several means, such as inhibiting viral RNA transcription, protein translation, and post-translational modification (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3) (De Andrea et al., 2002). To date, the clinical effect of IFN intervention in COVID-19 infection is ambiguous. Previous evidence confirmed IFN efficacy in inhibiting SARS-CoV (Cinatl et al., 2003, Sainz et al., 2004). IFN-\u03b1 showed in vitro inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV at concentrations of 1000 IU/ml (Str\u00f6her et al., 2004). Interestingly, recombinant human IFN-\u03b21a within a safe dose range exhibited more potent activity on SARS-CoV (Hensley et al., 2004). As a registered agent for chronic hepatitis C, IFN-\u03b12b was reported to protect type 1 pneumocytes against SARS coronavirus infection in macaques (Haagmans et al., 2004). Combined treatment of IFN-\u03b1-2a and ribavirin was shown to have antiviral effects on MERS-CoV (Falzarano et al., 2013). In addition to their antiviral activity, IFNs show an immunomodulatory capability; type \u2160 interferons can enhance natural killer (NK)-cell cytotoxicity, enhance the expression of major histocompatibility complex \u2160 proteins, as well as promote IFN production and the proliferation of NK cells and macrophages (De Andrea et al., 2002, Goodbourn et al., 2000, Sen, 2001). IFN-\u03b1 in conjunction with corticosteroids were shown to improve oxygen saturation and facilitate more rapid resolution of radiographic lung abnormalities in SARS infection (Loutfy et al., 2003). A study using a MERS-CoV infection mouse model indicated that early application of exogenous IFN-\u03b2 facilitated virus clearance and protected against fatal lung infection, while delayed IFN-\u03b2 administration tended to elevate damaging proinflammatory cytokine responses and led to deleterious outcomes (Channappanavar et al., 2019). Given the inconclusive effects of IFNs in treating viral infectious diseases, IFNs and combined therapy should be prudently employed with COVID-19 infection (Table 1).",

IVIG demonstrates its passive immunity and anti-inflammatory effects by supplying idiotypic antibodies (Kaveri et al., 1991), binding to Fc receptors (Fehr et al., 1982), suppressing pathogenic cytokines (Andersson and Andersson, 1990, Andersson et al., 1993), preventing formation of membranolytic attack complexes (Lutz et al., 1996), and modulating T-cell function (Fig. 3) (Marchalonis et al., 1992). Transchromosomic bovine-produced human polyclonal immunoglobulin G antibodies inhibited MERS-CoV in murine models and in vitro assays (Luke et al., 2016). Due to the scarcity of human-derived IgG products (or convalescent plasma), therapeutic immunoglobulin might provide insights for COVID-19 treatment (Table 1). However, IVIG should be carefully administered given its numerous adverse effects (e.g., myalgia, fever, renal failure (Achiron, 1997, Bertorini et al., 1996, Wajanaponsan and Cheng, 2004), and venous thromboembolism (Hoffmann and Enk, 2019). Thromboembolism was found in a third of patients with SARS who underwent IVIG treatment during the SARS outbreak in Singapore (Lew et al., 2003).",

NK cells can elicit rapid and robust protective effects in defense against viral infections through direct cytotoxicity and immunomodulatory capability (Fig. 3) (Vivier et al., 2008). Once recognizing infected host cells, NK cells trigger targeted cell apoptosis by perforin- and granzyme B-mediated pathways and secrete multiple cytokines involved in regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses, which facilitate viral clearance (Iannello et al., 2008). NK cell-based immunotherapies have long been investigated for treating malignancies, albeit with limited clinical practice due to the difficulty to obtain sufficient cell numbers for adoptive transfer (Lee, 2019). Recently, CYNK-001, an investigational allogeneic NK cell therapy derived from placental hematopoietic stem cells, has passed through an investigational new drug application approved by FDA (Celularity, 2020). As a NK cell product, CYNK-001 harbors the potential for inhibiting viral infection through direct killing SARS-CoV-2 infected host cells and indirect inducing immune responses. However, there exists controversy about whether the elicited strong inflammatory responses are favorable or detrimental for patients infected with severe COVID-19. The efficacy and safety of NK cell therapy for COVID-19 require to be tested by ongoing related clinical trials.",

Despite the long history of administering corticosteroids, their therapeutic effectiveness and safety remain controversial. Several clinical trials and meta-analyses have indicated that corticosteroids are associated with increased mortality, a tendency for requiring mechanical ventilation therapy, and relatively longer hospitalizations for SARS, MERS, and H1N1 infections (Arabi et al., 2018, Han et al., 2011, Stockman et al., 2006). These adverse events are partly due to the suppression of normal host immune responses and impeded viral clearance. Numerous studies have, however, demonstrated corticosteroids\u2019 beneficial effects on physiologic outcomes in virus-associated respiratory diseases, supporting the proper application of corticosteroids in these cases, especially critical cases (Li et al., 2017, Siemieniuk et al., 2015). A retrospective study of 401 patients with SARS showed that corticosteroids reduced case fatality rates and shorten hospital stays (Chen et al., 2006). An accurate conclusion regarding the therapeutic effect of corticosteroids in treating COVID-19 cannot therefore be drawn (Table 1). High corticosteroid doses are closely associated with adverse events such as secondary infections, delayed viral clearance, and emergence of viral resistance. According to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID19 (7th edition) in China (NHPFC, 2020), however, prudent low-to-moderate doses of corticosteroids could yield potential therapeutic benefits for a subset of seriously ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, recommendations in line with the interim clinical management guidance for COVID-19 released by the World Health Organization, which advised against routinely administering corticosteroids except for clinical indications such as exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and septic shock (WHO, 2020b).",

There was no difference on 28-day mortality between heparin users and nonusers. However, the 28-day mortality of heparin users was lower than nonusers. This study suggests that anticoagulant therapy with heparin appears to be associated with better prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients (Tang et al., 2020b). Interestingly, patients with severe pneumonia by COVID-19 had higher platelet count than those induced non-COVID-19, and only the former with markedly elevated D-dimer may benefit from anticoagulant therapy (Yin et al., 2020). Future study using a large sample size is needed to confirm the effects of heparin in the management of COVID-19 patients.",

Vitamin C exerts positive effects on the immune system by stimulating IFN production, supporting lymphocyte proliferation, and boosting neutrophil phagocytic capability (Fig. 3) (May and Harrison, 2013, Oudemans-van Straaten et al., 2014, Wilson, 2013). In acute lung injury and ARDS, excessive neutrophil accumulation in inflammatory loci results in lung tissue damage through the release of necrotic cell contents (known as neutrophil extracellular traps) (Papayannopoulos, 2018, Weiss, 1989), and vitamin C is reported to prevent this process (Mohammed et al., 2013). In animal models of sepsis, vitamin C was shown to protect lung barrier function and reduce lung vascular injury through diminishing inflammatory responses and coagulant changes (Fisher et al., 2012, Fisher et al., 2011). A phase \u2160 trial in patients with critically severe sepsis reported that high doses of vitamin C reduced the extent of multiple organ failure and mitigated circulating injury biomarker levels (Fowler et al., 2014). Placebo-controlled trials have shown that vitamin C could reduce the duration of colds (Hemil\u00e4 and Chalker, 2013). Given that COVID-19 patients frequently present lung damage, vitamin C could be a promising candidate (Table 1).",

To meet the urgent need for an effective vaccine in the context of active SARS-CoV-2 transmission, companies and institutions worldwide have been working on a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine through various approaches, resulting in a series of vaccine candidates (Routley, 2020). One of the most promising one of them is mRNA-1273, which is developed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease scientists together with biotechnology company Moderna (Fig. 3) (Moderna, 2020a; NIH, 2020). As an mRNA vaccine, mRNA-1273 embedded in lipid nanoparticles encodes viral S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and then delivers the antigen into human cells to elicit SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies and potent immune responses, thereby protecting healthy individuals against COVID-19 infection (Fig. 3). mRNA vaccine is superior to other conventional vaccines, given its high potency, short production cycles and safety as lack of actual viral genome (Ahn et al., 2020). A phase \u2160, open-label, dose-ranging trial of mRNA-1273 was conducted in 45 healthy adult volunteers aged 18 to 55 years with three different doses of mRNA-1273 to assess its efficacy and appropriate effective dose (Table 1) (NCT04283461). On April 16, 2020, Moderna received the award from US Government Agency BRADA for up to $483 million to accelerate development of mRNA-1273 against COVID-19 (Moderna, 2020b).",

According to Cansino, preclinical data in animal models demonstrated that Ad5-nCoV can elicit robust immune responses and a favorable safety profile (Mak, 2020).

PittCoVacc is delivered with a novel technique known as microneedle array, a fingertip-sized patch of 400 tiny needles. This strategy can elicit more potent immune responses than conventional subcutaneous needle injection and has been demonstrated to be sufficiently safe. PittCoVacc has been tested immunogenicity in mice with the emergence of substantial SARS-CoV-2 antibodies within 2 weeks after prime immunization. The research team hoped to test PittCoVacc in humans in clinical trials in the next few months (Table 1) (ScienceDaily, 2020).",

Subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) are synthesized by discontinuous transcription from the (+)gRNA template and then encode viral structural and accessary proteins, which are subsequently assembled with newly synthesized viral RNA to form new virions. The nascent virions are then transported in secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane and released by exocytosis. RhACE2, convalescent plasma and JAK inhibitor baricitinib could dampen the binding of the Spike protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 expressed on the cell surface. Lopinavir/ritonavir and favipiravir inhibit the proteolysis of polypeptide chains. Remdesivir inhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. EIDD-2801 could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. NO and Zinc might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Vitamin D might induce antimicrobial peptides to reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication. Ivermectin could effectively block SARS-CoV-2 growth. Baricitinib could interrupt the passage of SARS-CoV-2 entering cells through inhibition of AAK1-mediated endocytosis. CQ and HCQ inhibit virus/cell fusion process. LHQW and IFNs could block the process of virus replication (RNAs transcription, protein translation, and post-translational modification).

            "text": "Fig. 3: The hypothetical mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytokine storm and antiviral immunity and the possible therapeutic targets of patients with COVID-19 infection. \u201cCytokine storms\u201d might start with inflammatory cytokine secretion into lung tissue and pulmonary blood vessels from virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells, pulmonary vascular endothelial cells, alveolar macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and other infiltrated immune cells, which mainly serve to limit the replication and spreading of the virus and to induce downstream immune responses via the blood circulation. Following the recruitment and activation by primary cytokines, systemic immune cells (neutrophils, DCs, Mo-M\u03c6, NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, Th1 cells, Th2 cells, and Th17 cells, etc.) further secrete inflammatory cytokines and promote the cascade of inflammatory processes to eliminate virus and virus-infected cells. Vitamin C might inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and alleviate the illness by decreasing inflammatory cytokines, stimulating IFN production, supporting lymphocyte proliferation, boosting the phagocytic capability of neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, protecting lung barrier function and reducing lung vascular injury, increasing IFN secretion from alveolar M\u03c6, Mo-M\u03c6, DCs, NK cells, and CD8+ T cells. IFNs could enhance NK cell cytotoxicity, enhance expression of major histocompatibility complex \u2160 proteins, and promote the production of IFNs and the proliferation of NK cells and M\u03c6. Bevacizumab could reduce vascular permeability. Vaccines (mRNA1273, Ad5-nCoV, PittCoVacc, and NVX-CoV2373) could induce protective antiviral immune memory, while MSCs could decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines, promote regeneration, secrete multiple paracrine factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and enlarge the proportion of Treg cells. iNO could alleviate pulmonary hypertension through its selective pulmonary vasodilation. Corticosteroids, LHQW, Xuebijing, IVIG, tocilizumab, sarilumab, baricitinib, vitamin D, CQ, and HCQ could also reduce inflammation. Heparin blocks the thrombus formation.
