RNA virus polyproteins that include replicative proteins are often processed autocatalytically, although in some virus groups cellular proteinases are also involved. In this manner, the expression of the non-structural proteins (or \u201creplicase\u201d complex) can be regulated in time and space, e.g. to produce alternative cleavage products or stable processing intermediates with unique functions (de Groot et al., 1990, Jore et al., 1988, Lemm et al., 1994, Ypma-Wong et al., 1988).",

            "text": "Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is the prototype of the arterivirus family and has a genome of approximately 12.7 kb, of which the 5\u2032-proximal three quarters contain the replicase gene. The 3\u2032-proximal region of the genome includes seven open reading frames encoding the viral structural proteins, which are expressed from a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs (de Vries et al., 1990, Snijder and Meulenberg, 2001). Replicase gene expression ultimately yields (at least) 12 non-structural proteins (Fig. 1A; Snijder et al., 1994, van Dinten et al., 1996, Wassenaar et al., 1997), which are produced from two primary genome translation products, the large polyproteins pp1a (1728 amino acids) and pp1ab (3175 amino acids), with the latter being expressed following a ribosomal frameshifting event (den Boon et al., 1991). The replicase subunits are released from the polyproteins by three virus-encoded proteinases (Fig. 1), of which the one located in nsp4 is responsible for the processing of the polypeptides that remain after nsp1 and nsp2 have been autocatalytically released from pp1a and pp1ab (Snijder et al., 1992, Snijder et al., 1994, Snijder et al., 1995, Snijder et al., 1996, van Dinten et al., 1999, Wassenaar et al., 1997). Since nsp4 controls the production of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and RNA helicase, it has been termed the EAV \u201cmain proteinase\u201d (Gorbalenya et al., 1991, Ziebuhr et al., 2000).",

The arterivirus proteinase combines the catalytic triad His/Asp/Ser of canonical chymotrypsin-like proteinases with the substrate specificity of the 3C-like cysteine proteinases, a subgroup of chymotrypsin-like enzymes named after the picornavirus 3C proteinases. In the cleaved, 204-residue EAV nsp4 (which equals Gly-1065 to Glu-1268 of the EAV replicase polyproteins) the catalytic triad is formed by His-39, Asp-65, and Ser-120. Cleavage sites recognized by the nsp4 proteinase carry a Glu at the P 1 position (Gln in one case) and a small amino acid (Gly, Ser, Ala) at the P 1\u2032 position (using the cleavage site nomenclature of Schechter and Berger, 1967). Furthermore, nsp4 possesses a unique C-terminal domain (CTD) extension of unknown function, which is not found in most other chymotrypsin-like proteinases and might be involved in modulation of nsp4 activity (Barrette-Ng et al., 2002).",

Briefly, after induction of expression, large amounts of MBP-nsp4 fusion protein were recovered from the soluble S100 fraction (Fig. 2A) and purification of the protein using an amylose resin affinity column yielded a more than 90% pure fusion protein (as judged from Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 stained protein gels). To prevent exposure of the nsp4 proteinase to relatively high temperatures, the release of nsp4 from the MBP moiety by cleavage with thrombin was not performed at the recommended temperature of 25 \u00b0C, but at 4 \u00b0C. An overnight digestion with 1 unit thrombin per mg of fusion protein was sufficient to cleave virtually all of the fusion protein (Fig. 2A). Nsp4 was further purified by anion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and repeated loading of the nsp4-containing samples onto an amylose resin affinity column to remove all remaining traces of MBP. Due to the cloning strategy, nsp4 lacked the C-terminal Glu-204 residue (nsp4 numbering) and carried three additional amino acids at its extreme C-terminus (Leu\u2013Ala\u2013Ser). After cleavage by thrombin, also the N-terminus of the proteinase remained attached to three foreign residues (Gly\u2013Ser\u2013Met) (Fig. 2C). Although mass spectrometry indicated that the purified nsp4 sample was homogeneous and of the expected molecular mass, there were two bands visible on the gel (Fig. 2A), which were both recognized by a nsp4-specific antiserum (data not shown). It has been reported before that nsp4, with a predicted molecular mass of 21 kDa, migrates as a 30 kDa protein (Snijder et al., 1996). Presumably, nsp4 is prone to aberrant migration during SDS-PAGE. Nevertheless, the recombinant protein obtained using this protocol was of sufficient purity and homogeneity to be successfully used for crystallogenesis and the subsequent nsp4 structure determination by X-ray crystallography (Barrette-Ng et al., 2002).",

However, some adjustments had to be made regarding the induction of protein expression. When an overnight liquid culture of pET-nsp4His-transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) bacteria was used to inoculate a larger culture, induction of protein expression with IPTG was, for unknown reasons, not successful. However, nsp4His synthesis could be induced in cultures grown for shorter periods of time or in colonies picked from freshly transformed plates. Therefore, instead of using an overnight liquid culture as an inoculum, a droplet from a 3 h culture was plated on a LBA plate, which was incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C, sliced into small pieces, and then added to LBA-containing flasks. With this method large cultures could be grown to the right density in a short period of time. After harvesting, lysis, and centrifugation of the cells, the S100 fraction was loaded on a column packed with Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech) charged with cobalt ions and the column was washed extensively with several buffers (see Section 2) to remove contaminating proteins. After the elution of Nsp4His from the column, the protein was more than 90% pure, as judged from a Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 stained SDS-PAGE gel, and generally a yield of 15 mg of nsp4His protein per 1-l culture was obtained (Fig. 2B). Active site mutant nsp4His-S120I was purified using the same protocols and yielded comparable quantities of protein. With this expression- and purification protocol, nsp4His could be purified within 8 h, whereas the MBP-nsp4 expression, cleavage and purification protocol would generally take 2 days. The differences between the amino acid sequences at the N- and C-termini of both expression products, and their comparison to the termini of native EAV nsp4, are depicted in Fig. 2C.",

Substrates represented EAV nsp6\u20137 and nsp6\u20138, which are naturally occurring processing intermediates of the minor processing pathway (Wassenaar et al., 1997). Aliquots from in vitro translation reactions were incubated with purified recombinant nsp4His or nsp4His-S120I. Samples were taken at 0, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after addition of proteinase and analyzed on 15% tricine SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 3\n). Processing of the two substrates could be easily monitored since cleavage of the nsp6/7, nsp7/8 or both sites resulted in a substrate size reduction of 2.3, 5.5, or 7.8 kDa, respectively. Fig. 3 illustrates that after a 15-min incubation with nsp4His about half of the nsp6\u20137 substrate had been processed, although the remaining substrate was processed much slower. Similar results regarding the processing of the nsp6/7 site were obtained with the nsp6\u20138 substrate, but the second cleavage site in this substrate (the nsp7/8 site) was processed much faster. Already after 15 min, almost no nsp6\u20138 or nsp7\u20138 could be detected, suggesting that the nsp7/8 site had been cleaved in all of the available substrates (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, processing of each of the substrates produced several additional products (indicated with arrows in Fig. 3). These were not observed after incubation with the inactive control enzyme nsp4His-S120I or when the reaction was performed without enzyme, suggesting that the generation of these products depended on the proteolytic activity of nsp4His. Based on their sizes, these products may have been derived from internal cleavage of nsp7, a possibility that is currently being investigated in more detail.",

In the initial experiment, 10 \u03bcg of each peptide (final concentration approximately 100 \u03bcM) was incubated at 25 \u00b0C with 37.5 \u03bcg of either nsp4His or nsp4His-S120I (both at a concentration of 18 \u03bcM), or without nsp4 proteinase, in a 100-\u03bcl volume of a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA. Samples were taken directly after addition of nsp4 (t\n = 0 h) or after 3- and 6-h incubations and were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC. As an example, the results for peptide 222-36, representing the nsp7/8 cleavage site, are shown in Fig. 4\n. Following incubation with nsp4His, the main peak representing the uncleaved peptide was reduced and the peptide was apparently converted into two new products. Incubation with nsp4His-S120I or an assay without nsp4His did not yield these two new peaks, indicating that they were derived from nsp4His activity. When mass spectrometry was used to analyze the two newly formed products, it was found that the peaks with retention times of 8 and 9.7 min (Fig. 4) were of the same mass as the C-terminal and N-terminal fragments of the peptide, respectively, assuming cleavage at the Glu/Gly bond representing the established EAV nsp4 cleavage site in this substrate. All peptides could be cleaved under the selected conditions (approximately 25% hydrolysis after 6 h) without obvious differences between the peptides being detected (data not shown). The peptide representing the nsp7/8 cleavage site was selected to further optimize reaction conditions because of its slightly higher cleavage potential.",

Therefore, to investigate whether a differently purified nsp4 proteinase might perform better, the catalytic activity of nsp4His proteinase was compared to that of a partially purified MBP-nsp4 proteinase. The MBP-nsp4 protein was not further purified after the thrombin cleavage step, but instead the cleaved fusion protein sample was directly used in the peptide cleavage assay. A similar experimental set-up using HCV 229E 3CLpro had shown that such a limited purification did not negatively affect the ability of the proteinase to cleave peptides (Ziebuhr et al., 1995). However, the enzymatic properties of the partially purified EAV MBP-nsp4 were not different from those of the (His)6 tagged nsp4 proteinase (data not shown), suggesting that the low catalytic activity had a different cause. The possibility of inhibition of the proteinase by contaminants or instability of the enzyme after storage was investigated by an additional wash on the column with 60% isopropanol (Franken et al., 2000) or by using the purified protein directly in the assay instead of after storage at 4 \u00b0C or \u221280 \u00b0C. However, the additional washing step did not increase catalytic activity and no differences were found between a freshly prepared sample and preparations stored at 4 \u00b0C for 3 days or stored at \u221280 \u00b0C for 2 weeks. This indicated that catalytic activity was not lost during storage, but was already low upon isolation of the enzyme, possibly due to the purification method and/or intrinsic properties of nsp4. Alternatively, the parameters of the in vitro cleavage reaction might have been suboptimal. To address the latter possibility, the catalytic activity of nsp4His was compared at different temperatures (20, 25, 30 and 37 \u00b0C) using the starting buffer composition (20 mM Tris pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). Although hydrolysis of the peptide turned out to be slightly faster at 37 \u00b0C, the differences in comparison to the other temperatures were marginal (data not shown).",

The pH range tested included 6 (25 mM MES), 7 (25 mM MOPS), 8 (25 mM Tris), and 9 (25 mM glycine) and these pH values were combined with NaCl concentrations of 25, 500, and 1000 mM and glycerol concentrations of 10, 20, and 30%. After a 4-h incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 \u03bcl of 10% trichloroacitic acid and samples were analyzed using reversed-phase HPLC. Since the peak with a retention time of 8 min, representing the C-terminal part of the peptide, had a very low absorbance at 215 nm, only the peak with a retention time of 9.7 min (Fig. 4) was quantified by integration. Samples could not be quantified when less than 3% of the substrate was cleaved. Although differences in catalytic activity were observed using the different buffers, no significant improvements were found compared to the starting reaction conditions in which 15% of the substrate was cleaved during a 4-h incubation at 37 \u00b0C. In the pH 6 buffer and at NaCl concentrations of 500 and 1000 mM, the catalytic activity of nsp4 was even below detection limit. No significant differences were found between reactions performed at pH 7, 8, or 9, but catalytic activity seemed slightly enhanced by increasing the concentration of glycerol (data not shown). Since high NaCl concentrations inhibited nsp4His activity, cleavage conditions were further optimized by titrating the NaCl concentration with 50-mM increments between 0 and 500 mM at a pH of 7.5 (25 mM MOPS) and a glycerol concentration of 10%. Although the catalytic activity was slightly higher at glycerol concentrations of 30%, a lower concentration was chosen for technical reasons. However, increasing the NaCl concentration above 25 mM only reduced the catalytic activity in the assay (data not shown). Finally, the effect of the presence of 10 mM DTT and 2.5 mM EDTA on catalytic activity was investigated, but addition of these compounds did not make a detectable difference (data not shown).",

Although this was not a quantitative assay, the EAV nsp4 proteinase displayed kinetics that were comparable to those of other 3C-like proteinases in similar experiments (Grubman et al., 1995, Thole and Hull, 2002, Tibbles et al., 1996, Tibbles et al., 1999, Ziebuhr et al., 1995). The unexpected small reaction products visible in Fig. 3, at first suggested aberrant nsp4 activity or additional cleavages by other proteinases in the system, possibly following activation by nsp4. However, re-examination of protein gels from several previous independent experiments, in which we used pp1a expression systems and EAV-infected cells to investigate nsp4 activity confirmed the existence of minor bands of approximately the same size as the unidentified bands in Fig. 3, making it more plausible that these bands were derived from genuine nsp4 activity.

Also, the in vivo trans-cleavage activity of nsp4His, as determined using the recombinant vaccinia virus/T7 expression system (data not shown), was comparable to that of untagged nsp4, suggesting that the presence of the (His)6 tag did not affect nsp4 proteolytic activity.",

            "text": "Although the processing kinetics of in vitro synthesized substrates by nsp4His seemed comparable to that of, e.g. the distantly related human coronavirus 229E 3CLpro in an identical experimental set-up, this was not true for the synthetic peptide cleavage assays. Despite our efforts to improve the performance of the enzyme by testing a variety of reaction conditions, nsp4 was unable to cleave more than 15% of its substrate during a 4-h incubation, whereas studies using the human coronavirus 229E and SARS-coronavirus 3CLpro enzymes reported complete conversion of a comparable amount of substrate in less than 2 h, using a 10-fold lower enzyme concentration compared to that used in our nsp4 experiments (Shi et al., 2004, Ziebuhr et al., 1997). A possible explanation for this discrepancy is the lack of nsp2 in our assay, which was suggested to act as nsp4 cofactor in the polyprotein processing via the major pathway in vivo (Wassenaar et al., 1997). In the Flaviviridae family, the NS4A cofactor (Hepatitis C virus) and the NS2B cofactor (Dengue virus type 2) have been shown to enhance in vitro NS3 proteinase activity up to 100-fold (Steinkuhler et al., 1996, Yusof et al., 2000). Yet another explanation may be found in the observations made during the crystallographic studies of nsp4 of Barrette-Ng et al. (2002), who reported that three out of four copies of nsp4 in the unit cell had a collapsed oxyanion hole, which would render the proteinase practically inactive. If the majority of the purified nsp4His and MBP-nsp4 molecules would have had such a collapsed oxyanion hole, this might explain the low activity of both proteinases. Possibly this is a consequence of nsp4 expression in E. coli, since both forms of the proteinase (MBP-nsp4 and nsp4His) displayed low proteolytic activity. Expression in a different system (e.g. insect cells or yeast) might give better results. Also, we cannot rule out that the foreign amino acid residues present at either the N- or C-terminus of the recombinant nsp4 might have inhibited its proteolytic activity. In coronavirus main proteinases, the N-terminus was found to be of critical importance to the geometry of in particular the S1 subsite, suggesting that changes (or extensions) in this part of the protein may adversely influence proteolytic activity (Anand et al., 2002). If this property is shared with the distantly related arterivirus main proteinase, this might explain the finding of the collapsed oxyanion hole (Barrette-Ng et al., 2002) in the majority of the molecules. Although it seemed that either only a small part of the purified nsp4 was proteolytically active or that the catalytic activity of the enzyme was low, the cleavage of cognate sites in both assays confirmed the specificity of the E. coli-derived nsp4 proteinase. Thus, the work described in this study may lay the groundwork for the more extensive biochemical characterization of the EAV main proteinase, including studies aiming to identify inhibitors of proteolytic activity.",

Alternatively, in the absence of nsp2, the nsp5/6 and nsp6/7 sites are processed and the nsp4/5 junction remains uncleaved (minor pathway). The status of the small nsp6 subunit (fully cleaved or partially associated with nsp5 and/or nsp7) remains to be elucidated. Adapted from Barrette-Ng et al., 2002.",

Lanes 1 and 2 show samples of total lysates from non-induced (lane 1) and IPTG-induced (lane 2) cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pMalTnsp4. After cell lysis and ultracentrifugation (100,000 \u00d7 g) the S100 fraction (lane 3) was loaded on an amylose affinity column and bound protein was eluted with buffer A supplemented with 10 mM maltose (lane 4). After an overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C with 1 unit of thrombin per mg of MBP-nsp4 (lane 5), cleaved nsp4 was further purified by gel filtration (Sephadex G-75), anion exchange chromatography, and repeated loading of the sample on an amylose column until a purity of more than 90% was reached (lane 6). Although mass-spectrometry indicated that the purified nsp4 was homogeneous, the sample migrated as a double band, a repeatedly observed phenomenon with nsp4. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, which was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. (B) Expression and purification of nsp4His. Samples were total lysates from non-induced (lane 1) and IPTG-induced (lane 2) cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pET-nsp4His or fractions made during purification (lanes 3\u20136). After cell lysis and ultracentrifugation, the S100 fraction was loaded on a Talon affinity column (Clontech) charged with cobalt chloride. Samples were taken from the flow-through (lane 3), after washing the column with buffer D (lane 4), and with buffer D supplemented with 10 mM imidazole (lane 5). The bound nsp4His was eluted from the column with buffer E (lane 6). For buffer composition see Section 2. As judged from the gel, the purity of the sample was more than 90%. (C) Nucleotide- and amino acid sequences corresponding to the termini of the nsp4 gene in the MBP-nsp4 and nsp4His expression constructs. Foreign amino acids are shown in bold face and indicated with \u201cn\u201d or \u201cc\u201d. The top panel shows N- and C-termini of wild-type nsp4, which is produced from the EAV replicase polyproteins by autoproteolysis of the nsp3/4 and nsp4/5 sites (indicated with \u2193). Both pp1a and nsp4 amino acid numbers are given. The middle panel shows the MBP-nsp4 fusion protein. After cleavage by thrombin, compared to native EAV nsp4, three foreign amino acids (Gly\u2013Ser\u2013Met) remain at the N-terminus. The amino acid sequence recognized by thrombin is underlined and the position of the thrombin cleavage site is indicated (\u2193). At the C-terminus of MBP-nsp4, due to the cloning strategy, the native Glu-204 was replaced by a Leu residue and two additional amino acids were introduced (Ala\u2013Ser). The bottom panel shows the nsp4His protein. A translation initiation codon was added, resulting in an N-terminal foreign Met residue upstream of the native P 1\u2032 Gly residue. At the C-terminus of nsp4His, the native Glu-204 was replaced by a Gly residue, which is followed by the (His)6 tag.",

After a 90-min incubation at 30 \u00b0C, transcription and translation were stopped (for details see Section 2).
