We sampled for initial burden, established a baseline from five samples over 71 days, and measured post-intervention microbial burden over seven samples (56 days) from October 2019 to March 2020. After baseline, 20 hardware sites were changed to commercially available antimicrobial silver fixtures, and 12 sites remained as controls. Prior to initiating the study, all surfaces were cleaned routinely (about weekly) with commercial cleaning agents. During the study, each site was cleaned after each sampling using a commercial benzethonium chloride wipe (a quaternary amine). Swabs were placed in collectors of 1 mL room-temperature Letheen broth and a research microbiology laboratory measured total aerobic heterotrophic bacteria in samples by plating on modified tryptic soy agar with 5% sheep blood and incubated for 48 hours at 37 \u00b0C. Direct colony counts were made and those with substantial clearing were counted as hemolytic colony forming units (CFUs). CFU counts, indicating total microbial contamination,9 were converted to their natural logarithms for data analysis because the raw counts had a non-normal distribution.",

A paired t test for the Ag group showed significantly higher mean microbial burden with a medium effect size at post-test (t = \u20132.58, 19 df, P < 0.02; Cohen d = 0.69), and a similar result for hemolytic counts (t = \u20133.10, 19 df, P < 0.01; Cohen d = 0.92). The control group mean pre- and post-comparisons were not significantly different (t = \u20130.238 and \u20130.132, P < 0.82 and 0.89, respectively). Analysis of raw counts across all sites using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs sign test found a significant difference with a medium effect size for the Ag group (P < 0.04, d = 0.57), and no meaningful difference for the control sites. In short, unexpectedly we found Ag touch surfaces associated with higher microbial burdens compared with the existing pre-intervention hardware.",

The influence of local influenza rate may be relevant. We found that our local and regional ILI rates reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) differed significantly from our baseline to post-change out period (t = 2.573, df 11, P < 0.03; d = 1.44). Thus, we examined point-biserial correlations between CFU and hemolytic counts with pre- versus post-Ag change status over 13 time samplings and found correlations of r = 0.515 and 0.455, respectively. The suggestively higher values for the post-change out period were not significant at P < 0.05 (N = 13). Removing variance associated with both regional and local ILI rates by partial correlation for the log CFU values yielded an r = 0.682 (not significantly different from r = 0.515). However, the partial correlation for log hemolytic counts was significantly different (r = 0.075 vs r = 0.455; z = P < 0.02). Thus, ILI rates did not materially affect the observed rise in CFU for the Ag sites, but the hemolytic count increase could be related to a covariate of elevated local rates of influenza.",

Regardless, our results suggest this brand of commercial Ag hardware does not substantially reduce total microbial burden. Importantly, we observed the first time sampling (reflecting prior cleaning practices) yielded elevated counts for both total CFU and hemolytic bacteria relative to subsequent baseline time samplings (both t = 3.58, df 31, P < 0.001; Cohen d = 0.49 and 0.57).
