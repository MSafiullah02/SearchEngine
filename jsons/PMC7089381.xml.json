The comprehensive distribution of ROS may grant them with a fundamental role in biosystem. Although ROS play an important role in pathogen resistance and cellular signalling, they are also broadly recognized as harmful reactive particles to cell as they damage intracellular proteins, lipids and nucleic acids. It usually appears in pathological processes when they are not scavenged on time [2]. The essence that ROS are produced in energy demanding conditions where vigorous metabolism is in demand shall not be neglected. The pathogenic role of ROS in self-damage and the beneficial role in the immune system may be due to the requirement of energy supply. In these conditions, excessively produced ROS bring about oxidative damage to body and pathogens. ROS are widely involved in basic mechanisms and pathways. They not only impair cells and tissues with oxidative damage, but also play an important role in many homeostasis processes involving metabolism, immunity, growth and differentiation [3]. Researchers have been regarding ROS as byproducts and exploring their effects on organisms, but the fundamental features of ROS might illuminate their role in pathologies and biomechanisms.",

Succinate is the intermediate of TCA cycle and also a metabolic signature of ischaemia\u2013reperfusion. It is responsible for ROS generation when accumulated from fumarate overproduction and malate/aspartate shuttle during reperfusion. Ischaemia injury can be ameliorated by the inhibition of succinate or ROS. Complex II turns succinate into fumarate through oxidation in mitochondria with reduced ubiquinone in the membrane [8], and succinate could be re-oxidized by SDH, thus increasing ROS generation through reverse electron transport in mitochondria.

The received reducing equivalents are proceeded with ubiquinol and produces semiquinone for further proton transfer. p66SHC (Src homologous\u2013collagen homologue adaptor protein) generates mitochondrial ROS as apoptosis signal through oxidation of cytochrome c in mitochondrial electron transfer chain. p66 mutants could lose the ability to generate ROS and induce mitochondrial apoptosis [10], but genetic mutation may also contribute to increased generation of ROS. Isp-1 and nuo-6 encode complex III subunit Rieske and complex I subunit NDUFB4 (NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] 1 beta subcomplex subunit 4), respectively. Mutants in isp-1 and nuo-6 are all related with enhanced ROS level that leads to lengthened lifespan. ROS promotor treatments can lengthen the wild-type lifespan while having no effect on those longevity mutants. And the enhanced ROS induces apoptosis pathway triggered by CED-13 that changed the gene expression to protect mitochondrial dysfunction [11]. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1 ) could regulate cell proliferation and death, and the inhibition of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB) makes TNF\u03b1 bias to cell death. TNF\u03b1-induced ROS could support c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation during NF-\u03baB inhibition. The sustained JNK activation enables cytochrome c release and leads to necrotic cell death [12].",

The mechanisms to survive under such environment are essential for body cells or tumour cells and bacteria. Hypoxia inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2\u03b1 ) encoded by endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (Epas1) gene could control ROS level in mitochondria through antioxidant enzymes and maintain ROS homeostasis [14]. PPAR\u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) is required for antioxidative enzymes including glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) [15]. ROS level also could be controlled through degradation of NOX2 on endoplasmic reticulum by protein negative regulator of ROS (NRROS). This reduces tissue damage and maintains its function upon immunological defence [16, 17]. However, ROS themselves could activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) by targeting proteins G\u03b1i and G\u03b10 and protect cardiac cell from oxidative damage [18]. These proteins present protective effect on body cells and redox balance. It is also noted that the opened potassium channels may reduce ROS level [19].",

Cancer cells could produce enough NADPH to support vigorous proliferation while maintaining ROS homeostasis through GSH (glutathione). Enhanced ROS in lung cancer cells could inhibit glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). This also allows them to survive under acute oxidative stress and still supports their proliferation [20]. Nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) transcription is increased in tumour cells to suppress ROS generation by Nrf2\u2013Keap1 (kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1) interaction. Oncogenic alleles of K-Ras, B-Raf and Myc could increase Nrf2 antioxidant activity and reduce ROS level [21]. Researches also indicate that gene Ucp2 (uncoupling protein 2) could limit ROS production and inflammation in macrophage [22]. Apart from that, antioxidants also include organics like Vitamin E, Vitamin C and complexes like FHC (ferritin heavy chain). They reduce apoptosis induced by TNF\u03b1 and JNK activity through suppression of ROS accumulation and iron sequestration as a downstream product of NF-\u03baB pathway [23, 24].",

It also makes them suffer less DNA damage from radiation with enhanced ROS scavenging systems [31]. Cancer cells resistant to BRAF and MEK inhibitors develop vulnerability to high levels of ROS [32]. Thus, the strategy to enhance ROS level may seem to present as an important way for cancer chemotherapy.",

The mutation causes deficiency in respiratory complex I and ended up in overproduction of ROS, and the metastatic activity could be suppressed with ROS scavenger [7]. Increased ROS generation could trigger enhanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling and promote tumour progression [33]. Snail and EMT stimulated by MMP-3 could increase ROS generation. The elevated ROS level could turn normal cells into cancer cells with DNA damage and genomic variation. [26]. ROS could also mediate the tumour microenvironment through epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition that contributes to radioresistance and therapeutic failure [34]. Although suppressing ROS signalling to inhibit tumour growth with ROS scavenger is not ideal, the process of inhibition impairs ROS-mediated oxidative damage and apoptosis [35]. The uninhibited ROS generation and uncontrolled ROS level could also promote cancer cell metastasis and the process of canceration.",

Rather than focusing on symptoms, the fundamental role of ROS and its comprehensive distribution among biosystem may explain these competing results from a broader perspective. ROS are highly related with energy production rather than just byproducts. Cancer development and tumour metastasis demand larger amounts of energy than normal cells. This energy-acquiring process also produces high levels of ROS. The enhancement of ROS may also increase energy production to facilitate tumourigenesis. Rather than a regulator of the cancer pathology, ROS are more likely the representative of energy consumption. It is easy to induce cancer cells death in vitro with oxidative damage. However, the failure to apply oxidative damage to cancer cells clinically seems to be the result of ROS homeostasis system in vivo.",

ROS play a similar role in immunity by enhancing immunological defence and causing oxidative damage. NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome could enhance inflammation by activating caspase 1 and promoting secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. ROS are crucial for NLRP3 activation [36]. Drosophila multipotent haematopoietic progenitors present relatively high levels of ROS in in vivo physiological conditions and become low during differentiation. The enhanced ROS could promote the differentiation through JNK and the forkhead box O (FoxO) pathway, but ROS inhibition disabled its differentiation [37]. Although the differentiation prefers low levels of ROS, they are still essential for the process. Different T-cell subsets also have distinct sensitivity to ROS level that may influence their development and function. TH17 cells are involved in autoimmune diseases and inflammatory diseases. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a TH17-mediated autoimmune disease. Regulating TH17 cell differentiation by interfering ROS level through glutathione metabolism could prevent EAE development [38]. Influencing chromatin structure with GLS inhibition also enhances ROS level and prevents TH17 differentiation [39]. Discovery of brand new T-cell subsets also endows deeper understanding on immune system and provides aspects for the exploration of T-cell-regulated autoimmune diseases [40].",

Apart from oxidative damage, ROS also serve as signalling molecules and play an important role in homeostasis, metabolism, growth and differentiation [3]. Ucp2 could limit ROS production and inflammation in macrophage and reduce parasitic cysts [22]. However, Ucp1 relies on ROS level required for heat dissipation through thermogenic respiration in brown adipose tissues. The depletion of ROS inhibits Ucp1 and heat generation [46].

TNF-\u03b1 is indicated to contribute to ROS production in rheumatoid arthritis [49]. However, other studies indicate that ROS response during bacterial antibiotic killing is dispensable [50]. ROS scavenger and hydroxyl radical inhibitor could suppress antibiotic bacterial killing. Antibiotic bacterial killing does not strictly depend on ROS [51]. It is also noted that the level of ROS does not influence antibiotics\u2019 activity on killing bacteria at all [52]. Antibiotic killing of Escherichia coli does not rely on ROS [53]. The enhanced bacterial killing with increased ROS level may due to increased metabolism and energy supply that support oxidation and immunity system.

The adipogenesis could also be influenced by ROS via signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) [55]. However, antioxidants could rescue the apoptosis [56]. FHC could suppress ROS accumulation and JNK activity through iron sequestration that inhibits TNF-\u03b1-dependent apoptosis [24]. PGC-1\u03b1 could protect neural cells from oxidative damage by reducing ROS level via antioxidative enzymes GPx1 and SOD2 [15]. Methylmercury and manganese could induce neurotoxicity with enhanced ROS level [57, 58]. And the increased level of ROS in the substantia nigra pars compacta leads to neuronal apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in Down syndrome and Parkinson\u2019s disease. This process may ultimately lead to retardation [59]. NRROS could protect central nervous system from EAE by reducing oxidative damage through NOX2 degradation on endoplasmic reticulum [17]. Nevertheless, ROS still play an important role in neuronal development and are essential for synaptic plasticity and memory formation with its fundamental role in energy perfusion. The essence that neurons are differentiated cells that lack the potential to proliferate explained these competing results of antioxidative strategies.

            "text": "In the heart, angiotensin II, norepinephrine and TNF-\u03b1 mediated ROS are related with cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial infarction and heart failure. Myocardial ischaemia is the most common cause of heart failure. The ischaemia\u2013reperfusion injury leads to apoptosis of cardiomyocytes that is associated with high levels of ROS [60]. The shortage of ATP during ischaemia impairs ion pump and causes calcium accumulation. Calcium overload and increased ROS could rupture plasma membrane and lead to cell death [61]. Cardiac hypertrophy is a compensating process that enables heart to maintain sufficient function. The increased ROS during the process is responsive to energy demand caused by insufficient heart function. Thioredoxin 1 could reduce cardiac hypertrophy through heat shock protein 40 and class II histone deacetylases, the latter being a master negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy [62]. And it is also noted that ROS increased via d-amino acid oxidase in the hearts of rats could directly lead to systolic heart failure without cardiac hypertrophy [63]. The oxidative damage-mediated apoptosis is the major cause of heart failure as well. The method to fulfil energy demand by using NOX4 to protect heart from failure with improved myocardial energetics via fatty acid oxidation is also proved to be successful [64]. To reduce oxidative damage, ubiA prenyltransferase domain-containing protein 1 presents cardiovascular protective function via antioxidant Coenzyme Q10 [65]. However, the inability to recover from cardiac damage and pathology is also critical for heart failure. Postnatal cardiomyocyte cell-cycle arrest is mediated by ROS through DNA damage response [66]. Heart cell stretch could cause arrhythmogenic Ca2+ sparks based on microtubules [7]. Although the oxidative damage caused by ROS is the major reason for heart failure, the role of ROS in energy supply is rather important that protect heart from an even sudden failure of insufficient function.",

Oxidative stress could lead to hypertension and promote its pathological process. However, ROS are also needed for the relaxation of cerebral arteries [67]. ETS-1 and angiotensin II-generated ROS play an important role in vascular changes and injury, and NO could regulate blood flow homeostasis in blood vessels [68]. These outcomes seem to be confusing to tell whether ROS are beneficial or harmful. The role of ROS in biosystem is rather neutral that they mainly respond to energy demand. NOX family could influence the neovascularity of tumour and physiological vascular processes [69]. Similar results also presented in ROS-mediated wound repair [70]. Ischaemia\u2013reperfusion (IR) causes oxidative damage with increased generation of ROS in mitochondria. Succinate is the metabolic signature of ischaemia and responsible for ROS generation during reperfusion. The reperfusion injury also leads to retinal dysfunction-associated ROS production when the blood pressure is low [71]. Succinate accumulates during reperfusion from fumarate overproduction and malate/aspartate shuttle and then re-oxidized by succinate dehydrogenase. This process increases ROS generation through reverse electron transport in mitochondria. The inhibition of succinate or ROS could ameliorate IR injury [9]. Pre-conditioning protocols could reduce ischaemia\u2013reperfusion injury by regulating ROS level [72].",

The ROS level leading to organ failures far exceeds the extent to maintain basic metabolism and thus the balance between energy supply and oxidative damage is tilted. Increasing ROS grants little beneficial effect in this situation. Inhibition of ROS could reduce TNF-\u03b1-mediated fulminant liver failure. TNF\u03b1 regulates cell proliferation and death and the inhibition of NF-\u03baB makes TNF\u03b1 bias to cell death. TNF\u03b1-induced ROS supports JNK activation during NF-\u03baB inhibition. Sustained JNK activation enables cytochrome c release and leads to necrotic cell death [12]. FHC is a downstream product of NF-\u03baB. They could reduce apoptosis induced by TNF\u03b1 through suppression of ROS accumulation and JNK activity. The suppression of ROS is achieved by iron sequestration [24]. ROS are produced by glomerular cells as autacoids [78]. ROS-mediated glomerular basement membrane degradation and altered cell function may contribute to ischaemic renal failure as well [79]. And the inhibition of ROS could decrease CaOx stone in kidney [80]. Hypoxia-induced requirement of energy supply and metabolism could lead to increased ROS response through Ca2+ influx pathway. This mechanism results in physiological, biochemical and molecular changes. The hypoxia-induced ROS production is important for respiratory plasticity and sensory plasticity. ROS-mediated apoptosis and cellular dysfunction are associated with heart failure [60]. The arrhythmias caused by elevated ROS and altered mitochondrial function may lead to sudden cardiac death [81].",

ROS promote macrophage bacterial killing through oxidative damage and apoptosis. They also engage in multiple cellular pathways as signalling molecules. However, they also have negative effects like inflammation and cytotoxicity. ROS can function as intermediates in varying pathways, but they are also widely regarded as etiologic factors for diseases including cancer, inflammation and organ injuries. Evidence suggests that the scavenging ROS in pathological condition may reduce cell damage and control the pathological process. However, other researches also indicate the positive side of enhancing ROS in diseases. Thus, the mechanisms of how ROS influences diseases remain obscure. Europeans have dedicated to the study of ROS and made a comprehensive exploration [95]. Yet, it remains controversial in results of ROS-targeted strategies applied to clinical research. With the advancement in technique, ROS can be measured in living cells of its transient generation with Y0.6Eu0.4VO4 nanoparticles by illuminating under oxidative conditions [96]. Specific chemical probes and low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique could monitor ROS level of tumour cells in vitro and in vivo [97]. Other environmental factors like pH and ion concentration are also suggested in ROS regulation and generation [98]. Also magnetic fields could influence cellular ROS level according to its intensity, frequency and exposure time [99].",

            "text": "The fundamental understandings of ROS remain basically the same in the past 20 years. ROS are generally regarded as signalling molecules and harmful particles. Researchers always focus on ROS levels and their results and analyses them from a single perspective. They should be illuminated from different perspectives and with extensive sight. Based upon the characteristics of ROS discovered by previous researches, I provide a hypothesis here that may explain the competing results so far. ROS thrives in conditions that abundant energy is in demand for vigorous metabolism, either in cancer cells\u2019 proliferation and inflammatory necrosis, or immunological defence required immune system functioning. Thus, ROS do not just act as signalling molecules. They may present as basic energy particles like other acknowledged basic nutrient particles including proteins and carbohydrates. And they provide a much more fundamental impact on cellular metabolism. It is more likely that ROS respond to elevated metabolism to fulfil energy demand, rather than directly bending itself to oxidative stress, which interprets why different researches demonstrate controversial outcome in regulating ROS. The treatment of both inhibition and enhancement of ROS in cancer in vitro may due to exhausted energy supply for metabolism and overload of energy supply-induced oxidative damage, rather than just the regulation of a byproduct. Of course, it is easier to suppress ROS generation with antioxidants or genetic depletion in experimental animal models. But the inability of clinically gene modulation in vivo and the multiple functions of ROS in metabolism may lead to limited potrential of direct ROS modulation in diseases with ROS and metabolic imbalance. The fundamental role of ROS grants them with the potential in metabolic regulation. From another aspect, the essence that ROS are common particles with comprehensive distribution endows them with more fundamental mechanisms to be explored.",
