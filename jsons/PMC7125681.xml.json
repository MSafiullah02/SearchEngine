There are four species of Ebola virus that have been identified: Zaire, Sudan, Ivory Coast, and Reston. All four species differ in their virulence; thus acute mortality in human outbreaks is typically greater than 80% for Ebola virus Zaire strain and greater than 50% for Sudan. Ebola Zaire and Sudan viruses are the most widespread and have been responsible for the majority of the recent hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in humans [1], [2], [3]. The last large outbreak occurred in 2000\u20132001 in the Gulu district of Uganda. In total, there were 425 cases with 224 deaths. This case fatality rate of 53% was similar to that observed for two previous outbreaks of Ebola virus Sudan in 1976 and 1979 in which 53% and 66% of cases died, respectively [4], [5], [6].",

            "text": "In the field of optical fiber immunosensors, we have previously demonstrated that optical fibers, which are made of doped silica and hence are electrically inert, can be modified by an electrically conductive layer [16], [17], [18], [19]. This fiber-optic electroconductive surface modification was achieved by deposition of a thin layer of indium tin oxide (ITO). ITO is an indium oxide (In2O3)-based material that has been doped with tin oxide (SnO2) to improve its electrical quality. Tin acts as a cationic dopant in the In2O3 lattice and substitutes indium sites to bind with interstitial oxygen. The presence of SnO2 results in n doping of the lattice because the dopant adds electrons to the conduction band [20]. We must take care to produce thinner films of indium tin oxide even though there is a correlation between thicker films and lower resistivity, as lower light transmission may occur due to absorption by the film [21]. Since sputtering is one of the most extensively used techniques for deposition of transparent conducting oxide films, it was selected as the deposition technique. This method renders far better control over the stoichiometry, obviating, in most cases, the heat treatment step, which is usually performed after deposition of the film. Highly transparent and conductive films of ITO have been previously deposited by this technique [16], [22].",

Modification of an optical fiber with pyrrole-benzophenone film allows the photoactivable linking of a biological receptor, inactivated Ebola virus, to the tip of the fiber-optic surface (Fig. 1\n). This innovative photoelectrochemical method for immobilization of biological macromolecules combines the advantages of photolithography with those of the electrochemical deposition of polymer films.",

When modified into an \u201ceasy-to-use\u201d procedure, this technology might be used in the future in a field operable clinical tool for Ebola virus antibody screening.

Tests of samples were performed in triplicate and under identical conditions, with the same materials, in both immunosensor and ELISA assays. Therefore, this enables a direct comparison of results, and reveals that the immunosensor is much more sensitive than chemiluminescence ELISA and is likely capable of recognizing virus specific antibody presence in the sera of patients in earlier stages of disease. Finally, the optical fiber immunoassay showed a greater lower detection limit than ELISA. Since ELISA uses absorption as the immobilization methodology for the antigen, a change in protein conformation may occur. Therefore the loss of putative epitopic binding sites would reduce their potential for binding to antibodies, while the covalent immobilization would offer a reduction in such a loss.",

This is significant as following the emergence of Ebola hemorrhagic fever there is an undetectable or very negligible elevation in the concentration of the IgG antibodies in the sera using conventional techniques. As a result, the immunosensor has great potential for clinical and serological studies of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. In addition, the fiber-optic immunosensor assay is less time consuming than standard ELISA (approximately 2 h versus 4 h, respectively, after antigen binding, thus constituting a real gain in time for high-throughput diagnosis). Therefore the immunosensor will enable an earlier detection of the production of antibodies, whereas the standard ELISA will only detect them at a more advanced stage, when the level of the antibodies reaches a high concentration [3], [8], [26], [27], [28].",

As a valid negative control for this test we used the serum of a healthy individual from Israel, and in addition, the sera samples of healthy volunteers from the Gulu district of Uganda. Although these data are limited by the number of sera samples available for verification, one of the healthy volunteers from the same geographical region showed a positive reaction to inactivated Ebola virus when tested with the immunosensor. An ELISA test for the same person was negative due to relatively low sensitivity of the method as was reviled in standard calibration curves for ELISA and immunosensor (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Also due to limited number of sera samples, the one negative serum (in ELISA) that was converted to positive by our method could be a false positive result.",

Using a more sensitive detection method, such as the immunosensor presented herein, will enable serological studies among the population of endemic areas that may strengthen the hypothesis that one can develop some immunity to the Ebola virus without developing clinical illness. Consequently the Ebola virus might leave its footprint in some individuals without causing an active infection.
