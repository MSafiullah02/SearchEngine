PRRS is a global disease that has an immense economic impact on the swine industry. The causative agent, the PRRS virus (PRRSV), was first described as the Lelystad virus in Europe (Wensvoort et al., 1991) and VR-2332 in the US (Benfield et al., 1992, Collins et al., 1992). PRRSV is a member of the family Arteriviridae and belongs to the order Nidovirales along with equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) (Cavanagh, 1997, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998).",

The viral structural proteins are encoded by ORFs 2\u20137 (Meulenberg et al., 1993). ORF5, 6, and 7 encode the three major structural proteins (the envelope glycoprotein, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins, respectively), while ORF2a, 2b, 3 and 4 express four minor structural proteins (Meulenberg et al., 1997, Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998, Snijder and Meulenberg, 2001, Dea et al., 2000).",

            "text": "PRRSV emerged almost simultaneously in Europe and North America with very similar disease symptoms. Surprisingly, however, the two PRRSV isolates share only 55\u201370% nucleotide identity in their genes (Kwang et al., 1994, Mardassi et al., 1994, Meng et al., 1994, Meng et al., 1995a, Morozov et al., 1995, Murtaugh et al., 1995, Gagnon and Dea, 1998, Nelsen et al., 1999). Thus, Lelystad and VR-2332 are considered as the reference strains of the European and the American genotypes, respectively. Additional PRRSV strains have since been isolated from pigs at different times and locations. Most have been partially sequenced. Previous phylogenetic analyses have mainly focused on partial ORF5 sequences (Meng et al., 1995b, Suarez et al., 1996, Andreyev et al., 1997, Madsen et al., 1998, Goldberg et al., 2000, Indik et al., 2000, Key et al., 2001, Forsberg et al., 2002, Stadejek et al., 2002, Mateu et al., 2003), which appears to be the most variable protein when the American and European isolates are compared (Murtaugh et al., 1995, Kapur et al., 1996) and shows the highest degree of genetic diversity within a single genotype (Suarez et al., 1996, Pirzadeh et al., 1998). Other studies have also investigated the PRRSV genetic relationships by comparing the ORF7 nucleotide sequences (Meng et al., 1995a, Suarez et al., 1996, Drew et al., 1997, Chueh et al., 1998, Le Gall et al., 1998, Madsen et al., 1998, Medveczky et al., 2001, Forsberg et al., 2002, Stadejek et al., 2002) or other proteins (Meng et al., 1995b, Drew et al., 1997, Madsen et al., 1998, Nelsen et al., 1999, Oleksiewicz et al., 2000).",

First-strand cDNA was first synthesized from the viral RNA by Superscript II RT using the 5\u2032-end-unphosphorylated primer PR50. To remove RNA from the first-strand cDNA\u2013RNA hybrid, it was degraded at 30 \u00b0C for 1 h in a 75 \u03bcl reaction mixture containing 60 U RNase H, 20 \u03bcl first-strand cDNA reaction mixture, and the buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Takara). The resulting first-strand cDNA was phenol-extracted, precipitated with 100% ethanol, and resuspended in 14 \u03bcl RNase-free water. To introduce a primer-binding site, the 3\u2032-end of the first-strand cDNA was ligated to synthetic oligonucleotides. A synthetic oligonucleotide X (PRX) was phosphorylated at its 5\u2032-end and modified at its 3\u2032-end by the incorporation of ddATP to prevent intra- and inter-molecular ligation, as described previously (Yun et al., 2003). The first-strand cDNA was ligated with this PRX at 16 \u00b0C for 12 h in a 40 \u03bcl reaction mixture containing 40 U T4 RNA ligase, 7 \u03bcl single-stranded cDNA, 10 pmol PRX, 20% PEG #6000, and the buffer (Takara). The PRX-ligated cDNA was then phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 20 \u03bcl RNase-free water. One-twentieth of this was PCR amplified using the PR49 forward primer and the PRXR reverse primer with 30 cycles of the same program described above except that the extensions at 72 \u00b0C took 1\u20135 min. This was followed by a 10 min extension step at 72 \u00b0C. Agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that the products amplified in reactions containing RT migrated predominantly as a band of \u2248500 bp (data not shown). No band was observed in reactions lacking PRX during ligation or RT during cDNA synthesis (data not shown). The \u2248500 bp cDNA amplicon was purified and the 334 bp Pst I-Sac I PCR fragment was inserted into the Pst I-Sac I-digested pRS2 vector.

Briefly, 5\u2032-phosphorylated and 3\u2019-blocked PRX was ligated to the 3\u2032-end of the viral RNA at 16 \u00b0C for 12 h in a 20 \u03bcl reaction mixture containing 10 U T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), 40 U RNaseOUT, 10 pmol PRX, extracted viral RNA, and the buffer supplied by the manufacturer. After incubation, the PRX-ligated viral RNA was phenol-extracted, precipitated with 100% ethanol, and resuspended in 20 \u03bcl RNase-free water. Half was subsequently used for cDNA synthesis using Superscript II RT and the PRXR primer, as described above. First-strand cDNA was amplified using forward primer PR41 and reverse primer PRXR. For PCR, one quarter of the RT product was amplified by 30 cycles of the same program described above except that the extension at 72 \u00b0C took 1 min. This was followed by the usual 10 min extension step. As resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, minor products were nonspecifically amplified in the absence of PRX during ligation (data not shown). These minor products were not further analyzed since no product was found in a nested PCR with a pair of PRRSV-specific inner primers. The appearance of these minor products might be explained by self-priming of the 3\u2032-end portion of PRRSV RNA to the complementary sequence present in its upstream of the viral genome and subsequent nonspecific PCR amplification. In contrast, a prominent band of \u2248450 bp was produced from the PRX-ligated genomic RNA (data not shown). No bands were observed in reactions lacking RT, as expected (data not shown). The \u2248450 bp cDNA amplicon was purified and the 384 bp Mfe I-Pst I fragment of the cDNA amplicons was cloned into the EcoR I-Pst I-digested pRS2 vector.

Six RT-PCR cDNA amplicons covering the entire RNA genome were directly sequenced to avoid selection bias that might have taken place during cloning. To ensure sequencing accuracy, we not only repeated the RT-PCR with two independently isolated viral RNAs but also sequenced both strands of the amplicons. Thus, the PL97-1 strain RNA genome was sequenced at least once with a minimum redundancy of 4.0. The complete PL97-1 genome was found to be 15411 nucleotides long excluding the poly(A) tail. It consists of a 189-nucleotide 5\u2032NCR, a 15071-nucleotide protein-coding region (9 ORFs), and a 151-nucleotide 3\u2032NCR. Comparison of this genome with that of 11 other fully sequenced PRRSV strains (Table 2) available from GenBank showed sequence divergence ranged from 0.3 to 38.0%. PL97-1 diverged most from the Dutch Lelystad strain (38.0%) (Table 3\n, upper right).

The 37-nucleotide shorter 3\u2032NCR of the Lelystad strain is due to a string of 3, 18, and 17 nucleotide deletions at the beginning of its 3\u2032NCR (Fig. 1B, open box) as well as an insertion of A at position 128.

However, frequent nucleotide alterations were found to be evenly distributed throughout the genomes (Fig. 2A). At the amino acid level, however, more local accumulation of amino acid alterations was found in the N-terminal half of the nonstructural protein ORF1a corresponding to the nsp1b and nsp2 proteins and the structural proteins such as ORF4 and ORF5, whereas less variation was found in the C-terminal half of the nonstructural protein ORF1a and the entire nonstructural protein ORF1b (Fig. 2B).

A full-length genome-based phylogenetic tree reveals that there are two distinct phylogenetic groups based on their geographical origin (Fig. 3A\n). The European genotype consists only of the Dutch Lelystad strain, while the North American genotype contains the other 11 PRRSV isolates, which are from Canada, China, Korea, and USA. Two separate clusters with high bootstrap support were defined in the North American genotype. In the first cluster, the two American isolates P129 and NVSL 97-7985 were most closely related to the two Chinese isolates CH-1a and HB-1(sh)/2002, but each formed a separate minor branch. In the second cluster, three isolates from Canada (PA8), Korea (PL97-1), and USA (VR-2332) were closely related to the VR-2332-derived vaccine strain designated as RespPRRS MLV or MLV RespPRRS/Repro and the Chinese BJ-4 isolate, but each formed a single minor branch. The American 16244B strain was also grouped in the second cluster but formed a single minor branch. While the SP vaccine strain was related to the other PRRSV isolates in the second cluster, it formed a distinct branch. The genomes of LDV and SHFV, two other members of the Arteriviridae family, were included in the phylogenetic analyses to provide information on divergence levels in comparison to other arteriviruses. Both viruses appeared in all phylogenetic trees as a separate distant branch, showing that these viruses are significantly different from all PRRSV strains (Fig. 3).",

This partial sequence information makes difficult to fully investigate the genetic relationships between the large and heterogeneous pool of the PRRSV isolates. Consequently, we searched for an optimal subregion that would accurately represent the full-length genome-based phylogenetic topology and performed phylogenetic analyses based on each viral gene, including ORF5 and ORF7, and the 5\u2032NCR or 3\u2032NCR, using the 12 fully sequenced strains. The resulting phylogenetic trees were compared to the full-length genome-based phylogenetic tree. The ORF1b gene-based phylogenetic tree most closely resembled the full-length genome-based phylogenetic tree in that it shows the two distinct phylogenetic groups and clusters of the latter tree (Fig. 3B, compared to Fig. 3A). The phylogenetic trees based on the ORF5 and 7 genes, which are the most frequently sequenced genes in the database to date, revealed overall similar tree topologies to the full-length genome-based phylogenetic tree, but with minor differences. In the ORF7 tree, NVSL 97-7985 was related to the members of the first cluster of the North American genotype but forms a distinct branch (Fig. 3C). The ORF5 gene-based phylogenetic tree showed that the SP strain was more closely related to the members of the first cluster within the North American genotype than those of the second cluster (Fig. 3D).",

Two distinct phylogenetic groupings that corresponded to the European and North American genotypes were identified with 100% bootstrap support (Fig. 4A\n), as previously described (Meulenberg et al., 1993, Murtaugh et al., 1995, Nelsen et al., 1999, Dea et al., 2000, Meng, 2000). The majority of strains in the European genotype group were defined by four clusters (Fig. 4B). The first consisted of two early Spanish and Danish isolates (L56/2/91, 1991, and 340-1, 1994), a relatively recent Hungarian isolate (ABV 32-13, 1999), and two Italian isolates (7571/96, 1996 and 2481/97, 1997). The second cluster contained Italian isolates from the early 1990s and one from 1997 (1142/97), while the third consisted of most Danish isolates from 1992 to 1998. The fourth cluster contained early 1990 isolates from the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, Germany, UK, Italy, Belgium, and France, including Lelystad. In addition, four Italian strains (2567/96, 2029/97, 3943/96, and 974/98) isolated in the late 1990\u2019s and two Polish strains (Nie and Rak) isolated in 1997 were closely related to the other PRRSV isolates in this genotype, but each formed a single minor branch. While two recent Lithuanian isolates in this genotype were closely related to each other, they were found to be the most divergent from these isolates with a high bootstrap support.",

This latter cluster also contained a Spanish strain (GenBank accession no. AF317692) and the two fully sequenced Asian strains PL97-1 (Korea, 1997) and BJ-4 (China). The VR-2332-derived vaccine strain designated as MLV RespPRRS/Repro or RespPRRS MLV also belonged to this cluster. However, the SP vaccine strain appeared to be closely related to the Canadian IAF-exp91 isolate, and formed a separate branch. Two closely related Japanese isolates (Kitasato 93-1 and EDRD-1) did not belong to any of these clusters in the North American genotype, which indicates that they are distantly related to other North American strains. The USA 93-14620 isolate also formed a distinguishable branch and was less closely related to other isolates in the North American genotype.",

Its genetic relationship with a large selection of PRRSV strains isolated at different time periods from different geographic regions was also assessed. Significantly, the 5\u2032-end of the fully sequenced PRRSV genomes appears to be heterogeneous. The 5\u2032-end of PL97-1 begins with 1ATG ACG TAT AGG12, which is identical to six other fully sequenced PRRSV genomes, including VR-2332 (U87392). However, this sequence is not present in the 5\u2032-ends of NVSL 97-7985 (AF325691) and MLV RespPRRS/Repro (AF159149), whose 5\u2032-ends consist of T and G, respectively. An additional T was identified in BJ-4 (AF331831) and RespPRRS MLV (AF066183). Previous studies also reported an additional T in VR-2332 (Oleksiewicz et al., 1999, Shen et al., 2000). However, this additional T is not found in the 5\u2032-ends of the two vaccine strains RespPRRS MLV (Oleksiewicz et al., 1999) and SP (Shen et al., 2000). Moreover, Yuan et al. (2001) observed an additional T in the 5\u2032-end of the RespPRRS vaccine strain but not in VR-2332. An additional dinucleotide AC was also identified in 111/92 (Oleksiewicz et al., 1999). The 5\u2032-end of 16244B was defined as 1CGC CCG GGC AGG12 (Allende et al., 1999). Thus, it appears that the 5\u2032-end of the PRRSV genome can consist of any of the four nucleotides. This is unusual given that the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032-end nucleotide sequences of positive-sense RNA viruses are highly conserved because they are generally important in RNA replication and transcription. This heterogenicity of the PRRSV 5\u2032-end sequence should be further investigated for its relevance. Interestingly, both ends of viral sequences have been shown to not only play an important role in the replication of coronaviruses, another member of the order Nidovirales (Williams et al., 1999), but they are also related to poliovirus attenuation (Westrop et al., 1989).",

However, the predicted secondary RNA structures of the 5\u2032NCR has suggested that its 5\u2032 three-quarters forms three conserved stem-loop structures in the North American genotypes and two in the European strains, whereas the 3\u2032 quarter that includes the highly conserved 45 nucleotides was predicted to be a variable domain (Tan et al., 2001). Thus, the nucleotide sequence of the highly conserved 45 nucleotides, rather than its secondary structure, might be critical for viral replication/transcription. In comparison, the PRRSV 3\u2032NCR sequence is less divergent and a 23-nucleotide stretch in the middle of the 3\u2032NCR was absolutely conserved in all 12 fully sequenced PRRSV genomes. Thus, it may play an important role in viral replication. The Lelystad genome also contained three deletions of 3-, 18-, and 17-nucleotides in the beginning of its 3\u2032NCR, which suggests that this region may not be required for viral replication. A recent study of infectious Lelystad cDNA revealed that the deletion of the 7 nucleotides, but not of 32 nucleotides, immediately downstream of ORF7 did not affect infectious virus production (Verheije et al., 2001). Further investigations are needed to elucidate this issue.",

Our assessment of the genetic relationships between all 12 full-length PRRSV genomes supports this classification, which reflects their geographical origin. We showed that the Lelystad strain was distantly related to the other fully sequenced strains and formed the only fully sequenced European genotype isolate to date, while the other 11 strains, including PL97-1, formed the North American genotype.

Extensive ORF7 gene-based phylogenetic analysis using 111 selected strains confirmed the phylogenetic relationships determined with the 12 fully sequenced strains. The ORF7 gene-based analysis also showed high genetic variation exists not only between two genotypes but also within each genotype, as indicated previously (Meng et al., 1995b, Forsberg et al., 2002). Moreover, major nucleotide differences in the ORF1 have also been described previously (Allende et al., 1999). Although the functional significance of this genetic variation remains to be determined, antigenic differences between two genotypes on a serological basis have been reported (Drew et al., 1995, Katz et al., 1995, Sorensen et al., 1998).

            "text": "From an evolutionary point of view, it appears that two different PRRSV genotypes rose simultaneously in Europe and North America (Wensvoort et al., 1991, Benfield et al., 1992, Collins et al., 1992). Each genotype contains strains that were isolated from the same geographic location in the same or another year yet belong to different clusters. This may reflect the introduction of a new variant strain into the same geographic location by, for example, animal or semen transport. This is supported by a recent study suggested that the genetic variation of the different strains in the same herd was caused by animal or semen transport rather than by local evolution (Madsen et al., 1998, Goldberg et al., 2000). Alternatively, the preexisting strains may evolve locally into new variants during intra- and inter-animal spread due to a combination of the error-prone viral RNA polymerase and selective pressure. These two scenarios are not mutually exclusive and depend largely on geographic location and time of isolation. With regard to the Japanese encephalitis virus, all known five viral genotypes including the oldest are found in a region of Indonesia\u2013Malaysia. However, newer genotypes appear to have spread from this region into other geographical locations at given time periods (Solomon et al., 2003). If this is the case for PRRVS as well, the origin of PRRSV where both genotypes can be found remains to be discovered. The recent genetic characterization of PRRSV strains isolated from Eastern Europe suggests that the current European isolates might be derived from a common ancestor that is closely related to the North American isolates (Stadejek et al., 2002).",

There are two possible explanations for this similarity. First, the modified live vaccine used in Korea since 1996 may have persisted and mutated into a less attenuated variant, causing clinical signs upon infection and spread. That PRRSV persists and undergoes limited but consistent mutations has been demonstrated experimentally in infected pigs (Allende et al., 2000). A vaccine-derived field isolate was demonstrated directly to cause reproductive problems by experimental inoculation (Nielsen et al., 1998). Moreover, that vaccine strains can revert into more virulent variants has been suggested to occur in both US (Mengeling et al., 1999) and Denmark (Botner et al., 1997, Madsen et al., 1998, Storgaard et al., 1999). Alternatively, the prevalent field isolates in Korea were already coincidentally similar to VR-2332 prior to the introduction of the modified live vaccine.",

            "text": "Of these two possibilities, the high genetic similarity to the VR-2332-derived vaccine strain and its parent virus is very suggestive that the PL97-1 might be reverted from the vaccine strain. Especially, this idea is supported by analyzing for the amino acid changes of PL97-1 compared to the VR-2332-derived vaccine and several vaccine-derived field isolates. The PL97-1 strain appeared to contain the three reversion mutations (codon positions 331 of ORF1a, 946 of ORF1b, and 151 of ORF5), which invariably found in all field isolates of PRRSV reported by other investigators (Madsen et al., 1998, Storgaard et al., 1999, Wesley et al., 1999, Nielsen et al., 2001). The former two reversion mutations were observed independently in all seven Danish vaccine-derived field isolates (Nielsen et al., 2001) and in the pathogenic American vaccine-like isolate, 16244B (Allende et al., 1999, Allende et al., 2000). This indicates strong parallel selective pressure on these positions in the vaccine virus when used in swine herds, involved in the attenuation of the vaccine strain and the subsequent reversion to virulence. The amino acid residue at position 151 of ORF5 was shown to be different between the vaccine strain (Gly151) and its parent virus (Arg151) and a positively charged Arg151 was found in most of field isolates of PRRSV (Meng et al., 1994, Meng et al., 1995b, Mardassi et al., 1995, Kapur et al., 1996, Andreyev et al., 1997, Madsen et al., 1998, Wesley et al., 1998, Wesley et al., 1999, Storgaard et al., 1999, Allende et al., 2000). Besides, the amino acid residue at position 16 of ORF6 has been identified as a candidate virulence determinant, reverting from a Glu to the Gln found in the VR-2332 strain (Madsen et al., 1998, Storgaard et al., 1999, Allende et al., 2000). We found that the PL97-1 had also undergone exactly the same reversion mutation.",
