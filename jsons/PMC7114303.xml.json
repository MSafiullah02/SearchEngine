The antiviral activity of these direct-acting antiviral agents is usually virus-specific, but there are numerous examples of treatment failure due to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses. In contrast, targeting host functions essential for viral replication has been considered as a potential broad-spectrum and resistance-refractory therapeutic approach. Accordingly, many host cellular proteins involved in nucleoside metabolism, RNA capping, protein folding and glycan processing have been empirically explored as broad-spectrum antiviral targets (De Clercq, 2004, Geller et al., 2012). Recently, the advent of genome-wide technologies has allowed for systematic identification and validation of potential host cellular targets for antiviral drug development (de Chassey et al., 2012, Hong-Geller and Micheva-Viteva, 2010, Meliopoulos et al., 2012, Watanabe et al., 2010).",

For ER \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors in particular, 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and castanopermine (CAST) derivatives have been demonstrated in the last three decades by many independent research groups to inhibit the morphogenesis of many enveloped viruses (reviewed in Dwek et al., 2002). Several DNJ and CAST derivatives have been demonstrated to reduce viremia of dengue virus (DENV), and/or protect mice from lethal dose of DENV (Chang et al., 2011a, Chang et al., 2011b, Miller et al., 2012, Perry et al., 2013, Rathore et al., 2011, Schul et al., 2007, Watanabe et al., 2012, Whitby et al., 2005), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (Wu et al., 2002), Ebola virus (EBOV) and Marburg virus (MARV) challenge in mice (Chang et al., 2013). Reduction in viremia by a DNJ derivative, N-nonyl-DNJ (NN-DNJ), was also shown in vivo in woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), a model virus for human hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Block et al., 1994). Furthermore, human clinical trials of NB-DNJ and Bu-CAST have been performed to test their antiviral efficacy against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), respectively. In both cases, modest reduction in virus titer in the serum of some of the treated patients was observed (Durantel, 2009, Fischl et al., 1994).",

Such broad-spectrum antiviral agents would be particularly promising in the management of viral hemorrhagic fever and respiratory tract viral infections. Both medical conditions are caused by many different viruses and have a short treatment window for medical intervention (Hussell et al., 2012, Jartti et al., 2012, Paessler and Walker, 2013). Development of drugs with broad-spectrum antiviral activity for these acute infections obviously holds clear clinical advantages in comparison with virus-specific antiviral agents, which rely on time-consuming etiologic diagnosis.",

            "text": "Most proteins synthesized in the ER are glycoproteins. N-linked glycosylation is the most common type of glycosylation process, that occurs in the ER lumen in eukaryotes, and is initiated by the addition of a preformed oligosaccharide precursor Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to an asparagines motif on the nascent polypeptide, by oligosaccharyltransferase. The N-linked oligosaccharide moieties serve highly diverse functions that are essential for the folding, sorting, secretion and function of the glycoproteins (Helenius and Aebi, 2004). As illustrated in Fig. 1\n, the initial steps of N-linked oligosaccharide processing on a glycoprotein in the ER involve the sequential trimming of the three glucose residues on an oligosaccharide by the two ER glycoside cleaving enzymes, \u03b1-glucosidases I and II. \u03b1-glucosidase I removes the outer \u03b1-1,2-linked glucose residue and \u03b1-glucosidase II removes the two inner \u03b1-1,3-linked glucose residues. These processes are required for the proper folding and function of many glycoproteins by allowing their interaction with ER chaperones, calnexin and calreticulin (Hebert et al., 1995). ER contains a unique calnexin-dependent folding and quality control machinery in which calnexin/calreticuline act as chaperones and bind proteins with monoglucosidated glycan side chains. Incompletely folded proteins are re-glucosylated by UDP-glucosyltransferase 1, which serves as a sensor for correct protein folding. The properly folded proteins are eventually released from the re- and de-glucosylation cycle and moved to the Golgi complexes for further processing (Hammond et al., 1994). Abrogation of normal glycoprotein trafficking and processing by inhibition of ER \u03b1-glucosidases I and II, results in terminal glucose retention on N-linked glycans and subsequent generation of mis-folded glycoproteins, which may be retained in the ER and ultimately be directed to undergo ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (Alonzi et al., 2013, Simsek et al., 2005). Some of the mis-folded glycoproteins manage to escape the ER quality control, and end up expressed on the cell surface in the presence of glucosidase inhibition, but may present with compromised functionality (Burke et al., 1984, McLaughlin and Vandenbroeck, 2011).",

Moreover, due to the highly dynamic nature of viral replication, it is conceivable that inhibition of ER \u03b1-glucosidases might preferentially disturb the maturation and function of viral envelope glycoproteins, which may consequentially reduce virion particle assembly, secretion and/or infectivity. Indeed, the essential role of cellular ER \u03b1-glucosidase II in the DENV life cycle was demonstrated in a genome-wide siRNA knockdown study (Sessions et al., 2009). In addition, suppression of ER \u03b1-glucosidase I and/or II expression with RNA interference technology efficiently reduced the yields of enveloped RNA viruses, such as DENV and HCV (Qu et al., 2011, Yu et al., 2012).",

Among these natural products, DNJ and CAST have been well documented for their broad-spectrum antiviral activities through inhibition of ER \u03b1-glucosidases I and II. Both DNJ and CAST are generally referred as imino sugars. As shown in Fig. 2\n, DNJ is a 6-membered-ring polyhydroxylated secondary amine in which the molecule resembles a monosaccharide (glucose) with the ring oxygen replaced by nitrogen. CAST is indolizidine imino sugar, in which an ethylene links the endocyclic nitrogen to create a fused 5,6-ring system. Because imino sugars are similar in structure to glucose, the substrate of ER \u03b1-glucosidases, they competitively inhibit ER \u03b1-glucosidases I and II as transition-state substrate analogues (Hempel et al., 1993).",

Interestingly, multiple hemorrhagic fever viruses from four viral families, such as DENV, EBOV, Lassa fever, Junin, and Rift Valley fever virus are all sensitive to glucosidase inhibitor treatment (Chang et al., 2013, Noble et al., 2010, Silber et al., 1993). Although these viruses each have distinct genome structures and replication strategies, they are all enveloped with glycosylated viral proteins and therefore share a similar morphogenesis pathway that depends on the host glycoprotein processing machinery in the ER. However, it seems that not all viral glycoproteins are equally dependent on this mechanism to achieve functional conformations. For example, WNV was relatively less sensitive to imino sugar \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors than other flaviviruses, such as DENV (Chang et al., 2009, Whitby et al., 2005). In addition, certain strains of VSV (Orsay) and influenza A virus (PR-8) were also reported to be insensitive to ER \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors (Datema et al., 1984, Schlesinger et al., 1984).",

This has been demonstrated by the mobility shift of the intracellular viral glycoproteins in electrophoresis (Chang et al., 2009, Hammond et al., 1994, Taylor et al., 1994) and directly confirmed by analyzing glycan structures attached to the specific viral glycoproteins (Ritchie et al., 2010). As a consequence of the incomplete glucose trimming of N-linked oligosaccharide, the productive folding pathway of the viral glycoprotein is affected. This usually results in the reduced efficiency of virion assembly and secretion through degradation of viral glycoproteins bearing unprocessed N-linked oligosaccharide. In fact, it was well documented that imino sugars dose-dependently induced the mobility shift as well as degradation of the envelope glycoproteins of viruses from several families (Chang et al., 2009, Fukushi et al., 2012, Qu et al., 2011). Occasionally, the incomplete glucose trimming also affects virion secretion through prevention of the further processing and trafficking of viral glycoproteins. For instance, inhibition of the ER \u03b1-glucosidases delayed the formation and reduced the stability of DENV prM/E heterodimer (Courageot et al., 2000) or blocked the proteolytic cleavage of Sindbis virus precursor envelope glycoprotein (Datema et al., 1984).",

In one extreme case, CMV infected cells continued to shed virions into the extracellular medium in the presence of CAST, as determined by electron microscopy, and the antiviral effect was mainly due to the reduction in infectivity as a result of the alteration of components on the virion envelope (Taylor et al., 1988). Another example is that imino sugars inhibited HIV infectivity at a post-CD4 binding step, by preventing the conformational change of glycoprotein gp-120 (Fischer et al., 1995, Fischer et al., 1996a, Fischer et al., 1996b). Nevertheless, for most enveloped viruses, it is more likely that reductions in both virion secretion and the infectivity are responsible for overall antiviral effects (Chapel et al., 2006, Fischer et al., 1996b, Lazar et al., 2007).",

A study has been reported in HIV infection, where pre-treatment of HIV-permissive CD4+ cells with Bu-CAST substantially reduced their capacity to bind with cells chronically infected with HIV-1 (Bridges et al., 1994). To further test this hypothesis, we recently tested the effects of several DNJ-derivatives on the infection of retroviruses pseudotyped with envelope proteins from eight different families of viruses and demonstrated that the compounds efficiently inhibited the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and human coronavirus NL63 spike protein-mediated entry (Zhao and Guo, unpublished observations).",

For example, it usually requires millimolar concentrations of DNJ to inhibit viruses. Thus, extensive lead optimization efforts have been made to obtain DNJ derivatives with improved antiviral efficacy (reviewed in Moorthy et al., 2012, Nash et al., 2011, Sayce et al., 2010). However, due to the lack of structural information of human ER \u03b1-glucosidases, all the lead optimization efforts have thus far been empirical. As mentioned above, DNJ is a substrate (glucose) analogue which competitively inhibits the ER \u03b1-glucosidases I and II. So far, limited attempts to alter the DNJ core structure have either not yielded derivatives with significantly improved antiviral activity, or resulted in loss of enzymatic inhibitory activity (Dwek et al., 2002, Horne et al., 2011, Zitzmann et al., 1999). The only exception is that a few five-membered iminocyclitol glucosidase inhibitors were demonstrated to have antiviral activity (Asano et al., 1995, Chapman et al., 2005, Liang et al., 2006). In contrast, the nitrogen atom in the DNJ ring structure provides a unique opportunity for generating a class of derivatives with DNJ as head group and various N-linked alkyl side chains. During the last two decades, more than 200 DNJ derivatives distinct in the length and composition of the N-linked side chains have been synthesized. Several strategies have been used to diversify the side-chain structures, which include heteroatom substitution, addition of terminal ring structure and conformation restriction. Through extensive comparison of antiviral activities, we have now obtained DNJ derivatives with submicromolar antiviral activity against several different viruses (Chang et al., 2009, Chang et al., 2013). Interestingly, it appears that compounds with more potent antiviral activity usually have a similar length of side chains, such as an approximately 9-carbon linear alkyl side chain or a 6-carbon linear chain linked with a terminal ring structure (Du et al., 2013, Howe et al., 2013, Yu et al., 2012) (Fig. 2). It is possible that those hydrophobic side chains anchor the DNJ derivatives on the ER membrane and present the DNJ head toward the active center of \u03b1-glucosidases (Kajimoto and Node, 2009, Moorthy et al., 2012). Hence, it is conceivable that proper length of the side chain is critical for optimal inhibition of the ER \u03b1-glucosidases, which are also integrated ER membrane proteins.",

While most SAR work has been focused on DNJ derivatives, very limited modification has been performed for CAST, partly due to the more complicated chemical nature of this pharmacophore.

This is because long term imino sugar treatment only resulted in mild reduction in viremia in a small proportion of treated individuals and brought limited clinical benefits in clinical trials of treating HIV and HCV-infected patients (Durantel, 2009, Fischl et al., 1994).

These observations raise the possibility that imino sugar derivatives prevent the DENV-induced death of mice not only by inhibiting virus propagation, but also through suppression of viral pathogenesis.

            "text": "It is generally acknowledged that massive production of inflammatory cytokines, secondary to macrophage and dendritic cell infection by the hemorrhagic fever viruses, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of viral hemorrhagic fever (Geisbert and Jahrling, 2004). However, the molecular mechanisms of the virus-induced \u201ccytokine storm\u201d and the cytokin mediated blood vessel leakage and other tissue damage remain elusive for most of the hemorrhagic fever viruses. In the case of DENV infection, it has been demonstrated with mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from RIG-I- and MDA5-knockout mice that DENV infection is sequentially recognized by two cytoplasmic RNA helicase receptors, RIG-I- and MDA5. Sensing of DENV infection by these two receptors results in activation of both type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokine expression via their adaptor protein IPS-1 (or MAVS, Cardif and VISA)-dependent activation of IRF3 and NF-kB signaling pathways (Loo et al., 2008). However, DENV infection of macrophages induces a strong type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokine response by simultaneous activation of the plasma membrane C-type lectin receptor CLEC5A that recognizes oligosaccharides on the viral envelope glycoproteins and endosomal TLR7 that presumably recognizes viral genomic RNA (Chen et al., 2008). As illustrated in Fig. 3\n, engagement of the two pattern-recognition receptors by the viral components activates signaling cascades by recruiting their distinct adaptor molecules DAP12 and MyD88 to induce proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons in macrophages. The critical role of CLEC5A and proinflammatory cytokines in DENV pathogenesis was elegantly demonstrated by blockade of CLEC5A\u2013DENV interaction with anti-CLEC5A monoclonal antibodies, which not only inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines, but also alleviated subcutaneous and vital-organ hemorrhagic symptoms and reduced the mortality of infected mice (Chen et al., 2008). Hence, it is entirely possible that by reducing DENV secretion and/or altering the glycan structure of the viral envelope glycoprotein, imino sugar derivatives might inhibit CLEC5A-mediated inflammatory cytokine production and consequentially alleviate viral pathogenesis. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated significant reduction in inflammatory cytokine levels upon treatment of DENV infected animals with imino sugars (Perry et al., 2013, Schul et al., 2007). Therefore, the potential anti-inflammatory activity of imino sugar ER \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors should be further investigated in DENV and other hemorrhagic fever virus infections.",

None of the new generation of DNJ derivatives, with demonstrated significantly improved antiviral potency, has reached the point of clinical trials. Considering the antiviral potency of imino sugar and the treatment goal for different viral infections, the most likely therapeutic applications of the DNJ derivatives should be acute viral infections, particularly viral hemorrhagic fevers and respiratory tract viral infections. The promising antiviral efficacy against DENV and filoviruses in mice warrants their further development as broad-spectrum antiviral agents for hemorrhagic fever viruses. In addition, the potent protective effect of a DNJ derivative UV-4 (Fig. 2) against H1N1 influenza A virus-infected mice (Ramstedt et al. patent number 20110065752. http://www.faqs.org/patents/app/20110065752) and potent antiviral activity and unique antiviral mechanism of other DNJ derivatives against SARS-CoV (Fukushi et al., 2012) also make the imino sugar derivatives potential broad-spectrum antiviral agents against respiratory enveloped RNA virus infections.",

            "text": "Both DNJ- and CAST-derivatives, the two currently available pharmacophores of ER \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors, are glucose mimetics that not only inhibit ER \u03b1-glucosidases, but also other host glucosidases using glucose as substrate. These include intestinal disaccharidases, such as maltase, lactase and sucrose, the enzymes that hydrolyze ingested carbohydrates from disaccharides to monosaccharides (Reuser and Wisselaar, 1994). Not surprisingly, one of the common side-effects of these antiviral compounds is intestinal stress and osmotic diarrhea. Because intestinal disaccharidases localize on the brush border of the small intestine with their active sites facing the lumen, this side effect is largely associated with oral administration of imino sugars, and therefore, could be avoided by the parenteral route of administration. Alternatively, orally available prodrugs of imino sugars can be explored. For example, Bu-CAST is an oral prodrug of CAST which is rapidly converted into CAST in the body. Another approach is ester prodrugs of DNJ that are hydrolyzed in the circulation and intracellular compartments by ubiquitous esterases, thus avoiding inhibition of gut glucosidases (Liederer and Borchardt, 2006). A perbutyrylated ester prodrug of NB-DNJ has been demonstrated to improve the safety profile of the parent compound, however, its bioavailability was compromised in some species of animals, due to the less efficient conversion rate (Cook et al., 1995). In addition, the prodrug approach could increase the exposure of the drug in plasma to achieve an efficacious dose, and improve the metabolic stability of drug to increase the half-life. In the future, other approaches should be explored to optimize the safety profile and the bioconversion of imino sugar prodrugs.",

Achievement of this goal should be facilitated by the recent determination of the crystal structure of a yeast ER \u03b1-glucosidase (Barker and Rose, 2013). In addition, ER-targeted delivery and design of imino sugar derivatives with increased hydrophobicity and ER distribution (Du et al., 2013) are also viable approaches to improving the antiviral efficacy of imino sugars. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that targeted delivery of imino sugars with liposomes to the ER membrane immensely improved their antiviral activity both in cultured cells and in vivo in mice against DENV (Miller et al., 2012, Pollock et al., 2008).",

In fact, this approach has been explored by others for the identification of gut maltase-specific inhibitors for the treatment of diabetes (Hakamata et al., 2012). Development of a convenient fluorescent substrate-based in vitro enzymatic assay for ER \u03b1-glucosidases will be the first step towards discovery of novel allosteric inhibitors, which may ultimately improve ER \u03b1-glucosidase-targeted antiviral therapy (Hakamata et al., 2009).",

In the future, a combined effort of rationally designed chemical modification, ER-targeted drug delivery and prodrug design should further improve the efficacy and safety profiles of imino sugars, and ultimately pave the way to the clinic.
