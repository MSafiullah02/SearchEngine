            "text": "A registry of 1099 cases with COVID-19 reported a higher prevalence of hypertension (23.7% vs. 13.4%) and coronary artery disease (5.8% vs. 1.8%) in severely affected versus non-severely affected patients.4 Another study, of 138 hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients. Higher rates of hypertension (58.3% vs. 21.6%, p <0.001) and cardiovascular disease (25.0% vs. 10.8%, p=0.04) were observed in ICU patients.1 This indicates that patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease may have a worse prognosis than others although age could be one of the confounders. Furthermore, it is also essential to understand that although most clinical presentations relate to the respiratory system, the disease may also impact on the cardiovascular system.5 Besides the respiratory system, ACE2 is expressed in the human cardiovascular system including the heart6 and a number of mechanisms have been put forward whereby SARS-CoV-2 may cause myocardial injury. These include mechanisms involving derangement of ACE2 signal pathways (animal studies have shown that cellular ACE2 levels decrease upon SARS-CoV infection),6 cytokine storm and myocarditis.7\n,\n8 Occurrence of myocardial involvement and severity thereof varies among affected individuals. While myocardial damage evidenced by high cardiac markers such as hs-TnI has been recognized9 and fulminant myocarditis has been reported,8 whether cardiovascular complications include malignant arrhythmias is not yet known. In the afore-mentioned study of 138 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, arrhythmia (not further specified) was reported in 17% of total patients and in 16 of 36 patients admitted to the ICU.1 Therefore, an arrhythmogenic effect of COVID-19 could be expected, potentially contributing to disease outcome. This may be of importance for patients with an increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias, either secondary to acquired conditions, co-morbidities, or consequent to inherited syndromes. Management of patients with inherited arrhythmia syndromes such as Long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, Short QT syndrome and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic may prove particularly challenging. Depending on the inherited defect involved, these patients may be susceptible to pro-arrhythmic effects of COVID-19-related issues such as fever, stress, electrolyte disturbances and use of antiviral drugs. Hence, additional precautions and preventive measures are recommended, including ECG monitoring, aggressive antipyretic treatment, and more stringent social distancing to prevent infection.10 We here describe the potential COVID-19 associated risks and therapeutic considerations for patients with distinct inherited arrhythmia syndromes and provide recommendations for their monitoring and management during this pandemic.",

            "text": "The Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterised by abnormally prolonged ventricular repolarization and an increased risk of the malignant arrhythmia Torsades de Pointes and ventricular fibrillation that may lead to sudden death. LQTS is an inheritable condition caused by pathogenic variants in genes encoding ion channels (primarily KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A). An often-faced clinical situation, however, is acquired QT-interval prolongation, that occurs for instance during myocardial ischemia, hypothermia, as a result of treatment with a wide range of drugs, hypokalaemia or sepsis. Severe QTc-prolongation due to these conditions might similarly result in malignant arrhythmias. Rather commonly, patients who have severe forms of acquired QT-prolongation also have a genetic predisposition for QTc-prolongation,11\n,\n12 but without such extreme provocation these patients generally have normal QT-intervals. In fact, many LQTS patients may also have QT-intervals within normal limits in resting conditions,13 although this still puts them at higher risk for malignant arrhythmias,14 especially during provocations such as the use of QTc-prolonging drugs.15 Whereas severe forms of inherited LQTS often surface during (early) childhood (from infants to adolescents),14\n,\n16 acquired QT-prolongation generally occurs in older patients because these critical provocative events more often occur in older patients.",

Many drugs (either with cardiac or non-cardiac indications) have the ability to block cardiac potassium currents, impairing ventricular repolarisation with subsequent prolongation of the QT-interval and an increased risk for malignant arrhythmias.15 In addition, many drugs may alter drug metabolism, e.g. due to inhibition of CYP3A4, which may further increase plasma levels of QT-prolonging drugs and further increase risk.

            "text": "Chloroquine is one of the most widely used anti-malarial drugs world-wide, but it has also been investigated as a potential broad-spectrum anti-viral drug.18 Amongst its mechanisms, chloroquine appears to interfere with the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 and may thus negatively influence virus-receptor binding and abrogate infection.19, 20, 21 However, chloroquine is closely related to quinidine, and while the latter is used as an anti-arrhythmic drug in Brugada syndrome and idiopathic forms of ventricular fibrillation, it is also well known for its QT-prolonging effects and has been associated with QT related malignant arrhythmias. Luckily, the QT-prolonging effect of chloroquine is very modest, and in general it does not result in clinically significant QT-prolongation in patients without LQTS.22 Hydroxychloroquine sulfate, a less toxic derivative of chloroquine, is widely used in the chronic treatment of autoimmune diseases without significant effects on ECG parameters,23 and was recently shown to also efficiently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro.24 However, both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are metabolised by CYP3A4, and COVID-19 treatment with (hydroxy)chloroquine can be combined with additional anti-viral treatments such as ritonavir plus lopinavir (both potent CYP3A4 inhibiting drugs; their combination is associated with QT-prolongation), azithromycin (besides a macrolide antibiotic also investigated for its antiviral properties, with also (weak) CYP3A4 inhibition and associated with QT-prolongation)25\n,\n26, or remdesivir (an investigational drug for which metabolism and possible QT prolonging effects are not yet resolved). Combining (hydroxy)chloroquine with these drugs might thus result in higher plasma levels and significant QT-prolongation. Hence, we advise monitoring QT-intervals and cardiac rhythm if starting these drugs given the increased risk for malignant arrhythmias (Figure 1\n). In addition, physicians should be aware of the alpha-blocking effects of (hydroxy)chloroquine, which might result in hypotension.",

Nevertheless, if possible, we advise (Figure 1) to monitor QT-intervals at baseline and at 4h after administration of (hydroxy)chloroquine and/or anti-viral therapy in patients with congenital or acquired LQTS, patients already taking other QT-prolonging drugs, and patients with structural heart disease or bradycardia. A second ECG is recommended after 1-3 days. In all other patients, QTc-interval monitoring should be performed 24h after start of therapy. During the course of (hydroxy)chloroquine and/or anti-viral therapy, QTc-interval monitoring is furthermore indicated in case of worsening kidney/liver function and electrolyte disorders (in particular K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+), especially in LQTS patients or patients with abnormal QT-intervals at baseline. Of particular concern is the COVID-19 associated diarrhea which may lead to hypokalemia with adverse effects on the QTc interval. In addition, beta-blocker treatment should be considered if the patient is not yet treated. Cardiologists throughout Europe, Canada and the US have initiated a QT-interval registry for COVID-19 patients treated with chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and/or anti-viral drugs and contribution is open to all.",

Up to 30% of patients with BrS carry a loss-of-function pathogenic variant (mutation) in SCN5A, the gene that encodes the cardiac sodium channel, as the pathophysiological substrate of their disease.31 The most frequently used drugs for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 patients are not on the list of drugs to be avoided by BrS patients.32 However, attention to BrS patient management is relevant in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak since ECG manifestations of the disorder may be uncovered during fever, and since fever has been unequivocally associated with life-threatening arrhythmic events (LTE) in patients with the disorder.33\n",

In a single center series of 111 patients with BrS, 22 presented with a cardiac arrest, 4 of which were fever related. Three of these 4 patients harbored a pathogenic variant in SCN5A.34 In the SABRUS registry, the percentage of SCN5A pathogenic variants was 77% in children and 27% in adults with a LTE.33 The authors also performed an analysis of all published cases (up to 2018) with fever-triggered LTE\u2019s (40 patients in 22 reports) revealed the presence of a putatively pathogenic variant in SCN5A was found in 13 (68%) of 19 patients tested.33 Moreover, in a multicenter pediatric population of 106 patients, 10 patients had a LTE during follow-up, which was triggered by fever in 27%; all of the latter patients were positive for a pathogenic SCN5A variant. Finally, preliminary data in a pediatric cohort indicated that mainly children with a SCN5A mutation developed a type 1 ECG during fever (43.8% of children who developed a type 1 ECG during fever had a SCN5A mutation vs 4.2% of children without a type 1 during fever) and had events during follow-up (7/21 vs 0/47).36 These studies collectively indicate that sodium channel function is sensitive to temperature. This sensitivity may be due to altered temperature-sensitive kinetics, in particular accelerated inactivation,37 and/or decreased sodium channel expression at higher temperatures.38 Also in other sodium channel mediated diseases, increased temperature sensitizes patients to disease-related symptoms.39\n,\n40\n",

If all ECGs show no sign of the type 1 ECG pattern, then they can go home to self-isolate.4.Patients who are not part of the higher risk group and have a drug-induced type 1 ECG pattern, no symptoms of syncope and no sign of a spontaneous type 1 pattern at any other time are at lowest risk and can afford to self-isolate at home.

The only potential deleterious pharmacological interaction in these patients are drugs with alpha or beta adrenoceptor mimetic activity, which may be used in cases in need of hemodynamic support. Intravenous epinephrine has been used to unmask ventricular arrhythmias and initial data suggested that epinephrine was more effective than exercise testing in unmasking ventricular arrhythmias.49 Later studies revealed, however, a low sensitivity and high specificity (with the exercise test as the gold standard50). Nevertheless, based on their pathophysiological mechanism of action, epinephrine, isoproterenol and dobutamine, all alpha and/or B1 receptor agonists, should probably be avoided. Milrinone, the most widely used phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor, acts by decreasing the degradation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This may potentially stimulate the RyR2 receptor and must thus be used with caution. However, with continuation of the beta blockers (as we recommend, see below) this may not be that relevant because betablockers suppress milrinone-induced increased Ca-leak.51 CPVT patients, in particular those who were symptomatic prior to diagnosis, should stay on their beta blocker treatment with or without flecainide as long as is tolerated hemodynamically. Flecainide does have interactions with Ritonavir/Lopinavir and chloroquine, yet we believe that it is an important enough therapy not to stop in these particularly stressful circumstances.",
