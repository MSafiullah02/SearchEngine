            "text": "Despite their limited genetic repertoires and typically specific host tropisms, viruses have a remarkable ability to infect new, often highly unrelated host types. The incidence and spread of novel viruses in host populations is termed virus emergence. In recent years, the incidence of newly identified viruses in human populations appears to be increasing, but whether this is a consequence of improved detection or more emergence events is a topic of considerable debate.1, 2, 3 Nevertheless, there are some general patterns for virus emergence. Emergence events typically occur when novel host and reservoir populations experience significant changes in range, demographics, aggregation and dispersal behavior, contact rates, environmental and climatic conditions, or vector distributions. In humans, there appear to be several hotspots for emergence, typically regions of high human population activity and density. These emergence hotspots include the Eastern United States, Western Europe, Japan, and Southeastern Australia.3 Sources of emerging viruses tend to be phylogenetically closely related organisms. For example, zoonotic viruses of wildlife are overrepresented among the emerging human viruses.3 In addition, there is a tendency for emerging viruses to have RNA genomes.4 This pattern may be a consequence of the high evolvability of RNA viruses.5 Despite these generalities, efforts to predict potential emerging viruses have not progressed as fast as hoped.",

            "text": "Mechanistically, virus emergence is a three\u2010step process. In the first step, a virus acquires the ability to infect new host cells. The second step consists of virus adaption to the novel host such that transmission between hosts is facilitated. Finally, to achieve full emergence, the virus gains the ability to spread epidemically through the host population. While the first two steps entail genetic changes in the virus, the third step may require changes on the part of the vector or host populations, such as through increased contact rates, range changes, or other ecological or environmental shifts.6 Virus emergence is, therefore, by definition, an eco\u2010evolutionary process.7 In this review, I address our current understanding of the evolutionary ecology of virus emergence, highlight new approaches to its study, and assess the future prospects for the management of risks associated with pandemic infectious viruses. Examples selected to illustrate basic concepts tend to come from medically and agriculturally important viruses, primarily because these viruses are the best studied (Table 1). However, it should be noted that virus emergence is a biologically universal phenomenon and occurs across all phyla. A major future challenge is to broaden our perspective of emerging viruses to include bacterial, archaeal, fungal, and invertebrate viruses.",

In many cases, changes in cell tropism can be accomplished through a few (or even one) nucleotide substitutions.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 A typical example is provided by the alphaviruses, a group of 29 nonsegmented, positive\u2010sense, single\u2010stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses mainly vectored by mosquitoes.18, 19 Examples of alphaviruses include Eastern equine encephalitis virus, chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Ross River virus, and Sindbis virus. Despite the striking architectural similarities among the different strains, these viruses can infect an exceptionally broad range of hosts, including mammals, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and insects.18, 19 Emergence events can result in hundreds of thousands of human infections.20, 21 The molecular basis of this broad host range stems from the malleability of the alphavirus host attachment protein, the E2 envelope glycoprotein, and its ability to bind the highly conserved laminin receptor.",

Furthermore, alphavirus host shifts may be facilitated by the indispensability and lack of structural flexibility of the highly conserved laminin receptor.39, 40 The E2 host receptor binding site has likely been shaped by natural selection for flexibility to bind different host laminin receptors, providing alphaviruses with the ability to shift hosts easily.",

By contrast, human IAVs prefer sialic acids with \u03b12,6\u2010linkages.61 As few as one or two mutations in hemagglutinin can significantly alter binding avidity to favor either human or avian sialic acids.62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73 Several studies have suggested that subtle changes in the electrostatic properties of the virus host receptor domain and increased opportunities for hydrogen bonding with complementary domains on host sialic acids permit host range expansion.61, 62, 63, 64, 65 Crucially, mutations permitting binding to human receptors do not preclude binding to avian receptors, and vice versa, although binding affinities are typically reduced.61, 68, 71, 72, 73 The ability to bind both human and avian receptors allows the possibility that a broad host range virus could be amplified in one host while periodically infecting the other in what is described in ecological theory as a source\u2013sink scenario,74, 75 Source\u2013sink evolution and its relevance to viral ecology will be discussed later in this paper.",

In one study of cauliflower mosaic virus, 53.8% of the genomes recovered after a single passage were recombinants.89 In the brome mosaic virus, practically every virus is a recombinant.90 Nonreplicative recombination uses enzyme\u2010mediated breakage\u2010repair mechanisms, similar to DNA\u2010based genomes.91 Thus, the function(s) of recombination in DNA viruses may be similar to the hypothesized functions of recombination in other clonal organisms. That is, recombination in DNA viruses may serve to repair DNA, remove mutations, break down linkage disequilibrium, and maintain genome integrity.92 Moreover, recombination may allow viruses to capture and use host\u2010encoded genes to manipulate hosts and increase infectivity (Fig. 2).93 For example, the Epstein\u2013Barr herpesvirus likely acquired, via recombination, a homolog of human interleukin\u201010, called BRCFI.

However, in other cases, the rarity of recombination may have more to do virus and host life history. For example, recombination has not been observed among the tick\u2010borne flaviviruses. Ticks usually feed once during each life history stage (as larva, nymph, and adult). Therefore, the likelihood of an infected tick feeding on a host infected by a different virus strain is low.

In other words, host specialization is caused by the absence of selection in favor of maintaining host generalism. If there are no alternative hosts for a virus in a particular habitat, then the virus will adapt to the currently available host (i.e., specialize). During the process of adaptation to a single host, mutations are fixed that are either beneficial or neutral to the present host but are deleterious to the alternate host.

In its native range, BTV is vectored by Culicoides imicola midges.209 In recent years, a sub\u2010Saharan strain of the virus expanded northward from Africa, first to Southern and Eastern Europe and then into Northern and Western Europe, leading to widespread mortality among livestock.209 Changes in climate have been implicated as a major driver in the expansion of BTV's range.210 The most compelling evidence supporting this hypothesis is the observation of BTV and C. imicola in regions that have warmed the most since the 1990s, but not in regions that stayed cool during this period.210\n",

The Peromyscus population surge was linked to the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation event of 1992, which resulted in increased temperatures and precipitation in the region during the fall, winter, and spring of 1992\u20131993.219 The outcome was a trophic cascade. The increased precipitation recharged the thirsty soil and increased primary production. More plants led to increased rodent forage, such as seeds, berries, nuts, and insects. Improved forage augmented rodent survival and reproductive output. Greater rodent densities led to increased contact rates among rodents and pushed them to their range margins, such as human dwellings. The higher rodent densities likely facilitated increased SNV infection rates, triggering spillover infections in consanguineous human populations.219\n",

While the specific mechanism of Andes virus human\u2010to\u2010human transmission has not been established, some evidence suggests that close exposure among sex partners and family members may be responsible.226 It stands to reason that hantaviruses may be optimized for indirect transmission but can gain the ability to be spread by bodily contact, as the Andes virus may have done.
