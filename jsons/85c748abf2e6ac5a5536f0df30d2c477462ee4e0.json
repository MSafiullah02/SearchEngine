Patients' characteristics, the severity of infection and host reaction all participate in the development of cardiac complications 10 . Direct damage by virus, systemic inflammatory responses and instability of coronary plaque and hypoxia have been proposed as possible mechanisms 2 (See Figure 1). Direct pathogen invasion in severe pneumonia patients has been confirmed. In patients with severe pneumococcal, S. pneumonia was detected in the myocardium, leading to cardiac injury and local proinflammatory responses 30 . And SARS-CoV was detected in 35% of patients with SARS, which suggested the possibility of direct damage to cardiomyocytes by the virus 31 .
