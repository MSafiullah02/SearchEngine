The arrival of the hybridoma technology (K\u00f6hler and Milstein, 1975) brought a new level of therapeutic potential to the use of the immune mechanisms, with monoclonal antibodies being widely recognized as potential \u201cmagic bullets\u201d. However, when monoclonal antibodies were found to be effective in vitro, their xenogenic (murine) nature led to the development human anti-mouse-antibody responses in patients (Borrebaeck et al., 1993; Khazaeli et al., 1994), often precluding repeat treatments. Only, after the development of approaches (recently reviewed in Vaughan et al., 1998) permitting the production of monoclonal antibodies that are (or appear) human, could the clinical benefits of these agents be fully realized.",

However, even with improvements in culture technology and fermentation scale-up, costs of purified antibodies in the range of 1000 to 2000 US$/g (at 10,000 liter fermentation scale) are not uncommon with higher costs for smaller fermentation scale (Werner, 1998). Alternative systems are being developed, with the objective of lowering capital investments and cost of goods associated with large scale production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies. These include microbial and insect cell-based (recently reviewed in Verma et al., 1998), plant-based (reviewed in Larrick et al., 1998), as well as transgenic animal-based production systems. This review will focus on the production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies in the milk of transgenic animals, summarizing the status of the technology and examining potential advantages and challenges.",

Following integration into the germline, the mammary gland-specific transgene is transmitted in Mendelian fashion and, if expressed, becomes a dominant genetic characteristic that will be predictably inherited by offspring of the founder animal.

            "text": "Transgenes targeting the expression of recombinant proteins to the mammary gland are usually chimeric, being derived from the fusion of the gene encoding the protein(s) of interest with mammary-specific regulatory sequences (Fig. 2). Regulatory sequences from several milk-specific genes have been isolated and used first in transgenic mice, then in large animals. Most of this work has been carried out with: the ovine \u03b2-lactoglobulin gene, rodent (mouse, rat and rabbit) whey acid protein (WAP) genes, bovine \u03b1-lactalbumin and \u03b1-s1-casein genes, as well as the caprine \u03b2-casein gene (reviewed in Maga and Murray, 1995; Echelard, 1996; Meade et al., 1998). According to the regulatory sequences employed, variable levels of expression for the protein of interest were observed. For example, using the human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) cDNA only low level (\u03bcg/ml) expression was observed with transgenic rabbits and mice when using a construct containing 1.6 kb of bovine \u03b1-s1-casein 5\u2032-flanking sequences (Riego et al., 1993), whereas the human tPA cDNA under the control of caprine \u03b2-casein sequences was expressed at high levels in transgenic goat's milk (>1 mg/ml; Ebert et al., 1991, Ebert et al., 1994). Recombinant protein expression will vary according to the nature and size of the mammary gland regulatory elements as well as the nature (cDNA or genomic) and sequence of the expressed gene. Usually genomic transgenes are expressed at higher levels than cDNA transgenes (Whitelaw et al., 1991; Hurwitz et al., 1994). However, systematic studies comparing side by side the expression of cDNA and genomic antibody transgenes in milk have not been published.",

The choice of animal to employ for transgenic expression is determined by the amount of protein needed as well as reproductive characteristics. Transgenic mice represent an ideal system to test expression constructs prior or concomitant to the generation of larger founder transgenic animal. Fortunately, the milk promoter sequences from all mammals tested are capable of expression in the mouse mammary gland. This allows the relatively inexpensive and rapid testing and optimization of the transgene constructs. If expression of the transgene by the mammary gland is deleterious to the health of the animal, it will be often evident in the mouse model (Devinoy et al., 1994; Korhonen et al., 1997). However, the very limited murine milk yield restricts expression of recombinant proteins to milligram quantities.",

However, their labor-intensive milking and high husbandry costs preclude using rabbits for the production of kilograms of therapeutic antibodies. To this end, dairy goats are ideal. The average milk output per doe is 600 to 800 liters per 300-day lactation, although yields greater than 1000 liters per lactation have been recorded. Recombinant antibody concentration in milk in the range between 1 and 5 g/l has been reproducibly achieved by this group. In these conditions, herds of transgenic goats of manageable size could easily yield 1 to 300 kg of purified product per year. This represents the low to middle range of the high-volume protein category that would be required for the majority of therapeutic antibodies currently under development.",

Generally, fertilized eggs are flushed from the oviduct of superovulated donors, microinjected with a few hundred copies of the transgene, transferred to the uterus or oviduct of pseudopregnant recipients (following more or less extensive culture in vitro), and developed to term. In cattle, one cell stage embryos generated from in vitro matured and in vitro fertilized slaughterhouse-derived oocytes can also be used.",

Transgenic animals were generated by co-microinjection of the milk expression constructs (Fig. 2). Twenty double transgenic mouse lines were generated, carrying both the heavy and light chain transgenes. Antibody expression up to 4 mg/ml was detected in transgenic mouse milk. A total of five transgenic goat lines was also generated by co-microinjection (Gavin et al., 1997), three of which carried both transgenes (one male and two female founders). Expression up to 14 g/l has been recorded in the milk of one of the female founders. High-level expression (5 g/l) was also observed from female offspring of the male founder. The other female founder only produced low-levels (0.1 g/l) of the antibody (D. Pollock et al., in preparation). It was also shown that the milk produced hBR96-2 antibody has retained full antigen binding properties (Perry Fell, personal communication).",

However, there is very little evidence suggesting that differences in glycosylation resulting from expression in different mammalian host cells significantly influence the behavior of recombinant antibodies (Bebbington, 1995).
