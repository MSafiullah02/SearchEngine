The codon usage was optimized according to Escherichia coli expression preferences. HR1 and HR2 were connected by an eight amino acid linker (GGSGGSGG, single letter abbreviation of amino acids) and a 6-His tag was introduced by PCR primers at the C-terminus to facilitate the protein purification. The choice of the eight amino acids as linker was based on our previous successful work on other viral fusion core [15], [16], [17]. The constructs were cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites (introduced by synthetic PCR primers) of pET22b expression vector (Novagen). Under this construction strategy, two extra amino acids were created between the C-terminal end of the HR2 and 6-His tag. They are \u201cLeu\u2013Glu\u201d for XhoI restriction cloning site (CTCGAG for nucleotides). This construct was named as MHV 2-helix (Fig. 1). The construction was verified by direct DNA sequencing.",

In comparison, the computed molecular mass of 2-helix (with 6\u00d7 Histidine) is about 13 kDa, which indicates that the 2-helix might form oligomers (about 40 kDa). MALDI-TOFF results showed that the 2-helix monomer is about 12.6 kDa with two possible charges (Fig. 4\nA). Subsequently, chemical cross-linking demonstrated that the 2-helix protein oligomer was, in fact, a trimer (Fig. 5\n) from the estimated molecular mass of the cross-linked products. In addition, the content of trimer increased with the concentration increase of the chemical cross-linker. Clear trimer band with monomer could also be seen if the samples (reduced by SDS loading buffer) were not heated at 100 \u00b0C (Lane 2 in Fig. 5A). All this indicates that the 2-helix protein forms a stable trimeric complex.",
