Faced with the consequences of inaction, most national governments responded with policies that restricted the activities conducted by their inhabitants. As schools and businesses shuttered, the mobility of these people decreased. This reduction in mobility, and related activities, was recorded through ubiquitous location-enabled personal mobile devices. Patterns emerged that varied by place-based activity. In this work the differences in these place-based activity patterns are investigated across nations, specifically focusing on the relationship between government enacted policies and changes in community activity patterns. We show that people's activity response to government action varies widely both across nations as well as regionally within them. Three assessment measures are devised and the results correlate with a number of global indices. We discuss these findings and the relationship between government action and residents' response.",

In late 2019, the disease was identified in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the globe [1] . Nations responded in a variety of ways as cases of the disease increased dramatically within their populations. Some governments responded immediately, severely restricting residents' mobility and pausing most economic activity [2] while others chose to implement less restrictive policies [3] . Across the globe, borders began to close and many national governments chose to close schools and businesses, essentially shutting down local economies, while others limited their response to simple physical distancing practices [4] . The speed at which countries responded to this pandemic also varied drastically with some governments taking action within days of their first confirmed cases, and others waiting to implement public health policies until a pattern could be identified. Still other governments have yet to instrument meaningful COVID-19-related policy choosing instead to make an argument for \"herd immunity\" [5] .",

People look to their government for information on the severity and spread of the disease and rely on what they are told to make informed decisions on how to act. For most, government enacted policies dictate how they will conduct their daily affairs during a global health emergency. As officials around the world began to cancel public events and limit public transit options, inhabitants were forced to respond by limiting their mobility and changing their activity behavior. A decade ago, this change in community mobility would have been measured at a large scale through survey samples of the population. Today, however, this change in activity behavior is being monitored and recorded in real-time through context-aware technology. The ubiquity of location-enabled mobile devices means that mobile device manufacturers (e.g., Apple, Google) and data providers (e.g., Verizon, Deutsche Telekom) have unlocked access to the mobility activity of people around the planet to a degree previously unattainable.",

Similar results have been released by the Descartes Lab, an analytics company, for counties in the United States [7] . Aside from purely spatial movement data, other companies have focused on discrete places, using location-enabled mobile device data to identify the types of places (e.g., Bank, Grocery Store, Restaurant) people visit, and how their visiting behavior has changed over the past few months. For instance, Foursquare [8] has demonstrated the impact of COVID-19 on place-based social media check-ins within the United States 1 and SafeGraph [9] is publishing similar data based on a panel of location-based mobile surveys.",

In this work, we are interested in how the residents of different countries respond to their government's policies related to COVID-19, therefore identifying the place-based activity responses of people from a range of countries is essential. With this goal in mind, we make use of the Google Community Mobility Dataset. This dataset is an aggregate of the place-based activity behavior of millions of individuals as collected through their location-enabled mobile devices. If a mobile device user has Google Location Services enabled (required when using the Google Maps application), their location data is anonymously collected, aggregated with other users across a region (e.g., Country or District), and reported in one of six place type categories. Further information on these categories is discussed in Section 3.1. Not only are these data based on one of the most widely used location-based services on the planet, but the data is also passively collected thus reducing the bias of the mobility patterns, as compared to active collection such as surveys or \"check-ins\" [10] . For the purposes of this research, this data is an ideal representation of activity response to the COVID-19 pandemic and forms the foundation on which we conduct our analysis.",

[11] studied the correlation between real-time mobility data from the internet service company Baidu and the spread of the disease in Wuhan, China. The authors found that once the national government established control measures, the correlation decreased substantially. Further work on the transmission rate of the disease found that travel restrictions enacted by the government delayed the epidemic progression by 3-5 days within China, but significantly slowed the spread elsewhere in the world [12] pointing to the global impacts of the policy actions taken by a single country. Much of the response research being conducted on COVID-19 is still in its infancy, but we can look to other recent global events to understand how nations and their people respond. There is an existing body of literature exploring the impact of natural disasters [13] , terrorism [14] , and economic crises [15] on human mobility and activity patterns. Most of these studies define human mobility at the scale of migration between localized regions and little research has explored the day-to-day impact on the mobility of individuals or groups at a multi-national level, brought about by a global crisis.",

Other efforts have investigated the relationship between political views and compliance with government policy [25, 26] . U.S.-focused research has also demonstrated that government policy that limits every day life has been shown to be having an impact on many sectors of the economy [27] . A recent study of high school students suggested that school closures and concerns over COVID-19 are significantly impacting performance of students in their subject areas [28] and will continue to have a lasting impact on our education system. While limited data is available, similar educational and economic impacts are also being found outside of the United States [29] .",

A team of researchers at the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford developed a tool to track these measures and produce a response dataset 4 that allows national policy responses to be compared across a range of measures. The key product of this Coronavirus Government Response Tracker is the Stringency Index. This index is made of up 13 indicators of government response, recorded daily for 149 countries. Nine of these indicators assign an ordinal value to policy action related to school closures, travel bans, public event cancellations, etc. The other three focus on financial or monetary measures. The Stringency Index is calculated through a weighted combination of these indicators with a minimum value of 0 and maximum of 100. The index was calculated back to January 1, 2020 and through to at least April 11 (the end of our temporal analysis window). The full methodology for how this stringency index was developed is available at [35] . The dataset is currently being used in a range of preliminary COVID-19 related analysis [36, 37, 38] .",

While both cosine similarity and Pearson's correlation are fundamentally variations on the inner product, they vary based on centering. For our purposes, cosine similarity is the most appropriate method for comparing activity patterns to government policy over time due to the fact that it is not invariant to shifts, a feature that is not true for Pearson's correlation.

Three categories, Transit stations, Residential, and Retail & recreation, all report relatively high similarity and low standard deviations suggesting that these similarities are relatively consistent across all countries. The Workplace activity category clearly aligns with the stringency index though not to the same degree as the previously mentioned three. Some potential reasons for this are explored in Section 6. As expected, Parks are least similar to the stringency index, and with a high standard deviation, which indicates there is considerable variation in this mobility pattern across countries. The Grocery & pharmacy category is not as close to the stringency index with a larger standard deviation across countries than one might expect. Again, some potential reasons for this are discussed in Section 6.

Provided a cosine similarity and Pearson's correlation for each country, we computed Kendall's \u03c4 to measure concordance between the two measures.

In essence, this similarity value provides a relative indication of how a population responds to COVID-19-related policy enacted by its government.

Plots for three of the countries with the highest average similarity are shown in Figure 2 with three of the least similar shown in Figure 3 . The full rank of countries is available in the project data directory at https://platial.science/covid19code. Visually we see a high degree of similarity in the magnitude and absolute slope of the lines in these Figures, representing the actions taken by the government and the response from residents. Exploring the countries with the least similar patterns, the country with the lowest value was South Korea. Further investigation found that this is solely due to the time window of our analysis. The peak of new cases in South Korea occurred on February 29, 2020 and local health officials started testing airport staff on January 21, 2020. This is supported by the high stringency index value of 60 as it enters our analysis window on February 15th. Similarly, Japan, Taiwan, Mongolia, and Hong Kong all show high stringency indices entering our analysis window suggesting that if a substantial decrease in residents' place-based activity occurred, it likely took place prior to February 15th and adjustments from the baseline (the previous months as mentioned in the Data section) would be quite small. The first country that entered our time analysis window with a relatively stable stringency index near zero was Sweden followed closely by all other Scandinavian countries. This supports reporting by journalists and policy risk analysts that Scandinavian governments, specifically Sweden, are approaching the pandemic differently than most other countries [41, 42] .

In some instances, however, there is a delay effect between the policy enactment and the response. We might see that the slope of the stringency index suddenly increases and three days later that change is mirrored by the activity patterns. In addressing RQ3 we must first test to determine if there is a quantifiable temporal lag between government action and population response. If a lag response exists, we can then identify which countries demonstrate the smallest or largest response lags. The lag response analysis was done using a signal processing approach, calculating the crosscorrelation as a measure of displacement similarity between each place-based activity pattern and the stringency index for each country. The result is a vector containing the cross-correlation of the input vector based on lag. For example, if there is no significant lag between the stringency index and an activity pattern, the highest cross-correlation would be found at lag zero and diminish as lag increases and decrease. Should a larger number of high cross-correlation values appear in negative lag positions, this indicates that a significant change in the stringency index occurred before a significant change in the activity pattern. Given that our units are days, the lag steps are also days.",

We then subtract the number of remaining negative lag days from the number of positive lag days to produce our average lag for that activity pattern-stringency index pair. This approach is intended to be more robust than looking for the single highest cross-correlation value as it considers skewness in the lag distribution. This is a weighted approach to identifying the peak lag day as a function of all lags above the threshold avoiding an approach that ignores neighboring lag values in favor of a single peak.",

The vast majority of countries reported a negative lag response with a mean of -2.4 days. In a select few instances the lag response was positive. Most of these could be explained by significant non-COVID-19 related events. For instance, Egypt's positive lag is due to a severe weather event on March 12, 2020. Removing this event results in a lag of -4.0. The average lag time for each activity pattern was calculated across all countries and is shown in Table 2 . The high standard deviation for each of these categories speaks to the high degree of global variability in this assessment measure. The Grocery & pharmacy category reports the highest average lag time including the largest standard deviation. As many grocery stores were labeled essential services in many countries, and therefore not mandated to close, people could choose to go to a grocery store immediately, or a few days after, to stock up on supplies in response to an increase in government COVID-19 related restrictions.

Three response similarity distances are computed for each pair of country vectors. We then calculate the shortest geographic distance between each pair of countries in our dataset. 9 Using the rank correlation approach, we computed the degree to which the geometric distance correlates with each of the response similarity distances.

These values are split by continent and also reported overall within the same continent and between countries from different continents. In general, there is a slight difference between the average similarity distance between countries within the same continent and those between continents. The difference, however, is less than one might expect implying, as reported by the previous correlation values, 9 Using the PostGIS St DistanceSphere function that the spatial distribution explains little of the variability in country responses. There are, however, substantial differences between continents. For instance, the cosine similarity distance of countries within South America is quite low indicating a high degree of similarity between countries within this continent, at least as reported by their response to government policy actions. The number increases for lag response suggesting that though they responded similarly, there was greater variety in the lag response time than in Europe, for example. This pattern is repeated for Africa. The reverse, however, is true for Oceania though it must be noted that data for only three countries were used in this analysis and Papua New Guinea had a significantly different cosine similarity response than Australia and New Zealand. These numbers should be interpreted relative to one another within the same measure, not as absolute values or compared across measures. Taking a multidimensional scaling approach, we compress the cosine similarity and lag response distances (again based on vector similarity) into two dimensions in order to visually represent the similarities and differences between the countries in a 2D plot. Figure 5 shows the results of this approach with countries assigned colors based on continent. This figure nicely visualizes a few important findings. The first is that there is a large cluster of countries that are all quite similar in their place-based activity response to COVID-19 policy changes. It is difficult to single out any one specific country but we do see a mix of countries from different continents. Second, we can identify a number of countries that exist outside of the main cluster and many of these countries are from the same continent, and in some cases, the same subregion within the continent, namely Scandinavia. Last, we can observe the outliers. Our previous analysis indicated that South Korea and Japan responded very differently from many other countries, likely due to the fact that their governments responded before the temporal analysis window of our activity dataset. We also see that South Africa and Egypt presented very different responses, both of which have been mentioned in previous sections. While multidimensional scaling is a good visualization tool for displaying similarity between entities such as these, we acknowledge that it is a dimension reduction technique and so does not fully represent the nuances within the data.",

For our cosine similarity measure, those countries that shared a border reported a mean similarity distance of 0.378. Those that do not share a border reported a mean distance of 0.589. A similar difference in mean distance was found for the lag response and the subregion variation measures. In pulling apart these distance values for each country pair, we found this to be the case in most countries but with a few notable exceptions. For instance, through this approach, Germany is shown to be quite dissimilar from its neighbors based on cosine similarity, which mirrors what has been reported in the media [44, 45] . The United States and Mexico were also quite dissimilar in their responses, considerably different than the United States and Canada. The most similar countries that shared a border according to our cosine similarity measure are on the continent of South America, namely Columbia and Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru. The largest lag difference in neighboring countries was also identified in South America in Columbia and Panama, as well as Central American Honduras and El Salvador. The neighboring countries that were most similar with respect to lag response time are India and Bangladesh, with Hungary and Romania also being quite close. With respect to the subregion variation analysis, the most similar neighboring countries were Italy and France (also highly similar for cosine similarity) followed by the Czechia and Slovakia. The largest variance was also found in Europe between Italy and Slovenia as well as Switzerland and France. Figure 6 presents a visual representation of these similarities and differences through a dendrogram based on subregional variability. Again, this is a subset of all countries where Google published subregional activity patterns. One of the interesting things that this visualization shows is the degree to which Kenya and Nigeria (bottom two countries) are dissimilar from all other countries. This hierarchical clustering approach suggests that should all the countries be clustered into two groups based on their subregional variation, that Kenya and Nigeria would make up one cluster while all other countries would be in the second cluster.

Given the difference in magnitude (stringency index is out of 100, while number of cases and deaths are limited only by the population of a country), we chose to measure the rank correlation of the variables rather than the cosine similarity. As was reported in [35] , there is a strong positive correlation between cases, deaths, and the stringency index. For our purpose, however, we find that the rank correlation between the average activity pattern and either confirmed cases (\u03c4=0.610) or deaths (\u03c4=0.569), by country, is lower on average than the correlation between activity patterns and the stringency index (\u03c4=0.631).

Transit and residential-based activities were most responsive while Grocery & pharmacy and Parks showed the highest degree of variability between countries. These results were supported by the findings from RQ3, namely that there is a measurable lag between policy action and activity response. On average the lag response equated to approximately 2.4 days across countries and activity categories, but again the Grocery & pharmacy category demonstrated the highest degree of variability between countries. That this activity category would be the most volatile is reasonable in that groceries and pharmacies provide essential food and medication. While many of the activities related to the other categories could be lawfully enforced through closures, establishments offering access to essential supplies remained open, thus permitting visits and reflected through increased activity. The Workplace category, while not as volatile as the Grocery & pharmacy category also varied a bit between countries. In some countries we noticed weekly patterns in the data indicating that people were still going to work in some countries, even while the transit category remained low and residential was high. This requires further investigation but points towards the variability between country responses, equity issues, and enforcement of policies. We also identified considerable differences in lag time from country to country. Some countries, such as New Zealand reported virtually no lag between government policy and community response, whereas others, e.g., South Africa, demonstrated a substantial lag (mean 8.5 days). Of our three similarity measures, lag response time demonstrated the highest correlation with global indices including development indicators such as life expectancy, GDP, and market size.",

Using a subset of countries for which Google reports subnational activity patterns, we calculated the variability of responses for each subregion to the national government policies. We answered RQ4 by showing that there are quantifiable differences in the variability of activity responses within a country. The ranking of these countries correlated with country-level cosine similarity and lag response values suggesting that countries who's residents responded quickly and with a similar degree of magnitude to the policy actions, were also more likely to respond similarly across subregions.",

While this is a fantastic resource for researchers, very little is known about the data collection methodology, sample sizes, geolocation accuracy, etc. As researchers we are working under the assumption that the data released publicly is valid and is a representative sample of mobile device users around the world. This is a large assumption, but one we must live with given the limited availability of COVID-19 related activity data. Additional contextual factors may have played a role in assessing the similarity of activity responses as well. We know weather, for instance, affects mobility and place-based activity. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread, northern hemisphere countries were just beginning to enter Spring which itself causes a change in activity behavior. Parks are likely the category most impacted by this, but other activity categories may have been impacted. Similarly, the par-tisan politics surrounding government policies and activity responses were largely ignored in this analysis. A wide range of political hierarchies exist with many governments wielding most of the control at the national level and others delegating health-related policy to local districts and municipalities. Indices that report on the political underpinnings of a country would be useful to include in future work.",

It would be interesting to determine if residents respond to policy relaxation in similar ways.

While we are racing to coming to terms with the global impact of this crisis, it is important to investigate the early patterns emerging from the spread of this pandemic in order to help us plan for future crises or a potential second wave of this current disease. Our focus in this paper was on gaining a better understanding of the relationship between the actions taken by national governments, with respect to COVID-19-related policy, and the response of their inhabitants, specifically as it relates to their activities. We showed considerable differences exist between countries. Three approaches were used to quantify the relationship between policy and response. Though countries varied between measure, commonalities emerged. A number of the similarities and differences between countries can be explained through correlations with global indices such as market size, or life expectancy. Not surprisingly, countries that share a border were also more similar in their activity responses. As this pandemic continues to spread and we look towards an uncertain future, understanding how people respond to their government is an important step in combating this crisis.",
