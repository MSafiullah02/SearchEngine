In particular, subcompartmental localization in the Golgi apparatus is important, for example, for the order of reactions performed in glycosylation pathways or the sorting functions of SNAREs, but is currently poorly understood. Results: We assemble a dataset of type II transmembrane proteins with experimentally determined sub-Golgi localizations and use this information to develop a predictor based on the transmembrane domain of these proteins, making use of a dedicated proteinstructure based kernel in an SVM. Various applications demonstrate the power of our approach. In particular, comparison with a large set of glycan structures illustrates the applicability of our predictions on a 'glycomic' scale and demonstrates a significant correlation between sub-Golgi localization and the ordering of different steps in glycan biosynthesis.",

A predictor has been previously developed for Golgi versus post-Golgi localization, based on hydrophobicity and frequency of different residues within the TMD of type II membrane proteins (Yuan and Teasdale, 2002) . Here we develop a predictor specifically for the sub-compartments within the Golgi part of the secretion pathway: cis-, medial-and trans-Golgi and the TGN. It is known that the composition of ER, Golgi and plasmamembranes differs (Mitra et al., 2004; van Meer et al., 2008) and likewise the membrane composition of the different sub-Golgi compartments may vary; we therefore reasoned that the TMD of type II membrane proteins may contain signatures that help identify their preferred location, even though these TMD characteristics themselves may not be the single driving force that targets these proteins to their location.",

Because the available amount of type II transmembrane proteins with known sub-Golgi localization is small, we followed an innovative approach where we use additional homologous sequences in the training set of our predictor. As prediction algorithm we chose the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm which can incorporate sequence information via the kernel function. A variety of string-based kernel functions exist, ranging from bag-of-words kernels (mainly useful for document classification) to dedicated kernels for protein sequence analysis, most notably substring spectrum kernels (which count the occurrence of substrings) and variations e.g. including gaps (Lodhi et al., 2002) . We tailor the definition of the kernel such that it fits the nature of our biological problem, i.e. prediction based on TMD sequence. Since the TMD has a well-defined alpha-helical structure it is rational to take this into account when defining a kernel. This approach is an example of applying structure-based features in kernel functions, which to our knowledge has not previously been explored in depth. Our results show that this approach indeed can be used to predict sub-Golgi localization, and we provide several examples of valuable applications of our predictions.",

Because our main interest for sub-Golgi localization prediction is related to type II transmembrane proteins, a first filtering step was to apply transmembrane (TM) helix prediction to these sequences using TMHMM (Krogh et al., 2001) . Only sequences predicted to be of the type II transmembrane signature (i.e. with exactly one TM helix predicted and of 'N-term in / TM / C-term out' topology) were retained. Since the number of type II transmembrane proteins with experimentally verified sub-Golgi localization information is rather small, no distinction was made between different species. Subsequently, these sequences were aligned with Muscle (Edgar, 2004) and clustered based on sequence identity, in order to prepare a nonredundant dataset for training and testing. Clustering was performed using the minimum variance method implemented in the R function hclust (Murtagh, 1983) . The number of clusters was selected by assessing the inter-cluster sequence identity, which was found to rise sharply above 31 clusters.",

We took as a starting point the conjoint triad string kernel, as recently proposed in the context of protein interaction prediction (Shen et al., 2007) . To adapt this to the biological problem at hand, we reasoned that in addition to sequential triplets, triplets consisting of residues with a fixed linear spacing between one another might be important, because this determines alignment of such triplets to specific sides of the transmembrane helix. Thus, we redefined triads to accommodate a fixed spacing of either 0 (the original triad definition) or 1, 2 or 3 (non-sequential triads). 3D-structure based triads: Because the results of applying the above defined string-based kernels indicated the importance of taking into account structural features of the TMD (see Results), a final kernel was designed based on observed residue-residue contacts in 3D models of the TMD helix. These models were obtained by carrying out structure calculations in CNS (Brunger et al., 1998) . CNS topologies were generated with the CNS script generate_seq.inp. Dihedral angle restraints were defined for backbone angles phi, \u221265\u02da\u00b1 20\u02daand psi \u221240\u02da\u00b1 20\u02da, respectively, and hydrogen bond restraints were defined between each O(i)-N(i+4) pair (lower and upper bound 2.3 and 3.5 \u00c5, respectively) and O(i)-HN(i+4) pair (lower and upper bound 1.7 and 2.5 \u00c5, respectively). The anneal.inp CNS-script was used, which applies a high-temperature torsion-angle dynamics phase (1000 steps of 15 fs integration time step at 50 000K) followed by a torsion angle dynamics cooling phase from 50 000K to 0K (1000 steps of 15 fs) and a second cartesian dynamics cooling phase from 2000K to 0K (3000 steps of 5 fs). Ten structures were calculated for each TMD and sorted according to the total energy, and the lowest energy structure was used to obtain the kernelfeatures. Side-chain-side-chain contacts were counted using a distance cutoff of 3.5\u00c5 and each triplet of amino acids within this distance cutoff was counted as one occurrence of a triad, again using the amino acid grouping defined above. No sequential spacing effects were applied a priori in this case.",

Using the observed string-or structure-based triads, for each type of triad v i (i ranging from 1 to 343 in the case of the grouping of the amino acids into 7 groups) a normalized count was defined as d i =(f i \u2212min)/max, where f i is the raw count and min (max) is the minimum (maximum) over all f i . Since the number of training examples was relatively small compared to the dimension of the feature space, a linear kernel was expected to be powerful enough. Leave-one-out cross validation was applied to optimize the parameter C (trade-off between training error and margin), for which a grid [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30] was used. For the sake of completeness, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel was also tested, where the additional \u03b3 parameter was optimized on a grid [500,200,100,50,10,5,1,0.1,0.01,0.001,0.0005,0.0001]. To obtain an unbiased performance estimation, an independent 'leave-one-out' loop, following the nested cross-validation setup, as described previously, was used (Varma and Simon, 2006) . Note that this setup avoids erroneously optimistic estimates obtained by simply using cross-validation to optimize the SVM parameters. The 'leave-one-out' was performed cluster-wise, meaning that all sequences in one cluster were removed simultaneously. (Yoshizawa et al., 2006) ",

The penalty score for each structure was normalized using the total number of edge-pairs, giving a value between 0.0 and 1.0.

Figure 1A shows the intercluster sequence identity as a function of the number of clusters; based on this analysis 31 clusters were selected (Table 2 and  Supplementary Table S1 ), because the maximum similarity between clusters rises sharply when using more clusters. The number of clusters with cis, medial, trans and TGN localization was 12, 6, 4 and 9, respectively (Fig. 1B) . Of the 31 clusters, 18 clusters had only one entry and 13 clusters had multiple entries with consistent localization, indicating that within these limited sets the available data is consistent.

This particular ordering was chosen because cis and TGN are the locations with the highest number of cases, and this ordering coincides with the biologically relevant order cis\u2212medial\u2212trans\u2212TGN. In addition, it requires only three separate predictors, in contrast to the approach of testing each location separately versus the other locations. The cis/medial versus trans/TGN predictor was used to test the performance of the various string kernels. Importantly, the error estimates that we provide are based on a nested cross-validation for the SVM parameter optimization, which precludes over-optimistic estimates based on a 'single' cross-validation-based optimization. As shown in Table 3 , the highest accuracies were obtained for the linear string kernel using triads with a spacing of 3 or 2 between the subsequent residues in the triad (69 and 73%, respectively). Notably, this spacing coincides with the average rise in one helical turn, which is 3.6 amino acid (spacing of 2.6). In Figure 3 , we illustrate the relation between the best performing kernel and the structure of an \u03b1-helical TMD region, by indicating for a helical structure some triplets based on a spacing of 2 for which the constituent residues are indeed proximal in 3D space. Because the linear kernels suggested a relationship between amino acids on the same face of the \u03b1-helical TMD, we also defined a kernel based purely on observed side-chain-side-chain contacts in modeled structures of the TMD regions. Figure 4 illustrates how the features for this kernel were obtained. This final predictor improved overall performance to 76%, while in comparison to the string kernels its accuracy was also more balanced in the sense that accuracy for cis/medial and for trans/TGN was comparable (Table 3 ). Importantly, we tested that this spatial structure-based kernel captures more than only linear sequence similarity by analyzing a simple predictor based on sequence identity Sequence-based kernels are designated by the spacing used to defined the triads (0-3); the structure-based kernel is defined using observed contacts in modeled transmembrane helices (see Methods for details). Accuracies are reported for cis/medial, trans/TGN and for all sequences.",

In addition, differences between ortholog pairs were 'intermediate' in the sense that in only 7 of the mismatch cases one of the pair was predicted 'cis' and the other 'trans' or 'TGN'. Most mismatches involved directly adjacent compartments, e.g. 'cis' was mostly mixed with 'medial' and not with 'trans'. Of course, not all cases where the prediction was consistent over the two of a pair are necessarily correct, but because functional differences between orthologous human and mouse glycosyltransferases can be expected to be small, it is reassuring that the predictor is reasonably consistent; the 30% inconsistent predictions would be expected to reflect the error rate of the predictor. Importantly, comparison with a simple sequence-similarity-based predictor again showed that this is not trivial: when for each mouse sequence a prediction is obtained by looking for the human TMD with the highest sequence identity, in only 23% of the cases this is identical to the prediction for the real human ortholog of that mouse sequence.

The link between the glycan structures and the predictor is formed by 'reaction patterns' that reflect the substrate specificity of glycosyltransferases which can be mapped onto the glycans. Sequences and reaction patterns were obtained as described previously (Kawano et al., 2005) and after filtering with TMHMM and WoLF PSORT 37 enzymes remained. Out of 10460 glycan structures, we could analyze 3651 with at least one pair of connected edges that both were associated with one of the 37 enzymes. Our assumption then was that the observed order of synthesis of the glycan (subsequent addition of monosaccharide units) should match the predicted localization of the glycosyltransferases involved. A penalty score was calculated for each glycan to reflect whether the predicted ordering of those enzymes indeed matches the ordering observed in the structure (with value 0.0 for perfect ordering throughout the structure and 1.0 for consistent wrong ordering). The average penalty score of the predicted localizations (0.116) was much lower than the A total of 91 out of 100 random location assignments gave a higher average penalty score than the actual predictions, indicating that with p \u223c0.1 our predictions matched better to the observed glycan structures in KEGG. Note that simplifications in our approach are that edges are only considered pairwise, and that we do not explicitly deal with retrograde Golgi-transport. Figure 5 shows the observed average penalty scores for random location assignments and for our predictor. In addition, two examples of predictions are shown, one with low and one with high penalty score. We also assessed for each of the enzymes whether it consistently was found in pairs of correctly ordered edges. For 24 out of 37, this was the case, giving an accuracy estimate of 65% which is close to the 61% found by cross-validation. Only in 8 of the 100 random trials the number of consistently correctly ordered enzymes is higher than 24, and on average this number is only 17 (+/\u22125). Note that the penalty score reflects both the accuracy of our predicted localizations and the more general fact of how well the glycan structures reflect the specific ordering of synthesis steps. Thus, our results here both provide additional validation for our sub-Golgi localization predictions as well as additional evidence for an 'assembly line' concept of glycan biosynthesis.",

However, the form of the linear sequence-based kernel function that gave best prediction results coincided with predicted properties of the TMD in its \u03b1-helical conformation, where residues separated in sequence by 2-3 amino acids are proximal in 3D space.

In particular, it is difficult to give a precise estimate of its predictive performance. For this reason, our work is best seen as the first of a kind, providing directions for further research. Extending the dataset would enable further analysis aimed at understanding the mechanism behind sub-Golgi localization. Our current results already indicate that the transmembrane domain contains information that is not captured simply by sequence similarity, but by using a larger dataset it might be possible to directly extract those features that are most important for the localization. This could be performed using feature-selection algorithms (Saeys et al., 2007) and might result in insight into the roles of, for example, specific protein-lipid or protein-protein interaction sites. One would also expect that the current analysis, which only focuses on the TMD, is related to the stability of type II transmembrane proteins within their correct membrane environment, whereas analysis of, for example, the cytoplasmic N-terminal region might result in further understanding of the localization mechanism itself.",

Here, we already showed that there is a significant correlation between localization and ordering of the different steps in glycan biosynthesis.
