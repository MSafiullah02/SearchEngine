Nonurgent or nonemergent procedures should be postponed to a later date. Clinic visits and in-person cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) checks should be converted to telehealth and remote checks whenever feasible. Minimizing fellow trainee contact with patients may include rotation of days involved in direct patient service, managing remote checks, and conducting patient telehealth visits. Attempts should be similarly made to limit exposure of electrophysiology allied professionals, including nurses, device clinic personnel, hospital administrators, and medical device company representatives. Additional steps may need to be taken to minimize exposure for higher risk individuals (eg, >60 years of age, pregnant, immunocompromised, and other comorbid conditions).",

Improved understanding of this is critical, primarily in guiding the need for additional arrhythmia monitoring (eg, mobile cardiac telemetry) after discharge and whether an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or wearable cardioverter-defibrillator will be needed in those with impaired left ventricular function thought to be secondary to COVID-19.",

Close coordination between anesthesia and the electrophysiology laboratory teams is required. For general anesthesia cases, consideration should be given to elective intubation in the intensive care unit or a negative-pressure room before entering the electrophysiology laboratory. Because the care team is restricted to the laboratory or procedure room until the procedure has finished, staff should pay particular attention to having all supplies and equipment in the room at the start of the case. Consideration can also be given to performing procedures on patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in a negative-pressure operating room.12",

Similarly, many of the clinic follow-ups and some new consults can be performed through telehealth, leveraging electronic medical record data and obtaining vital signs and ECG tracings by using digital wearables where available. As the number of application-based technologies evolves, they will continue to be an integral part of telehealth. Examples of low-risk patients for whom in-person visits could be deferred include asymptomatic patients with satisfactory CIED battery longevity, patients who are not dependent on a pacemaker, and patients who have primary prevention ICDs without symptoms suggesting worsening of heart failure or arrhythmia burden. Patients on antiarrhythmic drugs, such as dofetilide, that require QTc and laboratory monitoring may need to defer testing if prior values and their clinical condition have remained stable and if no new drugs that may prolong the QTc have been added. Patients with borderline values may need continued access to ECGs and laboratory testing. Although several studies have evaluated the use of mobile ECG devices for QTc monitoring, none of the currently available single- and 6-lead mobile ECG devices have been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration for such purposes.
