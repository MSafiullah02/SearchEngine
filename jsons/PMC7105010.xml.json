Transmission may be from consumption of contaminated food by bats secretion, or contact with infected pigs. Another way can be human-to-human spread. Since 1998 there have been several cases of infections in Bangladesh and India [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. The case-fatality varies from 40% to 70% depending on whether encephalitic or severe manifestations are noted and whether adequate healthcare facilities are available. At present there is no antiviral drug available for Nipah virus disease and the treatment is supportive. Ribavirin has been used in few patients but its efficacy for Nipah virus disease has not yet been determined. Because of the lack of effective vaccines or therapies and the fact that NiV can infects animals such as pigs, NiV infection can be considered an emerging disease and a public health issue [12], [14].",

            "text": "Evolutionary analysis, over the last three decades, has increasingly been applied to the study of microbial pathogens. Phylogenetic and phylodinamic analysis are the fundamental tools to investigate how the genealogy of a pathogen population is influenced by the interaction between pathogen's demographic history and environmental, ecological and host immunological factors [19], [20]. Phylogenetics and phylodinamics are a branch of molecular biology evaluating taxonomy and species evolution [21]. These methodologies are used as a complement to the \u2018classical epidemiology\u2019 [22] and represent powerful tools widely used to analyze epidemics especially, in particular settings such as in case of nosocomial outbreaks. By phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis, factors contributing to the evolution of novel and emerging microbial variants can be identified. In recent years, a number of methods that infer phylogenetic trees based on genetic distances, evolutionary parsimony, Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian theory, have been introduced [23], [24], [25], [26]. Genetic distances and phylogenetic trees (coupled with a correct epidemiological design i.e., cross sectional studies), inferred via different sequence evolutionary models and model selection criteria, are normally used to assign the genotype [27]. Coalescent theory and the molecular clock hypothesis are instead used to study the ancestral relationships of individuals sampled from a population (i.e., longitudinal studies) which can be inferred from a gene genealogy (phylogenetic tree) [22], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32].",

The isolates from the south had identical sequences to those detected from human infections, which confirmed that infections occurred in humans during the southern outbreak originated from infected pigs. This finding implied that the 1998 Malaysia outbreak was probably due at least to two different origins of Nipah virus infections [37]. The genome of NiV from the outbreak of Bangladesh was 6 nucleotide longer than the prototype Malaysian strain and the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this virus should represent a new strain of NiV, strictly correlated to the Malaysian strain, but exhibiting a higher interstrain nucleotide heterogeneity [38]. These findings could suggest differences in the way of transmission of the virus between the two countries: in Malaysia, the phylogenetic analysis suggested that at least two introductions of NiV into pigs have been occurred, whereas in Bangladesh the sequence heterogeneity observed should indicate multiple introductions of the virus in humans from different colonies of fruit bats. From this study emerged that NiV circulating in different areas have specific genetic characteristics and may have coevolved with the local natural reservoirs. This coevolution was further supported by Halpin et al. in 2007. These authors demonstrated the phylogenetic relationship between bats and their associated virus suggesting an important role of bats as the reservoir hosts of newly emergent viruses, such as Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses [39].",

For the first time, these authors demonstrated, using the time-scaled phylogenetic analysis, with the root of the tree originated in 1947 when the virus entered in south eastern Asiatic regions. At the phylogenetic analysis the nucleocapsid gene sequences segregated in two main clades, indicating two different introductions: one in 1995 corresponding and the other in 1985. The phylogeographic reconstruction indicated that the epidemic followed two different routes spreading to the other locations facilitated by bats of the Pteropus genus that are able to travel to long distances. The molecular evolutionary approach was used by these authors to investigate also the presence of sites under positive and negative selection, using a selective pressure analysis method [43]. Only negatively selected sites were detected confirming the stability of the viral protein studied. Interestingly, some of these negatively selected sites were found in positions previously described as important interaction sites [44]. Even if a large proportion of amino acids are invariable, the occurrence of adaptive at certain sites of the genome, over the time, cannot be excluded, especially if infected pigs trade and bats migration are not adequately monitored. This situation is in analogy with Chikungunya virus where only one nutation determined a change of vector from Aedes aegypti to Aedes albopictus\n[45].",

The phylogenetic analyses unequivocally showed that NiV P. vampyrus forms a monophyletic clade with other NiV isolates from Malaysia, but it differs from human, pig, and Pteropus hypomelanus bat isolates. When 56 NiV sequences from Pteropus lylei bats isolated in Thailand were included, NiV P. vampyrus phylogenetically grouped most closely with NiV P. lylei, and the monophyly of NiV sequences from Malaysia was lost. This close homology suggested that NiV is naturally transmitted between these two species. From this study, the presence of NiV diversity in isolates from P. lylei bats has also emerged.

Authors found NiV RNA in Pteropus bat thus suggesting it may be a reservoir for NiV in India. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that two phylogenetic lineages were formed for NiV sequences, one including Bangladesh and India sequences and the other Malaysia and Cambodia sequences. By phylogenetic analysis it was unmistakable confirmed that the same NiV strain circulates in India and Bangladesh and that it was different from that circulating in Malaysia and Cambodia. In the same period, a similar study was performed on free-ranging European insectivorous bats to assess the presence of paramyxovirus infection in these animals [52]. The study involved 120 deceased bats of 15 different European species. Bayesian reconstruction of phylogenetic trees was performed in concordance with the current proposals of Paramyxoviridae taxonomy. Interestingly, the phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of the first three paramyxoviruses in European insectivorous bats. The genetic distance between these three novel paramyxoviruses and the closest related member resulted higher than that observed in other members within the paramyxovirus genera. This data suggested that all three viruses might be considered as new paramyxoviruses. Since, infected bats were found in close proximity to heavily populated human areas, a potential risk for a zoonotic paramyxovirus infection in Europe cannot be excluded.",

The case-fatality varies from 40% to 70% depending on the severity of the clinical manifestations, such as encephalitis, and on the availability of adequate healthcare facilities. At present there is no antiviral drug available for Nipah virus disease and the treatment is just supportive. NiV infection can be considered an emerging disease and a public health problem [12], [13] as a consequence of the lack of effective vaccines and therapies and of the evidence that NiV can infect pigs [12], [13]. Phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses can represent very useful tools to elucidate the epidemiology and the temporal origin of this virus. Moreover, these analyses, especially the evolutionary analysis, could be advantageous to develop new therapy, vaccine and prevention strategies.",

As a consequence, the antigenic variability is possible and may play an important role in the ability of the virus to escape the host immune response [42]. On this basis, monitoring will be important to implement possible intervention strategies. In Asiatic countries, there is a close contact between animals and humans, especially in rural settings. This aspect represents a vulnerability of Asia for outbreaks caused by zoonotic infections. This vulnerability is further increased by sociocultural beliefs and weak public health infrastructure [54].",
