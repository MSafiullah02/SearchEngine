Perhaps owing to the fact that it is generally cheaper and easier to travel outside of our continent than it is inside (2) .

One in which some things that were considered impossible before will not no longer be impossible. Successful organizations adapt promptly in the face of adversity. While the post-COVID surprised and tested our health systems, post-COVID African neurosurgical education must reinvent itself and transform its potential into achievements. Resilience in this situation lies in recognizing the value of learning from those who walked the path we wish walk and using technology to our advantage. We cannot let the current crisis stifle our progression and we should not aim to return to the pre-COVID \"normalcy\". For when life gives you lemon, make lemonade!",

The lectures will be scheduled weekly and hosted on a videotelephony platform such as Skype (Skype Technologies, Luxembourg), Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, U.S.A.) or GoToMeeting (LogMeIn, U.S.A.). The aim of this initiative would be to improve the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of residents and young neurosurgeons in Africa. These online sessions will focus on clinical as well as non-clinical topics. Non-clinical topics will include networking, mentorship, and advice for early career neurosurgeons. In addition, the sessions will focus on research, promoting the organization of virtual scientific conferences with abstract presentations and award ceremonies. An initiative like this one can increase interregional and intraregional neurosurgical collaborations. This could in turn lead to the development of an African neurosurgical fellowship registry and research collaboration groups.",
