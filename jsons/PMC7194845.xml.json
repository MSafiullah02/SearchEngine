It is a respiratory malady causing fever, fatigue, dry cough, muscle aches, shortness of breath and some instances lead to pneumonia [1,2]. In serious conditions, it causes ARDS-Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome i.e. a lung inflammation so severe that fluid builds up around and within the lungs which can cause septic shock due to dramatic fall in blood pressure and bodily organs are starved for oxygen. Incubation period of this corona virus is approximately 1 to 14 days. Symptoms and their severity vary from patient to patient. The elderly people, children below 6 years and patients with past medical history of asthma, diabetes, heart ailment are more vulnerable to this disease due to weaker or compromised immune systems. The epicenter of the outbreak was located in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [2,3]. This outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of international concern on 30th January 2020 by WHO owing to is quick transmission with an estimated reproductive number (Ro) of 2.2. It has spread to nearly 187 countries worldwide with over 2,66,073 confirmed cases and over 11,184 confirmed deaths with a recorded case fatality rate (CFT) of 4.4 as of March 20, 2020 [4].",

Other similar agents previously known are Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV [5,6]. They attack patient's lower respiratory system by invading the pulmonary epithelial cells, delivering their nucleocapsid and hijacking the cellular machinery to replicate in the cytoplasm. The virus family also affect heart, kidney, liver, gastrointestinal system and central nervous system. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to Coronaviridae family of enveloped single-stranded, positive-strand ribonucleic acid (RNA) structure. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 is in close resemblance to that of SARS-CoV. This SARS family contains 14 binding residues out of which 8 amino acids are specifically conserved for SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, the binding residues of this family interact with the ACE-2 (Angiotensin converting enzyme-2) directly [2,7].",

Quarantining the infected patients, aggressive testing and rapid diagnosis of suspected victims, use of appropriate masks, frequent hand washing will help to counter and control the progression of this severe disease [8]. Currently, no drug or vaccine is available for coping this disease. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 is far more contagious compared to other flu-viruses as one pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic person is capable to infect >2 healthy individuals. Researchers are now focusing on the repurpose strategy of existing drugs. Scientists working in this field have suggested the usage of some known broad-spectrum antiviral drugs like Nucleoside analogues and HIV-protease inhibitors as promising treatment methodology. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) are also viable drug targets for COVID-19 treatment. Some antiviral drugs like Favinapir, Ritoavir, Oseltamivir, Lopinavir, Ganciclovir and Remdesivir are clinically tested against COVID-19 infection. Chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, has been proven to be effective in treatment of COVID-19 [2,9].",

These drugs are found to be effective in silico, in vitro and in animal models but failed to impart effectiveness in clinical studies of COVID-19 patients [[28], [29], [30]]. An adenosine analog known as Remdesivir is a prodrug of Remdesivir-triphosphate. Mechanism of this drug is to inhibit RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). It can terminate RNA synthesis by replacing ATP in the polymerization and thus known as chain terminator drug. Importantly, some studies suggested that ATP serves as the main substrate to NSP12 of SARS-CoV RdRp and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp shares 97% sequence similarity to SARS. Thus, Remdesivir can inhibit human corona viruses SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 strains that have ability to replicate in human epithelial cells [[30], [31], [32]].",

Hydroxyl group of Lopinavir interacts by forming H-bond with amino acid Glu166. Furthermore, H-bond interaction is observed between amino acid Hie41 and \u2018\u2014NH\u2019 group of tetrahydro pyrimidine ring scaffold. A pi-pi stacking interaction is also visible between amino acid Hie41 and phenyl ring. Although it can bind to the enzyme tightly, it is not proven effective in clinical studies. Whereas in case of Remdesivir, interactions with COVID-19 are same as that of Lopinavir but one additional strong H-bonding is observed for Remdesivir. Hydroxyl group of Remdesivir can form H-bond interaction with amino acid Glu166. Along with that, other hydroxyl groups have tight binding with amino acid Asn142. \u2018N\u2019 of cyano group also interacts with Asn142 by forming H-bonding. A phenyl group of Remdesivir forms pi-pi stacking interaction with amino acid Hie41. Based on our results, Remdesivir contains 5-cyano-3,4-dihydroxytetrahydrofuran ring scaffold which is responsible for enhanced binding affinity towards the COVID-19 enzymes and may be the reason for its good clinical activity against SARS CoV2.",

HIV protease inhibitors have been suggested as one of the potential treatments of COVID-19. In this work, docking studies were performed on 61 molecules of known antiviral activities. In this study also many HIV protease inhibitors showed remarkable binding interactions with COVID-19 enzymes. These 4 protease inhibitors Lopinavir, Asunaprevir, Indinavir, and Ritonavir are found to be useful. Remdesivir acting on viral RNA polymerase also impart better activity in silico. Along with these, some new molecules emerged as COVID-19 inhibitors like Methisazone, ABT450 (Paritaprevir) and CGP42112A. Methisazone inhibits protein synthesis in POX virus and interacts with 5R7Z, 5R80 and 5R81 enzymes with dock score values of \u22127.542, \u22126.829 and \u22126.928, respectively. According to this study, angiotensin AT2 receptor will become a future drug target for COVID-19. One of the angiotensin AT2 receptors agonist CGP42112A shows potential characteristic of binding to COVID-19. The dock score values of CGP42112A with PDB ID 7R7Y, 5R81 and 5R82 are \u22127.108, \u22127.521 and \u22127.243, respectively.
