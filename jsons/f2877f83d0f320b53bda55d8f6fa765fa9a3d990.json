The parameter \uf06d is the birth rate and death rate by causes other than COVID-19. This value has been practically constant in Brazil for more than 10 years. Then, for this parameter, the assigned standard deviation of the prior was 1% of the mean value. The parameters \uf0663 and \uf0664 represent the probabilities of symptomatic and hospitalized individuals to recover.

Figures 5a and 5b are analogous to figures 4.a,b, but refer to the number of reported deaths. These figures clearly show the great improvement of the agreement of estimated and observed quantities after the MCMC method was run. We note, however, that such an agreement could not be further improved by considering constant values for the parameters, like in the model presented above.

Distribution of the model parameters were also given by the estimations on this same date.Figures 10.a,b present the observed (shown by circles) number of cases and number of deaths, respectively, the estimated means and the 95% credibility intervals (given by blue and red lines, such as in figures 8.a,b), as well as the predictions obtained with the Monte Carlo simulations (yellow lines).

Figures 10.a,b clearly show that the present model, with the parameters obtained with the Particle Filter, accurately fits the number of reported cases and the number of reported deaths, for 10 days ahead of the period used for the solution of the state estimation problem. The observed number of reported cases tend follow the median line of the Monte Carlo simulations, with a trend towards the 2.5% quantile line for the last three days. On the other hand, the observed number of deaths follows very closely the 97.5% quantile line of the predictions obtained with the present model and correspondent estimated parameters. Figures 10.a,b suggest that the particle filter must be used to periodically update the estimation of state variables and model parameters, so that future predictions (in a period of about 10 days) can be made.
