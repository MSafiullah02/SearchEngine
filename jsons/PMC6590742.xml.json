Fifteen species of enterovirus are known, 7 of which are known to infect humans. These species include enterovirus A\u2013D and rhinovirus A\u2013C (1,2). The newly emerging genotype C105 (EV-C105) represents a novel monophyletic clade of enterovirus C; this strain was identified in 2010 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (strain 34S) (3,4). EV-C105 cases from Italy (Pavia/8376, Pavia/9095), Romania (ROM31), the United States (USA/OK/2014-19362), New Zealand (strains not available), and Burundi (BU77, BU5) have been identified and characterized, suggesting that the spread of EV-C105 could be wider than previously hypothesized (5). Here, we report a detected case of EV-C105 in an 11-year-old girl with lower respiratory tract symptoms in Beijing, China.",

Chest radiographs showed thickness or turbulence in the texture in both lungs, which was diagnosed as pneumonia. She received supportive treatment and received antimicrobial drugs empirically before being sent home the same day. She was not hospitalized during her illness. According to a follow-up survey, she recovered 14 days later. We detected no other respiratory pathogens in this patient.",
