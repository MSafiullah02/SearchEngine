            "text": "The pathogenic role of CMV infection is well established. Although retinitis is the most common manifestation of infection, before the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy, GI infection of the oesophagus, stomach, small bowel and colon occur in 5\u201315% of patients during the course of HIV infection. The incidence of CMV retinitis has declined following the introduction of HAART, with a concomitant increase in survival5. This is also presumably true of GI CMV, although published data are limited. Although CMV can infect any part of the GI tract, the most common site of infection is the colon6, and the most common manifestation of CMV colitis is chronic or intermittent diarrhoea in association with abdominal pain. The disease is also associated with mild or severe rectal bleeding or abdominal pain in the absence of diarrhoea and, in addition, fever is common at presentation. Pain can precede the development of toxic megacolon, and intestinal perforation is rare but clearly life threatening. Colonic CMV infection can occur in association with infection elsewhere in the GI tract including the oesophagus, which usually results in dysphagia and odynophagia, and the pancreatico-biliary tree, which results from AIDS-related cholangiopathy or pancreatitis and manifests as pain in the upper abdomen. GI infection can also herald CMV retinitis and careful retinal assessment is, therefore, essential in this group.",

            "text": "The mechanisms by which CMV induces GI disease are poorly understood. CMV infection of the mucosa is associated with a marked local inflammatory response, which might have a role in inducing mucosal ulceration. Wilcox and colleagues found that mRNA levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor a (TNF-a) were elevated in oesophageal mucosa of patients with CMV oesophagitis, but returned to normal following treatment of CMV (Ref. 7). Similarly, Sharpstone et al. noted increased levels of TNF-a in faecal samples from patients with GI CMV (Ref. 8). The enteric ischaemia that results from CMV-associated vasculitis might conceivably play a role in GI CMV (Ref. 9). Although this hypothesis remains unexplored in CMV enteritis, a similar mechanism has been invoked to explain the aetio-pathogenesis of the inflammatory enteritis, Crohn's disease. The role of CMV-specific T cells in GI disease is unclear. Patients with serological evidence of CMV but without clinical disease have CD81 T cells that are specific for pp65, the CMV lower matrix protein, in gut-associated lymphoid tissue10. By contrast, systemic CMV-specific CD41 cells wane in patients treated with long-term HAART (Ref. 11). Further studies are required to determine the role of CMV specific T-cell responses in patients with HIV.",

In a prospective study, Wilcox and colleagues evaluated 55 patients with HIV by sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. Chronic diarrhoea and abdominal pain occurred in 80% and 50% of patients respectively and 9% presented with lower GI bleeding with a previous history of diarrhoea12. Endoscopically, appearances were heterogeneous. Three main categories were identified: (1) colitis associated with ulceration (39%); (2) ulceration alone (38%); or (3) colitis alone (20%). Subepithelial haemorrhage was common in all groups. A total of 31 patients underwent complete endoscopy to the caecum. Of these, four (9%) had disease that was proximal to the splenic flexure without distal involvement that was therefore inaccessible by flexible sigmoid-oscopy. This contrasts with early reports suggesting higher rates of right-sided colitis13. The same group has assessed the varied endoscopic appearances of CMV infection of the oesphagus14. Multiple ulcers, located in the middle or lower oesophagus, were identified in 58% of patients. These were usually less than 1 cm in diameter and superficial. The heterogeneous manifestation of CMV disease in both the colon and oesophagus makes biopsy essential for accurate diagnosis.",

In addition, specific immunoperoxidase staining for CMV is also useful in identifying GI disease15; positive staining is more likely from the edge of ulcers and some authors claim greater sensitivity compared to conventional histology, although it is unclear from these reports how rigorously inclusions bodies have been excluded16., 17.. The value of a viral culture of intestinal biopsies is limited as this is a time-consuming procedure. Furthermore, CMV viraemia can occur in the absence of mucosal disease, which can lead to a false-positive diagnosis if biopsies are contaminated with blood. Although using in situ hybridization to assess GI CMV disease is both sensitive and specific, it probably offers little additional benefit over conventional histology18. Using the PCR for the detection of CMV might also be more sensitive than using standard histological techniques; however, evidence suggests that this technique lacks specificity, with 28% of normal GI biopsies positive by PCR. Furthermore, as with in situ hybridization, there is the risk of PCR giving a false-positive result in patients with viraemia. The sensitivity of conventional histology, viral culture, PCR and immunohistochemistry are summarized in Table 2\n(Ref. 19). Cotte and colleagues monitored CMV DNA levels during treatment and levels broadly reflected clinical response20.",

In a multivariate analysis, plasma CMV DNA, raised pp65 antigenaemia or a CD4 count of 75 cells ml21 were identified as independent risk factors in the development of CMV disease21. Others have compared these techniques with retinal assessment in the evaluation of CMV retinitis. The Digene hybrid capture CMV DNA system was 85% as sensitive as retinal assessment, which is similar to the more cumbersome pp65 antigenaemia assay (80% as sensitive)22.

HAART can result in remission of previously persistent opportunistic infections, including CMV infection5. However, the development of viral resistance and difficulties with compliance could lead to breakthrough HIV viraemia and the re-emergence or reacquisition of opportunistic GI infections. Unfortunately, combination antiretroviral therapy is costly and, consequently, unavailable to the vast majority of HIV patients world-wide. Patients on HAART with stable CMV retinitis and CD4 counts of 150 cells ml21 were able to successfully discontinue antiCMV maintenance therapy without relapse of retinitis or development of extraocular disease over a mean follow-up period of 16 months30. Importantly, immune reactivation retinitis occurred in 90% of patients started on HAART before discontinuation of antiCMV treatment, with substantial visual loss in the minority of patients. MacDonald and colleagues report similar findings, although the follow-up period was considerably shorter, and they do not comment on immune reactivation retinitis31. Others find that HAART causes a significant and progressive decline in CMV viraemia in the absence of specific antiCMV treatment32. It is intriguing to speculate about the possible occurrence of immune reactivation enteritis in patients with GI CMV; this has not been described to date.",

In HIV patients, Dionisio and colleagues report increasing stool carriage of subgenus F type 40 adeno-virus with increasing immunosuppression34. Janoff and colleagues first described adenovirus colitis35. Electron microscopy or culture of colonic biopsies from 67 HIV patients investigated for diarrhoea identified adenovirus in five patients. Colonoscopy revealed mild inflammatory change in two of these patients. Focal necrosis and amphophilic nuclear inclusions within degenerating epithelial cells were shown using light microscopy, and electron microscopy revealed characteristic hexagonal adenovirus particles within the inclusions (Fig. 1\n). Maddox et al. have confirmed these characteristic features and found that specific immunostaining for adenovirus is both sensitive and specific for the identification of adenovirus inclusions36. The pathogenic role of adenovirus remains unclear as this group of patients is frequently co-infected with other known pathogens. Thomas and co-workers report that adenovirus colitis is significantly more likely to be associated with chronic diarrhoea37, while Schmidt and colleagues were able to detect adenovirus only in AIDS patients who are severely immunosuppressed38. Although in the severely immunosuppressed group, adenovirus was detected more frequently in patients with diarrhoea than without (10% vs 3.3%), both positive and negative correlations between adenovirus and diarrhoea have been reported by other groups (Table 1)37., 38., 39., 40., 41., 42., 43.. Most studies indicate a strong association between infection with adenovirus and co-infection with other pathogens, in particular CMV. It is difficult, therefore, to ascribe a pathogenic role to this virus with any certainty37., 38., 39..",

Electron microscopy, polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and enzyme immunoassay were used to examine samples for rotavirus, adenovirus, calcivirus and picobirnavirus. Paired sera were also analysed for antibodies to Norwalk and picobirnavirus. Overall, virus was detected in 35% of patients with diarrhoea and 12% without diarrhoea. Astrovirus, picobirnavirus, calcivirus (including SRSV) and adenovirus were identified significantly more often in patients with diarrhoea. Unfortunately, co-infection with other known pathogens was not evaluated systematically and no information regarding the relative distribution of acute and chronic diarrhoea was provided. Schmidt and colleagues detected virus in 17% of stool samples from 256 HIV-infected patients38. Adenovirus and coronavirus were detected more frequently in patients with diarrhoea than without (10% vs 3.3% and 15% vs 6.6% respectively) and both were associated with severe immunosuppression. Thea et al. found no association between enteric virus shedding and diarrhoea in a study performed in Zaire40. Overall, this group identified enteric virus, including rotavirus, SRSV, coronavirus and adenovirus in 17% of samples analysed. They noted a trend towards increased shedding with greater immunosuppression, a finding in common with Cunningham and colleagues43. An association of rotavirus with prolonged diarrhoea in HIV patients, as detected by enzyme immunoassay was also reported, although other groups do not support this finding41. Data from selected studies that have evaluated enteric virus carriage in HIV patients are summarized in Table 3\n.",

The best evidence relates to adenovirus infection although its pathogenic role is far from certain. We speculate that many of these viruses cause only self-limiting acute diarrhoea or, as in the case of adenovirus, act as a cofactor in CMV infection. Little is known about therapeutic options for these putative pathogens, although ribavarin might be effective in the treatment of adenovirus (R.C.G. Pollok, unpublished). The impact of HAART on non-CMV enteric virus infection has not yet been evaluated and warrants study.",

Assays for CMV DNA and the CMV pp65 antigen assay offer the prospect of CMV surveillance before the development of end-organ disease, which will allow the tailored introduction of prophylaxis. Oral ganciclovir and valganciclovir (which, of the two, has greater bioavailability) are potentially useful prophylactic agents. Second generation CMV treatments are becoming available and are being evaluated, largely in transplant patients. The advent of HAART has dramatically reduced the occurrence of all opportunistic infections, including CMV. Consequently, this has made evaluation of these newer agents difficult in patients with HIV. HAART is unlikely to be widely available in the developing world in the immediate future and diarrhoeal disease continues to contribute to the death toll of HIV patients in these countries. The role of non-CMV enteric infection in HIV-related diarrhoea remains uncertain and unless further research is undertaken the importance of these viruses in HIV-related diarrhoea is unlikely to be established.",
