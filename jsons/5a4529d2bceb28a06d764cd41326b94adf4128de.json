The aim of this study was to provide a summary of the most common pathogens of URI and to compare advantages and disadvantages of traditional and new rapid microbiological tests used to identify them. Blood samples were simultaneously examined by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by the FilmArray Respiratory Panel for eight different pathogens in a total of 15 tests performed in nasopharyngeal swabs. The ELISA method is unable to identify the pathologic agent until the host's immune system elicits a response. The method is readily available in many laboratories at a low cost, which puts less strain on economic resources. The FilmArray \u00ae Panel, on the other hand, is more expensive, but it is fast and exact in the identification of a broad spectrum etiologic agents. Nonetheless, since most repiratory tract infections are viral in origin and there is no treatment available, the diagnosis provided by the FilmArray Panel does not provide any additional clinical benefit and thus should be used only whenever necessary on the individual basis.",

Acute URIs include the common cold, pharyngitis, epiglottitis, and laryngotracheitis (Nester et al. 1995) . A variety of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites can infect the respiratory tract. Transmission of organisms occurs by aerosol droplet or direct hand-to-hand contact with infected secretions, with subsequent passage to the nares or eyes. Most URIs are of viral etiology (Dasaraju and Liu 1996) . Epiglottitis and laryngotracheitis are exceptions with severe cases likely caused by Haemophilus influenzae type B. Bacterial pharyngitis is often caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. Bacterial and viral upper respiratory infections produce highly variable clinical symptoms that cannot be used to identify the etiologic agent. Proper treatment depends on the correct identification of a pathogen involved as antibiotics provide little or no benefit with viral infections (Nester et al. 1995) .",

Orthomyxoviruses (influenza A and B), paramyxoviruses (parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial viruses), coronaviruses, adenoviruses, and enteroviruses (coxsackie and ECHO viruses) cause common cold. However, most colds are caused by more than 89 types of rhinoviruses (Musher 2003; Cooper et al. 2001 ). More than 40 strains of adenoviruses cause pharyngitis resembling a strep throat. Rhinoviruses are unresponsive to antibiotics and other medications that control bacterial infections. Antibiotic treatment of adenovirus infections is of no value and sometimes can even be harmful, because it supresses normal bacterial flora and enables the resistant opportunistic pathogens to grow in an uncontrolled way (Nester et al. 1995 (Murray et al. 2005) . The most common URI of bacterial origin is pharyngitis caused by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, with Streptococcous pyogenes as a main representative, which accounts for 5-10% of pharyngitides (Poole and Portugal 2005 ",

This result, however, is inconclusive regarding an acute current infection as it rather confirms a previous encounter with the virus. The result regarding influenza A infection was also negative (IgM -0.355, cut off -0.832, index -0.4; and IgG -0.083, cut off -0.381, index -0.2). The testing time for all eight pathogens amounted to 22 days (Table 2 ; Patient 2). The examination with the FilmArray Panel in this patient identified the etiologic agent as influenza A/H1-2009 (Table 3 ; Patient 2). The identification had to be confirmed with a serum hemagglutination inhibition test (HIT), which was done at the Department of Virology of the Regional Institute of Public Health, in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica, Slovakia. The HIT was performed twice 2 weeks apart to assess a possible change in antibody titers. While in the first sample influenza A and B titers were negative, there was a significant rise in the antibody titer against Table 4 . Health insurance gave 600 points for each of the 15 tests, which makes a total 9000 points, plus 150 points for sample culture from upper respiratory tract and 320 points for a culture form lower respiratory tract. Each insurance point has a value of 0.0066 \u20ac. The laboratory therefore received 59.40 \u20ac for running the ELISA and additionally 3.10 \u20ac for the cultures, which sums up to a total of 62.50 \u20ac or 224% of the real material costs. On the other hand, health insurance gave 2500 points for each of the 21 pathogen targets in the FilmArray Panel, which makes a total of 52,500 points and comes to 346.50 \u20ac or 210% of the real material costs amounting to 165.00 \u20ac per sample. The insurance reimbursed 11.70 \u20ac for influenza A and B testing each. Each type of influenza was tested twice giving the cost of 46.80 \u20ac in total. The actual laboratory costs for all HIT tests were 8.00 \u20ac, which is about 6 times less than the insurance reimbursement.",

The symptomatology in the second patient was severe and the speed of pathogen identification is crucial for the commencement of appropriate treatment, especially in suspected cases of influenza where early administration of neuraminidase inhibitors significantly reduces mortality rates. In such cases, accuratelly targeted therapy has an enormous benefit for the patient.
