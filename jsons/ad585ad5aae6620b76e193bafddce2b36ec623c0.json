Interestingly, PVM was isolated from lung tissue from the control (thought to be uninfected) mice, which yielded an infectious isolate after undergoing serial mouse-to-mouse passage. Choppin and colleagues [10] presented the first electron micrographs of these newly discovered virions ( Fig. 35 .1), which they described as defining a new, third subgroup of myxoviruses. The polymorphic virions formed spheres of 80-120 millimicrons in diameter to filaments up to three microns in length, and replicated over a period of 24-30 hours in mouse lung tissue in vivo, with virus amplification proceeding at ~16-fold per cycle. Perhaps most interestingly, Ginsberg and Horsfall [11] recognized the potential of PVM for the exploration of acute respiratory virus infection in an evolutionarily relevant host. Among several studies, these authors were the first to relate the development of lung lesions to ongoing virus replication and to evaluate altered morbidity and mortality in response to rudimentary immumodulatory therapy, specifically in response to administration of bacterial capsular polysaccharide [11] [12] [13] .",

The original studies by Horsfall and colleagues [9, [11] [12] [13] were performed on an isolate known as strain 15, which was at that time highly pathogenic in mice. Since that time, PVM strain 15 has reportedly undergone tissue-culture passage and lost some of its pathogenicity in vivo, although the extent to which this is so, and in which specific isolates, remains uncertain. A second strain, PVM strain J3666, also developed at the Rockefeller University, has been reportedly maintained in mice with minimal tissueculture passage, and has recently been shown to be highly pathogenic in nearly all inbred strains of mice [19] . In our hands, PVM strain 15 from Dr. Andrew Easton's laboratory (PVM strain 15 Warwick) is highly attenuated and elicits Shown are the 3\u00a2 to 5\u00a2 linear order of PVM and RSV protein encoding genes, including non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2), nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), surface hydrophobic protein (SH), attachment protein (G), fusion protein (F), the M2 genes, and polymerase protein (L). Reprinted with permission from Rosenberg, et al. [5] a minimal inflammatory response in the highly susceptible BALB/c strain of mice [20] . In contrast, PVM strain 15 from the American Type Culture collection (PVM strain 15 ATCC) is pathogenic in BALB/c mice (unpublished findings), but results in little to no disease in the less susceptible C57BL/6 strain at similar inoculating doses [<100 pfu/mouse [21] ]. Krempl and colleagues [22] likewise found PVM strain 15 (ATCC) to be highly pathogenic in the BALB/c strain. Complete sequence data are available for both PVM strain J3666 and PVM strain 15 [23, 24] . The most remarkable differences are in selected regions of the G (attachment protein) and throughout the sequence of the SH small hydrophobic glycoprotein.",

We have localized immunoreactive PVM to the bronchiolar epithelium [27] , in a distribution similar to what has been observed for RSV in human postmortem specimens [28] (Fig. 35.3 ). Microscopic examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue from morbid mice revealed profound inflammation, most notable for recruitment of granulocytes and for severe pulmonary edema consistent with the clinical findings characteristic of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS; Fig. 35.4) . Interestingly, severe inflammation, edema and recruitment of granulocytes have also been characterized in a recent series of RSVdiagnosed post-mortem samples evaluated by Welliver and colleagues [28] . PVM replication in situ results in local production of proinflammatory mediators, including MIP-1a, MIP-2, MCP-1 and IFN-g [27] . A similar subset of proinflammatory mediators is produced in association with the more severe forms of RSV in human infants (reviewed in ref. 29 ].",

Specifically, MIP-1a gene-deleted mice are readily infected with PVM, although 10 5 -fold fewer granulocytes are recruited to the lung tissue in response to the identical initial inoculum. Similar results were obtained upon infecting mice devoid of CCR1, the major receptor for MIP-1a on neutrophils and eosinophils. We have used this observation to design specific immunomodulatory strategies for the virus-induced inflammatory response and its associated pathology [31, 32] (discussed further below). Interestingly, although MIP-1a is clearly crucial for granulocyte recruitment in response to PVM infection, this chemokine, acting alone, even at high concentrations, does not induce ARDS, nor does it recruit granulocytes effectively in the absence of IFN-g [33] .",

The differences observed when comparing these results to those reported among elderly human subjects, who tend to have more severe, rather than less severe forms of RSV infection, may be related to virus re-exposure and its impact on the ensuing biochemical and cellular inflammatory responses. Interestingly, there is no published data on PVM replication and disease pathogenesis in neonatal mice, a critical target population given the prevalence of pneumovirus infection among human infants and toddlers.",

Of particular recent interest are the ways in which IFNs and IFN-mediated signaling mechanisms interact with proinflammatory pathways and modulate the production of chemoattractant cytokines. As part of a larger exploration of the inflammatory responses to PVM, we examined the differential expression of cytokine genes in wild-type mice and mice devoid of the receptor for type I interferons (IFNabR gene-deleted mice) [36] . As anticipated, PVM infection induces transcription of IFN antiviral response genes preferentially in lung tissue of wildtype over IFNabR gene-deleted mice. However, we demonstrate that PVM infection also results in enhanced expression of eotaxin-2, TARC, and the proinflammatory RNase mouse eosinophil-associated RNase (mEar) 11, and we observe paradoxically prolonged survival among the IFNabR genedeleted mice.",

Among the interesting questions, we are not certain of the duration of protective immunity. Interestingly, the responses of IFNgR gene-deleted mice were indistinguishable from the wild-type mice, indicating that any role for IFN-g in generating acquired immunity in this setting is at least somewhat dispensable ( Fig. 35.5 ).

Yet, analogous to observations made in clinical studies, administration of effective doses of ribavirin alone to PVM-infected, symptomatic mice, has little impact on the ultimate outcome of disease, when measured in terms of morbidity and mortality [31, 32] . In conjunction with this observation, we found that, although ribavirin was quite effective at blocking virus replication, it had no impact on the ongoing production of proinflammatory chemokines and associated recruitment of granulocytes to the lung tissue. Clearly, there is some disconnect between virus replication and the ensuing inflammatory response, in that inflammation is not necessarily controlled effectively at all given points in time by reducing or eliminating the primary stimulus.",

            "text": "Given our earlier observation on the crucial nature of the chemokine, MIP-1a, in promoting granulocyte recruitment in response to virus infection, we considered the possibility that blockade of this chemokine itself, or its signaling via its major receptor, CCR1, might provide appropriate immunomodulatory control in this setting. In a series of studies, we found significant improvements in long-term survival when ribavirin was administered to symptomatic mice in conjunction with anti-MIP-1a antibodies, or with small molecule blockade (met-RANTES) of the MIP-1a receptor, CCR1 [31, 32] (Fig. 35.6 ). of ribavirin with the higher met-RANTES dose, 100 \u00b5g/day, over that observed in response to ribavirin-met-RANTES at 10 \u00b5g/day (** p <0.05), approaching that observed for CCR1 gene-deleted (CCR1 -/-) mice treated with ribavirin, representing theoretical complete receptor blockade. Reprinted with permission from Bonville, et al. [32] A similar study documented the effectiveness of ribavirin in conjunction with the cysteinyl-leukotriene inhibitor montelukast [43] . Interestingly, although neither agent was effective at reducing morbidity or mortality as single-agent therapy, together, administered to infected, symptomatic mice, significant improvements in long-term survival were observed (50% vs. 10% for PBS control). Interestingly, montelukast had little impact overall on neutrophil recruitment, suggesting that the presence of neutrophils alone does not indicate inevitable progression to intractable disease.",

Studies carried out to date have provided an explanation for the lack of clinical efficacy of antiviral therapy, and have indicated that chemokine and/or chemokine-receptor blockade in conjunction with appropriate antiviral therapy might be more effective than antiviral therapy alone. Likewise, PVM is an excellent system in which to explore the molecular mechanisms through which natural immunity to pneumovirus infection develops, information which may assist in the development of novel vaccines and other prevention strategies.",
