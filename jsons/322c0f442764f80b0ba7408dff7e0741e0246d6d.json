Since the very beginning of the COVID 19 pandemic, the health care industry has been forced to confront an invisible enemy -the shortage of personal protected equipment (PPE). The enormous pressure and struggles to secure sufficient and appropriate PPE for the front -line workers in order to provide safe and compassionate care to the COVID patients inevitably add to the tremendous difficulty we face in combating this aggressive and vicious disease, not only at home in the United States, but also resonating around the world.",

As the Medical Director for two Primary Stroke Centers at Downtown Los Angeles, I get to experience first-hand the psychological and physical impacts of the perceived shortage of PPE have on our front-line workers. My call of duties to help tackle this challenge strengthens every day when I witness my colleagues selflessly caring for their COVID patients with inadequate PPE.",

This competition is further complicated by the fact that the Chinese manufacturing plants have been halted for months to combat the disease.",

In late January, we started taking part in several donation chat groups on Facebook and WeChat to solicit PPE to donate to our colleagues in China and other Asian countries, and those efforts turned out to be fruitful. Our participants include physicians, dentists, nurses, other health professionals, as well as entrepreneurs from private and public sectors all around the world. When COVID hits home not long after, we decided to swiftly reverse the direction of donation and the idea of \"reverse engine, full throttle\" was born and announced to our donation group.",

The first significant lead came from an Asian entrepreneur donor who is a friend of a researcher working in a well-known research institution on the east coast. The researcher is a member in our donation chatgroup. Donor pledged over 1,000,000 surgical face masks and equal amount of N-95 face masks to every hospital in the United States on a first-come, first serve basis. Quite frankly, it sounded too good to be true initially. Nonetheless, I decided to jump on the bandwagon and give it a shot. I promptly connected with the charitable foundation and administrations from our hospitals and they all expressed interests. After careful vetting and involvement of legal department from the hospitals, signed consents were sent to the donor. It took numerous rounds of communications and meticulous coordination between the donor, the organizer and the administrators from our hospitals before we got the news that the cargo plane was finally heading to the West Coast. After two weeks of anxiously waiting and more communications back and forth, the shipment finally arrived.",

I truly feel the moment we received the news that all the PPE are qualified to be used was one of the most memorable and accomplishing time in my professional career, to say the very least. I was absolutely thrilled that our efforts have come to fruition in the most critical time.",

One Boeing engineer from the chat group connected with us after she designed a prototype of the water-proof disposable gown that is like what we use in the hospital. After approval from the Infection Control department, we were able to start producing a small quantity of disposable gowns to ease the shortage.
