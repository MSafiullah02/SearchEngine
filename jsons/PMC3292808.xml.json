Indications for venoarterial ECMO include postcardiac surgery (heart surgery or heart transplantation), cardiogenic shock due to acute myocardial infarction or acute myocarditis and intoxication. For cardiac support, the goal is to optimize organ perfusion (by obtaining a SVO2 greater than 70%, which usually needs an output index of about 3 L/min/m2). This is achieved by choosing the appropriate sizes of cannula according to the patient's body surface area.",

Contraindication for anticoagulation remains the most important limitation of this technique.

The pumpless extracorporeal lung assist (PECLA), or Novalung\u00ae [Novalung GmbH, Heilbronn, Germany], is a compact pumpless device driven by the pressure gradient between arterial and venous blood. A femoro-femoral setting is most commonly used. The main advantage of a pumpless device is a reduction in mechanical blood trauma, bleeding and hemolysis. The Novalung\u00ae has been widely studied in ARDS. Three studies have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of this PECLA device [16-18].

Its incidence in CAP ranges from 3% to 22%, varying according to the diagnostic method used [22].

Results of NAATs may be unreliable because of cross-contamination, inappropriate treatment of the clinical samples (leading to the loss of the target nucleic acid) or the presence of inhibiting substances [24]. Additionally, validation of these tests is primarily analytical and not against clinically obtained specimens.",

The MIF test is reliable for detection of a prior exposure to Chlamydiae by the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and is relatively sensitive for the detection of IgM. IgM is an unreliable marker of acute infection in adolescents and adults since it is often not present, presumably because of previous infection by a chlamydial species [24]. Additionally, MIF is quite a laborious and subjective technique that requires much experience, is not standardized and has significant laboratory-to-laboratory variations.",

The first level test is a search by ELISA-technique for anti-major outer membrane protein (MOMP) IgG and IgA antibodies (C. pneumoniae-IgG & IgA-ELISA plus, Medac, Hamburg, Germany) which are species-specific. This permits us to screen patients. The disadvantage of anti-MOMP antibodies is their late appearance in acute primary infection (three weeks for IgA, six to eight weeks for IgG) and their considerable persistence in human serum afterwards, independent of the bacterial eradication. In general, the prevalence of C. pneumoniae IgG antibody reaches 50% in adults above 20 years of age, and 80% in the elderly population (> 70 years old). The second level test is another ELISA assay, rELISA (Medac), for the detection of genus-specific anti-lipopolysaccharide(LPS) antibodies. Chlamydiae contain, as a common immunodominant antigen, the LPS to which the first immune reaction is directed. These anti-LPSs have the main advantage of rising quickly during acute infection (five to ten days for IgA), allowing early diagnosis, and returning to normal a few weeks after the infection and are thus associated to the eradication of the bacterium [26]. The use of paired sera enables the discrimination of current infections, reinfections and reactivations (defined by titer increase) from chronic persistent ones (constant LPS, IgG and IgA antibody titers, present in 5% to 10% of the adult population) for which no antibacterial treatment is needed. The latter is due to the chronic presence of bacteria in the organism in a latent phase (monocytes). Criteria for acute infections are a four-fold increase in IgA or IgG or a doubling of IgA and IgG at 10 to 15 days.",
