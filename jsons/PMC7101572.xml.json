Since the 1918 influenza pandemic, \u201cswine fluA\u201d and, more recently, pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, led to a significant proportion of patients with ARDS [2, 3]. Pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 is associated with a severe outcome, especially in patients with risk factors such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, pregnancy and underlying comorbidities. Although effective treatments for influenza and its complications exist, identifying early predictive factors of poor outcome in ARDS patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection remains relevant [4]. Some studies have shown that A(H1N1)pdm09 can cause a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d with an excessive inflammatory immune response, and this could be a key factor involved in the severe outcome with this virus flu [5\u20137].",

MBL is a key component of innate immunity [8\u201310], as it activates complement, promotes opsonophagocytosis, and induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In inflammatory conditions, MBL can leave the blood stream via vascular leakage. In an experimental study, Ling et al. showed that MBL wild-type mice had more severe lung disease with enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines than MBL knock-out mice during A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection, suggesting that MBL may contribute to disease severity. In their study, MBL contributed to a deleterious inflammatory response by upregulating the pro-inflammatory cytokines [11].",

Some studies have shown that influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection can induce dysregulation of the immune system, such as cytokine storm and excessive inflammatory infiltrates, leading to lung injury [11]. Among these factors, excessive cytokine production is considered to be the key contributor in severe response during influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection [5]. MBL contributes to a deleterious inflammatory response by upregulating the pro-inflammatory response [11]. In our study, we determine the serum levels of MBL in critically ill patients with severe A(H1N1)pdm09 infection and analyzed the correlation between plasmatic MBL levels and the risk of mortality. In our study, a serum MBL level > 1870 ng/ml was independently associated with mortality in ICU patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection and therefore could predict an increased mortality at 30 days.",

            "text": "MBL belongs to the collectin family and functions as a pattern-recognition molecule recognizing a wide range of pathogens. It plays an important role in innate immunity [10]. MBL may represent an important barrier to the establishment of influenza virus infection in epithelial cells. The antiviral activity of MBL against influenza viruses remains controversial. Previous in vitro studies have suggested that MBL exhibits anti-influenza virus function by direct neutralization after binding to mannose-rich glycans on haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins [15\u201317]. However, this needs to be balanced as the antiviral function of MBL may vary among different strains of influenza viruses, depending on the number of potential glycosylation sites on the viral haemagglutinin globular domain. MBL has been shown to inhibit influenza A seasonal H3N2 and seasonal H1N1 viruses through direct neutralization, indirect opsonization, and complement activation, but limited antiviral effect against H7N9 virus [18]. In contrast, MBL can bind to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus but fails to inhibit its infection in human lung epithelial cell line. Ling et al. have demonstrated in an experimental study that upon A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, MBL is internalized with the virus into the cell, where it may associate with TLR3 to further amplify the NF-\u03baB signaling and augment the cytokine production in the human lung epithelial cells (supplementary data). Their findings advocate the adverse immunomodulating role of MBL during A(H1N1)pdm09 infection by upregulating pro-inflammatory response [11] or may contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory-induced vascular damage and organ failure, as observed in patients undergoing solid organ transplantation, leading to a harmful effect of an excessive MBL expression [19].",

This heterogeneous distribution in the control group can be explained by individual variations in serum MBL levels that may reflect gene polymorphism ranging from (i) homozygotes with a mean MBL concentrations of 2660 ng/ml (range 40\u20136790 ng/ml), (ii) heterozygotes with mean MBL concentrations of 830 ng/ml (range 0\u20134460 ng/ml, and (iii) compound heterozygotes and mutant homozygotes with mean MBL concentrations of 40 ng/ml (range 0\u2013300 ng/ml). Genotype is one of the determinant factors of serum MBL concentrations. However, MBL levels vary significantly among individuals with the same genotype, and the serum MBL concentration may more accurately reflects downstream effector function than genotype. MBL levels do not vary with respect to age, sex, physical exercise, season, time of day, or liver function [16] [20] and are stable during storage at \u221280 \u00b0C through a number of freeze\u2013thaw cycles. Despite these differences in MBL concentrations due to genetic variations, the decrease in serum MBL levels due to MBL consumption during pathogen binding is compensated by an increase in MBL gene transcription during acute infection [12, 13].",

Many studies have shown that low serum MBL levels are associated with a susceptibility to bacterial, fungal and viral, and leads to a worse outcome [14, 24]. On the other side, sporadic reports have not found a clear association between MBL deficiency and increased rate of infectious episodes [25\u201327]. Despite these informations, little is known about the MBL immunomodulatory role in established influenza infection. Chang et al. demonstrate in a mouse study that MBL plays a key role in clearing influenza A virus and lung homeostasis. In the other side, this study suggests that MBL deficiency maybe a risk factor in influenza A virus infection. Our study included adult patients with severe ARDS with very high mortality score (SAPSII and SOFA scores) that can explain high serum MBL levels as a response to an acute phase response as demonstrated by Patersen et al. [28].",
