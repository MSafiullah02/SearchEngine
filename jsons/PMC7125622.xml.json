            "text": "The diagnosis of chronic gastrointestinal causes is one of exclusion, and a full diagnostic workup needs to be done first to rule out all known causes of extragastrointestinal inflammation. This workup commonly involves a complete blood cell count, serum biochemical analysis, urinalysis, and fecal analysis for helminth and protozoal parasites (Giardia and Tritrichomonas in cats). Further tests are indicated if none of these tests are abnormal: trypsin-like immunoreactivity to exclude EPI, canine pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (cPLI) to assess the possibility of pancreatitis or pancreatic tumors, corticotropin stimulation test or basal cortisol concentration to exclude hypoadrenocorticism, and cobalamin concentrations to assess the absorptive function of the distal small intestine. Total thyroxine (T4) and FeLV/FIV infection also should be assessed in cats. Abdominal ultrasonography will be more helpful than endoscopy in determining whether the small and/or large intestine is affected and whether there are mass lesions that need surgical intervention. If the results of these tests do not determine the cause for the clinical signs and the patient is stable (ie, has a normal appetite, is not lethargic, there is no or minimal weight loss, the serum protein concentration is normal, and there is no intestinal thickening on diagnostic imaging), a well-conducted therapeutic trial with an elimination diet or hydrolyzed diet for at least 2 weeks can be performed. If there is no response to a well-conducted dietary trial within 2 weeks after starting the diet, it is unlikely that the patient is suffering from food-responsive disease (FRD) (food allergy or food intolerance).7 If the dietary trial is unsuccessful, antimicrobials (metronidazole, 10\u201315 mg/kg by mouth twice a day or tylosin, 10 mg/kg by mouth once to twice a day) for 2 to 3 weeks can be administered. Intestinal biopsies for histopathology are collected from those patients that either fail to respond to empiric therapy or have worsening of their clinical signs. Most patients with chronic enteropathies can be diagnosed by obtaining endoscopic biopsies, as long as at least 12 to 15 biopsies from the small intestine are taken (Fig. 1\n). In rare cases, a diagnosis of lymphoma can be missed if no full-thickness biopsies are obtained, especially in cats, and if the ileum has not been sampled.",

Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE) accounts for the loss of albumin through the gut mucosa in severely affected dogs with IBD. PLE in dogs can be associated with severe lymphoplasmacytic IBD, intestinal lymphoma, or, rarely, primary lymphangiectasia. In one study of dogs with IBD, 12 of 80 (16%) dogs had hypoalbuminemia and 4 of 80 (5%) had panhypoproteinemia.8 Seven of 12 dogs with hypoalbuminemia had to be euthanized for intractable IBD, identifying decreased serum albumin concentration as a major risk factor associated with a worse outcome. In another recent prospective study of dogs with IBD, 12 of 58 (21%) dogs initially presented with hypoalbuminemia.7 Of these 12 dogs, 7 were panhypoproteinemic with severe hypoalbuminemia (mean albumin level 11 g/L), and 3 of these dogs eventually had to be euthanized. However, it must be noted that relatively mild reductions in serum albumin (<2 g/L) previously had been associated with an increased risk of refractoriness to treatment. At this level, most patients will not yet show any clinical signs of hypoalbuminemia, such as ascites, peripheral edema, or pleural effusion.",

Serum albumin concentration also can be used to monitor patients, as improvement of serum albumin concentrations higher than 2 g/L usually indicates treatment success, even if clinical improvement can be seen earlier in some cases. It is therefore recommended to evaluate serum albumin concentrations every 2 to 3 weeks to assess when treatment can be tapered off or discontinued.",

In a retrospective study of 50 dogs with IBD, the author\u2019s group18 evaluated clinical signs, age, serum lipase and amylase activities, albumin and cobalamin concentrations, abdominal ultrasonography results, histopathologic review of intestinal biopsies, management of IBD, and follow-up in dogs with IBD, either with or without concurrent chronic pancreatitis. Sixteen dogs with increased cPLI and 32 dogs with normal cPLI values were compared. No significant differences were found for clinical activity score, serum amylase activity, serum lipase activity, serum cobalamin concentration, serum albumin concentration, abdominal ultrasonography scores, and histopathology scores for IBD. There was no difference in the frequency of steroid treatment between the groups. Dogs with IBD and concurrent elevated cPLI were significantly older than dogs without elevated cPLI. Moreover, dogs with elevated cPLI had a higher risk of a poor follow-up score and were significantly more likely to be euthanized at follow-up. These data show that elevated cPLI in canine IBD may indicate that a subset of these patients could also have chronic subclinical pancreatitis. In patients that have been diagnosed with IBD and also have elevated cPLI without overt imaging evidence of acute pancreatitis, it is recommended to discuss treatment options for IBD that also will treat possible autoimmune pancreatitis. The author has had anecdotal success with cyclosporine at 5 mg/kg daily for 8 weeks in such cases.",

The \u03b11-PI assay is especially valuable in patients with intestinal disease that have concurrent renal or hepatic disease. In these patients, measurement of fecal \u03b11-PI can help assess which portion, if any, of the protein loss can be attributed to the intestine. This test is available only at the Texas GI Laboratory. Ideally, 3 consecutive fresh fecal samples should be submitted to improve test accuracy, which means that fecal \u03b11-PI is not a useful test for practitioners outside North America.",

            "text": "Sampling of intestinal biopsies is an essential step in the evaluation of small intestinal disorders, to exclude neoplastic causes and confirm the presence of intestinal inflammation. However, interpretation of intestinal biopsies is difficult and subject to controversy. In several recent studies looking at conventional histologic interpretation of intestinal biopsies, there was no correlation between clinical activity and histologic grading either before or after therapy.7, 20, 22 In addition, total lymphocyte counts as well as the number of infiltrating CD3 cells in the lamina propria cannot be used as markers for clinical activity of disease, as there is no difference in cell counts before and after treatment.23 These findings suggest that the type and degree of histologic infiltrates in canine IBD may not be as helpful as in human medicine, in which clinical scores correlate very well with histologic grading. Therefore, a new grading scheme for the histologic interpretation of endoscopically obtained biopsies from dogs and cats with IBD has recently been published by the WSAVA Working Group.24 The findings in this study suggest that microarchitectural changes seem to be much more important than cellular infiltrates when assessing histologic severity. However, there is limited information on how well this new grading system correlates with clinical disease. In one retrospective study, the interpathologist variability was still very high even when using the picture guide from the original publication.25 In addition, it is of concern that the only parameter that correlated with clinical disease was the presence of lymphangiectasia and hypoalbuminemia. Further prospective studies are warranted before the WSAVA scoring can be adopted as a useful tool for clinicians.",

In a study at the Royal Veterinary College, the author prospectively evaluated the accuracy of PARR for the diagnosis of intestinal lymphoma in biopsies obtained endoscopically from dogs in a comparison with the gold standard of histopathology and clinical outcome determined by follow-up information of at least 2 years. Samples from 39 dogs were included. PARR results indicated a clonal expansion in 7 of 36 dogs. However, these dogs were clinically healthy after dietary treatment 2 years after the endoscopy, so they clearly did not have lymphoma. The data from this study indicate a false-positive rate of almost 20% for PARR when performed on endoscopic biopsies. Another recent study has confirmed these findings, showing that in dogs with IBD, PARR results showed at least one oligoclonal pattern in 38% of dogs, and an immunoglobulin (7 of 47; 14.9%) or T-cell receptor (1 of 47: 2.1%) monoclonal pattern in 17% of dogs.26 The conclusion that a positive PARR test on an endoscopic biopsy means a diagnosis of lymphoma must therefore be made cautiously in a clinical situation, and clinical signs, response to treatment, and immunohistochemistry must also be taken into account.",

Boxers are predisposed to histiocytic ulcerative colitis, and German shepherd dogs (GSD) are predisposed to lymphoplasmacytic IBD.42 The author\u2019s group43 recently performed a mutational analysis of the canine genes for TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and NOD2 in GSD with IBD, and then further evaluated these in a case-control study with more than 50 cases and healthy GSD controls. Several mutations in TLR4 and TLR5 were found to be significantly associated with an increased risk of development of IBD. Moreover, these results were replicated in 38 other non-GSD breeds for the TLR5 mutation.44 A follow-up study showed that peripheral blood cells of dogs carrying the mutation are hyperresponsive to flagellin, which is the natural ligand for TLR5.45 This finding proves for the first time that a genetic mutation implicated in the pathogenesis of dogs with IBD has functional consequences at the protein level. Taken together, these findings make it very likely that TLR5 mutations are causally associated with canine IBD. Genetic testing for these polymorphisms currently is available only at the Royal Veterinary College. Such tests could become important for breeders and practitioners in the future. However, it is likely that in a multifactorial disease such as IBD in dogs, other genetic mutations and environmental factors also play a role in the pathogenesis. With the advent of genome-wide association studies, it is possible that more causative mutations will be identified.",

Some of these have been available for many years, such as serum albumin and cobalamin concentrations, as well as canine pancreatic lipase, and new data now show that these tests also may be prognostic indicators in animals with chronic enteropathy. Other tests have only relatively recently become available to practitioners, such as serum CRP, fecal \u03b11-PI, WSAVA standardization of histopathology readings, and PARR. The value of these tests needs to be evaluated in every clinical situation. New tests that are not yet widely available, such as pANCA, calprotectin, CD11c immunofluorescence, and genetic testing, may become very useful tests in the future.",
