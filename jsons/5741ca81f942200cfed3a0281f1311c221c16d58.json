The structures of carborane fluorinated polyesters (CFPETs) and polyurethanes (CFPUs) were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The thermal stability, mechanical properties, Shore A hardness, solvent resistance and acid-alkali resistance of the carborane fluorinated polyurethane films were also studied. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) tests manifested that the introduction of carborane groups into the main chain of fluorinated polyurethane endowed the obtained fluorinated polyurethane with excellent thermal stability. The thermal decomposition temperature of carborane fluorinated polyurethane (CFPU) increased by 190 \u00b0C compared with that of the carborane-free fluorinated polyurethane (FPU). Even at 800 \u00b0C, CFPU showed the char yield of 66.5%, which was higher than that of FPU (34.3%). The carborane-containing fluorinated polyurethanes also showed excellent chemical resistance and prominent mechanical property even after the cured films being immersed into Jet aircraft oil or 37% HCl for 168 h or at high temperature (700 \u00b0C). It is found that the structural characteristics of carborane group and the compacted structure of CFPU effectively improve the thermal stability, mechanical property, solvent resistance and acid-alkali resistance of the carborane-free fluorinated polyurethane. These excellent properties make CFPU as the useful raw materials to prepare the high temperature resistant coatings or adhesives for automotive engines, engine or fuel tank of aircraft and other equipment working in high-temperature or high concentrations of acid-alkali environments.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Fluorinated polyurethane (FPU) [1, 2] is a new class of functional materials synthesized by incorporating fluorocarbon chains into the molecular chains of polyurethane (PU) [3\u22125] .

In this regard, FPUs have great application prospects in the areas of protective coatings, paint industry, leather decoration and medicine [13\u221217] . In recent years, the study of fluorinated polyurethane has attracted considerable interest. As known, the main drawback of FPUs is that they cannot bear harsh environment, such as extremely high temperature and high concentration of acid-alkali corrosion. However, such properties are exactly required in the high-tech fields such as aerospace, aviation and military industry, etc. Hence, it is important to further improve the thermal stability and acid-alkali resistance of FPUs. One adopted approach for the improvement of thermal stability of polyurethanes is the structure modification by introducing organic heterocyclic groups into the main chains of polymeric diols and PUs, such as isocyanurates, oxazolidone, imide, etc. The effect of different organic heterocyclic groups on improving the thermal performance of polyurethanes has been reported [18\u221223] , but the most working temperature ranges of these polymers are still lower than 500 \u00b0C.

Meanwhile, the ultimate char yields (Y c ) of carborane-containing fluorinated polyesters CFPET-1 and CFPET-2 at 800 \u00b0C are 32.1% and 22.2%, respectively. Such data are superior to the carborane-free fluorinated polyester FPET-1 with a low char yield of only 6.0% under the same conditions. The high char yield and decomposition temperature of carborane-containing polyesters indicate that the carborane group can effectively reduce the degradation rate of carborane-containing polyesters.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 380, "end": 386, "text": "Fig. 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 895, "end": 902, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Thermal Stability of CFPU-1 and CFPU-2"}, {"text": "On the other hand, T5 and T 10 values and the char yield (800 \u00b0C) of CFPET-1 are higher than those of CFPET-2. These results demonstrate that the length of carbon chain connecting to the carborane group relates to the thermal resistance of carborane-containing polyester. The shorter the carbon chain lengths are, the better the thermal resistance of carborane-containing polyester will be. The reason may be that the fluorinated polyester with the shorter carbon chain has the stronger steric effect than that with longer carbon chain, which impedes the movement of molecules at high temperature. The results also coincide with our previous work [37] . Figure 5 shows the TGA curves of carborane-containing FPUs (CFPU-1 and CFPU-2) from carborane-containing fluorinated polyesters (CFPET-1 and CFPET-2) and HDI trimer with the molar ratio of NCO/OH = 1/1.5. The TGA curve of carborane-free fluorinated polyurethane FPU-1 is also given for comparison. For CFPU-1 and CFPU-2, there is obvious weight loss in the temperature range of 230\u2212400 \u00b0C, and the decomposition process includes three stages: (i) room temperature to 230 \u00b0C, the weight loss of small molecules and volatiles, (ii) 230\u2212490 \u00b0C, the disintegration of hard segment and soft segment (in particular, the urethane and ester bonds break down, producing H2O vapor and CO 2 ), (iii) 490\u2212800 \u00b0C, the thermal transformation of carborane group. FPU-1 loses its 5% weight at 141 \u00b0C, while CFPU-1 loses its 5% weight at 335 \u00b0C. T 10 value of CFPU-1 is 382 \u00b0C, which is also much higher than that of FPU-1 as shown in Table 3 . Meanwhile, the ultimate char yield (Y c ) of CFPU-1 at 800 \u00b0C is up to 66.5%, while the Y c value of FPU-1 is only 34.3%. Also, for CFPU-2, the values of T 5 , T 10 and Y c are all higher than those of FPU-1 under the same conditions. These results indicate that the carborane-containing fluorinated polyurethanes (CFPU-1 and CFPU-2) have higher thermal stability than carborane-free fluorinated polyurethane (FPU-1). On the other hand, Y c of CFPU-1 is only a little higher than that of CFPU-2 because the Y c of CFPET-1 is higher than that of CFPET-2. The high char yield and decomposition temperature of the carborane-containing fluorinated polyurethane indicate that the carborane groups can effectively reduce the degradation rate of FPUs and improve the thermal stability at elevated temperatures eventually. In order to check the structure variation of carboranecontaining fluorinated polyurethane at different temperatures, FTIR measurement was performed to analyze the structure of CFPU-1 sample thermally treated at 200, 300, 400 and 800 \u00b0C for 2 h in air, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6 , CFPU-1 exhibits characteristic absorption peak of B -H bond at 2600 cm \u22121 before thermal treatment, indicating that the carborane cage is intact after curing. After thermally treated at 200 or 300 \u00b0C for 2 h, the absorption peak of B-H bond still exists, meaning that the structure of carborane cage has not been destroyed. However, when the temperature is raised to 400 \u00b0C, this absorption peak almost disappears, indicating that the B-H bonds on carborane cage have been consumed completely at the elevated temperature. Meanwhile, the absorption peak at 1687 cm \u22121 also disappears at 300 \u00b0C, which means that the NHCOO group has been destructed [38] . However, two new broad absorption peaks at 1452 and 640 cm \u22121 appear in the spectrum as the temperature continues to increase, which are ascribed to the stretching vibrations of B-O-B and B-C respectively. The B-O-B and B-C cross-linkages are thermally stable, which improve the char yield and decomposition temperature of the fluorinated [31\u221235, 37, 38] . Therefore, after oxidation at elevated temperature, these carborane-containing fluorinated polyurethanes (CFPU-1 and CFPU-2) have high char yield and decomposition temperature than those of carborane-free fluorinated polyurethane (FPU-1).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 647, "end": 651, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3331, "end": 3335, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 3677, "end": 3692, "text": "[31\u221235, 37, 38]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 654, "end": 662, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF8"}, {"start": 1572, "end": 1579, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}, {"start": 2675, "end": 2681, "text": "Fig. 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}], "section": "Thermal Stability of CFPU-1 and CFPU-2"}, {"text": "For confirming the structure of oxidized CFPUs, X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was utilized to study the XRD patterns of CFPU-1 that were thermally treated at 200, 300, 400 and 800 \u00b0C for 2.5 h under air. When the CFPU-1 sample was thermally treated at 200 and 300 \u00b0C, no sharp crystalline peaks are observed, and the CFPU-1 sample exhibits amorphous structure (Figs. 7a and 7b) . When the thermal treatment temperature increased to 400 and 800 \u00b0C, the Bragg reflection at 2\u03b8 of 27.8\u00b0 (Figs. 7c and 7d ) was attributed to crystalline diffraction peaks of B 2 O 3 [32, 39, 40] . These XRD patterns indicate that the structure of the carborane cage had not been destroyed yet when the thermal treatment temperature was below 300 \u00b0C. However, when the temperature was elevated to 400 \u00b0C, the structure of carborane cage was destroyed and a more stable B 2 O 3 was formed. The above results coincide with the TGA curve of CFPU-1 (Fig. 5 ) and the FTIR spectra of CFPU-1 after thermal treatment at different temperatures (Fig. 6 ). When the temperature was lower than 400 \u00b0C, the carborane groups had not been pyrolyzed; only the carborane-free fragments were disintegrated into small molecules, resulting in a slow degradation process of CFPU-1. When the temperature was elevated to 400 \u00b0C, the carborane-free fragments were disintegrated eventually, giving rise to quick loss of the weight of CFPU-1. However, the trend of weight loss of CFPU-1 was put off because of the existence of carborane cages. Although the carborane cages underwent pyrolysis at 400 \u00b0C, they could form more compact oxidation B 2 O 3 layer, which was stable even at 800 \u00b0C.

It is worth noting that the cured CFPU-1 films have the highest tensile strength and the lowest of elongation at break among the three cured films, no matter whether or not these cured films were immersed into the media. The better mechanical property of CFPU-1 is attributed to the high rigidity of carborane in the main chain as illustrated in Fig. 15 . When CFPU-1 suffered external forces, the strong electron-deficiency of carborane made it more densified and compact. The steric effect of huge carborane cage caused the chain movement difficult, and the large size of the cage structure also had steric effect on the adjacent groups.
