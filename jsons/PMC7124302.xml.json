            "text": "Cry \u03b4-endotoxins produced by Gram-positive spore-forming Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are highly toxic toward a wide range of insect larvae [1]. Of particular interest, the Cry4Ba toxin from Bt subsp. israelensis is specifically active against mosquito larvae of the genus Aedes and Anopheles, vectors of various human diseases including dengue fever, chikungunya, yellow fevers and malaria [2], [3]. After ingestion by susceptible insect larvae, these Cry toxins which are produced as insoluble protoxins are solubilized in the larval midgut lumen (generally alkaline pH for dipteran and lepidopteran larvae) prior to their activation by gut proteases to yield \u223c65-kDa active toxins [2], [4]. According to all the known Cry structures, the activated toxins consist of three distinct functional domains: an \u03b1-helical bundle (DI), a \u03b2-sheet prism (DII) and a \u03b2-sheet sandwich (DIII). DI and DII have been revealed as membrane-pore formation and receptor recognition, respectively [5]. Recently, we have demonstrated that charge-reversal mutations at Asp454 (D454R and D454K) located within a receptor-binding loop of Cry4Ba-DII markedly increases the toxin activity against less-susceptible Culex larvae, suggesting a role of the charged side-chain in determining target specificity [6].",

This toxin-receptor interaction would promote toxin oligomerization and membrane-pore formation, resulting in midgut cell lysis and the eventual death of the target larvae [7]. Specific binding to their individual receptors is believed to be the critical determinant in Cry toxin specificity. In mosquito larvae, various membrane-bound proteins were identified as functional receptors for several Cry toxins, including Aedes and Anopheles cadherin-like proteins for Cry11Aa and Cry4Ba, respectively [8], [9], Aedes alkaline phosphatases (ALP) for Cry11Aa and Cry4Ba [10], [11], [12], Anopheles ALP for Cry11Ba [13], Aedes aminopeptidases N (APN) for Cry4Ba and Cry11Aa [14], [15] and Anopheles APN for Cry11Ba [16], [17]. Recently, the Cyt2Aa toxin from Bt subsp. darmstadiensis has also been reported as another binding protein for Cry4Ba to exert synergistic toxicity against Aedes aegypti larvae [18]. However, the structural basis for Cry4Ba toxin-receptor interaction is still unclear and need to be explored.",

To date, crystal structures of the M1 superfamily are available for various species, e.g. Escherichia coli (PDB ID: 2HPT), Plasmodium falciparum (PDB ID: 3EBG), Thermoplasma acidophilum (PDB ID: 1Z5H) and human (PDB ID: 2YD0) [20]. They all show similar overall structures, with domain II being the most conserved and domain IV the most variable [21]. In addition to being studied for their typical role in digestion, APNs have also been extensively studied as tumor-related targets, receptors for coronavirus and bacterial toxins [21], [7].",

In Anopheles and Aedes mosquito larvae, several APNs were also identified as putative receptors for the Cry4Ba, Cry11Aa and Cry11Ba toxins [14], [15], [16]. Here, three different full-length genes encoding AaeAPN2778, AaeAPN2783 and AaeAPN5808 were cloned from A. aegypti larval midgut RNA transcripts with specific primers using RT-PCR strategy. The PCR products obtained were of the expected sizes, i.e. 3003-bp for AaeAPN2778, 2868-bp for AaeAPN2783 and 2848-bp for AaeAPN5808 (Fig. 1\n, inset).

Also, another dipteran APN from Anopheles mosquito-larvae (AgAPN2) expressed in E. coli was shown not to have glycosylation for Cry11Ba binding [17] unlike some identified lepidopteran APNs that need the sugar moiety for binding to their toxin counterparts [7], [28].",

To quantitate this observation, cell viability assay was performed.

Cell mortality mediated by these two AaeAPNs was similar to AaeALP (31.7 \u00b1 2.8% cell mortality) which has been previously identified as a Cry4Ba receptor [12], suggesting that both AaeAPN2778 and AaeAPN2783, like AaeALP, share a common role as a toxin receptor mediating the Cry4Ba cytotoxicity. Moreover, this result was in agreement with our previous study that AaeAPN2778- or AaeAPN2783-knockdown larvae became less susceptible to the Cry4Ba toxin [14], strongly suggesting that these two APN isoforms serve as functional receptors for the Cry4Ba toxin in A. aegypti mosquito-larvae.",

These results also suggested that both AaeAPN isoforms were expressed in Sf9 cells as membrane-bound proteins. Taken altogether with the cytotoxicity results suggest that specific binding of Cry4Ba to its single counterpart (AaeAPN2778 or AaeAPN2783) is sufficient for mediating the toxin activity against individual receptor-expressing Sf9 cells without the need of pre-interaction with another receptor. Nevertheless, it has been shown both in vivo and in vitro for lepidopteran-specific Cry1A toxins that pre-binding of the toxin to cadherin-like receptors is required for toxin oligomerization prior to interacting with second membrane-bound receptors (e.g. APNs or ALPs) for insertion and pore formation [7], [30].",

This suggests that AaeAPNs displayed high structural conservation among the M1 aminopeptidase family. It should be noted that in the most variable domain IV there is no predicted N-/O-glycosylation site in the Thr-rich C-terminal stalk regions (see\nSupplementary Fig. 1) which are believed to be a part of Cry1A-binding regions for the lepidopteran APNs [7], suggesting different toxin-binding sites between lepidopteran- and mosquito-APNs. Interestingly, when compared the variable domain IV of these two AaeAPNs among insect APNs that have been reported as Cry toxin receptors including Lymantria dispar APN [31], M. sexta APN [32], H. virescens APN [26] and An. gambiae APN [17], the conserved negatively charged residues were found only on the two AaeAPNs: Glu734, Asp735, Asp775 and Glu802 for AaeAPN2778; and Glu724, Asp725, Asp765 and Glu790 for AaeAPN2783 (see\nFig. 4B, as indicated by *). These conserved-negatively charged patches placed them on the surface-exposed loops of both AaeAPN structures (Fig. 4C), possibly being involved in binding to the Cry4Ba toxin via ionic interactions and hence determining target specificity against Aedes larvae. Further studies, to better understand more critical insights into Cry4Ba toxin-receptor interactions, charged reversed mutagenesis on these putative interaction sites would be of great interest. Likewise, point mutations to positively charged side-chains on receptor-binding loop regions of the Cry4Ba toxin itself might perhaps improve the toxin activity and specificity against Aedes larvae, consistent with previous findings that Cry4Ba-charged-reversal mutants (D454R and D454K) exhibit increased binding affinity and larval toxicity to Culex larvae [6].",
