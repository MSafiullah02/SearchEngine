Actors (interchangeably called individuals) such as words, pieces of code, items in stock, routers in a network, employees, physicians, patients, trends in weather behavior, animals, humans, insects, genes, proteins, drugs, web pages, etc., can be grouped together into communities. Graphs form most attractive representation of social networks. The edges in a graph may represent social interactions, organizational structures, physical proximity, or even more abstract interactions such as hyperlinks or similarity, among others. The study of social networks has been extensively realized in the research community as we see more conferences emerging and more journals starting dedicated to the computing aspects of mining and analysis of social networks. This will then further interest in the field from more researchers who are willing to contribute to social network research.",

Realizing the social communities of dynamic and moving objects like stars, humans and animals, {e.g.}, [25] might require less effort. The actors in one community share something which distinguishes their community from the other existing communities. The overall structure of communities is in general hierarchical. For instance, humanity forms a single huge community sharing minimal characteristics of being human. This single huge community is composed of subcommunities that have further distinguishing characteristics which recursively split into subcommunities by considering further characteristics until we end up having each individual family as a community. In the same manner in a cell all the gene products form one large community which could be distributed into smaller communities by considering more features of the gene products. One gene product may belong to two or more communities and it would have a specific role within each community. Finally, social communities are mostly dynamic (whether modeled as stationary or dynamic actors) [9]; and hence the analysis of evolving communities is more demanding to cope with the dynamics of the changing network [9]. Data mining techniques have been effectively used to analyze and study social networks. The social network modeling framework described in this chapter is heavily based on data mining techniques.",

In general, data mining techniques are used for social network analysis where people who have similar social profiles are grouped together in social communities [47]; for instance, people may be grouped into small communities based on their income and exchanged emails. Data mining also involves the process of finding correlations in the data. For instance, data mining is used by companies to target their promotions to certain individuals based on the individuals' purchase history; it can also be used in market prediction where it is possible to predict the market status based on the history. One of the data mining techniques successful for such applications is clustering, which has been extensively studied in the literature [41].",

            "text": "Clustering may be supervised when the classes are known in advance; it is unsupervised when the classes are yet to be determined. The former is called classification and involves two major steps: model construction by using training data to build a model which is tested using remaining unseen data instances in order to determine its accuracy. On the other hand, clustering as unsupervised learning process does not rely on predefined classes and training examples while classifying the data objects. It is the duty of the clustering approach to decide on the classes. Clustering has been successfully applied to different domains, including customer classification, web data, financial data, spatial data, explanatory pattern-analysis and classification, grouping, decision making, document retrieval, gene expression data analysis, image segmentation, among others. Objects are clustered based on some similarity measures, namely homogeneity and separateness. Determining the number of clusters is a problem common to most of the existing algorithms. Usually the number of clusters is user defined. The best number of clusters can be defined by running the algorithm for different values of the number of clusters, and then choose the most appropriate value based on majority voting of some validation indexes. We further argue that even clustering algorithms that claim to run without the number of clusters predefined (like DBScan) still require specifying some parameters that guide the clustering process; tuning and deciding on the latter parameters is equally challenging as deciding on the best number of clusters. In this study, we use k-means clustering algorithm, which requires the number of clusters as input. We decide on the number of clusters by considering the result from applying frequent pattern mining as described in the sequel.",

We first cover bioterrorism and then describe how the social network model fits well for identifying disease biomarkers. We mainly concentrate on social communities of gene products. A gene can be defined as a string of nucleotides from the alphabet A, T, G, C, where each letter represents a chemical compound. Further details of genetics are out of the scope of this chapter. These genes are the functional segments of DNA that encode mRNA which generates the proteins. Genes form the basic unit for heredity and genetic material transformation. Surprisingly, recent research has revealed that less that 5% of the whole DNA sequence in human involves functional genes. The number of genes differs among organisms; for example, a human genome encodes approximately 20,500 genes, and yeast has around 6,000 genes.",

For instance, it is known that some proteins collectively function to maintain cellular protein conformation during stressful proteotoxic insults. Signaling pathways such as that regulating cell division can be thought of as a community. Likewise, investigating whole microbial communities instead of individual micro-organisms could guide scientists to answer fundamental questions such as how ecosystems respond to climate change or pollution. Actually, all the interactions between different organisms within an ecosystem must be taken into consideration in order to assess the environmental impact on microbial communities. This is not possible by following traditional approaches such as those which examine changes in gene expression of individual microbial cells. It is more realistic to investigate and analyze the gene expression of a whole community at once.",

The social network of gene expressions is watched over time in order to study the behavior of gene products: how they change camps to assume different functions, and how they affect other molecules within the cell. We employ different data snapshots related to the same set of gene products and collected from the same patients at different time points. A social network of the gene products is derived based on each snapshot. The different social networks are analyzed to identify and compare the expressed genes. The outcome will lead to highlight the benefit or thread caused by the analyzed genes.",

            "text": "A social network is derived by employing three perspectives. The first perspective is frequent pattern mining where gene expression and samples represent items and transactions, respectively. We utilize maximal-frequent sets of genes. In our discussion of the machine learning applications, the set of genes is frequent when it satisfies a minimum frequency threshold by having the genes concurrently expressed in a certain number of samples. It is closed if none of its supersets has the same frequency in the analyzed snapshot; it is maximal-closed if in addition to being closed, none of its supersets is frequent. The second perspective is the k-means clustering algorithm where the number of clusters k is set to the number of derived maximal-closed frequent sets of genes. The coexistence of two genes in the frequent patterns is used to decide on whether to have them connected in the social network, where we use the term \"gene\" simply as a label for the \"gene product\". When the two genes exist in the same cluster, the weight of the connection is set to the number of frequent patterns hosting the two genes concurrently; otherwise, the weight is set to the reciprocal of the latter value. The weight is adjusted further based on a third perspective which considers the data snapshot directly as discussed later in Sect. 2. The constructed social networks from all the data snapshots are to be investigated further to derive social communities that lead to better identification of biomarkers, where we define \"biomarker\" to be a \"biological property\", and not in the conventional sense of a biological predictor of clinical behavior. Though our results reported in this chapter are related to cancer biomarkers, the approach is general enough to be applied to identify biomarkers of other diseases should the corresponding data be available for modeling and analysis. The latter study has been left as future work. Finally, support vector machines (SVMs) are used to classify the given samples based on the identified biomarkers.",

For instance, in pharmacology the actors could be drugs, and two actors are connected if it is possible for them to appear together in the same prescription. In a university environment the actors could be students and two actors are connected if they are enrolled together in at least 3 courses during the current semester. Analyzing the first network will lead to communities of drugs that are used together and analysis of the second network will lead to communities of students who study together during the current semester. The identified students may then have the potential to be enrolled in the same courses in the future. The latter piece of information may be valuable in developing a recommendation system for students to select courses such that a set of courses is recommended to students who belong to the same community. The links may reflect either binary relationships (a missing link indicates no relationship) or weighted connections to indicate the strength or degree of the relationship (which may be negative or positive).

Another example involves students and courses as two sets of actors such that a student is linked to every course he/she is enrolled in.

The choice of which approach to follow depends on whether the interest is in studying the whole group at once or on identifying individual leaders and use them to influence the whole group. For instance, we may study the correlation between different terms in a book by analyzing how frequent the terms occur together in the same chapter of the book, and we may even fine-tune the analysis to consider sections or paragraphs instead of chapters. We may also study the social communities of actors in a play by analyzing how often they come together in the same scene or sketch.",

They should be armed with the knowledge that will guard them from being deceived by people and organizations which are mainly terrorists who may misuse their expertise and knowledge. As long as there are conflicts and competitions, people who feel themselves weaker and cornered like terrorists will preferentially choose easy to produce, transport and use harmful weapons, that is biological weapons. As long as there exist people who are willing to kill others, it will not be possible to eliminate biological weapons. Terrorists will always look for maximizing causalities and will not hesitate in using biological weapons once they get the ability to acquire them. In other words, ongoing efforts to use biological warfare has been more apparent in small radical organizations attempting to create fear in the eyes of large groups.

First, people should be warned not to be deceived by terrorists who try brainwash them and to turn them into dangerous individuals. Terrorists try to approach people emotionally by using different factors including poverty, political and ethnic discrimination, and religious speeches falsely manipulated to suit the propaganda of the terrorists. Thus, it is possible to avoid losing the fight against terrorism by concentrating on effective ways to handle the factors mostly misutilized by terrorists, by opening new job opportunities that will eliminate poverty, by appropriately dealing with all ethnic groups to address their concerns and meet their reasonable expectations and by spreading the right and true understanding of religion. Misunderstandings of religion has always created problems and conflicts. It is important to watch out for unknowledgeable scholars who play with the emotions of the youth and motivate them to turn into terrorist candidates. This issue is going out of control where it is easy for anyone to declare himself as a scholar and start spreading poison into the minds of the youth. Preventing this would be much easier than recovering and cleaning up the mess created by false propaganda. However international coordination and collaboration will be needed to effectively tackle the problem, especially with the widespread of the internet based propaganda and TV channels. Equally important is to have people feel that they are equally treated and not discriminated against. Preferential treatment to certain groups is one of the main items in the propaganda of terrorists. Second, people should be educated how to protect themselves from biological weapons and how to be treated in case they are affected. The latter issue has been addressed to some extent by different groups. For instance, Bronze [21] describes potential vaccines and pharmaceutical strategies for either prevention or treatment of established infections. Blank et al. [17] discussed how to learn lessons from the anthrax attacks of 2001 in order to react better to future bioterrorism attacks. The authors also analyzed the effectiveness of the distribution of antibiotics before and after an attack. Binder et al. [15] commented on the importance of using medicine and science as well as public knowledge to defend against bioterrorism.",

For each iteration, the weights associated with the genes are recalculated by a SVM test, and genes with the smallest weights are removed. On 8 and 16 genes, the classification error on the test set is zero. Jinyan and Wong [48] used new feature selection method called emerging patterns. When they applied their method on the AML/ALL data, they were able to identify one gene (zyxin), which was able to classify 31/34 of the samples.",

In the former model, 12% of the samples were misclassified and in the latter model 18% of the samples were incorrectly classified. Several other studies investigated the colon data set, e.g., [14]. At least four misclassifications occurred in most of the studies carried out. Many other groups have demonstrated the power of fuzzy logic in microarray analysis, e.g., [66, 75]; but the main problem of how to choose the fuzziness parameter m has to be further investigated. Usually 2 is the preferred value for m. However, Dembele and Kastner [26] have shown that 2 is generally not appropriate value for all data sets. Our group has already reported interesting results regarding the better choice of the values of m [6, 7].",

The intuition behind this is based on what is known as the Apriori-heuristic, which states that a set of items may be frequent if all its subset sets of items are frequent. This can be done by a self-join of the frequent sets of items of length k, say L\nk with itself and then pruning from the result any set of items which has all of its subsets not included in L\nk. This process results in generating a much smaller number of candidate sets of items. Therefore, candidate generation consists of two steps: the join step and the pruning step. After the pruning step, the remaining candidates are checked by scanning the database to determine their frequencies. This process is recursively repeated until it is not possible to construct more frequent sets of items.",

For each sample, we list the expressed genes as follows: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$s_1=\\{g_1,g_3,g_4\\}$$\n\\end{document}, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$s_2=\\{g_2,g_3,g_5\\}$$\n\\end{document}, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$s_3=\\{g_1,g_2,g_3,g_5\\}$$\n\\end{document}, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$s_4=\\{g_2,g_5\\}$$\n\\end{document}, and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$s_6=\\{g_3,g_5,g_6\\}$$\n\\end{document}. Assume the minimum support threshold is 2, i.e., a set of genes is said to be frequent if it is supported by at least two samples. Excluding the singleton frequent sets of genes, we could enumerate the following five frequent sets of genes: g\n1, g\n3, g\n2, g\n3, g\n2, g\n5, g\n3, g\n5, and \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\{g_2,g_3,g_5\\}$$\n\\end{document}.

Finally, only g\n1, g\n3 and g\n2, g\n3, g\n5 are maximal-closed frequent sets of genes. From this result, it is obvious that g\n3 is the most important gene; it has the highest closeness, betweenness and degree centralities. Further, the three genes, g\n2, g\n3 and g\n5 form a clique.",

Using the same data described in [27] social networks are constructed at times 9.5, 13.5 and 20.5 h with 500 genes. The corresponding networks are shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 3, respectively. To explicitly shown the change in connections, we also plotted part of each of the three networks by zooming in to shown certain genes where the three zoomed parts labeled with names of genes are shown in Figs. 4\u20136 respectively. These figures explicitly demonstrate the changes in the network; and hence the change in the correlation between the expressed genes.

We split this data as follows: 58 sample for training and 15 for testing. The colon cancer data studied has 2,000 genes and 62 patient samples with 40 tumor and 22 normal. Samples were split as follows, 48 samples were used for training and 14 samples were used for testing. As a normalization step, the intensity values have been normalized such that the overall intensities for each chip are equivalent. This is done by fitting a linear regression model using the intensities of all genes in both the first sample (baseline) and each of the other samples. The inverse of the \"slope\" of the linear regression line becomes the (multiplicative) re-scaling factor for the current sample. This is done for every chip (sample) in the data set, except the baseline which gets a re-scaling factor of one. A missing value means that the spot was not identified. Missing values were predicted according by to k-nearest neighbors strategy; we replace a missing value by the weighted average of the five nearest neighbors; we compute the weighted average by first dividing each of the five nearest neighbors by its distance from the missing value and the computed the average of the five produced values.",

Unfortunately, optimal methods that could closely evaluate the interactions between the genes and lead to the extraction of the actual social networks are still lacking. In this work, we tried to construct the social network of gene products by employing a three-pronged approach leading to a robust framework. For visualization, the reader may think of the simple model of two communities of genes within each cell\u2013one community containing expressed genes and the other community containing unexpressed genes for each particular cellular response to a stimulus. The community of expressed genes could be further divided based on the particular cellular goal of expressed genes (cell proliferation, metabolism, synthesis of a particular cellular product, etc.). The aim of our methods is to define the representative genes by analysis of the social communities. Our analysis allows us to find weighted links between genes based on their co-occurrence in the outcome from the three perspectives employed, namely frequent pattern mining, clustering and folding of the two-mode network. The outputs from the analysis of the social communities reported the most promising biomarker genes. After demonstrating its ability to identify potential cancer diagnostic biomarkers, the same methodology described in this paper can be applied to identify potential biomarkers of other diseases. Also, we are considering social communities of proteins as well as social communities that result from the interactions between genes and proteins. The latter networks are more challenging to study; these are at the center of our current research efforts.",
