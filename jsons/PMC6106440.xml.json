There are >400 reports of OPXV infection in domestic cats, but the total number of feline cases is considered to be much greater (5).

Analysis of 9 concatenated genes showed that the poxvirus detected was only distantly related to all CPXV lineages currently known and formed a separate cluster with respect to ECTV, with which it was strictly related and grouped with an OPXV strain recently isolated from captive macaques in Italy (42). These 2 viruses had lower genetic identity with ECTV than that observed with reference ECTVs and between variola minor virus and variola major virus. Therefore, these ECTV-like poxviruses likely represent a novel OPXV species. However, the true animal reservoir of this novel OPXV needs to be assessed, and the idea that wild rodents can act as carriers for the new virus cannot be ruled out.",

Alternatively, an ECTV strain might have escaped from laboratory mice and adapted to wild conditions. In addition, the zoonotic potential of the feline ECTV-like OPXV deserves an in-depth investigation. Feline poxvirus was also related to an unclassified OPXV, which was detected in a human in Italy almost 10 years ago and for which only partial HA gene has been identified (43). Consequently, this feline poxvirus could represent a threat to human health. Thus, veterinarians and cat breeders and owners should be aware of this additional risk associated with handling of cats with skin lesions.",
