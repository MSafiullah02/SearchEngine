            "text": "M a n u s c r i p t 3 SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has rapidly emerged as a worldwide cause of severe respiratory disease in adults. [1] Early reports indicate that the course of disease is generally milder in children, but fatal cases have been described. [2] [3] [4] Even in the setting of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection, children may represent a source of SARS-CoV-2 spread in community or hospital settings, so understanding the spectrum of COVID-19 illness in infants, particularly regarding conditions that result in hospitalization, is crucial to establishment of effective infection control interventions. [5] In the first months of life, infants presenting with fever frequently undergo diagnostic evaluations for invasive bacterial disease, even in the absence of other clinical signs. Such evaluations generally include cultures of blood, urine, and, in some cases, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), followed by observation and empiric antibiotic therapy in a hospital setting. [6] A significant percentage of febrile infants have infections with respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses, and influenza. [7] These viral infections may occur in the presence or absence of invasive bacterial infections. Over a oneweek period in late March 2020 corresponding to a time of widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City, we encountered two febrile infants presenting with minimal or no respiratory symptoms who were found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection without other etiologies despite thorough evaluations.",

Both parents were symptomatic with sore throat and subjective fever in the prior two days but had not sought medical attention for themselves. There were no other ill contacts and no known A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 4 contacts with SARS-CoV-2 infection. On examination, the patient was alert and active and was noted to have an erythematous, papular facial rash. The remainder of the physical examination was within normal limits. Samples of blood, urine, and CSF were obtained for analysis. Vital signs and pertinent laboratory findings appear in the A real-time RT-PCR assay performed at the New York State Department of Health detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the patient's NP sample. Empiric therapy with parenteral ampicillin and cefepime was started on admission and continued until the blood, urine, and CSF cultures were negative for >48 hours. No antiviral medications were given. The patient was discharged to home in stable condition with infection precautions consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.

The child had no respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms and had normal oral intake and activity level.

The epidemic coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, have the potential for spread within healthcare settings, making case identification and prompt isolation crucial to protecting patients, physicians, and staff. [9] [10] [11] In the context of an ongoing outbreak, we encouraged routine testing of febrile infants for SARS-CoV-2, even in the absence of respiratory symptoms. For both cases presented above, because SARS-CoV-2 testing was sent, and contact/droplet/eye shield precautions were instituted in the emergency department, with N95 masks used during NP swab collection because of the potential for aerosol generation. In addition, family members were required to wear surgical masks and upon discharge received instructions for home isolation. We did not find non-SARS-CoV-2 etiologies for fever in these two infants, and fever without localizing signs has been reported in older children with SARS-CoV-2. [5] Lymphopenia has been described in adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and we noted a low absolute lymphocyte count in Patient 2. [11] Testing for SARS-CoV-2 in non-NP samples was not performed in either child, and both infants had a benign clinical course. However, the need to routinely hospitalize febrile infants for workup of potential invasive bacterial disease may serve as an ",
