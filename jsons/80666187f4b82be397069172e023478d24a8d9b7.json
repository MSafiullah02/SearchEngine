PBMCs were chosen to perform the experiments because several studies indicated that SARS-CoV is able to infect in vitro PBMCs and to determine virus-specific RNA production [6] [7] [8] .

After adsorption at 37\u00b0 for 1 h, the excess virus inoculum was removed, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the wells topped up with medium plus 2% fetal calf serum (Sial, Italy) to 0.1 ml/well. Cells were cultured for 24 and 48 h after infection with SARS-CoV. As stated before, control experiments with VSV and NDV at the same MOI were carried out. For safety precautions, all culture supernatants, collected 24 and 48 h post-infection (p.i.), were UV irradiated for 1 h to inactivate residual infectious virus before IFN induction analysis. Cells were collected 24 and 48 h after virus infection and were frozen at -80\u00b0 for IFN-\u2423 subtype mRNA expression analysis (see below).",

Following incubation, cells were challenged with VSV at a MOI of 0.5 and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0 for 18 h. Virus-induced cytopathic effects were assessed by microscopic examination. The monolayer's cell was then stained with crystal violet in 20% ethanol. The dye taken up by the cells was eluted with 33% acetic acid and its absorbance measured at 540 nm with an ELISA microplate reader. IFN concentrations were expressed as inverse dilution that provided 50% of cell protection against viral-induced cytopathic effect. Figure 1 a shows the IFN-inducing capacity of SARS-CoV (HSR-1 strain).

The results of these experiments are shown in figure 3 where it can be seen that relevant amounts of different IFN-\u2423 subtypes can be measured in cells transfected as above. This observation indirectly underlines that SARS-CoV infection of PBMCs was accompanied by a low induction of IFN-\u2423 mRNA subtypes and suggests that toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) together with other pattern recognition receptors could be involved in the signaling leading to expression of type I IFN in PBMCs.",

The potential limitations of our study include the fact that we did not compare IFN response in SARS-CoV-infected PBMCs with those in other relevant human virus. In line with this, it has been reported that in contrast to human coronavirus 229E and influenza A virus (H1N1) there was little or no induction of IFN-\u2424 in SARS-CoV-infected macrophages [20] . Moreover, it has been shown that SARS-CoV infection of primary human macrophages is associated with a strong induction of chemokines without an associate type I IFN response compared to H5N1 infection [21] . This finding is consistent with the observation that SARS-CoV proteins that prevent IFN induction do exist [22] [23] [24] . In particular, the expression of nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV prevents Sendai virus-induced endogenous IFN-\u2424 mRNA accumulation without inhibiting dimerization of IFN regulatory factor 3, a protein that is essential for the activation of the IFN-\u2424 promoter [22] . Furthermore, nsp1 expression promotes degradation of RNA transcripts and host endogenous mRNAs, leading to a stronger host protein synthesis inhibition. In addition, Kopecky-Bromberg et al. [24] found that SARS-CoV open reading frame (ORF) 3b, ORF 6, and N proteins inhibit the expression of IRF-3, suggesting that, like other highly pathogenic viruses, SARS-CoV genome encodes more than one protein able to inhibit IFN.",

Moreover, it has also been reported by Okabayashi et al. [26] that the IFN system was not suppressed by SARS-CoV infection. The reasons for these discrepancies are still unclear. Several factors should be taken into account. These include differences in: (i) cells types used to investigate SARS-CoV capability to induce IFN; (ii) methods employed to determine IFN induction; (iii) timing of sample collections for the analysis of IFN induction with respect to SARS-CoV infections, and (iv) type of virus used to make a comparison with IFN production in SARS-CoV infection.
