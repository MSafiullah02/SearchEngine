            "text": "Innate immunity is the first line of host defense against pathogen invasion. For RNA virus infection, cytosolic viral RNAs are initially recognized by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) RIG-I and MDA5 (Yoneyama and Fujita, 2009). Recognizing RNA by RLRs triggers their activation and subsequent translocation to mitochondria where they interact with the common adaptor MAVS (also known as IPS-1, CARDIF, and VISA) (Kawai et al., 2005; Meylan et al., 2005; Seth et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2005), resulting in the formation of active MAVS polymers (Hou et al., 2011). MAVS then recruits various signaling proteins to form antiviral complexes, such as TRAF6 and TRAF3. The recruitment of TRAF6 to MAVS activates NF-\u03baB signaling, while TRAF3 binds to MAVS to promote TBK1/IKK\u03b5-mediated IRF3 activation (Belgnaoui et al., 2011). MAVS also interacts with another mitochondrial protein TOM70 for recruiting TBK1/IRF3 via chaperone Hsp90 to enhance the activation of IRF3 (Liu et al., 2010). These activation events of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 lead to the production of cytokines including type I interferons (IFNs), while the optimum activation also involves organelle antiviral platforms as well as many other molecules (such as RAVER1 and GSK3\u03b2) for association and cooperation in signaling (Lei et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2013). As the antiviral signaling hubs, mitochondria provide an appropriate environment for antiviral complex assembly, and mitochondrial location of MAVS is required for RLR-mediated IFN induction (Seth et al., 2005); while, in turn, MAVS functions as a sorting adaptor and further defines mitochondria as the central signaling sites (Kagan, 2012). Thus the signaling transduction spatiotemporally involves translocation of multiple cytosolic signaling proteins to mitochondria.",

            "text": "To circumvent host antiviral responses, viruses have evolved multifarious strategies at different levels of RLR signaling. Since mitochondrial relocation is a notable event for many signaling molecules, it is likely to be targeted by viruses for immune evasion. In the current study, we present an example of spatial isolation of TBK1/IKK\u03b5 from mitochondrial antiviral platform by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV). SFTSV is a novel phlebovirus of Bunyaviridae family, recently emerging in China (Yu et al., 2011). Human infection by SFTSV can cause severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) with a high fatality rate up to 30% (Yu et al., 2011). As an emerging deadly virus, SFTSV has posed a serious health threat. However, no antiviral drugs or vaccines are available at present, and little is known about the viral pathogenesis and virus\u2013host interactions in humans infected with SFTSV. Clinically, the production of IFNs was almost undetectable in the blood of patients (Li, 2011), suggesting that innate immune responses are suppressed effectively, which may contribute to viral systematic infection and pathogenesis. Like other phleboviruses, SFTSV is a negative, single-stranded RNA virus with a three-segmented genome. The large (L) and medium (M) segments encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and glycoproteins, respectively, while the small (S) segment uses an ambisense strategy to encode the nucleoprotein (NP) and the nonstructural protein (NSs). Bunyavirus NSs proteins are hypervariable in sequences, sizes, and encoding strategies, but they appear to have some conservative functions, such as regulation of viral replication and IFN antagonism (Schmaljohn and Nichol, 2007). SFTSV NSs might be involved in the suppression of IFN induction as well, but the mechanism was not fully elucidated (Qu et al., 2012).",

As shown in Figure 1B, NSs overexpression almost completely blocked SeV-triggered activation of ISRE, and the inhibition effect was even stronger than that mediated by the positive control, NS1 protein (Figure 1B). In contrast, the suppression of NF-\u03baB promoter induced by NSs appeared to be slight, compared with that caused by NS1 (Figure 1C). Similar results were obtained when TNF-\u03b1 was used to activate NF-\u03baB promoter (Figure 1D). We did not observe significant suppression of ISRE or NF-\u03baB promoter by other viral proteins. Thus, these data indicate that NSs functions as the IFN antagonist of SFTSV and likely mainly targets IRF signaling for the inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 induction.",

Under light microscope, the structures looked like compact granules. Further analyses of cells expressing EGFP-tagged NSs by confocal microscopy showed that they were solid and the EGFP-NSs fused protein was not limited on the surface of the structures (Figure 2B and C). Various types of mammalian cells were used for examining SFTSV infection with rabbit anti-NSs antiserum, and similar structures could be observed in SFTSV-infected cells, including Vero (green monkey kidney cells), HEK293 (human kidney cells), HepG2 (human hepatocytes), H9c2 (rat cardiac myoblasts), RAW264.7 (mouse macrophages), and DH82 (canine macrophage-monocyte cells) (Figure 2D and Supplementary Data).

Employing a finer temporal resolution for live-cell analysis, Hoenen et al.

Interestingly, we indeed observed that some of SFTSV NSs IBs were likely fusing, dispersing, or being linked with each other by a \u2018fiber\u2019, implying that NSs IBs might also undergo dynamic fusion or fission during their developments (Figure 2H). These findings suggest that SFTSV NSs IBs are distinct from aggresomes, but share some characteristics with the active IBs induced by some other viruses, in which viral or cellular proteins are compartmentalized but not damaged (Lahaye et al., 2009; Hoenen et al., 2012; Fricke et al., 2013).",

Sequence analysis revealed that SFTSV NSs also contains a conserved PXXP motif at its N-terminus (aa residues 66\u201369). Thus, we analyzed the role of this proline-rich motif in NSs location through replacing the proline(s) by alanine(s). Vero cells were transfected with plasmids expressing EGFP, EGFP-tagged NSs, or NSs mutants, respectively. Any single-point mutation at P66 (NSs P66A) or P69 (NSs P69A) did not prevent the formation of IBs, whereas simultaneous substitution of P66 and P69 (NSs PP) disrupted the formation of NSs IBs and rendered even cytoplasmic localization of the protein (Figure 3A). Next, we evaluated their capacities for suppressing ISRE and IFN-\u03b2 promoters. Intriguingly, NSs PP that was no longer able to induce IB formation lost most of the inhibitory activities as well, while single-point mutations were only slightly impacted and still strongly interfered with the activation of IFN-\u03b2 and ISRE promoters triggered by viral infection (Figure 3B). These results suggest that, similar to RVFV NSs, the N-terminal PXXP motif of SFTSV NSs is also required for IB formation, and localization and function of the protein. It is well known that the localization of NSs is required for NSs activity for RVFV. Here, the formation of SFTSV NSs IBs appears to be also required for NSs inhibitory activities against IRF signaling and IFN induction, as suggested by the clear correlation between NSs IB formation and NSs capacity of inhibition on reporter gene transcription.\n",

During virus infection, IRF3 is phosphorylated by TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, resulting in the dimerization and subsequent nuclear translocation of IRF3 as activated transcription factor. Since NSs appears to target IRF signaling, the activation of IRF3 was also investigated. Firstly, the level of IRF3 phosphorylation was evaluated by western blot (WB) analysis using a phosphorylation-speci\ufb01c antibody, anti-IRF3 (S396). SeV infection noticeably triggered IRF3 phosphorylation, which, however, was inhibited significantly by NSs expression (Figure 4A). Complementing the phosphorylation status, the effect of NSs on IRF3 dimerization was analyzed by Native-PAGE using an anti-IRF3 antibody. As shown in Figure 4B, SeV-induced dimerization of IRF3 was reduced by the expression of NSs. Virus-triggered nuclear translocation of IRF3 was also investigated by immunofluorescence. As indicated in Figure 4C, SeV infection resulted in the translocation of IRF3 from the cytoplasm to the nuclei, which was blocked in the cells expressing NSs. In contrast, NSs PP almost lost the capacity for blocking IRF3 nuclear translocation (Figure 4D and Supplementary Data). These results demonstrate that NSs indeed interferes with IRF3 activities.\n",

Since SFTSV NSs inhibited SeV-induced activation of IRF3, we hypothesized that NSs may interfere with RLR-mediated signaling pathway. To certify this, the NSs-expressing plasmid and plasmids expressing MDA5 or a constitutively active form of RIG-I (RIG-IN) were, respectively, transfected into HEK293T cells for reporter gene assays. The overexpression of RIG-IN or MDA5 could strongly activate the IFN-\u03b2 promoter, while co-expression of NSs inhibited the activation of IFN-\u03b2 promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5A and B), indicating that NSs indeed interferes with RLR signaling pathway.\n",

Additionally, since TBK1/IKK\u03b5 are crucial components at the convergence point of antiviral signalings mediated by several pattern recognition receptors, including RLRs, toll-like receptors (TLRs), and DNA sensors, it remains to be determined whether TBK1/IKK\u03b5 signalings at other subcellular sites are prevented by the spatial isolation in IBs as well.",

Coincidently, many of these viral proteins share two biological features: (i) interacting with certain critical signaling molecule(s) for which translocation to specific antiviral platforms is required for optimal antiviral signaling; and (ii) locating in specific subcellular sites (virus-induced or cellular structures) discrete from the proper antiviral platforms. For instance, NY-1 hantavirus Gn is associated with TRAF3 through its cytoplasmic tail (Alff et al., 2008) and locates in Golgi apparatus (Schmaljohn and Nichol, 2007); HCV NS2 that can interact with TBK1/IKK\u03b5 (Kaukinen et al., 2013) is resident in endoplasmic reticulum (Popescu et al., 2011); New World arenaviruse Z proteins binding RIG-I target to cellular membranes (Fan et al., 2010); and intriguingly similar to SFTSV NSs, Ebola virus VP35 that interacts with TBK1/IKK\u03b5 (Prins et al., 2009) is localized in viral IBs as well (Groseth et al., 2009). Previously, the physical mechanisms for antiviral signaling impairment were often proposed to be the inhibition of certain interactions or antiviral complex assembly via steric hindrance, competitive binding, or unknown means. In this study, we also detected the suppression of the interaction between the kinase IKK\u03b5 and upstream MAVS, but more importantly, spatial isolation was shown to be the further mechanism. It hence presents the first clear instance of spatial isolation from antiviral platforms and prompts the possibility that this may be the direct reason for the interruption of antiviral signaling at least in some cases, in consideration that the spatial isolation of the essential component(s) likely hinders interactions and complex assembly on antiviral platforms. Thus, spatial isolation from antiviral platforms may be a common and radical strategy employed by many viruses to interrupt host antiviral IFN signaling (Figure 8C).",

Here, we show IB formation in SFTSV-infected cells. We demonstrated that both SFTSV infection and NSs transient expression caused the production of intracytoplasmic IBs, which were eosinophilic and could be easily visualized using H&E staining (Figure 2). Although SFTSV could infect many cell lines, common cytopathic effects were not evident in most of these cells except for DH82 cells (Yu et al., 2011). Nevertheless, NSs-induced IBs could be observed under light microscopy in all types of mammalian cells detected in this study, including HeLa, HEK293, HEK293T, HepG2, Vero, Raw 264.7, H9c2, and DH82 cells (Figure 2 and Supplementary Data), indicating the likely general roles of NSs and IBs in multiple tissues and organs. Thus, the intracytoplasmic eosinophilic IBs may be conveniently used as a pathological marker for the recognition of SFTSV infection in cultured cells or for the clinical diagnosis. Additionally, the primary target organ(s) and cell(s) of SFTSV infection in humans are unknown, though functions of multiple organs, such as liver, kidney, heart, and gastrointestinal tract, were likely impaired (Yu et al., 2011).",

Apart from being involved in IFN-inducing signaling, IBs of several viruses also function in suppression of other cellular pathways. For instance, phosphorylated p38 (p38-P) and O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) were sequestered into IBs of human RSV, resulting in suppression of cellular responses to viral infection including MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) pathway and stress granule assembly (Fricke et al., 2013).

However, we did not detect significant suppressive activity of NP using our experimental system (Figure 1) and the reason for the discrepancy remains unclear. Additionally, we showed that NSs-mediated suppression of the NF-\u03baB element activation triggered by both SeV infection and TNF-\u03b1 treatment appeared to be slight, in comparison with the strong inhibition of the IRF-responsive element (ISRE) activation (Figure 1). Hence, NSs strongly inhibits IFN-\u03b2 induction mainly through ISRE activation but with slight influence on NF-\u03baB signaling, which we suppose is beneficial to virus survival, given that NF-\u03baB is required for efficient replication of SFTSV (Qu et al., 2012).",

As the largest RNA virus family, Bunyaviridae contains various notable viruses pathogenic in plants and animals including human, and many of them are emerging. Recently, another novel bunyavirus named Heartland virus that caused the severe disease with clinical manifestations similar to those of SFTS was discovered in Missouri, USA (McMullan et al., 2012). The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that Heartland virus is most closely related to SFTSV, and the sequences of their NSs proteins share >60% identity. Thus, it will be interesting to examine whether the NSs of Heartland virus functions similar to that of SFTSV showed in this study.",

TBK1/IKK\u03b5 are arrested by NSs and efficiently relocalized to the IB compartments, resulting in spatial isolation of the kinases from the mitochondrial platform and hence interruption of the signaling. (C) Spatial isolation of signaling molecules from antiviral platforms is likely a common viral strategy for immune evasion. This involves many viral proteins, such as Ebola virus (EBOV) VP35, hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS2, NY-1 hantavirus Gn, and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2013CoV) M, that interact with signaling proteins and locate at various cellular or virus-induced structures spatially isolated from antiviral platforms.",
