Heart, lung, kidney, liver, small intestine and colonic samples were collected for virological analyses and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.

Other viruses involved in common childhood diseases such as HSV, EBV, CMV, HHV-6, Parvovirus B19 and Enterovirus have also been detected in lungs, heart and CSF of deceased infants, but their involvment in the death remained sometimes uncertain [2], [3], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. VZV has been reported in only one case of SUID involving a healthy 17-month-old boy who unexpectedly died 3 days after onset of benign varicella. Enzyme-immunoassay with monoclonal antibodies to VZV revealed disseminated infection involving the skin, the lungs, the liver, the spleen and the gastrointestinal tract [26]. To our knowledge, the present case is the first description of a CMV and VZV co-infection in SUID.",

The morbidity rate is estimated at 4% and the mortality at 1 per 100,000 children, mainly due to viral or bacterial pulmonary superinfections [27], [28]. Several risk factors to develop a severe form of varicella were evidenced in the present case. The main risk factor was prematurity. Premature newborns tend to be at higher risk to develop a severe infection because of their lymphocyte-related immune system immaturity. Moreover, some studies have shown a link between the pregnancy term and the newborn's antibodies titers against VZV in an immune mother [29], [30]. Specific IgG antibodies are mainly transmitted to the fetus during the third trimester of the pregnancy leading to lower titer in a premature newborn. Furthermore, the antibodies decrease is faster in the first months following the birth of a premature than in an infant born on due term. It is noteworthy that in our case, the severe infection occurred despite maternal protecting antibodies against VZV. The protection level might have not been sufficient because of prematurity.",

Published studies also showed that qualitative PCR was not sufficient to determine the role of viruses in SUID [2], [3], [25], [34]. In our case, the use for the first time of virus quantitation in combination with histology permitted the assessment of the role of the viruses in the pathogenesis of SUID. Moreover, molecular tests were positive on frozen tissues, but not on paraffin-embedded tissues. This could be explained by modification of nucleic acids caused by formalin fixation. Indeed, this process can cause significant protein\u2013nucleic acid crosslinks as well as fragmentation of nucleic acids reducing the quantity and size of nucleic acids suitable for amplification [35]. Moreover, nucleic acids extract from paraffin-embedded tissues often contains remnants of substances that can inhibit the amplification reaction. These results showed that, without quantitative virology on frozen tissues, viral infection can be underestimated as a cause of death in SUID.",
