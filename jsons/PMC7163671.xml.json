Individuals are often co\u2010infected by a diverse infra\u2010community of pathogens, and interactions between pathogens can both alter infection patterns (Cattadori et al. 2008; Lass et al. 2013; Susi et al. 2015) and influence disease outcomes (Moss et al. 2008; Munson et al. 2008; Knowles 2011; Wejse et al. 2015). Pathogens infecting individuals in the first years of life may impact infection by subsequent pathogens (Fenton 2008; Randall et al. 2013; Rynkiewicz et al. 2015; Aivelo & Norberg 2018; Budischak et al. 2018). For example endemic pathogens that compete for the same resources as epidemic pathogens and can reduce the likelihood of infection (Randall et al. 2013) or, conversely, facilitate infection via immune suppression (e.g. Geldmacher & Koup 2012). The sequence in which pathogens infect an individual or \u2018priority effects\u2019 have been experimentally shown to be important in shaping co\u2010infection dynamics in a variety of systems (e.g. Hoverman et al. 2013; Halliday et al. 2017), yet are rarely demonstrated in non\u2010experimental contexts. How priority effects and pathogen traits (e.g. transmission mode) affect the nature and frequency of associations between endemic and epidemic pathogens, ultimately shaping pathogen infra\u2010communities is a knowledge gap that has significant consequences for understanding patterns of infection (Munson et al. 2008; Telfer et al. 2010; Ezenwa & Jolles 2015; Halliday et al. 2017).",

Discriminating between positive (i.e. two pathogens are more likely to occur together) or negative associations (i.e. two pathogens are less likely to occur together) between pathogens in populations is complicated by the short time window that a pathogen is shedding (and thus detectable with molecular methods) and by potentially confounding host immune environments (Tompkins et al. 2011). This is particularly the case for microparasites where pathogen detection often relies on serology, and, thus, without resampling the same individual, the precise timing of exposure cannot be estimated. Detection of pathogens that form chronic infections may be more straightforward as the infection is active for longer periods, but deducing pathogen associations is difficult without extensive longitudinal data (Fenton et al. 2014; Hellard et al. 2015). Identifying whether two pathogens are associated due to host\u2013habitat preferences, the increasing likelihood of exposure with age, or are a product of a negative (e.g. competition) or positive (e.g. facilitation) interactions is methodologically challenging (Poulin 2007; Johnson & Buller 2011; Fenton et al. 2014; Hellard et al. 2015; Clark et al. 2016).

Studies commonly aggregate pathogen data to genus level, but associations between pathogens can be subtype or genotype\u2010specific (e.g. Wejse et al. 2015; Benesh & Kalbe 2016; Brook et al. 2017). For example individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus subtype 1 (HIV\u20101) are four times more likely to become co\u2010infected with tuberculosis compared to individuals with HIV\u20102 (Wejse et al. 2015). Beyond subtype or genus, genotype\u2010specific associations have been demonstrated in snails infected by trematodes (Louhi et al. 2015) and in rodents infected by Bartonella bacteria (Brook et al. 2017). Infra\u2010community dynamics are also likely to vary with spatiotemporal scale. In general, associations between free\u2010living species are more apparent at scales where interactions occur compared to broader spatiotemporal scales (Eltonian noise hypothesis; Peterson et al. 2011; Ara\u00fajo & Rozenfeld 2014), but it remains unclear if this is true for pathogens. Nonetheless, for cross\u2010sectional datasets, important patterns may be missed unless multiple spatiotemporal scales are considered (Ovaskainen et al. 2017). To overcome these challenges, analytical approaches that can quantify associations between pathogens, whilst controlling for potential confounding factors are required to assess the role of associations in shaping pathogen infra\u2010communities.",

Network measures have frequently been used to study food webs but are increasingly applied to pathogen infra\u2010communities where nodes are pathogens, and edges represent pathogen co\u2010occurrences within the host (Vaumourin et al. 2015). Networks are modular if pathogens co\u2010occur more frequently in particular groups, \u2018nested\u2019 if pathogens frequently share interaction partners across the network, or \u2018segregated\u2019 if the inverse is true (Strona & Veech 2015; Ulrich et al. 2017). If, for example networks are segregated, targeted control of one \u2018keystone\u2019 pathogen may lead to co\u2010extinction of other pathogens in a module (Pedersen & Fenton 2007; S\u00e4terberg et al. 2013).

Here we use both co\u2010occurrence networks and JSDMs to examine the structure of pathogen\u2010pathogen networks and quantify pathogen associations while controlling for environmental/host factors and scales. We include information on pathogen traits such as transmission mode to assess what role they played in the distribution of each pathogen. We collate 10 years of cross\u2010sectional data on endemic and epidemic pathogens in 105 African lions (Panthera leo) as well as extensive host and environmental data from the Serengeti Lion Project (SLP, Packer et al. 2005). The SLP datasets provide a unique opportunity to understand pathogen co\u2010occurrence networks in a wild population while controlling for group, individual and environmental characteristics. We use this data to ask the following interlinked questions at two levels of taxonomic resolution:\nTo what degree is the pathogens\u2019 co\u2010occurrence network of Serengeti lions nested or segregated?After accounting for environmental/host factors and spatiotemporal scale, is the type of endemic pathogen an individual is infected by early in life associated with exposure to epidemic pathogens later in life?Are there significant endemic\u2013endemic or epidemic\u2013epidemic pathogen co\u2010occurrences?\n",

The co\u2010occurrence network detects clusters of pathogen sharing amongst individuals and screens for disconnected nodes (pathogens that rarely co\u2010occur with others), while the JSDM approach was used to quantify pathogen\u2013pathogen associations. To assess the plausibility of these putative interactions, we compare our findings to similar mammalian pathogens in experimental studies.

Many of the pathogens have been previously classified as endemic or epidemic (Packer et al. 1999). We supported our classification with age\u2013prevalence plots (Fig. S1) and we plotted yearly prevalence (Fig. S2) for the pathogens not previously classified. Pathogens with a high prevalence at a young age (\u2264 2 years old) with little fluctuation across all years and age classes were considered to be likely endemic, whereas an increasing age\u2013prevalence relationship and high temporal variation were classified as more likely to be epidemic in this population. Feline coronavirus can have epidemic and endemic cycles, and it is challenging to assess which form the individual was infected with from serological data, but based on age\u2013prevalence relationships we categorised coronavirus as an endemic infection (Fig. S1). Furthermore, we used patterns of age\u2013prevalence to infer the potential timing of infections. As most individual lions were likely to be infected by the pathogens we considered endemic within the first 2 years after birth (Troyer et al. 2011, Fig. S1), we assume that endemic exposure typically occurred prior to exposure by an epidemic pathogen. We partitioned the endemic pathogen data into two sets based on taxonomic resolution (high and medium). The high taxonomic resolution dataset encompassed FIVPle genotype and Babesia species data, whereas the medium resolution dataset aggregated FIVPle subtype information and Babesia data to genus level.",

We constructed co\u2010occurrence networks for each taxonomic resolution as well as for pathogens tested for using qPCR and by serology in cases combining both lines of diagnostic evidence led to altered network structure. To do so, we first built an m \u00d7 n matrix that described presences/absences (i.e. occurrences) of both endemic and epidemic pathogens across individual lions, where m was the number of individual lions and n the number of pathogens. By multiplying it by its transpose, we then created a summary n \u00d7 n co\u2010occurrence matrix that described, for each pair of pathogens, the number of observed co\u2010occurrences across all individual lions. Pathogens detected infrequently in this lion population were included in this analysis to help screen for pathogens disconnected in the network. The co\u2010occurrence matrix was used to evaluate which pathogens were carried by the same individuals utilizing a modularity\u2010based \u2018greedy\u2019 approach (Clauset et al. 2004). Measures of modularity aim to determine the adequacy of different classification schemes in representing clusters and divisions in datasets; here, the clusters represented the co\u2010occurrence of pathogens in individual hosts. Estimates of modularity were calculated for each possible classification by comparing the expected fraction of pathogen co\u2010occurrence to random co\u2010occurrences (Newman 2006).

JSDMs can quantify associations between species across scales using latent factor models to estimate species\u2013species covariance for each random effect (Ovaskainen et al. 2017; Bj\u00f6rk et al. 2018). We fitted JSDMs for both high and medium taxonomic resolution datasets, combining information on environmental and host covariates as fixed effects (see \nConfounding variables below for details), to the occurrence data for each of the pathogens. Pathogens detected fewer than five times were excluded from this analysis leaving 10 pathogens in the medium taxonomic model and 17 in the high\u2010resolution dataset. Including pathogens with fewer than five occurrences may lead to spurious associations (Ovaskainen et al. 2017). We fitted all the JSDMs with Bayesian inference, using \u2018Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities\u2019 (Blanchet et al. 2018). For each analysis, we modelled the response pathogen co\u2010occurrence matrix using a probit model based on the approach outlined in Ovaskainen et al. (2016). In contrast to the network approach, the JSDM co\u2010occurrence matrix is a product of the pathogen\u2010to\u2010pathogen variance\u2013covariance matrix estimated for each random effect (e.g. pride\u2010year) in the model. Each random effect (and thus each estimated co\u2010occurrence matrix) measures a component of the variation in the response that is different than the other random effects and of the set of explanatory variables (fixed effects) considered in the model. In our models, we added individual (e.g. sex and age), pride and environmental characteristics (see \nConfounding variables below) as fixed effects. Individual sampled, pride\u2010year (i.e. which pride and year the individual was sampled in) and year\u2010landscape (i.e. what year was the individual sampled in the Serengeti) sampled were added as random effects. As pathogen traits may shape the distribution of each pathogen (e.g. similar environmental and host variables may shape tick\u2010borne pathogens), we included traits such as pathogen type (see Table 1) in each analysis. We utilised the default priors (described in full detail in Ovaskainen et al. 2017) and ran the HMSC model twice using 3 million MCMC samples (the first 300 000 of which being burn\u2010in). Each run was carried out using a different seed. Visual inspection of MCMC traces and the Gelman\u2013Rubin diagnostic calculated to assess convergence. In addition, we made sure that the effective sample size (ESS) of each parameter was > 200.",

In contrast, the medium resolution network was completely nested with no modularity (\u019d\u0305 = 1, modularity index = 0, z = \u221e, P = 0) and no significant clusters (Fig. 1b).",

Using age\u2013prevalence relationships we could assess the likely order of infection using cross\u2010sectional data. We found that the particular endemic pathogen an individual is infected by as a cub may have consequences for which novel epidemic pathogen the individual is infected with later in life (Fig. 3).

Nonetheless, RVF did cluster separately from the other pathogens tested via serology which potentially indicates that RVF, unlike the other epidemic viruses, has a distinct epidemic cycle with most of the interacting partners being more chronic pathogens. This is supported by the RVF association profile detected in our JSDM analysis and is intuitive given that RVF is the only mosquito\u2010borne pathogen that we sampled. Even though we sampled pathogens considered important for lion health, we lacked data on other potentially pathogenic bacteria, helminths and fungi that the lions were exposed to or potentially infected by. Furthermore, symbiont interactions can also be important in shaping pathogen dynamics (e.g. Halliday et al. 2017) and could be considered in pathogen infra\u2010community studies. These additional taxa may lead to further segregation in the network, as larger and more diverse networks typically show increased modularity and segregation (Thebault & Fontaine 2010; Sauve et al. 2014). Expanding sampling to construct a more complete microbe and macroparasite network would also capture a broader array of potentially facilitative and competitive associations (Ezenwa 2016; Aivelo & Norberg 2018).",

Co\u2010infections between bunyaviruses like RVF and retroviruses are likely common in humans and wildlife, though there are surprisingly few studies addressing the topic. In contrast, relationships between dengue virus (a flavivirus) and HIV are relatively well understood. Flaviviruses and HIV share similar immune receptors that can inhibit HIV replication and the molecular machinery used to do so may be a viable way to control HIV infection (e.g. Xiang et al. 2009). Given the overall structural similarity of flaviviruses and bunyaviruses (Hernandez et al.2014), it is possible that a similar mechanism underlies the association in lions between RVF and FIVPle that we observed, although we show that this association was subtype specific. If this was true, RVF might inhibit FIVPle B infection \u2013 counter to our assumption that endemic pathogens in our system infected each individual first (Fig. 3).",

We found that all tick\u2010borne haemoparasites showed positive associations with CDV including B. leo (with insert) despite its low prevalence in 1993/1994 (Fig. S9). Parvovirus was also positively associated with CDV, but this was likely due to similarities in timings of epidemics with a parvovirus epidemic in 1992 just before the 1994 CDV epidemic (Packer et al. 1999). Parvoviruses are also immune suppressive, and so the timing of the parvovirus outbreak may also have contributed to the CDV/Babesia\u2010induced mortality. The general negative relationship between FIVPle C and CDV/Babesia supports the theory that individuals infected by subtype C were more likely to die in the consequent Babesia/CDV outbreak (Troyer et al. 2011).

Negative associations between retroviruses and coronaviruses are rarely reported, yet there are plausible molecular pathways. HIV\u20101 and human coronaviruses (HCoV) share remarkably similar binding receptors (Chan et al. 2006) and some mild HCoV strains are even considered a viable vaccine against HIV (Eriksson et al. 2006). This may explain the negative association we detected for FIVPle B and coronavirus but does not explain the positive association between FIVPle C and coronavirus we detected across scales. The mechanism driving FIVPle subtype specific relationships with coronaviruses remain unclear, and as coronaviruses infecting lions are also likely to be genetically diverse, examining the genetic structure of coronavirus may help untangle these associations further. In contrast, competitive associations between HIV strains are well characterised with HIV\u20101 found to outcompete HIV\u20102 for blood resources (Ari\u00ebn et al. 2005). For FIVPle, even though co\u2010infection is relatively common (Troyer et al. 2011) competition between subtypes could be important as there is anecdotal cell culture evidence that FIVPle B can propagate more rapidly than FIVPle C (M.

Even though B. gibsoni and B. felis show similar age prevalence profiles (Fig. S1), the prevalence of B. felis over time was relatively stable compared to the other protozoa (Fig. S10). Differences in the host range for individual Babesia species and potential host differences in virulence may partially explain these patterns. For example B. felis has only ever been detected in felids, whereas B. gibsoni has a much broader host range including canids (Penzhorn 2006). Generalist pathogens may have greater pathogenicity as there can be reduced selective restraint on virulence particularly in \u2018dead end\u2019 hosts (Woolhouse et al. 2001).

The inability to distinguish mortality or correlated exposure (i.e. an individual is infected by multiple pathogens in the same transmission event) from negative or positive associations is one of them, and careful interpretation of associations is necessary. Incorporating approaches such as structural equation models that explicitly include potential mechanisms that underlie candidate pathogen associations (Carver et al. 2015) could be a valuable additional step in future pathogen network studies. Another weakness is the inability to estimate the timing of these infections more precisely. For example the negative association between RVF and H. felis could be due to temporal differences when ticks and mosquitoes emerge after rains. Years with higher rainfall increase mosquito abundance thus increasing RVF prevalence (Fig. S2), whereas ticks emerge en masse when rains follow a dry period potentially increasing H. felis prevalence (Munson et al. 2008). As rainfall was calibrated to the year of sampling rather than the age of infection (which could differ) the JSDM approach could not capture this variation. Studies using longitudinal data to quantify associations using a similar framework to ours (e.g. Telfer et al. 2010; Henrichs et al. 2016) will be beneficial as they are likely to provide more robust estimates of the order of infection in wild populations. Furthermore, we cannot quantify the importance of these associations in shaping pathogen distribution across scales compared to processes such as host density. Lastly, incorporating immune function and host resources in both the summary network and JSDM analyses are likely to provide mechanistic insight into pathogen network structure (Griffiths et al. 2014). Higher resolution pathogen traits, such as duration of infection, are likely to provide further mechanistic insight into how and why pathogens co\u2010occur as they do in free\u2010living communities (Ulrich et al. 2017). However, given the daunting complexity of pathogen infra\u2010community dynamics, our two\u2010step approach can assess broad network structure and identify useful candidate interactions between pathogens thereby reducing some of this complexity.",
