The results of docking suggest that they have similar interaction mechanism. The most active compounds of these four types of inhibitors could both form several hydrogen bonds with residues His90, Arg513, Leu352 and Arg120, and develop hydrophobic interaction with residues Phe518, Leu352 and Leu359. This is consistent with the investigation reported by R. G. Kurumbail et al. (Nature. 1996, 384, 644-648). A common 3D-QSAR model could be constructed with these four categories of COX-2 inhibitors using the method of docking-guided conformer selection.",

The results show that this model possesses good predictive ability for diverse COX-2 inhibitors. Furthermore, a HQSAR model was used to evaluate the influence of substituents on anti-inflammatory activity. Compared with the results of previous works, our model possesses significantly better prediction ability. It could help us to well understand the interaction mechanism between inhibitors and COX-2 receptor, and to make quantitative prediction of their inhibitory activities.",

            "text": "In human body inflammation appears when immune system is attacked by virus (for example coronavirus, influenza ...). It is necessary to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanism for the goal of designing new drugs. COX-1 and COX-2 are two cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms [1] . Their principal pharmacological effect is inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. This discovery led to the hypothesis that side effects such as ulcers and renal failure associated with the clinically used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are caused by the inhibition of COX-1. Whereas COX-2 is an inducible enzyme, it is mainly produced during inflammation processes [2] . Then the study of selective inhibition of COX-2 led to a new class of anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic drugs with significantly reduced side effects. Recent works suggest that inhibiting COX-2 could also be an important anti-cancer strategy [3] and could be used to delay or slow down the clinical expression of Alzheimer\u00d7s disease [4] . But extended use of NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may increase the risk of developing Alzheimer disease up to 80% [5] . Therefore we need to develop more specific and efficient COX-2 inhibitors with improved safety profile [6] .",

Firstly, the ligand SC558 was extracted from the cyclooxygenase complex, and then the remaining COX-2 receptor structure was completed by adding the missing polar hydrogen atoms and residues. This structure was optimized with constrained CoMFA/CoMSIA/HQSAR and Docking Study of the Binding Mode of Selective Cyclooxygenase (COX-2) ... molecular dynamics. Partial atom charges of COX-2 receptor were calculated with Kollman-all-atom approximation [24] . Gasteiger-H\u00b8ckel charges were calculated for all inhibitor molecules, as recommended in the AutoDock 3.0 package which was used for performing automated docking of inhibitors to COX-2 receptor. The development and the principle of this software have been described elsewhere [25 \u00b1 26] . During the docking process, a series of the docking parameters were set on.

The most active molecules for four types of inhibitors (oxazoles, pyrazoles, pyrroles and imidazoles) were selected to study the binding mode with COX-2 receptor. The complexes formed by A9 of oxazoles, B2 of pyrazoles, C13 of pyrroles and D59 of imidazoles with COX-2 receptor were then investigated, as shown in Figure 2 . For all complexes, two oxygen atoms of sulphonamide are linked by hydrogen bond to residues His90 and Arg513. This is consistent with the investigation reported by R. G. Kurumbail et al. [6] . Beside these hydrogen bond interactions, there are also hydrophobic effects around sulphonamide group bonded to phenyl with the residues Phe518, Leu352, Leu359, Trp387 and Met522. This hydrophobic interaction seems to be favourable to the activity. The other residues such as Tyr355, Tyr385 and Ser530 are polar. The electrostatic interaction between these residues and phenyl ring could stabilise the formed complex. Except the complex of C13, there is one hydrogen bond between the nitrogen atom of sulphonamide and carbonyl oxygen of Leu352. This may explain that the sulphonamide containing compounds are more active than those containing sulphomethyl. In the complexes of A9 and B2, there is also electrostatic interaction between halogen atom and residue Arg120. It is perhaps why the anti-inflammatory activity of A9 and B2 is higher than that of D59. For B2-COX complex, there is a hydrogen bond between nitrogen atom of pyrazole ring and \u00c0 OH of residue Tyr355 with 127.88 for N \u00a5\u00a5\u00a5 H \u00c0 O angle and 2.85 \u00e4 for N \u00a5\u00a5\u00a5 H distance. These values (angle < 1408 and distance > 2.0 \u00e4) suggest that this hydrogen bond should be very weak and does not significantly contribute to stabilise the complex. By contrast, for A9 complex, electrostatic interaction between the chlorine atom located in phenyl para position and the residue Trp387 could increase the interaction between ligand and receptor. This leads to the higher activity for A9 compared with B2. The docking study is in agreement with experiments. It seems that the antiinflammatory activity increases with the number of hydrogen bonds for these four compounds, as shown in the following sequences:",

The aim of this analysis was to examine whether the 227 compounds can be gathered into a unique model or must be split into different sub populations according to their structural features.

The cross-validated q 2 values of CoMFA and CoMSIA models of training set for this model are 0.748 and 0.638, respectively. The parameter of CoMFA for model 5 is much higher than that of model 6. It suggests that CoMFA model is sensitive to the orientation of investigated training set, while the orientation of aligned compounds has little influence to CoMSIA model [30] . The parameters of model 5 for CoMFA and CoMSIA approaches are similar to those of model 4. This shows that the method of docking-guided conformer selection could eliminate the influence of orientation for CoMFA model. This docking-guided conformer selection seems to be a valuable method to search for the active conformers and build 3D-QSAR model.

This could explain that A7, A15, A21, A37, A39, A40, A44, A46, A51, B16, B19, C11, C17, C20, D75, D82 and D102 with \u00c0 CH 2 OH, \u00c0 CH 2 COOH, \u00c0 SH, \u00c0 OH, \u00c0 NH 2 , \u00c0 CONH 2 , \u00c0 CHO substituents at position 2 of the fivemembered cycle are less active than molecules bearing \u00c0 CF 3 groups. In our docking investigation, we find that these former substituents with polar hydrogen at position 2 could form hydrogen bond with the residue Arg120 of COX-2, while the sum number of hydrogen bond between ligand and receptor is less than the compound with substituents \u00c0 CF 3 . Therefore their binding free energies are lower than the latter one. Previous literature did not report why these compounds have low activity [11 \u00b1 12] . Electrostatic (redcolored) and hydrogen bond acceptor fields near the substituent of five-membered heterocycle at position 3 show that electronegative groups could increase the activity and hydrogen bond acceptor groups decrease it. Compounds of B1 ( \u00c0 Cl), B2 ( \u00c0 F) and B17 ( \u00c0 Cl) have higher activity than B6 ( \u00c0 OH) and B14 ( \u00c0 NH 2 ). This agrees with the indication of CoMSIA model. There are red-colored, cyan-colored and magenta-colored regions near the para substituent of the six-membered aromatic ring in position 4. It shows that polar, hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups are favorable to the activity. This suggests that these molecules with substituents \u00c0 SO 2 NH 2 on position 4 are more active than those with \u00c0 SO 2 CH 3 . The result is in agreement with our docking investigation discussed above. Five-membered heterocycle is buried in a white-coloured contour, showing that hydrophobic interaction between residues and this ring is unfavourable to activity. The para substituent of phenyl at position 5 is near magenta-coloured, green-coloured and yellow-coloured (hydrophobic field) contours, suggesting that hydrogen bond acceptor, hydrophobic and bulky groups could increase anti-inflammatory activity. This could explain that compounds A2(4-Cl), A3(4-Br), A9(4-Cl), A10(3,4-Cl 2 ), A29(4-F), B40(4-SMe), B44(4-NMe 2 ), D10(4-Cl) and D11(4-F) are more active than A19, A23, A26, A28, B5-B15, molecules lacking substituent at the same position. There are blue-coloured, green-coloured and yellow-coloured (hydrophobic field), red-coloured (hydrogen bond acceptor field) areas near the meta substituent of phenyl at position 5. This shows that electropositive, bulky and hydrophobic groups are favourable to activity while groups with hydrogen bond acceptor are unfavourable. The CoMSIA model indicates that bulky substituents at ortho position of 5-phenyl are unfavourable to the anti-inflammatory effect. The activity of compounds have the order 21(2-F) <B23(4-F), B27(2-Me) <B29(4-Me), B36(2-OMe) < B37(4-OMe), B42(2-NMe 2 ) <B44(4-NMe 2 ), D30(2-Cl) < D14(3-Cl) and D33(2-OMe) <D19(3-OMe), in agreement with the bulk of the substituents.",

Hologram length values were a set of prime numbers ranging from 53 to 401. The parameters of this HQSAR model are gathered in table 11 . Table 11 shows that the least standard error occurs at a cross-validated q 2 of 0.409 with six optimal components, with a hologram length of 353, the conventional r 2 of PLS analysis being 0.685. The correlation between experimental and predicted anti-inflammatory activity for training and test compounds is shown in Figure 12 approach gives no more than a very rough description of the relationship between structure and anti-inflammatory activity. The contribution of some fragments to activity is shown in figure 13 . A9 is an example of active compound and A46 is one of less active ones. The sulphonamide fragment brings a positive contribution to anti-inflammatory activity. This is in consistent with the molecular docking investigation. A methyl group at position 2 is favourable for activity. For A46, we could find that the fragment \u00c0 NH2 gives a negative contribution to activity. This agrees with the CoMSIA model. Our HQSAR not only can testify the reliability of our 3D-QSAR but also complement it.",

[15] studied these four types of COX-2 inhibitors (table 1 \u00b1 7) with 2D-QSAR, and proposed a set of linear regressions between experimental activity and physicochemical parameters. In their regression equations, the anti-inflammatory activity is significantly correlated to hydrophobicity and polarization of the molecule. The contribution of hydrophobic and electrostatic fields in our CoMSIA model is 0.531, which shows that, among the five used parameters, hydrophobic and electrostatic fields are the main factors affecting activity. The calculated activities are listed in table 9 and 10. The correlation between EA and calculated activity (CA) is shown in Figure 14 (A) for the all anti-inflammatory activity data. In this former work, the correlation coefficient r 2 between EA and CA was 0.695 and standard error 0.653, while the corresponding correlation coefficient r 2 of our CoMFA model 4, including training and test set, is 0.884, and the standard error 0.396. This shows that our model has better predictive ability. A CoMFA study of similar compounds has been reported by Chavatte et al [11] . Three fields (steric, electrostatic and lipophilic) were used for constructing 3D-QSAR models. But the fields related to hydrogen bond (donor and receptor) were not taken into account. In the present work, docking study allowed us to understand the different interactions between ligand and the receptor. Application of CoMSIA method provided more detailed information including the hydrogen bond effects and the contribution of different fields. In fact, the result of CoMSIA shows that the contribution of hydrogen bond donor plays also a significant role, as important as the electrostatic field. The predictive ability of our models seems to be better than the reported ones.",

Docking inhibitors into COX-2 indicates that the most active compounds in each family form three hydrogen bonds between two oxygen atoms of sulphone and residues His90 and Arg513. This is consistent with the investigation reported by R. G. Kurumbail et al. The superposition of the docked conformations for the four types of compounds shows that these COX-2 inhibitors may have a similar interaction mechanism with COX-2 receptor, leading us to define a common 3D-QSAR model for these four types of COX-2 inhibitors. The most probable conformations were selected by a docking-guided conformer selection method. Then partial (one per family) and global (gathering the four families of compounds) 3D-QSAR models were built. For global 3D-QSAR model, the cross-validated q 2 values are 0.741 and 0.632; and conventional r 2 values 0.887 and 0.885 for CoMFA and CoMSIA.",

The meanings of the different colours are indicated in figure caption. Red-coloured and a little bluecoloured regions near position 2 of the five-membered heterocycle show that electronegative substituents at the position 2 could be favourable to biological activity. This can explain why structure (A9) containing a CF 3 substituent at position 2 has higher anti-inflammatory activity than A2 (2-Me), A5 (2-CH 2 OMe) and A30 (2-Me). The activity of B1 (2-CF 3 ) is larger than that of B16 (2-CH 2 OH), B17 (2-CN), B18 (2-COOMe) and B19 (2-CONH 2 ). The compounds C13 (2-Br), C14 (2-Cl), C18 (2-CH 2 OC 6 H 4 -4-Cl) and C10 (2-SO 2 CF 3 ) with electronegative substituent have higher activity than other analogues of pyrrole. For the imidazole compounds, there is a similar phenomenon. The activity of compounds D1 (2-CF3), D79 (2-CH 2 OC 6 H 4 -4-Cl) and D80 (2-CH 2 SC 6 H 4 -4-Cl) is larger than those of compounds D73-D84.
