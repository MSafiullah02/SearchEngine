The outbreak of COVID-19 in China has caused mental health problems among the public in China[3] and Japan[4] and medical workers in Wuhan[5]. The National Health Commission has released guideline for local authorities to promote psychological crisis intervention for patients, medical personnel, people under medical observation and civilians during the COVID-19 outbreak[6]. However, what type of mental disorders are prevalent and how they distribute among population are not know. So, a rapid assessment of outbreak-associated mental disorders for both civilians and health care workers, is needed[7].",

Besides, many self-media and netizens also release and transfer related information on social media, such as WeChat and Weibo. Social media may lead to (mis)information overload[8,9], which in turn may cause mental health problems. WHO pointed out that identifying the underlying drivers of fear, anxiety and stigma that fuel misinformation and rumour, particularly through social media[10]. Previous studies indicated that indirect exposure to mass trauma through the media can increase the initial rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms[11]. A previous study also shown social media exposure may positively related to forming risk perceptions during the MERS outbreak in South Korea[12]. But there was no study to examine the association between social media exposure and mental health problems. So, the current study aims to describes the prevalence and distribution of two major mental disorders-anxiety and depression among Chinese population [13], and examine their associations with social media exposure by rapid assessment during COVID-19 outbreak.",

Participants are asked to report the presence of these positive feelings in the last 2 weeks on a 6-point scale ranging from all of the time (5 points) to at no time (0 points). A summed score below 13 indicates depression[14]. Anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7)[15,16], which consists 7 symptoms. Participants were asked how often they were bothered by each symptom during the last 2 weeks. Response options were \u201cnot at all,\u201d \u201cseveral days,\u201d \u201cmore than half the days,\u201d and \u201cnearly every day,\u201d scored as 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

This study also found that 82.0% of participants frequently expose them to social media, and frequently SME associated high odds of anxiety and CDA, which is consistent with previous studies [11]. there may be two reasons explaining the association between frequently SME and mental health. During COVID-19 outbreak, disinformation and false reports about the COVID-19 have bombarded social media and stoked unfounded fears among many netizens[20], which may confuse people and harm people\u2019s mental health[9]. Besides, many citizens expressed their negative feelings, such as fear, worry, nervous, anxiety et al. on social media, which are contagious social network[21,22]. So, WHO\u2019s \u2018infodemics\u2019 team is working hand in glove with countries\u2019 communications department to deliver information to a broader public audience[23]. Finally, we also found that SME was not different between participants from Hubei province and others, but the formers faced higher odds of anxiety. It indicated that participants from Hubei province- the infectious focus directly expose to public health emergency, and may suffer more mental health problemes[17,19]. Compared with the control measures taken by other cities, Wuhan have sealed off the city from all outside contact to stop the spread of the COVID-19. As the prevention and control measures called new standard by WHO[24], the lockdown of Wuhan is a very effective way to interrupt the transmission of the virus, however, the strictest measures in Wuhan might lead to more serious mental health problems of local people.",
