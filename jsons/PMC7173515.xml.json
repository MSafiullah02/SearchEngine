            "text": "Vaccines, similar to other pharmaceutical products, undergo extensive safety and efficacy evaluations in the laboratory, in animals, and in phased human clinical trials before licensure.30, 31 Phase I trials usually involved smaller numbers of subjects and are able to detect only extremely common adverse events. Phase II trials generally enroll several hundred people in each vaccine arm, as in the comparative infant diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine trials,32 and provide data on the impact of antigen content, number of vaccine components, vaccine formulation, effect of successive doses, and profile of common reactions. These data can inform the choice of the candidate vaccines for Phase III trials.33, 34 Sample sizes for Phase III vaccine trials are often based on efficacy considerations, and resultant safety data are dependent on the sample size (approximately 102 to 105) and the duration of observation (often <30 days).33 Typically, only observations of rates of common local and systemic reactions (e.g., injection site swelling, fever, fussiness) are feasible. The experimental design of most clinical trials includes a control group (a placebo or an alternative vaccine) and the detection of adverse events by researchers who are \u201cblinded\u201d to which vaccine the patient received. This allows relatively straightforward inferences on the causal relationship between most adverse events and vaccination.35\n",

            "text": "Several ways of enhancing prelicensure safety assessment of vaccines have been developed. One of these ways includes the Brighton Collaboration (www.brightoncollaboration.org), which was established to develop and implement globally accepted standard case definitions for assessing adverse events following immunizations.36 Without such defined standards, it was often difficult, if not impossible, to compare and contrast safety data across trials. The Brighton case definitions for each adverse event are further arrayed by the level of evidence provided (insufficient, low, intermediate, and highest); therefore, they also can be used in settings with fewer resources (e.g., studies in less-developed settings or postlicensure surveillance). For example, in the large multisite Phase III infant DTaP trials, definitions of high fever across trials varied by temperature (39.5\u00b0C vs 40.5\u00b0C), measurement (oral vs rectal), and time (measured at 48 vs 72 hours).37 This was unfortunate because standardized case definitions had been developed in these trials for efficacy but not for safety, even though the safety concerns provided the original impetus for the development of DTaP.38, 39\n",

            "text": "There has been a greater recognition of the need for much larger safety databases before licensure. Because of pragmatic limits on the sample sizes of prelicensure studies, there are inherent limitations to the extent to which they can detect very rare, yet real, adverse events related to vaccination. Even if no adverse event has been observed in a trial of 10,000 vaccinees, one can only be reasonably certain that the real incidence of the adverse event is no higher than one in 3333 vaccinees.40 Thus, to be able to detect an attributable risk of one per 10,000 vaccinees (e.g., such as the approximate risk found for intussusception in the postlicensure evaluation of the simian\u2013human reassortant rotavirus vaccine, RotaShield vaccine), a prelicensure trial of at least 30,000 vaccinees and 30,000 control subjects is needed. Both second-generation rotavirus vaccines (the bovine human reassortant vaccine, RotaTeq, and the attenuated human rotavirus vaccine, Rotarix) were subjected to Phase III trials that included at least 60,000 infants.41, 42 While these trials were adequately powered to detect intussusception at the rate seen with RotaShield, they were not adequately powered to detect the rates ultimately seen with either RotaTeq or Rotarix. In addition, the cost of such large safety trials could limit the number of vaccine candidates that could be studied.43\n",

VAERS lacks data on the denominator of total number of people vaccinated and the corresponding data on number of cases and denominator population of unvaccinated people. Sometimes reporting rates can be calculated by using VAERS case reports for the numerator and, if available, doses of vaccines administered (or, if unavailable, data on vaccine doses distributed or vaccine coverage survey data) for the denominator. These rates can then be compared with the background rate of the same adverse event in the absence of vaccination, if available.

The CISA mission is to improve understanding of adverse events following immunization at the individual patient level. CISA serves as a vaccine safety resource providing expert consultation on clinical vaccine safety issues and with its partners conducts studies to identify risk factors and preventive strategies for vaccine adverse events, particularly in special populations.28 The CISA investigators bring in-depth clinical, pathophysiological, and vaccinology expertise to assessing causal relationships between vaccines and adverse events,127 and to understanding the pathogenesis of adverse events following vaccinations. The CISA investigators have published a standardized algorithm for evaluating and managing persons who have suspected or definite immediate hypersensitivity reactions such as urticaria, angioedema, and anaphylaxis following vaccines.128 Some of the studies undertaken by CISA include an assessment of extensive limb swelling after DTaP,129 a study of the usefulness of irritant skin test reactions for managing hypersensitivity to vaccines,130 the clinical evaluation of patients with serious adverse events following yellow fever vaccine administration,131 and evaluation of vaccine safety among children with inborn errors of metabolism.132, 133 New understanding of the human genome, pharmacogenomics, and immunology hold promise for future CISA studies and may make it possible to elucidate some of the biological mechanisms of vaccine adverse reactions, which, in turn, could lead to the development of safer vaccines and safer vaccination practices, including revaccination when indicated.134\n",

Thus, it is important to have background rates available of expected adverse events to allow rapid evaluation of whether reported adverse events are occurring at a rate following immunization that is higher than would be expected by chance alone.

The emergence of a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus prompted the development of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) monovalent vaccines. The FDA licensed the first 2009-H1N1vaccines in September 2009. With potentially hundreds of millions of people expected to be vaccinated, adverse events were anticipated to occur in some recently vaccinated people. To address the question of whether the vaccine could be causing the adverse events, background rates for several adverse events were developed.137 To rapidly detect any unforeseen safety problems, the federal government implemented enhanced postlicensure 2009-H1N1 vaccine safety monitoring,138 including in VAERS and VSD. A new collaboration was initiated that also performed rapid ongoing analyses similar to VSD and included the databases of several large health insurance plans, the Department of Defense, Medicare, and the Veterans Administration. In addition, active case finding for GBS was conducted in 10 areas of the United States with a combined population of approximately 50 million people. Initial safety data were provided by VAERS, which found that the adverse event profile after 2009-H1N1 vaccine in VAERS (>10,000 reports) was consistent with that of seasonal influenza vaccines.91, 138 Combined results from the U.S. monitoring systems found 1.6 excess cases of GBS per 1 million vaccinations, which is similar to the increased risk found with some seasonal influenza vaccines.139\n",

It is often not possible to infer causality in individual cases of adverse events following immunization, except in certain special situations. Circumstances in which a causal association in individual cases can reasonably be inferred include: (a) local reactions at a vaccine injection site; (b) immediate hypersensitivity reactions (in absence of other exposures); (c) recurrence\u2013same adverse event recurs in same individual following repeat exposure to same vaccine; (d) isolation of vaccine virus (from typically sterile site), as, for example, Urabe mumps vaccine and aseptic meningitis; and (e) a unique clinical syndrome, such as vaccine-associated paralytic polio.",

As highlighted in Table 82.3\n, the adverse reactions for which there is strong evidence of a causal association with recommended childhood vaccines in the United States are few and tend to occur rarely. Newer vaccines and certain other vaccines, however, were not covered in the latest IOM review in 2012. This gap was addressed by a systematic review of the literature commissioned by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.144 That review identified a few additional adverse events where the evidence favors a causal association, including rotavirus vaccines and intussusception, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and febrile seizure, hepatitis A vaccine and purpura, and varicella vaccine and thrombocytopenic purpura.",

In the mid-1980s, the antivaccine group Dissatisfied Parents Together raised the notion that the whole-cell pertussis vaccine could cause SIDS. In the early 1990s, when the hepatitis B vaccine was recommended for routine use in newborns, a popular television news program raised the question of whether vaccines could cause SIDS. SIDS peaks between 2 and 3 months of age, a time when infants are receiving a relatively large number of recommended vaccinations; thus, it would not be unexpected to observe a coincidental close temporal relationship between vaccination and SIDS. SIDS deaths in the United States have been declining since the early 1990s for a variety of reasons, including recommended changes in sleeping position.160 This downward trend in SIDS has also been observed in SIDS reports submitted to VAERS.161 Considerable evidence supports the notion that vaccination is not causally associated with SIDS,162, 163, 164, 165 including an IOM review in 2003 that rejected a causal association between the whole cell pertussis\u2013containing vaccine and SIDS and between exposure to multiple simultaneous vaccines and SIDS.145\n",

That evidence was based in part on concomitant use studies required by the FDA prior to licensure of a vaccine.

In one study of 1366 infants with wheezing during infancy, vaccination with DTP and other vaccines was not related to the risk of wheezing in full-term infants.243 In another study of more than 165,000 children, childhood vaccinations were not associated with an increased risk for developing asthma.244 Finally, a study from Finland also suggested that children with a history of natural measles were at increased risk for atopic illness. Such findings run contrary to the hypothesis that the increase in atopic illnesses seen in several countries is a consequence of the reduction in wild measles resulting from immunizations.245\n",

Results of studies examining the potential associations between administration of inactivated influenza vaccine and various surrogate measures of asthma exacerbation, including decreased peak expiratory flow rate, increased use of bronchodilating drugs, and increase in asthma symptoms, have yielded mixed results. Most studies, however, have not supported such an association.246 In fact, after controlling for asthma severity, acute asthma exacerbations were less common after inactivated influenza vaccination than before,247 and inactivated influenza vaccination seems to be associated with a decreased risk for asthma exacerbations throughout influenza seasons.248 Several more recent studies have also shown a lack of correlation between receipt of vaccines and the development of asthma.249, 250, 251, 252\n",

            "text": "Probably one of the most contentious issues in recent years has been speculation that vaccines cause autism. Autism is a chronic developmental disorder characterized by problems in social interaction, communication, and responsiveness and by repetitive interests and activities. Although the causes of autism are largely unknown, family and twin studies suggest that genetics has a fundamental role.253 In addition, overexpression of neuropeptides and neurotrophins has been found in the immediate perinatal period among children later diagnosed with autism, suggesting that prenatal or perinatal influences or both have a more important role than postnatal insults.254 However, because autistic symptoms generally first become apparent in the second year of life, some scientists and parents have focused on the role of MMR vaccine because it is first administered around this time. Concern about the role of MMR vaccine was heightened in 1998 when the Lancet published a study based on 12 children that proposed an association between the vaccine and the development of ileonodular lymphoid hyperplasia, nonspecific colitis, and regressive developmental disorders (later termed by some as \u201cautistic enterocolitis\u201d).255 Among the proposed mechanisms was that MMR vaccine present in the intestinal tissues caused bowel problems, leading to the malabsorption of essential vitamins and other nutrients and eventually to autism or other developmental disorders. Concern about this issue led to a decline in measles vaccine coverage in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.256 Significant concerns about the validity of the study included the lack of an adequate control or comparison group, inconsistent timing to support causality (several of the children had autistic symptoms preceding bowel symptoms), and the lack of an accepted definition of the syndrome.257 Subsequently, population-based studies of autistic children in the United Kingdom found no association between receipt of MMR vaccine and autism onset or developmental regression.258, 259 Soon after publication of the Lancet article that ignited the controversy,255 two ecologic analyses found no evidence that MMR vaccination was the cause of apparent increased trends in autism over time260, 261; in addition, two other studies found no evidence of a new variant form of autism associated with bowel disorders secondary to vaccination.262, 263 Several newer studies also refuted the notion that MMR vaccine caused autism.264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269 Perhaps the most powerful study involved younger siblings where the older child had autism; in this study, receipt of MMR vaccine did not increase the risk of autism in the younger child.270\n",

Mercury is a naturally occurring element found in the earth's crust, air, soil, and water. Certain types of bacteria in the environment can change inorganic mercury to organic mercury (methylmercury). Methylmercury makes its way through the food chain in fish, animals, and humans. At high levels, it can be neurotoxic. Thimerosal, however, contains ethylmercury, not methylmercury. Studies comparing ethylmercury and methylmercury suggest that they are processed differently; ethylmercury is broken down and excreted much more rapidly than methylmercury. Therefore, ethylmercury is much less likely than methylmercury to accumulate in the body and cause harm.",

Concerns about CRPS have been limited to a few case reports in Japan that received considerable media attention.311 Similar cases have not been reported from other countries. An expert review committee in Japan determined that information was not adequate to make a definitive diagnosis of CRPS in many of the reported cases and a causal relationship to vaccination could not be established.312 A review by the European Medicines Agency concluded that the evidence does not support a causal association between HPV vaccines and CRPS or postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.313\n",

A case-control study in France found no increased risk of several autoimmune outcomes (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, central demyelination, GBS, connective tissue disorders, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and autoimmune thyroiditis) following HPV vaccination.319 An analysis of national data from Sweden and Denmark covering 4 million women, including nearly 800,000 who had received HPV4, found no increased risk of multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating diseases following HPV4 vaccination.124 Arguably, the HPV vaccine has been subjected to greater scrutiny postlicensure than most other vaccines.",

Furthermore, immunization is unlike most other medical procedures in that the consequences of the decision affect not only the individual person, but also others in society. Because of this important distinction, many countries have enacted immunization laws that, in part, are meant to limit an individual person's right to infect others. Without such mandates, persons may attempt to avoid the risks of vaccination while being protected by the herd immunity resulting from others being vaccinated.351 Unfortunately, the protection provided by herd immunity may disappear if too many people avoid vaccination, resulting in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.352, 353 Debates in the United States, where such laws are created and enforced at the state level, have focused on whether philosophical (in addition to medical and religious) exemptions to mandatory immunizations for school entry should be more or less restrictive, and what standards for claim of exemption are needed.349, 354, 355 For example, in 2015, California removed all nonmedical exemptions to school-entry vaccination requirements beginning in the 2016\u201317 school year.356 Thus, vaccine risk communications should not only describe the risks and benefits of vaccines for individuals, but also should include discussion of the impact of individual immunization decisions on the larger community.",

Parents who sought medical attention for any of their children owing to an apparent adverse event following immunizations (6.9%) not only expressed more concern about immunizations, but also were more likely to have a child who lacked one or more doses of three high-profile vaccines compared with parents who reported that none of their children had experienced an adverse event following immunization.374 Two scenarios were seen as plausible. It may be that parents who were already concerned about vaccines before their child began the vaccination schedule sought medical attention for minor side effects (e.g., fever) or nonrelated problems. It is also possible that an apparent adverse event following immunization that resulted in parents seeking medical attention for their child caused the parents' perception of vaccines to become more negative. Both possibilities may result in parents declining future vaccines for their children. It is also important to note, however, that a physician's personal experience, with both vaccinations and vaccine-preventable diseases, can also be influential in helping reluctant parents understand the importance of on-time vaccination.375 Education and descriptions of vaccine-preventable diseases may also help parents balance the perceived risks of vaccines with the risks of vaccine-preventable diseases.376\n",

VISs are the cornerstone of provider\u2013patient vaccine risk\u2013benefit communication. Each VIS contains information on the disease(s) that the vaccine prevents, who should receive the vaccine and when, contraindications, vaccine risks, what to do if a side effect occurs, and where to go for more information. Current VISs can be obtained from the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases386 and are available in a number of languages other than English from the Immunization Action Coalition (www.immunize.org). An increasing number of resources that address vaccine safety misconceptions and allegations also have become available, including websites, brochures, resource kits, and videos (Table 82.5\n). Some studies have been conducted to assess the use and effectiveness of such materials364, 365, 387, 388, 389; however, more research in this area is needed.",

Healthcare professionals are also in the best position to help all parents provide evidence-based comfort measures to children to reduce acute pain and anxiety associated with vaccines.393 It is also important to convey to those who refuse recommended vaccines that their decision is not without risk, and that they (or their children) are vulnerable to a vaccine-preventable disease and its possible consequences.",

This would then push the parents above a theoretical \u201cunacceptability threshold\u201d in which they would choose not to have their children immunized with one or more vaccines. One study181 found that many parents whose children were fully vaccinated were \u201cat risk\u201d for vaccine delay or refusal based on their concerns about the safety or necessity of vaccines. Furthermore, vaccination is not a one-time, all-or-nothing decision, but rather an ongoing series of choices over time.",

In guidance for clinicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend physicians remove nonvaccinating families from their practice, but it does give them permission to do so.394a Instead, American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that pediatricians should listen carefully and respectfully to parents' immunization concerns, factually communicate the risks and benefits of vaccines, and work with parents who may be concerned about a specific vaccine or having their child receive multiple vaccines in one visit.395 Providers can make a huge impact on vaccine acceptance, resulting in a cascading effect in which providing information can increase trust and increasing trust can lead to greater acceptance of and confidence in vaccines. For healthcare providers to be able to optimally fill this important role, however, two related issues need to be addressed. The first is the need for quality communication courses and training in medical schools and residencies and training programs for medical and public health professionals regarding vaccine safety.396, 397, 398 The second is for MCOs and medical insurance companies to adequately reimburse physicians for health education. Lack of reimbursement to physicians has been noted as a barrier to implementation of behavioral treatments for health issues such as heart disease399 and smoking.400 It is important to note that studies show that education programs can be a cost savings to healthcare systems.401, 402 We live in a world already benefiting from vaccines that exist, and there is the promise of more vaccines to come. The challenge we have now is to make sure that the promise is not lost because we did not present the benefits and risks of vaccines in a meaningful way acceptable to the public.",

Combined with the difficulties associated with identifying rare, delayed, or insidious vaccine safety problems in prelicensure studies,35 the well-organized consumer activist organizations,408 Internet information of questionable accuracy,337, 338 media eagerness for controversy,339, 409 and relatively rare individual encounters with vaccine-preventable diseases virtually ensure that vaccine safety concerns are unlikely to go away. The existence of a robust vaccine safety monitoring system is essential for providing assurance of the safety of currently marketed vaccines and for rapidly identifying and responding to potential safety problems. Currently, SRSs, such as VAERS, serve as the frontline systems for the early identification of vaccine safety problems. Such systems could be improved if reporting were more complete. Application of web-based and text messaging technologies could make reporting easier and more accurate and also enable more active follow-up of vaccinated persons.410 Alerts built into electronic medical record systems411 could also improve reporting to VAERS, as could linkages with immunization registries. Some of these advances will be particularly important to enable monitoring vaccine safety in mass vaccination campaigns during which vaccinations may be administered primarily outside of the traditional healthcare system.",

Pregnant women, however, are usually excluded from prelicensure clinical trials, making postlicensure monitoring key for evaluating safety of maternal immunizations. Currently in the United States, only two vaccines are routinely recommended for all pregnant women, inactivated influenza and combined tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) vaccines,413, 414 although other vaccines recommended for women of reproductive age are sometimes administered during pregnancy when the need arises. Evidence indicates that influenza and Tdap vaccines are safe when administered during pregnancy.415, 416, 417, 418 Safety data, however, are more limited on vaccination in the first trimester of pregnancy and for repeat Tdap vaccination at short intervals. Safety monitoring will also be important when anticipated new vaccines, such as group B streptococcus, respiratory syncytial virus vaccines,419, 420 and possibly meningococcal vaccines are introduced for use in pregnancy.",

Although immunization levels of U.S. children are high, a sizable fraction of parents do not have their children fully immunized, and concern about vaccine safety is the leading reason for underimmunization. These concerns persist despite the scientific evidence that vaccines do not cause autism or a host of other conditions that have been alleged to be caused by vaccines, such as asthma, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases. Thus, it is critically important that public health agencies, medical organizations, and other influential authorities continue to focus on the safety of vaccines and assure public confidence by providing clear, consistent messages on vaccine safety concerns; supporting effective and transparent vaccine safety monitoring systems and research activities; providing review and recommendations by respected independent expert groups on vaccine safety controversies; and engaging advocacy groups in constructive and open dialogue about their vaccine safety concerns. Although the efforts of government, medical, and other authorities are important, it is healthcare providers who have the greatest influence in determining the acceptance of vaccines by individual people. Even among parents who believe that vaccines may not be safe, most will have their children vaccinated if they have a trusting relationship with an influential healthcare provider.

However, like all medical interventions, vaccines are not completely without risk of side effects or other adverse outcomes. A timely, credible, and effective monitoring system, coupled with prompt action in response to identified safety problems, is essential to preventing adverse effects of vaccination and to maintaining public confidence in immunizations. Because immunizations are typically administered to healthy people and are often recommended or mandated to provide societal and individual protection, vaccines must be held to a very high standard of safety. Vaccine safety monitoring and research should optimally be able to detect potentially very small levels of increased risk, especially for adverse events that can result in death or permanent disability. The ultimate goal of such research, including the application of new developments in biotechnology, is to develop safer vaccines and vaccination practices.",
