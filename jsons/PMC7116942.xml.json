Interventions have an uneven record of success and worryingly high rates of food insecurity remain in many parts of Africa and Asia (E.g. Banerjee et al., 2014; Deaton and Lipka, 2015). One of the major responses to limited success has been an increasing demand for demonstrating achievement of results and value for money from food security interventions (Buntaine et al., 2013). Under this growing results-orientated culture there has been more reflection on the conceptual and theoretical foundations of project design, and how and why success or failure occurs.",

This strand is also important because it connects ToC to proactive change through single-, double- and triple-loop learning. Single-loop learning refers to modification or incremental improvement of action strategies without questioning the underlying assumptions and goals. Double-loop learning is the revisiting and reframing of assumptions and goals (Argyris and Sch\u00f6n, 1999). In triple-loop learning, one starts to reconsider underlying values, beliefs and paradigms, because the initial world-view no longer seems to hold (Flood and Romm, 1996; Pahl-Wostl, 2009).",

In contrast, program theory focuses on the responses an intervention generates, or the mechanisms of change triggered by the intervention (Pawson and Tilley, 1997; Blamey and Mackenzie, 2007). These distinctions are important, since most current work on Impact Pathways, and indeed the application of ToC in AR4D, is largely about implementation logic rather than deep reflection on underlying worldviews, assumptions and theories that explain the mechanics that generate the desired change \u2013 in the manner of triple-loop learning.",

First, we conducted a literature review, triangulated via interviews with experienced practitioners and donors in the agricultural and development field to ascertain the current understanding and application of ToC (Section 2). Four major challenges to mainstreaming emerging as themes from the analysis of literature and interviews are described in Section 3. We then present a case study of the evolution of ToC practice in an AR4D project in West Africa, which exemplifies several of these challenges (Section 4). We conclude with some recommendations about how ToC can be mainstreamed into AR4D, and its practice refined and improved through ongoing testing, reflection and learning.",

At the descriptive end of the continuum, ToC is understood as a precise planning tool that extends the \u201cassumptions\u201d box in a logframe (Green, 2012). In the centre of the continuum the explanatory category provides a response to the causal questions of how and why an intervention works, although such explanations often tend to remain technical. The reflective end of the continuum goes deeper and considers that in addition to having technical dimensions, the enabling environment is also critical as development problems have social, institutional and political dimensions which make problems complex. This ToC interpretation promotes complexity-aware and deliberate reflection to identify and challenge paradigms, theories and assumptions on how change will happen through the interplay between an intervention's design and its context.",

While this is an important development in theory-informed ToC, a generic ToC underpinned by behavioural change theory is unlikely to be appropriate if the primary mechanism for impact is structural change (e.g. institutions, networks and/or infrastructure) rather than individuals' behaviours and choices. There are many cases where structural change has to precede, or at least must be implemented in parallel with, behavioural change among beneficiaries to achieve desired sustainable development impacts (e.g. Butler et al., 2016; Hounkonnou et al., 2012). In West Africa, Hounkonnou et al. (2016, this special issue) clearly demonstrate that institutional changes at levels higher than the farm were a necessary precondition for smallholder agricultural development. Furthermore, more than one theory might be entertained (Funnell and Rogers, 2011). Stakeholders may have alternative or rival theories on how the intervention would trigger behavioural and/or structural change to achieve impact (Rogers and UNICEF, 2014), and there may also be theories that address different aspects of a single intervention.",

Assumptions are also presuppositions or approximations we make about something when we know little about it (Kristr\u00f6m, 1990). In contrast, theories are systematic explanations of observations that relate to a particular aspect of nature (Babbie, 2015). Theories possess explanatory and predictive power and use few assumptions as premises or preconditions to generate an integrated set of testable hypotheses. Theories do not generally make assumptions in their conventional meaning (i.e. as statements accepted as true); instead, key assumptions are either supported by evidence (such as from testing of previously existing theories in certain contexts), or the evidence will be produced in the course of testing the theory in other contexts (Nkwake, 2013). The set of assumptions in a theory must have internal logical consistency, and to be consistent they must be explicit. The process of identifying and questioning key assumptions is crucial for achieving common understanding among stakeholders about how an intervention will generate impact. If conflicting assumptions are not discussed upfront and resolved, they can lead to conflicting expectations from an intervention (Weiss, 2000).",

Strengths include that it a forces project stakeholders to think carefully and systematically through what they are planning to do (Cracknell, 1989); it provides a hierarchical relationship between essential elements of a project, as well as a framework for monitoring and evaluation which can compare planned with actual results; and it provides a simple summary of the key elements of a project proposal in a consistent and coherent way (Bakewell and Garbutt, 2005). The primary weakness of the logframe is that it oversimplifies the reality of intervention\u2013outcome/impact relationships, particularly when dealing with complex development issues in which interacting feedback loops may generate unintended effects (Dale, 2003; Hummelbrunner, 2010). Thus logframes can instil a mistaken belief in predictability and control over how events will unfold during a project (Reeler, 2007), and fail to deal well with the slow or negative progress typical of the early stages of many types of projects (Bakewell and Garbutt, 2005; Hummelbrunner, 2010; Woolcock, 2009).",

Incentive and reward structures based on visible and immediate outputs and outcomes will discourage, even disadvantage, those employing complexity-aware ways of designing and implementing ToC for complex problems. There is a critical need for donors and agencies to provide incentives for the development of the new skill sets in ToC fit for specific combinations of problems, opportunities and contexts among staff who facilitate the design, implementation and on-going evaluation of interventions. Such skills are likely to include inter- or trans-disciplinary approaches, partnership brokering, and multi-loop learning tools (Butler et al., 2017).",

The mismatch between the specificity of assumptions and impact expectations was significant. It was clear that the project team had created the logframe as a top-down process because it was a donor requirement; saw the logframe as a checklist of activities, rather than as a tool to reflect upon and encapsulate a pathway to impact or ToC; and had little conception of a ToC other than as a purely additive structure (i.e. if the listed activities had been conducted and all the assumptions met, then impact would follow).

The team agreed that innovation and adoption of new technologies and practices by producers could only come about through participatory engagement of marketplace actors with producers. As an example, the team developed a causal model for the production and supply of fresh milk (rather than imported powdered milk) to local tourist hotels \u2013 including the identification of intermediate outcomes across different actors/sectors which lead to the ultimate outcome of increased profitability and well-being for households (Fig. 2\n).

Had this exercise been developed further before the project closed in 2014, the team could have progressed further along the continuum, using the causal-model thinking as a foundation. However, several factors impeded this evolution. First, the agronomists and animal scientists who dominated the team were unwilling to use their combined years of field experience with producers and marketplace actors to consider social and institutional factors driving human behaviour, and instead determined that only social scientists were capable of doing so. Nonetheless, their learning did begin the establishment of a community of practice within APESS. The second factor was the amount of time required to allow the learning of the team to evolve from single- to double-loop learning, and with it a deeper explanatory ToC approach. In the event, four years were insufficient to enable this evolution to occur. The third factor was the lack of commitment and resources provided by the donor to encourage such an evolution. In fact, the development of the causal model by the project team was the result of pressure from the donor to demonstrate how impact would arise, rather than any interest in using a ToC to augment the prescribed logframe.",

The reasons for varying stakeholder perceptions may include a desire to advance a particular pathway or a specific technology, or a donor's desire to see tangible results in a hurry. Several authors have reported the unsatisfactory outcome of problem oversimplification (Hummelbrunner, 2010; Ramalingam, 2013). Results-based approaches that instil unrealistic certainty of outcomes encourage aid recipients to neglect hard and complex problems that may not show immediate and visible outcomes (Reeler, 2007). Even in organisations with extensive experience of AR4D, attempts to apply reflective ToC to complex problems with long time horizons have been met with misunderstanding and apprehension (Douthwaite and Hoffecker, 2017). In chaotic emergency situations decisive and rapid top down responses may be imperative in the short term to stabilise an unmanageable situation. However, there is a danger that responses in such circumstances often persist, even when the challenge has changed to a complex or complicated system which requires a different approach (Adams, 2017; Snowden and Boone, 2007).",

A significant commitment is also required to create an environment that encourages critical reflection and different levels of individual and social learning. Such commitment is crucial when developing ToC as part of the design of interventions as probes into complex problems, given that solutions are not likely to be obvious from the outset, and flexible adaptation will be required throughout the intervention. Well-executed and effective mainstreaming of ToC cannot be expected to happen at once. As shown in the case study, it may require a gradual learning process for practitioners, researchers and donors alike.",

It is also essential that systemic learning from practice occurs to build up a repertoire of ToC experience and capability.
