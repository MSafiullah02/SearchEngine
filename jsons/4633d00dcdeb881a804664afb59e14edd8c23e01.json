The incidence was 91.2% and 88.9% respectively. Comparing the 12-29 month old rats. Haps had significantly more severe renal disease while CD rats had a greater proportion of minimally affected kidneys. This difference disappeared when the 30-38 month old CDs were included. POLYARTERITIS NODOSA (PAN). The onset of this condition was age related since it did not occur before 18 months in Hap rats and 24 months in CD rats. For comparable age groups. Haps had a significantly higher incidence of PAN. However, the prevalence was close to 50% (20 to 45) in 30-38 month old CD rats, more than twice that in 24-29 month old CDs. For both stocks the most commonly affected organs were testis, spleen, mesentery, pancreas, and tongue, but vessels in many other organs also were involved. Lesions ranged from acute to chronic and were typical of PAN [4] . The incidence of PAN (23.9% and 23.6% respectively of all the CD and Hap rats examined) was lower than that reported by Berg [7] for SD rats up to 30 months old (60%) and was comparable to that of other SD rats [68] and of several inbred strains [12] . Arterial lesions of identical histological appearance but not acknowledged as PAN were described in 33-34 month old conventional SD virgin males [65] . An early onset of PAN in breeder CD rats analogous to that reported [64] in Sch:Sprague-Dawley'\"' (SD) did not occur. Indeed, the onset was later than in the virgin Haps. Chronic myocarditis occurred in 85.9% of CD rats and in 73.2% of Hap rats and was more prevalent with increasing age. The myocardial changes were identical to those reported by Fairweather [22] and included some or all of the following: myofiber degeneration, atrophy, fibrosis, and mononuclear infiltrates. In 6-11 month old Hap rats, the prevalence was 30.8%, similar to that of F344 rats [19] . Most published reports indicate that the age of onset of chronic myocarditis in rats is 13 months and older [22] . Clinical signs or lesions related to cardiac insufficiency were not present in either SD stock. RADICULONEUROPATHY. In agreement with Burek [12] , early and advanced lesions were found most consistently in the nerve roots comprising the cauda equina, especially in the lumbar vertebrae. In all affected rats, histologic lesions were identical to those described by other investigators [7; 8; 30] . Compared with younger Hap age groups, the prevalence of radiculoneuropathy was elevated markedly in rats older than 17 months. Nine of 11 Hap rats of the 18-23 month old group had histologic evidence of radiculoneuropathy, and all 34 of the 24-29 month old animals were affected. In the CDs, the only animals examined for radiculoneuropathy were those 30-38 months old, and 90.9% were affected. In both stocks, clinical signs of posterior paresis or paralysis were considered to be related to the degenerative CNS lesions. Bilateral hind limb paresis or paralysis was present in all of the 30-38 month old CD rats and in 50% of the 24-29 month old Haps but not in the younger Hap age groups. Rats with paralysis often exhibited urinary incontinence and constipation. Affected animals in the younger age groups had the histologic changes without clinical signs. SKELETAL MUSCLE DEGENERATION AND ATROPHY. Gross and histologic evidence of skeletal muscle damage in the hind limbs most often follows the onset of radiculoneuropathy and is generally considered to be of neurogenic origin [14; 60]. Skeletal muscle degeneration and atrophy were not seen in 6-23 month old Hap or 12-23 month old CD rats. In Hap animals, sarcolemmal proliferation occurred independently of myofiber degeneration in 9.1 % and 30% respectively of the rats in the 12-17 and 18-23 month old groups. The significantly lower incidence of skeletal muscle degeneration in 12-29 month old CD rats suggests that radiculoneuropathy was not as extensive in this stock until the rats reached senescence.",

Smaller, inactive-looking peribronchial and perivascular lymphocytic aggregates unassociated with the pulmonary lesions occurred in all ages of rats. Such bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) is a normal finding in rat lungs [29; 59] . Alveolar histiocytosis had a higher incidence in 12-29 month old Haps but was present in all age groups.

Large collections of histiocytes were recognizable grossly as subpleural white plaques. An age-related incidence was not as clear in either of our stocks as it was in SD rats of Flodh, et al.

The SD rats we have reported on here were outbred. They consisted of retired breeder and virgin groups. Other variables were the location of the colonies, cage size, group size, diet, handling, husbandry, lighting and air changes.
