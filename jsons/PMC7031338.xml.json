Another important component is the use of an efficacious and safe oral rabies vaccine. While oral rabies vaccination campaigns using either attenuated or recombinant vaccines have been successful in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and coyotes (Canis latrans) in North America8\u201310 and in red foxes and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in Europe3,11, there seems to be inefficient or variable efficacy of oral immunisation in some other target species12. In fact, there is limited success in the oral vaccination of raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) as shown experimentally13\u201316 and in field applications17. While relatively low minimum effective vaccine virus titres (<108.0 focus forming units (FFU)/mL) are needed for responsive species including foxes, raccoon dogs and mongooses (Herpestes auropunctatus)18\u201323, skunks and raccoons seem to be rather refractory to oral rabies vaccination, even when high virus titres were administered13,16,24\u201328. Also relatively high doses were needed to successfully immunise dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) by the oral route14,29\u201333.",

However, data are still sparse and the results obtained from the few experimental studies are contradictory. In foxes and dogs for example, the t. palatina was shown to be infected by attenuated rabies vaccine viruses36\u201338. However, these observations were contradicted by another study in which rabies vaccine virus could not be detected in the t. palatina of small Indian mongoose39. Also in the striped skunk, vaccine virus was less frequently detected after oral administration than in red foxes during a comparative study36. The latter findings suggested less efficient uptake or infection by vaccine virus in the t. palatina leading to insufficient immunity to rabies in this reservoir species16,26\u201328,40\u201342.",

Therefore, in this study our primary objective was to elucidate the detailed time course of vaccine virus infection in the t. palatina of the most important rabies reservoir species, e.g. red foxes, raccoon dogs, mongooses, raccoons, dogs and skunks, after oral application by conducting comparative experimental in vivo tracking studies. To this end, we used a highly attenuated and high titred GFP-labelled vaccine virus construct, followed by confocal laser-scan microscopy to visualize and assess differences between various important reservoir species. Prior to this full comparative study, we performed a pilot study to confirm that the results obtained with an attenuated vaccine virus strain36 were reliable using the genetically modified virus. Another objective was to answer the question whether tissues of the oropharyngeal tract other than the t. palatina are also involved in mediating immunity after oral vaccination by detecting the presence of viral RNA and viable virus using highly sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques. To this end, we analysed the anatomical and histological structure of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and Waldeyer\u2019s ring to detect whether differences observed could have an impact on vaccine uptake efficiency.",

Virus detection by RT-qPCR was generally highest in oral swabs taken immediately after direct vaccine virus administration (Table 2). While except for skunks, almost all samples taken 2 hrs pi were positive for viral RNA, after 4 hrs virus detection decreased. At this time point, only oral swab samples of foxes, raccoons and dogs were still virus RNA positive, whereas the positivity rate in raccoon dogs, mongooses and skunks ranged between 30% and 70%. Sporadically, viral RNA could be detected in individuals of several species up to day 4 pi (Table 2). On the opposite, viable virus could only be found up to 4 hrs pi. Notably, virus could only be isolated from three oral swabs from skunks and no viable virus was detected in any of the oral swabs from dogs, whereas all other species had at least 12 oral swabs each during the first 4 hours with positive results (Table 2). Interestingly, almost all saliva specimen of raccoons within the first 4 hrs were positive for viable virus.

By coincidence, the red fox, the initial species for the development of the concept of oral rabies vaccination, was also the species that was highly susceptible to oral rabies vaccination; a relative low minimum effective dose was needed to elicit a protective immune response19\u201321,46. It was only by experience from experimental and field data that other reservoir species required much higher doses to be successfully immunised by the oral route. Principally, due to the instability of the rabies virus, the gastro-intestinal tract will cause rapid antigen degradation, and hence the rabies virus vaccine must be taken up in the oral cavity for the development of an immune response34. However, from some of these early studies in foxes, it became clear that orally administered inactivated rabies virus vaccines did not induce protective immunity47,48, indicating that vaccine virus replication within the host was essential. Hence, presently all available oral rabies vaccines are live replication-competent virus constructs. Based on our previous findings36, this study aimed at elucidating the species-specific uptake, distribution and kinetics of oral rabies vaccines in the oral cavity of the most important terrestrial rabies reservoir species in order to identify barriers for immunisation with a focus on species known to be rather refractory to oral vaccination. To this end, in this first comparative and comprehensive in vivo tracking study with a standardised approach, we used a genetically modified vaccine virus construct, followed by up-to date techniques in imaging and viral RNA detection. Earlier studies could identify infected cells36,37. In this study, using the SAD L16 GFP construct we were also able to identify cells in which active virus gene expression took place.",

Viral N-protein staining confirmed locally restricted areas of RABV infected cells in the peripheral layer of the t. palatina of foxes, raccoon dogs and mongooses with similar limited vertical and lateral spread of virus infection, but failed to identify even single infected cells in the other species (Fig. 2, Table 1). These observations were corroborated by the differences in the detection of infectious virus and relative viral load in the t. palatina of the respective target species (Figs. 4 and 5). The reasons for these obvious differences remain elusive. As discussed before36, the morphology of the lymphoreticular tissue of the pharynx cannot explain the observed differences in vaccine uptake among the species studied here. All species had a comparable anatomic configuration of Waldeyer\u2019s tonsillar ring with a dominating t. palatina. Also histologically, there was no difference in the cellular structure of the tonsils, which were represented by a peripheral non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelial cell layer followed by germinal centres consisting of lymphocytes (see Supplementary Fig. S3).",

This could be the reason why all animals regardless of species exhibited RABV specific antibodies by day 10 pi (Table 3) as measured by the standard RFFIT53 and the more sensitive ELISA53,54, irrespective of the identification of infected cells in the t. palatina. Therefore, other tissues in the oropharyngeal cavity must have been involved in virus uptake and subsequent interaction with the immune system. Screening for viral RNA demonstrated its presence in all investigated tissues, albeit with significant differences in the positivity rates (Fig. 5). The positivity rate for tonsils was higher for species known to be more responsive to oral vaccination as was the relative viral load (Fig. 5) corroborating findings of the immunofluorescence analyses (Figs. 1b and 2). Besides the t. palatina, significantly increased virus detection by RT-qPCR were also seen in mucosa and tongue samples of more responsive species (Fig. 5b), suggesting that infection of other oropharyngeal tissues also contributes to vaccine efficacy. However, based on our data there seems to be no preferential site for vaccine virus uptake and replication in low-responsive species. Our quantitative serological results suggest a correlation with responsiveness to oral vaccination in various species for RFFIT, whereby mean VNA titres of responsive species were significantly higher (p < 0.05) as opposed to low responsive species (Table 3). Even taking this limited number of animals into account this corroborates previous findings53.",

In our study, vaccine virus could only be re-isolated from oral swabs within 4 hours except for dogs where only RNA was present (Table 2). The detection of vaccine RNA in this time window points to a degradation of input virus by the environment in the oral cavity. Occasional detection of vaccine virus RNA in oral tissues beyond day 1 pi (see Supplementary Tables S4\u2013S9) may be due to release of non-infectious virus particles from infected cells or the detection of dislodged cells containing vaccine virus RNA.",

The mechanism behind this could be related to the activation of NF\u03baB related genes, which might lead to a rapid clearance at the primary sites of infection as shown for SPBN GASGAS59. Still quite unknown is whether RABV infection of related immune cells, which could trigger a strong antigen specific response, influences the development of a protective immunity. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that rabies virus could directly infect immune cells. RABV infection of human and mouse T lymphocytes induced apoptosis, which subsequently lead to an enhanced immune response by activating macrophages, cytokine cascades and increased antigen presentation60. Also, RABV was shown to infect and activate primary B cells, which subsequently directly primed and activated CD4+ T cells in vitro61. To investigate whether B and T cell infection occur in vivo, further functional characterisation of target cells, such as lymphocytes in the epithelial cell layers of infected tonsils, is required.",
