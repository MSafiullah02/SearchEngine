Immune activation is an effective as well as protective approach against emerging infectious diseases [1]. Although immune system possesses a wide array of microbial detection and host defense mechanisms, pathogen evasion of the immune surveillance and destruction is a frequent occurrence. This escape of immune surveillance is also an important characteristic of several malignancies [2].",

            "text": "The fundamental role of innate immunity in host defense is becoming clearer as analysis of the human genome continues to identify new genes serving innate immune function. The innate immune system detects the pathogens or the nonself intruders using specific receptors and responds immediately by activation of the immune competent cells, synthesis of cytokines and chemokines, and release of inflammatory mediators to eliminate or contain the intruders. Innate immune activation also triggers and paves the way for adaptive immune response by antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes. The natural killer (NK) cells play a decisive role in the innate immune defense against virus-infected and malignant cells by virtue of their ability to recognize and destroy abnormal cells [3], [4]. Cytokines play crucial roles in regulating various aspects of immune responses. Among cytokines, interleukin (IL)-12 plays a central role in coordinating innate and cell-mediated adaptive immunity [5]. Immune stimulation can provide both prophylactic as well as postexposure protection [6], [7]. Usually, these protective measures are correlated with synthesis of IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, the cytokines of Th1 pathway of T cell differentiation associated with the adaptive immune system [8]. Several compounds that activate immune system such as microbial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), double-stranded RNA and DNA oligonucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs, have been reported earlier [1], [9]. Stimulation of multiple receptors is reported to exhibit synergistic effect in cytokine production [10]. Complement activation cascade is another integral part of the immune system in which the cellular pathogens like intracellular bacteria are coated with complement components (opsonization) and readily undergo phagocytosis. Thus, complement activation plays an important role in microbial killing and is essential for transport and clearance of immune complexes.",

Stimulation by particulate \u03b2-glucans can also enhance the ability of macrophages to recognize and clear apoptotic cells through upregulation of the polysaccharide receptors [13]. Specific \u03b2-glucan receptors have been reported on various immune cells including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, NK cells as well as nonimmune cells including endothelial cells, alveolar cells and fibroblasts [12]. \u03b2-Glucans induce proinflammatory and antimicrobial responses such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-12 synthesis, required for IFN-\u03b3 production and polarization of T helper cells to Th1 pathway [14]. \u03b2-Glucans have also been found to synergize with monoclonal antibodies to suppress and/or eradicate tumors [15], [16]. Yeast \u03b2-glucan has already been demonstrated to have significant degree of protection against anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) infection in a mouse model [17]. Furthermore, exogenous IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 are reported to modulate host's innate immune response in human macrophages, for improving the cell viability and reducing the number of germinated intracellular spores of anthrax [18].",

            "text": "The immunomodulatory effects of \u03b2-glucans are influenced by the molecular mass, chain length, degree of branching, tertiary structure and solubility of the polymer. Although no consensus could be made on the structure\u2013activity relationship [19], the (1\u21923)-\u03b2-glycosidic linkage has been described as an explicit requirement for biological activity [20]. However, Bao et al. [21] recently reported the isolation, characterization as well as in vitro and in vivo lymphocyte proliferation and antibody production by a branched (1\u21923)-\u03b1-d-glucan. Water solubility and lower degree of branching were found to be desirable requirements for biological activity based on the immunological properties of its derivatives. This observation along with the immunological properties of \u03b1-(2\u21928) linked sialic acid as well as that of heteropolysaccharides having \u03b1 conformations in the main chain [22], [23] dispute the explicit requirement of (1\u21923)-\u03b2-glycosidic linkage for the biological activity. In this paper, we describe a novel polysaccharide (RR1), an \u03b1-glucan, exhibiting unique immune boosting properties. RR1 is isolated from a medicinal herb, Tinospora cordifolia (family Minispermaceae), well known in the Indian Ayurvedic System of Medicine for anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, antiarthritic, antioxidant and immune stimulating properties [24], [25], [26], [27], [28].",

The initial analysis of the final product in our laboratory and the 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra revealed that it is a polysaccharide. Therefore, detailed polysaccharide analyses such as the glycosyl composition, linkage, molecular weight and conformation of the glucose units at the anomeric center were performed at the Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia, Athens, GA. The glycosyl composition analysis was done by the combined Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) of the per-O-trimethylsilyl derivatives of the monosaccharide methyl glucosides obtained from RR1 by acidic methanolysis according to the method of York et al. [29]. Inositol was used as internal standard in this analysis. The monosaccharide derivatives were identified by their characteristic retention time and further authenticated with their mass spectra. To perform glycosyl linkage analysis, the sample was permethylated thrice by the method of Ciucanu and Kerek [30], hydrolyzed with 2 M trifluoroacetic acid, reduced with NaBD4 and acetylated with acetic anhydride/pyridine and the resulted partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAA) were analyzed by GC/MS. The sugar residues were identified by their characteristic retention times and mass spectral data. The conformations at the anomeric center of the glucopyranosyl units were obtained based on the 500-MHz proton NMR spectra recorded in D2O and by comparison with the anomeric proton signals of standard samples. The molecular mass was obtained from the size exclusion chromatography using Supelco silica column (1.0\u00d730 cm), eluting with 50 mM ammonium formate buffer at a rate of 0.5 ml/min and detected by the refractive index. Dextran samples were used as standards and the molecular mass was obtained by comparing the retention time of the eluted peak with the standards.",

The glycosyl composition analysis showed glucose as the only component in RR1 while linkage analysis revealed three types of glucopyranosyl residues corresponding to three types of linkages: 4-linked glucopyranosyl residue (80%), 4,6-linked glucopyranosyl residue (12%) and terminal glucopyranosyl residue (8%). The 13C NMR spectra (Fig. 2a) showed well-resolved signals for the carbon atoms in the glucopyranosyl moieties\u2014C1 (\u03b4 99.97 ppm), C2 (\u03b4 73.68 ppm), C3 (\u03b4 71.89 ppm), C4 (\u03b4 77.09 ppm), C5 (\u03b4 71.52 ppm) and C6 (\u03b4 60.83 ppm). The downfield shifts in the C1 and C4 signals confirm the (1\u21924) linkage while the signal at \u03b4 69.57 ppm may be due to the C6 of the (1\u21926) linkage. The signals at \u03b4 5.44 ppm (not well resolved) and that at \u03b4 5.00 ppm in the 500-MHz proton NMR spectra (Fig. 2b) are due to the \u03b1 proton associated with the anomeric carbon of the glucopyranosyl units. On the other hand, the very weak signal at \u03b4 4.66 ppm may be due to that of the \u03b2 anomer. However, the ratio of the signals of \u03b1-d-glucose to \u03b2-d-glucose is about 99.9:1, and hence almost all glucose units appeared to be in the \u03b1 configuration. Therefore, RR1 is an \u03b1-d-glucan with (1\u21924) linked glucopyranosyl units in the main chain with (1\u21926) linked glucopyranosyl unit branches and a 0.15 degree of branching (Fig. 3\n). In the size exclusion chromatography RR1 eluted as single peak at 12.32 min which was very close to the peak for the 511-kDa dextran sample (retention time 12.72 min).

They bind to specific receptors of target cells triggering signal transduction pathways that ultimately lead to gene expression in target cells. Cytokines regulate the intensity and duration of immune responses by stimulating or inhibiting activation, proliferation and/or differentiation of various cells and by regulating the secretion of antibodies or other cytokines.

The production of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 in RR1-treated lymphocytes is consistent with that in the LPS stimulated human monocyte cell lines (THP-1) [35]. IL-12 p70 is the bioactive isoform of IL-12 and is an important factor in the differentiation of na\u00efve T cells into effecter T helper type 1 (Th1) CD4+ lymphocytes secreting IFN-\u03b3 [36]. Besides, it is also reported to have stimulatory effects on NK cells [2]. Recently, IL-12 p70 has emerged as an efficient and minimally toxic antitumor cytokine due to its ability to elicit the Th1 response [37]. Beyond the immune system, this cytokine is also reported to have the capacity to inhibit UV-induced apoptosis and initiation of DNA repair in UV-damaged keratinocytes which ultimately protect the cells from malignancy [38]. IL-12 p40, the homodimeric isoform, is a receptor antagonist of the bioactive heterodimeric isoform p70 in mouse [39]. In the RR1-treated cells, IL-12 p40, the regulatory cytokine is produced in many-fold excess to the bioactive form which may be natural mechanism to control the over production of the bioactive form p70. IL-18 is another potent inducer of IFN-\u03b3 and apparently NK cells [40]. RR1 induction of IL-18 production may be an early response in the development of Th1 response acting in consonance with IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3.",

Furthermore, it is reported to exhibit antitumor effects by enhancing tumor specific immunity, presumably in a T-cell-dependent manner [42]. Our observations indicate that RR1 induces the production of this cytokine significantly at 10 \u03bcg/ml. The significant synthesis of TNF-\u03b1 by RR1 stimulation can play a critical role in host resistance to infections and to the growth of malignancy. TNF-\u03b1 and its receptors are essential for protection against tuberculosis and for NO synthesis in macrophages early in infection [43]. RR1-induced IFN-\u03b3 production may function in part to promote the activity of the components of the cell-mediated immune system such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), macrophages and NK cells in addition to its inhibitory role in Th2 response. It stimulates the bactericidal activity of phagocytic cells and, therefore, boosts the innate immune response [5]. Moreover, it may modulate MCP-1 synthesis in macrophages by LPS [44].",

The distinct pattern of cytokine production by CD4+ cells form a dichotomy, Type 1 (Th1) characterized by IFN-\u03b3 production and promotes elimination of intracellular pathogens and Type 2 (Th2) characterized by IL-4 production, involves IgE and eosinophils suitable for elimination of extra cellular pathogens. Cytokines act directly on T cells during primary activation and appears to be the most direct mediator among the factors influencing the terminal differentiation. The presence of IL-12 leads to Th1 response while IL-4 leads to Th2 development and the two pathways express mutually suppressive effect as well. IL-1 is identified as an inducer of IL-12 [41] while IL-18 is an early response in the development of Th1 cells by induction of IFN-\u03b3. The cytokine profile, IL-12, IL-18, IFN-\u03b3 together with IL-1 by RR1 stimulation and the dose-dependent synthesis of these cytokines clearly demonstrate the Th1 pathway which is essential for cellular immunity and killing of intracellular pathogens and malignant cells. This observation is in conformity with IL-12 induced IFN-\u03b3-dependent T cell development to Th1 and CD8+ cytotoxic effector cells [45], [46], [47]. Concurrent signaling as well as synergistic action by IL-12 and IL-18 induces prolonged IFN-\u03b3 production and the continuous strong expression of IL-18R mRNA in T cells [46]. The early inflammatory events, such as T cell adhesion to inflammatory sites, were also reported for IL-12 and IL-18 [48]. The higher level of the synthesis of the regulatory isoform IL-12 p40 may be a natural mechanism to contain the excessive production of Th1 response.",

As RR1 stimulation resulted in the synthesis of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 and very little IFN-\u03b1, it is reasonable to assume that IFN-\u03b1 priming may be a necessary step for triggering the production of higher levels of NO by polysaccharides [54].",

RR1 is a branched \u03b1-d-glucan structurally distinct from amylopectin and pullalan as no immune stimulation is reported by either amylopectin or pullalan. The similarity of its structure to the conserved molecular pattern of the cell wall components of fungal \u03b2-glucans may be the reason for the activation of immune system. On the other hand, the differences, the \u03b1 conformation and the (1\u21924) linkages, may account for the non-induction of iNOS [49] and the consequent noncytotoxicity and the absence of oxidative stress. This water soluble neutral \u03b1-glucan has molecular mass and branching sequence well within the range of the polysaccharides exhibiting significant immune stimulating properties [11], [12], [19], [21]. The water solubility can overcome the granuloma formations exhibited by particulate \u03b2-glucans while the high molecular mass, being in the most potent range, may enable it to be retained by the host's organs for longer period without degradation [60], [61]. While the noncytotoxic nature, the significant activation of the lymphocytes, especially the NK cells and the alternate pathway of complement activation demonstrate the stimulation of the innate immune system, the cytokine profile resulting from the activation proclaims the stimulation of the antigen specific cell mediated (adaptive) immunity (Th1 pathway) with a self-regulating mechanism of its overrun. The absence of IL-4 synthesis (Th1 suppressor cytokine) and IL-10 (the inhibitor of IL-12) on stimulation with RR1 is in good agreement with the Th1 pathway of T cell differentiation. The IFN-\u03b3 production by the concurrent signaling of IL-12 and IL-18 may serve as a potent anti anthrax agent, devoid of side effects, if any, of the exogenous IFN treatment as well. A stimulated innate immune system can fight the entry of any pathogens into the host and has the capacity to prevent primary infections from actually causing disease [62]. The unique immune stimulating properties of RR1 without exerting oxidative stress and any direct cytotoxic effect, thus far described, may make it a potent biodefense agent against a number of pathogens and human malignancies.",
