Despite adverse political events nationally and internationally, tourism in Fiji has grown over the last years (Fig. 1\n) and is forecast to grow at an average rate of 6.2% per year between 2004 and 2014 (Campbell, 2004). In 2002, most tourists came from Australia (31%), New Zealand (17%), the United States (15%) and the United Kingdom (11%). While most visitors come for \u2018rest and relaxation\u2019 typically linked to beach environments (Ministry of Tourism, 2003), current marketing campaigns aim to shift the image away from pure beach promotion to a wider experience. Also, there are attempts to attract more tourists from long-haul markets, for example from the USA and Europe, in addition to the traditional markets of Australia and New Zealand (Ayala, 1995; S. Toganivalu, Manager, Fiji Visitors Bureau, pers. comm.).",

In 1998, tourism earned F$568 million in foreign exchange, while sugar only earned F$244 million (Narayan, 2000). The decline of the sugar industry (Narayan and Prasad, 2003) has resulted in heightened expectations from tourism as the main export industry (Levett and McNally, 2003). In 1999, tourism directly and indirectly contributed 29.5% to GDP and 37.0% to exports (Word Travel and Tourism Council, 2001). A major problem of tourism in Fiji, however, is its economic leakage; about 60% of tourists\u2019 expenditure is estimated to leak out of the country (Levett and McNally, 2003).",

The Fiji Tourism Development Plan 1998\u20132005 (Ministry of Tourism, 1998) recommended a \u2018Step Change\u2019, with a substantial number of new developments, mainly in the already developed areas of the Coral Coast and the Mamanuca Islands. Levett and McNally (2003) assessed the sustainability of this Tourism Development Plan and concluded that it contains some useful suggestions for reducing tourism's environmental impacts. However, the authors expressed concern that the large scale of the envisaged development could exceed carrying capacities and \u2018tip the balance\u2019 towards irreversible effects on the environment. While there exist policy frameworks that regulate tourism development (e.g., Environmental Impact Assessment), few of them are implemented and work in practice.",

However, in contrast to atoll islands (e.g., the Maldives or Kiribas), the higher Fiji islands such as Viti Levu offer some room to shift activities inland under a long-term scenario of sea level rise. Climate-related risks in coastal areas pose a risk for existing capital and could also be a major impediment to further investment and capital, in particular when insurance premiums are high or exclude cover for damage resulting from climate-related impacts.

Low-lying atolls could be completely lost as a result of sea level rise. In addition, major damage to existing coastal ecosystems is expected as a result of climate change (World Bank, 2000). Coastal ecosystems are already under pressure from overexploitation, pollution (from sewage, toxic substances, and nutrients), deforestation, infrastructure development, loss of mangroves,1\nconversion into agricultural land, and coral mining (Feresi et al., 2000).

Reefs have several functions: they are important for biodiversity, provide habitat for fish, buffer against waves and erosion, and provide carbonate sand for beaches (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2000). The optimal ambient temperature for coral is 25\u201329 \u00b0C and they are extremely sensitive to sudden changes in their environment. When corals are under stress, they expel the algae (dinoflagellates) that symbiotically supply them with oxygen or food, resulting in \u2018bleaching\u2019. Corals are already under stress from factors such as high nutrient content, turbidity and sedimentation, overfishing, destructive fishing methods, changed water chemistry and physical damage, and an increase in sea level. Some corals can grow at the same rate upwards as sea levels rise; however, these types of corals are not common in the Pacific, where existing coral species are characterised by lateral rather than vertical growth (Nunn, 2000). An ecological shift in coral composition would be required in the Pacific to compensate for rising sea levels. Stress thresholds that result in bleaching events will become very frequent in islands of the South Pacific between 2010 and 2070, and it is likely that in the next 20\u201350 years corals as dominant organisms on reefs will disappear (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2000). Destruction of a substantial proportion of the coral reefs means that one of the major pull factors for tourists to Fiji could disappear (see also Cesar et al., 2003).",

Unfortunately, the responses do not represent the true geographical dispersion of tourism.

This may be related to a possibly greater environmental awareness and involvement of these businesses as reflected in the existence of the Mamanuca Environment Society with 11 islands and 28 members. Overall, it is possible that the accommodation survey is biased towards businesses that are more interested in and aware of climate change, which may have aided their willingness to reply. Because of its small sample size, the accommodation survey has to be seen as indicative rather than truly representative.

Carbon dioxide emissions associated with electricity provided in Viti Levu through the main grid had to be estimated based on the information that about 24.5% of electricity is based on thermal generation, with the remainder being either hydropower or generated by burning bagasse from sugarcane, both of which were considered carbon neutral. No data were available on the ratio of fossil fuel input to electricity output for Fiji thermal power plants from which emission factors could be calculated. For this reason a New Zealand figure of 624 g of CO2/kWh electricity consumed (i.e., including transmission losses) was used (New Zealand Ministry of Commerce, 1995); in the knowledge that this figure might differ for the Fijian context.

Some resorts use recycled or grey water for irrigation, hold grey water reservoirs for firefighting, and operate toilets with saltwater or recycled water for flushing. There are also technological solutions for water-conserving showers and toilets (e.g., dual flush). A major problem that undermines water conservation measures is leakage. Unknown but potentially substantial quantities of freshwater leak into the sea. More remote islands have the option of a desalination plant, with costs being only slightly higher than shipping water to the island (B. Herriman, Engineer, Beachcomber Island, pers. comm.).

The main reason for this lies in electricity generation, which is much less carbon-intensive in Viti Levu due to the high proportion of renewable energy sources (hydro and bagasse) compared with diesel generation on islands with its inherent inefficiency (about 65\u201370% of energy input is lost during the process of generation). Moreover, resorts on remote islands operate more or less self-sufficiently, and therefore have additional energy requirements (e.g., sewage treatment, freezing rubbish2\n). Transport energy use is also high given that not only do tourists have to be transported to and from the resort, but so also do food supplies, energy (diesel and gas), water and other devices required for operating the resort.",

The total number of visitor nights spent in Fiji was 2,891,295 in 2002 (Ministry of Tourism, 2003), whereby 82% of visitor-nights were spent in hotels, 13% in backpacker/budget accommodation, with the remainder of nights being spent in motels, on boats or in other forms of commercial and non-commercial accommodation. For the purpose of this extrapolation it is assumed that the category \u2018hotel\u2019 in the Ministry of Tourism's IVS is equivalent to \u2018resort\u2019 as shown in Table 5, the backpacker category is the same as budget accommodation, and the remaining categories are aggregated into the motel category. With this breakdown, the total energy use due to tourist accommodation was calculated to be 1,078,373,475 (MJ per annum (or 1078 terajoules (TJ)), which is equivalent to a contribution to national energy use of about 6.5% (Department of Energy, 2003). In terms of CO2, the accommodation industry emits roughly 68,219 t per annum (Department of Environment, no date). Since no recent data are available for national CO2 emissions, the accommodation sector's contribution to these emissions is not calculated, but it would be at least in the same order as the 6.5% derived for energy use.

The operation of diesel generators is costly, because of inefficiencies, transportation costs (diesel shipment), maintenance, and salaries for powerhouse staff. Thus, managers have an economic interest in keeping electricity consumption low. The crux with diesel generators, however, is that once a generator is purchased, the optimum range of electricity generation is determined at about 80% of the maximum performance. If as a result of electricity conservation the generator runs below this range, the diesel is not combusted completely, which ultimately reduces the lifetime of the generator (B. Herriman, pers. comm.). To overcome this problem, one business reported that they switch to a smaller generator at night-time. However, purchasing a smaller generator is often not an alternative because of high capital costs. For these reasons some managers see little incentive in conserving energy below a certain performance of their generator (H. Sykes, Resort Consultant, pers. comm.).",

Wind energy is not widely used in Fiji, but the Coral Coast, Mamanuca Islands, and Sonasavu are promising locations for wind-powered generation (A. Gonelevu, pers. comm.).

Tourist resorts would need small- to medium-scale wind systems if they want to meet their whole electricity demand by wind power. Small islands are unlikely to erect wind turbines because of lack of space and noise pollution (B. Herriman, pers. comm.). Resorts on larger areas are in a better position to pursue wind energy (A.

The vulnerability to extreme climate-related events can be reduced when climate change adaptation is integrated in the development process from the earliest stages (Jones, 2003). The exact location of the development, as well as the design (e.g., building materials, orientation, structures) and landscaping can help reduce vulnerability. There is also some opportunity to harmonise tourism development at locations that are less vulnerable to climate change (e.g., inland areas in Viti Levu) with current attempts of diversifying Fiji's tourism product, especially in relation to \u2018ecotourism\u2019.

Wider environmental problems that need to be considered are pollution, deforestation, and overexploitation of resources. Measures that have the potential to address the above issues in addition to climate change offer no-regret solutions (Hay et al., 2003) and are therefore more likely to be funded (e.g., by donor agencies) and taken up by local agencies, stakeholders, and industry members. Adopting wider environmental management practices, for example, addresses climate change adaptation and mitigation, and also has the potential of providing a \u2018unique selling point\u2019 for Fiji as a sustainable tourist destination. Developing small-scale technologies for solar or wind energy on the more remote islands would also help reduce the dependency on imported fossil fuel and economic leakage.",

            "text": "A good example of combining climate change adaptation and mitigation is reforestation. Trees reduce vulnerability to cyclones, improve microclimates, and enhance landscapes used for tourist activities. Moreover, trees function as carbon sinks, although Dang et al. (2003) note that those species preferred for adaptive measures (e.g., erosion control or watershed management) are not necessarily the ones most suited for carbon sequestration. Beg et al. (2002, p. 139) recommend that forest protection or plantation should be done \u2018under the umbrella of adaptation policies, given the controversial aspects of including it under mitigation options, such as the Clean Development Mechanism\u2019 (p. 139). Notwithstanding this, there is some potential to include forest sinks in carbon trading schemes, whereby carbon emitters (e.g., tourist resorts) purchase carbon credits from landowners who restore forest on (marginal) land (e.g., see EBEX21, www.ebex21.co.nz). In Fiji, such a scheme would need to address land rights issues, which may be difficult to solve in the near future (H. Sykes, pers. comm.). Despite some possible practical difficulties, the option of forest carbon sinks should be explored further, especially when seeking to offset emissions associated with tourists\u2019 travel to and from Fiji (Hart et al., 2004). In 2002, tourists\u2019 international air travel (one-way) to Fiji consumed about 5500 TJ of energy, and this resulted in CO2 emissions of about 384,000 t (for more detail, see Becken, 2004).",

Those operators are also best prepared for increased risks resulting from climate change.

Since the scope and costs for many adaptation and mitigation measures are largely determined by the design of tourist facilities, the incorporation of these aspects into architectural courses is particularly important. Alongside information and education initiatives, the Government could assist businesses in undertaking energy audits, facilitating the implementation of Environmental Management Systems (e.g., Green Globe 21), and providing incentives, for example for the uptake of renewable energy sources.",

A two-level approach could be possible, where guidelines are provided for tourism operators to develop their own risk or disaster management plan at the business level, while Government covers wider issues beyond individual businesses, such as tourism infrastructure and larger evacuation plans. The current attempt by the Fiji Visitor Bureau (S. Tonganivalu, pers. comm.) to diversify the product could be seen as part of national-level risk management, as they attempt to spread risk across different markets (e.g., event tourism, sport tourism, nature tourism) and seasons. Fewer initiatives exist to weather-proof tourism, as suggested for tourism in Phuket, Thailand (Raksakulthai, 2003). Another important step towards implementing a nation-wide risk management strategy for tourism and climate change would be the mapping of all tourism infrastructure, as well as the risk of various hazards in different locations.",

It is recommended that the synergies between adaptation, mitigation, and sustainable development be explored further and that the effects be quantified where possible; i.e., how much carbon can be saved as a result of a particular measure and what costs are involved (Dang et al., 2003).
