Viruses are generally classified according to the type of their nucleic acid, their protein structure, and whether or not they have a lipid-containing envelope surrounding the viral particle. In general, most viruses gain entry into the lungs via the conducting airways. In nonprimate mammalians these infections are most prominent in the cranioventral lung lobes because of their horizontal position.

In many species there are strains of the virus that specifically target the respiratory system including dogs, cats, cattle, horses, and chickens. In these species, the virus can target the upper but also the lower respiratory tract, predisposing the host to secondary bacterial infection through impairment of lung defenses.",

            "text": "Equine multinodular pulmonary fibrosis is caused by the equine herpesvirus 5 (EHV-5), a \u03b3-herpes virus. Infected lungs manifest two distinct gross patterns of disease. A pattern of numerous coalescing nodules that are pale white and moderately firm (Fig. 24.4) is the most common. In some cases, the growth pattern is that of multiple discrete nodules (Fig. 24.5). Histologically, the lungs show severe interstitial fibrosis, accompanied by a mixed inflammatory infiltrate. The majority of the inflammatory cells are lymphocytes, as well as macrophages, neutrophils, and occasionally eosinophils. The alveolar spaces contain moderate numbers of neutrophils and macrophages. Macrophages with eosinophilic cytoplasm and large eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies (Williams et al. 2007) can be seen. Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) may cause vasculitis leading to abortion, stillbirth, encephalomyelopathy, and respiratory disease. Fatal nonneurological EHV-1 infection in young adult horses does occur but is rare. Gross findings in the lung of a nonneurological EHV-1 infection may include severe edema (Fig. 24.6) and hydrothorax. Histological examination usually reveals pulmonary edema and perivascular hemorrhage while the alveolar spaces and the conducting airways may be filled with proteinaceous fluid, fibrin, desquamated epithelial cells, and macrophages (Fig. 24.7). Prominent type II pneumocytes and perivascular infiltration by mononuclear cells can also be seen (Fig. 24.8). Intranuclear eosinophilic Cowdry type A inclusion bodies are rarely noted in endothelial cells. Immunohistochemistry is useful demonstrating the expression of EHV-1 antigen within endothelial cells (Fig. 24.9) (Del Piero et al. 2000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They are pathogenic to various species including cats, cattle, ground squirrels, guinea pigs, horses, mice, monkeys, sheep, and swine. They affect the lung as well as multiple other organs. Rarely, the lung may be the only affected organ (Hoover and Thacker 1979). CMV infections are most often latent, but under appropriate circumstances, they may result in severe and often fatal infections. In monkeys several patterns of lesions with focal, diffuse, and a mixed pattern of disease have been reported. The lungs with the diffuse pattern of disease seen in monkeys (Baskin 1987) and sheep (Hoover and Thacker 1979) are heavy, wet, and consolidated. Microscopically, focal lesions show interstitial thickening and prominent hypertrophic pneumocytes. The alveolar spaces contain proteinaceous exudate with macrophages, neutrophils, and multinucleated giant cells with intranuclear basophilic inclusion bodies (Figs. 24.10 and 24.11) and occasionally necrotic foci. Microscopic changes in the diffuse forms are similar to those seen in the focal pattern but are generally more severe with chronic organizational changes (Baskin 1987). Electron micrographs illustrate virus present within the cell nucleus (Fig. 24.12) and viral budding from membranes (Fig. 24.13).\n\n\n\n\n",

Immunocompetent mice are susceptible. In the initial stage of infection, the virus is only mildly cytopathic. During the immune phase of the disease when cytotoxic T cells destroy the virus-infected cells, there is necrosis of the respiratory epithelium. This is followed by proliferating hyperplastic epithelium and increased perivascular, peribronchial cuffing, and interstitial infiltration by lymphocytes (Fig. 24.16) (Percy and Barthold 2007).\n\n",

Initial manifestations include coughing and exercise intolerance, followed by wheezing, nasal discharge, and crackles. Grossly, white firm consolidated pulmonary nodules are present (Fig. 24.32). Histological examination generally shows papillary and acinar structures lined by columnar to cuboidal cells replacing the alveolar spaces of the lung (Fig. 24.33). Immunohistochemical studies show the presence of surfactant proteins in the majority of affected cells that generally correspond to type II alveolar cells (Platt 2002).

            "text": "Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) is a lentivirus in the family of Retroviridae. Infections secondary to SIV occur spontaneously and asymptomatically in several species of monkeys and macaques, the latter sometimes developing an immunodeficiency syndrome (Baskin et al. 1991). Gross findings in the lungs include diffuse pleural thickening, with some irregular firm foci of consolidation. The lesions seen in early stage of the infection tend to be localized. Microscopically, perivascular infiltration by lymphocytes and histiocytes around small vessels (Fig. 24.38) as well as infiltration of the alveolar septa by mononuclear inflammatory cells (Fig. 24.39) can be seen. Syncytial multinucleated giant cells occur during the stage of rapid multiplication (Fig. 24.40). In advanced infections the lesions are diffuse and/or patchy (Fig. 24.41) and are associated with alveolar spaces filled with exudate that include fibrin, histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils, and syncytial cells (Fig. 24.42). In advanced stages there is mild fibrosis of the alveolar septae and fibrosis of the visceral pleura (Baskin et al. 1991). Mature virions are present in cytoplasmic vacuoles in syncytial cells and macrophages (Fig. 24.43).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
