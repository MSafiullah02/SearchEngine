            "text": "Molecular-based treatment options for cancer patients have historically consisted of antimetabolites (Gemcitabine/Gemzar\u00ae), topoisomerase poisons (CPT11/Camptostar\u00ae), tubulin stabilizers (Paclitaxel/Taxol\u00ae), and, more recently, protein kinase inhibitors (Imatinib/Gleevec\u00ae), with several additional classes undergoing clinical evaluation (e.g., HDAC inhibitors, phosphatase inhibitors, PARP inhibitors). The era of molecular oncology drugs began in 2001 with the FDA approval (for chronic myelogenous leukemia) of Gleevec\u00ae, an inhibitor of the protein kinase Bcr-Abl, and, shortly thereafter, of other protein kinase inhibitors (e.g., Tykerb\u00ae, Tarceva\u00ae, Nexavar\u00ae) for various malignancies. These kinase inhibitors were the first of a new class of antitumor agent (targeted effector) that was developed to deliver efficacy accompanied by a reduced number and severity of side effects, compared with those of traditional toxic chemotherapeutic agents. The attractiveness of this therapeutic strategy resides in the existence of a multitude of kinases, each with an identifiable function critical to cell growth, suggesting that selective pharmacologic action is possible. The new, molecular targeted drugs impact various signaling pathways by post-translational modification\u2014addition (kinases) or removal (phosphatases) of a phosphate group to or from a serine, threonine, or tyrosine of a target protein, resulting most often in activation or deactivation of an enzyme. A parallel, but more complex post translational modification strategy is afforded by the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway, in which the 76-amino acid protein tag ubiquitin is conjugated to (by sequential action of the E1 activating enzyme, E2 conjugating enzyme, and E3 ligase) or deconjugated from \u03b5-amino groups of lysines of specific target proteins. Consequences of ubiquitylation/de-ubiquitylation include changes in cellular half-life (and thus activity) of target proteins, cellular compartmentation, and trafficking between cytosol and nucleus or between the cell membrane and vesicles containing proteases. As in the case of kinases/phosphatases, selective action is possible owing to the large numbers of E3 ligases (several hundreds) and DUBs (approximately eighty). However, in contrast to phosphorylation, the ubiquitin pathway includes additional levels of complexity. Firstly, a single ubiquitin may be conjugated to a target protein or to a ubiquitin already conjugated to a protein, resulting in poly-ubiquitin chains. Moreover, the poly-ubiquitin chain linkage may be linear or branched, and may involve one of several lysines contained in the ubiquitin molecule (e.g., K63, K48, K11). Consequently, the potential for selective binding of a ubiquitin pathway enzyme and/or an enzyme inhibitor to the ubiquitylated target protein must be considered in a more 3-dimensional setting. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway offers a third target class\u2014the proteasome itself, which receives poly-ubiquitylated proteins and degrades them utilizing various proteolytic activities. During the past two decades, these three molecular target classes (two that are relatively selective and one that is nonselective) have been studied and exploited for anticancer drug development. In fact, it was the global target, the proteasome, not the target-selective DUBs or ligases, which produced the first positive drug discovery results and the first efficacious ubiquitin pathway drug for cancer treatment, bortezomib, in 2003.",

            "text": "The simple consequence of blocking cellular protein degradation in the proteasome is the accumulation of ubiquitylated proteins of all sorts, which appears upon first consideration to be an intolerable consequence for any cell. The proteasome was thought of as the cell's garbage disposal unit, and its blockade assumed to result in a huge excess of unwanted proteins\u2014a toxic event. On the contrary, however, this global response has been harnessed to provide antitumor activity against multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphomas in patients, accompanied by manageable toxicity. In 2003 [1], bortezomib, a dipeptidylboronic acid that binds reversibly to the \u03b25 subunit of the 20S degradation chamber of the proteasome and thereby inhibits it, was approved by the FDA for treatment of relapsed refractory multiple melanoma, following impressive activity in clinical trials [2]. Subsequently, bortezomib was approved for first line treatment of multiple myeloma and for the treatment of relapsed mantle cell lymphoma [3]. This compound had been studied extensively during preclinical and clinical development to elucidate its mechanisms of cytotoxicity and its preference for tumor vs. normal cells (reviewed in [4]). Because of bortezomib's clinical success, mechanism studies of this drug and other proteasome inhibitors have received less attention than the clinical studies, as bortezomib is active in numerous combinations and may have expanded clinical utility. Nevertheless, details of mechanism are emerging. As expected, numerous proteins responsible for apoptosis (e.g. p53) were found to be degraded by the proteasome and it is now clear that inhibition of proteasome activity leads to apoptosis by sparing these proteins. Proteasome inhibitors may also induce apoptosis indirectly by inhibiting NF- \u03baB activation [5], thereby preventing transcription of various anti-apoptotic proteins. In addition, cellular mechanism studies have suggested that bortezomib inhibits angiogenesis, which could contribute to its antitumor activity [6], is efficacious in various combination therapies, and can overcome resistance to traditional cytotoxic therapies [7]. Thus, although bortezomib has a reasonable therapeutic index, it is a pleiotropic cytotoxic drug (producing peripheral neuropathy and other toxicities commonly associated with chemotherapeutic agents). Its therapeutic window is very narrow, as dose-limiting toxicities are evident just above the treatment dose. Moreover, due in part to mutations in the \u03b25 chymotrypsin-like catalytic subunit of the proteasome, resistance to bortezomib is becoming evident [8], [9].",

            "text": "While MLN-9708 and CEP-18770 are both reversible inhibitors like bortezomib, they offer the potential advantage of oral administration, which may improve patient experience even though they may not be superior to bortezomib in therapeutic index or susceptibility to resistance. However, other latter-generation proteasome inhibitors now in clinical trial (Table 1\n) may have improved therapeutic index and in part due to a different mode of binding a diminished tendency to be compromised by resistance as compared with bortezomib [9]. To address these clinical challenges, two proteasome-related strategies have emerged. The first strategy addresses the binding mode. For example, carfilzomib, the next inhibitor scheduled for FDA review, is an irreversible binder to the chymotrypsin-like \u03b25 site, in contrast to bortezomib, which binds reversibly. The epoxyketonecarfilzomib is a more potent inhibitor than bortezomib, contributing to an improved therapeutic index. The second strategy exploits proteasome heterogeneity. In addition to the classical (\u201cconstitutive\u201d) proteasome, which is present in all cells, some cells contain a second proteasome that differs from the constitutive proteasome in the \u03b21, \u03b22, and \u03b25 catalytic subunits (denoted as \u03b21i, \u03b22i, and \u03b25i for the immunoproteasome) and contains an 11S regulatory particle [10]). Because this second proteasome type can be induced by interferon and generates antigenic peptides for the immune response, it is known as the immunoproteasome. The heterogeneity strategy is also exemplified by carfilzomib, which inhibits both constitutive proteasomes and immunoproteasomes and overcomes bortezomib resistance in preclinical models [11]. It is interesting to note that the most potent experimental immunoproteasome inhibitor, IPSI-001, preferentially targets the \u03b21i subunit of the immunoproteasome and, like carfilzomib, overcomes resistance to bortezomib [12]. An orally bioavailable truncated version of carfilzomib, ONX 0192, is in Phase I clinical trial. Another potential means of overcoming resistance to bortezomib lies in the ability of the irreversible Phase I proteasome inhibitor NPI0052 which in contrast to bortezomib inhibits the trypsin-like as well as chymotrypsin-like protease activity [13].",

            "text": "Proteasome inhibitors currently in preclinical development are addressing the issues of therapeutic index (including the need for activity in a broad spectrum of solid tumors) and resistance in various ways. Following up on an observation in the Goldberg laboratory suggesting that allosteric interactions among the proteasome subunits may offer additional therapeutic strategies [14], Kisselev et al. have developed inhibitors that are selective for \u03b21 (caspase-like [15]) or \u03b22 (trypsin-like [16]) subunits and have shown that trypsin site-selective inhibitors can sensitize myeloma cells to chymotrypsin-like site inhibitors such as bortezomib and, in combination with caspase-like site inhibitors, inhibit cell growth in the absence of chymotrypsin-like site inhibitors [16]. Other studies have identified various known small molecules (e.g., chloroquine and more potent substituted chloroquines such as 5AHQ) as allosteric inhibitors with clinical potential (reviewed in [10]) (Table 2\n). It is anticipated that allosteric proteasome inhibitors similar to these will enter clinical trial within the next few years. Another class, represented by clioquinol, may work by binding metals that are essential to the proteasome [10]. Finally, deubiquitylating activity resident in the 19S regulatory portion of the intact proteasome has recently been identified as a novel anticancer target using the small molecule b-AP15, found in a functional screen [17]. This compound selectively inhibited the deubiquitylating activity of the 19S associated DUBs UCH-L5 and USP14, resulting in a blockade of proteasome activity; it thus represents a very early but promising class of proteasome inhibitor.",

The majority of E3 ligases do not possess a classic active site, instead they mediate protein\u2013protein interactions between the charged E2 and the protein substrate. Therefore, perhaps not surprisingly, the most advanced ligase-based drug discovery strategy to date has been the development of antagonists of E3-substrate binding. Attempts to find an antagonist of the E3 ligase MDM2/HDM2 (HDM2 being the human enzyme) were among the earliest of these exercises, as MDM2 seemed to be a perfect anticancer target, being responsible for ubiquitylating the tumor suppressor pro-apoptotic protein p53.",

Inhibition of MDM2 was one of many molecular oncology strategies employed in the last 10\u201315 years to maximize p53 presence and activity in tumors ([28]; reviewed in [25]), and the two E3 ligase antagonists currently in clinical trial for cancer, RO5045337 (nutlin-3) and JNJ-26854165 (Table 3), are directed at MDM2, specifically, at the regulation of its substrate, p53 [23]. Several compounds inhibiting members of a family of E3 ligases known as anti-apoptotic proteins (IAPs) have also recently entered clinical trial [24]. These IAPs ubiquitylate proteins that are essential to apoptosis, eliminating their function and, thus, blocking apoptosis. Analogs of Smac, a naturally occurring protein that binds to the IAP, triggering its auto-ubiquitylation, subsume this function and restore apoptotic activity. It was speculated in an opinion piece published in 2005 [26] that the nutlin compounds might not progress to clinical trial owing to poor animal efficacy and that E3s in general are perhaps too complex for drug discovery. The fact that 7 years later there are two MDM2-p53 binding inhibitors (including a nutlin) and seven IAP antagonists in Phase I/II clinical trial suggests that E3 ligases constitute a viable, if not the most facile drug discovery area.",

A trivial answer may be that the biochemistry of certain malignancies (proteasome inhibitors have not yet demonstrated utility over a broad range of tumor types) makes them hypersensitive to proteasome inhibitor-induced apoptosis, hence a therapeutic window. An interesting alternative explanation is that sparing a large number of proteins from degradation by inhibiting the proteasome ensures that multiple pro-apoptotic, anti-survival activities are allowed to proceed, while blocking a single oncogenic DUB or E3 ligase with an exquisitely selective inhibitor has a limited effect owing to circumvention by functional redundancy or compensation by other enzymes. It is possible that inhibitors of limited, rather than absolute selectivity against DUBs or ligases will exhibit improved efficacy, as in the case of recently approved dual kinase inhibitors [44]. Ongoing work with new inhibitors of the proteasome and of ubiquitin pathway enzymes will help to answer these questions.",
