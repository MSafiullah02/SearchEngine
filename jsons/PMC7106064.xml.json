In 2013, our group and collaborators identified the genetic defect in four patients as being due to a homozygous duplication mutation (c.1292dupG) in exon 13 of IKBKB, the gene encoding inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase subunit beta (IKK\u03b2, also known as IKK2) [1].",

Patients with hypermorphic gain of function mutations in NFKBIA [[10], [11], [12]], resulting in reduced degradation of the I\u03baB\u03b1 protein, have also been shown to exhibit significant combined immune deficiencies. Furthermore, the IKK/NF-\u03baB pathway operates in both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, leading to the extra-immune findings seen in patients with defects in NEMO and I\u03baB\u03b1, such as ectodermal dysplasia and colitis.",

The authors identified all known (genetically confirmed) or highly suspected infants with the IKBKB mutation managed through the Department of Pediatrics, Winnipeg Children's Hospital, CancerCare Manitoba and the Manitoba Blood and Marrow Transplant Program dating to the 1970s. Data collected by retrospective chart review included clinical presentation, immunologic features, and HSCT approaches and outcomes. Although data was complete for patients diagnosed in a contemporary era (after 2000), data availability was variable for some patients before this (1970\u20132000). Young infants of Northern Cree descent from the known affected communities presenting with a clinical picture consistent with a severe immune deficiency but without genetic confirmation of an IKBKB mutation were considered highly suspected if they also had a close familial relationship to a genetically confirmed infant with the mutation (e.g. sibling, or second-degree relative where there was known consanguinity within the family). We chose to report the decade of diagnosis (instead of year) to provide the reader with perspective on the immunologic investigations and treatments available at the time, while protecting against the potential for inadvertently identifying individuals, given that patients and their families reside in small communities. Detailed family trees documenting consanguineous relationships within families have not been included for the same reason.",

We believe that IKBKB immune deficiency, although not meeting conventional laboratory-based diagnostic criteria for SCID [19] (due to higher CD3 T-cell counts, moderately decreased to normal PHA responses, normal TRECs, high proportions of na\u00efve CD45RA+ T-cells, and low CD45RO+ T-cells in IKBKB immune deficiency), is as severe an immune deficiency as SCID at a clinical level. We would suggest therefore, that inclusion of IKBKB deficiency under the descriptive category of \u201ccombined immune deficiencies generally less profound than SCID\u201d in the most recent 2017 International Union Immunologic Societies classification [20], likely underestimates the severity of the immune deficiency and should be modified in future iterations.",

Given the severe clinical phenotype of IKBKB immune deficiency, a pilot project of targeted newborn screening by direct genetic mutation analysis of Guthrie cards for the IKBKB mutation was developed in select Northern Cree communities in Manitoba. This investigation identified a carrier frequency of 1 in 13.1 newborns, with a predicted mutation homozygosity of 1/686 births [24]. Over 5-years (2013\u20132018), 760 newborns from two communities were screened, with one infant identified at birth (patient 15) and a subsequent sibling (patient 16) identified in-utero. Both were placed in protective isolation after birth and received HSCT at an early age, before the onset of serious infections, important variables associated with excellent outcomes in SCID HSCT [25,26]. In other populations with founder mutations or high rates of consanguinity, a similar genetic-based newborn screening strategy such as ours might be applicable.",

This illustrates a complex interplay between what we suspect are ongoing defects in immunity post-HSCT, combined with poor social determinants of health. For familial and cultural reasons, our patients often have strong desires to return home soon after HSCT, and the tertiary care HSCT center is not easily accessible from their remote communities. With the death of patient 15, and with the recent transplant of patient 16, we have instituted a program of housing the family close to the tertiary care center for at least 1.5 years post-HSCT, as well as regular immunoglobulin replacement and indefinite daily anti-pneumococcal antibiotic prophylaxis.",

            "text": "Much remains unknown about the immune abnormalities in patients with IKBKB immune deficiency, both before and after HSCT. From our previous investigations, the broad immune defects relate to abnormal IKK/NF-\u03baB signaling in T-cells, B-cells and innate immune cells, resulting in generalized activation defects to a variety of stimuli [1]. With the exception of regulatory T-cells and gamma-delta T-cells, which are absent in IKBKB immune deficiency, other lymphocyte subsets appear to develop normally. Despite thymic hypoplasia in five of our patients who died either prior to or after HSCT, six other patients had normal TREC levels at the time of diagnosis, suggesting no intrinsic defect in T-cell development and maturation within the thymus. Unfortunately, none of the patients who had autopsies performed had detailed TREC analysis, making direct correlation with the underdevelopment of the thymus and TREC levels in a single patient impossible. Detailed T-cell studies were not available for most of our patients pre-HSCT, but when previously studied in one patient (and in one additional patient in this series), the T-cell receptor beta-chain variable region repertoire was polyclonal [1]. We are unable to resolve this apparent contradiction in the autopsy and immunologic findings, and believe it warrants further study. Likewise, when studied in two patients, kappa-deleting recombination excision circles (KRECs) in dried blood spots from newborn Guthrie cards of two patients were found to be normal, suggesting normal B cell development.",

Although such cells are not derived from hematopoietic stem cells, they are nonetheless integral to lymphoid organogenesis, such as in the development of lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, splenic marginal zones, follicular dendritic cells, and the formation of germinal centers in the spleen, which were absent. Further, the immune defect in this model was not fully corrected by HSCT. It is reasonable to suspect, therefore, that similar architectural cell dysfunction with resultant disruption of the immunologic niche could also play a role in IKBKB immune deficiency. Failure to correct non-immune cells with HSCT could explain the ongoing infectious complications seen years after an otherwise apparently successful, lymphoid engrafted transplant in IKBKB immune deficiency. The absence of splenic germinal centers and lack of tonsils and lymphoid tissues in the autopsies of patients who died post-HSCT, and absent specific vaccine responses despite excellent donor T- and B- cell chimerism, supports that HSCT does not fully correct all aspects of the immune deficiency in IKBKB.",

Commercially available next-generation sequencing gene panels for immune deficiency disorders (including many SCID panels) increasingly include IKBKB, which should facilitate diagnosis, although not always in a timely manner before HSCT. In our series, two of the three patients surviving HSCT had serious life-threating infections before transplant, including a case of multiple Serratia marcescens intracerebral abscesses, where the long-term neurocognitive outcome was initially unclear. We have tended to be aggressive with antimicrobials and other supportive care measures, with the goal of reaching HSCT as quickly as possible. This strategy has resulted in long-term survival of 2/6 infants receiving HSCT with active infections. That being said, we suspect that survival will be significantly improved with current newborn screening strategies, in the absence of pre-HSCT infection.",

Our center currently uses once daily intravenous dosing of busulfan for 4 days (aiming for an area under the curve approximating 4000 \u03bcmol/L*min), fludarabine 1.33 mg/kg/dose for 4 days, and rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin 2.5 mg/kg/dose for 3 days.

Of interest, one of our long-term survivors who was fully engrafted developed primary Mycobacterium tuberculosis pulmonary disease at 14-months post-HSCT. With appropriate therapy, the infection resolved, suggesting HSCT corrected enough of the immune deficiency. In contrast to our post-HSCT patients with IKBKB immune deficiency, Miot et al. found that bacterial infections only recurred at >6-months post-HSCT for NEMO deficiency in 2/27 patients [23]. We hypothesize that failure of HSCT to improve all aspects of innate and adaptive immune function after transplant, as shown by the number of ongoing serious bacterial and Mycobacterial infections and lack of protective specific antibody responses to vaccinations, could be because HSCT does not correct cells of non-hematopoietic origin important in the immune response that are also dependent upon IKK/NF-\u03baB signaling. A similar pattern of incomplete immune correction and ongoing bacterial and viral infections after HSCT has been reported in a patient with the related autosomal dominant anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency due to hypermorphic I\u03baB\u03b1 defect [28].",
