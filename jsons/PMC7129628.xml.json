SARS, political turmoil and other fast moving events seem to be occurring with more frequency. So how do we learn about and monitor a major health issue such as an epidemic or serious health hazard on the Internet? You can begin your research with the traditional search engines that will list thousand of entries. To narrow your search for information on a particular epidemic or outbreak of a disease in a certain region, we suggest you begin with some of the following resources.",

You can find the most recent information about infectious diseases, epidemics and other serious health hazards worldwide at the CDC site. The World Health Organization,2 WHO, web site is another good site for information on health issues around the world. The site is set up with major announcements on the home page that allows those searching for information to quickly get to the key issues at hand. Announcements about major epidemics such as SARS and regional outbreaks of cholera or other health threats are prominently displayed on the home page so you can concentrate on a specific region of concern or on a particular type of health issue.",
