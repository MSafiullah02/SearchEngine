Pulmonary complications following HSCT are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. These complications may be classified into infectious versus noninfectious, and early versus late based on the time of occurrence post-transplant. Thus, exclusion of infectious etiologies is the first step in the diagnoses of pulmonary complications. Late onset noninfectious pulmonary complications typically occur 3 months posttransplant. Bronchiolitis obliterans is the major contributor to late-onset pulmonary complications, and its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and current therapeutic approaches are discussed. Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome is another important complication which usually occurs early, although its onset may be delayed. Organizing pneumonia is important to recognize due to its responsiveness to corticosteroids. Other late onset noninfectious pulmonary complications discussed here include pulmonary venoocclusive disease, pulmonary cytolytic thrombi, pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis, thoracic air leak syndrome, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders.",

We define late onset complications are occurring 3 months after post-HSCT (Fig. 1) . In this chapter, we discuss late noninfectious pulmonary complications in HSCT, and current concepts on their pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management. The primary focus will be on bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) which is the most common and carries the highest mortality of the late onset noninfectious complications [81] . The other late onset noninfectious complications that will be discussed include idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, organizing pneumonia, pulmonary venoocclusive disease, pulmonary cytolytic thrombi, pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis, thoracic air leak syndrome, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders.",

Most treatment protocols are based on combinations of immunosuppressive drugs and, until recently, were largely based on expert opinion. Traditionally, immunosuppression in the form of systemic steroids for extended periods has been used; alternatively, calcineurin inhibitors and azathioprine, agents that impair lymphocyte activation and proliferation, have been employed. Long-term, high-intensity immunosuppression is no longer recommended due to the increased risk of infections [91] .",

A retrospective single-center study over two distinct timeperiods comparing steroids alone (earlier timeperiod) versus combined steroids and etanercept showed significant improvement in survival to hospital discharge [80] . However, the more recent use of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens and improved supportive care may have accounted for this improvement. Patients with late-onset IPS who responded to etanercept have greatly improved short-and long-term mortality [79] . Results in children have been similarly promising, with complete response in 20% of patients [97] . A randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial comparing corticosteroids with placebo to corticosteroids with etanercept was inconclusive due to slow patient accrual and early termination [96] . Other potential therapies are under investigation. Blockade of NF-\u03baB, a transcription factor downstream of the TNF-\u03b1 receptor, has shown promise in murine models [30] .

According to reported literature, prevalence of TALS post allogenic HSCT is reported to be 0.83-5.7% with a median time range of 202-575 days post HSCT [6] . The mechanism of air leak in BOS is secondary to increased intra-alveolar pressure leading to alveolar rupture into the pulmonary interstitium with subsequent retrograde dissection of air into the mediastinum and subcutaneous tissue causing pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. Similarly, rupture into the pleural space causes pneumothorax [62] . CT scan of the chest is the imaging modality of choice and can detect air in the pleural space, mediastinum, and subcutaneous tissue.

In a study of 21,686 HSCT patients' risk factors such as unrelated or HLA mismatched donors, use of ATG or monoclonal antibodies against T cells for GVHD prophylaxis or treatment, T cell depleted donor marrow, age >50 years and second HSCT were identified. The incidence of PTLD ranged from 0.2% in patients with no risk factors to more than 8% with more than 3 risk factors [49] . The pathogenesis of post HSCT PTLD is attributed to proliferation of donor Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infected B cells in the setting of weakened T-cell immunity. Though post HSCT is common in the lymph nodes, spleen, and liver, pulmonary involvement occurs in about 20% of the cases. Median onset is around 4-6 months post HSCT [3] . Clinical presentation varies and could range from asymptomatic to fulminant tumor lysis syndrome. CT scans of the chest are notable for multiple pulmonary nodules with basal and peripheral predominance, mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, patchy consolidation, pleural effusion, and chest wall or pleural-based masses [70] . Diagnosis may require a biopsy or could be made via noninvasive methods in the appropriate clinical setting. A probable diagnosis is made by increased EBV DNA levels in the setting of lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly and when other causes have been ruled out, proven disease requires a biopsy. Treatment strategies include rituximab, reduction of immunosuppression, donor lymphocyte infusion, chemotherapy, and EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte infusions [77] . The prognosis of PTLD post HSCT is poor compared to that occurring after solid organ transplantation [62] .",
