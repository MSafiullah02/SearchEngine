It is estimated that approximately 350 million people are under the risk of leishmaniasis infection and 12 million are infected (Alvar et al., 2012). In southern Europe, leishmaniasis is a zoonotic protozoan disease caused by Leishmania infantum. This parasite is transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies under natural conditions during feeding. Although various phlebotomine species have been implicated in the transmission of L. infantum in Europe, only two species are the most important vector of canine leishmaniosis in the Iberian Peninsula: Phlebotomus perniciosus and Phlebotomus ariasi (Lucientes et al., 2005). Female Phlebotomus feed on a variety of vertebrate hosts, including humans, livestock species, dogs, wild rabbits, hares, rodents and cats.",

Severe chronic diffuse pyogranulomatous dermatitis extending diffusely from the superficial dermis to the subcutis was noted. Inflammation was characterized by dense infiltrates of macrophages, few neutrophils, low numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells, and rare multinucleate giant cells. The auricular cartilage was unaffected. This lesion was accompanied by areas of necrosis in the dermis and proteinaceous edema and serocellular crusts. Macrophages and multinucleate giant cells contained large numbers of oval organisms with an eccentric nucleus and pale cytoplasm, measuring approximately 3 to 4 \u03bcm in diameter, compatible with Leishmania spp. amastigotes or Histoplasma spp. yeasts were observed (Fig. 2\n). To determine the presence of Leishmania parasites in tissue section, immunohistochemistry was performed using a standard protocol with an Autostainer Link48\u2122 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and an in-house rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for L. infantum. Blocking of endogenous peroxidase activity (Dako REAL\u2122 Peroxidase-Blocking Solution, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) was performed before sections were incubated for 30 min with the primary antiserum at room temperature (RT) (1 in 500 dilution in EnVision Flex\u2122 antibody diluent, Dako). Thereafter, sections were incubated for 30 min at RT with Dako EnVision+ System-HRP,Rb\u2122. The substrate used for detection was 3.3\u2032-diaminobenzidine incubated for 10 min. Sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin for 8 min (EnVision\u2122 FLEX Hematoxylin, Dako) and covered in slides. For the negative control, the primary antibody was replaced with non-immune rabbit serum. A biopsy sample of the lymph node from a dog with clinical leishmaniosis was included as a positive control. The abundant oval microorganisms present within the cytoplasm of dermal macrophages stained positively (brown) (Fig. 3\n).",

All samples were diluted 1:20 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the endpoint titer of positive samples was determined by preparing serial twofold dilutions of the serum starting from the cutoff value. Immediately thereafter, 20 \u03bcL of every diluted serum sample were applied per well. The slides were incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C in a moist chamber. Slides were then washed twice with PBS for 5 min and once with distilled water. Following the washing procedure, 20 \u03bcL of fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-ferret immunoglobulin G (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) diluted 1:16 in Evans blue solution were added to each well. The slides were incubated in a moist chamber at 37 \u00b0C for an additional 30 min in the dark. The washing procedure was repeated, and several drops of mounting medium were then added to the cover slips. Slides were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Leica DM750 RH; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) at 400 \u00d7 magnification and each well was compared to the fluorescent pattern observed in the positive and negative controls. The samples were examined by two different researchers. The cutoff for this technique was set to 1:20 dilution by analyzing 8 serum samples from ferrets with a negative result for Leishmania real-time PCR in blood. The same procedure was repeated with the modification of fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-dog immunoglobulin G (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom). Due to the lack of ferret positive reference serum samples, the ferret IFAT was determined by carrying out a parallel canine test run, using positive serum control (a dog from Spain with L. infantum confirmed with positive L. infantum culture) and negative serum control (dog from United Kingdom, a non-endemic area). Positive and negative controls were included on each slide. The result of the ferret IFAT was positive at 1:160 dilution with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-ferret immunoglobulin G.

However, experimental infection has been described in ferrets used as animal models for the study of antileishmanial compounds (White et al., 1989). In dogs, the evolution and pathogenesis of natural infection is highly variable and not easily comparable with experimental infection. There may also be differences in the clinical course as well as in antibody production, among others. This situation therefore could be extrapolable in ferrets.",

Recent data about seropositivity rate of L. infantum in dogs in the East of Spain confirms that detection of anti-Leishmania antibodies was higher compared to the rest of the pathogens analyzed including Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia canis, Borrelia burgdorferi and Dirofilaria immitis in this region (Mir\u00f3 et al., 2013). Human leishmaniasis has also been detected in the Valencia region and a recent outbreak of cutaneous leishmaniasis was described (Roth-Damas et al., 2017). In this sense, One Health context confirms the endemic nature and the high prevalence of the infection in the European Mediterranean regions and the potential possibility to detect the presence of L. infantum infection in other animals living in the same geographical area.",
