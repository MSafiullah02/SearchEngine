Existing global centrality measures suffer from the high computational complexity and unrealistic assumptions, limiting their applications on real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a new centrality measure, Node Conductance, to effectively detect spanning structural hole nodes and predict the formation of new edges. Node Conductance is the sum of the probability that node i is revisited at r-th step, where r is an integer between 1 and infinity. Moreover, with the help of node embedding techniques, Node Conductance is able to be approximately calculated on big networks effectively and efficiently. Thorough experiments present the differences between existing centralities and Node Conductance, its outstanding ability of detecting influential nodes on both static and dynamic network, and its superior efficiency compared with other global centralities.",

Node Conductance intuitively captures the connectivity of the graph from the target-node-centric view. Meanwhile, Node Conductance is more adequate in real applications by relaxing the assumption that information spreads only along ideal paths. Intuitively speaking, Node Conductance merges degree and betweenness centralities. Nodes with huge degree are more likely to be revisited in short random walks, and high betweenness nodes are more likely to be revisited in longer random walks. We further prove the approximability of Node Conductance from the induced subgraph formed by the target node and its neighborhoods. In other words, Node Conductance could be well approximated by the short random walks. This insight helps us calculate Node Conductance on big networks effectively and efficiently.",

Node Conductance is calculated by DeepWalk with the setting m = 80, l = 40, w = 6, and d = 128, the same setting in [21] . As Node Conductance is the by-product of DeepWalk, the actual running time of Node Conductance is the same as DeepWalk. As presented in the beginning of the section, Eigenvector centrality and PageRank are approximately calculated and we set the error tolerance used to check convergence in power method iteration to 1e\u221210. Betweenness are approximately calculated by randomly choosing 1000 pivots. More pivots requires more running time. Subgraph Centrality and Network Flow Betweenness do not have corresponding approximations. Time costs of some global centralities are listed in Table 4 . Approximate Eigenvector, Subgraph Centrality and Network Flow Betweenness are not able to finish calculating in a reasonable amount of time on these three datasets. Node Conductance calculated by DeepWalk is as fast as the approximate PageRank and costs much less time than approximate Betweenness. Comparing with the existing global centralities, Node Conductance computed by DeepWalk is much more scalable and capable to be performed on big datasets.",

For example, point (x, y) denotes that nodes that are ranked from (1000x) to (1000(x + 1)) belong to y communities on average. In Fig. 2 , all of the six metrics are able to reflect the decreasing trend of spanning communities number. It is obvious that Node Conductance provides the smoothest curve comparing with the other five metrics, which indicates its outstanding ability to capture node status from a structural point of view.

Thus, degree has advantage to achieve higher ranking coefficient in Table 5 but performs bad as shown in Fig. 2 . As for the curves of PageRank, the tails are quite different from the curves of Node Conductance. In Fig. 2e , the tail does not smooth.

Nodes in the first snapshot are ranked decreasingly by their degree. We also count the newly created connections for every node. Figure 3 presents strong evidence of preferential attachment. However, there exist some peaks in the long tail of the curve and the peak should not be ignored as it almost reaches 50 and shows up repeatedly. Figure 3b presents the relationship between increasing degree and Node Conductance. Comparing the left parts of these two curves, Node Conductance fails to capture the node with the biggest degree change. On the other hand, Node Conductance curve is smoother and no peak shows up in the long tail of the curve. Degree-based preferential attachment applies to the high degree nodes, while for the nodes with fewer edges, this experiment suggests that there is a new expression of preferential attachmentthe probability of a node to get connected to a new node is proportional to its Node Conductance.",
