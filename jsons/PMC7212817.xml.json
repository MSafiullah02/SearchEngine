Because it has only been studied for just over three months, our understanding of this disease is still incomplete, particularly its sequelae and long-term outcomes. Knowledge about COVID-19, including its presentation and treatment, is changing very rapidly, and guidelines are quickly being created and updated. Therefore, it is important to remain current by engaging in frequent reviews of new research.",

As of April 14, 2020, very little has been written about the rehabilitation needs or outcomes for patients with COVID-19 after discharge from acute care. Upon thoughtful consideration of the question, it appears that the topics of greatest importance to allied health professionals treating patients with COVID-19 are the physical, cognitive, and psychosocial presentation of survivors, the procedures that would be required within a rehabilitation department, and the treatment that should be provided. These three topics are discussed in order below.",

            "text": "Much of what has been published is based on expert opinion but not on direct observation of the actual trajectories of patients with COVID-19. Many of the early papers came from China and Italy , the locations that had the earliest experience with COVID-19; these can potentially provide insight into longer-term outcomes and ongoing patient needs. Organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and physiotherapy organizations have also written acute-care clinical practice guidelines for patients with COVID-19 [1,2]. Some authors have extrapolated based on postacute patient presentations and the rehabilitation needs of patients with similar conditions, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and sepsis, and from those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care and assisted mechanical ventilation for other reasons [1-7]. These suggestions have been included here, and research on these conditions has informed what follows here regarding patient presentation and rehabilitation. However, the physical presentations of SARS and MERS are different than that of COVID-19, and the experiences of patients with these diseases are not necessarily the same as those of COVID-19 patients. SARS mainly causes respiratory symptoms along with diarrhea, while MERS causes more gastrointestinal and kidney symptoms along with respiratory symptoms [4,8]. COVID-19 appears to cause a wider variety of symptoms that are related to many body systems (eg, cardiac, kidney, and nervous systems) [4,9-12]. SARS and MERS are more lethal than COVID-19, with fatality rates of approximately 10% and 36%, respectively, and patients with both diseases are more likely to be hospitalized and require mechanical ventilation [8].",

CIP causes difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation, generalized and symmetrical weakness (distal greater than proximal, but including diaphragmatic weakness), distal sensory loss, atrophy, and decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes [15,16]. It is associated with pain, loss of range of motion, fatigue, incontinence, dysphagia, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and cognitive loss [15]. Muscle biopsies and electromyographic testing can be diagnostic [15,16]; however, it is unclear how often these tests are performed in acute care settings post\u2013COVID-19.",

It is associated with exposure to corticosteroids, paralytics, and sepsis. The clinical presentation is similar to CIP but with more proximal than distal weakness and sensory preservation [15,16]. For both CIP and CIM, the cranial nerves and facial muscles are preserved [16]. Patients recover from myopathy more completely and quickly than from polyneuropathy; however, with both conditions, weakness, loss of function and quality of life, and poor endurance may persist for up to two years or even longer [15,16]. These prolonged changes are out of proportion with any residual loss of pulmonary function.

The virus may also persist in a patient\u2019s oropharyngeal cavity and stools for up to 15 days after they are declared cured of COVID-19 (no fever, no respiratory symptoms, 2 negative swab tests) [19].

Because of this, an additional 14 days in quarantine or discharge to a dedicated COVID-19 step-down unit has been recommended [18,20].",

They also had much higher mortality (51% vs 5%) [13]. The mechanism of cardiac injury is uncertain [13]. Presentations can include arrhythmia, cardiac insufficiency, ejection fraction decline, troponin I elevation, and severe myocarditis with reduced systolic function [4,11]. One brief report profiled a woman with acute myopericarditis/heart failure post\u2013COVID-19 [9]. As the research investigating cardiac injury included either cross-sectional studies or cohort studies with short-term follow-up (4 weeks), long-term outcomes are unknown [4,21]. Persistent tachycardia was common after SARS; however, it tended to resolve itself and was not associated with increased risk of death [4,13].

Isolation is easier at home, and the burden on inpatient services would be lessened [29,32]. However, for this to be a viable choice, enhanced homecare services and outpatient rehabilitation must be available and able to provide a level of care on par with inpatient rehabilitation. This mode of delivery may be difficult to institute if home care staff are restricted from entering patients\u2019 homes [33]. However, given the right precautions, home-based care may be safer for patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and for other patients in a rehabilitation unit [33]. Home-based therapy can be provided over the internet and telephone via telerehabilitation [28]. Both assessment and treatment may be provided, either synchronously (ie, in real time) or asynchronously (eg, a prerecorded customized exercise plan). It is important that processes are put in place to ensure that patients and therapists can use this method successfully, given the rehabilitation needs and comfort with technology of the individual patient. One or more in-person visits may be required as well. Telerehabilitation may also be a good choice for patients being discharged from inpatient rehabilitation to continue their treatment and promote further recovery [30,32].",

Deep, slow breathing, thoracic expansion (with shoulder elevation), diaphragmatic breathing, mobilization of respiratory muscles, airway clearance techniques (as needed), and positive expiratory pressure devices can be added based on assessed needs [38,39]. Care must be taken to avoid overloading the respiratory system and causing distress [7]. One randomized controlled trial showed a significant improvement in respiratory function, endurance, quality of life, and depression from 2 sessions of 10 minutes of respiratory rehabilitation per week for 6 weeks following discharge from acute care [36]. Rehabilitation included respiratory muscle training with a positive expiratory pressure device, cough exercises, diaphragmatic training (using 1 to 3 kilograms of weight on the abdomen in supine), chest stretching, and pursed-lip breathing. Patients should be monitored closely for shortness of breath, decreased SaO2 (<95%), blood pressure <90/60 or >140/90, heart rate >100 beats per minute, temperature >37.2 \u00baC, excessive fatigue, chest pain, severe cough, blurred vision, dizziness, heart palpitations, sweating, loss of balance, and headache [3,38].",

Early mobilization should include frequent posture changes, bed mobility, sit-to-stand, simple bed exercises, and ADLs, while respecting the patient\u2019s respiratory and hemodynamic states [1,7]. Active limb exercises should be accompanied by progressive muscle strengthening (suggested program: 8-12 repetition-maximum load for 8-12 repetitions, 1 to 3 sets with 2 minutes rest between sets, 3 sessions a week for 6 weeks) [3,38]. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation can be used to assist with strengthening. Aerobic reconditioning can be accomplished with overland walking, cycle or arm ergometry, or a NuStep cross trainer [7]. Initially, aerobic activity should be kept to less than 3 metabolic equivalents of task. Later, progressive aerobic exercise should be increased to 20-30 minutes, 3-5 times a week. Balance work should be incorporated. Studies on the effectiveness of exercise interventions after SARS showed benefits for endurance, maximum oxygen consumption, and strength [40].",
