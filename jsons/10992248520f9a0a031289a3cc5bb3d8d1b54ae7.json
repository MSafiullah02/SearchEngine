This includes 6 public health education, social distancing measures, restric-7 tion of air travel, and the implementation of curfew rules. 8 Health care systems are facing enormous pressure to cope 9 with the current burden of cases and to prepare for the 10 anticipated surge in the number of patients [1] . 11 Urologists are facing a unique unprecedented situation 12 that involves applying the principles of disaster medicine to 13 our patients for the first time at national and international 14 levels. One of the main dilemmas in this situation is how to 15 keep patients safe while reducing elective work to a mini-16 mum, as well as protecting oneself and other staff members. 17 COVID-19 is presenting health care systems with challenges 18 that have a limited evidence base to guide us through the 19 surge of the pandemic to manage patients safely [2] .",

Proietti et al [5] have proposed a simplified 57 protocol for triaging patients with urinary stones during the 58 pandemic. The authors recommend a conservative approach 59 in managing cases of renal colic to avoid in-hospital admis-60 sions. They also recommend insertion of ureteric stents and 61 nephrostomy tubes under local anaesthetic, if possible, to 62 spare a ventilator. Their protocol includes a telephone con-63 sultation to screen patients for history and/or symptoms 64 suggestive of COVID-19. Any patient with suspected or con-65 firmed COVID-19 requiring urgent endourological interven-66 tion would be managed in a dedicated operating room. The 67 authors suggest a priority assessment for patients scheduled 68 for stone surgical intervention that is based on several param-69 eters: stone size and location; obstructive uropathy; symp-70 tom control; presence of an indwelling ureteric stent or 71 nephrostomy tube; and other related factors such as a solitary 72 kidney or impaired renal function. On the basis of their model, 73 surgery for a patient with a unilateral nonobstructing renal 74 stone and normal renal function can be postponed, whereas 75 cases with a solitary kidney or obstructing ureteric stones 76 should be prioritised. Patients with urinary stones represent a 77 wide spectrum of different case scenarios that need a judi-78 cious clinical decision to prioritise management. 79 Prad\u00e8re et al [6] addressed the safety of nonsteroidal 80 anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen in 81 urological practice in light of some recent reports raising 82 concerns about whether NSAIDs worsens COVID-19",

The BAUS COVID-19 strategy for laparoscopic/ 93 robotic surgery published on March 30, 2020 [4] noted the 94 arguments circulating about the safety of laparoscopic sur-95 gery in the COVID-19 era and concluded that there is 96 currently insufficient evidence to either recommend or 97 prohibit the use of laparoscopy. Caution is required in 98 making decisions on whether to operate in all urgent but 99 nonemergency cases. Aerosolisation, which can occur in all 100 types of surgery, carries a theoretical risk to staff. Laparo-101 scopic surgery is potentially an aerosol-generating proce-102 dure (like electrocautery of any blood/tissue/fluid). The 103 BAU Q7 S recommendation is to wear full personal protective 104 equipment with FFP2/3 masks and visors when operating 105 on a COVID-positive or COVID-suspected patient. In addi-106 tion, minimising operating time, maximising patient safety, 107 and promoting expedited patient recovery are key consid-108 erations to weigh against the possible risk of viral aero-109 solisation. Minimisation of chest complications (atelectasis/ 110 pneumonia) may be very important in reducing the overall 111 risk to the patient from surgery [4]. 112 The American College of Surgeons concluded that there 113 are insufficient data to recommend for or against an open 114 versus laparoscopic approach; however, the surgical team 115 should choose an approach that minimises time and max-116 imises safety for both patient and health care staff [7]. The 117 European Association of Urology (EAU) Robotic Urology 118 Section emphasises the use of preoperative testing for 119 Covid19 and postponement of surgery, if at all possible [8]. 120 By contrast, the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) has 121 stated that laparoscopy should generally not be used as it 122 risks aerosol formation and infection [9]. Chinese and Ital-123 ian experience reflects this. The safety mechanisms advo-124 cated (filters, traps, careful deflation) are difficult to imple-125 ment. The RCS advises that laparoscopy should only be 126 considered in extremely selected cases for which the 127 mortality benefit is substantially beyond doubt in the cur-128 rent situation.",

The COVID-19 132 pandemic has highlighted the importance of telehealth as a 133 means of reducing the risk of cross-contamination caused 134 by close contact in the delivery of care.A key factor in slowing the transmission of a virus is \"social 135 distancing\"[1], which decreases person-to-person contact.136For patients with COVID-19 and those concerned that they 137 might be infected, telehealth can help with remote assess-138 ment (triage) and the provision of care. For individuals not 139 infected with COVID-19, especially those at higher risk of 140 being affected (eg, older adults with preexisting medical 141 conditions), telehealth can provide convenient access to rou-142 tine care without the risk of exposure in a congested hospital 143 or in medical practice waiting rooms [10]. 144 Since telemedicine is not included as a standard part of 145 medical training, urologists may struggle initially to adapt 146 to this novel approach. Nevertheless, the current situation is 147 imposing a shift to telemedicine in its simplest forms. 148 Urologists are currently learning how to manage patients 149 through virtual/telephone clinics and how to hold multi-150 disciplinary team meetings via video conferencing. 151 Medical education also provides relevant examples of 152 \"learning on the job\" from a telemedicine perspective. The 153 EAU 2020 congress was initially postponed from March to 154 July 2020. Later, a final decision was taken to cancel the 155 physical meeting and to instead hold virtual interactive 156 online sessions to spread knowledge while maintaining 157",
