            "text": "To the Editor: Iatrogenic burn injuries are rarely reported in neonates. A 3-d-old neonate with meconium aspiration syndrome was being mechanically ventilated in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). His diaper was kept open as he had perineal rash. Dry gauze pads were placed under buttocks to provide a soft surface. During an episode of desaturation, endotracheal suctioning was performed. After the procedure was over, while changing the diaper, the care-giving nurse suddenly noticed that the gauze pads and diaper have caught flames. Though she immediately threw away the burning materials, the infant sustained first-to-second degree burns over the buttocks and posterior surface of thighs. Burn management was started immediately in consultation with plastic surgeons. Event investigation by electrical and bio-medical engineers found that the radiant warmer and other equipment attached with the infant (ventilator, syringe pumps, multi-para monitor) were undamaged and fully functional. The electrical circuits of NICU were also intact. Incident analysis revealed that after suctioning, oxygen tube used to provide free-flow oxygen during suctioning was left open. The nurse rubbed her hands with alcohol based hand rub (ABHR) before and after suctioning. Friction of hand-rubbing and subsequent touching of polyethylene surface of diaper probably generated static electricity by triboelectric effect [1]. The prerequisites for fire i.e., an ignition source (electrostatic discharge), fuel (alcohol vapors) and oxygen, probably resulted in fire accident with combustion of gauze pads and diaper.",
