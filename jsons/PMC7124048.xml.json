By a lengthy and politically repressive process, capitalist Southeast Asia refashioned its inherited structures of colonial capitalism (generally applicable even to non-colonised Thailand) to reach what was effectively a level of intermediate success, albeit marked with national variations. In bad times, the Southeast Asian NIEs did not sink to the truly wretched level of disastrous postcolonial experiences.

First was the \u2018peculiar arc of the Cold War in the region\u2019 because of which \u2018Washington made every effort to create loyal, capitalistically prosperous, authoritarian, and anti-communist regimes\u2019 (Anderson 1998b: 300). Second was the \u2018accident of the region\u2019s geographical propinquity to Japan\u2019, which led to Japan\u2019s becoming Southeast Asia\u2019s \u2018single most important external investor\u2026both as extractor of natural resources\u2026and in industrial and infrastructural development\u2019. A third condition of possibility was, \u2018ironically enough\u2026[the] Maoist project of building a mighty autarchic, socialist economy outside the global capitalist order [that] kept China from playing a significant economic role in, or in competition with Southeast Asia until the middle 1980s\u2019 (Anderson 1998b: 301\u20132). Finally, the opening of post-WWII economic opportunities and practices of postcolonial discrimination against their \u2018overseas Chinese\u2019 (in various ways and to different extents) served to \u2018encourage people of Chinese ancestry to concentrate their energies and ambitions in the private commercial sector\u2019, effectively making the Chinese minority the real domestic motor of the \u2018miracle\u2019 (Anderson 1998b: 304\u20135).",

Two decades after the 1997 crisis, however, none of them has attained the developed status their leaders had craved and which would be akin to a \u2018second Asian miracle\u2019 (Pempel and Tsunekawa 2015: 3). On the contrary, standard indicators seem to suggest that these economies are mired in middle-income mediocrity or at risk of losing their competitiveness. Unlike Northeast Asia (except China, then, and North Korea still), which had acquired its advanced status in the era of favourable regional conditions, Southeast Asia (except Singapore) had been \u2018developing\u2019 somewhat impressively but stopped short of becoming \u2018developed\u2019.

The USA-backed international trade regime under the World Trade Organization (WTO) reduced exceptional treatment for developing countries on import restriction, export promotion, quota allocation, and property rights. These countries now find it more difficult to privilege firms located within their borders to foster national economic development. However, a more competitive global economy does not make the failure of developing economies inevitable. For instance, Aseema Sinha (2016) vividly analyses how the pressure of trade liberalisation under the WTO served to revitalise Indian pharmaceutical and textile industries. In both cases, the private sector in India was highly resistant to liberalisation, but WTO obligations strengthened the influence of reformers in the state and forced the private sector to change its preference. Entering the twenty-first century, the Indian pharmaceutical industry strategically turned to specialising in the production and marketing of generic medicines and boosted its investment in product development. Likewise, to prepare for the abolition of the multi-fibre agreement expected in 2005, India\u2019s textile industry changed its strategy drastically from sheltering under state protection to seeking export promotion and international competitiveness. To this end, firms in the industry increased R&D expenditure and extended backward and forward linkages. The two industries are now highly successful. (Sinha\u2019s analysis interestingly shows that these changes were led by reformers in the state who built coalitions of new winners and overcame the resistance of losers.)",

The Filipino oligarchy was rooted in vast landholdings during late colonial times. The oligarchs became adept at controlling a system of electoral representation which, \u2018adapted to the ambitions and social geography of the mestizo nouveaux riches\u2019 (Anderson 1998a: 201), allowed them to move \u2018from private wealth to state power, from provincial bossism to national hegemony\u2019 (Anderson 1998a: 213). The oligarchy of Thailand was formed from the elite power centers located within the military, the bureaucracy, and big businesses but were socially and ideologically placed under a constitutional, yet independently wealthy monarchy. Oligarchy came later in Indonesia where \u2018a system of power relations that enable[d] the concentration of wealth and authority and its collective defense\u2019 was constituted \u2018at a time of growth and market capitalism during the New Order\u2019 (Hadiz and Robison 2014: 37). Here, oligarchic composition underwent a politically significant ethnic change with the emergence of a pribumi, an \u2018indigenous\u2019 but, for all purposes and intents, non-Chinese, component. The promotion of an ethnically comparable Bumiputera dimension to oligarchy in Malaysia was made part of state policy. Through state regulation, investment, and sponsorship that systematically began from 1970, the oligarchy was reconstituted from its earlier postcolonial form of an ethnic division of power between the Malay political elite and the (largely) Chinese economic elite.",

When Soeharto\u2019s dictatorship ended, a competitive electoral system was installed but expectations of liberal democracy were not realised. Instead, an \u2018expansion of costly electoral politics [had] facilitated the ascendance of business elites who [could] use their capital to pursue legislative positions and Cabinet posts that were previously limited\u2019 (Fukuoka 2013: 59). Effectively, therefore, democratisation, including vigorous electoral exercises, did not eliminate a corrupt and unfair fusion of wealth and power but changed \u2018the old form of accommodation between the ruling politico-bureaucrats and the business elites\u2019 (Fukuoka 2012: 87).

Instead, they sought the production of niche products and services and the exploitation and processing of natural resources. In Thaksin\u2019s Thailand, the government actively targeted specific sectors for national development, but this intention was not matched by the installation of stern mechanisms to enforce, monitor, and evaluate the outcomes of those policies (10.1007/978-3-319-55038-1_10, this volume).

It may not be a historical accident, therefore, that Thailand, where Southeast Asia\u2019s developmental projects unravelled first, has been the site of the most protracted and deadly political battles between unforeseen alignments of oligarchic insecurities, middle-class conservatism, and populist grievances, virtually all of which were let loose by the 1997 crisis. The military coup mounted against Thaksin after he had been prime minister for only five and a half years signalled the ebb of the populism which rose with him. Yet, until a second military coup in 2014 crushed it, populism remained a powerful force that repeatedly brought Thaksin\u2019s allies to power. Whatever else came out of the decade-long battle between the \u2018red shirts\u2019 and the \u2018yellow shirts\u2019, perhaps Thailand lost an opportunity to implement and benefit from at least some of Thaksin\u2019s planned upgrading projects.",

Fierce opposition to these proposals was quickly raised by private sector organisations such as Malaysian Employers\u2019 Federation, Small and Medium Industry Associations of Malaysia, Malaysian Agricultural Producers Association, and the Malaysian International Chambers of Commerce and Industry. In response, the government shelved the idea of unemployment insurance. Only because the ruling coalition faced a serious electoral challenge from the opposition (the original source of the minimum wage proposal), Najib announced in April 2012 that private sector firms must guarantee a minimum wage (determined by the government) for their employees, including foreign migrant workers. Pressed by the private sector once more, the government again retreated, permitting a non-implementation \u2018grace period\u2019 (of up to one year) and allowing firms employing foreign workers to be exempted from certain levies. In other words, the NEM\u2019s aim to discourage the use of cheap foreign workers was largely undone (Suzuki 2014: 152\u201361).",

Locational decisions of foreign lead firms largely depend on the availability of local human, technological, and institutional resources. For Coe and Yeung (2015: 173), however, technological downgrading (not upgrading) may sometimes bring comparative advantage to certain localities because it matches production for lower-income markets. However, to sustain economic growth, a middle-income country must obtain higher technology portions of global production networks located in its territory.

Significantly, the resilience and dynamism of ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs, Anderson\u2019s fourth condition of possibility, still applies with remarkable results in rubber-based manufacturing in Malaysia. Private sector initiatives also benefitted from a long history of substantial public sector support in many areas of the rubber industry, including R&D. Such support was originally provided by the Rubber Research Institute Malaysia (RRIM), founded in 1925 to develop the rubber industry. Presently, the state\u2019s principal agency for supporting the rubber industry is the Malaysian Rubber Board (MRB), which, in 1998, took over the responsibilities of RRIM. Drawing on RRIM\u2019s vast research experience and accumulated knowledge of rubber and its production, the MRB laboratory helped develop high-quality medical gloves that met new and stringent standards of the USA and Europe.

Beginning as the world\u2019s largest exporter of crude palm oil, the industry progressed to exporting refined palm oil in the mid-1970s. By the 1990s, it had advanced further downstream to produce intermediate goods such as vegetable oils and fats and oleo-chemical products. As with rubber, the state played a key role in the palm oil industry\u2019s early and intermediate stages of development. Through consciously designed policies and huge investments, the state facilitated land clearance for new plantations, the cultivation of new and higher-yielding oil palm varieties, the provision of physical infrastructure, and the construction of oil-extraction plants. The extent of the state\u2019s involvement may be gauged from its provision of social infrastructure to raise the living standards of settler communities of state-managed oil palm plantations, on the one hand, and the use of differential export taxes to assist the producers of palm oil products, on the other. Thus, the palm oil industry presently covers the whole value chain, including its higher value-added segments. For a long time, the palm oil firms were largely dependent on imported foreign technology but they have since adapted the technology to suit domestic conditions better. The industry faces two major problems today. One is its heavy reliance on a low-paid migrant labour force in the upstream activities of cultivation and care of oil palms and harvesting of fruits. A second problem is the emergence of Indonesia as a serious competitor, often with the aid of expatriate Malaysian expertise. Addressing both problems satisfactorily will require the Malaysian palm oil industry to extend and strengthen technological upgrading to obtain higher productivity gains.",

In the post-Soeharto era, business groups reduced their manufacturing activities to ease their problem of bad loans and to operate in a somewhat laissez-faire policy environment (10.1007/978-3-319-55038-1_3, this volume). These business groups have turned to the natural resource sectors of plantation agriculture and mining to take advantage of a commodity boom to regain their economic strength. (They have also moved into new domestic services, such as telecommunications, hospitals, education, media, and logistics.) The government of President Yudhoyono, however, considered a national development strategy essential for raising Indonesia to developed status and in May 2011 launched its Masterplan for the Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesian Economic Development 2011\u201325. A key strategy of this masterplan was greater extraction of value from natural resources. Even before it announced the masterplan, the government had promulgated a new law on mineral and coal mining that prohibited the export of raw mineral resources. Implemented in 2014, the new law stipulated that taxes on raw mineral exports would only be reduced when the degree of mineral processing increased. Prasetyawan (10.1007/978-3-319-55038-1_9, this volume) gives a detailed account of the implementation of the law that sought to redress an unplanned outcome of post-Soeharto decentralisation, namely, the excessive issuance of mining licenses by local governments that had been newly granted broad authority and increased fiscal resources. This conduct of local governments, which usually wanted to obtain political contributions in money, neglected economic and environmental feasibility. The state had to contend with resource-extracting MNCs that fiercely opposed the law. In the copper mining sector, the government was forced to make many concessions (including the postponement of the export ban) to the two MNCs that controlled close to 100 per cent of Indonesia\u2019s copper exports.",

Likewise, in Thailand almost two million migrants from neighbouring low-income countries were mostly unskilled workers employed in sectors such as construction, low-skill services, agriculture, fishery, food processing, and garments (10.1007/978-3-319-55038-1_2, this volume; Yamada 2014: 142\u20133). In a different form, labour is also a critical issue for the Philippines. It ranks among the world\u2019s top remittance-recipient countries and more than one in four households benefit from remittances. This bestows ambiguous reward, however, since state institutions become less motivated to promote productive activities while a sizeable part of the domestic workforce leaves the country (10.1007/978-3-319-55038-1_8, this volume).",

That does not imply that deep reforms of management and technical improvement are not important. Nor does it mean that the cheap labour advantage will last long. Fujita (10.1007/978-3-319-55038-1_4, this volume) analyses the results of reforms implemented in two major Vietnamese state-managed enterprise groups (Vinatex and VEAM). In Vietnam, where the private sector is still small and weak, the state must lead in implementing different reforms to take advantage of opportunities in the global market. The Vietnamese government had conducted reforms, including equitising and streamlining its SOEs. Certain SOE-affiliated firms are allowed considerable autonomy, including taking decisions to enter joint-venture partnerships with foreign companies. Thus, firms producing garments and motorcycle parts and components have succeeded in expanding their businesses through deeper integration with the global value chain. Their success was not solely based on cheap labour but came from earnest efforts to raise management and technical capabilities to levels that met the requirements of foreign partners. However, Vietnam remains weaker in technology-intensive and skill-based sectors as is evident from the great difficulties faced by Vinatex in the upstream segment (spinning, weaving, and dying) and VEAM in the production of trucks and agricultural machinery (10.1007/978-3-319-55038-1_4, this volume).",

Some of their domestic businesses, private and/or state-owned, strategically adapted to post-crisis and other unanticipated conditions that allowed them to chart new paths of growth. Some of those paths ran through learning processes of technological upgrading in resource-based manufacturing, niche product development in natural resource sectors, and the provision of services by leveraging on the advantages of special segments of human resources. Part of the support for those new business ventures came from state and private sector collaboration in domestic R&D or market promotion. It was far less impressive for the overall economy to persist with production based on low-cost and low-skilled labour.",

The deeper problem is whether the present modes of development can reliably sustain current rates of income improvement. For all their initial dynamism niche-oriented production and natural resource processing are bound to face competition from other countries and firms that adopt similar strategies. Besides, the sources of cheap labour will be exhausted in middle-income Southeast Asia as domestic wages rise and the influx of migrant labour runs into different problems.",

If an acknowledgement of the inherent limitations in current development strategies can be translated into firm policy, it could form the basis for institutionalising sorely needed reform. That may, in turn, produce a more equitable and less divisive distribution of the socioeconomic costs and benefits of upgrading. If not, reform will only be offered piecemeal out of self-interest by ruling elites when they have no choice but to appease populist pressures. It is here that Southeast Asian countries run into non-economic and non-technological dimensions of the middle-income trap. It is where the wise calculations of entrepreneurial initiatives and economic policies end and the unplanned interventions of deep socio-political factors begin.",
