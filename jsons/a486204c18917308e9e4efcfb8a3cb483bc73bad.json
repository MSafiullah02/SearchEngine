Actual change of temperature with altitude for the stationary atmosphere or temperature gradient is known as Environmental Lapse Rate (ELR). Generally, decrease of 6.49\u00b0C/km is considered as Environmental lapse rate. In the troposphere, atmospheric pressure also decreases rapidly with the altitude. One can understand that climbing to an altitude of 5.5 km, would put you above 50 % of the atmosphere's molecules where atmospheric pressure is 500 mb only. Actually, the heating of the surface creates warm air at surface. The warm air rises, but air expands as it rises and cools as it expands (Adiabatic cooling). Typically, the troposphere is characterized by warm air at surface and cooler air above. If the cooler air exists at surface and the warmer air above, this is called as Buoyancy. If a rising air parcel becomes saturated condensation occurs. The condensation warms the air parcel due to the release of latent heat.

Ozone (O 3 ) is effective absorbing species for solar UV radiation (200-310 nm with a maximal absorption at about 250 nm) in the stratosphere. Generally, UV-C (280-100 nm) which is highly harmful is entirely screened out by dioxygen (<200 nm) and ozone (>about 200 nm) before 35 km height.

The Auroras are seen due to the effect of energetic particles (electrons and photons) coming in the solar wind. Charged particle entering the atmosphere ionize atmospheric constituents. The aurora can be seen best in the dark sky or 'magnetic midnight' time.

Generally, the solar radiation received by earth drives the climate system. About 70 % of the incoming 'short wave' solar radiation is absorbed by the earth while around 30 % of it is reflected back to the space. When earth cools down, it releases the heat as long wave radiation. GHGs present in the atmosphere absorb this outgoing 'long wave radiation' from earth which enhances atmospheric temperature. Greenhouse is a phenomenon used in greenhouses to increase temperature capturing long wave radiation to facilitate optimum growth condition for plants. The term \"Greenhouse\" is borrowed to explain increase in temperature due to trapping of long wave radiation in the atmosphere. Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first time demonstrated global warming. Arrhenius (1896) who was awarded Nobel prize in chemistry in 1903 showed that a doubling of the atmospheric CO 2 concentration would lead to 4-5 K warming of the earth surface due to greenhouse effect. GHG increase has resulted in an increase of 0.6\u00b0C in global mean surface temperature since the 19th century. It is expected that this will further increase up to 1.4-5.8\u00b0C by 2100.

However, aerosol radiative forcing calculations have huge uncertainties which need to be corrected. The higher uncertainties are primarily due to lack of measurements from the sites of different characteristics such as rural, background, urban, desert, forest, high altitude especially from tropical regions. Considerable uncertainties also exist in quantifying the role of dust aerosols in climate variability due to the difficulty in assessing direct and indirect effects of aerosols on clouds. Aerosols alter radiative balance as well as the cloud density of the atmosphere resulting in changes in atmospheric stability and cloud microphysics, which can either foster or suppress the development of clouds and precipitation (Li et al. 2011) .

Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution signed on 1979 is considered as pioneering international instrument which has paved the way for fruitful cooperation among 49 parties in Europe (Harald et al. 2004 ). Since, air has no boundaries, pollutants are transported globally from one geographic area. Several times remote and background sites are affected by LRT. There are examples where states having no air pollution sources are affected by LRT of pollution from distance or nearby countries or states. Rodhe (1972) demonstrated air pollution transport through air mass trajectory calculations and established that acid rain occurrence in Northern Europe was mainly due to industrial sources located in the south and west. Dust from The Thar Desert has been the primary potential source of particulate pollution in the Indian subcontinent. Also, the suspended particulate matter from the dust storms originated in Oman and other middle eastern regions has been reported to have influence on air quality in south Asia (Begum et al. 2011 ). Long-range transport of dust aerosols over the Arabian sea and Indian region has been reported by Badarinath et al. (2010) . Kulshrestha and Kumar (2014) have reported LRT of pollution and its influence on rain water chemistry at Himalayan sites. According to the study, most of the acidic components such as sulphate and nitrate are transported from western airmasses and are deposited through precipitation having long term adverse impact on Himalayan ecosystem. Similarly, air pollution is the issue of transboundary transport of air pollution is an important issue between and within the countries. For example recent air pollution problem in New Delhi can be termed as transboundary pollution problem (Kulshrestha 2015) . In 1990s, exhaust of diesel driven buses was mainly responsible for air pollution in Delhi city but after the Supreme Court decision, all the busses were replaced by CNG driven buses. This gave a big relief to the citizens of Delhi. But surprisingly, SO 2 and NO 2 levels were recorded extremely high during winter season of 2015 crossing 400 micrograms per cubic meter violating the NAAQS limit of 80 micrograms per cubic meter. Such observations were never reported in recent past winters. Such sudden increase can be explained on the basis of transboundary air pollution contributed by a number of new established brick kilns being operated in nearby states such as Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab (Kulshrestha 2015) .
