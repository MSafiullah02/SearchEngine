Recent reports suggest that, in severe cases of\nCOVID-19, patients may have neurological manifestations, in addition to pulmonary\ndamage.1\u22123 In COVID-19 cases with the\ncentral nervous system involvement, as confirmed by brainstem concentration of infection,\ntreatment involves intravenous injection of drugs.4 Even with aggressive\ntreatment, prognosis is often poor and attributed to (i) delayed diagnosis, (ii) inadequate\ncomprehension of the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of the disease, (iii) lack of effective\ndrugs available, and (iv) complexity in conveying anti-COVID-19 drugs to the infected brain.\nThe intention of this Viewpoint is to deliberate if an enhanced therapeutic effect may be\naccomplished via the administration of drug therapy through the nasal cavity traversing the\ncribriform plate to access the brain, for COVID-19 cases with the central nervous system\ninvolvement.",

            "text": "Recent studies suggested two possible route of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the central nervous\nsystem.5 It is well recognized that the route of viral entry into the\ncentral nervous system includes entry via the respiratory tract followed by virus invasion of\nthe alveolar blood vessels, leading to hematogenous spread, while the entry into the central\nnervous system most likely occurs at the location of the blood-brain barrier, which is\nextremely selective in policing the entry of microbes and/or molecules. The olfactory\nneuroepithelium provides another route of entry into the central nervous system, bypassing the\nblood-brain barrier. Using the intranasal route, the drugs can reach the central nervous\nsystem via the porous cribriform plate as well as target the affected lungs. Clinical\nadministration of drugs via the intravenous route results in dilution of the drugs in the\nplasma.4 Moreover, even if drugs are injected into the cerebrospinal\nfluid, drainage into the venous blood via arachnoid villi is likely to reduce the\nconcentration of the drug. In addition to the intravenous route, the use of intranasal route\nto administer drugs offers several advantages in the management of COVID-19 with neurological\nmanifestations. The intranasal route can dispense the drugs through the cribriform plate. The\ncribriform plate is an anatomically porous bone, which is situated at the top of the nasal\ncavity. In this way, drugs can be given in a vaporized form to the inferior surface of the\nfrontal lobe, before extending to the rest of the central nervous system to accomplish an\neffective concentration in the central nervous system. The proposed route is preferred as it\nwill (a) circumvent the selectivity of the blood-brain barrier that restricts drug\npermeability to the brain tissue, (b) deliver drugs directly to the central nervous system,\n(c) exert effects of drugs at a lower dose without venous drainage, and (d) avoid adverse side\neffects due to systemic administration; (e) drugs can be given in the vaporized form to reach\nthe porous cribriform plate. Furthermore, it is anticipated that intranasal delivery can offer\nadmittance to the central nervous system without affecting the integrity of the blood-brain\nbarrier. This proposed route renders obvious benefits over the conventional intravenous route,\nin that it will permit utilization of water-soluble drugs to attain an effective concentration\nof drugs at the epicenter of infection, overcome the blood-brain barrier impediment, and\nproduce minimal adverse effects due to nonsystemic administration and dose adjustment at a\nquicker pace. This is further strengthened with the fact that many drugs do not attain an\neffective concentration in the brain/central nervous system through systemic administration.\nAdditionally, the proposed delivery system will outweigh the current intrathecal and/or\nintraventricular routes that necessitate surgical procedures, thus having attendant\ncomplications. It is proposed that this route should be tested clinically in addition to the\nintravenous route. If efficacy of this route is proven, then it could either complement or\nreplace the intravenous route for relieving neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19.\nFuture research should test the efficacy of the suggested intranasal route for drug\nadministration, in addition to the intravenous route, in the management of COVID-19 involving\nneurological manifestations.",
