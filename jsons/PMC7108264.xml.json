            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus, and was associated with significant morbidity and mortality (WHO, 2004). Its pathogenesis appears to involve both a high viral load and an overexuberant immune response (Peiris et al., 2003a, Peiris et al., 2003b). However, it remains unclear as to whether a robust or depressed antibody response is associated with clinical deterioration and a more severe disease course. Such information may improve our understanding of SARS immunopathogenesis and facilitate the design of an appropriate therapeutic strategy. Using indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) (Chan et al., 2004a, Hsueh et al., 2004), we have evaluated anti-SARS-CoV IgG responses within the first month of illness among a complete cohort of SARS patients. Rates of \u201cearly\u201d seroconversion and magnitude of IgG responses in patients with different disease severities are compared.",

A total of 325 laboratory-confirmed (by serology, RT-PCR or post-mortem) SARS cases were then retrospectively evaluated for their anti-SARS-CoV IgG response and clinical disease severity. Serum samples were first collected at presentation/admission and convalescent-phase sera were collected either beyond 2 weeks of illness or >10\u201314 days apart from the acute-phase sera. All serum samples were dated from the day of fever onset. Anti-SARS-CoV IgG was detected by IFA using SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells; and IgG titres were quantified at two-fold serial dilutions starting from 1:40 (Chan et al., 2004a). Routine respiratory specimens collected at presentation, and repeated fecal specimens collected upon discharge at \u226521 days of illness were tested for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR (non-quantitative), according to WHO recommendations (Chan et al., 2004b, WHO, 2004). All serological and RT-PCR assays for SARS-CoV were performed in a BSL-2 containment facility according to CDC recommendations (CDC, 2005). The clinical characteristics and disease progression, investigation methods and details of treatment of this cohort of patients have been described elsewhere (Chan et al., 2004b, Gomersall et al., 2004, Lee et al., 2003a, Lee et al., 2003b, Lee et al., 2004, Sung et al., 2004). SARS patients who required supplemental oxygen therapy during their course of illness or admitted to ICU as a result of severe respiratory failure were regarded to have more severe disease. Supplemental oxygen was prescribed to maintain patient's oxygen saturation >95% when necessary; and severe respiratory failure was defined by failure to maintain an arterial oxygen saturation of >90% despite receiving supplemental oxygen at 50%, and/or a respiratory rate greater than 35 breaths per minute (Gomersall et al., 2004). High-dose corticosteroid \u2018rescue\u2019 therapy was given to patients when clinical and radiological progression was noted according to a standard protocol (Sung et al., 2004). Age of 65 years was also used as a cut-off in the comparison between groups since epidemiological data had implicated advanced age as a poor prognostic factor (thus more severe disease) (WHO, 2004). The cut-off value for lymphocyte counts in the comparison groups was determined based on earlier studies (Wong et al., 2003).",

Firstly, clinical and laboratory variables of patients who seroconverted \u201cearly\u201d (<median interval) were compared to those cases documented to remain sero-negative during the same time interval using \u03c7\n2-test. Variables with p\n < 0.2 in the univariate analysis were then entered into a model for logistic regression analysis. We excluded patients who had their first serum samples collected on day 0\u20133 (since IgG was only first detected on day 4 in our cohort), and those who had their first sera collected beyond day 15 (the median interval to seroconvert) from fever onset. Median time of serum collections between all comparative patient groups was not significantly different. Secondly, median anti-SARS-CoV IgG levels in convalescent-phase sera collected within 30 days were compared among patients with different disease severities and laboratory profiles using Mann\u2013Whitney U-test. Variables with p\n < 0.2 in the univariate analysis were then entered into a nonparametric regression model for analysis. Only the latest serum sample collected from each patient was included in the analysis. Median time of collecting these samples was not significantly different between all comparative patient groups. Thirdly, spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to assess correlations between IgG titres and LDH levels or lymphocyte counts within 30 days. SPSS for Windows (Release 11.5; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for the analyses, and the level of significance was set at 0.05 for all comparisons.",

But when the sub-group of patients who received high-dose corticosteroid treatment was analyzed (76% of all cases), higher IgG levels were again detected in patients with more severe diseases (Table 2). By multivariate analysis, higher IgG level was again shown to be associated with ICU-admission (p\n = 0.006) or supplemental oxygen therapy (p\n = 0.008), but not age or corticosteroid treatment (p\n > 0.05). In the corticosteroid-treated sub-group, absolute lymphopenia <1.0 \u00d7 109/L at presentation was also noted to associate with higher IgG titres (p\n = 0.028). Too few death cases had convalescent sera collected to allow a separate analysis.",

IgG can be detected as early as day 4 by IFA; seroconversion occurs by the end of the second week, and IgG surged to peak levels by the early fourth week. It has been reported that a \u201csecond\u201d late rise in antibody titre can occur after week 4, possibly related to the withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment (Woo et al., 2004). Thus our results may represent the initial rate of change of IgG levels within the first month; and they also need to be interpreted in the context of corticosteroid treatment. Our findings of more severe SARS being associated with more robust serological responses are supported by earlier observations. The development of the humoral response coincides temporally with disease progression and clinical deterioration (while viral load starts to decrease) (Hsueh et al., 2003, Nie et al., 2004, Peiris et al., 2003a). Also patients with very mild disease have relatively low antibody titres detected, and a less-sustained response (Ip et al., 2004, Lee et al., 2003a, Tso et al., 2004, Wilder-Smith et al., 2005). Similar phenomena have been observed in other viral diseases (e.g. dengue hemorrhagic fever), in which immunopathogenesis is considered important (Thein et al., 1993).",

            "text": "Our findings have several important clinical implications. Firstly, it is unlikely that disease progression and clinical deterioration result from a depressed humoral response to SARS-CoV. In fact, high titres of anti-SARS-CoV IgG were detected in patients with more severe disease. Naturally occurring neutralizing antibody activity associated with the IgG may have contributed to viral clearance to some extent (Nie et al., 2004, Temperton et al., 2005), but clearly did not confer protection against disease progression in SARS. This is also supported by our finding that higher convalescent-phase IgG titres are associated with negative pre-discharge fecal RT-PCR results. Secondly, it seems possible that a robust humoral response to SARS-CoV is one component of an overall exaggerated immune response in severe SARS, which is associated with cytokine storms (e.g IFN-gamma, IP-10) (Huang et al., 2005, Jiang et al., 2005, Wong et al., 2004). Briefly, marked elevation of Th1 cytokine IFN-\u03b3, inflammatory cytokines IL-1, -6 and -12 was noted during the initial 2 weeks of SARS. The chemokines, including neutrophil chemokine IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and Th1 chemokine IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) levels were also significantly elevated (Wong et al., 2004). In fact, when patients with detectable and undetectable acute antibody responses were compared, a much higher initial serum IFN-gamma level had been noted in the former (Huang et al., 2005). Our observation of an inverse relationship between the initial lymphocyte counts and IgG levels is also in agreement with a previous report showing a similar inverse relationship between lymphocyte counts and IFN-gamma levels (possibly through cytokine-induced apoptosis) (Huang et al., 2005). Whether the humoral response contributes directly to organ damage is unclear. The exact immunopathogenesis of SARS requires further study. Finally, since higher levels of IgG were associated with more severe disease, the use of convalescent plasma/passive immunity in the treatment of SARS is called into question. It is uncertain whether administration of an exogenous antibody will lead to aggravation of the disease (Hsueh et al., 2003). It has been suggested that if such therapy is contemplated, it should be given only very early in the course of illness or as prophylaxis (Greenough et al., 2005, Jan ter Meulen et al., 2004, Nie et al., 2004). Anecdotal reports have shown that early use of convalescent plasma therapy within the first 2 weeks was associated with lower rates of intubation and death, whereas late administration was associated with worse clinical outcomes (Cheng et al., 2005, Soo et al., 2004).",
