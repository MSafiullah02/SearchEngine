            "text": "Hemagglutination represents a useful model for virus adsorption to cells, a very convenient assay for the presence of virus in biological samples, and may be relevant to viral pathogenesis. Several members of the Coronaviridae family of enveloped RNA vi ruses were shown to possess such a hemag glutinating activity: namely bovine coronavi rus, hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis vi rus of pigs, human coronavirus strain OC43, rabbit enteric coronavirus, and avian in-fectious bronchitis virus [1] . Recently, a hem agglutinin was demonstrated on transmissi ble gastroenteritis virus [2] . However, hemag glutination by murine coronavirus had not been reported until Sugiyama and Amano [3] identified a new enteric strain of murine hep atitis virus (MHV): the diarrhea virus of in fant mice (DVIM). Like bovine coronavirus [4] and strain OC43 of human coronavirus [5] , the hemagglutinating activity of MHV-DVIM appeared to correlate with the pres ence of a structural glycoprotein of 140 kD, comprised of 2 subunits of 65-69 kD linked by disulfide bridges [6] , This presumed hem agglutinin appears distinct from the peplomer glycoprotein (named E2, S, or P) of 180-190 kD [5, 6] and its proteolytically cleaved monomers of 100-120 kD [4, 5] .

The virus band was dialyzed against TMEN buffer. All viral antigens had infectious titers of 6.0-7.3 logm PFU/ml. Red blood cells from various mammalian and avian sources were collected and washed in Alsever buffer [15] and resuspended in the appropriate buffers. Ten different buffers were tested: (v) phos phate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 [17] ; and (vi). phosphate-buffered saline with 1% kaolintreated FCS [18] , and (7-10) BABS, pH 5.75, 6.0, 6.2, or 6.4, respectively [16] , The hemag glutination assay was performed as de scribed previously [18] , except that various buffers were used, red blood cells were made up to 0.3 or 0.5% (v/v) in the appropriate buffer, and microtiter plates were incubated at 4, 22, or 37\u00b0. Control hemagglutinating antigens were either rabbit enteric coronavirus (titer 1/64 with rabbit red blood cells ) or pneumonia virus of mice (titer 1/320 with CDI mouse erythrocytes). Both antigens were kindly provided by Dr. Jean-Paul Descoteaux (Institut Armand-Frappier). As shown in table 1, all tested combina tions of buffer, source or concentration of erythrocytes, antigen, or incubation temper atures yielded negative hemagglutination ti ters. One antigen (MHV-A59) was prepared in the presence or absence of FCS to monitor for the possible presence of hemagglutina tion inhibitors in serum [16] , However, simi lar results were obtained with either antigen (table 1). Concentrated or partially purified MHV-3 and MHV-S antigens, respectively, were used to both increase viral infectivity titers and prevent reported inconsistent hem agglutination by crude antigen [9] . Even though not all possible combinations of anti gen, erythrocyte, and buffer were tested, the results presented here show that hemaggluti nation by these three strains of MHV grown on DBT cells is at least not an obvious biolog ical activity, unlike MHV-DVIM [3] . It is possible that the previously reported hemag-glutinating activity of MHV-3 [9] was de pendent on the different host used for virus growth or the virus purification method. Fi nally, it can be concluded that the 65-kD structural protein observed under reducing conditions in polyacrylamide gels of purified MHV-S [6,12; PJT, unpubl. data] apparently is not a viral hemagglutinin.",
