This viral outbreak has raised serious concerns among the public and patients with health conditions. In the medical community, Rheumatologists are particularly concerned because their patients represent a population of autoimmune rheumatic disorders who are mostly on immunosuppressive agents and are susceptible to infection. While much has been learnt on COVID-19 in general, little is known of COVID-19 severity and outcomes in patients with rheumatic diseases (RD). Herein, in conjunction with the literature review, we report a case series of patients with RD, who were infected with COVID-19",

In our patients, a diagnosis of COVID-19 was made based on clinical grounds and by polymerase chain reaction of samples from nasopharyngeal swabs. In addition, a literature search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases was conducted between December 2019 and May 2, 2020 using the terms: \"COVID-19\" and \"rheumatic disease\" or \"biologic\". The search process and result are depicted in PRISMA (Figure 1 ). English language articles that reported single case or case series of COVID-19 in RD were reviewed. Relevant information COVID-19 and rheumatic disease 4 such as demographic, clinical, therapeutic data, and outcomes of these patients were gathered from the literature.

All 4 patients had elevated acute phase reactants, 2 patients had mild COVID-19 with lymphopenia, and 2 patients had severe infection with normal lymphocyte counts and high levels of interleukin (IL)-6. None of the patients exhibited an exacerbation of their underlying RDs. The lupus patient had normal complement levels and negative anti-double stranded DNA antibodies.

            "text": "CoV2 is an enveloped RNA virus that consists of four primary structural proteins including a spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) glycoprotein, membrane (M)glycoprotein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein, along with several accessory proteins(11).The S glycoprotein binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor on cell membranes, followed by fusion of the viral membrane and host cell(12,13). The cellular serine protease, TMPRSS2, is also required to properly process the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and facilitate host cell entry(14). The virus entry initially triggers the innate immuneresponse, where Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRR) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMP). The PAMP may be nucleic acids, glycoproteins, lipoproteins and other small molecules that are found in the structural components of viruses. This in turn induces a release of proinflammatory cytokines, which activate transcription factors and JAK-STAT pathways, further releasing a number of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b1, TNF\u03b1, other activates the adaptive immune response, where activated Th1 cells can stimulate cytotoxic CD8 + T cells to destroy virally infected cells. Meanwhile, Th1 cells activate and stimulate B cells to produce antigen-specific antibodies(16, 17). Despite this defense mechanism, like the 2002 SARS-CoV, these viruses have the ability to evade the immune system (18, 19), thus making the development of effective drugs more challenging. It is reported that a subgroup of COVID-19 patients(15%) developed severe infection and life-threatening complications, in which hyperinflammatory responses or cytokine storm are involved (20). Cytokine storm is defined as a syndrome of excessive immune activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes and macrophages with hypersecretion of proinflammatory cytokines. These mediators include interleukin IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, and TNF\u03b1(21-23). Huang et al. described a similar cytokine profile in their patients with COVID-19 and cytokine storm (24). Th17 cells and IL-17 are also involved in the cytokine storm response (25). With what has been learned on the role of cytokine storm, it will be important to use that information to guide and formulate a therapeutic strategy for severe COVID-19 patients. Henderson et. al recently suggested to monitor COVID-19 patients as early as possible with such biometrics as cytopenia, fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase, hepatic transaminases, elevated ferritin, CD25, and IL-6 for cytokine storm. They also summarized treatment regimens for cytokine storm in general and their potential utility in severe COVID-19(26). Among them are IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 inhibitors which have been successfully used in alleviating cytokine storm secondary to certain systemic inflammatory RDs(27-30). Tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, has been studied in COVID-19 patients with some success. A study of severe to critical COVID-19 patients in China has shown improved outcome in 15 out of 20 patients(31). Preliminary data from a French study also has provided promising results(32), An Italian prospective open, single-arm, multicenter study of 63 hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 has demonstrated improvement in respiratory and laboratory parameters(33). According to the literature data in our study, two RD patients on tocilizumab developed mild COVID-19 infection, supporting the positive role of IL-6 antagonist. There are still several ongoing clinical trials to investigate the potential role of interleukin antagonists, particularly IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, in the treatment of severe COVID-19 (34-40). JAK inhibitors which indirectly block IL-6 are also being studied in treating this infection (41-44). For a full consideration of using anticytokine storm to treat this viral disease, other agents to inhibit the inflammatory mediators may need to be explored. Therefore, it is worthwhile to investigate whether other biologics may have influences in the clinical course of the COVID-19 related respiratory and other complications. In the present study, our RA patient on etanercept developed mild COVID-19 without complications. Similarly, in the published studies 7 cases were on etanercept and developed mild symptoms, although some patients were hospitalized. Etanercept is a TNF\u03b1 receptor II antagonist which is known to be associated with a high rate of infections. Unexpectedly, it did not lead to severe COVID-19 in our patient and literature cases, perhaps due to its inhibition of TNF\u03b1, a cytokine involved in the viral disease cytokine storm. According to the literature data in our study, TNF\u03b1 inhibitors including etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab were more frequently used in RD patients, and they seemed to have less severity of the viral illness. TNF\u03b1 has been reported to be present in the blood and disease tissues of patients with COVID-19(45). Additionally, it is possible that pretreatment with etanercept could have resulted in a blunted IL-6 response indirectly. In an in vitro study, IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 were upregulated by the recombinant S protein of the 2002 SARS-CoV suggesting that TNF\u03b1 or IL-6",

She had been on etanercept 50 mg weekly and methotrexate (MTX) 10 mg weekly for more than 10 years. Additional comorbidities and medications are outlined inTable 1. Laboratory values including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, IL-6, and lung imaging studies were normal. A nasopharyngeal swab obtained on admission was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Viracor Eurofins, Lee's Summit, Mo.). Her viral symptoms quickly abated without special treatment. She did not receive methotrexate or etanercept during the hospitalization.A 78-year-old Caucasian man presented to our hospital with high fevers (38.9\u00ba C) and severe dry cough for the previous 24 hours, along with fatigue, myalgias, shortness of breath, frontal headaches, and lightheadedness, in March 2020. His medical history was significant for AS, for which he received secukinumab 150 mg subcutaneous every four weeks for the previous 16 months. Other information such as comorbidities and medications are outlined inTable 1. On admission, his vital signs were temperature 38.2\u00b0 C, respiration rate 22 breaths/minute, and blood pressure 179/78 mmHg, with pulse oximeter 98% on room air. The physical exam was within normal limits otherwise. His relevant laboratory findings are listed(Table 1). Despite initial normal chest X-ray, a chest CT performed on admission day 2 showed several small areas of groundglass opacities. On day 4, he had elevated inflammatory markers and worsening respiratory status requiring mechanical ventilation. He completed a five-day course of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Secukinumab was not administered during the hospitalization. The patient remained intubated with mechanical ventilation.",

There were 2 cases of RD on rituximab, 1 with GPA having severe COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation; the patient received HCQ and lopinavir/ritonavir. The other patient with RA had clinical improvement after receiving HCQ/azithromycin/lopinavir-ritonavir/tocilizumab, and supplemental oxygen. There were 2 tocilizumab users including 1 Systemic Sclerosis patient who was treated at home and 1 RA patient on MTX and HCQ requiring supplemental oxygen, who was discharged 6 days later. Of the 6 secukinumab users, 5 were treated at home, while 1 required hospitalization but was discharged 3 days later. Among the 17 SLE cases, there were 7 ICU admissions and 2 deaths. All patients were on HCQ and 7 were on immunosuppressive agents. The authors did not specify the medications used among those ICU or severe patients(7). In the Global Rheumatology Alliance registry of 110 cases, there were 19 SLE cases; however, their disease severity and DMARD use was not specified. In addition, there were 39 hospitalized patients and 9 deaths(9). In the New York University Langone Health group study of 59 confirmed cases of COVID-19, there were 45 outpatients and 14 inpatients. Of the hospitalized patients, there were 1 ICU patient who had hypertension, BMI >30, mild psoriatic arthritis, and was on MTX prior to infection and 1 death who had coronary artery disease, BMI>40, and severe psoriasis. The remaining patients had mild viral disease course. Based on the total number of the literature cases plus our 4 cases, we estimated the mortality was 5.9% (12/201) among COVID-19 patients with RD.During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, both healthy individuals and patients with chronic conditions can be infected. We present a cases series of patients with RD, who developed COVID-19. Both our case study and the literature data indicate that patients with Our analysis of these 4 cases has indicated that different DMARDs may affect the COVID-19 course and prognosis differently. To explain the potential effects of various DMARDs, we will first discuss the immunologic mechanisms of COVID-19.",
