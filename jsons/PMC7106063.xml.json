Today this concept is very relevant because of the intercontinental transport and economic interchange between distant regions (in a biogeographic sense) and, therefore, we can consider the Earth as a global home for most pathogens and infectious diseases. This global pool of parasite species is organized at a regional level in diverse metacommunities, which are distributed in large biogeographic regions as continents or subcontinents. At a local level, parasite communities are reorganized because of the existence of several \u201cfilters\u201d (e.g., historic, cultural, environmental) that affect the dispersion of parasites. They, finally, constitute an infracommunity in each host individual, which includes all infrapopulations harbored by this specific host.",

Then, an important consequence arises: each species' genome is expressed within the context of the other species' phenotype. The concept of the \u201cextended phenotype\u201d15 emphasizes that phenotypes of hosts and parasites result from interactions between the 2 genomes. However, it is also important to consider that host and parasite genotypes share control of the epidemiologic parameters of their relationship.16\n",

            "text": "The interaction between the host and the parasite is characterized by its asymmetry.2 The host may reach its maximum fitness without the parasite, whereas the parasite without the host has no fitness at all. The fitness of a parasitized host is determined by various factors (e.g., availability of resources, competition). The resulting parasite-induced loss of host fitness (because of the damage caused and the competition for part of the resources used by the host) is defined as virulence,17 which does not mean the same as pathogenicity. The life of the parasite is not of interest to the host, but the host's life is of interest to the parasite because the former is used as a habitat and as a vehicle. This second asymmetry has been used to define the concept of the cost of virulence. As a component of the parasite's fitness, virulence may also be used as a measure or index of the parasite survival within the host.18 Parasite fitness is determined by the success of its transmission to new hosts. Therefore, the decrease of host fitness induces a concomitant decrease in parasite fitness, which needs to balance the costs and benefits associated with its virulence. The resulting self-limitation of virulence leads to the concept of optimal virulence. Host resistance has also been defined as virulence against the parasite, or host-mediated loss of fitness in the parasite, resulting in changes in its fecundity, density, and/or mortality.2 The cost of resistance is expressed in terms of metabolic expense for the host and can vary throughout the host's lifespan.19\n",

Conventional diagnostic methods have limitations that reflect a limited knowledge of epidemiology, ecology, and biology of many parasitic diseases of exotic pets.55 Polymerase chain reaction\u2013based techniques have become simple, fast, and reliable and are available at most veterinary diagnostic laboratories. These techniques allow the detection of the DNA of different parasites from various tissue samples or biologic samples and, further, its characterization of the organism to a specific level.55, 56 Importantly, the versatility of these molecular methods is such that it permits a search for genetic diversity at infraspecific level and to infer phylogenetic relationships between different parasites, even at a supraspecific level. This work needs to be complemented with the development of specific treatments for such parasitic diseases. Long-term monitoring of these parasite infections may help us to understand better which factors affect their epidemiology. The development of specific vaccines, both for humans and for pets, may become the keystone for preventing the spread of such diseases.57\n",
