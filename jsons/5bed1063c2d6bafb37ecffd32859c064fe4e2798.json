At the moment no reports are 27 available regarding thrombosis of prosthetic vascular grafts. We present the case of a patient with 28 COVID19-related pneumonia, who suffered from the acute thrombosis of a previously implanted 29 aortic graft. 30 Case report 31 A 67-year old male patient, undergone open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm with a 32 bifurcated graft six years before, was admitted to the Emergency Department with high fever for a 33 week without cough or dyspnea. Thoracic ultrasound showed signs of bilateral interstitial 34 pneumonia and the Sars-Cov-2 swab was positive. Antiretroviral therapy and prophylactic low 35 molecular weight heparin treatment were initiated. Due to the progressive impairment of respiratory 36 function, the patient was intubated after eight days from the admission. The day after he showed 37 signs of bilateral acute limb ischemia. A duplex ultrasound demonstrated the complete thrombosis 38 of the aortic graft without flow at the femoral level. An urgent angio-computed tomography (CT) 39 scan for revascularization purpose was requested, but the patient died upon the arrival in 40 radiological suite. 41 Conclusion 42",

For this reason, it can be suggested that 112 patients with vascular prosthesis could be considered a selected subgroup, in which, in case of 113 COVID19, it is probably necessary to start an aggressive treatment with heparin at therapeutic 114 dosage. Acute aortic thrombosis is a condition associated with high mortality. Even in our case the 115 patient, who already showed very bad general condition due to the COVID19, died. If the general ",

Since 61 then he was in treatment with 100 mg/die of acetylsalicylic acid. In January 2019 a duplex 62 ultrasound (DUS) exam had demonstrated the patency of the graft, the absence of pseudoaneurysms 63 or stenosis, and a normal flow of the femoral-popliteal-tibial axis in both legs. At the admission, the 64 abdomen was treatable, femoral and peripheral pulses normally present at both legs.

The thoracic ultrasound demonstrated moderate bilateral 67 B-lines without pleural effusion. At the thoracic RX interstitial thickenings in the medium and basal therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine was administrated. Moreover, 71 thrombotic prophylaxis with subcutaneous enoxaparin (50 IU/kg per day) was initiated. In the 72 following days the ABG values got worse, with a drop of Horowitz Index (HI) under 100 despite 73 the ventilation with reservoir. On march 25 th , due to the worsening of respiratory exchanges, the 74 patient was transferred to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). At that moment he had fever and dyspnea. 75 Blood tests showed Fibrinogen 432 mg/dL, D-Dimer 754 ng/mL, IL-6 19.6 pg/mL and PCR 107 76 mg/L. CPAP ventilation was initiated (PEEP 8-FiO2 80%), therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir and 77 hydroxychloroquine was continued, and the patient also started, in the absence of contraindications, 78 the therapeutic protocol currently used in our hospital with methylprednisolone 80 mg and 79 tocilizumab (2 doses). Respiratory exchanges got worse (HI 64) and the patient was intubated and 80 pronated immediately. On march 31 st the patient suddenly showed pallor and hypothermia of both 81 legs, with moire starting from the transverse umbilical line. Femoral and peripheral pulses were 82 absent in both legs. Blood tests showed D-dimer 104822 ng/mL, CPK 1124 U/L, myoglobin 33327 83 ng/mL, LDH 1124 U/L, IL-6 >200 pg/mL. Continuous intravenous administration of sodium 84 heparin at anticoagulant dosage (1000 IU/h) was immediately started. A bedside DUS showed the 85 patency of the suprarenal aorta and of the renal arteries and the complete thrombosis of the aortic 86 graft without detectable blood-flow at the femoral level. An angio-computed tomography (CT) scan 87 was immediately requested for an intended attempt of hybrid revascularization with bilateral 88 femoral surgical access and thrombectomy under fluoroscopic guide.
