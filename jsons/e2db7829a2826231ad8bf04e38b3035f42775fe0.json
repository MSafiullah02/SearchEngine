These metabolites include polyphenolic compounds, the six so-called catechins, and the methyl-xanthine alkaloids caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline. Postharvest inactivation of phenol oxidases in green tea leaves prevents oxidation of the catechins, whereas postharvest enzyme-catalyzed oxidation (fermentation) of catechins in tea leaves results in the formation of four theaflavins as well as polymeric thearubigins. These substances impart the black color to black teas. Black and partly fermented oolong teas contain both classes of phenolic compounds. A need exists to develop a better understanding of the roles of polyphenolic tea compounds in food and medical microbiology. This overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of activities of tea flavonoids and teas against foodborne and other pathogenic bacteria, virulent protein toxins produced by some of the bacteria, virulent bacteriophages, pathogenic viruses and fungi. Also covered are synergistic, mechanistic, and bioavailability aspects of the antimicrobial effects. Further research is suggested for each of these categories.

The literature suggests that geographical origin, soil composition, differences in the composition of different leaves, time of harvesting, postharvest treatments, and physical structure of the different leaves probably influence the composition of tea leaves. Also contributing to this variability is the susceptibility of tea compounds to extraction by different solvents [17] [18] [19] (Fig. 2) . For example, we recently reported that significantly greater quantities of individual and total flavonoids (catechins and theaflavins) were extracted with 80% ethanol/water at 608C for 15 min than with boiled water for 5 min from 77 commercial teas sold in the United States [20, 21] . The latter conditions are widely used at home to prepare tea infusions. The distribution of the individual catechins and theaflavins in individual teas extracted by the two solvents also varied. The following ranges of concentrations of flavonoids (catechins plus theaflavins) in the tea leaves extracted with 80% ethanol were observed (in mg/g): in 32 black teas, 19.8-115.1; in 24 green teas, 12.3-136.3; and in 14 specialty teas, 4.9-118.5. These results make it possible to maximize the extraction of tea compounds for antimicrobial studies and to better relate the content of flavonoids and alkaloids of teas and dietary supplements to their health-promoting effects. A striking example of the influence of environmental factors on tea composition and antimicrobial activities is the observation by Chou et al. [22] that the antibacterial activities of teas against Ba. cereus, E. coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas fluorescence, Salmonella spp. and St. aureus are influenced both by harvesting (manufacturing) season and the extent of postharvest fermentation in the following order: green tea > oolong tea > black tea. Extracts of oolong tea leaves prepared in the summer exhibited the strongest activity followed by extracts prepared in the spring, winter, or fall (Fig. 3A) .

The answer to the second question is probably \"yes\", based on the following reported observations on plasma levels of tea catechins in humans: (i) After oral consumption, a large fraction of tea flavonoids is eliminated into the feces and bile. Only a fraction of the consumed flavonoids is absorbed into the circulation from the small intestine. The low bioavailability of the flavonoids is probably due to their high molecular weights and the ability of the phenolic OH groups to form large hydration shells [125, 126] . After absorption, EGCG is largely present in plasma in the free form, whereas EGC and EC are largely present in the conjugated form. Over 90% of the total absorbed EGC and EC is excreted in the urine, mostly in the conjugated form [127] .
