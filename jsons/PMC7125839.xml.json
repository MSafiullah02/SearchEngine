This gives place to itching, tickling, or stinging sensations, followed by paroxysms of sneezing, copious flow of serum and mucus from the nostrils, suffusion of the eyes, lacrimation, flushed countenance, and possibly sensations of constriction over the eyes in the frontal sinuses and headache. The patient is put to bed and the bowels relaxed if necessary. When the temperature is high it is reduced with anti-pyrin or one of its efficient substitutes, and the pain and other distressing symptoms are relieved by the coryza tablets containing a combination of morphia, atropia, and caffeine in the proportion of one-twelfth grain of morphia with one-six hundredth grain of atropia and one-sixth grain of caffeine. The morphia relieves the pain and nervous irritability, surpresses the excessive secretions and stimulates the circulation; the atropia elevates the tone of the blood vessels, quickens the pulse, decreases all the secretions except the urine, stimulates the respiratory center and counteracts the constipating effect of the morphia; and the caffeine stimulates the nervous centers and the kidneys and diminishes the tendency of the morphia to produce nausea. The sneezing and nasal discharge cease, the nostrils open up, and the pain disappears.4\n",

After this brief contact with the outside world, the community became totally isolated for the remaining 8 months of the year. The incidence of common colds in the city of Longyear was one attack per person per year. Local history proved that epidemics of the common cold would never break out before the ships started to arrive each summer. In 1931 the first boat arriving in May had only one seaman who had symptoms suggestive of the incubating stage of a fresh common cold. Two men on the ship's crew had recovered from a recent attack of a cold in the week before arriving. Forty-eight hours after the arrival of the boat three cases of common cold developed in the town. There had been no common colds in the 3 months preceding the arrival of the first boat. By the fourth day after arrival there were 12 new cases of common colds seen in the dispensary and that same pattern continued through the tenth day, at which the number of cases peaked at 26 and then tapered off during the following 3 weeks.",

He reported that the virus in some experimental colds was present not only in the nasal discharge of the patient with a fully developed cold but also in nasal washings obtained during the incubation period. The most successful means of viral spread is transmission of infectious mucous secretions to the fingers and hands and subsequently to the nose or eyes of a susceptible recipient. This finding has been reported in numerous studies during the past 20 years.63 Most respiratory viruses produce reinfection after re-exposure. Subsequent infections with the same or similar agents are generally more mild and last shorter periods.56 Risks factors for increased rates of infections and increased severity of disease include young age, low birth weight, prematurity, chronic disease, congenital immunodeficiency disorders, malnutrition, crowding, the presence of large numbers of susceptible people in the community, and exposure of the child to other infected persons. Rhinoviral infections are spread from person to person by virus-contaminated respiratory secretions. Possible routes for spread are inhalation of small airborne particles, inhalation or impaction of large particles transmitted over a short distance, and contact directly or indirectly via contaminated environmental objects. Although all three routes probably are involved to some extent, the most likely is direct contact.24 In a series of studies with experimental infections Gwaltney and Hendley26 showed the feasibility of contact transmission. Persons with high concentration of virus in their respiratory secretions exhibited a propensity for contamination of their hands and environmental objects with the virus. Rhinovirus was recovered from 40% to 90% of hands of persons with colds and from 6% to 15% of environmental objects such as doorknobs and coffee cups. Rhinoviruses were shown to exhibit good survival on many environmental surfaces for hours, and infections were transmitted readily by finger contact with a contaminated object and then back to the eye or nasal mucosa.25\n",

Pathologic changes during the development of a common cold begin with edema of the submucosal layers. The first change to appear in the epithelium is separation of the cells by edema fluid. The surface cells loosen and begin to slough off. A necrotic zone then develops next to the surface cells. This may extend deeper into the submucosal layer. The entire epithelium finally disintegrates. Later in the disease the cells begin to regenerate, starting with those nearest the basement membrane and then gradually replacing cells layer by layer.31 Bardin et al2 reported much later on several studies of the histologic appearance of nasal mucosa infected by rhinoviruses and other respiratory viruses. They found considerably less evidence of serious epithelial disruption caused by the rhinoviruses. Influenza viruses, adenoviruses, and parainfluenza viruses tended to have the more severe cytopathic effects on the respiratory epithelium.",

He also showed increased numbers of lymphocytes in nasal secretions during rhinoviral infections. It is possible that the decrease in circulating T lymphocytes may be related to increased levels of interferon. Lymphocytes release cytokines that are involved intimately in the inflammatory process. The production of cytokines by viruses and T lymphocytes may be one of the major influences on airway inflammation. In elegant studies by Hsia, human peripheral blood cells were incubated with rhinovirus. The cellular immune response was evaluated by measuring the production of interleukin-2. Interleukin-2 increased by a factor of four and was related inversely to the duration of virus shedding but was unrelated to total symptom scores and to convalescent antibody titers. Interleukin-2 may play a major role in the duration of viral shedding, and further studies may implicate cytokines produced by lymphocytic activation.",

The treatment and prevention of respiratory viral infections have been the focus of interest since the early 1940s when influenza vaccines were developed.

Interferon inducers such as propane diamine and enviroxime showed great promise in studies of tissue culture and are apparently nontoxic but have no in vivo effect.14 One additional approach to preventing the common cold is by enhancing the individual's immunity using immunomodulators. Of these drugs, muramyl dipetide and a thioguanosine derivative have shown great promise when administered to mice and guinea pigs.

When Naclerio53 challenged volunteers with rhinovirus, the infected group produced large quantities of nasopharyngeal mucus with relatively low levels of histamine and albumin but very high levels of kinins, including bradykinin and lysyl bradykinin. The kinins have been shown to induce symptoms of nasal irritation and rhinorrhea, symptoms similar to those produced by histamines. Kinins are not affected by antihistamine drugs. Consequently, antikinin drugs are being developed. One such candidate, NPC567, a bradykinin antagonist, has been tested but has been unsuccessful in reducing nasal irritation and rhinorrhea.",

Smith and Feldman61 found no evidence of effectiveness of over-the-counter cold medications in preschool children but did find them useful in reducing cold symptoms in adolescents and adults. They also found that when applied by nasal spray or taken orally, most decongestants had a positive effect on reducing nasal stuffiness and some seemed to reduce rhinorrhea by way of vasoconstriction of the nasopharyngeal mucosa. Because of rebound congestion on withdrawal of decongestants (leading to addiction) and adverse effects on hypertensive patients, these drugs should be used with great caution and only for the most brief period.",

The large number of serotypes of rhinovirus plus other respiratory viruses make vaccine development difficult. A major problem with developing a vaccine to the cold viruses is that durable immunity to the respiratory viral infections is difficult to produce. Parenteral immunization does not produce much nasal secretion of antibodies and provides little or no protection against a challenging virus. Even with influenza vaccine it is known that the immunity, although high initially, is lost after only 3 or 4 months.",

Mandell47 reasoned that because elevated body temperature is a nearly universal manifestation of infection, perhaps the increased body temperature affects phagocytosis of bacteria or viruses. Carmichael et al10 inoculated puppies with canine herpes virus. Most puppies survived the almost universally fatal infection when they were kept at elevated temperatures for several days after the inoculation. Reducing fever with antipyretics may be a counterproductive effort. Treatment with aspirin might be useful in preventing infection by cold viruses, but aspirin, acetaminophen, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents actually can be shown to increase the duration of viral shedding.62\n",
