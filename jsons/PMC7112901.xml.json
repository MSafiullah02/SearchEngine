            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive single-stranded RNA viruses. They belong to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh, 1997). CoVs have the largest known nonsegmented viral RNA genome, 27\u201332 kb in length and is composed in its 5\u2032-proximal two-thirds of two large open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, encoding the replicase complex (Brian and Baric, 2005). The CoV family traditionally is subdivided into three groups based on serological and genetic properties (Cavanagh et al., 1993, Siddell et al., 1983). Groups 1 and 2 infect a large range of mammalian species whereas group 3 is restricted to birds (Saif, 2004). Classification of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in group 2 or as the prototype of a new group 4 is subject to controversy and is complicated by the seeming recombinant origin of its genome (Gorbalenya et al., 2004, Rest and Mindell, 2003, Snijder et al., 2003, Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004). The situation recently became more complicated because bats were found to harbour a wide range of mammalian CoVs (Li et al., 2005, Poon et al., 2005). It is thus likely that bats serve as reservoirs for CoVs in a similar manner as anseriform birds do for influenza A (Webster et al., 1992). CoVs are responsible for a broad spectrum of diseases, including respiratory and enteric pathologies, both in humans and in animals (Saif, 2004). Human CoVs (HCoVs) cause respiratory tract illnesses. However, there is also direct evidence for involvement in enteric (e.g. strain HECoV 4408) (Zhang et al., 1994, Zhu et al., 2006) and suggestive evidence for involvement in neurological disease (Clarke et al., 1979, Flewett et al., 1987, Foley and Leutenegger, 2001, Gerna et al., 1985, Gerna et al., 1984, Han et al., 2006, Jacomy et al., 2006, Luby et al., 1999, Resta et al., 1985, Saif, 2004, Schnagl et al., 1990, Schnagl et al., 1986, Sitbon, 1985, Vabret et al., 2006, Wang et al., 2007, Zhu et al., 2006). HCoV are frequent causes of the common cold; usually a self-limiting upper respiratory tract (URT) illness (Heikkinen and Jarvinen, 2003). The prototypic HCoVs, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, were identified in the 1960s (Hamre and Procknow, 1966, Vabret et al., 2001). They are members of groups 1 and 2, respectively. Infection with these viruses is thought to be responsible for \u224830% of common cold cases (Fields et al., 2001). Until the discovery of the SARS-CoV, CoVs received relatively little attention as human pathogens beyond their causal role in the common cold. The most recently discovered HCoVs, the SARS-CoV (Peiris et al., 2003), HCoV-NL63 (van der Hoek et al., 2006) and CoV HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005) causes severe respiratory tract infection. Additionally, the knowledge of the pathogenesis of CoVs in wildlife species is also limited. Among the many and highly diverse CoVs found in bats (see above), SARS-like CoVs were identified in horseshoe bats of the genus rhinolophus. Virological and serological studies indicated that masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) were infected with SARS-CoV or a closely related virus (Wang and Eaton, 2007). SARS-CoV thus may have spilled into civets from bats, and then emerged into humans. However, the lack of genomic sequences for many animal CoVs impeded clarification of the origin of SARS-CoV. Sequencing analysis of SARS-CoV revealed that the 5\u2032 end, containing the polymerase gene, is of mammalian origin, and the structural genes (excluding spike glycoprotein) at the 3\u2032 end are of avian origin (Jackwood, 2006). With some exceptions (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2007, Spackman and Cameron, 1983, Spackman et al., 2005, Swayne et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2009), the spread of CoVs among birds is not well known (Cavanagh, 2005, Jonassen et al., 2005). Even though the number of known CoVs in birds is relatively small in comparison to the number in bats, like in bats, birds contain a wide diversity of CoVs. While this report was being prepared, three novel CoVs, classified as CoV group 3c, were identified in three different bird families, bulbul CoV HKU11, thrush CoV HKU11 and munia CoV HKU13 (BuCoV HKU11, ThCoV HKU12, MuCoV HKU13) (Woo et al., 2009). New diagnostic methods, which are able to detect a wide range of CoVs in various species and which can support the better understanding of CoV evolution, host range and reservoir conditions, are needed.",

The clinical relevance of serological methods, mainly based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, is limited, since they are generally time-consuming. A variety of assays for detection of CoV have been developed to obtain more sensitive and rapid diagnostic results, such as reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) (Vabret et al., 2001), nested RT-PCR (Myint et al., 1994) and, recently, also real-time RT-PCR (van Elden et al., 2004). For simplicity, real-time RT-PCR is in the following referred to as \u201cQPCR\u201d. QPCR is less time-consuming than nested or unnested RT-PCR methods, because the amplification and analysis are completed in a closed system, reducing contamination risks.",

            "text": "Although molecular techniques enable the detection of species or groups of CoVs, there are few reports of pan-CoV RT-PCRs (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Moes et al., 2005, Stephensen et al., 1999), especially those that have been adapted to a real-time format (Escutenaire et al., 2007). All methods are based on amplification of fragments from the replicase gene, which has a highly conserved structure and function. This region is suitable for design of primers allowing a broad-spectrum detection of genetically distant CoVs. The SYBRgreen method (Escutenaire et al., 2007) is both sensitive and specific according to our experience. The specificity is ascertained by a melting curve analysis, which in many cases can discriminate a true positive from a false signal (Escutenaire et al., 2007). However, a weakly positive true signal may occasionally be obscured by a stronger false one. Thus, SYBRgreen techniques to some degree lack the increased specificity provided by TaqMan\u00ae nuclease-based systems (Bustin, 2004). We therefore set out to develop a broadly targeted TaqMan\u00ae detection method system for Coronaviridae using a set of degenerate primers previously developed and reported by us (Escutenaire et al., 2007) for the generic detection of CoVs. The availability of an alternative hybridization-based assay is useful for verification of results based on the previous method. The greater specificity may also facilitate the interpretation of weak hybridization signals, which might be overlooked in the SYBRgreen technique. An optimised mixture of three probes, giving a signal arising from the best binding probes, was necessary to cover most of the known variation within the target stretch of Coronaviridae. They target discrete, short, conserved domains in coronaviral subsets. Their use avoided the extensive degeneration necessary with only one probe. LNA (locked nucleic acid) was used to increase the melting temperature of the relatively short probes. This enhances their affinity to the consensus target sequences. A somewhat similar approach has been used by others (Yip et al., 2005), but without the broad, virus family-specific, targeting and the increased specificity provided by the nuclease-based probe detection of the present method.",

A in non-degenerated probe (5-[FAM]TATTATCAAAATAATGTCTTTATG[TAMRA]-3) was first synthesized. Not unexpectedly, it did not detect all CoV strains. A degenerated probe 5\u2032-[FAM]TAYTAYCARAAYRRYGTBTTYATG[TAMRA]-3\u2032, encompassing the whole variation, was then synthesized, with a degeneracy of 768. In our experience, probes with a high degeneracy give very low signals. In order to bring down the degeneracy per probe, three probes were designed. The probes were derived from three CoV groups, as described in Section 2. Probe_I and probe_III were overlapping. The probes had a degeneracy of 8, 8 and 6, respectively, and LNA nucleotides were introduced in order to increase the T\nm of two of the probes, to achieve approximately same T\nm for all three probes. When they were tested singly, they gave high relative signal strength, around 0.5, and detected most, but not all (TGEV, FCoV type I, IBV, CCoV type I, PRCoV, SARS, CoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, BcoV11 and BcoV22), coronaviral strains. However, a NQPCR with a 1 + 1 + 1 mixture with 200 nM of each FAM-labeled probes_I, II and III gave somewhat lower signal strength (0.3), but detected all coronaviral strains. However, when the three probes were labeled with separate fluorophores, signal strengths varied from 0.25 up to 1. This probe mixture was predicted to bind to most, possibly all, known CoV strains (Fig. 1a and b) and was used in the further experiments. A varying pattern of predicted binding was obtained when reference and divergent target CoV sequences were tested in VOMP. No strain came out completely negative in the analysis (Fig. 1b). The predicted hybridization values were largely corroborated when strains were tested experimentally (Fig. 1c).",

Two of the CoV positive pools (one of the spring and one of the autumn pools) were also positive by SYBRgreen QPCR, but five of the seven CoV positive pools were missed by the SYBRgreen QPCR. The PCR products of the seven CoV positive samples were sequenced (from both forward and reverse strands). The sequencing of one pool came out incomplete. All six fully sequenced amplicons were aligned with reference sequences. They resembled the peafowl CoV, accession number AY641576 and avian infectious bronchitis virus, accession number NC_001451, with sequence identities ranging from 83 to 85% and 84 to 86% (Suppl. Info, Fig. S1b). The sequences clustered together, indicating the existence of new CoVs in ducks. The seventh, incompletely sequenced, sample yielded a similar sequence. A caveat is the conserved nature of the targeted stretch. It is not suitable for fine discrimination of coronaviral strains. The major groups do however cluster approximately as expected. Neighbour joining bootstrap consensus (Fig. 2) and minimum evolution, bootstrap consensus and maximum parsimony, bootstrap consensus (Suppl. Info, Fig. S2a and b) trees were created from the alignment. The branching pattern was almost identical in all three trees. However, further sequencing of longer stretches is necessary to establish the duck corona sequences as \u201cnew\u201d avian coronaviruses, cf. (Woo et al., 2009). Sequencing of a longer stretch (559 nt without primer sequences, which include the stretch used by Woo et al. (2009) of the polymerase gene of one of the isolates was performed (Mallard_Ottenby_Spring 13). A comparison of the percent identity of Mallard_Ottenby_Spring 13 nucleotide sequence with published sequences of IBV strains and other CoVs is presented in Suppl. Info, Fig. S3. The similarity matrix revealed a percentage identity of Mallard_Ottenby_Spring 13 to IBV strains ranging from 72 to 74%. The IBV strains possess a nucleotide identity of 88 to 92% within the group 3 (IBV proper) of CoVs, and nucleotide identity 60% to other CoVs. This implies that the Mallard_Ottenby_Spring 13 is an IBV-like sequence which is relatively dissimilar from established IBV strains. A more comprehensive analysis will be given in a forthcoming manuscript.",

The histone 3.3 PCR was run with (+rt) and without (\u2212rt) the presence of reverse transcriptase. The \u2212rt results signify the presence of eukaryotic (presumably from duck) DNA, whereas the difference between +rt and \u2212rt results signifies the presence of eukaryotic RNA. The \u2212rt reaction frequently came out negative, while the +rt reaction was positive in most samples. This means that histone 3.3 RNA was more abundant than histone 3.3 DNA, which is logical. RNA often occurs in great excess over DNA in eukaryotic cells. The means and standard deviation (mean \u00b1 S.D.) of the C\nt-value of histone 3.3 PCRs were calculated. The 28 CoV negative, histone 3.3 RNA positive samples yielded an average C\nt-value of 37.5 \u00b1 1.6, whereas the seven CoV positive and histone 3.3 RNA positive samples yielded an average C\nt-value of 37.2 \u00b1 0.5. Student's t-test did not detect significantly deviating histone 3.3 +rt and \u2212rt C\nt values between CoV positive and CoV negative samples (p-value = 0.758). Moreover, one of seven CoV positive samples, and four of 28 CoV negative samples were histone 3.3 +rt negative. The difference between 1/7 vs. 4/28 is not significant (Fisher's exact test; 2-tailed; p-value = 1). Thus, there were approximately equal amounts of eukaryotic RNA in the CoV positive and CoV negative duck fecal samples, making it unlikely that the CoV negativity of some samples was due to RNA degradation.",

In developing the NQPCR assay, a standard non-touchdown PCR assay was first used. However, to further increase the sensitivity for aberrant targets a touchdown procedure was designed and assessed side by side with the non-touchdown PCR, by amplifying cDNA synthesized from RNA extracted from 10 CoV strains; CCoV, PRCoV, HCoV-229E, IBV 297, FCoV, TGEV, BCoV-22, HCoV-229E, SARS, IBV, BCoV-11, and HCoV-NL63 (Bustin, 2004, Mohamed et al., 2006). The amplification efficiency was increased with the touch down procedure compared to the non-touchdown procedure. Non-touchdown had an efficiency of 70% (R\n2 0.99) while touchdown gave an efficiency of 90% (R\n2 0.99).

            "text": "CoV came into the searchlight when the SARS pandemic occurred in 2003. The intense researched spurred then has revealed an unexpected variety of CoV in various host species. However, many questions are still unanswered in CoV biology, including important aspects of viral evolution, subpopulations, hosts, variation in pathogenicity and tissue tropism and regarding reservoirs, which are important in viral \u201csurvival\u201d and transmission in nature. Bats are now recognised as reservoirs of a broad range of mammalian CoVs (Poon et al., 2005, Wang and Eaton, 2007). Recently, several findings of CoV in wild birds have been reported (Barr et al., 1988, Jonassen et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2005). The results of this report extend these observations. They indicate that birds, another flying vertebrate, can act as reservoirs for avian CoVs. Considering the many unanswered questions regarding this and other aspects of coronaviral epidemiology, there is a need for novel methods, which are broadly detecting the various CoV variants in different hosts and which are also sensitive, simple and specific. Setting up a generic PCR requires an extensive analysis of variability, a time-consuming evaluation of candidate degenerate primers and probes, and a comprehensive collection of samples. In this study, a one-step real-time RT-PCR, was developed targeting a conserved region of the CoV ORF1b used previously in a SYBRgreen QPCR (Escutenaire et al., 2007). The Consort\u00a9 program (Blomberg et al., to be published) was used. The new technique was based on nuclease probe degradation (TaqMan\u00ae) chemistry, degenerate primers and a low annealing temperature. The assay enabled detection of 22 CoV reference strains, covering a large portion of Coronaviridae (Table 1). The coverage of the new bat CoVs is demonstrated by using synthetic target sequences of three most deviating HKU-CoV: HKU3-CoV, HKU5-CoV and HKU9-CoV) (Fig. 1c). They were all detected by the probe combination.",

A nondegenerate probe based on the consensus of the intervening sequence between the primers was first synthesized. It did not detect all coronaviral strains. A degenerate probe encompassing the whole variation, with a degeneracy of 768, was then tested. Not unexpectedly, it gave a very low signal. In our experience (contrary to primers which can work even with a degeneracy of over 100) probes with degeneracy above 10 rarely give sufficient signal strength. In order to bring the number of variants down, the CoV target variation was analysed. It was found possible to spread it onto three overlapping TaqMan\u00ae QPCR probes of much lower degeneracy, having 8, 8 and 6 variants each. LNA residues were integrated in two of the probes (Mohrle et al., 2005, Nielsen et al., 2004), to enhance the T\nm. The introduction of LNA allowed shortening of them, to focus on a short, relatively conserved, stretch (probe_I: 27 nt, 8 LNA, probe_III: 17 nt, 6 LNA). Probe_II could be 28 nt long despite a low degeneracy. As demonstrated here, the probe mixture had a remarkable tolerance to mismatches. The free energy for hybridization was predicted using Visual OMP\u2122. It demonstrated that hybridization between the three probes and a broad range of CoV targets was likely. This was further verified by experimental data that agreed with the result obtained using the Visual OMP\u2122 (Fig. 1b and c). Interestingly, competition between the probes was not an appreciable problem. Although several of the probes sometimes gave a signal, the pattern of positivity indicated which group of CoV that gave rise to the signal. The mismatch tolerance was tested by synthetic target sequences with different degree of mismatch to the probes. Signals from synthetic DNA targets with 1, 2 and 5 mismatches were easily detectable (data not shown). The probes were tested both with the same fluorophore (FAM), and with separate fluorophores. The sensitivity was the same for these alternatives. Although based on a short stretch in the conserved RNA polymerase gene, the latter alternative provided a preliminary identification of the CoV.",

It is acknowledged that the efficiency calculation from the slope of a calibration curve often overestimates the PCR efficiency. We therefore determined the amplification efficiency of the NQPCR both for a 10-fold serial dilution of synthetic target and a 10-fold serial dilution of BCoV RNA samples with an unknown concentration down to negativity. Both standard curves displayed a linear relationship for NQPCR, with a correlation coefficient (R\n2) of 0.99 and efficiency of 93%, and an R\n2 of 0.99 and efficiency of 83%, for the synthetic and natural, imperfectly fitting (BCoV), targets, respectively. This calls for caution regarding quantitative interpretation of C\nt values. Differences in efficiency of the PCR could also be due to the fact that RNA-to-cDNA conversion is dependent on template abundance. The possibility that mishandling of samples (RNA losses; pre-receipt errors) and PCR inhibition (post-receipt errors) contributed significantly to the results reported here was made unlikely by two control experiments. Signals from RNA of a highly conserved host housekeeping gene (histone 3.3) were the same in CoV positive and CoV negative duck samples. This is a novel application of a control PCR which was earlier developed in the group (Andersson et al., 2005, Forsman et al., 2005, Muradrasoli et al., 2006). The difference between +rt and \u2212rt signal levels from duck fecal samples were relatively even, indicating a rather constant admixture of eukaryotic RNA in them.",

The pan-CoV SYBRgreen QPCR missed five duck samples that the NQPCR detected, since the cutoff (threshold) was set higher because of primer dimer signal. Primer dimers do not give a signal in a nuclease and probe-based (TaqMan\u00ae) technique like NQPCR. The NQPCR results from the human nasopharyngeal samples were concordant with those of the pan-CoV SYBRgreen QPCR technique used as a control. The 8 NQPCR CoV positive samples were negative in the respiratory virus IFA, and in a nested influenza A + B PCR (data courtesy of dr Bj\u00f6rn Herrmann), both of which do not detect CoVs. The method thus should be suitable for diagnostic purposes.",

Another generic coronaviral PCR was recently published (Vijgen et al., 2008). Furthermore, (Sampath et al., 2005) reported a recently a broad-range PCR targeting the same conserved region of the ORF1b followed by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry and base composition analysis for viral identification. Viral diagnostic techniques are undergoing a transition. Immunoassays are still valid for some purposes, but real-time PCR and microarray techniques are becoming more important. The technique presented above is simple, sensitive and is able to detect a wide variety of CoV. The extension of the assay by using three different fluorophores, with one for each of them, is a valuable modification. As expected from the alignment and predicted \u0394G values, probe 3 was primarily active in positive avian (IBV-like) samples while probe 2 was positive in a SARS sample (data not shown). Although not studied, probe 3 should primarily detect CoV groups 1 and 2.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing such a strategy to reduce probe degeneracy while maintaining a broad sequence targeting. It should have a wide applicability. High sensitivity was indicated by titrations of a CoV consensus synthetic target DNA content and viral cDNA. The new NQPCR assay, positive with 22 highly diverse strains of CoV, is a useful tool for demonstrating the role of human and wild bird CoVs in infections of the respiratory and digestive tract. This NQPCR thus proved its suitability also for the discovery of new, or so far unknown variants of CoVs.",

Variable positions have no background. The three probe sequences with IUPAC ambiguity codes are shown at the bottom, LNA positions are underlined. (b) Predicted hybridization of amplimer stretches from a broad range of coronaviruses to the three probes. An amplimer sequence from the Ottenby duck samples, with an IBV-like sequence (Ottenby 67433, obtained from a mallard. It was not mentioned in Section 2. It was however identical to the Ottenby spring 3 sample in 120 of 130 positions) was used as query in a BLAST search for similar nucleotide sequences in GenBank. The figure lists the BLAST hits in order of decreasing similarity to the query. The stretches corresponding to the query found by the BLAST search were subjected to analysis with the Visual OMP (VOMP) software, which can predict the degree of interaction (shown as an absolute \u0394G value) of an oligonucleotide with another. VOMP automatically removes all identical sequences, which meant that some reference sequences were removed from the hit list. For example, the OC43 sequence was removed. It was identical to the human enteric CoV sequence. Remaining reference sequences are shown in bold. All variants of each of the three probes were tested against all BLAST hit sequences. For each probe, the average absolute \u0394G of the three variants predicted to hybridize best to the respective target sequences is shown. The three lines depict the predicted binding of probe_I (229E-derived; dark blue), probe_II (SARS-derived; red) and probe_III (NL63-derived, yellow), respectively. The columns show the average of the predicted probe absolute \u0394G values, to indicate whether the triple-probe system would be able to detect that target sequence. (c) Differential fluorescence signal obtained with the three separately labeled probes. CoV, either RNA from reference strains, or synthetic target oligonucleotides from published CoV strains, were run in NQPCR. Results were colour coded as in (b).
