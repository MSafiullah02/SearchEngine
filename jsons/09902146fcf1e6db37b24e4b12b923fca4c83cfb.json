To that effect, we have employed the susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered model, refined by contact tracing and hospitalization data from Indian provinces Kerala, Delhi, Maharashtra, and West Bengal, as well as from overall India. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the most crucial input parameters, and we have calibrated the model to describe the data as best as possible. Short-term predictions reveal an increasing and worrying trend of COVID-19 cases for all four provinces and India as a whole, while long-term predictions also reveal the possibility of oscillatory dynamics.",

R 0 designates the number of secondary infections infected by one infected individual in a whole susceptible class, or more specifically the area under epidemic curve. For R 0 < 1, the disease is expected to stop spreading, but for R 0 = 1 an infected individual can infect on an average 1 person, that is, the spread of the disease is stable. The disease can spread and become epidemic if R 0 must be greater than 1. R 0 can help us to understand the effectiveness of the disease, that is, under what condition the disease can stop or spread ?

Moreover, the other aspects, such as vaccination, huge news coverage, educational campaigns and rapid information flow can create great psychological effects on the population, and thus remarkably change the publics' behavior and affect the implementation of individuals' intervention and control strategies [26] . It is mainly the awareness program due to media which make the individuals enlighten regarding the disease to take safeguards such as vaccination, wearing protective masks, social distancing etc., to minimize their risks of being infected [27, 28] . How long and how effectual media related impact persists is thus an important issue for future outbreak, and quantifying this impact through a modeling process falls within the scope of our investigation. Several mathematical models have been incorporated with the assumption that the media related awareness has an impact on reducing the contact rate of susceptible and infected population [26, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] . Influenced by those literatures we develop and analyze a mathematical model for coronavirus to study the impact of media related awareness program.",

This media creates the behavioral alteration in the susceptible populations to save themselves from contracting infection.

Albeit individuals are informed through media, not everyone responses to it due to insufficiency of resources, irresponsive nature and economic condition etc. Therefore a part of susceptible individuals with news regarding coronavirus, responding to the news for corona symptoms and altering their behavior to avoid infection, and will move to the recovered individuals. The rate of behavioral response through media has been considered to be a function of both the densities for susceptible populations and media, that is, f (S(t), M(t)). Moreover, we assume that the source of media is a function of I(t), that is, f m (I(t)), as the source of media depends on the density of symptomatic populations.

The rate of change of recovered individuals can be written by the ODE: We assume that the source of media related information index is proportional to the number of symptomatic individuals. The function f m (I) represents the growth of information index rate, which depend on the symptomatic individuals. While the coronavirus outbreaks, the World Health Organization (WHO), health agencies, social media, government and non-government organization become dynamic to spread the information or media awareness in concerning the prevalence of coronavirus.",

One more example could be f m (I) = \u03b1mI 1+\u03b2mI , where I indicates the nonlinear increasing function for the prevalence of the coronavirus, which could be considered as a measure of the perceived risk for the infection rather than the original one [28, 37] .

In a more general way R 0 can be stated as the number of new infections created by a typical infective population at an infection free equilibrium. R 0 < 1 determines on average an infected population creates less than one new infected population during the course of its infective period, and the infection can die out. In reverse way, R 0 > 1 determines each infected population creates, on average, more than one new infection, and the disease can spread over the population.

To control the coronavirus outbreaks, the draw the contour plots for the R 0 with respect to the positively correlated parameters, namely disease transmission coefficient \u03b2 s and the clinical outbreak rate q a for all the infected classes in the Figure 7 . The contour plot represents the dependence of R 0 for the four states (Kerala, Delhi, West Bengal, Maharashtra) and the Republic of India. Contour plot indicates that for the higher values of \u03b2 s and q a the reproduction number R 0 become high, which means the coronavirus may enter the stage-3 and it spread through the community. Therefore, to control R 0 must be restrict the values of the transmission coefficient \u03b2 s and the portion q a by which the exposed class become symptomatically ill. To keep the mortality rate as low as possible, we must be take the values of \u03b2 s and q a as small as possible.

The impact of media awareness effect for the daily cumulative confirmed cases of coronavirus diseases for symptomatic classes are shown in the To study the future outbreaks of coronavirus diseases, we simulate our system (8) for a long days of the infected individuals, namely asymptomatic individuals and symptomatic or clinically ill individuals for the parameters are listed in the Table I and we have considered the estimated   parameters for the Table II in case of Indian data only with initial population sizes are given in the Table IV . The model simulation represented that the people from overall India can experience future epidemics if the control policies are not implemented more effectively, as shown in the Figure 10 . The number of infected individuals (asymptomatic and symptomatic) are oscillate around 130 days and around 320 days. This can be interpreted as the reproduction number R 0 is always greater than unity in India (see the Table V for India) . Otherwise, we can say that the impact of media related awareness is a dynamic process and the media has a great impact in reducing the transmission of coronavirus outbreaks at the initial stage of an epidemic. The factors like low air temperature and as well low humidity has a great impact on the transmission of novel coronavirus [11] . Moreover, to control the future outbreaks of novel coronavirus the media related awareness programme and the control strategy must be implemented properly. In this manuscript, we propose a compartmental epidemic model on novel coronavirus diseases by incorporating the effect of media awareness to predict and control the outbreak. In our model we noted that media awareness play a key role in generating public consciousness and encouraging disease measures [42] . In our proposed model, we consider two infectious individuals, namely asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals with former being a fast spreader of the coronavirus diseases. Our model formulation is based on the work by Gumel et al. [7] , where we estimate the system parameters based on the PRCC sensitivity analysis at an early stage of the outbreak, in which the number of cumulative classes grow exponentially.",

PRCC analysis yields the most sensitive parameters are \u03b2 s , q a , \u03b3 i , \u03b1 h , \u03be a and \u03be h out of 17 input parameters without incorporating media impact. Then we estimated these 7 parameters based on the data from four different states and from the entire India.

As we know, for R 0 < 1 the diseases can be died out. Thus, to keep control the value of R 0 we must reduce \u03b2 s and q a . While investigating the contour plot, we observe that for the lower values for \u03b2 s and q a , the reproduction number can be controlled and reduced to less than unity, as shown in the Figure 7 . Thus, if we are able to control the social distancing, then we are able to control the basic reproduction number R 0 and hence we are able to eradicate the coronavirus diseases. Since R 0 quantifies the initial epidemic transmission, its sensitivity indices enable us to establish the relative significance of various parameters in coronavirus transmission.",

It is worthy to mention that the media impact is not always remain efficacious for mitigating disease transmission throughout the epidemic [43] . A detailed understanding of media awareness during an outbreak can help in the progression of an implementable public health strategy. A particular interest to the designers of such strategies are the effects of media awareness on some significant epidemic features such as the size of the peak, its timing and the whole number of diseases.

The first sub-figure of theFigure 8represents the corresponding profiles of symptomatic individuals for the overall India in absence and presence of media awareness programme with the available time period 60 days. Observe that the blue curve has the highest peak or the proliferation of symptomatic population is high and sharp in compare to the other curves, which indicates that the sizes of symptomatic individuals increases and reaches to its maximum peak in absence of media awareness as the source of information index (\u03b1 m ) and the rate of media response (\u03b7 m ) both are zero. To investigate how often and/or how long the media awareness effect remains dynamic, we simulate our coronavirus disease model(8).But in presence of active media awareness, both \u03b1 m and \u03b7 m are nonzero, and for fixed \u03b1 m = 0.01 when we varied the rate of media response \u03b7 m = 0.1 and \u03b7 m = 0.5, the thick red curve and dotted red curve decreases but the peak of both the red curves are below the thick blue curve. For fixed media response \u03b7 m = 0.15 when we varied the source rate of information index \u03b1 m = 0.015 and \u03b1 m = 0.025, it can be noted that the thick green curve and dotted green curve decreases but the peak of both the green curves are below the thick blue cure. The model simulation (in case of overall India) showed in the first figure of Figure 8, it can be noted that in presence of media effect the count of symptomatic individuals decreases. It is worthy to mention that the media has an impact on the prevalence of the outbreak of coronavirus diseases. It is fascinating to observe that the media effect remains dynamic almost until the highest peak of the disease outbreak, has been shown in the Figure 8. Similar interpretations can be made for the four provinces of the Republic of India, namely Delhi, Maharashtra, Kerala and West Bengal, in presence of media related awareness programme for daily confirmed new cases of coronavirus diseases of symptomatic individuals.From the model simulation, we can conclude that the media awareness has an impact on the reduction of coronavirus diseases for the symptomatic individuals, as shown in theFigure 8.",

Thus, the media related awareness reduces the peak of symptomatic individuals in case of cumulative confirmed coronavirus diseases, which shows that the media awareness play a key role on the prevalence of the outbreak of coronavirus diseases, as shown in theFigure 9. It is very interesting to note that the media effect remains effectual almost until the maximum peak of the disease epidemic. Similar conclusions can be drawn for four provinces of India, namely Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi and West Bengal in presence of effective media awareness for daily cumulative confirmed cases of symptomatic populations. Thus, the media awareness has a great impact to control the coronavirus diseases, as shown in theFigure 9.",

Also the recruitment rate \u039b s for four different states and overall India are listed in the Table IV.A. PRCC sensitivity analysis To identify the most sensitive parameters with respect to symptomatic population, we performed a sensitivity analysis by using Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC) technique for all the input parameters against the variable I. The set of most sensitive parameters, which have the ability to reduce the outbreak of coronavirus diseases, can be estimated from the available data from different states (Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal) as well as the scenario of entire India. In our coronavirus system (8) has 17 parameters (without media) for which we varied all the system parameters simultaneously. PRCC quantifies the relationship among a state equation of interest and each of model parameters. As a result PRCC aid to obtain the important parameters, which contribute most to the system variability. For model simulation, we consider the PRCC values between -1.0 and +1.0. Following the method established by Marino et al. [40], we performed Latin hypercube sampling and generated 2800 samples to compute the PRCC and the p-values with reference to the symptomatic classes at the day 60. The",
