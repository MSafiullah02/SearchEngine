            "text": "Porcine circovirus (PCV) is the first and smallest animal virus shown to possess a circular, single\u2010stranded DNA genome that replicates autonomously in mammalian cells (Tischer, Gelderblom, & Vettermann, 1982). PCV1 and PCV2 are the two basic genotypes of PCV. PCV1 is a cell culture\u2010derived virus and is considered non\u2010pathogenic for swine. PCV2 is the primary causative agent of porcine circovirus\u2010associated diseases (PCVAD) in swine; PCVAD has been referred to by different names, the most common being postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Furthermore, porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS), proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia, respiratory disease and enteritis were also linked to PCV2 infections (Allan et al., 2000; Madson et al., 2009; Grau\u2010Roma & Segal\u00e9s, 2007; Cheng et al., 2011; Kim & Chae, 2004) and have caused a huge economic loss to the pig industry worldwide. PCV3, a novel genotype of PCV, was first reported in pigs with cardiac and multisystemic inflammation in 2016 (Phan et al., 2016). About the same time, pigs were detected having PCV3 with PDNS, and reproductive failure was reported (Palinski et al., 2016).",

            "text": "The PCV2 genome is composed of 1,767\u20131,768 nucleotides and predicted to possess eleven open reading frames (ORFs). The intergenic region (IR) contains the origin of replication with a stem\u2010loop (SL) structure, which includes an octanucleotide sequence (Oc8) flanked by palindromes (Faurez, Dory, Grasland, & Jestin, 2009). Two major ORFs, ORF1 and ORF2, encode replicase (Rep) and capsid protein (Cap), respectively. Cap contains one putative N\u2010glycosylation site at position 143\u2013145aa (NYS) (Nawagitgul et al., 2002), while Rep contains three potential glycosylation sites at positions 23\u201325aa (NPS), 256\u2013258aa (NQT) and 286\u2013288aa (NAT) (Mankertz, Mankertz, Wolf, & Buhk, 1998). Regarding clinical aspects, PCV2 is ubiquitous, having both domestic and feral swine hosts; most pigs become infected at 4\u201311 weeks of age. The common presenting clinical signs of PMWS include wasting or unthriftiness, dyspnoea and visibly enlarged lymph nodes (Segales, Allan, & Domingo, 2005). Characteristic PDNS symptoms are irregular, red\u2010to\u2010purple macules and papules in the skin; subcutaneous haemorrhages and oedema of affected areas; enlarged lymph nodes, mainly inguinal superficial; cutaneous scars in animals that have recovered from the acute phase; bilaterally enlarged kidneys; small cortical petechiae and oedema of the renal pelvis; and occasional spleen infarcts (Segal\u00e9s, 2012).",
