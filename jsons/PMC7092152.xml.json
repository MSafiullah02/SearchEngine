            "text": "Gene therapy is currently being evaluated for a wide range of acute and chronic lung diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cancer, asthma, emphysema and cystic fibrosis (CF), not least because of the comparatively easy noninvasive accessibility of the lungs through aerosols. The lung is a complex organ and can be roughly divided into two main regions: the airways, consisting of trachea, bronchi, large and small airways, which transport air to the peripheral lung, and the alveoli, where gas exchange takes place (Figure 1). The cell types facing the lumen vary greatly from pseudostratified, columnar ciliated and nonciliated epithelium in the larger airways, to single-layer cuboidal epithelium in the small airways and type I and II pneumocytes in the alveolar epithelium.1 The requirement of gene transfer into the individual cell types will very much depend on the target disease. In addition, tumour and perhaps inflammatory cells may also be important targets for gene transfer. Over the last decade, the gene therapy community has recognized that there is not even one vector that is good for all applications, but that the gene transfer agent (GTA) has to be carefully chosen depending on the cell type to be targeted, the number of treatments (one versus repeat administration) required, and the size and nature (secreted versus cellular product) of the gene to be delivered.",

Although several organs are affected, severe lung disease is the cause of most of the morbidity and mortality in CF individuals.2 The CF gene, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), was cloned in 19893 and is a chloride channel located in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. Mutations in the CFTR gene lead to imbalanced ion and water movement across the airway epithelium, resulting in accumulation of sticky mucus, chronic bacterial infection and inflammation. Proof-of-principle for CFTR gene transfer was quickly established in vitro and in animal models.4, 5 The first clinical trials in CF patients were carried out in 1993 and to date 29 trial protocols, most of which have been completed, are published (http://www.wiley.co.uk/genmed/clinica/). The initial hope was that CF gene therapy would progress rapidly, due to the ease of noninvasive access to the lungs, but delivery of the gene to the relevant cells remains a difficult task. Here, we will review the considerable progress that has been made in pre-clinical and clinical gene therapy studies for CF over the last couple of years.",

            "text": "In non-CF individuals, CFTR is not expressed abundantly in the lungs, but high expression is seen in serous cells in the submucosal glands and isolated epithelial cells in the small airways.6 It is currently unclear which of these cell types is the main target for CF gene therapy. However, given that CF, at least in the early stages, presents as a small airway disease, airway epithelial cells (AECs) are likely to be an important target. Topical delivery of GTA to the lung is currently the preferred method for airway gene transfer. However, before the GTA can reach the surface of the epithelial cells, a number of extracellular physical and immunological barriers have to be overcome (reviewed in Ferrari et al7 and Weiss8). Briefly, the airway epithelium in the lung is generally covered by a thin mucus layer (Figure 2), whose main role is to trap invading foreign particles. It has been shown that mucus significantly reduces the transfection efficiency of most viral and nonviral GTAs. However, transfection efficiency could be increased through pretreatment with mucolytics or the anticholinergic drug glycopyrrolate in vitro and in vivo.9 In CF patients, particularly at later stages in the disease, the airways are also filled with sticky sputum, consisting of inflammatory cells, cell debris, mucus and DNA. To avoid the confounding effect of sputum in vivo, gene transfer should ideally be carried out early in the course of lung disease, before the lungs become filled with secretions. The glycocalyx is also a barrier to gene transfer and pretreatment with neuraminidase, which removes sialic acid residues, enhances adenovirus (Ad) transfection of polarized cells in vitro.10 Although not formerly shown, it is likely that cilia also lead to steric hindrance of GTA to the apical surface of epithelial cells.",

In an attempt to increase the transfection efficiency of adenoviral vectors in vivo, Gregory et al17 assessed the effects of sodium caprate (a tight junction opener) application to the luminal surface of AECs in mouse lung, with the rationale that CAR expression is higher on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells. Gene expression in total lung homogenate was increased 25-fold, which further increased to 45-fold when adenovirus was complexed with 2-(diethylamino)ethyl ether (DEAE) dextran. However, it is unclear if this increase in gene expression was attributable to increased epithelial cell transfection. A controversial issue is whether such tight junction openers can be used clinically, given the heavy bacterial colonization present in the CF lung and the attendant risk of systemic invasion.",

This vector contains the complete human CFTR cDNA and uses AAV inverted terminal repeat (ITR)-based promoter elements. Phase I studies aerosolizing AAV2-CFTR into CF patients with mild-to-moderate lung disease have been conducted. There were no safety problems and the vector was detected in the proximal airways: however, vector-specific mRNA was not found.20 A phase II trial was also undertaken in the maxillary sinuses of CF patients.21 Although the good safety profile was confirmed, none of the primary end points, including the time to sinusitis relapse, histopathology and interleukin (IL)-8 measurements, changed significantly when compared to the contralateral control sinus. Most recently, results of the first repeat-administration lung trial (three doses of nebulized AAV2 1 month apart) were published. The treatment was well tolerated and showed some evidence of improved lung function and reduced IL-8 in induced sputum after the first administration. A follow-up trial sufficiently powered to detect pulmonary changes has recently started.22",

Strategies to overcome the AAV packaging problem have therefore been developed, including approaches based on trans-splicing23 and homologous recombination.24 The basic principle of these techniques is to split the therapeutic cDNA and required regulatory elements, and package them into two viruses, which when transfecting the same cell may recombine and generate a full-length therapeutic gene. One would speculate that both of these strategies would lead to reduced transfection efficiency, when compared with the administration of one intact virus to the lung.

These viruses have a negative-strand RNA genome and replicate in the cytoplasm. They do not go through a DNA intermediate and do not enter the nucleus. Only SeV has been assessed in animal models in vivo and is currently the most efficient virus for airway gene transfer. First-generation recombinant SeV carrying CFTR cDNA can produce functional CFTR chloride channels in vitro and after transfection of the nasal epithelium in CF knockout mice.33 Further improvements in the SeV vectors have been made by deleting the F-protein from the viral backbone (\u0394F), which rendered the second-generation viruses transmission-incompetent. Inoue et al35 have further improved the \u0394F/SeV vector by introducing mutations into the matrix (M) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins, which reduce the amount of virus-like particles that are produced after transfection, thereby further improving the safety profile. SeV-mediated gene expression is transient (lasting for about 7 days) and currently repeated administration is inefficient. Several groups, including our own, are assessing a variety of immuno-modulatory strategies to improve the use of SeV for chronic lung diseases.",

The receptor recognizes a conserved five-amino-acid-binding motif, but tolerates large variation in the attached cargo. Sec-R-directed complexes are prepared by condensing plasmid DNA with a covalent conjugate of a peptide receptor ligand (17 amino acids) and polylysine. Ziady et al43 have recently demonstrated partial correction of the chloride transport defect in the nasal epithelium of CF knockout mice following administration of Sec-R ligand complexed to a CFTR plasmid. In nondividing cells, the nuclear membrane appears to be an important barrier to gene transfer and one reason why Sec-R ligand polylysine complexes transfect airway cells efficiently might be their small size. With a diameter of 18\u201325 nm, these nanoparticles may be able to enter the nucleus via passive diffusion through the nuclear pore complex, which has a cutoff size of about 25 nm. However, formulation and stability problems have so far prevented phase I clinical trials. Peptides resembling integrin-binding domains have also been linked to plasmid DNA and have been shown to transfect the airway epithelium of pigs when delivered at bronchoscopy.44 It remains to be established if antipeptide immune responses will interfere with using peptide-carrying nonviral formulations for chronic diseases, but the risk of immune responses against the peptide can be minimized by using conserved human peptide sequences. Importantly, traditionally used animal models may not be suitable to evaluate efficiency or repeat administration of human peptide formulation, if the chosen sequence is not conserved within the animal model.",

            "text": "Systemic delivery has long been postulated as a means for lung transfection and intravenous (i.v.) injection of many nonviral GTAs leads to lung transfection. It is important to note that for the vast majority of GTAs gene transfer is only achieved in alveolar endothelial cells and maybe pneumocytes, because the GTA gets trapped in the alveolar capillaries of the pulmonary circulation, the first capillary bed encountered after i.v. administration, but are found only rarely in the conducting airways, which are the targets for CF gene therapy. To be able to transfect the conducting airway epithelium, the GTA has to pass through the pulmonary circulation, reach the left side of the heart and travel from there to the bronchial circulation, which supplies the airways (Figure 3). Here, the GTA has to escape from the vessels and migrate through a dense layer of extracellular matrix to the basement membrane of the AECs. We have recently demonstrated that naked oligonucleotides are able to follow this route and transfect the cytoplasm of AECs efficiently.50 Koehler et al51 have shown that the bronchial epithelium and submucosal glands can be transfected using plasmid DNA complexed to the cationic liposome DODAC:DOPE, although this was not reproducible with other lipids and appears to be a characteristic property of this particular liposome. A better understanding of liposome structure and charge interaction in the context of serum proteins will help with the rational design of nonviral GTA for systemic CF gene therapy. The addition of ligands for receptor-mediated uptake may also improve the transfection efficiency of AECs after i.v. delivery and proof-of-principle for this concept has been published several years ago. Ferkol et al52 have shown that addition of ligands to the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor increases AECs transfection following systemic administration. The addition of moieties to increase organ and cell-type specific targeting will be important to minimize systemic gene transfer and toxicity.",

If successful, gene repair should ensure gene expression for the lifetime of the cells and appropriate control of gene expression is likely because the endogenous CFTR promoter is utilized. Our preliminary results indicated that the genomic CFTR locus could be modified in primary rat hepatocytes, but not primary AECs, using chimeraplasts (DNA/RNA hybrid oligonucleotides).53 Hepatocytes have previously been shown to be easily amenable for gene repair strategies, most likely due to efficient uptake of repair molecules into the nucleus. In addition, a similar approach using small-fragment homologous recombination (SFHR) was able to reintroduce the wild-type CFTR sequence into the lungs of CF knockout mice.54 Overall, the mechanisms involved in gene repair are not well understood and it is currently uncertain if the required \u2018repair\u2019 proteins are present in terminally differentiated AECs. In addition, uptake of repair oligonucleotides into the nucleus of AECs ex vivo and in vivo remains inefficient (Uta Griesenbach, unpublished observation) and is the first hurdle that needs to be overcome, before gene repair can be assessed.",

Several other chaperone proteins, mucins or the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), which is hyperactive in CF, may be suitable candidates for antisense strategies.

The development of new CFTR-specific assays involving epithelial cell-specific detection of CFTR mRNA and protein, bacterial adherence to AECs, airway surface liquid height measurements and others are currently a major focus of the UK Cystic Fibrosis Gene Therapy Consortium (www.cfgenetherapy.org.uk). For clinical studies, the most relevant end points are a reduction in decline of lung function over time and of episodes of infection. However, these end points are not suitable for early phase II trials, because large patient numbers (>500) and long follow-up (>12 months) would be required.62 It is therefore crucial to identify clinical surrogate end points (such as bacterial burden, inflammatory markers and imaging) that can be assessed in smaller patient cohorts with shorter follow-up. It is unlikely that one-time administration of a short acting GTA will change these clinical surrogate end points, but will more likely require repeat administration and it is therefore important to design future gene therapy trials with these surrogate end points in mind. An extensive discussion about assays is outside the scope of this review, but has recently been reviewed.63",

Many strategies to overcome this problem have already been explored, but have not yet been successful. In our view, this may be a difficult hurdle to overcome. Nonviral gene transfer has traditionally been inefficient, but recently developed nanoparticles and ligand-targeting appear to be overcoming this problem. Importantly, physical delivery methods to increase nonviral gene transfer are currently being assessed in the lung. Although gene therapy for CF is not yet a clinical reality, the many innovative strategies currently being assessed should lead to efficient and repeatable airway gene transfer within the next few years.",
