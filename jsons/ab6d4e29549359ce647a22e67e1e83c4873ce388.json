            "text": "Consider the situation where an analyst has a Bayesian statistical model that performs well for continuous data. However, suppose the observed data set consists of multiple response types (e.g., continuous, count-valued, Bernoulli trials, etc.), which are distributed from more than one class of distributions. We refer to these types of data as \"multi-response\" data sets. The goal of this article is to introduce a reasonable easy-to-implement all-purpose method that \"converts\" a Bayesian statistical model for continuous responses (call this the preferred model) into a Bayesian model for multi-response data sets. To do this, we consider a transformation of the data, such that the transformed data can be be reasonably modeled using the preferred model. What is unique with our strategy is that we treat the transformations as unknown and use a Bayesian approach to model this uncertainty. The implementation of our Bayesian approach to unknown transformations is straightforward, and involves two steps. The first step produces posterior replicates of the transformed data from a latent conjugate multivariate (LCM) model. The second step involves generating values from the posterior distribution implied by the preferred model. We demonstrate the flexibility of our model through an application to Bayesian additive regression trees (BART), spatial mixed effects (SME) models, and the multivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model (MSTM). To further illustrate the potential wide use of this approach, we provide an analysis of zero-inflated records of public costs due to natural disasters obtained from the National Oceanic Atmospheric Association's (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).",

For example, Bernoulli data is modeled hierarchically, where the logit of the probability of success can be analyzed using an analysts preferred model. GLMMs lack conjugacy, which creates noticeable difficulty when implementing a GLMM on a modern high-dimensional data set. A more recent alternative is the LCM. Basic theoretical results and empirical analyses in Bradley et al. (2018) , Hu and Bradley (2018) , H.-C. Yang et al. (2019) , Bradley et al. (2019c) , and Bradley et al. (2019a) suggest that one can outperform a standard GLMM (specifically Latent Gaussian Process (LGP) models) in terms of prediction error. However, the LCM requires the preferred model to be a mixed effects model and to modify the distribution of random effects to follow the appropriate distribution based on conjugacy.",

In the non-Bayesian setting this literature is extremely well-developed and includes the Box-Cox transformations (Box and Cox, 1964) , the alternating conditional expectations (ACE; Breiman and Friedman, 1985) algorithm, graphical techniques (McCulloch, 1993) , and the Yeo-Johnson power transformation (Yeo and Johnson, 2000) , among other techniques. More recently developments in rank based algorithms (Servin and Stephens, 2007; McCaw et al., 2019; Beasley et al., 2009 ) and quantile-matching (McCullagh and Tresoldi, 2020) have also been proposed in the non-Bayesian setting. It is important to note that Bayesian models for transformations have been proposed as well, but focus on the case where continuous non-normal data are observed and the preferred model assumes normality. In particular, these Bayesian models put a prior on the free parameter within the Box-Cox transformation or the Yeo-Johnson power transformation (Kim et al., 2013; Charitidou et al., 2015 Charitidou et al., , 2018 .

Consequently, the prior distribution of the transformation (b) is modeled with a DY distribution. This is a new way in Bayesian statistics to model non-Gaussian processes using models for continuous data. The implementation of our approach is straightforward, and can be done using composite sampling. In particular, the first step is to sample from the posterior distribution of the transformation. Then the second step is to sample from the conditional distribution of the latent process of interest given the transformation. This conditional distribution is derived from the preferred model. The first step of the composite sampler is computationally straightforward because the DY distribution is conjugate (and easy to sample from) with the exponential family.

This is because GLMMs in the non-Gaussian setting have full-conditional distributions that are not Gaussian, and can not be sampled from immediately. Bayesian meth-ods that do not have easy to sample from full-conditional distributions require difficult to tune Metropolis-Hastings algorithms (e.g., see Bradley et al., 2019a , for an example), inefficient rejection samplers (e.g., see Damien et al., 1999) , or significant reparameterization to make approximate Bayesian methods (that are only appropriate for small parameter spaces) practical (Rue et al., 2009; Neal, 2011) .

Additionally, in Section 4 we provide a joint spatial analysis of a spatiotemporal zero-inflated data set (i.e., continuous and binary responses) consisting of public costs of natural disasters (in billions of USD) records obtained from the National Oceanic Atmospheric Association's (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). To analyze this data we apply our approach to the multivariate spatio-temporal mixed effects model (MSTM) from Bradley et al.

This similarity emphasizes the flexibility of allowing for unknown transformations in a Bayesian context, since the bootstrap algorithm is an established flexible approach in the literature (e.g., see Efron, 1992 , for an early reference). Of course, the bootstrap algorithm produces replicates from a different distribution than that of Algorithm 1. Specifically, the bootstrap method results in an approximate sample from the sampling distribution of a statistic. Whereas, the composite sampling approach in Algorithm 1 can be seen as a means to sample from (4). This is also different from the Bayesian bootstrap (Rubin, 1981) , which does not restrict the samples to be from a posterior distribution of the form in (4).",
