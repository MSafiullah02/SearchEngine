For RNA virus such as coronavirus, it is known that PAMPs found in replicating viruses in the form of viral genomic ssRNA or double\u2010stranded RNA that are recognized by either the endosomal RNA receptors, TLR8, and TLR7 in ssRNA and the cytosolic RNA sensor, RIG (retinoid\u2010inducible gene)/MDA5 (melanoma differentiation\u2010associated gene 5).14, 20, 21 This recognition event leads to activation of several signaling pathways and ultimately transcription factors, that is, nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u2010\u03baB), activator protein 1 (AP\u20101), interferon response factor 3 (IRF3), and IRF7 accompanied by their nuclear translocation. NF\u2010\u03baB and AP\u20101 stimulate the expression of genes encoding many of the molecules required for inflammatory responses, including inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor [TNF] and IL\u20101) and chemokines (eg, CCL2 and CXCL8). IRF3 and IRF7 promote the production of type I interferon (IFN\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b2), which are important for antiviral innate immune responses and able to suppress viral replication and dissemination at an early stage.22, 23 This process can cause complications such as exhaustion, weakness, and cough in patients.\n24\n The important point is, for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, the response to viral infection by type I IFN is suppressed (Figure 3).",
