            "text": "Currently, there are 37 approved drugs for use as antivirals, and upwards of at least 83 new antiviral therapies in clinical trials around the world (The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America; De Clercq, 2004). Some of these are new and improved inhibitors of HIV-1 PR. The introduction of the first PR inhibitors in the 1990s was characterized by excitement and hopes for the control of infection. Since most HIV-1 infected individuals rapidly become resistant to these anti-PR drugs, a need to identify new inhibitors became apparent. Whereas current methodologies to screen for these compounds were based largely on electrophoresis and liquid chromatography methods, it was clear that additional screening assays were also needed to respond to this demand. These would ideally be rapid and capable of high throughput screening (HTS) procedures. Initial efforts using fluorogenic and fluorescence quenching substrates for proteolysis enabled higher throughput screens of anti-PR compounds that could readily be adapted to HTS (Matayoshi et al., 1990, McQuade et al., 1990). More recent efforts using identical chemistry (EDANS, Dabcyl) continue to be used in the development of high throughput microplate assays (Bagossi et al., 2004). Other screening assays for anti-PR drugs rely on in vitro analysis of inhibition of certain biochemical reactions resulting in the production of assayable intermediate metabolites. These in vitro estimates are generally followed up with more detailed pharmacological tests and pharmacological screens in various in vitro and in vivo assays. These assays, however, are non-homogeneous and require a synthetic substrate and are executed entirely in in vitro conditions with purified proteins (Baruch et al., 2004). Ideally, initial screening assays should be as close to physiological conditions as possible and even better, be homogeneous assays that test for inhibition of PR in living cells.",

This is based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, second generation (BRET2), a naturally occurring phenomenon that relies on the resonance energy transfer (RET) between a donour, hRLuc and an acceptor, hGFP2 molecule. This RET is initiated by the addition of DeepBlue C Coelenterazine that is oxidized by the RLuc resulting in the emission of light at 395 nm. Part of the energy can be transferred non-radiatively to a codon-optimized \u2013 humanized \u2013 GFP2 (hGFP2) if the hRluc and the hGFP2 are in close proximity (Forster distance being about 10\u2013100 \u00c5). The hGFP2 will then emit light at 510 nm. Both emissions are quantitated by sequential reading using a combined luminometer and fluorescence plate reader and the emission spectra are sufficiently distinct to allow for straight-forward ratiometric analysis of the hGFP2 and hRLuc signals to assess molecular interactions or proximity between hGFP2 and hRLuc in live cells.",

For example, BRET2 is noninvasive and occurs within live cells, is measured in real time, and is not restricted to cellular compartments making it especially attractive to identify small bioactive inhibitory molecules or for use in the study of protein\u2013protein interactions post-translational modification of proteins in live cells (Angers et al., 2000, Bertrand et al., 2002, Germain-Desprez et al., 2003, Issafras et al., 2002, Perroy et al., 2004). The assay described here utilizes this new technology to assay for HIV-1 PR inhibition in live cells. Specifically, the utility of BRET2 in the establishment of a HIV-1 PR biosensor assay is demonstrated and this assay is validated with the use of several known PR inhibitors. Moreover, because virus\u2013host interactions are also critical to all steps of the viral replication cycle, this assay can also be used to probe for the function of viral proteins that can modulate PR activity and may help elucidate the molecular details of PR function and HIV-1 maturation.",

Furthermore, small molecule compounds have been identified recently that act on selective HIV-1 protease sites to delay maturation of the precursor Gag protein (Zhou et al., 2004).

The DeepBlueC Coelenterazine (BioPackard-Signal Montreal, PQ) cell permeant luciferase substrate was added to each well to obtain a final concentration of 5 \u03bcM. Immediately following this addition, five readings for hRLuc and hGFP2 were sequentially recorded using a Fusion \u221d-FP apparatus (Perkin-Elmer/Canberra Packard). First the light emitted from the bioluminescence resulting from the Rluc-mediated Coelenterazine degradation at 410 nm (band pass of 80 nm) was detected. The hGFP2 emission (peak 505\u2013508 nm) was then detected using a 515 nm filter (band pass of 30 nm). Readings for this analysis were from the top of the plate. The BRET2 ratio was found to be stable over several readings performed at different times after addition of the substrate (evaluated within 5\u20138 min). The expression levels of hGFP2 (non RET-induced) and hRLuc for each experimental condition were determined by direct measurements of total hGFP2 and luminescence levels on aliquots of transfected cell samples as follows. The hGFP2 total fluorescence was measured using Fusion \u221d-FP apparatus (Perkin-Elmer/Canberra-Packard) with an excitation filter of 400 nm and an emission filter of 510 nm, with the following parameters: gain 1; PMT 900\u20131100 V; time 1.0 s. After the fluorescence measurement, the same cells were incubated for 10 min with Coelenterazine H (Molecular Probes) at a final concentration of 5 \u03bcM and the total luminescence of cells was measured using the same instrument set up for bioluminescence readings with the following parameters: gain 1; PMT 700 V; time 0.5 s. In contrast to DeepBlue C Coelenterazine, Coelenterazine H does not lead to energy transfer to hGFP2 and thus allows the assessment of hRluc expression without loss due to energy transfer to hGFP2. When expressed as a ratio, the total hGFP2:hRluc ratio was found to be identical in each experiment indicating stable levels of expression of each protein.",

            "text": "There are nine PR substrates in the Gag/Pol polyprotein (Fig. 1A) that when processed, give rise to functional mature Gag proteins. The BRET2 assay was developed to identify viral and cellular factors that influence HIV-1 PR activity. Several PR sites were originally tested in this BRET2 assay (inset in Fig. 1). An original goal of this study was to compare two protease cleavage sites, one primary PR site that is processed early following PR activation (p2/p7), and another, a secondary PR site that is processed at a later stage during viral maturation (p24/p2). The rationale was to examine early and late events of maturation and to eventually develop a high throughput screen for compounds (such as small molecules or viral and cellular proteins) that that can inhibit either or both of these cleavage reactions. However, the p24/p2 site was not amenable to cleavage by the co-expressed PR and the other site that was tested, the p17/p24 PR substrate, showed variable expression levels (data not shown and see Section 4). Because it was possible that the p24/p2 PR cleavage substrate was too short an amino acid stretch perhaps preventing the PR from binding, the p24/p2 site was extended by the addition of five amino acids on each end (p24/p2ext; Fig. 1). Preliminary tests showed that this did not improve its ability to be cleaved (data not shown). Based on preliminary findings, the p2/Nucleocapsid (p7) PR substrate site was chosen for all subsequent experimentation. Therefore the p2/p7 site was inserted in frame between the hGFP2 and hRLuc cistrons as shown by the red box in Fig. 1. BRET2 analyses were performed following the addition of the membrane permeable hRLuc substrate, DeepBlueC Coelenterazine. The PR substrate sites that were used for all subsequent experimentation include the p2/p7 site, a p2/p7mut, harbouring three amino acid substitutions in the cleavage site (Fig. 1).",

This analysis showed that while there was no detectable cleavage of the parental or hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc fusion protein when the Gag/Pol PR\u2212 was expressed (top panel), the expression of PR mediated the cleavage of hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc fusion protein to yield a hGFP2-p2 signal at about 27 kDa, slightly greater in molecular weight that the hGFP2 signal when expressed alone (bottom panel). These results were also confirmed by blotting with an anti-p24 as shown in Fig. 2A (data not shown). The addition of the HIV-1 PR inhibitors Amprenavir or Saquinavir 12 h before cell harvesting and BRET2 analysis prevented hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc cleavage at the p2/p7 scissile bond when PR was expressed (Fig. 2C), to obtain an identical expression pattern as that obtained with the parental vector.

            "text": "Recent data have demonstrated that the HIV-1 auxiliary protein Vif selectively blocks processing at the CA-NC boundary through steric interference. This results in an accumulation of Gag processing intermediates, p33/p34, consisting of CA and NC and one or both of the spacer peptides, p1 and p2 (Akari et al., 2004). These recent data were then considered in order to validate this BRET2 PR biosensor assay. Using the construct shown in Fig. 1 and the GagPol PR+, increasing concentrations of Vif were overexpressed from a humanized Vif expression plasmid that does not require Rev for expression (Nguyen et al., 2004). This resulted in a detectable increase in Vif expression in these cells with increasing DNA in the transfection (Fig. 3A, top panel). Supraphysiological expression of Vif inhibited p2/p7 cleavage as indicated by the dose-dependent accumulation of the hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc fusion protein and the diminishing abundance of the hGFP2-p2 moiety (Fig. 3A, middle panel). Furthermore, using an anti-p24 or anti-NC (generously provided by Dr. Robert Gorelick), the accumulation of one of the Gag processing intermediates was identified in Western blots (likely p33; Fig. 1, top) when Vif was expressed (not shown). While earlier work showed that Vif mediated the accumulation of p33 and p34 Gag processing intermediates in the context of proviral gene expression, only one of these immunoreactive Gag processing intermediates was detected. This may be due to the conditions of GagPol Pr+ expression used in this manuscript or the low abundance of this Gag species.",

The BRET2 ratio is a direct measure of the degree to which the p2/p7 is cleaved by the coexpressed GagPol (PR+ or PR\u2212). The BRET2 ratio was determined when cells were mock-transfected or transfected with hRLuc or hGFP2 alone in each experiment, in the presence of PR expression or not. There was no BRET2 signal under any of these control transfection conditions (Fig. 3B). Expression of hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc in the absence of PR (i.e. in the context of Gag/Pol PR\u2212) showed a strong BRET2 signal, similar to the levels found when the cells were treated with Saquinavir (with or without HIV-1 PR), Amprenavir or Nelfinavir (data not shown), or transfected with the parental construct with no PR cleavage site (with HIV-1 PR+). hGFP2-p2/p7-hRLuc was efficiently cleaved in the presence of the HIV-1 PR, while a mutant that harbours three amino acid substitutions (Fig. 1) was not cleaved. BRET2 analyses were performed in experiments in which Vif was overexpressed. When Vif was incrementally overexpressed in 293T cells (as in Fig. 3A), the BRET2 analyses reveal that Vif is inhibitory to p2/p7 cleavage and this is reflected in a dose-dependent increase in BRET2 reaching 85% that obtained with PR\u2212. The data in Fig. 3 might suggest that overexpression of any protein will decrease PR activity non-specifically (Akari et al., 2004). Thus, in order to rule this out, either a double-stranded RNA binding mutant (dsRBDmut) form of Staufen or a related dsRNA-binding protein, TRBP was expressed as a control for BRET2 analyses. While a 4- to 8-fold increase in expression of these proteins was achieved as determined by Western blot analyses (data not shown), overexpression of these proteins resulted in a constant BRET2 ratio and did not have an impact on PR activity or the cleavage of the p2/p7 PR site. These overexpression results indicate that Vif's effect on PR action is selective. The histogram presented in Fig. 3B expresses the calculated averages (\u00b1S.E.M.) of the BRET2 analyses from at least five experiments per experimental condition.",

This assay is homogeneous in that it is performed in live cells and there is no need for preparing cell extracts. A simple addition of a membrane-diffusible and non-toxic substrate to initiate the biochemical reaction is required and the readout is RET-induced hGFP2 emission that is readily detectable by a fluorescence plate reader (Fig. 1). The assay also relies on a straight-forward ratiometric calculation between the light emitted caused by interaction of hRLuc with its substrate and the resultant emission from hGFP2, in the case of a RET between these two proteins. This experimental system was first tested using the bicistronic construct in both PR+ and PR\u2212 backgrounds. The results demonstrated appropriate Gag processing by the PR, and a specific cleavage that resulted in a decreased BRET2 ratio in the PR+ context only (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Mutated PR substrates were then introduced between the hRLuc and hGFP2 open reading frames or, alternatively, potent anti-PR drugs Amprenavir and Saquinavir were employed to block PR activity in cells. These control experiments demonstrated the sensitivity of this approach and represent the first validation experiments.",

            "text": "One aim of this study was to test a PR site that was cleaved early (e.g., p2/p7) during maturation and one that was cleaved late (e.g., p24/p2). The inability to efficiently cleave the p24/p2 site, even with an extended PR substrate (p24/p2ext, Fig. 1), suggests that this site must be in a contextually correct state to be a substrate for PR. This does not appear to be the case for the p2/p7 cleavage, however, since this was cleaved efficiently in the minimal context (Fig. 2). Nevertheless, because the p24/p2 site is estimated to be cleaved at about 0.0025% that of the p2/p7 (Pettit et al., 1998), other determinants are required that are not recapitulated in the experimental system used here. Previous reports have demonstrated that correct Gag/Pol dimerisation is necessary for proper assembly. Alternatively, other factors including viral proteins, the context of assembly and budding and the presence of genomic RNA that was shown to be important for HIV-1 and other retroviral PRs might also influence the context (Sheng and Erickson-Viitanen, 1994, Sheng et al., 1997, Zhang et al., 2000, Zhang and Barklis, 1997). It is noteworthy here that earlier reports of fluorescence-based PR in vitro screening assays never employed the Gag p24/p2 PR site indicating that it may not be amenable to this type of analysis. Whereas, these assays have used the p17/p24 PR cleavage site in their in vitro PR assays in which small peptide substrates are employed, the expression of the hGFP2-p17/p24-hRLuc construct that was prepared was too low to be employed in this study (K.H. and A.J.M., data not shown). Reconstitution of the missing factors may be helpful in the identification of selective PR inhibitors of this site.",

The value of this PR biosensor assay has been demonstrated recently and has identified LysRS as a cellular mediator of HIV-1 PR activity (Guo et al., 2005). These data support the notion that LysRS, that is part of the HIV-1 Gag assembly complex (Kleiman and Cen, 2004), can dramatically impact on Gag processing and maturation. The impact of Vif on virus maturation has been derived from earlier reports that demonstrate that Vif associates with Gag (Bouyac et al., 1997) and to genomic RNA (Zhang et al., 2000), has effects on core stability (Ohagen and Gabuzda, 2000), and directly interacts or interferes with HIV-1 PR (Baraz et al., 2002, Bardy et al., 2001). Finally, Vif has been shown to be incorporated into budding virions (Kao et al., 2003). Several of these characteristics are shared between LysRS and Vif. Vif, however, has been shown to selectively influence p2/p7 cleavage by steric interference lending to the idea that it may somehow regulate the timing of PR activity during viral maturation. Processing of the p2/p7 PR site also has an influence on genomic RNA dimer maturation (Shehu-Xhilaga et al., 2001) and future work will have to address how both viral and cellular protein function to coordinate HIV-1 maturation during the budding process.",

            "text": "BRET was first exploited to study the dimerization of circadian proteins in bacteria (Xu et al., 1999) and the association of seven-membrane spanning G protein coupled receptors with their coreceptor or cofactors during signaling reactions (Angers et al., 2000). It was extended to examine tyrosine kinase receptor activation (Boute et al., 2001), transcription factor associations (Germain-Desprez et al., 2003) and more recently BRET2 has been used in several studies on virus-host interactions and HIV-1 coreceptor dynamics in the membrane (Issafras et al., 2002, Babcock et al., 2003, Chatel-Chaix et al., 2004, Guo et al., 2005, Percherancier et al., 2005). Recent work has also employed BRET2 in an in vivo ubiquitination assay (Perroy et al., 2004). BRET is considered a valuable approach and is at the forefront of HTS to identify new and desperately needed pharmacological drugs (Roda et al., 2003). Because small molecule inhibitors that target specific PR sites in HIV-1 have already been identified (Zhou et al., 2004), the assay reported here should prove useful to identify sequence specific inhibitors for HIV-1 PR sites in living cells. This BRET2 PR biosensor assay could also be useful to screen for small molecules that remain active due to drug resistance mutations that can occur in or around the PR sites in Gag (Feher et al., 2002). Finally, this BRET2-based assay can also be adapted to HTS of small molecule inhibitors in living cells by generating a stable indicator cell line that expresses all the necessary components of this assay.",

Briefly, the addition of DeepBlueC Coelenterazine initiates the resonance energy transfer to hGFP2 in the case of a close physical interaction or in the context of a hGFP2-hRLuc fusion protein (Step 1). HIV-1 PR will cleave its substrate (Step 2) to distance the donor and acceptor molecules thereby lowering the RET (Step 3). Inhibitors of PR such as Vif (this manuscript), or PR inhibitors used in HAART will maintain the BRET2 signal because PR activity is inhibited.
