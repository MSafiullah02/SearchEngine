In addition, to cater to the nation's security needsboth external and internal -India has over 1.0 million paramilitary personnel. The military personnel are deployed in diverse harsh environmental conditions to guard national sovereignty under diverse geoclimatic conditions and diverse terrains exposing them to unique conditions that are not perhaps encountered anywhere elsewhere on the globe. Homeland security is an important component of national security. The paramilitary and military personnel inevitably have to participate in low-intensity conflict (LIC) theatres also. Besides, the Indian military has always risen to the occasion and helped in disaster management, whenever there has been a natural calamity. The Indian military personnel have also been an integral part of several successful UN peacekeeping missions.",

            "text": "Keeping the physical and mental health of soldiers is paramount from an operational perspective. In addition, they need to be updated and trained to be able to utilize state-of-the-art technologies. They need to be ever vigilant, be prepared for handling any situation and protecting national interests in a rapidly changing world. In order to keep the military fighting fit for operations, there is a need to equip the soldiers with state-of-the-art technologies, often disruptive technologies, products, processes and requisite paraphernalia with a human engineering perspective to support them and handle today's VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) environment. DRDO well realizes that this can be only accomplished through continuous, concerted R&D with a focus on new technologies and product development, synergizing the private industry sector along with academia. Today's military operations have to be conducted seamlessly, irrespective of environmental stressors like sub-zero temperatures, torrential rains, snow, extremes of humidity, lashing winds, extreme heat, etc. and/or in a nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) environment. In the Indian military context, the environmental hazards posed due to the geographical locale often prove more lethal to the health of a soldier than the military operation itself. More than the threat from enemy bullets is the threat of fluid loss from the body under desert conditions or frostbite and high-altitude pulmonary oedema on mountaintops in winter. High pressure of the water column can limit the performance of submariners. Even those who escape sickness may face problems of performance at altitudes in the Eastern and Western Himalayas, where the atmosphere is rarefied due to low oxygen availability. In fact in Siachen sector, more lives have been lost due to the environmental conditions rather than military operations in this ruthless sector.",

            "text": "Affordable, accessible and acceptable healthcare for all sections of society is the need of the hour. Meeting the health needs of population of over seven billion people, majority of which reside in developing/underdeveloped countries where the population just cannot afford costly healthcare, has necessitated the revival of traditional systems of medicine and the development of cost-effective and pragmatic strategies for the masses. Besides, the disease preventive as well as curative aspects of Indian herbal medicine, its safety and efficacy proved over thousands of years, have made it a preferred choice amongst the masses. The Indian system of medicine, Ayurveda, has evolved as a result of years of medical practice with medicinal plants in humans. India is endowed with extremely rich biodiversity and is home to innumerable medicinal and aromatic plant species which have been used extensively to prevent and/or cure diseases. Similarly, other alternative systems of health like Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy are now officially recognized, and a ministry known as AYUSH -Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathyhas been set up. In view of the huge population of India, it is imperative to develop cost-effective and sustainable health solutions for the public at large. Only one particular system of medicine cannot meet the health challenges posed by the burgeoning population. It is the author's firm belief that we have to consider the rich, Indian traditional systems of medicine for both their preventive and therapeutic aspects and utilize them for meeting the health challenges of our country. Besides, treatments for all diseases are not available in the allopathic system of medicine. The undesirable side effects of modern medicines, the mounting costs of conventional hospital-based healthcare and the emergence of lifestyle-related diseases are some of the reasons for the population to consider alternative simpler and cheaper forms of treatment. Effective and holistic treatment for several diseases like cancer, AIDS, emerging and reemerging bacterial, fungal and viral diseases, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and several emerging and reemerging diseases are still not available in modern systems of medicine leading to more and more patients taking recourse to alternative therapies for improving the quality of life. Table 1 enumerates the reason why recourse to herbal medicine is the natural choice for sustainable, affordable and acceptable healthcare for the population.",

            "text": "Exposure of living organisms to adverse climatic conditions is known to cause stress, which is a non-specific response to the excess demands imposed on the body. A plethora of stressors like physical, chemical, immunological, biological and emotional factors are involved in the manifestation of stress. Soldiers staying and working in adverse climatic conditions such as cold, heat and high altitude also suffer from stress-induced disorders and at times exhibit decreased or suboptimal levels of physical/cognitive performance due to stress. Adaptogens are biologically active substances that are known to improve physical and mental performance under adverse environmental conditions and induce resistance against stressors, CIHP I was tested for its adaptogenic activity using C-H-R animal model. CIHP I helped in improving resistance to C-H-R-induced hypothermia and enhanced poststress recovery to regain Trec 37 C. In Border Security Force volunteers, CIHP I intake was found to restrict combat stress-induced deterioration in both physical and mental performance (Srivastava et al. 1996) . Another Composite Indian Herbal Preparation II (CIHP II), a combination of numerous plant ingredients and minerals (Table 2) , was tested for its adaptogenic action using C-H-R animal model. The acclimatization to hypoxia of extreme altitude was facilitated by the administration of CIHP II during exposure (Grover et al. 1995) . Both CIHP I and II augmented oxygen delivery to biological system by increasing red cell 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid levels during hypobaric hypoxic exposure and improved cellular membrane permeability and maintenance of blood glucose and muscle glycogen levels. CIHPs also regulated the mobilization of lipids from adipose tissue and their preferential utilization for thermogenesis as compared to carbohydrates (Grover et al. 1995; Kumar et al. 1999 Kumar et al. , 2000 . The above studies conducted at DIPAS have indicated that the Ayurvedic herbal preparations/rasayanas with adaptogenic activity increase the high altitude and cold tolerance and relieve the incapacitating effect of stress on operational performance. Stress is a part and parcel of modern-day life. Prolonged and persistent stress can lead to psychophysiological and metabolic disorders like hypertension, diabetes, gastric ulcer, cardiovascular ailments, etc. A non-specific, antistress procedure/ process and herbal or chemical intervention can help in the restoration of normal homoeostasis of the body. The soldier faces innumerable stresses while on military assignments. A potent herbal antistress adaptogen (DIP-91) has been developed for soldiers using a single herbal component, which is specifically effective in alleviating high-altitude stress (Fig. 3) .",

Hippophae salicifolia and Hippophae rhamnoides turkestanica, are widely distributed in the Himalayan region and possess adaptogenic properties, which alleviate high-altitude stress. Hippophae salicifolia has been shown to have potential application in high-altitude stress management (Fig. 4) . Rathor et al. (2015) evaluated the mechanism of action of both the species against multiple stresses [cold-hypoxia-restraint (C-H-R)]. They reported the adaptogenic activity of Hippophae salicifolia in facilitating tolerance to CHR in rats. Pretreatment with Hippophae salicifolia significantly attenuated reactive oxygen species production, protein oxidation and lipid peroxidation and also helped maintain antioxidant status. Pretreatment of Hippophae salicifolia resulted in decreased protein oxidation, and protein homoeostasis was sustained by regulation of heat shock proteins (HSP70 and HSP60). Interestingly, heme oxygenase-1, vascular endothelial growth factor and nitric oxide level were also Hippophae salicifolia: potential application in high-altitude stress management increased in Hippophae salicifolia pretreated rats proving its adaptogenic activity against cold-hypoxia-restraint. Conclusively, aqueous extract of Hippophae salicifolia could be used as an adaptogen for high-altitude-associated multiple stress. Sharma et al. (2015) have attributed the potent in vitro antioxidant potential of the extracts of the leaves of Hippophae salicifolia and Hippophae rhamnoides mongolica (as compared to Hippophae rhamnoides turkestanica) to the in vivo adaptogenic performance in animals during cold and hypoxia exposure under restraint stress. For adaptogenic studies, rats with oral drug supplementation were exposed to cold-hypoxia-restraint (C-H-R) stresses-induced hypothermia to determine endurance. Aqueous extracts of Hippophae salicifolia showed maximum (99%) resistance compared to the other Hippophae spp. The levels of biochemical parameters such as reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, lactate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione and catalase in blood samples also revealed that the aqueous leaf extract of Hippophae salicifolia exhibited superior antioxidant and adaptogenic potential and established its usefulness for high-altitude stress management.",

Of this diversity, nearly 25% species are endemic to the Himalayas. The Himalayas are considered to be a treasure house of medicinal, aromatic, edible wild and other important plants, which have been used by the local populations for meeting their daily necessities since ages, and this long dependence on plant wealth enriched their knowledge about the multifarious uses of phytodiversity. The highaltitude regions of Ladakh and Lahaul-Spiti in the North West and Tawang in the North East are strategically important because of the international borders with China and Pakistan. The Armed Forces, deployed in these regions, have to face extreme environmental conditions, as the region is prone to landslides, heavy rainfall, cloud bursts, avalanches and natural calamities. At times, these landlocked areas become inaccessible by road and/or air. In view of the likelihood of availability of food and medicines in such areas becoming compromised under certain operational conditions, a need was felt to develop databases on wild plants that can help sustenance and survival of troops in such regions in case of an emergency. The survival garden can play an important role in helping the troops operate unhindered under any circumstances.",

It promotes rapid and aesthetic healing, is rich in natural antioxidants and bioactive polyphenols/flavonoids and aids in healing of wounds by acting at cellular and molecular level. It has been proven to augment healing via wound contraction, re-epithelialization, cellular proliferation, collagen accumulation and neovascularization. Herbo Healer has antibacterial properties and has been shown to be way better than silver sulfadiazine and other iodine-based ointments. The safety and toxicological studies have proven it to be safe for dermal applications. ToT has been transferred to reputed firms. ",

However, there is no universal classification that is unanimously acceptable. A radioprotector can be defined as a substance [element, chemical or a compound of synthetic or molecular nature or biological compound(s)] that reduces the deleterious effects of radiation, when administered to living organisms, usually prior to irradiation (prophylactic administration), while radiorecovery agents are those that help in recuperation and augment recovery once the living organism has been exposed to radiation. Most agents available today fall in the former category. Since the damage resulting due to ionizing radiation in most cases cannot be totally reversed, the currently available radiorecovery agents exhibit limited efficacy. There is immense interest now to develop both categories of agents so that radiation damage can be treated holistically.",

Nair et al. (2001) have classified radioprotective agents into three categories: (i) radioprotectors, (ii) adaptogens and (iii) absorbents. Radioprotectors include compounds like antioxidants and others that possess sulfhydryl groups. Adaptogens in general are non-toxic stimulators of radioresistance. Usually these are natural biological protectors that offer protection against low levels of ionizing radiation primarily by regulating immunity and modulating the endogenous antioxidants, thereby improving non-specific resistance in biological systems. The last category comprises of absorbents that protect against internal radiation injuries that result due to ingestion of radionuclides. Such agents prevent the incorporation and absorption of radionuclides like 90 Sr, 137 Cs, 239 Pu, 131 I, etc. A large number of plant-derived compounds are known to possess highly effective absorbent capability.",

The aryltetralin lignans synthesized by the taxon are in great demand worldwide due to their use in the synthesis of topoisomerase inhibitors and form an integral part of the modern chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of a variety of cancers. The radioprotective and anti-HIV properties are further likely to increase the demand for lignans and related molecules produced by this important plant species. In order to maintain continued production of these aryltetralin lignans, the plant has to be harvested on a large scale from its natural environment, and this has resulted in the plant's endangered status, which now finds mention in the Red Data Book. The chemical synthesis of podophyllotoxin is complicated, and in view of the difficulties in its total chemical synthesis (due to the presence of four chiral centres along with a \u03b3-lactone and a high degree of oxygenation), problems in cultivation on large scale and failure of metabolic engineering approaches, there is a need for alternative sources of production of aryltetralin lignans. To circumvent the problem of production of radioprotective secondary metabolites, a novel endophytic fungus (Trametes hirsuta) was isolated from high-altitude P. hexandrum with the capability to synthesize podophyllotoxin and other lignans and possessing amenability for scale-up in bioreactors Fig. 29) . Methodology for consistent production of the aryltetralin lignans was established, and methods for characterization by HPLC, LC-MS, LC/MS-MS and 1H-NMR were developed and standardized. The lignans Fig. 28 Radioprotector from Ocimum sanctum produced by the endophyte are biologically active and exhibited significant antioxidant, anticancer and radioprotective properties.

These findings are in line with the molecular docking analysis of phytoligands against Lux S and Pilin receptors. Additionally, pairwise correlation analysis of the tested activities with qualitative, quantitative and bioactivity functional descriptors revealed that an increased content of alkaloid, moderate content of flavonoids and decreased content of tannins supported anti-adhesion, anti-quorum sensing and anti-biofilm potential activities.

The lead combination of PTRC-31911-A + ertapenem or meropenem showed maximum augmentative potential at a dose of 50 and 100 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, with nearly fivefold decrease in minimum inhibitory concentrations as compared with the respective antibiotics alone. The synergistic effects implied that the antibacterial combinations of PTRC-31911-A and ertapenem, meropenem, colistin, tigecycline or augmentin are more effective than monotherapy with either of these antibiotics.

Highest priority opportunistic pathogens like Salmonella species, Brucella abortus, etc. pose a risk to national security as they can be easily disseminated or transmitted from person to person, which can further result in high mortality rates amongst the vulnerable populations. These pathogens in turn also play an important role in the initiation and perpetuation of such inflammatory conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and neurological disorders) in susceptible community. However, the use of biologic therapies (corticosteroids, NSAIDS, DMARDS) is also associated with increased risk of infections with intracellular microorganisms like Salmonella spp., E. coli, etc. (Thakur et al. 2016a,b and Tanwar et al. 2017a,b) . Further, the combination therapy of corticosteroids and conventional drugs like anti-inflammatory drugs (naproxen, aspirin, diclofenac) etc. was shown to have antagonistic effects. Nowadays, the management of inflammatory conditions requires aggressive treatment with existing conventional drugs. Due to an increase in the unwanted effects of such therapeutic modalities, alternative therapies, particularly herbal, need to be explored as a curative remedy for the management of such vulnerable condition in terms of 'worst-case scenario' (Thakur et al. 2016a) . With this aim in mind, endeavours were made to identify and develop natural remedies that could be employed in worst-case scenarios (mainly in susceptible population) to modulate the deleterious effects of natural disease outbreaks or deliberate use of biothreat agents. A herbal informatics evidence-based matrix modelling approach was envisaged, and this unique approach utilized the in silico bioprospection for identification of potent herbal leads. The model was developed using PubMed-based dynamic search engines as interactive platform. The priority index algorithms were used as a basis for evaluation of relevance factor of various physiological targets or bioactivity parameters specific to a particular microorganism(s) or inflammatory condition(s) in conferring antibiotic resistance over a period of time Tanwar et al. 2017a,b) . Similarly, the potential herbals identified the basis of classical bioprospection were subjected to binary, weightage and fuzzy set-based analysis using assigned relevance to each activity parameter as dependent variable. The final optimized matrix provided several potential herbal leads. These identified leads were further carried forward for evaluation of their antimicrobial activity as well as anti-inflammatory potential against a novel standardized 'vulnerable animal model' (collagen type II-induced rheumatoid arthritis in combination with opportunistic infections involving multidrug resistant pathogens as worst-case scenario) (Tanwar et al. 2017a,b) . The identified herbal leads (e.g. Camellia sinensis, Berberis aristata, etc.) could be utilized as novel holistic drugs in the future for the management of biothreats posed, particularly in vulnerable populations.",

Symptomatic dengue virus infection ranges from a self-limited febrile illness and dengue fever to a more severe disease, dengue haemorrhagic fever/ dengue shock syndrome. Medical treatment of dengue poses serious issues as virtually no targeted therapeutic agents are available to treat the disease and consequently whatever treatment is given is mostly supportive in nature. Jain et al. (2008) evaluated the anti-dengue activity of Hippophae rhamnoides leaf extract in dengue virus type II infected blood-derived human macrophages. The dengue virus-infected cells were treated with Hippophae rhamnoides leaf extract and compared with the commercially available antiviral drugribavirin. The extract was able to maintain the cell viability of dengue-infected cells at par with ribavirin, along with the decrease and increase in TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, respectively. Anti-dengue activity of Hippophae rhamnoides extract was further determined by the traditional plaque assay. The results suggested that the Hippophae rhamnoides leaf extract has significant anti-dengue activity and has potential for the treatment of dengue.",

It is well known that the recognition of virus infection by retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG) I and melanoma differentiationassociated protein (MDA) 5, which are RNA helicases, and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) 15 can activate a cascade of signal transduction pathways leading to production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines that synchronize the removal of the virus from the host. However, it has been demonstrated that RNAhelicase-mediated innate immunity plays an important role in defending the host from infection. During endeavours to identify plant-derived antivirals that could selectively enhance ISG-and RNA-helicase-mediated antiviral immune responses, Rhodiola was found to be effective. Rhodiola treatment significantly promoted ISG, RIG-I and MDA 5 gene expression and an antiviral immune response against dengue virus infection. Rhodiola treatment also induced interferon (IFN) \u03b2 and other cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8 in infected cells. Rhodiola also upregulated phosphorylated eIF-2\u03b1, PKR and NF-kB in infected cells. In addition, the number of NK cells was also increased upon treatment with Rhodiola in dengue virus-infected human PBMCs. Based on the studies, Diwaker et al. (2014) demonstrated that Rhodiola induces pharmacological modulation of RIG-I, MDA 5 and ISG signal transduction pathways supporting the induction of a favourable antiviral immune response against dengue virus and, can, therefore, be a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of dengue infection.",

The mostly unprepared individuals get affected almost immediately; the first responders can get accidentally exposed, and the population in the vicinity can get affected rapidly. The specific mode of toxicity of these agents is varied; they are often mediated either directly or indirectly with increased oxidative stress in biological systems. Consequently, a plethora of antioxidants have been explored as potential medical countermeasures for CWA/TIC exposures. In DRDO, studies have been performed with a diverse array of CWAs, model organisms, exposure systems, target organs and antioxidants, looking at an almost equally assorted set of endpoints. Endeavours at treating CWAs/TICs with antioxidants have often met with mixed results, though exploration of antioxidants as medical countermeasures for CWA/TIC management has shown some potential. A plethora of herbal drugs have been utilized for their protective efficacy against chemical warfare agents, including extremely toxic sulphur mustard (SM). Ethanolic extract of Hippophae rhamnoides leaf (HL-EOH), water and ethanolic extract of H. rhamnoides fruit (HF-W and HF-EOH) and H. rhamnoides flavone from fruit (HR-flavone) were evaluated against percutaneously administered sulphur mustard (Vijayaraghavan et al. 2006) . The H. rhamnoides extracts (1 g/kg; 3 doses; po) significantly protected SM-induced lethality. Following percutaneous administration of sulphur mustard, reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione levels decreased, and malondialdehyde was elevated. Oral administration of HL-EOH and HR-flavone significantly protected against loss of body weight. Following oral administration of ethanolic leaf extract and HR-flavone, recovery GSH, GSSG and MDA levels were recorded. The authors concluded that percutaneous administration of sulphur mustard induces oxidative stress, and ethanolic extract of leaf of H. rhamnoides and H. rhamnoides flavone from fruit can significantly protect against sulphur mustard-induced toxicity.",

Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS) has developed a new herbal adjuvant, called DIP-HIP (Fig. 35) , and compared its efficacy to standard adjuvants, viz. complete Freund's adjuvant and alum.",

Upon administration of DIP-HIP, cytokine profile correlates well with the Th1 and Th2 type of immune response. Immunization through different routes like intraperitoneal and intramuscular did not show any significant difference nor caused any muscular damage, granulomatous reaction or dystrophy. The shelf life of DIP-HIP is more than 3 years, whereas in the formulation with antigen, it is about 4 months at 40 C. No haemolytic activity is observed on the treatment of both human and animal erythrocytes with DIP-HIP. Incorporation of DIP-HIP results in Fig. 34 Bio-larvicide for controlling mosquito larvae at the breeding sites enhancing, accelerating and prolonging the antigen specific-antibody responses in animals. Further advantages of DIP-HIP include enhancement of immunogenicity, reduction of antigen amount needed for a successful immunization and reduction of frequency of booster immunization, without any muscular damage or side effects.",

The presence of these fatty acids and total carotenoids (430 ppm) and tocopherol (1175 ppm) imparts potent bioactivities. DIP-LIP has significant hypocholesterolemic activity and inhibits cholesterol deposition in cholesterol-fed animals, besides increasing HDL cholesterol levels. DIP-LIP also exhibits significant vasorelaxant activity in aortic ring model. DIP-LIP also increases resistance to hypoxia and cold stress.

Frequently even systemically administered steroids are not effective. It is a social stigma and is caused mainly due to decreased synthesis of melanin pigment by the skin resulting in white patches and discolouration of the affected areas. The current treatment modalities have not been able to provide any satisfactory solution. Defence Institute of Bioenergy Research (DIBER) has developed a polyherbal topical cream and oral mixture of seven herbs (lukoskin) for curing vitiligo without side effects upon longterm application (Fig. 36) . The combination therapy was found to inhibit reoccurrence of white patches besides preventing blister formation and has no side effects. Lukoskin enhances melanin synthesis, is a non-toxic herbal product and prevents hyper pigmentation and restores normal skin texture.",

DRDO has been making concerted efforts to consolidate and streamline research and development endeavours on herbal products to provide unique solutions to the Armed Forces. In the process, at times some spin-offs emanate, which find practical application in both military and civil setting. With a view to meeting emerging challenges, the traditional knowledge on herbs of high altitudes, desert areas, Central Himalayan and North East region, etc. is being documented, and research carried out to generate scientific data that can be useful for the Armed Forces. There is a paradigm shift towards acceptance of scientifically validated herbals as effective prophylactic and therapeutic agents. The grant of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to discoveries concerning novel therapies for some of the most devastating parasitic diseases, viz. river blindness, lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) and malaria, has once again highlighted the importance that herbal drugs are receiving in today's world. Drugs derived from Streptomyces avermitilis and Artemisia annua were found to be effective against parasitic diseases. However, it is a paradox that in our country, where Ayurveda has been a very successful and effective system of medicine for over 5000 years, there is still some amount of scepticism among civil health experts when it comes to acceptance of herbal drugs, and services are no exception.. This Fig. 38 Seapricot beverage, herbal antioxidant supplement and antihypertensive beverage -Hridayamrith view has to change in coming times if the full benefit of scientifically validated herbal drugs has to reach the users. The realization that herbal drugs are effective and safe and can solve the emerging problems of our Armed Forces will lead to induction of more and more products to the advantage of our soldiers who operate in harsh and extreme terrain and inhospitable operational conditions. As alluded to earlier, serious endeavours are underway in DRDO towards protecting the warfighter and promoting performance through the development of scientifically validated herbal products, processes and technologies. The need of the hour is achieving greater synergy with the services and industrial partners so that the herbal products, technologies and complementary and alternative medicine can be inducted in a rapid manner for the benefit of the soldiers.",
