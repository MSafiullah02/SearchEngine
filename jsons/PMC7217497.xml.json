The theory of complex networks has led to many interesting results in various areas of interdisciplinary science [1]. Recently, the study of multiplex networks has become the new frontier in the area of complex networks [2]. Multiplex networks are proved to describe many real-life systems better, especially when these systems are composed of different but interconnected subnetworks [2\u20135]. Representative examples include the traffic systems with multimodal transportation, and the social networks where individuals can use multiple platforms. In social networks, an individual can use different platforms to communicate with different categories of friends: kinship, vicinity, membership of the same society, colleague in a company, etc. In the spreading of information, people will first select the subgroup of friends that are thought to be interested and then forward the information to the subgroup.",

In the system, each geographical location has different entry points for different transportation media. Traffic dynamics are usually modeled as the flow of elements from origin to destination nodes guided by routing paths [6,7]. The routing strategy and network structure can greatly influence the emergence of congestion [8\u201313]. Many works have been devoted to extend the traffic and spreading dynamics on isolated networks to multiplex networks [14\u201320]. The multiplex structure has been proved to affect the transportation process, such as traffic load distribution, and choice of origin and destination [15,21\u201323]. For example, in the multimodal traffic system, each element can choose the most appropriate media to start and end its travel. If all elements adopt the shortest paths to minimize their travel distance, this \u201cselfish behavior\u201d will provoke an unbalance in the traffic load of the transportation layers and induce counterintuitive congestion [15,23].",

For convenience, we briefly review the main results of epidemic dynamics on networks. As epidemic dynamics is concerned, the structure of a network is vital to the outbreak of an epidemic [24\u201326]. One of the most important findings is the vanished epidemic threshold on scale-free (SF) networks [24,25,27]. The generalization of classical epidemic models [such as the susceptible-infected susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infected recovered] to the multiplex networks has stimulated a great interest. Obviously, one important issue is to relate the epidemic onset of the whole system with those corresponding to the isolated networks. Previous studies have pointed out that an epidemic can be induced in the multiplex system even for infection rates for which a disease would be unable to propagate in each isolated network [19,20,28]. That is, the critical epidemic point of the multiplex network is smaller than any of the isolated layers. The coupled system can sustain an epidemic even when the isolated networks would be free of disease.",

When the epidemic spreading is taking place in a traffic-driven environment, the situation will be more complex. In fact, the outbreak of such an epidemic is mainly dependent on the spreading scope, which is determined by traffic conditions [27,31\u201335]. Due to the distribution of traffic flow among the layers, the relation of the epidemic onset of the whole system with those of the constituent layers is still unclear. In this paper, we study the traffic-driven epidemic problem with a traffic model similar to the multimodal traffic system [15]. By mean-field approximation, we obtain analytical expressions for the epidemic thresholds of the multiplex network. We show that the epidemic threshold of the multiplex network is not always smaller than those of the isolated networks. An appropriate structure of one layer will attract some traffic flow and suppress the epidemic spreading in the whole system. The suppression of an epidemic by a multiplex network will occur when the structure of constitutive layers meets some special requirements. The theoretical analysis provided in this paper can be applied to both homogeneous random multiplex networks and heterogeneous scale-free multiplex networks. The results reveal a profound relation between the outbreak of the epidemic and the multiplex structure.",

(1), the distribution of routing paths (or the corresponding between-ness value) is the main factor that influences the spread of the epidemic. To obtain the epidemic threshold for multiplex networks, we need to first figure out the distribution of shortest paths in the system. Two important parameters have to be found: (i) \u03bb, the fraction of interlayer paths among all shortest paths; (ii) \u03d5l, the fraction of intralayer paths of layer l in all intralayer paths. With these two parameters, we can express the between-ness of each replica approximatively as [15]\n(2)bil\u2248\u03bb\u03d5lbi(l),where bil is the between-ness of the replica of node i in layer l and bi(l) is the corresponding between-ness by treating layer l as a single network. The term \u03bb\u03d5l accounts for the fraction of the shortest paths traversing only layer l. Note that the contribution from the paths that use interlayer edges is ignored. If a particular layer has very dense connections, its original path length is relatively shorter, and there will be no need to migrate its shortest path to other layers. Especially, with the increase in average degree, one can have \u03bb\u22481.0 and bil\u2248\u03d5lbi(l)\n[15].",

            "text": "As an example, consider a multiplex structure composed of two layers A and B with average degrees \u2329k(A)\u232a and \u2329k(B)\u232a. For two layers with the same number of nodes, the layer with more links (or a larger average degree) usually has a smaller average between-ness. From Eq. (1), one can find that the layer will have a larger epidemic threshold. Without loss of generality, we assume that layer B is more efficient in terms of traffic dynamics (i.e., \u2329kA\u232a<\u2329kB\u232a, and \u03b2c(A)<\u03b2c(B)). When forming a multiplex network, since layer B is more efficient, the traffic flow will immigrate from layer A to layer B. Therefore, the epidemic threshold of layer A will increase, whereas the threshold of layer B will decrease. That is as follows:\n(9)\u03b2cA\u2273\u03b2c(A),\n(10)\u03b2cB\u2272\u03b2c(B).As Eq. (8) predicts, the epidemic threshold of multiplex \u03b2c will be the smaller one of \u03b2cA and \u03b2cB,\n(11)\u03b2c=min\u03b2cA,\u03b2cB.For the situation of an epidemic suppressed by the multiplex configuration, the epidemic threshold of the multiplex network should satisfy\n(12)\u03b2c>\u03b2c(A).For this situation, since \u03b2cA will be always greater than \u03b2c(A) [Eq. (9)], the epidemic threshold of the multiplex network should be \u03b2c=\u03b2cB. Thus, we can find the condition for the occurrence of an epidemic suppressed by the multiplex configuration as: \u03b2cB>\u03b2c(A). Using Eqs. (1) and (6) to determine \u03b2c(A) and \u03b2cB, respectively, the condition can be rewritten as\n(13)12\u03bb\u03d5B\u2273\u2329b(A)\u232ab(B)2\u2329b(B)\u232ab(A)2.From this inequation, we will find that a double-layered multiplex structure can produce a larger epidemic threshold than, at least, one individual layer when the condition is meet. This is verified by simulation experiments of multiplex networks composed of two Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi layers. Figure 3 shows the fraction of infected nodes \u03c1 as a function of infected probability \u03b2 for two typical Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi multiplex networks. Figure 3(a) shows a special result that the multiplex shows an epidemic threshold between the thresholds of its single layers, whereas Fig. 3(b) shows a normal result of epidemic induced by the multiplex structure.\n",

However, for the region of comparatively different average degrees (upper and right edge), the probability of observing an epidemic suppressed by multiplex structure is very low. The reason of this phenomenon is also the redistribution of traffic flow among the layers. When one layer is far more efficient than the other layers, the traffic flow will immigrate to the layer, and eventually induce an epidemic outbreak in the layer.",

In fact, this phenomenon can be observed in other multiplex network structures. Here, we demonstrate the suppression of a traffic-driven epidemic on SF multiplex networks, which is more appropriate to represent real-life communication systems. We construct each layer by the uncorrelated configuration model (UCM) [37,38]. The rules of the UCM proceed as follows: (1) In a set of N initially disconnected nodes, assign each node i a degree ki sampled from the power-law distribution P(k)\u223ck\u2212\u03b3 with the constraints kmin\u2264ki\u2264kmax (normally kmax=N); (2) randomly connect nodes by the preassigned degrees, and multiple and self-connections are forbidden. One can see that the parameters controlling the structure of the UCM SF networks are kmin and \u03b3. Here, we fix \u03b3=2.8,N=1000, and adjust kmin as a variable to control the layer structure. Furthermore, since the system used here is relatively small, the hubs could dominate the structure of the network as well as the distribution of the traffic load. So, we add a constraint kmax=min(kmin+10,N) to distinguish layers with different kmin's. With the increase in the system size, this constraint can be relaxed. However, that might be computationally expensive.",

Equation (13) can work well in predicting the boundaries of regions. With SF networks, the approximation of \u03bb\u22481.0 is no longer valid. Therefore, the prediction of Eq.
