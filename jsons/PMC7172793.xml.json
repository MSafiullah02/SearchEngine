            "text": "The success of commercial dairies depends on a reliable supply of healthy replacement heifer calves with good genetic potential for milk production. Several management practices have been recommended to producers for reducing the frequency of calf morbidity and mortality on dairy farms. One area commonly emphasized is the calving pen. The management of calving pens influences the degree of early calf exposure to infectious environmental pathogens (Smith et al., 1989). The associations between calving site and incidence of calf morbidity have been previously identified in several studies. In one observational study of 25 New York herds, calves born in herds using calving pens were less likely to develop diarrhea than those born in herds using stanchions or loose housing areas for calving cows (Curtis et al., 1988b). Svensson et al. (2003) while studying the health of 3081 heifer calves from 122 dairy herds in southwest Sweden reported that calves born in herds using single cow calving pens were at lower risk of respiratory disease than those born in herds using cubicles or group calving pens. In Michigan herds with between 50 and 99 adult cows, the use of single cow calving pens and removal of bedding from these pens between calvings were associated with a lower incidence of diarrhea (Frank and Kaneene, 1993). Waltner-Toews et al. (1986c) reported that calves born in calving pens had a lower overall mortality rate compared to those born in unusual or unexpected sites on the farm. Consequently, single cow calving pens which are cleaned after each use have been recommended to farmers as a management tool with the potential for reducing early exposure of heifer calves to environmental pathogens (e.g. Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis [MAP], Escherichia coli, Salmonella species) at the time of calving (Rossiter and Hansen, 2000). However, the effectiveness of this management tool with respect to calf disease prevention has not been evaluated using controlled field studies.",

A further criterion for herd inclusion was evidence for the endemic presence of Johne's disease (JD) in the herd. This evidence was initially ascertained based on a history of culling due to JD during the year prior to the start of the study and past serological test records for MAP, although herd screening testing to determine herd infection status was later undertaken. The requirement for JD infection was due to the fact that the long-term objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of single cow calving pens (vs. multiple cow calving pens) for prevention of transmission of MAP in Holstein calves. Prior to the start of this study, producers were asked to provide detailed information regarding their general calf management programs (e.g. nutrition, calfhood disease prevention measures and housing), average rolling herd milk production, herd size (number of lactating cows), and bulk tank somatic cell counts.",

In the present study, all herds housed calves in calf hutches until weaning. In addition all pregnant heifers and cows were vaccinated 3 months prior to actual calving to protect the yet to be born calves against calf diarrhea using a multiple antigen vaccine (GUARDIAN\u00ae, Schering-Plough Animal Health Corp., Omaha, NE). The effective control of calf diseases is a multifactorial function of several factors including the reduction of degree of exposure of newborn calves to putative risk factors (infectious agents inclusive), increasing levels of specific and nonspecific immunity resulting from provision of adequate colostrum, good nutrition, minimizing stressors and increasing specific resistance by vaccinating either the dams or newborn calves against specific pathogens (Radostits et al., 1994, Davis and Drackley, 1998). The calves in the present study were bottle fed approximately 3.8 L of raw colostrum collected from their respective dams within the first 6 h of birth. Since the farms in the present study already had many of these management practices in place to reduce exposure of calves to risk factors of disease and to enhance specific resistance to calf diseases (diarrhea or scours), it is not surprising that a possible effect of single cow calving pens if present was less obvious.",

Consequently, calves born in single cow calving pens one week prior to removal of bedding straw may have had a similar risk of exposure to environmental pathogens as those born in the multiple cow calving pens with compromised hygiene conditions. It is also possible that calves born in the single cow calving pens one week prior to removal of bedding may have had greater risk of exposure to environmental pathogens than those born in the first week of the month following complete replacement of bedding material. These may have biased study findings towards the null although the authors were unable to verify the existence of this potentially serious source of bias. It should be noted that although in the authors\u2019 opinion, the ideal single cow calving pen management practice after each calving should involve complete removal of feces, placental remains, and bedding materials from the calving site, followed by disinfection of the floors with an appropriate disinfectant and placing fresh bedding material prior to introducing the next pregnant heifer or cow, this ideal program is less likely to be popular among many producers because of the potential costs (cost of bedding straw and labor for cleansing of the pens) associated with its implementation. The single cow calving pen cleaning protocol used in this study seem pragmatic and potentially adoptable by many producers despite the fact that once in a month removal of bedding has the potential of compromising hygiene of the single cow calving pens in the long run.",

For example, while all calves in this study were bottle fed approximately 3.8 L of raw colostrum collected from their respective dams within the first 6 h of birth, the investigators did not collect blood samples from each enrolled calf to evaluate the passive transfer of serum IgG and total proteins between treatment and control groups of calves. It seems reasonable to hypothesize that calves born in single cow calving pens might experience lower failure of passive transfer rates (FPT) (FPT = a calf serum IgG level <10 g/L within 24 h of birth) in comparison to calves born in multiple cow calving pens, as the former group may have had less opportunity to potentially suckle alien cows that may have already been suckled, thus offering colostrum of inferior quality, although the converse might also be true. Another possible limitation of the current study is the fact that diagnosis of calf disease events by the calf mangers may have introduced misclassification of disease status bias, effectively driving the treatment effect estimates towards the null. The authors are however confident that this potential bias was limited because the calf managers were masked to the group (treatment vs. control) to which the calves were assigned at time of enrollment. Additionally calf mangers were trained about the calf diseases of interest prior to the study onset, thus reducing the possibility of subjective assessments of the outcomes. Though no confirmatory diagnoses by a herd veterinarian was required for the purpose of this study, the author validated the farmer recorded diagnoses using the veterinarians\u2019 treatment records at each biweekly farm visit.

Additionally, the effect of treatment (single cows calving pens vs. multiple cow calving pens) on other outcomes including FPT rates, number of treatments or sick calf days, mortality, growth rates, and still birth risks should be explored in future studies. In spite of these findings, the authors do not recommend discontinuing the use of single cow calving pens in herds that are currently utilizing them since calves born in multiple cow calving pens might still be at greater risk of acquiring other infections (e.g. MAP).
