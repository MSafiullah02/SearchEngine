These modulators are often small synthetic compounds and most act as agonists and to a much lesser extent as antagonists. Some of them have reached preclinical and clinical trials, and only one has been approved by the FDA and EMA, imiquimod. The key to the success of these modulators probably lies in their combination with other therapies as recently demonstrated.

IRAK4 phosphorylates and activates IRAK1. After phosphorylation of IRAK4 and IRAK1, these two kinases dissociate from MyD88 and interact with TRAF6 with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. TRAF6, together with the ubiquitin E3: UBC13 and UEV1A conjugation enzyme, favor the lysine-related polyubiquitination of TRAF6 itself and the TAK1 protein kinase complex [41] . The latter is a member of the MAPKKK family and forms a complex with the regulatory subunits TAB1, TAB2 and TAB3 that will interact with the TRAF6-generated polyubiquitin chains to allow activation of TAK1 [41] . TAK1 then activates two signaling pathways: NF-kb and MAPK pathways. The IKK complex is composed of two catalytic subunits: IKKa and IKKb and a regulatory subunit NEMO (or IKKg). TAK1 binds to the IKK complex via ubiquitin chains, allowing it to phosphorylate and activate IKKb. The IKK complex phosphorylates the inhibitory protein of NF-kb: Ikba, which will undergo degradation in the cytoplasm, thus allowing NF-kb to translocate to the nucleus to induce the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. In addition, TAK1 also activates members of the MAPKs family such as ERK1/2, p38 and JNK, which mediate the activation of the AP-1 transcription factor, responsible for the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFNb (Fig. 2) [42, 43] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 279, "end": 283, "text": "[39,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 284, "end": 287, "text": "40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 644, "end": 648, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 857, "end": 861, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1596, "end": 1600, "text": "[42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1601, "end": 1604, "text": "43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1587, "end": 1595, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Composition and signaling pathways"}, {"text": "Moreover, Ito et al. showed in 2002 that TLR7 is expressed in myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells.

TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 induce antiviral responses by the production of IFNa as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines. These three receptors use the MyD88 adapter protein to initiate the signaling pathways.

Although GS-9620 was inactive against HIV in purified CD4 \u00fe T cells and macrophages, HIV replication was potently inhibited by conditioned medium derived from GS-9620-treated pDC cultures when added to CD4 \u00fe T cells prior to infection. GS-9620-treated PBMCs primarily showed increased production of IFN-a, and cotreatment with IFN-a-blocking antibodies reversed the HIV-1-inhibitory effect of GS-9620. Supplementary studies demonstrated that GS-9620 inhibited a post-entry event in HIV replication at a step coincident with or prior to reverse transcription. GS-9620 induced phagocytic cell maturation and improved effector-mediated killing of HIV-infected CD4 T cells by the HIV envelope-specific broadly neutralizing antibody PGT121. All data show that the compound enhanced antibody-mediated clearance of HIV-infected cells by improving immune effector functions targeting specifically those cells. GS-9620 is under clinical evaluation for reducing latent reservoirs in virally suppressed HIV-infected patients. The viral reservoir in latently infected cells is responsible for viral rebound in the vast majority of HIV-1-infected individuals who stop taking antiretroviral therapy. The key challenge to cure for HIV-1 infection is represented by the more extensively studied therapeutic strategies known as \"Shock and kill\". These strategies are aimed toward the reactivation of the latent reservoir using a latency-reversal agent (LRA) with the subsequent killing of the reactivated cell either by the cytotoxic arm of the immune system, including NK and CD8 T cells, or by viral cytopathic mechanisms [155, 156] . Borducchi et al. show that administration of the V3 glycan-dependent bNAb PGT121 together with GS-9620 during ART delayed viral rebound following discontinuation of ART in simianehuman immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-SF162P3infected rhesus monkeys in which ART was initiated during early acute infection [157] .

The pharmacokinetic profile of 52a1 in mice confirmed the low systemic exposure. In addition, 52a1 showed low plasma protein binding (30% bound in mice plasma), no inhibition of major CYP450 isozymes (CYP450 > 10 mM: 3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19) and lacked off-target activity across a multi-receptors panel (>10 mM against histamine, dopamine, and serotonin subtypes). SC1 (36, also known as Pluripotin, Fig. 18 ), a TLR7 agonist, is an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1, MAPK3) and RasGAP with Kd values of 98 nM and 212 nM respectively. It maintains embryonic stem cell self-renewal in the absence of feeder cells and exogenous factors. Long-term SC1-expanded murine embryonic stem cells can be differentiated into cells of the three primary germ layers in vitro and also can generate chimeric mice and contribute to the germ line in vivo [161] . Intravenously administered SC1 mediates systemic release of type I IFN, but not of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa and IL6, and results in activation of circulating immune cells. Intratumoral CD8 \u00fe T cells and CD11b \u00fe are significantly increased, pDCs are strongly activated and macrophages are M1 phenotype polarized, whereas myeloid-derived suppressor cells are decreased. SC1 prevents spontaneous lung metastasis, retards tumor growth, results in tumor rejection, prolongs survival and, most importantly, protects from tumor rechallenge, as demonstrated by Vascotto et al. in melanoma and colorectal cancer tumor models. SC1 treatment of mice inhibits the growth of established syngeneic tumors and results in significantly prolonged survival. Tumor-free mice treated with SC1 are protected from subsequent tumor rechallenge [162, 163] . SC1 is also efficient in preventing lung metastases in a pulmonary metastatic Renca model [164] . Mice bearing the NK cellsensitive lymphoma RMA-S are cured by repeated s. c. SC1 administrations as efficiently as with resiquimod. No relevant toxicities were observed. Mechanistically, SC1 reverses NK cell anergy and restores NK cell-mediated tumor cell killing in an IFNdependent manner [165] . SC-2 (unpublished structure) is a dualspecific TLRs 7/8 agonist which displays a more pronounced proinflammatory cytokines release than SC-1.

Fig. 19 ) is a selective and potent benzazepine small molecule agonist of TLR 8 with EC 50 of 100 nM and displays 50-fold selectivity over TLR7. By coordinated activation of TLR8 and NLRP3, VTX-2337 activates NK cells and augments ADCC [166, 167] . When treated with VTX-2337, TLR8 stimulates TNF-a and IL-12 production at lower concentrations in human PBMCs. It also induces TNF-a and IL-12 secretion from monocytes and myeloid DCs through the NF-kB pathway. IFNg secretion was observed when NK cells were treated with VTX-2337, which can enhance the lytic capability and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of NK cells. VTX-2337 also improves the efficacy of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in treatment of ovarian cancer in a mouse model with humanized immune system that has been reconstituted with human CD34 \u00fe cells. This compound is evaluated for treatment of a variety of cancers, including head and neck cancer, colorectal, pancreatic, melanoma, breast, renal cell carcinoma, non smallecell lung carcinoma, and other solid neoplasms. Evaluated as a stand-alone drug for treatment of lymphoma, VTX-2337 was essentially used in combination with other drugs [166, 168] . Thanks to its potential immunostimulating and anticancer activities, VTX-2337 is currently under clinical development as an immunotherapy for multiple oncology indications such as ovarian cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [169] .

They showed that TLR7-deficient mice were not able to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines following stimulation with imiquimod and resiquimod. Once bound to its TLR7 receptor, imiquimod triggers a Myd88dependent signaling pathway that drives activation of NF-kB. Once activated, NF-kB migrates into the nucleus and induces the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines: TNFa, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12 as well as IFNa. The consequence of this effect is a marked stimulation of the immune response against infected and tumor cells [182] . The effect of imiquimod was also demonstrated by skin recruitment and activation of pDCs [183] . In addition, topically applied imiquimod induces the maturation of epidermal Langerhans cells in vivo and stimulates the migration of these antigen-presenting cells to the lymph nodes where they induce a specific T-cell response [184] . In addition, imiquimod can also enhance adaptive immunity by indirectly stimulating the production of IFNg, a cytokine involved in a Th1 response [185, 186] . At high concentrations, imiquimod induces apoptosis of tumor cells via the activation of Bcl-2 proteins and the caspase family [187] . Besides FDA approved indications, topical imiquimod has been used in the treatment of several infectious skin disorders (nonanagenital cutaneous warts [188] , Molluscum Contagiosum [189] , cutaneous leishmaniasis [190] , etc.), neoplastic (fungoid mycosis [191] , vascular tumors [192] , cutaneous metastases [193] , etc.) and other disorders such as ring granuloma [194] , primary follicular mucinosis [195] .

In 2001, resiquimod was considered as potential anti-HSV-2 treatment but due to a lack of efficacy in clinical trials, its development in this indication was stopped [211, 212] . Nevertheless, this compound proved to be effective in the treatment of actinic keratosis. At skin level, the target cells of resiquimod are mainly monocytes and dendritic cells. PDCs express TLR7 and TLR9, while MDCs express TLRs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8, therefore resiquimod by stimulating both TLR 7 and TLR 8 can induce a strong cytokine response including type-I IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may explain the antitumor effect of resiquimod in skin cancer [213] . In basal cell carcinomas (BCC) tumor cells, imiquimod showed direct and independent of death receptor binding pro-apoptotic activity. This activity was also observed with resiquimod, however, to a much smaller extent compared with imiquimod [214] . Resiquimod can indirectly provoke an apoptosis induction in tumor cells by inducing the expression of TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) on dendritic cells and thus increasing their cytotoxic potency [215, 216] . In 2015, Rook et al. have shown that topical resiquimod can also improve effector T cell functions in cutaneous Tcell lymphoma and consequently induce regression of the disease [217] . Furthermore, resiquimod has proven to be an effective adjuvant against several diseases as cancer given its ability to induce local activation of immune cells, stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and improve the presentation of antigen by dendritic cells leading to the activation of cellular immune responses like CD8 \u00fe cytotoxic T lymphocytes [212, 218, 219] . Resiquimod is also tested as potent agent in glioma [220] , acute myeloid leukemia [221, 222] [224] . The presence of an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl chain at R 1 position and no substitution at R 2 show good IFN induction in human PBMCs (Fig. 21) . However, the activity is not improved compared to the unsubstituted compound at R 1 . When longer alkyl chains (heptyl or more) or bulkier alkyl substituents (i.e., tert-butyl) are considered at R 1 , the activity is abolished. The activity is also lost when a phenyl group is directly linked to the R 1 position. The substitution by an alkyl group at the R 2 position improves the IFN induction for small chains, butyl bringing the better activity (MEC \u00bc 0.01 mg/mL or 0.05 mg/mL for butyl (40) or pentyl (41) respectively). Phenoxymethyl and benzyl groups at R 2 also increase activity. The amine in C4 position is essential for the activity. All other modifications on this position rule out the IFN production. Overall, a simple substitution on the benzene ring appears to be detrimental since most of the synthesized compounds are not efficient in inducing IFN. However, C7-substituted compounds preserve the activity of the unsubstituted scaffold.

There is a difference in the response immune profile after TLR 7 or TLR8 stimulation [37] . TLR7 responses are characterized by a high production of type I IFNs such as IFNa, which appears to play a major role in autoimmune diseases, while TLR8 stimulates very low levels of IFNa but induces a strong production of other pro-inflammatory cytokines [62, 256, 291] . However, TNFa produced during TLR8 activation may exert proinflammatory effects in autoimmune diseases [292, 293] . TLR8 being stimulated by ribonucleoproteins [294] and TLR8 mRNA overregulated in patients with Sj\u20ac ogren's syndrome [295] indicates a possible role of TLR8 in autoimmune processes. In psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the skin, extracellular RNA forms complexes with the cationic antimicrobial peptide LL37. These complexes are highly protected against degradation of RNAs and have access to the endosomal compartments of pDCs and mDCs. The RNA-LL37 complexes induce the activation of TLR7 in PDCs and trigger IFNa secretion.
