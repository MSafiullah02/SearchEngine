Recent studies suggest that early\u2010life respiratory tract infections could lead to airway obstruction and hyperreactivity,13 and subsequently increased risk of persistent lower lung function and asthma. Also, exposure to microorganisms seems associated with either an increased risk or lower risk of atopic diseases, depending on the type of bacteria, the composition of the microbiome, or both.",

For laboratory proven respiratory tract infections, nasal samples are taken either during symptoms of an acute respiratory tract infection,19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 or at scheduled time points.19, 24, 28 These are mainly analyzed for either human rhinovirus (HRV) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the most common viral pathogens, and more rarely for other viruses, such as adenovirus, coronavirus, or influenza virus. The difference in timing of sampling could potentially lead to biased results, since the prevalence of a virus during an acute respiratory infection is most likely not comparable to the prevalence of a virus during an asymptomatic period. Studies that used physician\u2010diagnosed respiratory tract infections in early\u2010life as outcomes used either questionnaires or standardized registries. Some prospective cohort studies used questionnaires in which parents were asked whether their child has had a specific infection in a specific period of time.29, 30, 31 Alternatively, studies use ICD\u2010codes or hospital (admission) registries to identify children with respiratory tract infections.32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37 Such differences in definitions could lead to differences in effect sizes, which is also illustrated by a cohort study that compared RSV infections in children that visited the outpatient clinic, the emergency department or who were hospitalized34 in relation to asthma diagnosis. Children with RSV infections in these three different clinical groups had a 1.86\u2010, 2.41\u2010, and 2.82\u2010fold increased risk for asthma, respectively, compared with children without a hospital visit for RSV infections. This is in line with another retrospective cohort study that showed that children with RSV infections who were at the outpatient clinic or prolonged hospitalized had a 1.38 versus 2.5921 increased odds for recurrent wheeze at the age of 5 years, respectively, compared with those without an RSV infection. The use of questionnaires or registries has the advantage of easily accessible data at relatively low cost, but could possibly lead to misclassification. Viral sampling is more reliable in terms of accurate diagnosis, but whether sampling during symptoms of an acute respiratory tract infection is comparable to sampling at scheduled times is unclear. Additionally, costs will be higher and logistics are more complex. Thus, in large observational population\u2010based cohort studies, questionnaires or registries are cost\u2010effective methods to assess respiratory tract infections, while smaller studies using viral sampling provide information on specific agents.",

However, these latter associations seemed only present when the child had allergic sensitization before the age of 2 years.41, 42 It has also been suggested that the number of respiratory tract infections, rather than a specific infection, is associated with an increased risk of asthma.43 Thus, it might be that individual and type of respiratory infections are less important for the development of preschool wheezing or childhood asthma than groups and number of respiratory tract infections.",

Both demonstrated that compared with the placebo, palivizumab decreased the risk of later wheezing, either in the first year of life46 or at the age of 2\u20105 years.47 However, some studies that measured early\u2010life lung function suggest the opposite direction of causality. One prospective cohort study showed that increased bronchial responsiveness in infancy was associated with increased risk of severe bronchiolitis48 and another showed that children with a lower respiratory system compliance, and higher resistance at the age of 2 months, were at greater risk for hospitalization for an RSV infection and wheeze after the infection.49 However, the latter study group demonstrated that the association of HRV in the first year of life with wheezing at the age of 4 years remained significant after adjusting for lung function measurements at the age of 2 months.28 Additionally, another cohort study demonstrated that lower respiratory tract infections in the first year of life were associated with an increased respiratory rate at 1 year of age, and that recurrent lower respiratory tract infections were associated with a lower tidal volume and increased lung clearance index, irrespective of lung function measured at the age of 6 weeks.50 To examine the direction of causality, further longitudinal studies with detailed information on respiratory tract infections and lung function measures early and later in life are urgently needed to provide more insight in the causal direction of these associations.",

Other than respiratory illness, exposure to pets, daycare attendance, siblings, and antibiotic use in the 4 weeks prior to sampling were associated with nasopharyngeal colonization, showing mostly higher rates of Haemophilus and Moraxella colonization. Additionally, a prospective cohort study collected samples of the hypopharyngeal microbiome at the age of 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months, and showed that the microbiome at the age of 1 week represented over 60% of the microbiome at 3 months.56 Thus, although various factors can influence the airway microbiome, it is also likely that the microbiome formation in later life is determined by early colonization.",

Other bacteria, such as bifobacteria, B. fragilis species, E. coli, and lactobacilli were not associated with recurrent wheeze. A birth cohort study characterized the bacterial composition at the age of 1 month and 6 months within three distinct groups.54 The group with a lower abundance of bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus, but a higher abundance of fungi such as Candida had the highest risk of asthma, predominantly multisensitized atopy at the age of 2 years, and asthma at the age of 4 years. No difference was observed between the three groups in the risk of atopy at the age of 2 years, defined as an IgE level above 0.35 IU mL\u22121. A comparison of stool samples at the age of 4 years between non\u2010wheeze, non\u2010sensitized controls, and wheezy\u2010sensitized cases showed no difference in the microbiome composition.63 Both a prospective cohort and a substudy of an RCT showed that the gut microbiome until the age of 1 month is also associated with asthma development at the age of 6 or 7 years.64, 65 The microbiome at the age of 12 months however was not associated with asthma.

Antibiotic use could be related to both the associations of respiratory tract infections with wheezing, asthma, and lung function, and to the associations of the microbiome with these outcomes. Respiratory tract infections could lead to increased antibiotic use, which thereby has as an intermediate effect on wheezing, asthma, and lung function.74, 75 The use of antibiotics could also have an effect on the composition of the gut microbiome, and therefore act as a confounder in the associations of the microbiome with asthma or wheezing.76, 77, 78 Confounding by indication or reverse causation can complicate studies on the effect of the microbiome. For example, it has been suggested that the use of antibiotics is a results of confounding by indication, meaning that only respiratory tract infections themselves have an effect on wheezing, asthma, and lung function, and that a observed adverse effect of antibiotic use on these outcomes is solely because of the direct relation between the use of antibiotics and respiratory tract infections.75\n",

The 17q21 locus, the strongest known susceptibility locus for asthma, was demonstrated to be associated with HRV wheezing in early life as well, but not with RSV wheezing illness.79 Similarly, CDHR3 gene variation increases risk of childhood asthma with severe exacerbations,80 with an increased susceptibility to rhinovirus C infections as a possible underlying mechanism.81 Genetic differences in immune response to infections are also of interest. Some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified to be associated with respiratory tract infections and asthma or airway hyperreactivity, including picornavirus with atopic asthma and airway hyperreactivity, and RSV with atopic asthma and airway hyperreactivity.82 A cohort study of children with RSV demonstrated that genes coding for the Interleukin (IL) pathway, specifically IL4 which might promote allergic inflammation and asthma, are associated with both RSV infection and wheezing, suggesting a potential role for genetic differences in immune responses to infections.83 The immune system could also be an explaining factor in the associations of the microbiome with asthma and wheezing. The gut\u2010associated lymphoid tissue is an important factor in the immune system, and plays a role in the development of the gastro\u2010intestinal immune system.84 Additionally, the birth cohort study that demonstrated that one of three distinct groups of bacterial composition of the gut microbiome was associated with a higher risk of asthma and atopy, also showed that this same group was associated with CD4+ cell dysfunction. Specifically, CD4+IL4+ cells are upregulated, as is the concentration of IL\u20104 released, which could contribute to airway inflammation.54 This could possibly mean that the risk of asthma and wheezing due to differences in the gut microbiome might be mediated by differences in the immune system. The immune system could be a true underlying causal factor in these associations, meaning that the immune system could influence both the risk of respiratory tract infections or alter the microbiome, and influence the risk of wheezing, asthma, and lung function separately. Alternatively, the immune system might be a mediating factor in the association of respiratory tract infections or the microbiome with wheezing, asthma, and lung function.

Studies on this subject, as well as the role of fungi alone, are scarce and should be addressed in future studies. Also, contamination of lower respiratory tract sampling with bacteria from the upper respiratory tract remains a problem.
