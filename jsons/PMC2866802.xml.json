The allergens evaluated by means of skin prick testing were Alternaria species, tree fluid, Cladosporium species, grass mix, Aspergillus species, ragweed, Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, weed mix, dog dander, cat dander, and cockroach (Greer Laboratories, Lenoir, NC). In addition, allergen-specific IgE levels to D farinae, D pteronyssinus, cat, dog, Alternaria species, ragweed, silver birch, timothy grass, cockroach, egg, and peanut were measured (ImmunoCAP FEIA, Phadia).",

Although other viruses were detected, HRV made up the vast majority of viruses detected during April and September, and up to 18 viral strains were detected in a single month in the Madison, Wisconsin, area. The specific strains of HRV differed dramatically from season to season and year to year, with relatively few strains carried over. This study adds new information about patterns of the different species of rhinovirus, including the newly defined HRV-C. One of the unique features of this study is that we evaluated children with asthma during peak cold seasons irrespective of whether they were having asthma symptoms, cold symptoms, or both. As expected, HRV infections were major contributors to cold and asthma symptoms; however, correlations between viral infections and illness were not absolute. Clearly, nonviral factors also contributed to upper and lower airway symptoms in these children, and many infections (24%) were asymptomatic. Comparison of viral with nonviral illnesses demonstrated that viral illnesses lasted longer, were more severe, and were more likely to be associated with loss of asthma control. Finally, children with allergic sensitization had similar rates of viral infections but significantly increased rates and severity of viral illnesses compared with children who were not sensitized.",

In previous studies of patients with asthma and respiratory symptoms, viral detection was as high as 62% to 88%,1, 3, 10, 11 and during asymptomatic periods, detection ranges from 12% to 44%.1, 10 The relatively high viral detection rate (36% to 50%) in our study is likely a result of our sampling both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients during periods of peak HRV prevalence. It is of particular interest that there was an extensive diversity of HRV strains detected in one community over the 3-year study period. Almost all of the strains detected each season were new (72% to 100%), and no one strain was detected in more than 2 collection periods. These findings are in substantial agreement with early studies of HRV epidemiology that used culture alone to detect HRV strains16, 17 and add new information about patterns of newly defined HRV species. Although the strains varied from season to season and year to year, the species clustered into a pattern: HRV-A in the spring, HRV-B in the fall, and HRV-C in both seasons. This pattern is different than what has been reported in a previous study of hospitalized children with asthma in which HRV-C appeared to predominate in the fall.9 Given the high rate of change, a longer period of evaluation will be needed before any firm conclusions can be reached regarding the seasonality of HRV species.",

In fact, viral detection was not always associated with cold symptoms, asthma symptoms, or both; both symptoms were also found during virus-negative weeks. On the other hand, there was a positive correlation between viral infection and asthma symptom severity. In addition, we found that viral illnesses were more severe, with longer durations of cold and asthma symptoms and more loss of asthma control compared with that seen with nonviral illnesses.

Furthermore, the nonsensitized children were more likely to experience asymptomatic infections. This would not have been apparent without routine sampling of nasal secretions. The results are consistent with observations in previous studies that have suggested that sensitization to aeroallergens is a significant risk factor and might be critical for severe viral illnesses.10, 11, 18, 19 Furthermore, it has also been suggested that sensitization and allergen exposure or viral infection alone do not act as independent risk factors for an asthma hospitalization; rather, they only increase the risk in combination.18 Because there are currently no effective antiviral treatments for common cold viruses, there is a need for clinical studies to determine whether controlling allergic inflammation is an effective strategy for reducing the risk of severe virus-induced asthma symptoms in allergic subjects.",

Of the many HRV strains moving through a community in any given month, many strains were associated with loss of asthma control, including the newly discovered HRV-C species viruses. Additional studies are needed to determine whether there are specific characteristics of these viruses that promote wheezing and acute asthma. These data also show that respiratory tract illnesses associated with viruses are more severe and of longer duration and provide further evidence of interactions between allergy and virus-induced respiratory morbidity. Understanding the mechanisms for these interactions might be the key to designing novel and more effective treatments or preventive strategies for virus-induced exacerbations of asthma.Clinical implicationsThe combination of viral infection and allergy increases the morbidity of respiratory tract illnesses in children with asthma.\n",
