To mediate local inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-6 play important roles in activating inflammatory cells like neutrophils, macrophages, and monocytes. Activated leukocytes secrete at least 15 different low-molecular-weight cytokines and also trigger acute-phase response through the manifestation of fever and leukocytosis, increased synthesis of adrenocorticotropic hormones, and production of various acute-phase proteins.Acute-phase proteins are synthesized by the liver under the influence of some cytokines, which flow through the bloodstream, reach the site of inflammation, and remove the pathogens through opsonization and activating the complement pathways.The changes in the serum concentrations of negative and positive acute-phase proteins are due to the altered synthesis from the liver. Three of the best renowned acute-phase proteins are C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, and haptoglobin. Some disease statuses are actually correlated to the concentration of acute-phase proteins.C-reactive protein activates complement pathways and has a major role in some forms of tissue alteration like in cardiac infarction.Diagnostic routine tests are sometimes invasive. For the care of patients, the employment of noninvasive biomarkers is needed. The new biological markers are thereafter the serologic markers and acute-phase proteins.Molecular biological tools have revolutionized the field of the biomarker. For the development of biomarkers, genomics and proteomics are used. To understand the pathophysiology of a disease, the most available technique is correlating serologic markers with clinical phenotypes and genotypes.\n",

The causative agent is diluted, destroyed, or isolated and a sequential cascade of molecular events is set that leads to repairing, healing, and reconstituting the damaged tissue (Li et al. 2007; Iwalewa et al. 2007; Libby 2007; Delves et al. 2006; Goldsby et al. 2007; Guyton and Hall 2001). It is thoroughly characterized by the reaction in tissues and its microcirculation as clinically reflected by redness (erythema), heat (hyperemia), swelling (exudation), pain (through nerves and chemical mediators), and loss of function (pain). Pathologically, it takes place by vasoconstriction followed by vasodilation, hyperemia, stasis, accumulation of leukocytes, exudation of fluid, and finally deposition of fibrin. The combined vascular and cellular inflammatory responses are triggered by inflammatory stimulus and mediated through chemical factors derived from some cells or blood plasma. Even the injured or dead tissues release mediators (Li et al. 2007; Iwalewa et al. 2007; Libby 2007; Delves et al. 2006; Goldsby et al. 2007; Guyton and Hall 2001).",

Inflammation involves the influx of various cells of the host immune system and release of numerous mediators to the site of assault. Assembling and regulating inflammatory responses would be impossible without the concoction of controlled leukocyte population migration, various inflammatory mediators, inflammatory biomarkers (acute or systemic inflammatory marker), and subsequent physiologic changes that carry inflammatory responses (Figs. 4.1 and 4.2). In laboratories, animal models for inflammatory diseases are being developed to understand the process of inflammation, identify inflammatory mediators, and find out their probable role in therapeutics. Currently, there are no specific markers for inflammation; rather some broad-spectrum inflammatory markers were routinely investigated in hospitals. The question we asked is, since the biochemistry of inflammation is known, is it possible to identify some potential biomarkers of inflammation for safe pharmacological treatment which may in the future be helpful for routine hospital diagnosis?\n\n",

Initially it was reported as a mechanism of tissue reaction or response to injury that gave rise to rubor (redness, due to hyperemia), tumor (swelling, due to greater permeability of the microvasculature and leakage of several proteins into the interstitial space), calor (heat, associated with the greater blood flow and the metabolic activity of the cellular inflammatory mediators), and dolor (pain, in part due to alterations in the perivasculature and related nerve endings). The fifth characteristic of inflammation, known as functio laesa (dysfunction of the organs involved), was revealed from the writings of Rudolf Virchow in the 1850s. Then, in the late nineteenth century, Elie Metchnikoff introduced the new concept of phagocytosis, a fundamental attribute of the innate immunity, after studying the engulfment of particulate matter by protozoa and also researching the ingestion of foreign bodies by blood leukocytes. Subsequently, Metchnikoff was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1908, along with Paul Ehrlich, for his work and discovery of humoral immunity, a component of adaptive immunity (Li et al. 2007; Iwalewa et al. 2007; Libby 2007).",

Chemokine activation starts expressing greatly the bound integrin receptors in a high-affinity state for various immunoglobulin ligands on the surface of an endothelial cell. This tightly binds the leukocytes to the endothelial surface. The chemokine gradients stimulate the adhered leukocytes to \u201cmigrate\u201d (or transmigrate) over the endothelium and pass through the basement membrane into the tissue space through the process of diapedesis. The leukocytes start moving through the tissue through \u201cchemotaxis.\u201d Leukocyte cells reach the tissue interstitial space and bind to extracellularly expressed matrix proteins (CD44 and integrins) to prevent their fall from the site. The flow of leukocytes toward the source of inflammation along a chemotactic gradient is mediated by these chemoattractants (Delves et al. 2006).",

Not only anti-inflammatory cytokines but also pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased in the blood and the abnormal condition has been termed as a \u201ccytokine storm.\u201d Sepsis or septic shock syndrome is a systemic response to inflammation during an infection. It is a lethal, severe, and frequently hemodynamic breakdown caused by bacterial endotoxins during gram-negative septicemia. This toxic shock syndrome is mainly seen in younger women due to tampons contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The bacterial exotoxin, TSST-1 (toxic shock syndrome toxin-1; 23.1 kDa), triggers the synthesis of TNF and IL-1. In transgenic mice deficient in expression of CD28, the essential co-stimulatory signals of CD28 has been established in TSST-1-induced toxic shock syndrome. Chiefly due to tissue acidosis, hypoxia, and severe local modifications of metabolism, the characteristic symptoms are hypotension, insufficient tissue perfusion, and uncontrolled bleeding. The end stage of severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome is represented by multiple organ dysfunctions. The massive deterioration of homeostasis during sepsis, also known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, involves mostly the blood vessels along with fibrinolytic, complement, and blood coagulation processes, platelets, the absence or presence of inhibitors, and the kallikrein\u2013kininogen system. Sepsis management according to symptoms is still one of the hard challenging problems faced by clinicians in intensive care patients (Bone et al. 1992; Libby 2007; Delves et al. 2006; Guyton and Hall 2001).",

Acute UC was induced in mice model by inflammatory mediator DSS (4 % DSS for 4 days) as compared to control mice group and colitis groups with pentamidine treatment (0.8 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg). The anti-inflammatory role of pentamidine was evaluated in colonic tissue by evaluating the disease activity index (diarrhea, blood in the feces, animal weight loss); histopathological severity; postmortem evaluation of cyclooxygenase-2, S100B, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and iNOS; p50 and p65 protein expression; phosphorylated-p38, MAP kinase, and myeloperoxidase activity; malondialdehyde synthesis; and macrophage influx in colonic tissues.

The concentrations of soluble OX40L (sOX40L), the vital co-stimulatory signal molecule, increases in asthmatic children and adults and also in many diseases. Pulmonary functions by spirometer and serum concentrations of sOX40L by ELISA were detected in acute asthmatic adult patients as compared to the control group. The patients were graded according to their disease severity into stable, severe, moderate, and mild asthmatic group. In adult asthmatic patients, the serum levels of sOX40L (6.80 \u00b1 4.95 ng/L) were distinctly elevated than that of the control population, and they were negatively associated with pulmonary function indexes. Also, serum concentrations of sOX40L showed prominent differences among severe, moderate, and mild control groups, and its concentrations reduce to the same extent as the control population after therapeutic intervention of the adult asthmatic patients. Thus sOX40L level may act as a possible inflammatory mediator in the pathology of asthma (Lei et al. 2012).",

After the last cerulein injection, the morphological examination of the lung and pancreas and blood and neutrophil infiltration were done along with cytokine expression. NJ4 administration abates the AP severity and lung injury related with AP, reduces neutrophil inflow and cytokine production, and results to in vivo elevated levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Also, NJ4 along with NJ4-2 (another active fraction) induces HO-1 in isolated pancreatic acinar cells and thus prevents the cerulein-triggered death of acinar cells. NJ4 may be a probable therapeutic agent offering defense in AP and might also lower the severity of the disease by stimulating HO-1 expression (Bae et al. 2012).",

Oxidative stress leads to depletion of the most prominent endogenous intracellular antioxidant, tissue glutathione (GSH), but dilapidation of oral GSH by digestive enzymes limits its therapeutic interventions. In chronic renal failure (CRF), GSH repression reduces the oral GSH precursor, F1 (contains cystine as a cysteine carrier), which attenuates oxidative stress and inflammation and restores tissue GSH and thus reduces the severity of interstitial nephropathy. Experimental male Sprague Dawley rats were broken up into CRF (rat chow with 0.7 % adenine) group, F1-treated CRF group (rat chow containing adenine with F1) group, and control group (with regular rat chow). Finally, the animals were given regular chow and then euthanized. Consumption of adenine-containing diet causes rigorous kidney swelling; azotemia; high glomerular and tubular injury; lowered urinary concentrating capacity; massive tubulointerstitial nephropathy; severe anemia; elevated levels of markers of oxidative stress, inflammatory mediators (p-I\u03baB\u03b1, cytoplasmic NF-\u03baB, NF-\u03baB, cyclooxygenase-2, p65), and plasma oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG) 3-nitrotyrosine; and lowered GSH/GSSG ratio and manganese superoxide dismutase. F1 co-treatment caused significantly reduced tubulointerstitial edema and inflammation; higher urinary concentrating capacity, anemia, azotemia; and normalized expression of markers of tissue oxidative and nitrosative stress. Thus, F1 acts as a unique oxidative stress modulator, prominently attenuating inflammation, renal damage, oxidative stress indicators, and renal dysfunction (Nicholas et al. 2012).",

In cerebral ischemia, the primary injury is caused by reduced blood supply and contributed by IL-1\u03b2. IL-1\u03b2 is controlled by the protease caspase-1 and its related inflammasome NLRP3, the activating complex. In macrophages, the in vitro NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent responses require an early priming stimulus by a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) or a pathogen (PAMP). In mouse, in the cultured brain-originated mixed glial cells (DAMP ATP), calcium pyrophosphate dehydrated crystals and monosodium urate had no effect on the expression of IL-1\u03b2 or IL-1\u03b1 and were released when stimulated by PAMP. Alternately, without priming, these DAMPs may trigger inflammation through the synthesis of CXCL1 and IL-6 and cathepsin B (lysosomal protease). Apart from PAMP, the acute-phase protein like serum amyloid A (SAA) may also behave as a priming stimulus. After cerebral ischemia, in vivo, synthesis of IL-1 increased the overproduction of CXCL1 and IL-6 in the ischemic hemispheres of IL-1\u03b1/\u03b2 double KO mice though in these mice injury-induced cytokine responses were not abated. Thus DAMPs enhance brain inflammation by directly stimulating production of glia-originated inflammatory mediators and IL-1-dependent responses (Savage et al. 2012).",

But in vivo experiments performed using animal models having ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury revealed that the binding of CRP to such damaged cells is detrimental to the tissue. Thus, the binding role of CRP with phosphocholine is quite unfavorable if it occurs on injured host cells as it causes more damage to the tissue by stimulating the complement pathway. So, in acute myocardial infarction and ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury, the scenario is worsened by CRP. The consequence of the binding of CRP to damaged cells thoroughly depends on the type of tissue. In tissues like skin and subcutaneous tissue, CRP does not harm to bind the complement and hasten the death of the dead tissue. It is different and harmful to remove dead tissue having no regeneration property. In myocardial infarction, CRP will remove the necrotic part of the myocardium. But, in the ischemic part of the tissue, where the damage can be reversed, CRP may remove the tissue as described previously. Thus, the phosphocholine-binding function of CRP is quite defensive for the host because it leads to removal of necrotic tissue and also protection against pneumococcal infection. On the contrary, the phosphocholine-binding function of CRP is detrimental for the host when CRP binds reversibly to the damaged myocardial cells, as it causes more damage to the tissue by activating the complement pathways (Agrawal et al. 2014).",

Liver injury was triggered in rats by administration of acetaminophen (800 mg/kg, i.p.) followed by administration of fucoidan (extracted from various brown seaweeds, a pharmacological sulfated polysaccharide) 2 h before and after acetaminophen administration. Liver damage and cell death, overexpression of CYP2E1 (metabolizing enzymes of acetaminophen), and hepatic apoptosis (shown by the protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3) induced by acetaminophen were attenuated by co-treatment of fucoidan. Fucoidan acts as an antioxidative agent and increases the production and expression of glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. All of them were reduced by acetaminophen. Further, fucoidan lowered the expression of inflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, iNOS). Thus, against acetaminophen-induced liver injury, fucoidan has hepato-protective effects through the anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory pathways (Hong et al. 2012).",

The disruptive effects of IL-1\u03b2 on endothelial stability in a human in vitro cell model is through binding of MYD88 to small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) signaling and its activator ARF nucleotide-binding site opener (ARNO; also known as CYTH2). It is independent of the NF-k\u03b2 pathway. SecinH3, an inhibitor of ARNO, increases vascular stability significantly in animal models of acute inflammation and inflammatory arthritis (Zhu et al. 2012).",

Inflammatory joint diseases are represented by arthritis with inflammation of the joints, effusion of fluid into the joint cavity, stiffness, swelling, pain, and redness of the skin above the joint. In severe form, it destroys the joint cartilage and underlying bone with irreparable deformities. In ankylosis, the articulating members are adhered resulting in fusion with loss of mobility. In synovitis, inflammation is restricted to the synovial membrane/lining of the joint. Simple pains in the joints with no other accompanying evidence of arthritis are referred to as arthralgias.

The binding of disease-associated CRP to erythrocytes of patients was demonstrated by flow cytometry, Western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation, ELISA, and surface plasmon resonance. A specific and strong RBCMal\u2013CRPMal binding was observed. PC and calcium were found to be crucial for this interaction. Nearly a two- to threefold increase in RBCMal\u2013CRPMal binding as compared to RBCN confirmed disease specificity (Ansar et al. 2006). This binding altered the normal discoid shape of RBCMal with greater hydrophobicity and membrane fluidity. The effector function of CRPMal (10 \u03bcg/ml) has been exhibited by its greater potency to trigger the complement cascade as compared to RBCN. Thus, these studies provide undeviating evidence for a significant phagocytic functional coaction of this acute-phase protein by activating the CRP complement cascade after binding with RBCMal (Ansar et al.\n2006). Deficiencies of the complement-regulatory proteins (CD35, CD55, and CD59) on RBCMal of patients with Plasmodium falciparum were also reportedly known. The role of CRPMal in controlling the complement-regulatory proteins and downstream consequence on the complement cascade has been examined. In the presence of CRP, RBCMal demonstrated lowered complement-regulatory proteins with reduced affinity. These changes cause increased C3 deposition and more complement-mediated hemolysis, thus providing a novel mechanism of complement-fueled RBCMal destruction pathway refractory to erythrophagocytosis, and may account for pathogenesis of anemia (Ansar et al. 2009a).",

Biomarkers provide a powerful and dynamic tool to grasp the spectrum of inflammatory diseases with usage in observational and analytic epidemiology, clinical trials in populations, and screening with diagnosis and prognosis. Biomarkers can also reflect the entire steps of a disease from the earliest symptoms/screening to the terminal stages. Analytical assessment of the validity of biomarkers is required to correlate with respect to the stage of disease. Variability in the measurement of biomarkers ranges from individual error in laboratory technicians, machine dysfunction, improper storage of body fluid, and other bias and confounding issues.",

Diagnosis is mostly based on clinical symptoms combined with radiological, endoscopic, and laboratory investigations. The employment of noninvasive biomarkers is always needed to avoid an invasive diagnostic test that causes discomfort and potential complications. The ability to determine the type, severity, prognosis, and response to therapy of a disease using definite biomarkers has long been a waited goal of clinical researchers. We describe the biomarkers assessed in this chapter, with special reference to acute-phase proteins and serologic markers, and thereafter, we describe the new biological markers (Table 4.2). The biological markers could be developed in the future based on serum markers of acute-phase response. The laboratory tests mostly used to measure the acute-phase proteins in clinical practice are the serum concentration of CRP and the ESR. Other biomarkers of inflammation include platelet count, leukocyte count, and serum albumin and serum orosomucoid concentrations and serologic markers like antibodies also. To detect specific pathologies, in the last decades, serological and immunologic biomarkers have been studied extensively in immunology and have been used in clinical practice. In different diseases, the presence of antibodies can aid as surrogate markers for the aberrant host immune response and also for future biomarkers. The field of the biomarker discovery have revolutionized by the progress of molecular biology tools (microarrays, proteomics, and nanotechnology). The advances in bioinformatics coupled with cross-disciplinary collaborations have highly enriched our ability to characterize, retrieve, and analyze large amounts of data generated by the technological advances. The present techniques available for biomarkers development are proteomics and genomics (single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping, pharmacogenetics, and gene expression analyses). In the future days, the addition of new serological markers will add significant benefit to patients and clinicians. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of a disease is based on correlating serologic markers with clinical phenotypes and genotypes.",

In serious bacterial infection or burns, concentration values may rise to 300 mg/L or even higher. The assessment of disease pathology, diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic applications of CRP in different diseases is already cited (Ansar et al. 2006, 2009a, b; Ansar and Ghosh 2013). Most common inflammatory markers include both inhibitors and mediators of inflammation as well as scavengers of prospective dangerous substances, namely, toxins. The following protein changes are observed during the inflammatory response: a rapid fall in serum prealbumin albumin and transferrin concentration as well as an elevated level of \u03b11- and \u03b12-globulin levels. The selected biomarkers with therapeutic applications of bone disease are CRP, calcitonin, collagen I, collagen I telopeptide, and osteocalcin; for cardiovascular disease, they are aldosterone, angiotensin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, antidiuretic hormone, atrial natriuretic peptide, etc; for diabetes, they are glucagon, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor; for gastrointestinal diseases, they are serotonin, gastrin, somatostatin, etc.; for women\u2019s health, they are estradiol, estrone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, etc.; there are many more biomarkers in other diseases (Sharma et al. 2013; Lazebnik et al. 2013; Testelmans et al. 2013; Cizmeci et al. 2014; Kusnierz-Cabala et al. 2013; Ansar et al. 2006, 2009a, b; Ansar and Ghosh 2013).",

Very soon in hospitals, definite inflammatory markers for each disease will be investigated for routine diagnosis.",

In this pretext, we reviewed some of the immunological mechanisms/processes and the applicability of inflammatory biomarkers that occur during acute phases with its consequent remission/recovery period in some of the widely used experimental models of varied spectrum of diseases (Table 4.2). These diseases are quite common ailments and are posing quite a nuisance not only to global health but also in proving obstructions in its socioeconomic developments. Further research needs to be conducted in the area of genes and molecules involved in causing inflammatory disorders thereby improving the diagnosis and treatment of such diseases. The question we pose here is whether it is possible to screen the biomarkers of inflammation and their levels of expression in diseases associated with inflammation and correlate them with the clinical history. This would offer advantage both from the point of view of diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis of inflammatory disorders. The future scope of this paper remains in identifying such markers for inflammation and its correlation with disease condition.",
