            "text": "Recent studies have provided evolutionary explanations for much of the variation in mortality among human infectious diseases. One gap in this knowledge concerns respiratory tract pathogens transmitted from person to person by direct contact or through environmental contamination. The sit-and-wait hypothesis predicts that virulence should be positively correlated with durability in the external environment because high durability reduces the dependence of transmission on host mobility. Reviewing the epidemiological and medical literature, we confirm this prediction for respiratory tract pathogens of humans. Our results clearly distinguish a highvirulence high-survival group of variola (smallpox) virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Bordetella pertussis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and influenza virus (where all pathogens have a mean percent mortality o0.01 % and mean survival time >10 days) from a low-virulence low-survival group containing ten other pathogens. The correlation between virulence and durability explains three to four times of magnitude of difference in mean percent mortality and mean survival time, using both across-species and phylogenetically controlled analyses. Our findings bear on several areas of active research and public health policy : (1) many pathogens used in the biological control of insects are potential sit-and-wait pathogens as they combine three attributes that are advantageous for pest control : high virulence, long durability after application, and host specificity ; (2) emerging pathogens such as the ' hospital superbug ' methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and potential bioweapons pathogens such as smallpox virus and anthrax that are particularly dangerous can be discerned by quantifying their durability; (3) hospital settings and the AIDS pandemic may provide footholds for emerging sit-and-wait pathogens ; and (4) studies on food-borne and insect pathogens point to future research considering the potential evolutionary trade-offs and genetic linkages between virulence and durability.",

The persistence of high virulence over millennia runs counter to the traditional view that all pathogens should eventually evolve to a state of commensalism with their host (Dubos, 1965; Hoeprich, 1989) . This inconsistency is especially apparent when one considers the rapid rate at which pathogens can evolve. Antibiotic resistance, for example, can evolve dramatically within months (Gezon, Schaberg & Klein, 1973; Mhalu, Mmari & Ijumba, 1979 ; Rowe & Threlfall, 1984; Saunders, 1984) .

The view displacing it proposes that the evolved levels of virulence reflect tradeoffs between counterbalancing selective pressures. Competition among pathogens within individual hosts should generally favour those genotypes that reproduce most rapidly, leading to increased virulence. Requirements for transmission from infected to susceptible hosts provide counterbalancing selection, often favouring relatively benign genotypes. Much of the research during the last 15 years has attempted to determine how different aspects of transmission have influenced the strength of this counterbalancing selection, and, hence, the virulence to which host-pathogen relationships evolve.",

For such pathogens the fitness costs should tend to rise relatively slowly as pathogen reproduction increases. The level of pathogen reproduction at which fitness costs increase faster than fitness benefits therefore should be greater for such pathogens, which should consequently evolve to relatively high levels of virulence (Ewald, 1983) . Statistical analyses of data in the literature on human infectious diseases show that the potential for transmission from immobilized hosts explains much of the existing variation in virulence. Pathogens transmissible from immobilized hosts by arthropod vectors are significantly more lethal than are pathogens that are transmitted directly from person to person (Ewald, 1983) . Similarly, much of the variation in virulence among gastrointestinal bacterial pathogens can be explained by the presence of cultural vectors, which are collections of environmental, biological, and cultural characteristics that transmit pathogens from immobilized infectious hosts (Ewald, 1988 .",

Nonvector-borne pathogens are generally benign, but some, such as the smallpox virus and tuberculosis bacterium, are often lethal. Some of this variation in virulence among nonvector-borne pathogens might be explained by the prevalence of a 'sit-and-wait ' strategy (Ewald, 1987 (Ewald, , 1994 . Like the vector-borne strategy, the sit-and-wait strategy requires mobility of another organism to permit transmission from an immobilized, infected host to a susceptible host ; but instead of relying on the mobility of a vector for transmission, the ' sit-and-wait ' pathogen makes use of the mobility of susceptibles. Pathogens that can survive outside of the host until a new susceptible host contacts them can still be transmitted from immobilized hosts (the differential mobility of infected hosts is crucial to this hypothesis, see Discussion). Because the costs of host immobilization are relatively low for durable pathogens, sit-and-wait transmission should favour evolution towards high levels of virulence (Ewald, 1987 (Ewald, , 1994 . This hypothesis predicts that the duration of pathogen survival outside of the host will be positively correlated with virulence. This study reports the first test of this prediction.",

We define infection broadly to include all people within which the pathogen has multiplied sufficiently to be detectable serologically or by isolation (this definition therefore includes those people who according to a narrower definition of infection may have been considered ' colonized ' rather than 'infected '). Because M/I is rarely presented in the literature, we usually calculated it by multiplying mortality per case (M/C) by cases per infection (C/I). To reduce effects of treatment on M/I, estimates were obtained from data gathered prior to the initiation of effective antibiotic treatment against the pathogen in question (usually a bacterium). To reduce effects of secondary infections by different pathogens on M/I, estimates were obtained for cases with antibiotic treatment against the secondary pathogens whenever such treatment was ineffective against the primary pathogen (usually a virus). If a vaccine is based on the virulence-determining components it should favour evolutionary reductions in virulence (Ewald, 1994 . To quantify M/I for pathogens controlled by such vaccines, we therefore used data gathered just prior to the introduction of these vaccines.",

The dramatic decreases in C/I during this period have been attributed to vaccination, which was introduced during the mid 1920s (Goldstein & Hoeprich, 1977) . The vaccine used a modified version of the diphtheria toxin, which is the key determinant of lethality. By preventing the transmission of toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae to vaccinated individuals, widespread vaccination undoubtedly provided a selective pressure against the toxigenic strains, increasing the relative frequency of non-toxigenic strains (Schuman & Doull, 1940; Stebbins, 1940; Pappenheimer & Gill, 1972 , 1973 Ewald, 1994) , thereby decreasing C/I. These considerations indicate that C/I should be estimated from data obtained prior to the widespread use of vaccination. At the onset of vaccination C/I was about 0.02 (Frost, 1928) . M/I was therefore 0.002 prior to the evolutionary effects of vaccination.",

The mortality per recorded cases of whooping cough decreased steadily in the U.S. from about 0.05 in the 1920s to 0.004 in the 1970s (Brooks & Buchanan, 1970) . This reduction was not a consequence of effective antibiotic treatment against B. pertussis because no effective antibiotic treatment had been put into use during this time. Some of the reduction may be attributable to a preponderance of unreported non-lethal cases, which may have inflated M/C by five-to tenfold early in the 20th century (Luttinger, 1916) . Although the accuracy of reporting improved substantially during the first half of the century, M/C was probably overestimated at least until the mid-century (Gordon & Hood, 1951) . Most of the mortality that occurred during the first half of the century was attributable to secondary infections, which became effectively controlled by antibiotics during the period (Morse, 1977) . We therefore consider the most recent figure from the 1970s mentioned above to be the best indicator of M/C attributable to B. pertussis. Estimates of C/I among the very young average 0.78 (Gordon & Hood, 1951 ; Wilfert, 1988a ; Giammanco et al., 1991) , but about two-thirds of the infections occur after the age of three (Giammanco et al., 1991) .

Combining these carriage frequencies with population estimates from this period (i.e. 1970) (US Bureau of the Census, 1975) yields a total of about 40 million people in the U.S. carrying S. pneumoniae at any given time. Given that the average length of carriage is about 7.5 weeks (mean of estimates given by Heffron, 1939 ; Dowling, Sheehe & Feldman, 1971; Hendley et al., 1975) , the annual number of infections is about 277 million.

Mortality data prior to the 1957 pandemic should tend to overestimate actual M/C attributable to the influenza virus because deaths due to the virus were not distinguished from deaths due to secondary bacterial infections (Stuart Harris, 1961) . Moreover, unusual epidemiological circumstances of the 1918 pandemic may have enhanced virulence to unnaturally high levels (Ewald, 1991a) . During the 1957 pandemic, about 59 300 deaths occurred in the U.S. (Dauer & Serfling, 1961) , about 25% of which can be attributed to viral pneumonia (Stuart Harris, 1961) . These 14 825 virally caused deaths occurred among 70 million cases (Francis & Maassab, 1965) ; thus, M/C is about 0.0002. Estimates for the C/I of influenza vary, but average about 0.5 (Mulder, 1960; Francis & Maassab, 1965; WHO, 1969 ; Davis et al., 1973; Jackson & Muldoon, 1975) , yielding a value of 0.0001 for M/I. Neisseria meningitidis. Prior to effective antibiotic treatment, M/C of meningococcal disease was about 0.5 (Feldman, 1972) . Laboratory surveillance yielded a national incidence in the U.S. of 3100 cases during 1986 (Pinner et al., 1991) ; earlier surveys suggest that this incidence differs little from the incidences during the 1960s and 1970s (Feldman, 1972) . About 7.5% of the U.S. population carries N. meningitidis at any given time ; the median duration of carriage is about 9.6 months (Greenfield, Sheehe & Feldman, 1971 ). Assuming that 9.4% (i.e. 7.5%r12 months/9.6 months) of the 242 million people in the US (US Bureau of the Census, 1991) were infected with N. meningitidis during 1986, a total of 22.7 million infections occurred. Thus, C/I was 0.000137 (i.e. 3100 cases/22.7 million infections). M/I is therefore about 0.00007.",

Therefore, about 16 700 cases of meningitis occurred annually prior to vaccination. On the basis of the percentages given above, a total of approximately 23 560 cases of meningitis, pneumonia, epiglottitis, and bacteremia occurred each year prior to effective vaccination. At any moment in time, about 158.46 million people in the U.S. carry one of the H. influenzae strains. This number is derived by multiplying the U.S. population of 228 million (1980 census, see US Bureau of the Census, 1991) by the average prevalence of all the H. influenzae strains in the population [taking the midpoint of prevalences (called carriage rates in Table 2 of Moxon, 1990) for each strain, average prevalence is 0.695]. Since the mean carriage duration of H. influenzae is 0.2 years (Murphy et al., 1987) , a total of 158.46 million/0.2=792.30 million infections occur annually in the U.S. Thus C/I is 23 560 cases/792.30 million infections=0.0000297.

When researchers disagreed about the precise role of different substrates and routes of transmission, and conclusive proof was lacking, we included all routes and substrates suggested by these researchers. For example, decades of experimental study of rhinovirus transmission have not yet permitted a consensus of the importance of aerosol transmission relative to direct contact with contaminated skin and fomites Gwaltney, Moskalski & Hendley, 1978; Dick et al., 1987 ; Tyrrell, 1992) . Similarly, M. tuberculosis, S. pneumoniae and influenza virus are often categorized as being transmitted primarily by aerosol droplets or droplet nuclei (the residues of dried aerosol droplets; Betts & Douglas, 1990 ; Mufson, 1990 ; Starke, Jacobs & Jereb, 1992) . However, observations and experimentation, especially during the first half of the 20th century, led many experts to incriminate dust and disintegrating sputum as major sources of infection (Otis, 1909; Knopf, 1910 ; Lange, 1926; Augustine, 1929; Loosli et al., 1943; Duguid & Wallace, 1948) . The relative importances of these various routes of air-borne transmission are still uncertain (Grange, 1984) . The experiments completed during the intervening years have supported the importance of droplet nuclei, for at least some respiratory pathogens (Riley, 1982 ; Nardell, 1990 ), but do not address the degree to which air-borne particles of comparable size may be generated from other forms of environmental contamination. Another source of uncertainty stems from the time scale and environmental conditions of the studies. The importance of dust-borne infections, for example, could be vastly underestimated if the pathogen under study survived on dust far longer than the duration of the study, if studies were conducted under relatively dust-free conditions, or if the smallest dust fragments were not represented in the study. Even if transmission occurred solely by droplet nuclei, we presume that survival on surfaces is relevant for pathogens whose aerosol survival has not been measured, because survival on surfaces is probably positively correlated with air-borne survival.",

Similarly, we did not use survival in sun to establish rankings because pathogens typically die rapidly when exposed to direct sunlight and therefore have little opportunity for sit-and-wait transmission. Variations in virulence due to variations in sitand-wait transmission therefore would be more dependent on the much greater variation in survival that occurs in the presence of little or no direct sunlight (e.g. inside houses). experimenters exhausted their supply of virus for assaying viability or terminated their experiments before the viruses became no nviable. Even so, durations of survival are generally greater for variola virus than for C. diphtheriae (Table 2) . When these pathogens were in dried exudate exposed to indirect light, the lower bound of variola survival was greater than the upper bound of C. diphtheriae survival (196 versus 150 days ; Table 2 ). On the basis of these differences, variola virus was ranked above C. diphtheriae with regard to survival in the external environment. C. diphtheriae survived longer than M. tuberculosis on glass (suspension, indirect light), paper and wood (Table 2) . Survival on dust was comparable for the two pathogens (Table 2 ). Therefore C. diphtheriae was ranked above M. tuberculosis.",

But the data from all strains of influenza virus presented in Table 2 suggest that the survival of influenza virus used in those experimental conditions was unrepresentatively short. Lozovskaia (1959) found that survival of influenza virus at approximately 15 xC was consistently greater than that of rubeola when freeze-dried preparations were kept in the dark or exposed to indirect light. Qualitative descriptions suggest that rubeola virus, unlike influenza virus, S. pneumoniae, and B. pertussis, is typically inactivated rapidly when dried on surfaces (Black, 1984) .

Since species are not statistically independent data points because of their shared evolutionary history (Harvey & Pagel, 1991) , comparative methods need to be used to correct for any influence of phylogenetic relatedness on the statistical results. To correct for phylogenetic relatedness, we used the method of generating phylogenetically independent contrasts within an established phylogenetic tree. Such a tree represents the relationships between the investigated species and can thus be used to control for phylogenetic relatedness. We calculated phylogenetically independent contrasts using comparative methods developed by Felsenstein (1985) , Harvey & Pagel (1991) and Pagel (1992) . These methods correct for any influence of phylogenetic relatedness by considering only the evolved difference between related taxa. Specifically, evolutionary change is modelled by a process of Brownian motion along the branches of a phylogenetic tree depicting the relationships of the different taxa. Any species character is assumed to evolve independently along each branch, so that branch lengths can be assumed to represent the expected variance of evolutionary change (Pagel, 1992) . By subtracting character values between related sister taxa and weighing them according to the expected evolutionary change, phylogenetically independent contrasts are generated which can be correlated to test for covariation between changes in different character values. We used the CAIC program (Purvis & Rambaut, 1995) using Pagel's (1992) method to generate 15 independent contrasts within a phylogenetic tree based on recent literature on pathogen phylogenies (Melnick, 1984; Ito et al., 1987; Kawano et al., 1990; Balows et al., 1992) . Branch lengths were set from the topology (Grafen, 1989) . Per cent mortality (Table 3) and durability (measured in days, see below) were transformed using log 10 (1000x+1) prior to the CAIC analysis. The resulting contrasts were analysed with a Model I regression forced through the origin (Grafen, 1989 ; Garland, Harvey & Ives, 1992) .",

The pathogens in our study survive, on the average, 6.4 times longer in dark than in indirect light conditions (mean of nine examples in Table 2 ) and 10.2 times longer on substrates than in aerosols (mean of seven examples in Table 2 ). When comparisons involved survival data under different light or substrate conditions, values from indirect light and from aerosols were multiplied by these correction factors. The mean of all the resultant values was used as the average durability for each pathogen species. Plotting the resulting mean values for each species shows the overall positive correlation described above (Fig. 1) . We then subjected these mean values to the comparative method described above. Again, we found a significant correlation between pathogen-induced mortality and durability (N=15 independent contrasts, F 1,14 =33.91, P<0.0001). Residuals were plotted and found to be normally distributed ; none of the residuals had a Cook's D greater than 4/n and a leverage greater than 3k/n (for discussion of outliers, see Myers, 1990) . Our calculations of mortality may have overestimated the death rate among the mildest group of pathogens because data were insufficient to assess the extent to which death was due to secondary infections. Correction of any overestimates, however, would generate little if any change in the correlation coefficient because these pathogens share the lowest durability rank (Table 3) .",

Even if our estimates of mean per cent mortality and mean survival time may be subject to some uncertainty due to the various methods and sources from which they were collected, such uncertainty cannot explain the three to four times of magnitude of difference in mean per cent mortality and mean survival time which distinguishes the typical sit-and-wait pathogens from the other pathogens. Still, because of the limited number of studies and difficulties inherent in comparing values from studies with different protocols and environmental conditions, we were forced to incorporate a large number of ties in our statistical tests. The cross-specific test could be improved by prospectively evaluating the durability of the pathogens in Table 3 , particularly those that were assigned tied ranks. The variability in durability documented by past studies also draws attention to the need to measure the durability of numerous strains for each pathogen species using identical protocols thus yielding much stronger comparative evidence.",

            "text": "Whenever comparative studies are conducted, cause and effect remain uncertain. One can imagine correlates of durability that might be directly responsible for the variation in mortality and hence for the association between durability and mortality. Perhaps the most feasible alternative hypothesis is the degree of within-host genetic heterogeneity of parasites. Theory predicts that increased genetic variability within hosts should favour evolution of increased virulence (Lewontin, 1970 ; Levin & Pimentel, 1981; Bremermann & Pickering, 1983; Ewald, 1983 ; Bull, 1994; Nowak & May, 1994 ; Frank, 1996) . One might argue that genetic variation within hosts is higher when pathogens are more durable because pathogens that remain viable in the external environment may experience more mixing of different genotypes, yielding more heterogenous inocula. By this argument, genetic heterogeneity within hosts rather than a reduced reliance on host mobility might cause the variation in mortality rates shown in Table 3 . Genetic heterogeneity can arise from many sources, however, such as increased rates of mutations and recombinations and epidemic spread, which might increase the number of sources of infection per infected individual. However, the less mutation-prone DNA viruses in Table 3 do not tend to be less lethal than the RNA viruses. In fact, the smallpox virus is the most deadly virus and one of the least variable. The potential for epidemic spread also shows little if any association with lethality. The smallpox virus, M. tuberculosis, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae have relatively low potential for epidemic spread ; measles, influenza, and rubella viruses have a high potential ; and the rest are characterized by both epidemic and endemic spread (see Mandell, 1990 and also values for the intrinsic reproductive rate of infection, R o , given by Anderson & May, 1982) . Respiratory syncytial virus, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae are characterized by vulnerability to re-infection and therefore ought to be particularly prone to heterogeneity (Mandell, 1990) . Overall, these data suggest that, although this heterogeneity hypothesis needs more direct analysis, the variation in mortality presented in Table 3 does not appear to be associated with either the degree of mutation-induced variation or epidemic-driven heterogeneity.",

This hypothesis is difficult to assess without lethal dose experiments , but given the choice between equal inocula of variola and rhinovirus, we doubt many people would think for too long which one to choose. Another hypothesis suggests that higher virulence evolves in pathogens that are transmitted over longer distances (Boots & Sasaki, 1999) . Again, we cannot assess the importance of this hypothesis with the data at hand, but one should realize that the Boots & Sasaki (1999) hypothesis is really just the reverse of the sit-and-wait hypothesis. They suggest that pathogens that can reach more distant populations should evolve towards higher virulence, while the sit-and-wait hypothesis suggests that those pathogens that can survive for long enough until hosts that used to be 'distant' contact them should also evolve towards higher virulence. In both cases, the more susceptible 'distant' individuals can be infected, the higher the evolved virulence.",

The larger circle denotes two overlying data points. birth and death rates. They concluded that the optimal virulence at equilibrium does not depend on durability, but only on the host's natural death rate and the relationship between the pathogen's virulence and the resulting discharge rate of pathogens from the host. Their model does, however, predict a correlation between durability and virulence if the host-parasite system is in disequilibrium, e.g. during an epidemic. Gandon (1998) extended their model to include the effects of competing pathogen strains and dispersal (see also Frank, 1996) . For most model parameter settings, this model predicts a positive correlation between durability and virulence. However, neither model incorporates the role of host mobility on different routes of transmission. As originally formulated, the sit-and-wait hypothesis is based on the distinction between direct transmission through close contact between infected and susceptible individuals and indirect transmission involving the movement of susceptibles to a place in the external environment where the pathogen lies 'waiting ' (see Introduction). Critical to this distinction is the negative effect of host illness on the frequency of contacting other susceptibles due to decreased mobility of the infected individual or avoidance of infected individuals by susceptible individuals (e.g. Hart, 1997) . This negative effect of illness on host contact results in a hump-shaped transmission coefficient for direct transmission. The models by Bonhoeffer et al. (1996) and Gandon (1998) do not consider this negative effect of host illness, but rather assume a linear relationship between virulence and their coefficients of transmission. To incorporate this effect, Ewald & de Leo (2001) used a humpshaped relationship between virulence and the coefficient of transmission for directly transmitted pathogens in their model. Their conclusion was that pathogens less dependent on host mobility for transmission should evolve towards higher levels of virulence and should also have a higher potential for epidemic spread. This general conclusion should hold for various transmission modes, e.g. waterborne, attendant-borne or sit-and-wait transmission. Given that the ' hump-shaped ' model best explains the variation found in this study and previous studies (Ewald, 1983 (Ewald, , 1988 (Ewald, , 1991b (Ewald, , 1994 (Ewald, , 1995 , the ' hump-shaped ' model has better empirical support than the previous models.",

            "text": "Although this study has tested the sit-and-wait hypothesis using human respiratory pathogens, the same arguments should apply to many other directly transmitted pathogens (Myers & Rothman, 1995) . Highly lethal, directly transmitted pathogens of insects tend to be extremely long-lived in the external environment. One of the most lethal pathogens of the honey bee, for example, is Bacillus larvae which causes American foulbrood disease (Shimanuki, 1990) . Viability of spores in the external environment is at least 40-50 years (Borchert, 1966 ; H. Shimanuki, personal communication contra Bonhoeffer et al., 1996) . B. larvae therefore has a large window of time within which a suitable nest site such as a tree hole can be re-colonized after the pathogenic destruction of the original colony. The nuclear polyhedrosis viruses that infect many different insect species (Payne, 1988) are often sit-and-wait pathogens (Ewald, 1987) ; for example, the nuclear polyhedrosis virus that infects Trichoplusia ni remains viable in soil for at least six years (Tinsley & Entwistle, 1974; Hostetter & Bell, 1985) . It is not surprising that these sit-and-wait pathogens are among the most commonly used biological control agents (Payne, 1988) as they combine three attributes that are advantageous for pest control : high virulence, long durability after application, and host specificity (Anderson & May, 1981; Ewald, 1987) . The sitand-wait hypothesis therefore should be useful in guiding research on and determining appropriate policies for controlling insect pests in agriculture, as well as managing beneficial insects.",

Fulfilling this need is complicated by several factors : the vast number of organisms that can occasionally cause severe disease in humans, most of which cause very restricted outbreaks (e.g. Legionella pneumophila, Lassa Fever virus, Marburg virus), the limited availability of economic resources, and the restricted intervals of time within which decisive interventions may be feasible.

Directly transmitted pathogens pose a relatively great long-term threat if they can remain viable for a long period of time outside of the host.

If the use of antibiotics always provided effective control, these issues would be of limited significance. Existing antibiotics, however, are often of little value against emerging hospital acquired pathogens such as Clostridium dificile and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gallagher & Watanakunakorn, 1989 ; Greenough & Bennett, 1990 ; Hamon-Poupinel et al., 1991 ; Fujita et al., 1992 ; Neu, 1992) . Moreover, the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in hospitals (Gezon, Schaberg & Klein, 1973) raises the possibility that virulent strains may cause substantial mortality before appropriate antibiotics can be found. The 'hospital superbug ' methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA) offers one worrisome illustration (Pavillard et al., 1982; Borg, 2003; Enright, 2003; Melzer et al., 2003) , but M. tuberculosis seems to be even more dangerous. The development of antibiotic resistant M. tuberculosis appears to be a major factor increasing its spread and lethality in institutional environments (Iseman, 1992) .",

They are also naturally resistant to anti-tuberculosis drugs (Wolinsky, 1992) . Should they evolve an enhanced ability to complete infectious cycles among uncompromised hosts we may be confronting a particularly dangerous human pathogen.

After all, if high durability entailed no cost, why would not all pathogens evolve towards high durability and high virulence ? Recent research on food-borne pathogens suggests that not only is durability costly to pathogens, but that durability and virulence may in some cases be genetically linked. To survive environmental stresses such as heat, cold, acid shock, starvation, oxidation or anaerobiosis, food-borne pathogens produce a variety of protective proteins, some of which offer protection to more than one environmental stress (Archer, 1996; Sheridan & McDowell, 1998) . Genes regulating the production of these protective proteins are found in various food-borne pathogens. Moreover, experiments with foodborne pathogens have shown that variation exists among different sub-populations in their ability to survive environmental stresses, and that the more durable pathogens spread in the overall population if environmental stresses persist (Sheridan & McDowell, 1998) . Besides such phenotypic stress responses, higher durability is often achieved by increased mutation rates, and such stress-induced hypermutation may be an adaptation to survive in hostile environments (Archer, 1996; Sheridan & McDowell, 1998) . The same regulatory systems that are used for protective responses apparently also trigger virulence factors inside the host (Archer, 1996; Sheridan & McDowell, 1998) . Mutant bacteria whose protective response to environmental stresses was negatively affected by mutation were also found to be less virulent, suggesting a genetic linkage between durability and virulence in a wide range of pathogens (Archer, 1996 ; Sheridan & McDowell, 1998) .",

Durability in food-borne pathogens may even be enhanced by modern food preservation methods as new food treatments may actually ' stress harden ' pathogens by applying several sublethal stresses intended to slow or inhibit bacterial growth instead of outright killing the bacteria (Archer, 1996; Sheridan & McDowell, 1998) . By allowing food-borne pathogens to mount an adaptive phenotypic and/or genotypic stress response, such food treatments may thus increase both durability and virulence and may lead to the emergence of new highly virulent pathogen strains which can cause disease even at low dosages (Archer, 1996) . Moreover, such durable food-borne pathogens probably have a higher chance of successful transmission to a new host. However, whether food-borne pathogens actually reap the same adaptive benefits from high durability as sit-and-wait pathogens depends on the intricacies of their transmission cycles. Therefore, researchers should consider the details of transmission of food-borne pathogens before making predictions about the effects of durability on virulence levels (Ewald, 1991a (Ewald, , b, 1994 (Ewald, , 1995 (Ewald, a, 1998 Ewald & de Leo, 2001) .",

Previous mathematical modelling studies investigating the sit-and-wait hypothesis did not incorporate the role of host mobility on transmission rate. A new model using a hump-shaped relationship between virulence and the coefficient of transmission shows that pathogens less dependent on host mobility for transmission should evolve towards higher levels of virulence, in accordance with the empirical results of this study and previous comparative studies.",
