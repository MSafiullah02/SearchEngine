The active compound, produced by Penicillium notatum, was named penicillin. By using the same strategy, other antibiotics such as streptomycin and chloramphenicol were later isolated from different bacterial and fungal fermentations. Antibiotics can be produced by fermentation, an old technique that was utilized for beer and wine production almost 8000 years ago, during the ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia era. Similarly, cheese production by Penicillium roqueforti can be traced back for almost 4000 years. Additional examples of traditional fermentations are soy sauce in Asia and bread production (H\u00f6lker et al. 2004; Seviour et al. 2013). Bread production was common in Egypt in 4000 BC. Beer production using the non-filamentous fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae began in 7000 BC by the Sumerians and Chinese. Wine was made in Iran in 5000 BC and in Egypt in 3000 BC.",

As more genomes are sequenced, it is found that filamentous fungi grasp the genetic capacity to produce an arsenal of secondary metabolites. In fungi, biosynthetic genes are present in clusters coding for large, multidomain, and multimodular enzymes such as polyketide synthases, prenyltransferases, non-ribosomal peptide synthases, and terpene cyclases. Genes adjacent to the biosynthetic gene clusters encode regulatory proteins, oxidases, hydroxylases, and transporters. Aspergilli usually contain 30\u201340 secondary metabolite gene clusters. Most of these clusters coding for secondary metabolites are still cryptic or silent under standard culture conditions (Hertweck 2009). Therefore, mining for these cryptic secondary metabolites can be an excellent source of new drugs by awakening cryptic clusters for secondary metabolism. In addition, recent knowledge on cluster regulation has unlocked many hidden fungal bioactive compounds. Regulation of fungal secondary metabolism has been reviewed by Brakhage (2013). Emphasized are the regulatory elements that control gene transcription, including the targeted activation of silent gene clusters (Brakhage and Schroekh 2011). A method to predict secondary metabolite gene clusters in filamentous fungi has been devised (Anderson et al. 2013).",

A new and approved cephalosporin is ceftobiprole, which is active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and is not hydrolyzed by a number of beta-lactamases from gram-positive bacteria (Shang et al. 2010). Another antibiotic of note is cerulenin, an antifungal agent produced by Acremonium caerelens. It was the first inhibitor of fatty acid biosynthesis discovered (Vance et al. 1972). It alkylates and inactivates the active-site nucleophilic cysteine of the ketosynthase enzyme of fatty acid synthetase by epoxide ring opening.

Despite testing thousands of synthetic chemicals, only a handful of promising structures was obtained. As new synthetic lead compounds became extremely difficult to find, microbial products came into play. Since microorganisms are such a prolific source of structurally diverse bioactive metabolites, over the years, the pharmaceutical industry extended their antibiotic screening programs to look for additional applications of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture (Cardenas et al. 1998; Kremer et al. 2000). As a result of this move, some of the most important products of the pharmaceutical industry were obtained. For example, the immune suppressants have revolutionized medicine by facilitating organ transplantation (Verdine 1996). Other products include anti-tumor drugs, hypocholesterolemic agents, enzyme inhibitors, gastrointestinal motor stimulators, ruminant growth stimulants, insecticides, herbicides, antiparasitics versus coccidia and helminths, and other pharmacological activities. Stimulated by the use of simple enzyme assays for screening, prior to testing in intact animals or in the field, further applications are emerging in various areas of pharmacology and agriculture. In 2013, there were more than 15 secondary metabolites derived from marine fungi in clinical trials (Bhatnagar and Kim 2013). Many of the new natural products from marine sources are polyketides.",

The production of biopharmaceuticals by S. cerevisiae has been reviewed by Nielsen (Nielsen 2013). The yeast is used to make insulin and insulin analogs. The insulin market was $12 billion in 2011. Other products are human serum albumin, hepatitis vaccines, and virus-like particles used for vaccination against human papilloma virus. The advantages of S. cerevisiae include proper folding of human proteins and their secretion into the extracellular medium, facilitating purification and proper post-translational modification of the protein. This includes proteolytic processing of signal peptides, disulfide bond formation, subunit assembly, acylation, and glycosylation. Human serum albumin is produced at 3 g L\u22121.",

It is a steroidal alkaloid diterpenoid that has a characteristic N -benzoylphenyl isoserine side chain and a tetracycline ring (Fig. 2). It inhibits rapidly dividing mammalian cancer cells by promoting tubulin polymerization and interfering with normal microtubule breakdown during cell division. The benzoyl group of the molecule is particularly crucial for maintaining the strong bioactivity of taxol. The drug also inhibits several fungi (species of Pythium, Phytophthora, and Aphanomyces) by the same mechanism. In 1992, taxol was approved for refractory ovarian cancer and today is used against breast cancer and advanced forms of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (Newman and Cragg 2007). A formulation in which paclitaxel is bound to albumin is sold under the trademark Abraxane\u00ae. Taxol sales amounted to $1.6 billion in 2006 for Bristol-Myers Squibb, representing 10% of the company\u2019s pharmaceutical sales and its third largest selling product. It has reached $3.7 billion annual sales in international markets.\n",

Fungi such as Colletotrichum gloeosporoides, Colletotrichum capsici, Fusarium maire, Nodulisporium sylviforme, Pestalotiopsis microspora, Pestalotiopsis versicolor, Phyllosticta citricarpa, Taxomyces andreanae, and Tubercularia sp. are taxol producers (Stierle et al. 1993; Flores-Bustamante et al. 2010; Gangadevi and Muthumary 2008; Kumaran et al. 2010, 2011; Li et al. 1996; Wang et al. 2000; Xu et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2004]. C. gloeosporoides produced 163 \u00b5g L\u22121 of taxol (Gangadevi and Muthumary 2008), and the endophyte F. maire made 225 \u03bcg L\u22121 (Xu et al. 2006). The production by P. citricarpa amounted to 265 \u03bcg L\u22121 (Kumaran et al. 2008) and was reported at 417 \u03bcg L\u22121 by submerged fermentation with an engineered strain of the endophytic fungus Ozonium sp. (EFY-21). The transformed strain overproduced the rate-limiting enzyme of taxol biosynthesis and taxadiene synthase (Wei et al. 2012). The endophyte P. versicolor, from the plant Taxus caspodata, produced 478 \u00b5g L\u22121 (Kumaran et al. 2010). C. capsici from Capsicum annuum made 687 \u03bcg L\u22121 (Kumaran et al. 2011). Another endophytic fungus, Phoma betae, isolated from the medicinal tree Ginkgo biloba produced taxol at 795 \u03bcg L\u22121 (Kumaran et al. 2012). Colletotrichum annutum from Capsium annuum Cladosporium cladosporoides, an endophyte of the Taxus media tree, produced 800 \u03bcg L\u22121 of taxol (Zhang et al. 2009). Metarhizium anisopiliae H-27, isolated from the tree Taxus chinensis, yielded 846 \u03bcg L\u22121 (Liu et al. 2009). Although a review of taxol production by endophytic fungi indicated that strain improvement had resulted in levels of only 0.4\u20131.0 mg L\u22121 (Zhou et al. 2010), it was reported that another fungus, Alternaria alternate var. monosporus, from the bark of Taxus yunanensis, after ultraviolet and nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis, could produce taxol at 227 mg L\u22121 (Duan et al. 2008).",

The fungus was isolated from the plant Nathapodytes foetida (Wall and Wani 1996). Recently, it was found that Trichoderma atroviridi strain LY357, an endophytic fungus from C. acuminata, was an improved producer of camptothecin. The endophytic fungus produced 142 \u00b5g L\u22121 of camptothecin in the presence of the elicitor methyljasmonate and XAD adsorbent resin (Pu et al. 2013). In view of the low concentration of camptothecin in tree roots and poor yield from chemical synthesis, the fungal fermentation is very promising for industrial production of camptothecin. It is used for recurrent colon cancer and has unusual activity against lung, ovarian, and uterine cancer (Amna et al. 2006). Colon cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer fatalities in the USA and the third most common cancer among the US citizens.\n",

Cyclosporin A was originally discovered in the 1970s as a narrow-spectrum antifungal peptide produced by the mold, Tolypocladium nivenum (previously Tolypocladium inflatum) in an aerobic fermentation (Borel et al. 1976). Cyclosporins (Fig. 4) are a family of neutral, highly lipophilic, cyclic undecapeptides containing some unusual amino acids, synthesized by a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase, cyclosporin synthetase. Discovery of the immunosuppressive activity of this secondary metabolite led to use in heart, liver, and kidney transplants and to the overwhelming success of the organ transplant field (Borel 2002). Cyclosporin was approved for use in 1983. It is thought to bind to the cytosolic protein cyclophilin (immunophilin) of immunocompetent lymphocytes, especially T lymphocytes. This complex of cyclosporin and cyclophilin inhibits calcineurin, which under normal circumstances is responsible for activating the transcription of interleukin-2. It also inhibits lymphokine production and interleukin release and therefore leads to a reduced function of effector T cells. Annual world sales of cyclosporin A are approximately $2 billion. Cyclosporin A also has activity against corona viruses (de Wilde et al. 2011).\n",

Bartolomeo Gosio (1863\u20131944), an Italian physician, discovered the compound in 1893 (Bentley 2001). Gosio isolated a fungus from spoiled corn, which he named Penicillium glaucum, which was later reclassified as P. brevicompactum. He isolated the crystals of the compound from culture filtrates in 1896 and found it to inhibit the growth of Bacillus anthracis. This was the first time an antibiotic had been crystallized and the first time that a pure compound had ever been shown to have antibiotic activity. The work was forgotten, but fortunately the compound was rediscovered by Alsberg and Black (1913) and given the name mycophenolic acid. They used a strain originally isolated from spoiled corn in Italy called Penicillium stoloniferum, a synonym of P. brevi-compactum. The chemical structure was elucidated many years later (1952) by Birkinshaw et al. (1952) in England. Mycophenolic acid has antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antitumor, antipsoriasis, and immunosuppressive activities. Its antiviral activity is exerted against yellow fever, dengue virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus (Sebastian et al. 2011). It was never commercialized as an antibiotic because of its toxicity, but its 2-morpholinoethylester was approved as a new immunosuppressant for kidney transplantation in 1995 and for heart transplants in 1998 (Lee et al. 1990). The ester is called mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept) and is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed to mycophenolic acid in the body. It is sometimes used along with cyclosporin in kidney, liver, and heart transplants. Mycophenolic acid also appears to have anti-angiogenic activity (Chong et al. 2006).",

Many people cannot control their level of cholesterol at a healthy level by diet alone and require hypocholesterolemic agents. High blood cholesterol leads to atherosclerosis, which is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by continuous accumulation of atheromatous plaque within the arterial wall, causing stenosis and ischemia. Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of human death. The last two decades have witnessed the introduction of a variety of anti-atherosclerotic therapies. The statins form a class of hypo-lipidemic drugs, formed as secondary metabolites by fungi, and used to lower cholesterol by inhibiting the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis, i.e., 3-hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. Inhibition of this enzyme in the liver stimulates low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, resulting in an increased clearance of LDL from the bloodstream and a decrease in blood cholesterol levels. They can reduce total plasma cholesterol by 20\u201340%. Through their cholesterol-lowering effect, they reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, prevent stroke, and reduce development of peripheral vascular disease (Nicholls et al. 2007).",

Although compactin was not of commercial importance, its derivatives achieved strong medical and commercial success. Lovastatin (monacolin K; mevinolin; Mevacor TM) was isolated in broths of Monascus rubra and Aspergillus terreus (Alberts et al. 1980; Endo and Monacolin 1979). Lovastatin, developed by Merck & Co. and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987, was the first commercially marketed statin.

Gibberellic acid, a member of the mycotoxin group known as gibberellins, is a product of Gibberella fujikuroi and causes \u201cfoolish rice seedling\u201d disease in rice (Jefferys 1970). Gibberellins are employed to speed up the malting of barley, improve the quality of malt, increase the yield of vegetables, and cut the time in half for obtaining lettuce and sugar beet seed crops. They are isoprenoid growth regulators, controlling flowering, seed germination, and stem elongation (Tudzinski 1999). More than 25 tons are produced annually with a market of over $100 billion.\n",

Beta-carotene and lycopene are highly unsaturated isoprene derivatives which stimulate the immune system and prevent degenerative diseases and cancer. Some are made microbiologically. They had a 2010 market of $1.2 billion, and their market is growing by 2.3% per year. Adaptive laboratory evolution was used to increase the microbial production of carotenoids in a genetically engineered S. cerevisiae strain. It was carried out by using a periodic hydrogen peroxide shocking strategy. The improved production was due to up-regulation of genes related to biosynthesis of lipid and mevalonate (Reyes et al. 2013). The production amounted to 16 mg g\u22121 dry cell weight. Beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, has a market of $242 million. Although most is made chemically, it can be made by Blakeslea trispora at 3 g L\u22121 (Vachali et al. 2012).

This oxygenated carotenoid pigment (Fig. 7) is used in the feed, food, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmetic industries. It is responsible for the orange to pink color of salmonid flesh and the reddish color of boiled crustacean shells. Feeding of penreared salmonids with a diet containing this yeast induces pigmentation of the white muscle (Johnson et al. 1980). It is a very good antioxidant, 10 times more active than beta-carotene and 100 times more than alpha-tocopherol. It is the second most important carotenoid. Astaxanthin enhances the immune system and protects skin from radiation injury and cancer. It can be produced synthetically as hydroxyl-astaxanthin from petrochemicals with a selling price of $2500 per kg. However, the natural product is favored because the synthetic product is a mixture of stereoisomers. X. dendror-hous produces astaxanthin at 390 mg L\u22121.\n",

H. polymorpha has been used for the production of hepatitis B vaccine, interferon alpha-2a, hirudin, insulin, phytase, lipase, hexose oxidase, interleukin-6, serum albumin, glucose oxidase, glycolate oxidase, and catalase; the first four are on the market. This yeast reaches high growth density, secretes proteins as large as 150 kDa, and is highly productive. For example, it produces 13.5 g L\u22121 of recombinant phytase. Other useful yeasts include K. lactis for the production of bovine chymosin (rennin), glucoamylase, human serum albumin, interleukin-1 and interleukin-1 beta, and many other recombinant proteins. S. pombe has been used to produce human lipocortin I, human papillomavirus type 16 vaccine, and many others. The beauty of these yeasts is their ability to perform post-translational modifications similar to those of higher eukaryotes, e.g., correct folding, disulfide bond formation, N- and O-linked glycosylation, and proteolytic processing of signal sequences. About 70% of all therapeutic proteins are glycoproteins. The production of recombinant microbial enzymes by fungi has been reviewed by Liu et al. (2013a, b).\n",

Ethanol can be used as a fuel by itself or in combination with gasoline (E10, E15, and E85). It is mainly made in the USA (over 7 billion gallons from corn) and in Brazil. However, corn can only yield 15 billion gallons, and corn prices are rising. Cellulose is a possible source of ethanol but instead of containing only glucose, cellulose also contains C5 sugars such as xylose and arabinose. The best C5 utilizer is P. stipitis which can produce ethanol and clean up concentrated toxins liberated from lignocellulose degradation. Its production of ethanol has been reviewed by Agbogo and Coward-Kelly (2008). It can produce ethanol from pretreated sources of biomass such as red oaks, wheat straw, sugarcane bagasse, rice straw, corn cobs, corn stover, aspen wood, pinewood, and poplar wood. From aspen wood such as Orpinomyces defined medium, 61 g L\u22121 can be made (Slininger et al. 2006). Attributes of P. stipitis include consumption of acetic acid, reduction in the furan ring toxins in HMF, and furfural present in cellulosic biomass conversions.",

Biodelignification of lignocellulose has been carried out by ascomycetes including Trichoderma reesei, basidiomycetes such as the white rot fungus Phaenerochaete sp. (Chandel et al. 2015). The key enzyme in delignification is manganese peroxidase. Biodelignification is the most expensive step in the conversion of biomass to ethanol mainly due to its slow rate of action.

Filamentous fungi can produce native cellulases at levels of more than 100 g L\u22121 (Cherry and Fidanstsel 2003). Novozymes, Genencor, and Iogen produce cellulase from Trichoderma, whereas dyadic uses Chrysosporium lucknowense. These commercial fungal fermentations produce over 100 g crude cellulase per liter of broth, much higher than that produced by bacteria. An important move is to decrease the amount of cellulase used to produce ethanol. The overall action of T. reesei cellulase on cellulosic biomass is limited by a low content of beta-glucosidase. The result is an accumulation of cellobiose which limits further breakdown. By expressing the beta-glucosidase gene of Pericona sp. in T. reesei, (Dashtban and Qin 2012) were able to increase the level of beta-glucosidase, the overall cellulase activity, and the action on biomass residues.",

It is a very good fuel, contains less sulfur than conventional fuel, can be used in diesel engines without modification, and can be blended in any ratio with petroleum diesel. It is biodegradable and non-toxic (Lin et al. 2013). The four different methods of biodiesel production include transesterification, blending, microemulsions, and pyrolysis. Transesterification is the method of choice, the catalyst being chemical (acid or base) or an enzyme. Favored is transesterification via enzymes, i.e., lipases. Microbial lipases are excellent since they are stable in organic solvents, do not need cofactors, have broad substrate specificity and high enantiospecificity. Candida antartica is a favored lipase producer. Yields of enzymic transesterification can reach 100%. Maximum enzyme-catalyzed transesterification occurs at 55 \u00b0C. The cost of lipase is high, but it can be lowered by the use of enzyme immobilization and recycling of the immobilized enzyme. Adsorption is the best immobilization procedure due to its simplicity, ease, use of mild conditions, and low cost. Genetic engineering has been used to convert S. cerevisiae into a biodiesel producer, i.e., one that is oleaginous, supplying fatty acids and alcohols, and converting them to biodiesel.

In 1893, the German microbiologist Carl Wehmer discovered that sugar-growing fungi secreted citric acid. After World War I, the fermentation became the method of choice. John N. Currie had found that A. niger was an excellent producer of citric acid and, as a result, the Pfizer company in New York began large-scale fermentation production in 1923. Worldwide production is 1.6 million tons per year. About 95% is used in the food industry. Other uses include chemicals, medicinal, textiles, and metallurgy. Chemicals include surfactants and synthetic detergents (Morgunov et al. 2013). In addition to A. niger, another producer is Y. lipolytica. Production by the latter is favored by limitation of cell growth via limiting levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulfur with nitrogen limitation being the most useful. This yeast produces high levels of both citric and isocitric acids from rapeseed oil (Kamzolova et al. 2013).",

Many improve cardiovascular health, and certain of them improve eye function and memory in newborn infants and in adults. Microbial oils are produced by 30\u201340 species of yeast and also by molds. The producers are known as oleaginous microbes. Fungi can accumulate 70% of their biomass as oils. DHA is produced at 2000 tonnes per year and has a market of $317 million.

However, due to different situations, pathogenic microbes have become resistant to many antibiotics creating a dangerous situation and therefore the need for new antibiotics is imperative. Unfortunately, most of the large pharmaceutical companies have abandoned the search for new antimicrobial compounds. Due to economics, they have concluded that drugs directed against chronic diseases offer a better revenue stream than do antimicrobial agents, for which the length of treatment is short and government restriction is likely. Some small pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are still developing antibiotics but most depend on venture capital rather than sales income, and with the present regulations, face huge barriers to enter into the market. These barriers were raised with the best intentions of ensuring public safety but they are having the opposite effect, i.e., termination of antibiotic development while resistance continues to increase (Livermore 2004). However, there are some new bright possibilities. One of the more promising is the utilization of uncultivated microorganisms. Considering that 99% of bacteria and 95% of fungi have not yet been cultivated in the laboratory, efforts to find means to grow such uncultured microorganisms are proceeding and succeeding (Kaeberlein et al. 2002). Furthermore, researchers are now extracting bacterial DNA from soil samples, cloning large fragments into, for example, bacterial artificial chromosomes, expressing them in a host bacterium and screening the library for new antibiotics. This metagenomic effort could open up the exciting possibility of a large untapped pool from which new natural products could be discovered (Clardy et al. 2006). Another exciting possibility is that of genome mining (Scheffler et al. 2013). In addition to these relatively new techniques, chemical and biological modification of old antibiotics could still supply new and powerful drugs. These comments also apply to non-antibiotics such as antitumor agents and other microbial products. In addition, natural products must continue to be tested for desirable therapeutic activities. I believe that significant progress in identifying new antibiotics, oncology therapeutics, and other useful medicines will be made, probably not by the big pharmaceutical companies, but by biotechnology companies and small research groups from institutes and universities.",
