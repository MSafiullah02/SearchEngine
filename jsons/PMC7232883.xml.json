As of now on 4th April 2020, Europe and USA\nare new epicentres of COVID-19 Pandemic. Even in the past, different coronaviruses have\ncaused multiple human diseases that resulted in global epidemics such as the Middle East\nrespiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus\ndisease 2019 (COVID-19). While the coronaviruses have a significant impact on human health,\nthe general public has an inferior awareness of coronavirus pathogenesis and infection.\nCOVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020 as the worldwide human population is facing\nhigh risk from contracting the nCoV infection. Many countries, including India, has\nannounced lockdown in the country and to maintain social distancing to avoid further spread\nas no drug or vaccine is available against SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus has been classified into\nfour subfamilies based on their shape and host. These subfamilies are alpha-coronavirus,\nbeta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus and delta coronavirus (Paules et al., 2020). Alpha- coronavirus and beta-coronavirus are\nconsidered to have been originated from bats, while the gamma and delta coronaviruses are\nconsidered to be derived from birds and pigs (Banerjee et al., 2019). Coronaviruses contain a positive sense, single-strand RNA\ngenome coding for viral polymerase, RNA synthesis materials, and large non-structural\npolypeptide. Coronavirus genome contains transcriptional modification, including\n5\u2019methylated cap and a 3\u2019polyadenylated tail. Coronaviruses have very high rates of error in\nRNA replication due to constant errors by RNA dependent RNA polymerase (Banerjee et al.,\n2019; Lau et al., 2018).",

In the entire\nworld, India is recognized where spices have been traditionally used as a source of\nmedicine. Many active pharmaceutical gradients have been identified and extracted having a\nwide range of physiological and pharmacological properties (Sachan et al., 2018). Apart from the regular uses of spices in\nculinary activities, they are widely used as indigenous medicines, nutraceuticals, in\naromatherapy, as natural colouring agents, perfumes, cosmetics etc. In recent years there\nhas been experimental evidence on physiological benefits that could be drawn in the context\nof various diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular issues and inflammatory disorders like\narthritis and cancer. They have also been identified as preventive agents in certain\nconditions. Spices like red pepper, garlic, and fenugreek have been reported to have\nhypercholesterolemic activity, whereas fenugreek and garlic are also known to reduce and\ncontrol blood sugar levels (Bhagya & Raveendra, 2017). The main active ingredient of turmeric, Curcumin has been widely studied to\nhave a broad spectrum of medicinal value ranging from anti-cancerous, anti-inflammatory and\nan anti-amyloidogenic activity (Bhagya & Raveendra, 2017). Several computational studies related to drug or vaccine development\nagainst SARS-CoV-2 is recently published (Aanouz et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020; Joshi et al.,\n2020; Muralidharan et al., 2020; Sarma et al., 2020).",

            "text": "The results of MD simulation for both apo and ligand complex is analyzed for the\n50 ns of time scale to understand the dynamic behavior and stability. MD\nsimulation is performed for the total of 50 ns and the trajectories are for\nRMSD plot as shown in the Figure 3. The figure\nrepresents the colors with (a) Apo protein, complexed with (b) Alpha ketoamide, (c)\nArjun glycoside, (d) Carnosol, and (e) Rosmanol for the 50 ns of time\nscale. For the apo protein, observed the initial 45 ns of MD simulation as\nstable, but after the 45th ns there is a sudden drift and that may occur due\nto the higher occupancy of flexible loops in the C-terminal region (182-304 residues).\nEven though the apo protein shows the value of \u223c2.0 \u00c5 till 47th\nns and remaining 3 ns ends with \u223c3.4 \u00c5. For understanding the\nresidue wise fluctuation between the apo and ligand complex, the RMSF values are\nplotted. The RMSD deviation for the apo and complex proteins clearly shows the dynamic\nmovement that occurs in the loop regions. For understanding the residues participated in\nthe causative for fluctuations, the RMSF plot is provided in the Figure 4. Here, the amino acid in each position is calculated for\nits deviation value with the calculated timescale of 50 ns. For apo\nprotein, the amino acid from 70-75th, 160-175th position shows the\ndeviation up to \u223c4\u00c5, apart from these regions other amino acids are deviating from\n\u223c1-3\u00c5. The deviation that occurs in the 70-75th, 160-175th\nposition may be functionally reason for the drift in apo protein RMSD at 45th\nns. While comparing the apo RMSF values with the complex protein RMSF, notably Carnosol\nis showing high deviations than the other ligand complexes. The amino acid positions\nfrom 40-60th, 150-155th, 178-200th position is showing\nhigher deviations, that ranges from \u223c4-6\u00c5 deviations. Due to these positional amino acid\nfluctuations, the RMSD of Carnosol deviates approximately 4 \u00c5 after the\n26th ns. Similarly, another compound Rosmanol also showing the fluctuations\nin C-terminal regions, that results in the \u223c3-3.5 \u00c5 deviations in the RMSD\nvalues. The protein secondary structure is framed as 3 sheets, 7 beta hairpins, 9 beta\nbulges, 13 strands, 32 beta turns, 3 gamma turns from this 182-304 residues are occupied\ndominantly by loop regions. These 122 residues in the C-terminal functionally act in the\nMD simulation, and thus the sudden drift happens in the 45th ns. This values\nof RMSD for the apo protein, is compared with ligand molecules in the Figure 3, and for understanding the deviations, the\n25th to 50th ns is focused. The results of ligand complex for\nthe MD simulation of 50 ns of timescale shows that the ligand complex Alpha\nketoamide (Red color) and Arjun glycoside (Blue color) shows stable throughout the\nsimulation. While comparing these two Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside ligand complex\nwith apo protein, the ligand complex is matched with apo protein for the timescale of\n45th ns. After the 45th ns the apo protein is drifted upwards,\nbut the Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside ligand complex remains stable. This may be\ndue to the strong interaction pattern seen in Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside\ninteractions with the protein. Both the Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside ligand bound\ncomplex are stable and positioned in the range of \u223c2\u00c5, which is close to the apo protein\ntill 47th ns. The Figures 5a and 5b\nshows the hydrogen bond interactions for the Alpha ketoamide and Arjun glycoside, which\nclearly shows the minimum participation of 2-3 hydrogen bonds seen in between the Alpha\nketoamide and protein, and minimum participation of 4-6 hydrogen bonds between the Arjun\nglycoside and protein. This active participation of hydrogen bonds between the Alpha\nketoamide and Arjun glycoside with protein makes the ligand complex stable for\n50 ns of MD simulations. The ligand Carnosol shows stable movement in\nterms of RMSD values by showing a narrow graph, but while comparing with apo protein,\nthe Carnosol ligand complex is deviated from the 14th ns and stays in the\nrange bound of \u223c3.4 \u00c5 till the end of the simulations. For attaining the\nstable MD simulation for the Carnosol ligand bound complex, 2-3 hydrogen bonds are\nactively contributed and makes the complex stable in the dynamic state. The ligand\nRosmanol bound complex shows stability till the 26th ns with the range of\n\u223c2.5 \u00c5, but after that, the drift happens to make the RMSD value deviated\nin upward direction and fix the positional RMSD with the range of \u223c4 \u00c5.\nThis may be due to the loss of hydrogen bonding interactions after the 27th\nns seen in the Figure 5d. Figure 5d says that the initial 27 ns shows the\nhydrogen bond interactions in the range of 2-3 between the protein and ligand, but after\n27th ns the ligand losses the hydrogen bonding ability and shows the\nhydrogen bond interactions in the range of 1-2 between the protein and ligand. Overall,\nthe apo protein shows a narrow range of stability and notable fluctuations are also\nshown, that indicates the participation of loop structures. Those fluctuations are\narrested through the active interactions of ligand molecules that shows strong binding\nbetween the protein and ligand.",
