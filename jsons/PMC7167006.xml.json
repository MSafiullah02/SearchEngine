One fourth of the women received a narcotic\u2010containing medication, and 13% received a psychotropic drug (1). Another study showed that mothers received an average of 3.1 non\u2010vitamin medications during pregnancy (2). A recent study of French women showed that 99% received a prescription for at least one medication during pregnancy, with a mean of 13.6 medications per woman (3): 1.6% of the women received a medication in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) X category (fetal risk outweighs benefits), and 59% of women had a prescription for drugs from the D category (fetal risk but benefits may be acceptable). When expressed as a percentage of exposed women, the most commonly prescribed classes of drugs were gastrointestinal drugs (69.4%), dermatologic drugs (63.0%), and analgesics (62.3%) (3). An accompanying commentary does point out that, for cultural reasons, the French have one of the highest prescribing levels in Europe.",

During pregnancy, women continue to be affected by the usual illnesses that the non\u2010pregnant population faces. In addition, there are multiple conditions, some of which directly result from the pregnancy or are worsened by it, that may require pharmacologic therapy. Thus, the health care provider must be aware of appropriate pharmacologic therapy for a variety of conditions and the potential impact on the pregnant or lactating women. In general, the clinician should ask what the appropriate treatment in the non\u2010pregnant state would be. In most cases, the answer is the same for women who are pregnant (6). When several choices are available, as is often the case, the second principle is to choose pharmacologic agents by their relative safety for the patient and the fetus.",

Thus, the first trimester is the most critical time period for a teratogenic effect. After this, any effect will likely involve growth restriction or an effect on the nervous system and gonadal tissue. Overall growth continues throughout the remainder of the pregnancy and because the nervous system and gonads develop slower than other organ systems, they are vulnerable to teratogenic effects over a longer period of time.",

Several characteristics of the FDA classification system may lead to overly frightening perceptions by the public of drug dangers. For example, it has been known for some time that only about 20\u201030 commonly used drugs are proven teratogens, yet 7% of the more than 1,000 medications listed in the Physicians' Desk Reference are classified as category X (15, 16). The definitions of the FDA pregnancy safety categories are listed in Table 1. All new medications are classified as category C because most products initially FDA approved to be both safe and efficacious have only animal data available on teratogenicity and teratogenicity in animals is common. This leads to an elevated impression of danger in drugs that have not been used for extensive periods of time. In addition, there are no FDA regulations requiring further study, seeking more data or performing human evaluations so that changes in classification are rare.",

Briefly, the FDA began to ask a series of questions concerning the pregnancy labeling system that had been started in 1979. At a public hearing in September 1997, they asked whether health care providers relied on the system, is it useful, what is good or bad about it, and what are the problems and how can they be fixed? It has been thought that the system in place is used and appreciated for its simplicity. On the other hand, the simplicity is a problem when trying to apply it in clinical decision making, given the fact that the data behind the specific category assignments is not clearly evident.",

In addition, indomethacin can cause profound adverse effects on fetal renal function, leading to decreased urine output and frank oligohydramnios (47, 48). If indomethacin is given for a prolonged period, oligohydramnios can lead to pulmonary hypoplasia and neonatal death. In general, we do not recommend use for more than 2 days beyond the first trimester. Similar but more limited information is available for ibuprofen (Advil).

Pruritus without accompanying rash on the arms, legs, and trunk typically begins after 20 weeks and progresses until delivery.

Divided doses of 8\u201020 g/day were used. However, the results were often disappointing, doing little to relieve maternal symptoms while being difficult for the patient to take. Women who take cholestyramine should also take vitamin K throughout the remainder of pregnancy because cholestyramine binds this vitamin and can lead to vitamin K deficiency. There is now some evidence that ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), also called ursodiol (Actigall), a minor, naturally occurring hydrophilic bile salt, both reduces maternal pruritus and improves biochemical abnormalities without obvious adverse effects on the newborn (66, 67, 68).
