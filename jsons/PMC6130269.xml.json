Due to an inappropriate early selection of potential drug candidates (both molecular and biological), many clinical trials have led to disappointing results and thereby unnecessary costs, despite promising preclinical data.1 More reliable in vitro tumor models are required to discover more successful drug candidates, and importantly to reject ineffective drugs long before the onset of first human trials. Currently, traditional in vitro testing with two-dimensional cell cultures has limited predictability; therefore, animal trials remain the gold standard. When looking critically at all available preclinical tumor models, there still is a poor correlation with drug effectiveness found finally in clinical human trials, even when animal models are employed extensively.2 Moreover, animal models, in particular rodent models, are sometimes completely incompatible with oncolytic virotherapy research.",

As a matter of fact, oncolytic viruses (OVs), with their complex mechanisms of action, need realistic preclinical models that assure representation of such important features as tumor microenvironment profiles. One possible solution to this challenge is based on the employment of three-dimensional cell cultures, which constitute a more valid in vitro tumor model than traditional two-dimensional monolayer cell cultures. Here, we review the most common three-dimensional tumor cell-culture techniques currently used in virotherapy research. Published work in the field of oncolytic virotherapy employing tumor cell spheroids, hydrogel cultures, cultures derived from tissue specimens, organotypic raft cultures, and organoids is included and discussed in this review. In addition, we present application examples for three-dimensional cell cultures in oncolytic virotherapy. The tumor-organoid-culture model can be employed for individual patient virograms. Further, we focus on the development of novel OVs in three-dimensional cultures and the utility of three-dimensional tumor cell cultures to study viral agents targeting the extracellular matrix (ECM).",

It has been shown that the kind and amount of tumor cell interactions like gap junctions exert a significant impact on suicide-gene-armed virotherapy and the so-called bystander effect.5 This refers to the spread of the activated suicide drug by diffusion into neighboring uninfected tumor cells and their subsequent nononcolytic but \u201cgenotoxic\u201d cell death. This bystander effect can differ between two-dimensional and three-dimensional tumor cell cultures, due to different forms of tumor cell interactions, multiple tumor cell layers, and drug distribution features.6 Three-dimensional tumor cell cultures are used to study this effect more realistically.7 To sum up, three-dimensional cell cultures are especially important in the study of suicide-gene-armed virotherapeutics because of the realistic representation of the bystander effect.",

In comparison to primary tumor cells, conventionally used tumor cell lines with high passage numbers harbor several mutations and phenotypic changes. In two-dimensional monolayer tumor cell cultures, highly proliferating tumor cells exhibiting robust adhesion to plastic cell-culture bottles and plates are selected. It has been found that both histological and genetic architecture are more conserved in three-dimensional tumor cell cultures. For example, expression of receptors and molecules that are involved in viral entry might be altered in monolayer tumor cell cultures. To avoid the disadvantages of common tumor cell lines, some groups primarily choose purified primary tumor cells derived from vital tumor tissue of human or xenograft origin or tumor cells with very low passage numbers to form tumor cell spheroids. In this context, Bauerschmitz et al11 and Lam et al12 demonstrated adenoviral replication in spheroids derived from unpassaged purified ovarian cancer cells. Later, they showed higher primary infection rates, higher rates of subsequent replication, and viral transgene expression in monolayer tumor cell cultures, suggesting this was due to an enlarged relative surface per cell and subsequent faster initial/primary infection.13",

            "text": "Increased resistance to oncolysis in tumor cell spheroids displays a frequently discussed aspect. To enhance viral distribution and tumor cell killing, irradiation has been successfully combined with an oncolytic adenovirus in glioblastoma spheroids.14 Correa et al found lower myxoma-virus-mediated cell killing in spheroids than in adherent cells, because of downregulated Akt kinase in nonadherent cells.15 When tumor cell spheroids are reattached to the surface, Akt is upregulated again and myxoma virus effectively kills spheroid tumor cells. Later, the same group showed a similar mechanism of tumor cell resistance in spheroids for Maraba virus and its entry molecule: the LDL (low-density lipoprotein) receptor. Reattachment of the tumor cell spheroids relieved this resistance, which can serve as a model for metastasis in this context (Table 1).16 Therefore, altered activation of cellular pathways in three-dimensional tumor cell cultures can influence viral tumor cell entry and tumor cell killing. Different entry mechanisms between two- and three-dimensional tumor cell cultures have also been studied in glioblastoma cells for reovirus.17",

For instance, Yang et al showed that lung cancer cells grown in spheroid cultures exhibited cancer stem-cell characteristics such that they were quiescent, drug-resistant, and only slowly proliferating.18 Similar properties were shown also for bladder cancer, liver cancer, and brain cancer cells in spheroids (Table 1).8,19,20 All these models were used to investigate adenoviral targeting on cancer stem-like cells. Resistant cancer stem-like cells constitute a major hurdle in cancer therapy, especially when combating glioblastomas. As such, reovirus, measles vaccine virus, and parvovirus have been successfully targeted to glioblastoma stem-like cells in spheroid models.21\u201323 In future, standard chemotherapy regimens could be augmented with cancer stem-like cell-killing OVs to eradicate all tumor cell populations in an additive immunovirotherapeutic approach.",

Of note, this is a nondestructive but elaborate approach, quite useful to avoid disintegration of the spheroids for single measurements. When applied to very simple measurements, such as a mere determination of volume alterations of spheroids, such approaches cannot be considered suitable in providing valid parameters for quantification of oncolysis (in the course of virus replication, tumor cell volumes can be altered, despite the fact that oncolysis has not yet started).",

Because of the large scale of viral agents compared to molecular drugs, Matrigel has a great influence on viral distribution and spread. Viral binding to different ECM proteins also contributes to inhibition of viral spread.49 Valyi-Nagy et al studied Matrigel cell cultures extensively using uveal melanoma cell lines.50 Later, the same group extended the experiments with breast, prostate, and embryonic cancer cells.51 In this work, they found differences in growth patterns among the varying cells in three-dimensional cell cultures and obvious differences in common two-dimensional cell cultures. With herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), their results indicated massive inhibition of viral penetration through Matri-gel. Furthermore, they infected cells in a monolayer tumor cell culture and embedded them in the Matrigel matrix after infection. Comparing this model with a two-dimensional cell culture, they demonstrated ECM-mediated inhibition of viral replication after viral entry. This \u201cquiescent\u201d infection was relieved by the outgrowth of single cells from cell aggregates in a three-dimensional culture. Then, single \u201coutgrown\u201d tumor cells started again to express virus-encoded GFP as a marker for viral replication. In summary, at least two mechanisms of resistance in Matrigel cell cultures were found: on one hand, the physical Matrigel barrier working quite efficiently against viral distribution and spread, and on the other, the ECM-mediated suppression of viral replication (Table 3).50,51",

Infection of prostate cancer cells with an oncolytic adenovirus reduced the vasculogenic network in this model. To sum up, the authors recommended a combinatorial therapy with adenovirus targeting cancer cells and a second adenovirus targeting the VEGF pathway in prostate cancer. Combination of different three-dimensional culture techniques has led to more useful and realistic tumor models for preclinical evaluation of OVs. Avci et al grew spheroids from cocultured glioma cells and endothelial cells in microwells of a synthetic PEG diacrylate hydrogel to evaluate the efficacy of an oncolytic adenovirus.9 Interestingly, the reduction in cell viability in this model was larger than in a monolayer coculture of the same cells. Perhaps susceptibility to the adenovirus was increased in the three-dimensional model because there was no hydrogel matrix between the cells, as they were grown in PEG diacrylate hydrogel microwells.",

In this context, the organotypic slice model has been used several times to assess the safety profile and specificity of viral agents (Table 4).56\u201363 Rots et al investigated the tumor-on/liver-off profile of replicating adenoviruses with tissue slices prepared from tumor tissue and others from liver tissue.57 Viral replication was demonstrated via transgene expression of GFP or luciferase. Moreover, they quantified viral DNA in the supernatant. In conclusion, the authors showed replication of the wild-type adenovirus in liver slices, whereas replication of the tumor-targeted virus was almost fully restricted to tumor slices and attenuated in liver slices. Mixed slices containing tumor and healthy liver tissue were employed by Zimmermann et al.56 They studied oncolytic activity of different measles vaccine virus strains in organotypic slices and showed a tumor favoring an infection profile, being demonstrated by higher levels of GFP-marker gene expression, as well as viral protein detection in tumor areas.

Unlike other Flaviviridae, Zika virus replicates selectively in cancer stem-like cells and does not infect differentiated glioblastoma cells. Therefore, the authors measured organoid areas and made immunofluorescent stains of proliferation, stem cell, and apoptosis markers. They also used organotypic slices to assess the safety of Zika virus as an oncolytic agent. In summary, the authors concluded that Zika virus held effective oncolytic potential against glioblastoma, but further studies and genetic engineering have to be done to achieve safe and efficient antitumoral treatment in the future.",

In accordance with this, Kuhn et al established a \u201cdirected evolution\u201d method in a three-dimensional Matrigel culture of ovarian cancer cells.53 In a first step, several serotypes of adenoviruses were mixed and mutagenesis induced chemically. Afterward, this viral pool was used to infect ovarian cancer cells with high multiplicities of infection to allow recombination among the different viral serotypes. Then, tumor cell cultures were infected with low multiplicities of infection and the viral pool obtained from this supernatant used for a next/subsequent infection cycle. Several passages of the viral pool led to the selection of the most potent and effective viral isolates. Kuhn et al employed two- and three-dimensional cultures of ovarian cancer cells for this approach and compared the resultant viral isolates. In vitro, the viral isolate from the two-dimensional cell culture was as efficient as the virus derived from the three-dimensional culture. However, in a mouse model of intraperitoneal carcinomatosis of ovarian cancer, the virus developed in three-dimensional cell culture was found to be more effective than an OV derived from two-dimensional cell culture. Moreover, this virus showed greater tumor selectivity, due to its attenuation in normal human cells. The authors concluded that Matrigel cultures might be superior for bioselection of OVs, as they are much closer to in vivo tumor biology than any other cultures.",

Their more realistic depiction of the in vivo tumor environment helps us to understand and improve therapy options for cancer patients, such as oncolytic virotherapy. This is particularly important for OVs, because their oncolytic efficiency depends on cell metabolism, activity of signaling pathways, expression of entry receptors, and their spreading capabilities being strongly influenced by the ECM, tumor stroma, and the immune system. To investigate this complex mechanism of action, more complex in vitro tumor models are required. In this regard, each model has favorable aspects. Tumor cell spheroids are able to mimic tumor cells in different metabolic states and provide realistic chemical gradients. To study the interaction of OVs with the ECM, hydrogel culture systems seem to be the best solution. Organotypic tissue cultures derived from primary tumor tissue maintain the histological cell architecture of the tumor, and can be employed as safety assays for OVs as well. For epithelial cancers, organotypic raft cultures can constitute a suitable in vitro model. Tumor-organoid cultures are easiest to handle, and can mimic stem-cell properties and virus\u2013ECM interactions. Of course, further investigations have to be done to establish three-dimensional cell cultures as a common alternative to more traditional assays. However, such research efforts are expected to be fruitful and most probably will open up new opportunities in the field of oncolytic virotherapy.",
