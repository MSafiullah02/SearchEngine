Enteroviruses and Herpes simplex virus were isolated in 20 patients. Etiologic agents were not identified in 853 patients. We also demonstrated the number of positives for isolation of pathogens or detection of viral antigens. The rate of isolation of measles virus (100%) was the highest, while that of parainfluenza virus (9.9%) was the lowest.

            "text": "The role of virus infections in acute respiratory illnesses is common world\u2010wide. Denny et al.\n\n6\n reported that infants usually had seven or eight respiratory illnesses each year, on average, and the frequency decreased by age in the day\u2010care setting in the US. The incidence of infections peaked at 7\u201312 months of life and less than 10% of infections involved the lower respiratory tract. Viral pathogens were recovered in 31% of cases and the frequent isolates were RS virus, parainfluenza virus (particularly type 3), adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus and influenza virus with less frequency. The number of patients hospitalized for respiratory infections is limited and, thus, the results of the pathogens responsible may depend on the study design. Anderson et al.\n\n19\n reported that RS virus was isolated as yearly outbreaks; parainfluenza virus 1 and 2 infections occurred every other year in the autumn; parainfluenza virus type 3 isolation occurred throughout the year; and influenza virus isolation occurred as yearly winter outbreaks. A strong correlation between RS virus outbreaks and lower respiratory tract infection deaths was reported in patients aged 1\u201311 months; influenza virus infections were correlated with lower respiratory deaths of infants aged 24\u201359 months. However, no relationship was reported between parainfluenza virus infections and lower respiratory deaths. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most important viral lower respiratory tract pathogen in infants and children in developed countries and it usually circulates from late autumn to early spring in temperate climates. Viral agents in lower respiratory infections are common in developed and developing countries. Epidemiological studies have been conducted in hospitalized children in Bangladesh, The Philippines, Thailand and Uruguay.\n11\n, 12, 13, \n\u201314\n However, these reports were limited to a survey of only a few years. De Arruda et al.\n\n20\n reported the role of respiratory viruses in a 29 month household\u2010based follow up of 175 children under 5 years of age in north\u2010east Brazil. Respiratory tract viruses were isolated in 35% and, of these isolates, 45.6% were rhinoviruses, 16% were parainfluenza viruses, 15.8% were enteroviruses, 9.9% were adenoviruses, 7.0% were Herpes simplex viruses and 5.7% were influenza virus. Furthermore, these authors demonstrated that the peaks of influenza and parainfluenza virus activity were related to rainfall, but that rhinovirus activity was not. We investigated a longitudinal hospital\u2010based survey of respiratory infectious diseases in Tokyo. During our 6 years study, RS and influenza virus infections were observed in the winter season, parainfluenza virus type 3 was observed in the spring, M. pneumoniae was observed in summer and autumn, but adenovirus circulated without seasonal differences and the seasonal pattern was slightly different from that in the US, depending on climate differences. Constant seasonal patterns of viral respiratory infection have been reported in developed countries.\n5\n\n,\n\n6\n\n,\n\n19\n\n,\n\n21\n Essentially the same seasonal pattern has been reported for the Northern hemisphere. As for the distribution of agents in different age groups, RS was mainly responsible for pathogenic agents in children under 5 years of age, parainfluenza was observed in infants 9\u201312 months of age, influenza virus and M. pneumonia were dominant agents in children over 5 years of age.",

The rate of isolation of parainfluenza viruses was not sufficient in the present study, but we are uncertain for the reason for this. When virus isolation or detection of viral antigens was not used, etiological agents of the respiratory illness remained unidentified in approximately more than half the cases in children under 1 year of age.",
