            "text": "Habitat loss and degradation are among the most important threats to global diversity (Groom, Meffe & Carroll, 2006). To counteract species loss, the conservation of a broad range of natural and seminatural habitats in good quality \u2013 in line with the goals of the European Union Directive \u2013 is essential. For the maintenance of high diversity in Europe, the conservation of dry sand ecosystems is important. Dry sand ecosystems such as inland dunes, dry grasslands as well as dry Calluna\u2010, Genista\u2010 and Empetrum nigrum\u2010heathlands (excluding humid Erica tetralix\u2010heathlands) are characterized by extreme habitat conditions including nutrient poverty, shifting sand, sparse vegetation and a dry and hot microclimate. Central European dry sand ecosystems are endangered habitats listed in Annex I of the European Habitats Directive (FFH 2310, 2320, 2330, 4030, 6110, 6120; Riecken et al., 2006) which harbour a specialized flora and fauna, including a remarkable number of endangered species (Lehmann et al., 2004a,b; Maes & Bonte, 2006; Buchholz, 2010).",

            "text": "In Central Europe dry sand ecosystems are mainly anthropo\u2010zoogenic habitats that have developed as a result of traditional land management such as sheep grazing, sod cutting and burning (Webb, 1998). Over the last 50 years the number of such ecosystems has decreased, resulting in highly fragmented and isolated patches of low habitat quality (Verb\u00fccheln & J\u00f6bges, 2000; Pardey, 2004). The main reasons for this reduction are the abandonment of traditional land use, intensive cultivation and afforestation. As a consequence, disturbance effects such as drifting sand, grazing and fire, which are the most important drivers of habitat dynamics, have decreased (White & Jentsch, 2001; Jentsch et al., 2002), thus promoting succession towards shrub\u2010 and tree\u2010dominated vegetation (Webb, 1998; Provoost, Jones & Edmondson, 2011). Succession is further enhanced by increasing amounts of atmospheric nitrogen deposition which cause eutrophication and grass encroachment (Roem, Klees & Berendse, 2002).",

Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) are known to be useful indicator taxa to analyse shifts in terrestrial ecosystems (Schirmel, 2010; Koivula, 2011; Kotze et al., 2011; Schirmel & Buchholz, 2011) including European dry grasslands and heathlands (e.g. Falke & Assmann, 1997, 2001; Mossakowski, Fr\u00e4mbs & Baro, 1999; Irmler, 2004). Carabid species of dry and poor grasslands and heathlands \u2013 especially specialized and endangered ones \u2013 have decreased significantly in the past (Desender & Turin, 1989; Kotze & O'Hara, 2003) and thus it is imperative to evaluate current degradation processes in remaining dry sand ecosystems. In particular, we were interested in (1) how succession and the environmental parameters associated with it influence carabid assemblages, (2) to what extent typical xerophilic species assemblages still exist and (3) what is required for a successful habitat management.",

The landscape was glacially formed with fluvial and aeolic ice\u2010age top layers showing dry soil conditions (Dinter, 1999). The climate is sub\u2010Atlantic with a mean annual temperature of 9.5 to 10\u00b0C and an annual precipitation between 700 and 750 mm. The lowlands are mainly managed for agricultural use (Dinter, 1999). Open sand habitats occur mostly on military training sites which significantly contribute to the preservation of these habitats (e.g. the military training area \u2018Senne\u2019 comprises about 2000 ha Calluna heathland and about 350 ha dry grassland) (Pardey, 2004). Due to the shutdown of most military training sites in the last years the open sand habitats undergo succession. This is the same in the cultivated landscape where traditional land\u2010use forms were abandoned many years ago (Pardey, 2004; Steven, 2004).",

Four uncovered pitfall traps were installed randomly at each site and were open from August 2006 to July 2008. Minimum distance between traps was 5 m. Pitfall trap catches can be biased by numerous factors, for example trap design, sampling protocol (Buchholz et al., 2010; Schirmel et al., 2010) as well as differing habitat structure and activity rates (Topping & Sunderland, 1992). Pitfall trapping is a selective method yielding activity rather than true densities of ground\u2010dwelling arthropods (Lang, 2000). Nevertheless, the method is commonly applied for sampling epigeic invertebrates as it provides large data sets that allow statistically sound analyses (Southwood & Henderson, 2000).",

These degradation processes are clearly reflected in the ground beetle distribution found in this study. Although typical dry grassland and drift sand species still occur on a few sites, the habitat conditions of most sites have deteriorated (Pardey, 2004). The representatives of xerophilic carabid species were Am. fulva, Am. spreta, Cala. ambiguus, Cici. hybrida and H. rufipalpis (species of group 4) and Bro. cephalotes and H. flavescens (unique to DS and DG). These species are characteristic for young, dynamic habitats with low and sparse vegetation (Turin, 2000) and formed a unique assemblage of xerophilic habitat specialists with a high proportion of endangered species (Figs 1 and 2). All these species responded negatively to increasing vegetation cover and humidity and are particularly threatened by succession. Carabid species turnover during dry grassland succession is symptomatic not only for the investigated area but also for the lowlands of northern and northwestern Germany (Falke & Assmann, 1997, 2001; Lehmann et al., 2004a) and Western Europe (Desender & Turin, 1989; Kotze & O'Hara, 2003).

Carabid distribution reflected these habitat shifts by the increased occurrence of mesophilic grassland species (e.g. Am. lunicollis).

Typical species more related to dry conditions were Am. tibialis, Bembidion nigricorne, Cici. campestris, and H. anxius (group 3), while Agonum muelleri, Ansiodactylus binotatus, Bembidion lampros and Bra. harpalinus were typical in habitats with higher humidity (group 2). Bra. ruficollis was a unique species to Calluna heathland. Heathland species are favoured by the (at least scattered) occurrence of dwarf\u2010shrub vegetation (Call. vulgaris) which, for example provides shelter, food and adequate microclimate (Mossakowski et al., 1999). Dwarf\u2010shrubs depend on habitat dynamics (e.g. grazing or burning) and therefore heathland carabid species should generally benefit from habitat dynamics, too.",

The importance of these habitats with respect to species conservation is additionally highlighted by the occurrence of a very high proportion of endangered species. More than 50% of the typical species found in drift sands, dry grasslands and heathlands (group 3 and 4) are classified as endangered. Species occurring in these ecosystems are mainly xerophilic and tended to be more stenotopic (Fig. 2). As also described in earlier studies xerophilic carabid species are highly threatened by succession and habitat decline (Desender & Turin, 1989; Mathiak, Schultz & Ringel, 2004). This might be most critical since, firstly, some dry grassland carabid species have a low dispersal potential (Lehmann et al., 2004b) and thus are not able to migrate, secondly, these species are dependent on sufficient habitat size (Falke & Assmann, 1997, 2001; Drees et al., 2011), and, finally, negative succession effects are most pronounced in small\u2010sized habitats (Webb & Hopkins, 1984). Typical assemblages of open dry sand ecosystems therefore run the risk of going extinct or at least losing their uniqueness as specialized xerophilic species fail to appear (Price, 2003).",

Achieving a good conservation status of these habitats is moreover requested by the European Habitats Directive.

In earlier times, these habitat conditions were maintained by anthropogenic disturbance due to traditional land use (H\u00e4rdtle et al., 2009; Schwabe & Kratochwil, 2009). Nowadays, it is in the hand of conservationists, land managers and policy makers to seek for appropriate management and restoration strategies (Schwabe & Kratochwil, 2009; Brooks et al., 2012). Therefore, precise knowledge of species habitat preferences \u2013 as provided for carabids in the present study \u2013 is fundamental.

            "text": "Grazing is a fundamental and attractive option for dry grassland and heathland management (Gimingham, 1992) although it is difficult to organize on small patches (Webb, 1998). The impact varies depending on herbivore\u2010based factors (e.g. digestive morphology, body size, incisor morphology, foraging and herding behaviour), plant\u2010based factors (e.g. plant quality and quantity, plant distribution, interaction between plant quality and quantity and livestock behaviour) and site\u2010based factors (e.g. shelter, water, site characteristics) (for extensive descriptions see Lake, Bullock & Hartley, 2001 or Brunzel\u2010Dr\u00fcke et al., 2008). For example, cattle and ponies are less suitable for Calluna heathlands and play only a minor role in scrub management, but can be effective in reducing invasive grasses or creating bare sand patches by trampling in dry grasslands (Lake et al., 2001; Tsch\u00f6pe et al., 2004). Sheep are usually best for heath grazing as they feed on grasses in summer and on dwarf\u2010shrubs in winter (Gimingham, 1992; Lake et al., 2001). Goats can play a major role in scrub management (Lake et al., 2001). Apart from livestock species, stocking rates and flock management as well as frequency (e.g. annual, one year in three), timing and duration affect grazing impacts (van Wieren, 1998; Lake et al., 2001; Offer, Edwards & Edgar, 2003; Schwabe & Kratochwil, 2009) and it has to be considered that these effects may vary between seasons, sites and years (Lake et al., 2001). In general, stocking rates should not be too high and several authors suggest a moderate or extensive grazing intensity (Kirby, 1992; Dennis et al., 1997; van Wieren, 1998; Bell, Wheater & Cullen, 2001; Wurth, 2002). In this context, Lake et al. (2001) emphasize that both, over or undergrazing, should be avoided and they estimate the current stocking rates for lowland heathland management at 0.03 up to 0.50 LU ha\u22121 yr\u22121 [(no. of livestock \u00d7 livestock unit equivalence \u00d7 proportion of year grazed)/grazing unit area]. In contrast, Offer et al. (2003) recommend high grazing densities over short periods in localized areas to periodically reset succession since long\u2010term extensive systems are often unrewarding. They state that populations of most organisms can better cope with occasional, localized catastrophic events than regular, individually small but widespread, disruptive events (as provided by low\u2010density, year\u2010round grazing). However, although applying a reasonable and well\u2010conceived grazing system, grazing impacts are negative on habitat features (e.g. vegetation cover) certain invertebrates depend on (Newton et al., 2009). This may lead to declines in overall diversity and ecological types (e.g. group 1 species in this study). Thus, even within reserves, conflicts can arise as a result of the management requirements of different taxa (Bakker & Berendse, 1999).",

            "text": "One should consider that domestic grazers may not (alone) be able to eliminate or open up the dense shrub vegetation in heavily degenerated Calluna and Juniperus heaths. In fact, problems may arise when using grazing for scrub management; in that case, overly high stocking rates or long grazing periods are likely to produce excessive disruption to features important for invertebrates (Offer et al., 2003). Thus, in highly degraded dry sand ecosystems it might be more promising to remove the herb and topsoil layers mechanically prior to grazing (Diemont & Lindhorst Homan, 1989; Jansen et al., 2004; Maes & Bonte, 2006). Although topsoil removal represents a very intense intervention in the soil structure, it is a valuable initial management technique leading to redynamization that benefits habitat specialists in contrast to many eurytopic species (Den Boer & van Dijk, 1994; Sieren & Fischer, 2002; Schirmel, 2010). Cutting (including choppering) is well suited to reduce grasses and herbs in heathland (Prochnow, Brunk & Segert, 2004). Cutting can be a useful alternative to burning in small areas or where burning is unacceptable but the impact depends on cutting technique (pedestrian\u2010operated machines, tractor drawn machines), cutting intensity and timing as well as storage of debris (Gimingham, 1992). The rapid change of site conditions (reduction of vegetation height, higher temperature and lower humidity and shading) caused by cutting may have a drastic impact on invertebrates (Bell et al., 2001). While loss of plant architecture is more important for phytophagous species and spiders, carabid species may be affected by a reduced prey availability since cutting can reduce Collembola densities (Purvis & Curry, 1981). However, given that an extensive cutting is applied during midsummer in patches, it is suitable to preserve typical heathland carabid assemblages (Melber, 1993; Prochnow et al., 2004; Schirmel, 2010).",

            "text": "Burning has been widely used for heathland management as it is an effective method to deplete nutrients and to maintain succession (Webb, 1997, 1998). However, burning is very complex and many factors have to be considered before and while applying this technique (e.g. local climate and weather conditions, size, water content and chemistry of the burn material, fire behaviour, burning season) (Warren, Scifres & Teel, 1987; Gimingham, 1992). Post\u2010burn grasslands and heathlands often encourage invertebrate diversity and it has been proven that the amount of xerophilic and stenotopic species increases while eurytopic species decline (Gardner & Usher, 1989; Usher, 1992; Bell et al., 2001; Schmidt & Melber, 2004). Although many mobile species can escape to neighbouring habitats or burrows (the moss, litter and upper soil layers provide excellent insulation) burning may negatively affect the invertebrate fauna more especially phytophagous species (Warren et al., 1987; Bell et al., 2001). It is therefore, important that unburned refuges are left and that the time between burns is long enough to ensure a recolonization (Harper et al., 2000).",

            "text": "Our findings highlight that a successful conservation will preserve not only endangered habitats but also a distinct carabid fauna. It is most important to consider possible advantages and disadvantages of the management techniques described above from a carabidologists perspective. Carabids (and so other invertebrates) have very specific habitat requirements and to maximize carabid diversity, dry sand ecosystems should have a range of vegetation types and a variety of habitat structure. Thus, successful habitat management must consider spatially and temporally heterogeneous habitat mosaics. Patches of bare ground are essential to provide a dry and hot microclimate and shifting sand dynamics. Cameron & Leather (2012) suggested a broad variety of patch sizes whereas patch size should extend with increasing grass density at patch edges. However, apart from bare patches \u2013 which undoubtedly promote euxerophilic or xerophilic dry grassland species (see group 4 species) \u2013 a side by side existence of different successional stages will have a big benefit for invertebrate conservation as it increases overall diversity and promotes heathland species (see group 2 and 3 species) (Lake et al., 2001; Schirmel, Blindow & Fartmann, 2010; Woodcock & Pywell, 2010; Schirmel & Buchholz, 2011; Cameron & Leather, 2012). Grazing is preferable to cutting and burning, and from an carabidologists perspective, we suggest an initial short\u2010term rotational high density grazing with cattle in degenerated sites \u2013 maybe combined with topsoil removing or cutting \u2013 to promote xerophilic dry grassland species and a low or moderate density grazing by sheep and goats that benefits heathland species (Supporting Information http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acv.12046/suppinfo). It is most important to weigh up the pros and cons of burning. Burning is expensive, labour\u2010intensive and rather unsuitable for small dry grassland and heathland patches.",
