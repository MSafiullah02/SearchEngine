BRSV causes respiratory disease, mostly in young animals, but can affect cattle of all ages (Valarcher and Taylor, 2007). Clinical signs vary from none to severe (Valarcher and Taylor, 2007). BCV is responsible for diarrhea in calves, and for respiratory disease and contagious diarrhea in adult cattle (winter dysentery) (Boileau and Kapil, 2010). These infections lead to increased use of antibiotics due to common secondary bacterial infections, they reduce animal welfare and the associated economic losses can be considerable (Larsen, 2000; Boileau and Kapil, 2010). In 2016, a national control program against BRSV and BCV was launched in Norway, as the first country in the world. The program is conducted as a joint initiative amongst producer organizations, and participation is voluntary. In early 2016, bulk tank milk (BTM) was collected from the majority of Norwegian dairy herds and analyzed for BRSV and BCV antibodies. In a previous study, dairy herds in two counties on the west coast of Norway had also been sampled and tested three years earlier (Toftaker et al., 2016).",

            "text": "A key strategy of the control program is to protect uninfected herds by imposing restrictions on livestock trade. A negative herd status based on BTM lasts for one year after testing, regardless of the degree of contact with other herds. In a previous Norwegian study, it was shown that spread of BRSV between herds was rapid i.e. the elimination rates and introduction rates were high (Klem et al., 2013). Transmission dynamics for BCV has not yet been investigated in Norway, although one study describes a regional outbreak of winter dysentery (Toftaker et al., 2017). Studies from Sweden have shown that recent BCV infection is common, indicating that the infection is easily transmitted (Beaudeau et al., 2010; Ohlson et al., 2013). Due to the constant risk of virus introduction, the assumption that a negative status is valid for a long time is questionable. Several factors can affect the risk of change in status. Purchase of livestock is a well-known route of introduction of infectious agents, and herds that frequently purchase animals are likely at a higher risk of seroconversion (Elvander, 1996; Fr\u00f6ssling et al., 2012; Toftaker et al., 2016). In addition to purchase of animals, previous studies have shown that location and herd size are important risk factors for BRSV- and/or BCV antibody positivity (Ohlson et al., 2010b; Toftaker et al., 2016)",

More et al. (2013) applied this methodology at herd level within the Irish control program for Johne\u2019s disease. They included information on livestock trade along with test results to calculate probability of freedom from Johne\u2019s disease in test-negative herds. In Norway, information on location of herds, herd size and livestock trade are available from central directories. It was hypothesized that this information could be used along with test results to provide updated estimates of herd probability of freedom from antibodies reflecting the status more accurately than previous BTM test results alone. Estimating a time-varying probability of freedom could potentially form a tool for risk assessment in livestock trade or provide the basis for a risk-based approach to sampling.",

Samples were analyzed following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions as described by Toftaker et al. (2016). A cut-off value of 10 percent positivity (PP) was used for both tests, according to the test manual (Svanova, 2018a,b). From 2016, all samples were analyzed with the new MVD-Enferplex BCV/BRSV multiplex, hereafter referred to as the multiplex. This test detects BRSV and BCV antibodies simultaneously using a panel of two recombinant proteins and two synthetic peptides for BRSV (BRSV-A -D) along with one recombinant protein (BCV-A) for BCV, as antigens. A positive test response results in chemiluminescence, captured by an imaging system, and measured in relative light units (RLU) by the Quansys Q view software (v 1.5.4.7). Antigens were combined in a parallel reading, i.e. the test was considered positive when the RLU-value of at least one antigen was above the cut-off. The applied cut-off values for the four different BRSV-antigens were: 2000 for BRSV-A, 4000 for BRSV-B, 7000 for BRSV-C and 1700 for BRSV-D. For BCV-A a cut-off value of 10,000 was used. The sensitivity (Se) of the multiplex was set to 0.94 for BRSV and 0.995 BCV. The Se was set to 0.998 for the SVANOVIR\u00ae BRSV-Ab and 0.999 for SVANOVIR\u00ae BCV-Ab. Test parameters at the applied cut-off values were based on a diagnostic test evaluation study, evaluating the multiplex along with the SVANOVIR\u00ae BRSV-Ab and SVANOVIR\u00ae BCV for BTM (Toftaker et al., 2018).",

This factor was estimated using the proportion of herds that were negative at the first sampling (2013) and positive at the last sampling (2016), in the group that did not purchase animals, hereafter designated closed herds. This was done separately for the two viruses and for the two counties as we knew that the prevalence, and likely the infectious pressure, was higher in the northern county (Toftaker et al., 2016). In addition, herd size was taken into account as several studies have found an association between herd size and seropositivity (Norstr\u00f6m et al., 2000; Sol\u00eds-Calder\u00f3n et al., 2007; Ohlson et al., 2010b; Toftaker et al., 2016). In the study by Toftaker et al. (2016) conducted in the same region, the odds of testing positive increased with 12% across the inter quartile range of herd size. The effect of herd size was the same for both viruses. Based on this, we divided the study herds into two groups with median herd size as cut-point and assigned a value of PIntroLocal 12% higher in the \u201clarge\u201d compared to the small herds. In summary, this resulted in four categories of PIntroLocal for each virus based on herd size below or above median, and which county the herd was located in (north/south). The total probability of introduction through animal purchase and by indirect transmission for each time period t was then calculated:(3)PIntroTotalt=1- ((1-PIntroTradet) \u00d7(1-PIntroLocal))\n",

For both infections, PostPFree of a test-negative herd was high immediately after a negative test, reflecting the high sensitivity of the tests, but gradually decreased with time. It is intuitive that the confidence of freedom from infection will decrease with time since sampling, as long as there is a risk of introduction. The advantage of our approach is that it offers a quantification of this decrease in confidence, through the regularly updated PostPFree resulting in herd specific slopes over time based on purchase of livestock, location of the herd and herd size (Fig. 3). Based on our calculations, the effect of the local factor was small compared to the effect of purchasing livestock, which had a large impact on the probability of freedom. Large differences in PostPFree were observed in the study herds at the end of the study period, depending on to which extent the individual herd had purchased animals. When herds that were test negative in 2013 were retested in 2016, 29% had changed antibody status to positive, and even though this proportion was likely lower after only one year (when retesting is required), this indicated that, in many cases, inferring a herd\u2019s current status from an old BTM sample is problematic. Because most herds in the present study were not retested until 2016, a validation before this point was not possible. Consequently, we could only assess the overall performance of the method across three years, and not assess any variations between years. If implemented in the ongoing control program a continuous evaluation of the tool would be advisable so that adjustments can be made accordingly.",

This was expected, as previous studies have indicated that the relative importance of purchase of livestock is higher for BCV than for BRSV (Fr\u00f6ssling et al., 2012; Toftaker et al., 2016). The reason for the low estimated PIntroLocal was that few of the initially negative, closed herds seroconverted during the study period, 27% for BRSV and 18% for BCV. When herds purchasing animals also were included, 29% of the previously negative herds changed status to positive for each of the viruses. This is within the same range as in a Swedish study where between 11.1 and 66.7% of different categories of study herds went from BCV antibody negative to positive during a three-year period, when herd classification where based on pooled samples of primiparous cows (Ohlson et al., 2013). Only two herds had a negative BTM test. Even though the total study period was the same as in the current study, some herds did not become negative until after the study had started, thus the time at risk for each herd differed. Compared to our results for BRSV, Klem et al. (2013) found a considerably higher introduction rate (42%) over a period of only six months in a previous Norwegian study. However, the latter study differed from the present in two important aspects; it used a random sample of herds from the national dairy population, and herd classification was based on serum samples from a group of young stock. The difference in introduction rates could therefore be due to regional differences in disease occurrence and dynamics, and/or it might reflect that BTM negative herds represent a low risk stratum of the population. A negative BTM test means that the herd has likely been free from circulating virus for a long time, as animals continue to produce antibodies several years after infection (Alenius et al., 1991; Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 2001; Klem et al., 2014). If a herd has managed to stay free from infection for many years, it might have certain characteristics that makes it likely to remain free. PIntroLocal was used as a parameter for transmission through other routes than officially recorded animal movements. Indirect transfer via fomites is likely the most important factor, however, direct animal contact is possible e.g. on shared pastures, or if animals are temporarily moved (without change in ownership).",

The sensitivity analysis showed that the change in output (PostPFree) was moderate when PIntroLocal was increased or decreased with 50%, suggesting that if the true rate of local transmission is very different from the estimated local factor, this could affect the predictive ability of the model. It seems likely that local differences in prevalence and geographically dependent risk factors such as herd density might cause important differences in PIntroLocal. Differences in the importance of local transmission should therefore be investigated for different regions if the presented framework is to be applied at a national scale.",

When individual samples are used for herd classification the time span reflected by a positive test, in terms of time of exposure to virus, is shorter compared to using BTM. The length of the time span will depend on the age of the tested animals, i.e. young stock will reflect a shorter time period than primiparous cows. There might also be differences between categories of herds based on other factors, such as biosecurity level, production type, and herd size. The herd size in the study region is smaller than the national average (Anonymous, 2017), hence herds categorized as \u201clarge\u201d in the present study, are small even in a Norwegian context. A different cut-off between large and small herds, or more categories of herd size might be appropriate for application at a larger scale.",

Animal purchase might mean introducing an antibody positive animal and not necessarily introducing virus. As Norwegian herds are small the purchase of a single antibody positive lactating cow will likely suffice to produce a positive BTM test. Because we used BTM testing as the \u201cgold standard\u201d the herd would be classified as a \u201ctrue positive\u201d in the validation. Altogether, it is important to keep in mind that serologic classification in general as well as the output of our model (PostPFree) likely overestimates the proportion of herds in which there is actual virus circulation. Therefore, the estimated PostPFree from antibodies is likely lower than the true probability of freedom from circulating virus. However, the consequences of a positive test result in the control program is the same, regardless of why there are test-positive animals in a herd.",

Another indication of the usefulness of PostPFree was the clear differences in proportion of test positive herds between the first and fourth quartile of PostPFree as shown in Fig. 4. When assessing PostPInf as a diagnostic test we showed how many herds would be correctly classified at different cut-off values of PostPInf. In a practical setting, this is equal to the expected proportion of true positive herds that is detected if retesting is recommended at a certain value of PostPInf (PostPFree). If used on close to real time data, one could decide on a cut-off, and have an alarm when PostPFree drops below this value. This could enable timely intervention and a more risk-based approach to sampling and re-testing of herds. The relative Se (cut-off PostPInf >0.25) was lower for BCV than for BRSV suggesting that a more stringent cut-off might be appropriate for BCV if used for targeted sampling.
