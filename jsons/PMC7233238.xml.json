            "text": "Studies on Covid-19 disease that appeared in December 2019 are limited. Many of these limited studies are for the recognition of the Covid-19 virus [13,14]. Also, some studies have been conducted on the effects of this disease on humans [[15], [16], [17], [18], [19]]. At the same time, the treatment of the Coronavirus and the processes occurring after it have been examined by Zhang et al. In the study, the possible conditions of the patient who was treated on Covid-19 disease and discharged were examined [2]. Covid-19 was examined in terms of dermatologists by Darlenski and Tsankov. They presented the effects of extreme hygiene measures on the skin and the factors that dermatologists will consider in this regard [20]. Chen et al. focused on the prevent that can be taken for the Covid-19 virus and the success of a new type of treatment. The effect of mesenchymal stem cell therapy on the Covid-19 virus was interpreted with this study, and it was emphasized that it would be an alternative for treatment [21]. Holland et al. presented the kit developed by emergency doctors to protect against the Covid-19 virus [22]. On the other hand, Yang et al. examined the possible effects of the Covid-19 virus on children and their future [23]. The study emphasized the importance of protection prevent in children with other chronic conditions, and it was also emphasized that newborns should be isolated. Lai et al. presented symptoms of coronavirus and pneumonia in their studies. In this study, it was found that it was mostly infected in adult patients. Ways to protect against this virus are presented [9]. Li et al. investigated the genetic evolution and source of the Covid-19 virus [24]. These studies are currently limited in the literature and are expected to increase rapidly since the Covid-19 virus has just been introduced and the available data are not sufficient. However, symptoms of Covid-19 disease are similar to those of pneumonia, and a certain percentage of deaths due to the Covid-19 virus are on Pneumonia disease. There are many studies on the classification of Pneumonia disease with intelligent systems in the literature. Togacar et al. [25] have presented an intelligent classification system for Pneumonia disease. Chest radiographs were used for this study. In this study, deep learning methods were used and the results were presented by using AlexNet, VGG-16, and VGG-19 neural network models. The accuracy values for the selected dataset have resulted in 99.41%. Sousa et al. [26] provided automatic pneumonia diagnosis in infants through computer-aided systems from radiographic images. In this system, pneumonia data is classified using three classifiers. The classifiers used are Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbor and Na\u00efve Bayes. In this study, it was determined that the most suitable classifier for the available data is Support Vector Machines. Pneumonia disease was identified and classified by chest x-ray images by Jaiswal et al. [27]. In this study, deep convolutional neural network method was used. The main purpose of using this method is to provide an effective acquisition of local and global features of chest X-ray images. In this study, NIH CXR14 [28] dataset was used. In the study, the evaluation parameter mean threshold value and mean score was selected. Liang and Zheng [29] have developed a smart system for child Pneumonia disease. The convolutional neural network method was used in the developed system and the performance of Kermany [30] dataset was used. In this study, accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and AUC were used as evaluation criteria. The accuracy value was calculated as 90.5% in the proposed method. Sirazitdinov et al. interpreted chest x-ray images with machine learning techniques. RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset [31] was used in the study. In the study, precision, recall, F1-score were used to evaluate the results.",

The main aim of the LBP is to extract local features for achieving global optimum features. Therefore, LBP divide image into 3 \u200b\u00d7 \u200b3 sized overlapping blocks to extract neighborhood relations. The steps of the LBP are given below [34].\nStep 0: Load input image with the size of WxH. Wand Hare the width and height of the image.\nStep 1: Divide the input image into 3 \u200b\u00d7 \u200b3 sized overlapping block and obtain (W\u22122)x(H\u22122)blocks.\nStep 2: Extract binary features from each block by using signum function. The description of the signum function is mathematically shown below.\n(1)bit(k)=signum(np,cp)={0,np<cp1,np\u2265cp,k={1,2,\u2026,8}where npis a neighbor pixel, cp defines center pixel of the 3 \u200b\u00d7 \u200b3 sized block. In the 3 \u200b\u00d7 \u200b3 sized block, there are 8 neighbor pixels and a center pixel. Therefore, 8 bits are extracted from a pixel.\nStep 3: Convert bits to a decimal value.\n(2)value(m,t)=\u2211k=18bit(k)\u221728\u2212k,m={1,2,\u2026,W\u22122},t={1,2,\u2026,H\u22122}\n\nStep 4: Construct a LBP implemented image by using values.\nStep 5: Extract histogram of the LBP implemented image. The extracted histogram is utilized as feature. LBP extract 256 features because LBP implemented image is coded with 8-bit. A graphical explanation of the LBP is shown in Fig. 1\n[35,36].\n",

The advantages of the LBP are given as follows. LBP extracts discriminative features, has low computational complexity and application of it is easy because it has a basic algorithm. Because of these advantages, we selected LBP as feature extractor. The main problem of the LBP is to extract low-level features. Therefore, we proposed a residual and exemplar model to extract low, medium and high-level features. The procedure of the ResExLBP is shown in Algorithm 2.\n",
