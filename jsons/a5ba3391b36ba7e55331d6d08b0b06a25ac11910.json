The previous and posterior evolutions to the quarantine policy are modeled in a separate way by considering different complexities parameters in each stage. Application of this model to COVID-19 data in different countries is implemented.

In contrast to other approaches, we consider that the initial free epidemical growth and its posterior constrained evolution (due to quarantine) must be described in intrinsic separate ways. In fact, both stages are determined by different mechanisms whose underlying complexities may be quite dissimilar. The proposed evolution is defined with a minimal number of parameters whose estimation follows from data fitting and also public information. In the pre-quarantine period the dynamic is linear while in the post-quarantine stage the model can be related to a linearized SIR model. The approach is applied to available data of different European countries and Argentina. The maximal number of infected agents as well as the size of the epidemic peak are estimated in each case. A qualitative description of post-quarantine scenarios in terms of the fraction of isolated population is also proposed.",

In this first period, where no local governmental policy has been taken yet, the growth of the (total) infected population n(t) results from external injection plus local contagions. These features depend on a complex way on flight connectivity and local passenger displacements, which in turn may lead to very different average behaviors. For example, the infected population may grow in an exponential (Latino American countries) or sub-exponential way (some European countries). Given the increase of infected people, in a second period local governments take different policies such as total or partial quarantine (avoiding local spread), jointly with the cancellation (partial or full) of infected external injection. In our approach, due to their intrinsic different origins, these two stages are modeled in a separate way.",

For example, from [3] , we writeS and I are the number of susceptible and infected persons respectively. The rate \u03ba 0 measures the removed agents due to quarantine, while the rate \u03ba measures the removed infected people. The constant \u03b1 and \u03b2 have the usual meaning in SIR models [1, 2] . The previous non-linear evolution can be linearized under the condition \u03b1SI \u226a \u03ba 0 S. Thus, it follows that S \u2243 s 0 exp(\u2212\u03ba 0 t). Under the mapping r q (t) = \u03b1s 0 e \u2212\u03ba0t and\u03c4 \u22121 = (\u03b2 + \u03ba 0 + \u03ba), we recover the proposal Eq. (9), n I (t) \u2194 I.",
