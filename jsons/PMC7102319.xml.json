It was first described in 1939 but the knowledge about this syndrome is still quite limited due to the small sample size of patients, which makes a study extremely challenging [2]. It presents in patients of all ages, more commonly in children. No data are available concerning its global prevalence. Primary forms of HLH usually appear within the first 3 months of life, and it is equally present in both genders [3]. In the adult population, it is slightly more common in males [4].",

Children tend to present higher concentrations (levels >10,000 ng/mL have a specificity of 95 %) in contrast to adults, whose levels usually remain around 2000 ng/mL. Older patients are also likely to suffer from other causes that can justify this elevation, such as concomitant infections, sepsis or organ failure, which makes hyperferritinemia less specific.
