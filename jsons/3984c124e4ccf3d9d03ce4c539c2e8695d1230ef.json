To regulate many aspects of this process, cells of the immune system utilise protease activity. One major group of cysteine proteases, termed cathepsins, are common constituents of the endolysosomal compartments of immune cells where they have critical roles in events such as antigen presentation and zymogen processing. Despite a widely held belief that the cathepsins were enzymes that function only at the acidic pH within the lysosomal compartment, it is now evident that they also operate in the cytosolic and nuclear compartments of cells, as well as the extracellular space. 1 As a result of this widespread localisation, cathepsins can exert diverse effects on the development and regulation of immune responses by playing key roles in cytokine regulation, cell GHYHORSPHQW LQGXFWLRQ RI DSRSWRVLV DQG LQ\u00c0XHQFLQJ 7ROOOLNH UHFHSWRU 7/5 VLJQDOOLQJ 1, 2 Many pathogenic organisms synthesize proteases that resemble host cathepsins (Table  1) , both functionally and structurally and have fundamental roles in the life-cycle and survival of the pathogen.

Instead, it requires the detection of enzymatic activity associated with the presence of a pathogen or antigen. The immune outcome closely resembles the type of reaction that is triggered by helminths and has led to the suggestion that the innate immune system has evolved a detection mechanism based on sensing the abnormal protease activity associated with helminth infection. 18 This idea has support in studies showing that the secreted proteases of the hookworm Necator americanus induce Type 2 cytokine production by basophils. 19 Another means by which cysteine proteases could modulate host immune responses towards a Th2 environment may be associated with their ability to inhibit Th1 immune responses. In support of this idea, it was shown that the predominant secreted product of the human and animal helminth pathogen Fasciola hepatica, a cathepsin L1 cysteine protease, suppressed the onset of protective Th1 immune responses in mice to infections with the respiratory microbe Bordetella pertussis, making them more susceptible to disease. In addition, injection of the cysteine protease immediately prior to immunization of mice with a B. pertussis whole-cell pertussis vaccine prevented the development of a Th1 response to the vaccine. [20] [21] [22] Studies with L. mexicana cathepsin B suggest that cleavage of CD25 from the surface of T-cells may prevent the development of Th1 responses. 14 Infection with the helminth Schistosoma mansoni may provide another example of how cysteine proteases suppress Th1 responses. The acute stages of schistosomiasis leads to the development of a weak Th1 response, but this switches to a potent Th2 response when female worms become fecund and release eggs that get trapped in host liver and intestinal tissues. 23 Secretions from the trapped eggs are responsible for the induction of this Th2 response.
