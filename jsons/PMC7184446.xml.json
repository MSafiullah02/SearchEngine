C. difficile has a 2-phase life cycle with dormant spores germinating into toxin-producing vegetative bacteria, which leads to colitis [7]. Although the factors that initiate germination are incompletely understood, bile acids play an important role [6]. Primary bile acids, which are synthesized in the liver and secreted into the gastrointestinal tract, set up favorable conditions for germination. By contrast, secondary bile acids, the metabolic product of key commensal bacteria, inhibit vegetative bacterial growth [5]. These and other key microbe-derived metabolites are reduced when antibiotics kill innocent bystander bacteria, which are critical to these metabolic processes. For example, a relative increase of primary to secondary bile acid concentrations facilitates spore germination and vegetative outgrowth, leading to recurrence. Furthermore, CDI-targeted antibiotics maintain and exacerbate this low-diversity microbiome (ie, dysbiosis) [8]. Thus, antibiotics are a main driver of compositional and functional microbiome changes and are insufficient as a sole therapeutic strategy, as microbiome recovery is essential for durable clinical resolution. Other potential mechanisms that inhibit C. difficile include niche exclusion, competition for nutrients, and bacteriocins [6].",

Trials performed before NAAT availability (eg, fidaxomicin) relied exclusively on toxin testing [27]. More recent trials have allowed detection of either toxin production (enzyme immunoassay) or toxin genes (polymerase chain reaction) according to investigator discretion, which may have led to inappropriate subject selection [28]. Crucially, to date, no randomized, placebo-controlled FMT trials for recurrent CDI have required toxin testing as a criterion for patient selection. The veracity of the CDI diagnosis in subjects recruited to these relatively more robust trials remains uncertain.",

Remarkably, 58% of the screened subjects never had a subsequent recurrence, so they were not randomized. CDI experts have hailed this trial as arguably the most rigorous in the field to examine the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention for acute CDI [34, 35].

In March 2020, the FDA issued another safety alert regarding 2 patients infected with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and 4 others infected with Shiga toxin\u2013producing E. coli (STEC) following FMT provided under Enforcement Discretion [16]. Four patients required hospitalization. All cases were linked to contaminated stool, with a single donor linked to all 4 STEC cases. Another patient died after receiving stool from the STEC-positive donor, although it is unknown if FMT contributed to this person\u2019s death as his/her stool was not tested. Recall of this STEC-positive donor did not occur until a second case was reported [46]. The stool bank employed a relatively low-sensitivity test (ie, toxin immunoassay) rather than a more sensitive molecular assay (ie, PCR), which may have enabled these transmissions [47].",

The HIV epidemic was well underway for approximately a decade before it was clinically recognized and identified. Patients deserve risk mitigation, which can be accomplished with thorough vetting and regulation. Mandatory screening guidelines for stool donors are urgently needed, although screening cannot prevent unanticipated emerging infections. Finally, the development of investigational microbiome therapeutics with defined microbial consortia will offer greater confidence in drug purity, identity, and potency, in addition to risk mitigation for improved patient safety [4, 55].",
