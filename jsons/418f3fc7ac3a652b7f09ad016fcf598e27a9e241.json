The biological \"purpose\" of any replication cycle is the generation of new viral genomes and proteins in sufficient quantities to ensure propagation of the viral genome (a clear example of the \"selfish gene\"); this requires that the extracellular viral genome is protected from enzymatic degradation and can be introduced into further target cells for further rounds of replication. Much has become known about the initial stages of attachment, and more detailed study shows that the initial recognition between virus and host is more complex than originally supposed. Temporal regulation of intracellular events is critical in all but the very simplest of viruses, with some form of suppression of the host innate immune response being common to nearly all human viruses. There are examples where the innate immune response is even used to enhance virus spread to cells otherwise unavailable to the virus. Over the next few years, the boundaries between virus-directed events and cellular processes that control specialized cell functions are likely to be even more complex; nevertheless understanding these processes will open up a range of targets for the development of novel antiviral therapies and immunotherapy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "This chapter presents an overview of the subject, indicating similarities and differences in the replication strategies adopted by viruses of each family that contains human pathogens.

Artificial medium was developed to maintain cell viability independent of the source species: these cells could be in the form of organ cultures, explant cultures, primary cell culture monolayers, or monolayer cell cultures immortalized into cell lines. Organ cultures maintain the three-dimensional structure of the tissue of origin and can be useful for short-term experiments that depend upon preserving fully differentiated cells. For example, tracheal epithelial cells attached to the cartilage matrix of the trachea during culture played a critical role in the isolation of many human respiratory viruses. The preparation of primary cell cultures uses proteases such as trypsin or collagenase to separate individual cells of a tissue such as fetal kidney or lung, and the individual cells then attach to a cell culture substrate where a limited number of divisions will occur.

Each discrete mRNA is released from the template while the enzyme continues to transcribe the next gene in sequence.

Where initiation of translation at an internal AUG takes place, a frameshift can also occur. Another mechanism, known as ribosomal frameshifting, occurs fortuitously when a ribosome happens to slip one nucleotide back and forth along an RNA template.

In fact, this phenomenon was first observed by Preben and Herdis von Magnus in 1944 with influenza virus; they found that very high multiplicities led to poor virus replication and the production of \"interfering\" virus stocks. A cyclical pattern may be observed, where DI particles increase in number as long as the culture has sufficient wild-type helper virus replication; however, as DI particles then inhibit the numbers of wild-type virus, the whole virus population diminishes, fresh rounds of wildtype virus replication can then occur and so a milieu for a return to DI replication is built up again. Despite several suggestions, it is not clear to what extent DI particles play a role in the pathogenesis of an ongoing infection in a host, for example, in modulating recovery from an acute infection or promoting chronic infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DEFECTIVE INTERFERING VIRUSES"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Timing is everything: finetuned molecular machines orchestrate paramyxovirus entry", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Bose", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Jardetsky", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Lamb", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2015, "venue": "Virology", "volume": "479", "issn": "", "pages": "518--530", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Principles of Virology", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Flint", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": ["W"], "last": "Enquist", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "V", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Racaniello", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["F"], "last": "Rall", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A.-M", "middle": [], "last": "Skalka", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2016, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "HIV-1 assembly, release and maturation", "authors": [{"first": "E", "middle": ["O"], "last": "Freed", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2015, "venue": "Nat.
