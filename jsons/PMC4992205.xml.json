It has recently emerged as a major cause of porcine neonatal diarrhoea in America [1]. It has also been reported in association with neonatal diarrhoea in Europe although one study found no clear association between C. difficile isolation and diarrhoea [2, 3]. Porcine Clostridium difficile -associated disease (CDAD) typically manifests itself as early-onset diarrhoea and sudden death in piglets 1\u20137 days of age. Gross lesions may include mesocolonic oedema and large intestines may be filled with pasty to watery yellowish contents. Histopathological mucosal lesions are limited to the caecum and colon. They are typically mild, but vary from grossly inapparent, multifocal necrosis of surface epithelial cells to transmural necrosis. The classic lesions are segmental erosions of the epithelium with effusion of fibrin and neutrophils into the lumen, so-called \u201cvolcano ulcers\u201d [4].",

C. difficile produces two major toxins, Toxin A (TcdA) and Toxin B (TcdB) that act synergistically to cause apoptosis of mucosal epithelial cells and disruption of intracellular actin filaments responsible for cell to cell adhesion. Consequently, there is increased permeability of mucosal surfaces. Toxins A and B also initiate an inflammatory cascade that can result in increased damage to host tissues and fluid exudation [6]. The requirements for development of CDAD are disruption of normal intestinal or colonic flora, presence of the organism in the environment, and the production of toxins [5].",

There are a number of different molecular methods available for strain typing, most commonly polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based ribotyping, multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA), pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) [13, 14]. PCR ribotype 078 is the most commonly reported isolate from pigs in most studies, including a recent Irish study in pigs of different ages [2, 14\u201316]. In one study in humans this strain was shown to have increased by at least 6-fold from 2000 to 2008 [17]. Moreover, genetically indistinguishable C. difficile 078 stains have been found in pigs and farmers, indicating interspecies transmission but the route of transmission has not been determined [18]. Therefore there is increasing interest in C. difficile as a \u2018One Health\u2019 issue. Our findings of two ribotypes in this one herd are consistent with previous reports of diversity of C. difficile ribotypes amongst pigs in an international study of animal associated strains, and a previous report from Germany [19, 20].",

A UK study has shown that only 38 % of CDAD in hospital in-patients can be attributed to transmissions within the hospital [22]. This has led to increased interest in the \u2018One Health\u2019 epidemiology of C. difficile. PCR ribotype results were available for only 16 % of human cases in Ireland in 2014: ribotypes 078 and 014 were most frequently reported, both 11 % of known results [21].",
