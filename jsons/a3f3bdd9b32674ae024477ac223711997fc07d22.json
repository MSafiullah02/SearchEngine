Unless there is a low threshold to pursue investigation, athletes may suffer serious consequences. Injuries to the chest and abdomen are often more subtle in presentation than other injuries, such as an acute ligament rupture. Thoracoabdominal injuries are uncommon, and catastrophic events can occur if an intra-abdominal or intrathoracic injury is unrecognized. Awareness of the organs that can be injured, and how such injuries may present, is the best defense against missing potentially life-threatening thoracic and abdominal trauma [1] .",

Injuries to hollow viscera and the pancreas cause peritonitis, often resulting in severe pain. Initially, this is localized to the site of injury. Peritoneal signs, such as referred tenderness and loss of bowel sounds, are found with progression of intraabdominal injury. Auscultation for bowel sounds can be misleading, as the presence of bowel sounds does not exclude injury. Walking or coughing can also precipitate pain. Retroperitoneal injuries may occur without peritoneal signs when there is minor trauma. Hematuria is often the only clinical manifestation of renal trauma.",

Most commonly, a blow to the lower left chest wall can result in an injury to the spleen [1] . Conversely, several case reports exist in the literature of abdominal impact resulting in an intrathoracic injury, such as a pneumothorax. One such report by Roberts [4] described an ice hockey player who was checked into the boards and sustained an impact over his left lower ribs. Initial concern for a splenic injury proved unfounded, and he was allowed to return to the game. However, he was too uncomfortable to continue, and assessment afterward revealed a 15% pneumothorax on chest x-ray. Hence, pulmonary injury from abdominal trauma can occur without disruption of the diaphragm. Diaphragm rupture is uncommon but is usually left sided (70-90%), as the liver appears to protect the right side.",

While ultrasonography is not as sensitive for intra-abdominal trauma, does not provide as much anatomic detail, does not allow for injury grading [14] , and remains operator dependent, it does have a role, for instance, in the hemodynamically unstable patient [15, 16] . Hoffman et al. described a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 99% in detecting intra-abdominal injuries [16] , while Berkoff suggests sensitivity of 60% (95% CI 49-70) [17] . Ultrasound visualizes free intraperitoneal fluid well, though it may not identify the injured organ [18] . Conditions identified on ultrasound in unstable patients will eventually require CT to identify the injury and to guide management [18] . The use of abdominal ultrasound for evaluation of unstable patients has been described by the term \"focused assessment with sonography for trauma\" (FAST) [19] . The FAST examination aims to recognize peritoneal fluid/blood, which typically arises from a solid organ injury. A hypotensive athlete who has suffered abdominal trauma with a positive finding on a FAST examination has a higher likelihood of operative management [17, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

If no mass effect is caused by this air, the injury is referred to as a simple pneumothorax. However, if the loss of air into the pleural space continues, tension can result with concomitant shift of the mediastinum away from the side of the pneumothorax. Such a tension pneumothorax requires immediate decompression with a needle into the chest cavity and, optimally, by a tube thoracostomy. If this is not done, the continued pressure and mediastinal shift will lead to respiratory compromise by inhibition of airflow into the working lung and to cardiac compromise by a reduction in venous return to the heart. Pneumothorax, whether simple or tension, can occur spontaneously from rupture of a bleb, from a sudden compressive force to the chest with a resulting rupture of the lung parenchyma, or from a displaced rib fracture that penetrates the lung. Both simple and tension pneumothoraces are associated with tachypnea, dyspnea, and sudden chest pain, though these findings may be quite subtle with a simple pneumothorax. Of those with spontaneous pneumothorax, up to 87% will present with chest pain and 43% with shortness of breath [39] .",

The athlete can resume normal activity within a few days of discharge or as other injuries allow. Occasionally, a small, simple pneumothorax of 20% or less can be treated without tube thoracostomy if the patient is asymptomatic and has no other injuries. This approach requires careful observation and repeat chest x-ray to document stability. Regardless of treatment type, recurrence rates of primary spontaneous pneumothorax are reportedly high in children, up to 54% [44] . Return to physical activity should be delayed until complete resolution of the pneumothorax [45] . Symptoms of primary spontaneous pneumothorax often resolve within 24 h, even prior to resolution of the pneumothorax [46] . Therefore, return to play should be determined on a case-by-case basis. Current guidelines recommend avoidance of air travel within 2-3 weeks following a pneumothorax, due to concern that a volume of air trapped in the pleural cavity may expand and develop into a tension pneumothorax in the lower cabin pressure of a commercial airplane in flight [47] .",

It is often of apparently low energy and results in cardiac arrhythmias in the absence of any structural injury to the heart or surrounding tissues [52] . The epidemiology of commotio cordis has been studied in the United States over the last several decades with the use of a commotio cordis injury registry, first described by Maron et al. in 1995 [52-55] . Most cases occur in teenage males, with a mean age of 15 years, and it has been speculated that the more compliant chest cage of younger athletes may make them more susceptible to these impacts. Over half of reported commotio cordis events occur during organized competitive sports, with the remainder occurring during practice or daily activities. The majority of blows resulting in commotio cordis are the result of a small projectile impacting the chest, such as a baseball, lacrosse ball, or hockey puck, while the rest are from bodily contact [56] .",

Fractures of the upper zone or lower zone ribs, multiple fractures, and flail segments are less likely to be isolated injuries than other patterns of rib fractures and may result in injury to surrounding structures [76, 80] . Acute traumatic impact fractures of the first and second rib are often associated with neck trauma and vascular injuries, as well as pneumothorax, lung laceration, and hemothorax. Direct impact fractures of the lower ribs may injure the kidneys, liver, or spleen.

Patients with significant chest trauma should be referred to the emergency department for evaluation with a CT scan, which can also assess for associated intrathoracic and intraabdominal injuries.

Taping is controversial and may lead to increased splinting, pulmonary complications, and atelectasis. Activities should be modified until symptoms resolve, and training should be resumed gradually. Return to play should only be considered in patients whose symptoms resolve and who have minimal pain with palpation.",

This diagnosis has remained somewhat elusive, in part due to variation in definitions within the literature. Scott and Scott described the more inclusive \"painful rib syndrome\" as the clinical presentation of pain in the lower chest or abdomen, a tender spot on the lower costal margin, and reproduction of pain by pressing that spot [118] . Slipping rib syndrome may also mimic abdominal pathology, due to its common presentation with upper abdominal pain [119] . The condition typically involves the eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs. These ribs are attached to each other by fibrous tissue in adults and by cartilaginous tissue in children. It is believed that when these connections are weakened or ruptured by trauma, the ribs can slip and impinge on the intercostal nerve, producing pain [120] . Rib-tip syndrome is usually unilateral; however, it may be bilateral [118, 121] . This condition particularly affects running, vigorous arm exercise, arm abduction, and swimming [101] . It has been reported more frequently in adults but nevertheless is a cause of rib and upper abdominal pain in adolescent and collegiate athletes [122] [123] [124] .",

A positive test reproduces the patient's pain and results in a click. Direct tenderness over the cartilage is another frequent finding. The diagnosis is clinical, and diagnostic imaging is generally not helpful, although it may exclude other conditions. Intercostal nerve blocks may be useful in establishing the diagnosis.

Any of these mechanisms are possible in high-speed or contact sports. The mechanism of splenic injury was explored in a study of downhill skiers [173] . In highvelocity or high-impact collisions, e.g., with a tree, a chairlift pole, or a snow fence, multiple trauma was always present (fractures or damage to multiple organs). Skiers were unable to move at the scene, and splenectomy resulted in five out of six cases (83%). With low-velocity or low-impact collisions, often just a single organ was involved. Such injuries resulted from falls on ski trails, on moguls, or on tree stumps or rocks. Presentation in these cases was often delayed for hours, while the individual continued skiing. Splenectomy was necessary in 5 of 12 cases (42%).",

Nonoperative management of splenic injuries consists of careful hemodynamic monitoring, frequent physical and laboratory examination, and, most importantly, strict bed rest. Given a stable course, a CT scan should be repeated after 5-7 days and should show stabilization or improvement of the injury. Rest and avoidance of contact sports are recommended for up to 4 months after injury. This is determined largely by the severity of the injury seen on CT and its resolution.

Sportsman's hernias are particularly common in sports such as soccer and hockey, where athletes frequently change direction at high speed [195] [196] [197] . The sportsman's hernia is resistant to conservative therapy, and symptoms will recur after a period of rest. The key physical exam finding is tenderness at the pubic tubercle. This injury does not typically show up on routine imaging. Surgical repair of the inguinal floor will return approximately 90% of patients to full activity without pain [194] .",
