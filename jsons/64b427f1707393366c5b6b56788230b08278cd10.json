Secondly, because of the usual hospital-centric management, they are often called to go to the hospital for treatment, diagnostic investigations and for follow-up. Thirdly, when they contract Covid-19 disease their clinical course is more likely to be severe.",

Consequently, specific guidelines have been issued by various scientific societies such as ASCO, ESMO, NCCN, AIOM, etc. The opportunity to keep cancer patients for whom there are no priority clinical needs away from hospitals is unanimously recognized. Outpatient visits are usually rescheduled or shifted to telemedicine. Triage of patients and health workers is critical to reduce exposure to other patients and staff with the aim of keep-ing the hospital virus free. The policy \"stay at home when ill\" together with a strategy that tests staff, tracking results for persons under investigation, tracing exposures, and defining return to work is fundamental to limit shortage in terms of workforce.",
