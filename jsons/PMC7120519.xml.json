            "text": "Despite extraordinary advances in diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccine development, emerging and reemerging viral diseases have occurred during the past several decades [1, 2]. Several factors that contributed to the emergence of recent epidemics have been identified including those related to the microbial agent, the human host, and the human environment. Also among the most important factors are genetic adaptations of the microbial agent, international travel, human susceptibility to infection, population growth, an aging population, climate and weather changes, and expanding vector habitats [2\u20135]. Three recent examples of disease emergence are the Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Chikungunya, and the Zika viruses, which represent new viral entities or viruses emergent in new geographic locales and characterized by novel complications [6, 7]. However, the most important newest example of an emergent infectious disease is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which emerged a century ago in a primate host(s), and subsequently spread within the human population. HIV-related acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the most dreadful complication, was first recognized in 1981 in men who have sex with men, injection drug users, and recipients of blood transfusions [8\u201310]. Subsequently, in the year 1983, Francois Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi, Luc Montagnier, and others from the Institute Pasteur in Paris identified the etiologic agent of this disease and called it the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Both French virologists were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2008 for this discovery. At present, however, HIV infection has become a global disease affecting heterosexual individuals, especially within the developing world [11].",

After binding to the CD4+ receptor the virus uses the machinery of the CD4+ T cell, to replicate and spread throughout the body. The process of replication is carried out in several stages: binding, fusion, reverse transcription, integration, replication, assembly, and budding.",

Immune activation is the major force that drives the HIV process and is associated with viremia and has a negative correlation with the CD4+ T cell count during chronic infection [13]. Cellular and soluble factors play an important role in acute and chronic immune activation and progression to AIDS [12\u201314] (Table 15.2 and Fig. 15.2).",

HIV patients may exhibit symmetrical polyarthritis, which tends to be seronegative for the most part. However, erosive forms and seropositive for rheumatoid factor (RF) have also been described [60]. On the other hand, the presence of low titer RF and CCP antibodies in patients with HIV may lead to an erroneous diagnosis of RA. HIV patients may also exhibit a high proportion of RF and CCP antibodies, which decrease after initiation of cART suggesting that HIV is capable of inducing autoantibodies. Follow-up studies, however, of this HIV population does not reveal the development of RA [61\u201364]. In addition, it is well recognized the presence of false-positive HIV serology in patients with RA suggesting a cross-reactivity between HIV diagnostic tests in patients with RA [65]. Another important issue was the impact of de novo HIV infection in established RA [66, 67]. An early observation in the pandemic was that most RA patients might go into remission after the development of AIDS. However, the presence of active RA disease including radiological progression can be seen despite a profound state of immunosuppression [68, 69]. Also, development of de novo RF and CCP antibodies positive RA can be seen in well control HIV infection (normal CD4 cell count and negative HIV viral load), and RA disease activity behaves in identical fashion as in RA seen in HIV negative individuals.",

A variety of constitutional manifestations such as fever, arthralgia, arthritis, myalgia, skin rash, lymph node enlargement, cytopenias, pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, and CNS involvement can be observed in both active SLE and HIV infection. A variety of autoantibodies including ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, and anti-cardiolipin antibodies can be seen in both disorders. But hypocomplementemia secondary to HIV has not been described, and this finding may be used to distinguish lupus activity from HIV infection [70, 71]. Diagnostic tests for HIV have been reported as false-positive results in SLE patients and multiple studies have reported autoantibodies reactivity to HIV p18 and p24 antigens. These findings make necessary the need to perform confirmatory tests, such as viral RNA PCR or HIV-Western Blot assays [72].",

Two large studies, one from Taiwan and the second from France, merit discussion [90, 109]. In the first study, Yen et al. reported on the incidence of AIDS in a nationwide HIV/AIDS patient (PLWHA) cohort in Taiwan and compared it with the general population; standardized incidence rates (SIRs) were higher for incident Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, psoriasis, SLE, autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA), and uveitis. An interesting observation was the lower risk for development of AS despite a high prevalence of HLA-B27 in Taiwanese people (5%). In contrast, PLWHA who received cART had higher SIRs for psoriasis, AHA, and uveitis, while those that did not receive cART had higher SIRs for Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, psoriasis, RA, SLE, and other autoimmune disorders . Lebrun et al. also conducted an epidemiologic study in a French nation-wide HIV cohort to estimate the prevalence of 26 inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (IADs) among patients living with HIV (PLHIV) in the cART era (from January 2000 to July 2013), and to describe their occurrence according to cART onset, the immune-virological status and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and/or hepatitis B virus coinfection. Results showed that several IADs including psoriasis, sarcoidosis, RA, AS, Grave\u2019s disease, AHA, immune thrombocytopenia, and chronic inflammatory bowel disease were the most prevalent diseases. Majority of patients (59%) developed IAD after HIV infection with a mean delay of 10.6 + \u22126.4 years. In addition, patients developing IAD after the diagnosis of HIV infection, 572 (70%) were on cART and 419 of them (73%) had undetectable HIV viral load. Comparing data from Taiwan and French studies, some geographical variability in terms of IADs is observed, but both studies confirmed previous reports in the literature concerning the relationship between HIV/AIDS and rheumatic disorders.",

A significant proportion of HIV-associated AIDs including inflammatory musculoskeletal involvement respond well to conventional therapy such as NSAIDs, narcotic drugs and DMARDs, but refractory cases may need the use of biological agents, especially TNF inhibitors [133]. The use of these agents may represent a challenge, especially in patients with co-existent hepatitis infection, but published reports indicate that in the presence of stable CD4+ T cell counts and low viral loads their use can be both safe and efficacious. When considering immune suppressive therapy, it is important to keep in mind that CD4+ T cells are necessary in the control of intracellular and extracellular bacteria, parasites, and viruses, and the presence of TNF is needed and useful for controlling infection, and its increase favors replication of viral particles.",

In general, AIDs appear following diagnosis of HIV infection and also under cART, and clinical manifestations observed in the HIV population are similar to those seen in the general population. Glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive agents seem to be effective and well-tolerated, but prophylaxis of infection is very important. Comorbidities such as osteoporosis and AVN appear as a consequence of the aging of the HIV-infected population and appropriate preventive measures should be taken. While the pathophysiology of HIV-related autoimmune rheumatic diseases is not well understood, the intricate enigma of this association merits further investigation.",
