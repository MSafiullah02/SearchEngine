The authors excluded specific forms from the study, such as SJS, TEN, fixed drug eruption (FDE), AGEP, phototoxicity, and vasculitis. This suggests that in cases of drug-induced reactions with extensive cutaneous affection, with or without lymphadenopathy, a laboratory investigation is required with a complete hemogram and hepatic function test.",

Vasovagal reactions are most often confused with anaphylaxis [8]. In general they are consequences of procedures such as injections, which present as a clinical condition consisting of facial paleness, nausea, profuse sweating, and syncope, with symptoms improving without treatment 20 to 30 min later [8]. Absence of pruritus in the presence of a slow pulse and normal blood pressure distinguish vasovagal reactions from anaphylaxis [8].",

Onset begins with enanthema and edema, which give rise to erosions and pseudomembranous formations on the eyes, mouth, genitals, pharynx, and upper airways [19].

Mucous membrane was affected in 91.7% of these patients. The patients received intravenous infusion of gammaglobulins begun on average 7 days after onset of TEN (with a variation of 2\u201330 days). It was administered over a period of 1\u20135 days, in doses varying from 0.65 to 5.8 g/kg (mean total dose of 2.7 g/kg). An objective positive response to treatment occurred with a break in the progression of TEN, observed in 43 (90%) of the 48 patients. In all there were six deaths. The authors concluded that early use of intravenous gammaglobulin is safe, with a recommended dose of 1 g/kg daily for 3 days in a row. In contrast to the studies of Prins et al. [34], a French group (Bachot, Revuz, and Roujeau) led a noncomparative prospective study of 34 patients diagnosed with SJS (nine patients), SJS/TEN overlapping (five patients), and TEN (20 patients). They concluded that intravenous gammaglobulin in a 2-g/kg daily dose, administered for 2 days in a row, did not reduce patient mortality [35].",

There are two possibilities:(i)DRESS/DIHS began as an \u201callergic\u201d immune reaction to a particular drug, which seems to possess an innate ability to stimulate T cells. In the context of T-cell activation is a massive activation of herpesvirus housed in these cells, since the stimulation of T cells by the drug may reactivate the viral genome into the cell. Thus, the drug in turn can activate a specific cellular and humoral immune response to herpesvirus. This could explain why different herpesviruses are activated and because in another intense immune process, so-called GVHD, a similar reactivation can be observed.(ii)The viral reactivation can occur but is initially clinically unapparent. However, T cells stimulated by virus present significant cross-reactivity with certain drugs, and exposure to these drugs leads to an expansion of T cells specific to the drug (and viruses), which persists even after drug withdrawal due to persistence of viral antigens. The simultaneous appearance of multiple concurrent viral reactivation could be explained by the ability of HHV-6 and HHV-7 counterparts to reactivate virus. Thus, if the symptoms of DRESS/DIHS are mediated by both the various gene products and herpesvirus immune responses to viral replication, the frequent deterioration or the several exacerbations that occur despite withdrawal of the offending drug could derive, at least in part, from the sequential activation of this herpesvirus.\n",

Sugita et al. demonstrated a reduction in the number of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in peripheral blood of patients, but an increase in the expression of these cells in skin affected by the rash. The pDC human leukocyte subtypes are capable of producing large amounts of interferon-\u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1), which induces the maturation of B cells in order to produce IgG and plays a critical role in antiviral defense. The pDC from circulation may accumulate in the skin and thus reduce the number of pDC in the circulation. Therefore, antiviral responses may be reduced, facilitating viral reactivation in peripheral blood and tissues other than the skin.",

The authors suggested that the administration of systemic corticosteroid for the treatment of DRESS/DIHS may have contributed to the increased risk of herpes zoster. Indeed, herpes zoster was not detected in patients with DIHS/DRESS who were treated with only supportive care. Presumably, the altered underlying immunologic pathomechanism of DIHS/DRESS caused by the systemic corticosteroid might have played an important role in the onset of herpes zoster. It has been shown that DIHS/DRESS is a manifestation of newly observed immune reconstitution syndrome (IRS), and herpes zoster is observed as the most common manifestation of IRS after highly active antiretroviral therapy for AIDS. Relevant clues related to DRESS syndrome include:DRESS/DIHS is an ADR caused by an apparent group of drugs, and one-third of cases are related to anticonvulsants, in addition to sulfonamides and allopurinol, which can cause 10\u201320% mortality.The syndrome is characterized by a latency period ranging between 3 weeks and 3 months after the introduction of the offending drug, and its course is marked by apparent sequential reactivation of HHV and subsequent development of autoimmune diseases, providing an opportunity to establish a connection between viral infections and the emergence of autoimmune diseases.In early DRESS/DIHS hypogammaglobulinemia and reduced peripheral B cells are found, and CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ (regulatory T cells) levels are high at the beginning of the syndrome, regardless of whether or not patients are treated with corticosteroids. This clonal expansion of regulatory T cells appears to prevent activation of antiviral T cells in an appropriate manner and sequential reactivation of virus is presented in the syndrome. These regulatory T cells have the phenotype CCR4+ and CLA+, which address the skin. In the last stage of the syndrome\u2019s activity, phenotype of cytotoxic T cells becomes prominent and CD4+ lymphocytes are intensely diminished. These cells are depleted over time, suffering apoptosis and becoming reduced after the resolution of the syndrome, which could be a predisposing factor for the development of autoimmunity.\n",

A change in the infusion rate or the absence of venous return in the aspirate may indicate the occurrence of extravasation. After 2\u20133 days, erythema increases and there is pain, a brownish discoloration, induration, dry desquamation, or the appearance of blisters. If the amount extravasated was small, the signs and symptoms may disappear in the following weeks. If a significant amount was extravasated, the following symptoms may appear in the coming weeks: necrosis, formation of eschar and painful, necrotic ulceration with raised, erythematous borders and a yellowish base. There is generally no granulation tissue with these ulcerations. They may resolve slowly or persist, increasing gradually in area. Involvement of the tendons, nerves, and vessels may occur if appropriate treatment is not given, leading to severe sequelae such as nerve compression syndrome, a reduction in joint mobility, contractures, neural deficits, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy.

(1a) These arene oxides are detoxified by glutathione transferase and epoxide hydrolase in nontoxic metabolites. (2) In genetically predisposed individuals or by additional factors, an impaired detoxification and accumulation of these metabolites occur (3), which can cause cellular damage generating danger signs that can stimulate resting T cells, inducing costimulatory pathways (4). In addition, ethnic predisposition to certain HLA types may contribute to the formation of neoantigens from the combination of these intermediary reactive metabolites with tissue macromolecules and formation of haptens (5a), which can be presented via the human histocompatibility complex class I (HLA-DR) or class II (HLA-A, -B or -C), to CD4 or CD8 T cells (6). It was demonstrated that carbamazepine, valproic acid, and amoxicillin are able to exert immunomodulatory actions by inhibiting histone decarboxylase on B lymphocytes, producing a hypogammaglobulinemia that precedes the clinical onset of DRESS/DIHS. The clonal expansion of T cells requires sequential reactivation of latent herpesvirus, and at the same time CD8+ CLA+ T cells are produced, which are directed toward skin, CD8+ CCR4+ T cells addressed to the lungs (7b), and CD4+ IL-4, IL-5 producer and IL-17 CD4 Th17+ producer that cause tissue and peripheral eosinophilia",
