[2] [3] [4] Other risk factors include cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and probably male sex. [2] [3] [4] Until today, no data are available regarding the risk for severe disease in patients with auto-immune/auto-inflammatory rheumatic diseases who are receiving or not immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents. [2] [3] [4] There has been only one report of 18 patients with history of cancer from China, which showed that their risk for developing critical disease or death was higher (39% vs. 8%) compared to the rest of the infected population (n=1.572). 5 However, it should be noted that these patients with history of neoplasia were older (63 vs. 49 years old) and more frequently smokers (22% vs. 7%). 5 It is unknown whether the lack of data for rheumatic patients is due to the low frequency of autoimmune inflammatory diseases in the general population (~2-2.5%), especially those treated with high-potency immunosuppressives, to inadequate recording, or to an actual absence of increased risk. However, the lack of published data for these patients does not exclude the possibility that they are at higher risk for a severe outcome. Based on the above limited data, our National Society, taking into account the critical situation with the COVID19 infection worldwide and the potential risk for severe disease in our patients: ",
