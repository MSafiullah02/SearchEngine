Although challenging without strict containment measures, identification of these subjects may slow the spread of SARS-CoV2. The cases of Veneto and Lombardia, contemporaneously affected neighboring regions in Italy, provide 2 telling examples with strikingly different endings. As of April 15, 2020, a total of 44,107 tests per million people have been performed in Veneto, which is double the number of tests conducted in Lombardia (Fig. 1). Indeed, in contrast to the neighboring region, Veneto adopted a large-scale population screening model at the beginning of the outbreak, allowing home isolation for a larger number of mild (or asymptomatic) cases (85% vs 60% of active cases according to the last estimates).4 This strategy may have avoided overwhelming the health system, with a consequent positive impact on the case fatality rate in Veneto, which is currently almost 3 times lower than that in Lombardia.",
