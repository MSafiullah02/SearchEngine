Influenza epidemics are events that occur yearly (or every few years) and are caused by a phenomenon known as antigenic drift. Antigenic drift refers to a minor change that occurs within the influenza virus (at the hemagglutinin or neuraminidase site).3 The resultant strain of influenza is different enough that a new vaccine must be developed to prevent people from getting sick. However, it is not so different that mortality or morbidity rates within a population change very much. Each year in the United States, approximately 36,000 people die from influenza-related illness. Mortality, very predictably, occurs among the very old and very young.4 In general, epidemic influenza strains are characterized early enough to develop adequate vaccine stocks to protect the population during the flu season.5 World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating influenza centers around the world detect new variants, and each year 2 influenza type-A strains and one influenza type-B strain are chosen for a trivalent vaccine.5\n",

Production of vaccine takes 6 to 9 months, and in that time, the virus will have spread across the globe.6 Mass vaccination of the population will be required for a pandemic as opposed to the targeted vaccination required to control an epidemic.7\n",

First, it is unlikely that enough (or any) vaccine will be available quickly enough to prevent significant morbidity and mortality. Second, the population at high risk for complications may expand tremendously. Finally, it is unlikely that an influenza pandemic will be contained among health care workers even if excellent infection control practices are followed.

This scenario occurred dramatically in the 1976 swine flu outbreak.26 In January 1976, an outbreak of influenza at Fort Dix, New Jersey, left 1 soldier dead, 4 ill, and 500 exposed. The influenza virus in the dead soldier was identified as H1N1, an antigenic shift from the H3N2 virus that had been circulating worldwide at that time. After confirming that person-to-person spread was probably occurring and surmising that a pandemic was imminent, a panel of experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), The Food and Drug Administration, and The National Institutes of Health recommended mass vaccination.26 Between October 1 and December 16, 1976, 45 million people in the United States were vaccinated against swine flu. As it turned out, a pandemic did not occur, and 532 people who received the influenza vaccine developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, a neurologic disease that causes paralysis.26 In retrospect, the fact that no other cases of swine flu occurred after the 5 cases at Fort Dix and the absence of cases in the southern hemisphere, where epidemics usually start, should have halted the vaccination campaign before it started.",

It seems feasible that such monitoring would identify most of the ill workers and, thus, allow timely administration of antiviral therapy. We estimate that, with excellent infection control practices, we could expect 10% to 15% of our hospital workers to become ill during an influenza pandemic. Thus, at our hospital, we would expect to treat approximately 1000 to 1500 people with a 5-day course of oseltamivir (10 pills).

Created in response to the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici Domestic Preparedness Program by the Department of Defense, MEMS is an attempt to expand the local health care structure in response to a mass casualty event (www.edgewood.army.mil/downloads/reports/mems_copper_book.pdf). To manage the huge patient burden of a mass casualty event like pandemic influenza, health care delivery will be moved away from hospitals except for the most seriously ill patients. Two patient care modules would be established within communities: The Neighborhood Emergency Help Center (NEHC) would be the primary triage point for symptomatic and asymptomatic exposed patients. From the NEHC, patients could be sent home, to a hospital, or to an Acute Care Center (ACC). ACCs would accommodate patients who require hospitalization but do not need ventilator support or ICU care. The ACC will be near a hospital and will be staffed by physicians and nurses who can provide intravenous fluids, intravenous and oral medications, oxygen, and other supportive care. Also, patients for whom survival is unlikely may be sent to an ACC for comfort care. Area hospitals will only take the sickest patients and all elective procedures will likely cease until the end of the outbreak. NEHCs and ACCs also might serve as distribution/administration points for antiviral medications and/or vaccine in the case of pandemic influenza. Although MEMS is not yet fully functional, states are beginning to implement plans for its creation, and exercises have been organized to test it. It is not yet clear what the trigger will be for activating MEMS, but it is likely to be different in each state/locality.",

Both the CDC and the Health Resources and Services Administration have provided funds for training, communication, public health preparedness and hospital preparedness (www.hhs.gov/news/press/2003pres/20030320.html). In 2003, Michigan received close to $41.5 million for bioterrorism preparedness. This money has been used to develop a regional structure that brings together public health, emergency management, law enforcement, and the hospitals in preparing for a biological event (www.2south.com/index.php).",
