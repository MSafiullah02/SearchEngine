The limitations of PNA for such applications include poor membrane permeability, low aqueous solubility, and ambiguity in DNA binding orientation. The strategy behind these modifications includes:1.Introduction of chirality into the achiral PNA backbone.2.Rigidify PNA backbone via conformational constraint to pre-organize the PNA structure and entropically drive the duplex formation.3.Introduction of cationic functional groups to improve water solubility.4.Modulate nucleobase pairing either by modification of the linker or the nucleobase itself for effective binding at physiological conditions.\n",

For instance, the presence of amide group provides rigidity to the structure which was replaced with an amine group, resulting into the reduction of binding affinity which further confirmed the significance of \u2018constrained flexibility\u2019 of PNA backbone. In order to increase rigidity, a cyclic group such as cyclohexyl (Sharma et al., 2010) was incorporated but it resulted in decreased binding affinity. On the contrary, introduction of cyclopentyl (Pokorski et al., 2004), (2S,5R)-aminoethyl pipecolyl (Shirude et al., 2004), prolyl (Corradini et al., 2007) derivatives were found to improve binding affinity. Furthermore, charged PNAs have been developed to enhance the solubility and cellular delivery by introducing groups like phosphates (Shiraishi et al., 2008) and guanidium (Katritzky and Narindoshvili, 2008) in the backbone.",

            "text": "Along with backbone modifications, PNA can also be synthesized using non-natural nucleobases which could aid in achieving higher duplex/triplex stabilities and could generate new recognition motifs with potential applications in research and diagnostics. For example, 2,6-diaminopurine offers increased affinity and selectivity for thymine and pseudoisocytosine mimics the C+ recognition pattern for triplex formation (Haaima et al., 1997). 2-Aminopurine can comprise hydrogen bond in the reverse Watson-Crick mode with thymine and uracil and being inherently fluorescent it can further be used to study the kinetics of the hybridization process with complementary nucleic acids (Gangamani and Kumar, 1997). Introduction of fluorescent thiazole orange as nucleobase into PNA afforded a PNA probe that detected hybridization through enhanced fluorescence (K\u00f6hler and Seitz, 2003, Jarikote et al., 2005). Hypoxanthine (Sanders et al., 2013), N4-benzoylcytosine (Olsen et al., 2011) and 6-thioguanine (Henrik et al., 1999) represent some more examples of modified nucleobases. Thiouracil along with 2,6-diaminopurine has also been utilized as a base pair in recognizing PNA/DNA which finally led a phenomenon termed as \u2018double duplex invasion\u2019. Moreover, introduction of a tricyclic G-clamp (Rajeev et al., 2002, Ortega et al., 2007) modified nucleobase, via both base pairing and base stacking enhanced the duplex stability while increasing the solubility because of the presence of positively charged side chains. Recently, Rozners and coworkers (Li et al., 2010, Rozners, 2012) reported that P and E nucleobases modified PNA monomers were able to isolate pyrimidine interruptions in polypurine tracts of double helical RNA. Another hydrolytically labile nucleobase 5-(acridin-9-ylamino) uracil was prepared by Matarazzoo et al. (Matarazzo et al., 2013) which on hydrolysis produced highly fluorescent acridone and 5-aminouracil. Other modified nucleobases reported are thio-pseudo isocytosine (Devi et al., 2014) for targeting RNA duplex region; 2-amino pyridine (Annoni et al., 2016) as a tool for detecting RNA editing and mono-m-(guanidinoethoxy)phenyl] pyrrolocytosine (Wojciechowski and Hudson, 2009) with enhanced and selective affinity for RNA (Table 2\n).",

These bacterial pathogens exhibit resistance towards conventional antibiotics due to excessive use of these antibiotics and resistance genes transfer within the bacteria. We desperately require new antibacterial drugs for the treatment of patients infected with drug resistant bacteria. Antisense PNAs as antibacterial agents were found to treat infections caused by multidrug resistant bacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most common and clinically important pathogens due to its resistance to an extensive variety of antibiotics. PNA antisense conjugated to the carrier peptide (RXR)4 can be a therapeutic platform capable of targeting a variety of genes in P. aeruginosa (Maekawa et al., 2015). Acinetobacter baumannii causes common and severe community and hospital acquired infections. Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2014) established antisense PNAs to carry out gene specific inhibition effects in multiresistant drug against A. baumannii. The described PNAs conjugated to the (KFF)3K peptide targeted the growth of essential gene gyrA in A. baumannii and showed strong inhibition effects with lowest inhibitory and bactericidal concentration of 5 and 10 \u03bcM, respectively.",

            "text": "Recent studies also revealed the potential of duplex DNA-invading \u03b3PNAs for the identification of both bacterial and fungal pathogens directly from blood without any need for culturing which is time consuming. This approach would help in improving patient\u2019s health by fast and appropriate antimicrobial intervention (N\u00f6lling et al., 2016). Gorska et al. (G\u00f3rska et al., 2016) scanned various target sites in 16S RNA that could be bound with PNA oligomers and one of the tested site verified the bacterial growth inhibition by a PNA oligomer. PNA as antisense molecules when conjugated to a cell penetrating peptide (CPP, i.e. octa-d-lysine) is used as a potential tool for Plasmodium falciparum gene silencing and in the development of potential and highly specific antimalarial agents (Kolevzon et al., 2014). Antisense peptide nucleic acids (APNAs) could also be effectively used to restore vulnerability to \u03b2-lactams in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (Goh et al., 2015). It was also shown that APNA conjugated with antimicrobial peptides could effectively target acpP gene (responsible for growth of fatty acid chain in the biosynthesis of fatty acid) in E. coli with MIC values of 2\u20134 \u03bcM (Hansen et al., 2016). The ability of APNAs conjugated to the (KFF)\u200b3K CPP in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was explored to target possible essential genes (ligA, rpoA, rpoD, engA, tsf, and kdtA). It was concluded that the anti-\u200brpoA and \u2212\u200brpoD PNAs showed highest strength and can be used as antisense agent for down regulating biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa PAO1 as well as inhibit the inflammatory response. It provides great opportunity for the development of new tool for microbial genetic treatment (Soofi and Seleem, 2012, Hu et al., 2011, Montagner et al., 2017).",

A radiolabeled 177Lu DOTA-\u200banti-\u200bbcl-\u200b2-\u200bTyr3-\u200boctreotate PNA\u200b-\u200bpeptide conjugate was designed which resulted in 51% decline in expression of bcl-2 protein in lymphocytic lymphoma cell line Mec-1 cells through antisense activity along with radiologic effects (Balkin et al., 2014). Another designed APNA as per sequence of MUC1 gene was transfected by liposome into human gastric cancer cells (MKN-\u200b45) and the down regulation of MUC1 gene expression successfully inhibited the invasion of tumor cell (Tao et al., 2012). Survivin mRNA APNA (Zhao et al., 2011a, Zhao et al., 2011b) and c-\u200bmyc mRNA APNA (Zhang et al., 2008, Zhao et al., 2008) labeled with 99Tcm could be effectively used as prospective tumor imaging agents.

This inhibition of the gene was done on the mRNA translation and protein expression level (Huang et al., 2010). Moreover, APNA was also found to block mitochondrial DNA transcript promoter of lung cancer SPC-\u200bA1 and changes its physiological characteristics (Wang et al., 2009a).

A high sensitivity and specificity (above 99.0%) with good detection limit, stable reproducibility, no cross reactivity and a long shelf-life (more than eight months) suggested the potential application of PNA based multiplex real-time PCR kits and aid the control of carbapenemase genes.

They utilized the complementary PNA probe which did not obstruct the amplification of MSRV. The balancing PNA probe used in this assay selectively blocked the increase of ERVWE1 (another member of HERV-W family), resulting in the specific detection of MSRV.

These biosensors are quite functional in perceiving targeted genes which are responsible for particular disease. Fig. 3\nshows PNA-DNA hybridization used for detection of DNA sequence. The biosensor functionalized with PNA probes based on a double tilted fiber Bragg grating (DTFBG) was used for the detection of direct label-free DNA with good sensitivity for a solution having concentration as low as 10 nM. Moreover, the sensor could discriminate single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the DNA strand if mismatched DNA strands were used. This strategy of electrochemical biosensor based on PNA probe can also be applied to other target analytes like proteins or contaminants (Candiani et al., 2012). It was also useful in the detection of target DNA sequence and single nucleotide mutation in p53 tumor suppressor gene (Raoof et al., 2011).",

In this biosensor, PNA was immobilized on silicon nitride gate insulator via reaction between thiol group of cysteine in PNA and succinimide group of N-(6-maleimidocaproyloxy)succinimide. It showed a good correlation between Kd and Tm of PNA-DNA duplexes.

In this protocol of glycan immobilization, the homogeneous distribution of ligands was obtained within a microarray spot. This further offered the use of microarrays in higher degree than the available standard contact printing method. In another article, the good compatibility along with standard solid phase synthesis capability of PNA encoded chemical libraries was utilized to synthesize libraries of peptides, heterocycles and glycoconjugates and further diverse screening formats were used to yield specific ligands (Zambaldo et al., 2015). Furthermore, PNA encoded synthesis of a 10,000-member hetero-glycoconjugate library was also reported and an extremely miniaturized synthetic format was used to analyze microarray of diverse lectins (Novoa et al., 2014). Recently, Decurtins and group (Decurtins et al., 2016) have utilized DNA encoded chemical libraries in automated screening for small organic ligands.",

Thus, PNA can act as artificial transcription promoters describing PNA as a specific gene activating reagents and its use in drugs (M\u00f8llegaard et al., 1994). Shimada and group (Shimada et al., 2013) prepared a PNA conjugate having bipyridine unit into the loop moiety of PNAs. This conjugate was specifically designed to structure a PNA/DNA bimolecular triplex and a hairpin. It was observed that on addition of Cu2+, the thermal stability of hairpin structure was hardly affected whereas the stability of PNA/DNA bimolecular triplex structure was drastically destabilized. This was due to its complexation with Cu2+ that changed the conformation of bipyridine unit and decreased the Tm value by 17.4 \u00b0C resulting into 1000-fold decrease in the binding constant. Hence, the formed loop moiety could further be utilized as an allosteric DNA carrier which released DNA in the presence of certain concentration of metal ion. Kundu and group (Kundu et al., 2012) developed a simple method to study the dynamic properties of modified nucleotides. They determined the binding constant between PNA and a hairpin-\u200bstructured DNA through an affinity capillary electrophoresis method. In another report, small cyclic PNAs (Upert et al., 2012) and guanidine based PNAs (Gupta et al., 2012) were found to inhibit viral replication while targeting human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) transactivation responsive element (TAR)\u200bRNA loop. These modified short PNA sequences were found to be highly specific, stable in biological media and possessed enhanced cellular delivery which proved them to be potential anti-HIV agents. These cyclic PNAs were also observed to target HIV-\u200b1 TAR RNA loop through strong interactions with their TAR RNA target. This was found to be even more specific than APNA (Upert et al., 2007).",
