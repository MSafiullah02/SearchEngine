            "text": "Since the pioneering works of Sir Ronald Ross, Kermack and McKendrick (see, for instance, [15], [16], [23]), numerous mathematical models have been designed and used to gain insight into transmission dynamics of emerging and re-emerging diseases of public health interest. The models, typically of the forms of deterministic or stochastic systems of non-linear differential equations, are used to evaluate various control strategies such as: vaccination, the use of antibiotics or antivirals, quarantine, isolation, etc. Of the aforementioned control strategies, the use of quarantine (of individuals suspected of being exposed to the disease) and isolation (of those with clinical symptoms of the disease) are the most commonly used (since the beginning of recorded human history). These measures have been used in the control of numerous diseases such as leprosy, plague, cholera, typhus, yellow fever, smallpox, diphtheria, tuberculosis, measles, ebola, pandemic influenza and, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [3], [11], [18], [19], [20], [5], [22], [29], [31], [32]. Furthermore, quarantine and isolation are popularly applied to combat the spread of animal diseases such as bovine tuberculosis, rinderpest, foot-and-mouth, psittacosis, Newcastle disease and rabies [11], [14]. It is known, however, that quarantine and isolation measures, especially in the context of a new emerging disease, are initially not administered effectively, but are gradually refined (as more data and knowledge of the disease transmission process becomes available (see, for instance, [8])).",

However, some recent studies [7], [30] show that it is more realistic to use gamma distribution assumption for the waiting time in the disease stages (rather than exponential distribution assumption). Furthermore, Feng et al. [7] showed that quarantine and isolation models that assume exponential distribution (for the disease stages) may not be suitable for diseases with relatively long latent and/or infectious periods for the case when isolation is not completely effective (i.e., isolated individuals can transmit infection).",

The model to be designed extends the SEIQHR model given in [24] by considering multiple stages of the exposed, infectious, quarantined and hospitalized individuals (unlike in [24], it is assumed here that hospitalized individuals do not transmit the infection).

Hence, F is a Lyapunov function on D. Therefore, by the LaSalle\u2019s Invariance Principle [9],(10)limt\u2192\u221eEi(t)=0,for alli=1,\u2026,m;limt\u2192\u221eIj(t)=0,for allj=1,\u2026,n.It is clear from (10) that lim supt\u2192\u221e\nE\n1\n = 0. Thus, for sufficiently small \u03d6\n1\n > 0, there exists a constant N\n1\n > 0 such that lim supt\u2192\u221e\nE\n1\n \u2a7d \n\u03d6\n1 for all t\n > \nN\n1. It follows from the (m\n + \nn\n + 2)th equation of the model (6) that, for t\n > \nN\n1,Q\u02d91\u2a7d\u03c31\u03d61-km+n+1Q1.Thus, by comparison theorem [26],Q1\u221e=limsupt\u2192\u221eQ1\u2a7d\u03c31\u03d61km+n+1,so that, by letting \u03d6\n1\n \u2192 0,(11)Q1\u221e=limsupt\u2192\u221eQ1\u2a7d0.Similarly (by using lim inft\u2192\u221e\nE\n1\n = 0), it can be shown that(12)Q1\u221e=liminft\u2192\u221eQ1\u2a7e0.Thus, it follows from (11), (12) thatQ1\u221e\u2a7e0\u2a7eQ1\u221e.Hence,(13)limt\u2192\u221eQ1=0.Similarly, it can be shown that(14)limt\u2192\u221eQi(t)=0,for alli=2,\u2026,m,limt\u2192\u221eHj(t)=0,for allj=1,\u2026,n,limt\u2192\u221eR(t)=0,limt\u2192\u221eS(t)=\u03a0/\u03bc.Thus, by combining (10), (13), (14), it follows that every solution of the equations in the model (6), with initial conditions in D, approaches the DFE, \u03a9\n0, as t\n \u2192 \u221e when Rc\u2a7d1. \u25a1\n",

Fig. 2\ndepicts numerical results obtained by simulating the model (6), with m\n = 2 and n\n = 3, using various initial conditions for the case Rc<1. All solutions converged to the DFE, \u03a9\n0, (in line with Theorem 2). It should be mentioned that, unless otherwise stated, simulations of the model (6) are carried out using the parameter values in Table 2, Table 4\n. These parameter values are consistent with those associated with the 2003 SARS outbreaks [2], [5], [22], [8], [17]. It is worth mentioning that the progressive refinement of quarantine and isolation measures is incorporated in all numerical simulations in this study (unless otherwise stated) by using smaller values of \u03c3\n1 and \u03c3\n2, in comparison to \u03c3\n3; and also smaller values of \u03d5\n1 and \u03d5\n2, in relation to \u03d5\n3 (see Table 4\n).",

The results obtained, depicted in Fig. 6\n, show an increase in the cumulative number of disease-related mortality with increasing values of m\n = \nn. Simulations for the cumulative number of probable SARS cases observed during the 2003 outbreaks in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) of Canada are also carried out. The results obtained, for the case m\n = \nn\n = 3, are compared with those obtained using the exponentially-distributed (ED) equivalent of the model (6) (i.e., model (6) with m\n = \nn\n = 1) and another gamma-distributed version of the model (6) with m\n = \nn\n = 3, denoted by GD2, where the average sojourn time in each of the exposed, quarantined, hospitalized and infectious stages is shared equally among each associated disease stage (this is similar to the model given in [7]). It should be mentioned that, in such a setting, the standard ED model has the associated reproduction number given by Rc=0.6506. Similarly, the GD2 and GD1 models have Rc=0.6962 and Rc=0.9858, respectively. Furthermore, about 250 probable SARS cases were reported for the GTA (see Fig. 2 in [8]). The simulation results obtained, depicted in Fig. 7\n, show that while the ED and GD2 models under-estimated the observed number of probable cases, the GD1 model (6) gave a very good estimate of the observed data. It should be mentioned that the GD2 model is also competitive if the quarantine and isolation rates are distributed (unequally) to incorporate their progressive refinement (as in the case of the model GD1).",

The model, which is based on the assumption that the mean waiting periods in all infected classes obey a gamma distribution, adopts a standard incidence formulation for the infection rate. An important feature of this model is that it allows for equal or unequal distribution of the sojourn time in each of the associated infected compartment. Furthermore, it allows for the gradual refinement of quarantine and isolation measures (this was the case during the 2003 SARS outbreaks). The main theoretical findings of the study are given below:(i)The model (6) has a globally-asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium whenever the associated reproduction number (Rc) is less than unity.(ii)The model has a unique endemic equilibrium whenever the reproduction number exceeds unity.(iii)The unique endemic equilibrium of the model is shown to be globally-asymptotically stable for a special case.\n",
