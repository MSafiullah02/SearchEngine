Their genomes are relatively small, comprising slightly more than 4000 nucleotides with three to four open reading frames. Umbraviruses differ from most other viruses in that they do not encode a coat protein (CP) such that conventional virus particles are not formed in infected plants.12 Nevertheless, they accumulate and spread efficiently within the infected plant since their lack of a CP is compensated for by the ORF3 protein (26\u201329 kDa). The ORF3 protein fulfils umbraviral functions that are normally provided by the CPs of other plant viruses, such as long-distance movement of viral RNA through the phloem.13\n,\n14\n",

            "text": "Our recent studies have shown that, upon GRV infection, the ORF3 protein produced in the cytoplasm enters the nucleus and is targeted to CBs. The CBs are reorganized and move to and fuse with the nucleolus by an unknown mechanism.10 Finally, the ORF3 protein is exported from the nucleus leading to the formation of viral RNP particles in cytoplasmic inclusions. This transport pathway is absolutely required for the formation of these particles that are themselves essential for the long-distance spread of the virus and systemic infection. The purpose of this nuclear/nucleolar trafficking of the ORF3 protein is to recruit and relocalize some of the nuclear pool of fibrillarin to the cytoplasm (fibrillarin normally does not accumulate in cytoplasm).10\n,\n11 Our studies have also demonstrated a direct physical interaction between fibrillarin and ORF3 protein that is involved in at least two stages in the GRV life cycle: (1) CB fusion with the nucleolus and (2) the formation of viral RNP particles that are capable of long-distance movement, causing systemic viral infection. This model demonstrates completely novel functions for fibrillarin in triggering nucleolar import of the ORF3 protein via CBs and mediating assembly of umbraviral RNPs. Thus, the interaction of the GRV ORF3 protein with fibrillarin in CBs triggers all the molecular and cellular events necessary to establish a systemic infection, and hence, formation of the fibrillarin\u2013ORF3 protein complexes appears to be the key prerequisite for both these processes. Here, we determine the architecture of these complexes using atomic force microscopy (AFM) as a high-resolution technique, which has been shown to be successful in studies of proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes.15, 16, 17, 18 We also estimate the molar ratio of fibrillarin to ORF3 protein in the complexes as approximately 1:1. Based on these data, we propose a model of the structural organization of fibrillarin\u2013ORF3 protein complexes and discuss the potential implications that may also apply to other virus life cycles.",

            "text": "In preliminary experiments, purified recombinant ORF3 protein and fibrillarin were visualized separately. The ORF3 protein tagged with six histidine residues (ORF3\u2013His) was expressed from a tobacco mosaic virus vector in tobacco plants and isolated as described previously.14 Recombinant fibrillarin [Arabidopsis fibrillarin 2 (Fib2);2 \u223c 35 kDa] was expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli either as a fusion with glutathione S-transferase with a consequent removal of glutathione S-transferase from fibrillarin by thrombin treatment as described by Kim et al.\n11 or as a fusion with six histidine residues (fibrillarin\u2013His). Most of the fibrillarin molecules were observed in AFM as randomly distributed small granules with a height of 1.9 \u00b1 0.3 nm (data here and below represent means \u00b1 SD for 50 different granules or complexes) and an apparent diameter measured at half of the height of about 10.0 \u00b1 1.1 nm. It should be noted, however, that in AFM images, horizontal dimensions of objects are usually greatly overestimated due to the well-known effect of tip convolution. The lateral dimension of the fibrillarin molecule was estimated as 3.2 \u00b1 0.4 nm, using the method of Stemmer and Engel.19 Given the uniform size of these molecules, they probably represent monomers of fibrillarin. The height of ORF3 protein molecules was not uniform and varied from 1.6 to 4.2 nm, representing at least three classes of particles of 1.6 \u00b1 0.2, 3.1 \u00b1 0.3, and 4.0 \u00b1 0.3 nm. This confirms our previous biochemical data that the ORF3 protein preparations were not homogeneous and can form dimers and higher-order associations.14 This suggests that the smaller particles (with a height of 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 nm) correspond to monomers, whereas the bigger ones (with a height of 3.1 \u00b1 0.3 and 4.0 \u00b1 0.3 nm) represent dimers and trimers of the ORF3 protein. About 60% of the preparation was represented by the putative monomers.",

The height of the granules (2.0 \u00b1 0.4 nm) approximately corresponded to the heights of fibrillarin and ORF3 monomers, suggesting that the rings formed by these granules represent single-layered chains of the molecules. Given that neither the ORF3 protein nor fibrillarin alone can form such rings, it is likely that the rings consist of both the ORF3 protein and fibrillarin. While the height of the granules forming the rings was comparable with the heights of ORF3 protein and fibrillarin monomers, their width (5.5 \u00b1 0.6 nm) could possibly correspond to protein dimers formed either by two ORF3 protein molecules or by an ORF3 and fibrillarin protein molecule (fibrillarin does not form dimers or oligomers as shown above). Electron microscopy (EM) detected similar rings formed by mixing the ORF3 protein and fibrillarin in vitro (Fig. 1b).11 Rings showing apparent granular structures in EM also exhibited six, seven, or eight granules per ring in approximately equal ratio (of 50 ringlike complexes, 16 complexes contained six granules, 18 complexes contained seven granules, and 16 complexes contained eight granules).",

This suggests that granules in the ORF3\u2013fibrillarin complexes correspond to either heterologous dimers of ORF3 protein (26\u201329 kDa) and fibrillarin (35 kDa) molecules or potentially homologous dimers of ORF3 protein molecules. However, we have previously shown that fibrillarin and ORF3 interact with one another through single domains on each protein: the glycine- and arginine-rich domain (GAR domain) of fibrillarin and the leucine-rich domain of ORF3.11 In line with these observations, no ringlike complexes were formed with the ORF3 L149A mutant (Fig. 1c). This mutant has the leucine at position 149 replaced with alanine and is unable to interact with fibrillarin.11 A fibrillarin mutant lacking the GAR domain (Fib2\u0394GAR)11 was also unable to form ringlike complexes. For both of these mutants, only smaller particles apparently corresponding to individual granules of the ORF3 protein (monomers and oligomers of higher order) and fibrillarin were observed (Fig. 1c). Therefore, the most likely interpretation, given the equimolar ratio of ORF3 and fibrillarin in the ringlike complexes, is that the ORF3\u2013fibrillarin interaction leads to formation of individual heterodimers (\u201cgranules\u201d) with a molecular mass of \u223c 63 kDa. The higher-order ring complexes are formed by additional ORF3\u2013ORF3 association, which has been demonstrated previously14 (Fig. 2c).",

Thus, the ringlike complexes may occur in the CBs and move to the nucleolus by virtue of the fusion of the CBs with the nucleolus. However, it is also possible that complexes could move from CBs to the nucleolus independently of CB fusion, or that some of the ORF3 protein pool enters the nucleolus via CBs as uncomplexed molecules, and interact with fibrillarin in the nucleolus to form ORF3\u2013fibrillarin complexes for export to cytoplasm.",

            "text": "The biological relevance of the ringlike complexes is demonstrated by two observations. Firstly, such structures were observed when ORF3 and fibrillarin were mixed in vitro and the addition of GRV RNA to the mixture led to the formation of infectious regular filamentous structures similar to viral RNP particles formed in vivo following GRV infection.11 Secondly, ringlike structures containing the ORF3 protein with sizes similar to those of the ORF3 protein\u2013fibrillarin complexes described here have also been found in plants infected with GRV.14 This observation also indicates that potential posttranslational modifications of fibrillarin in plants (such as, e.g., the arginine dimethylation of mammalian and yeast fibrillarin orthologues21) are probably not essential for production of the ringlike complexes because, in our work, fibrillarin was expressed in and purified from E. coli and would therefore not be modified. Moreover, it has been reported that the lack of posttranslational modifications in bacterially expressed mammalian fibrillarin does not prevent it from interactions with other proteins.7\n,\n21 Importantly, the height and diameter of the rings formed by ORF3 protein and fibrillarin in vitro are about 2.0 \u00b1 0.4 nm and 18\u201322 nm, respectively, and therefore, they could be exported from the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex. For example, intact nucleocapsids of human hepatitis B virus with diameters of 32 and 36 nm are able to cross the nuclear pore without disassembly.22 This suggests that the ORF3 protein and fibrillarin can move from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as ringlike complexes. Furthermore, in the cytoplasm, fibrillarin, along with the ORF3 protein and viral RNA, takes part in the assembly of infectious long-distance movement-competent RNP particles.11\n,\n14 These particles have a filamentous structure with regular helical elements but not the uniformity typical of virus particles. The diameter of these filamentous particles is \u223c 18\u201320 nm, which correlates with that of the ORF3 protein\u2013fibrillarin rings (18\u201322 nm). Thus, the rings formed by these proteins interact with viral RNA, encapsidating it and reorganizing it into helical structures, and thereby play a key role in the assembly of umbraviral RNP complexes. Whether the rings stack on the RNA or nucleate, the addition and assembly of the RNP are unknown.",
