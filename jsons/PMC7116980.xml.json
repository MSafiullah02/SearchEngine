Sustainable development is viewed as the development that meets the current needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs [1]. The transportation sector is important as it relates to sustainability because this sector supports the economy and most social activities and has substantial environmental impact [2]. Thus, a well-established urban transportation system should not only harmonize economic growth with land-use planning and promote the use of public transit systems but also conserve resources and be environmentally friendly [3], [4], [5].",

According to Taiwan\u2019s Statistical Abstract of Transportation and Communications [8], the number of registered vehicles in Taiwan rose from 4.7 million in 1980 to 21.3 million in September 2014. This rise was a consequence of the increase in individual disposable income, the opening of the first national north\u2013south expressway in 1978, and the subsequent improvement of the highway infrastructure: a second national north\u2013south expressway, a west coast highway, and an east\u2013west highway, among others. Along with the rapid growth of the number of motor vehicles, energy consumption in the road transportation sector reached the equivalent of 13,272 kl of oil in 2013, which was 3.37 times higher than that in 1980, and accounted for 95.75% of aggregate transport fuel demand. The amount of CO2 emitted in the road transportation system increased at an annual rate of 4.38% per annum, from 8.2 million tons in 1980 to an estimated 33.7 million tons in 2013.",

Interpreting the inherent mechanisms of the system and capturing the dynamic behavior of the components with analytical methods, such as decomposition analysis, grey theory, least-squares regression, and geometric average method, are not easy because the database is limited and because these subsystems are interlinked and dependent on each other. System dynamics (SD) provide a simulation platform to analyze a large-scale and complex socioeconomic system with multiple variables that change over time. With the aid of an SD model, we selected Kaohsiung as a case study to explore the effects of variations in demographics, fuel prices, and economic growth rate, among other factors, on the number of vehicles, fuel consumption, and energy-related CO2 emissions. In addition, we developed three scenarios based on the possible policies that could be adopted by the city government to simulate their potential both for reducing the vehicular fuel consumption and for mitigating CO2 emissions in Kaohsiung.",

An urban dynamics model was then constructed to show the effects of the interactions among business, housing, and people on the growth pattern of a city. Finally, a large and complex socioeconomic simulation system, i.e., World Dynamics, was developed [20]. The world socioeconomic system might collapse if actions are not taken to slow population growth and the continuous and unrestrained exploitation of natural resources.",

An SD model was developed to explore the interrelationships among population, economy, housing, transport, and urban land in Hong Kong; the long-term constraints of and potentials for urban development yielded by the study were offered as policy suggestions for city planning [39].

This study examines three main urban transportation policies in our proposed model: fuel tax, motorcycle parking management, and free bus service. Prior studies mainly investigate the effect of a particular policy, such as fuel tax in Europe and the US [57]; parking management policies in China [58]; and free bus policy in Japan, Belgium, and England [60], [61], [62]. A limited number of studies analyze the effect of these policies on energy consumption and CO2 emission reduction simultaneously and compare the respective policy with the synthetic policy to compare the policy effectiveness. Our study aims to fill this research gap by developing a systematic and simplified analytical tool that can help urban planners to evaluate the influence of various transportation policies on energy consumption and CO2 emission reduction.",

We analyzed this subsystem to evaluate the effect of the changes in the level of the individual disposable income and in the size of the economically active population on the variation of the number of private cars. According to the 2008 survey of MOTC, the number of private cars driven decreased by 33.8% after fuel prices increased by 13.45%. Thus, the effect of fuel prices on the variations of automobile use was also considered because of the rise in the price of crude oil, which has almost doubled since the beginning of 2007.",

Moreover, the central and city government did not provide strong incentives, including direct subsidies, fiscal reduction, and regulatory policy, to increase the use of electric vehicles. In terms of user perspectives, short driving range and slow speed of electric vehicles lead to the less popularity of electric vehicles in Taiwan. Even when considering improvements in the fuel economy of vehicles, we observe that the dense traffic in Kaohsiung requires the car to stop and go frequently. Thus, fuel economy improvements of vehicles are not significant in the local context. Therefore, the policy imposing fuel tax seems to remain useful in Kaohsiung.",

Specifically, the decrease in the number of commuters who switched from using private cars to using the KMRT was estimated by combining the average number of passengers carried by the KMRT, the average number of kilometers per passenger trip, the average number of occupants per automobile, and the transfer ratio.

Hence, the effect of fuel prices on mode choice and mode transfer was further incorporated into the model through the operation of flow variables: mode transfer from private cars and the decrease in motorcycle use by fuel price increase (Appendix A). In addition, the formulation of vehicular fuel consumption and associated CO2 emissions derived from the number of motorcycles was the same as that from the number of private cars, but the average occupancy rate (the number of passengers per motorcycle) and the transfer ratio between the KMRT and motorcycles were different.",

However, in the next 11 years, the growth rate of the GDP of Taiwan is expected to be lower than those during the past two decades.

For example, our simulation predicts that the annual growth rate of individual disposable income from 2014 to 2025 will be 1.95%, which is lower than previous rates.

Overall, the number of vehicles in 2025 is estimated to be 1.3 million (Fig. 2\n), which is 13.2% lower than the base. This reduction in the number of motor vehicles caused by the increase in fuel prices will lead to changes in the modal shares of the means of transport. Under this policy, the projected growth of vehicular energy consumption varies from 991,822 kl to 992,053 kl from 2008 to 2025. During the same period, motor-vehicle CO2 emissions are expected to increase by 267,664 metric tons. Compared with the reference model, the energy requirements and CO2 emissions in 2025 are predicted to be 11.0% and 9.9% lower, respectively.",

Under these measures, the number of passengers carried by mass transit increased by about 60 million. In 2005, the Taipei City government introduced a successful parking management program that prohibits motorcycles from being parked on sidewalks and in building arcades, requires payment for roadside motorcycle parking, and offers a parking-information inquiry system. The ownership of motorcycles in Kaohsiung City is 71.5%, the highest in Taiwan. From the success of this policy, Kaohsiung introduced a similar system to other popular centers such as night markets, train stations, and department stores since April 2012 to reduce motorcycle use.",

According to the simulation, the results indicate that the number of vehicles in Kaohsiung City will decrease to 0.95 million vehicles in 2025, which is 36.6% lower than the base model (Fig. 5\n). In terms of the variation in vehicular fuel requirement, the variable will increase slightly from 908,169 kl to 916,558 kl from 2008 to 2025. Compared with the value at the end of 2025, the value is 17.8% lower than that in the reference model. The growth patterns of CO2 emission and energy demand are similar because the variation of CO2 levels is directly related to energy consumption. Thus, the contribution of aggregate CO2 emission will be 2.34 million metric tons until 2025, which is lower by 0.44 million metric tons than the emission amount in the base model. From the observations of the forecasted patterns, the aggregate CO2 emission needs to be reduced by about 0.15 million metric tons compared with the emission level in 2000. This result implies the difficulties and urgency of CO2 mitigation in Kaohsiung City, despite the synthetic policy being considered in the SD model.",
