TCoV is an enveloped virus with a 28-kb-long single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome (Cao et al., 2008; Gomaa et al., 2008; Jackwood et al., 2010). Together with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), TCoV is one of the two most economically significant avian coronaviruses. Unlike IBV, however, TCoV has not been adapted to grow in cell cultures and can only be propagated in ovo or in vivo.",

More recently, TCoV and several other agents (viruses, bacteria, protozoa, fungi) have been associated with poult enteritis complex (PEC) (Barnes & Guy, 2003). PEC is a general term for a group of multifactorial, transmissible infectious diseases of young turkey poults up to 7 weeks of age, with signs including enteritis, retarded development, impaired feed utilization and frequent immune dysfunction (Barnes et al., 2000). PEC severely affects turkey production (Barnes et al., 2000).",

A coronavirus was also detected in turkeys with enteritis in Italy (Moreno Martin et al., 2002). In France, since 2003, the number of turkey flocks exhibiting clinical signs compatible with PEC has increased and PEC has become an important concern (Germain & Rousseau, 2005). A survey performed from 2007 to 2009 and based on a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay specific for the nucleocapsid gene of IBV and TCoV (Maurel et al., 2009) revealed that 37% of turkey flocks suspected of PEC were positive for TCoV, whereas only 17% were positive among flocks without enteritis or with an enteritis not evocative of Poult Enteritis (PEC)/Mortality Syndrome (PEMS). The virus was found predominantly in the digestive contents (41% in the jejunum, 39% in the caecum) (Maurel et al., 2011). The genetic characterization of French strains of TCoV (Fr TCoV) demonstrated that although they are related to their North American (NA TCoV) counterparts, they form an independent sublineage and might have been generated by recombination events involving different IBV strains than those involved in the emergence of NA TCoV (Jackwood et al., 2010; Maurel et al., 2011). Interestingly, the IBVs most related to Fr TCoV appeared to be 4/91 and QX (ITA/90254/2005), respectively, which represent some of the more recently emerged IBV serotypes in Europe (Worthington et al., 2008).",

Out of 40 eggs inoculated by four people, 38 were suitable for analysis of the inoculation point. Inoculation proved to have been performed into the amniotic sac, yolk sac or allantoic fluid in 34 (89%), three (8%) and one (3%) of the inoculated eggs, respectively. The comparison of the results by the different manipulators showed that the percentage success ranged from 6/9 (66%) for one person to 10/10 (100%) for two others.

The results observed at 42 and 40 days strongly suggested that the starting inoculum was so diluted when inoculated into the embryonated eggs that the viral genome could not be detected, unless TCoV replication occurred in the inoculated eggs, as was observed after 0 days of storage.

These temperatures were selected as representative of the mean summer (+16.6 to +19.2\u00b0C) and winter (+5.9 to +6.2\u00b0C) temperatures in Brittany, the largest poultry-producing area in France, over the 1981 to 2010 period (http://www.meteo-bretagne.fr/normales-climatiques-Rennes). Indeed, in this region and during this period, the mean number of days above +25\u00b0C or below 0\u00b0C did not exceed 39.6 and 33.5 days, respectively. In addition, the +4\u00b0C temperature is likely to be comparable with temperature during refrigerated shipment of unfrozen biological samples. However, our study does not mimic the survival of virus in litter or dried faeces, and so forth, where relative humidity is different. The use of a virus suspension, instead of dried viruses on surfaces, decreased the risk of titre variation, simplified the study, and gave consistent data. This simplified protocol was all the more interesting as this virus does not grow in cell culture, requiring a multi-step procedure for titration of the virus, comprising embryonated SPF turkey eggs, embryo dissection and real-time RT-PCR. Another significant improvement would have been to start with a virus titre initially higher, in order to obtain values of decrease in virus titre on a larger scale. However, this was not possible because titres obtained when propagating Fr TCoV in turkey eggs currently did not exceed 4 log10 EID50/ml, a titre that could not be increased either by inoculating the embryonated SPF turkey eggs at a younger age or by increasing the passage level of Fr TCoV in eggs (data not shown).",

Our data, being obtained from viruses in suspension, most closely compare with data obtained under 80% relative humidity.

At +4\u00b0C MHV and TGEV persistence was longer, showing a titre decline after 28 days of 3.2 and 2.5 log10 for TGEV and MHV, respectively.

An early study of IBV survival in lyophilized preparations (Hofstad & Yoder, 1963) can hardly be compared with the present study due to the presentation of the samples being so different. Lyophilized IBV strains 33 and 97 both exhibited a similar decay in titre (about 2.3 log10 EID50/ml) when stored for 30 days at +37\u00b0C, but no loss in virus titre was measured when the viruses were stored at +4\u00b0C for the same time. This is consistent with a greater thermal stability of avian coronaviruses at lower temperatures. In another study dating back to the same period, the presence of salts in solution was shown to stabilize the titre of the IBV-42 (Beaudette) strain at +25\u00b0C. Indeed, the virus titre strongly decreased by 3.5 log10 EID50/ml when incubated for only 15 minutes at +25\u00b0C, whereas it was stable in salt solution (Hopkins, 1967). Clearly, more recent studies on the stability of IBV in the environment are required if comparisons are to be made between TCoV and IBV. In general, the data available regarding animal coronaviruses are in the same range. Virus survival ranges from 1 to 2 weeks at +20\u00b0C, whereas survival is longer than 20 days at +4\u00b0C.",

Indeed, the strain used in this study (080385d) was isolated from a diseased flock in November, usually a rather cold and humid period in western France. However, this may not reflect the seasonality of enteric disorders in France. In their survey of 81 French turkey flocks, performed during the period 2007 to 2009, Maurel et al. (2009) detected 24 flocks positive for Fr TCoV. Fifteen of these flocks (63%) were detected during warm periods (spring\u2013summer), as compared with only nine flocks (37%) in autumn and winter. Although this survey was not designed to precisely assess seasonality of Fr TCoV infections, the annual distribution of PEC reports to the French Nationwide Network for Epidemiological Observations in Poultry (RNOEA) (Souillard et al., 2007) confirms that the proportion of PEC cases declared from 2007 to 2011 was higher during the warmer periods (77% of the total declared PEC cases) than during the colder ones (23% of the total reported cases) (Toux & Souillard, personal communication, 2011). The period of highest PEC incidence hence appears not to be the most favourable for Fr TCoV survival in the environment. However, it should be remembered that PEC is a multifactorial syndrome, so that the reported PEC cases may be caused by a variety of agents (Fr TCoV, astroviruses, reoviruses, adenoviruses, bacteria, etc.), some of which may account for additional summer cases. Furthermore, the survival of Fr TCoV is only one possible factor that might contribute to the seasonality of the disease, and other possibly more significant interfering factors, such as possible vectors or seasonality of turkey production, might also play a role, so that Fr TCoV virus survival according to the outdoor temperature might not be the most important parameter for its transmission between turkey flocks.",
