Asthma prevalence is increasing in many countries, and exacerbations are the main cause of asthma morbidity and result in very substantial health-care costs.",

Severity was assessed by the change in mean lower respiratory-tract symptoms or PEF measurements from the week before to the week after the start of infection. NO2 exposure was determined (after logarithmic transformation) from the weighted daily average of the two consecutive 1-week exposure measurements that overlapped the 7-day period. In anticipation of missing NO2 measurements, lower respiratory-tract symptom scores, or PEF measurements during the exposure periods, we decided a priori that at least four of the seven daily personal NO2 exposures, symptom scores, and PEF rates were needed for the event to be included in analyses.",

A risk ratio of 1\u00b72 for increments of 30 \u03bcg/m3 indoor NO2 exposure (equivalent to the presence of a gas cooker in the home) was derived from a meta-analysis of 11 studies.3 From our pilot study we expected a 30 \u03bcg/m3 equivalent difference in the personal NO2 exposure between the lowest and highest tertiles. We did simulations to assess the effect of the absence of independence of episodes within a child, and this seemed to have a minimal effect on estimates of the standard errors of the coefficient for NO2 exposure. Even with extremely high correlation between episodes within children, the standard error only increased by 14%. If three to four episodes were reported per child, we anticipated 70% to 80% power, respectively, based on standard methods for the analysis of proportions, with the assumption of a risk ratio of 1\u00b72 for children distributed between the highest and lowest tertiles. Furthermore, we anticipated the power of the analysis would be further improved by use of actual personal NO2 values in a regression model rather than crude categorical differences in exposure such as the presence or absence of a gas cooker. We estimated that with a sample size of 100\u2013120 children, we would have sufficient power to test our main objectives.",

Continuous personal NO2 monitoring was needed to capture exposures accurately immediately before and after the start of an infection. Less frequent monitoring would have been inadequate because of the significant week to week variability in NO2 exposures in children of this age, as reported in our pilot study.12 Although the measurement of personal NO2 exposure improved the quality of data compared with static indoor NO2 monitoring in the home, we estimated 7-day exposures before an infection by the weighted average of exposure in the two adjacent weeks. This approach would be expected to mask any relation between exposure and asthma exacerbations if exposure was misclassified. Furthermore, the use of a panel of RT-PCR assays identified many more infections than would have been possible with less sensitive conventional diagnostic methods.15\n",

In a study of 46 children aged 9\u201311 years, personal NO2 exposure was assessed in parallel with measurements in the child's home, classroom, and school outdoors for three week-long periods. Although personal exposures correlated weakly with concentrations of NO2 recorded in the home, the relation was far from precise. Factors associated with increased personal exposure included the use of gas appliances, cohabitation with smokers, and travel to school by means other than a car. However, together these variables explained less than 30% of the temporal variation in personal exposures.12 We have also investigated the relation between fluctuations in personal NO2 exposure in this group of Southampton schoolchildren and changes in outdoor NO2 concentrations measured at a fixed site in the centre of Southampton for 32 weeks. Of the 114 children monitored in the study, all but two lived within 20 km of the outdoor monitoring station, and 50 were resident in the city (near major roads). We confirmed that there was great variation from week to week in personal NO2 exposure in children and that little, if any, of this variation was the result of fluctuations in the concentrations of NO2 in outdoor air, even when the analyses were restricted to children residing in the city and those from homes that did not use gas for cooking.18 Despite any limitation in recording mean personal NO2 exposure per week, the findings from both studies emphasised the need for personal monitoring of NO2 exposure instead of outdoor and indoor measurements to reduce misclassification of true exposure, which could reduce the power of the study and mask any important health effect.",

It is noteworthy that the trends indicating an association between NO2 exposure and severity of asthma exacerbation were consistent in direction for all viruses, for picornavirus and for respiratory syncytial virus, but not coronavirus (figure 1). Both respiratory syncytial viruses and picornaviruses are known to infect the lower respiratory tract,32 but there is no evidence to show that this is the case for coronaviruses. The absence of an association with coronavirus could be because the numbers of such infections were small or because they might not interact with NO2 in the way that respiratory syncytial virus or picornavirus do. Or perhaps, they are unable to infect the lower respiratory tract, a suggestion that is supported by previous findings that coronaviruses are much less likely than other virus types to cause a drop in PEF or an increase in lower respiratory-tract symptoms in asthmatic children aged 9\u201311 years.6\n",

The increase was more than 2 points (the equivalent of transition from none to moderate, or mild to severe symptoms) for respiratory syncytial virus alone. However, although the absolute increase in severity of LRT scores and reductions in PEF were modest, they should be interpreted within the context of several factors. First, the increase in the median lower respiratory-tract symptom scores between the week before and after infection was 1 (arbitrary units), and likewise, the reduction in PEF between the same was 16 L/min. Therefore, the increased severity of these symptom scores represents increases of 60\u2013200%, and reductions in PEF of 75% compared with changes in median scores between the weeks before and after infection for all children. Second, the major site of NO2-induced lung injury is the transitional zone (the area between the terminal bronchioles and alveoli),33 so conventional pulmonary function tests (such as PEF) that are sensitive to changes in large airway function might be an insensitive method of detecting the responses in small peripheral airways. Third, as most children in this study used \u03b22 agonists (87%), symptom severity and decrements in peak expiratory flow might have been diminished and led to the effects of NO2 exposure and virus infections being underestimated if measured during an exacerbation. Although reductions in peak expiratory flow and increases in lower respiratory-tract symptoms were small, because of the ubiquitous nature of NO2 exposure the proportion of children exposed would lead to a large number with attributable morbidity if applied to the general population of asthmatic children.",

Likewise, 20% of children who had personal NO2 exposures of more than 100 \u03bcg/m3 are likely to have had peak concentrations of 300\u2013500 \u03bcg/m3 at least once. Such concentrations are higher than would be expected from other sources of NO2, and would exceed thresholds judged safe by WHO air quality standards.17\n",
