The disease was first reported to occur in 1990 in shrimp farms in central Thailand (Limsuwan, 1991). Typical signs of yellow head disease (YHD) include cessation of feeding and erratic swimming, and moribund shrimp often display a pale yellowish hue of the cephalothorax due to discoloration of the underlying hepatopancreas (Chantanachookin et al., 1993). Although the impact of YHD in Asia was quickly overshadowed by the subsequent emergence and explosive spread on white spot disease, yellow head outbreaks remain a serious concern for farmers, commonly resulting in total crop loss within 3 days of the first appearance of dead or moribund shrimp at the pond edge (Flegel et al., 1997, Walker et al., 2001). However, this important pathogen is poorly understood with relatively little information yet available on either the epidemiology of YHD or the molecular biology of YHV infection.",

            "text": "YHV is (+) ssRNA virus that, together with closely related Gill-associated virus (GAV) from Australia, has recently been classified in the family Roniviridae, genus Okavirus within the order Nidovirales (Walker et al., 2004). YHV virions are rod-shaped, enveloped particles (approximately 70 nm \u00d7 180 nm) with prominent surface spikes and an internal helical nucleocapsid (Wongteerasupaya et al., 1995, Nadala et al., 1997). Three YHV structural proteins have been described, transmembrane glycoproteins gp116 and gp64, which are located in the viral envelope, and the nucleoprotein p20 which is the only protein known to be present in nucleocapsids (Jitrapakdee et al., 2003, Soowannayan et al., 2003). For GAV, the 26,235 nt genome has been sequenced and reported to contain at least four long open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1a and ORF1b are in overlapping frames and encode non-structural proteins, including a 3C-like proteinase and enzymes of the replication complex (Cowley et al., 2000, Ziebuhr et al., 2003). ORF1b is expressed from a genome-length polyadenylated mRNA only following a \u22121 ribosomal frame-shift at a putative pseudoknot structure in the ORF1a/1b overlap region (Cowley et al., 2000). ORF3 has been shown to encode a long polyprotein with multiple N-linked glycosylation sites and membrane-spanning domains (Cowley and Walker, 2002). GAV ORF2 has recently been shown to encode the GAV nucleoprotein\u2014a remarkable observation as, in all other known nidoviruses (including coronaviruses, toroviruses and arteriviruses), the nucleoprotein gene is located downstream (5\u2032-proximate) rather than upstream (3\u2032-proximate) of the glycoprotein genes (Cowley et al., 2004).",

ORF1b has been shown to share 80.5% overall nucleotide sequence identity with the cognate gene of GAV and encodes a polypeptide containing all recognized functional domains including polymerase, helicase and metal ion-binding sequence motifs (Sittidilokratna et al., 2002). YHV structural glycoproteins gp116 and gp64 have been shown to be encoded in ORF3 and generated by post-translational proteolytic cleavage of a long polyprotein (Jitrapakdee et al., 2003). In this paper, we describe the nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of YHV ORF2 and show that, like the cognate gene in GAV, it encodes the nucleocapsid protein p20. We also show that recombinant YHV nucleoprotein is expressed at high level E. coli and contains linear epitopes in the C-terminal domain that react with available nucleoprotein monoclonal antibodies.",

The ORF2 gene comprises 441 nucleotides and encodes a polypeptide of 146 amino acids with predicted molecular weight of 16 325.5 Da. The ORF2 amino acid sequence indicates a highly hydrophilic, basic polypeptide (pI\n = 9.9) with a predominance of basic (15.1%), acidic (9.6%) and hydrophilic polar (34.3%) residues. The linear distribution of charged amino acids is highly polar. The extreme N-terminal domain of 27 amino acids contains 9 of the 22 basic residues and no acidic residues; the extreme C-terminal domain contains 9 of the 14 acidic residues and only one basic residue. The ORF2 amino acid sequence also features a high proportion P and G residues (16.4%), which are commonly associated with angular turns in the secondary structure, and 6 potential phosphorylation sites (T9, S19, Y86, T112, S115 and S135) (Fig. 1a).",

Following induction, recombinant nucleoproteins truncated at the C-terminus by 9, 18 and 27 amino acids were expressed at similar levels and appeared in gels as 16, 14.5, and 13.5 kDa bands, respectively (Fig. 4a). The significant reduction in M\nr (5 kDa) following removal of the C-terminal 9 amino acids confirms that this short highly acidic domain is the primary cause of the difference between the observed M\nr and deduced molecular weight of the full-length nucleoprotein. Immunoblot analysis indicated each truncated nucleoprotein segment reacted with YHV polyclonal antiserum (Fig. 1, Fig. 4). In the \u039427-truncated protein, a second minor 14.5 kDa band detected by SDS-PAGE following induction also reacted strongly with the polyclonal antiserum. The origin of this band is not yet determined but monoclonal antibody reactions (see below) indicate that it also includes the \u039427 truncation.

            "text": "\nYellow head virus is an invertebrate nidovirus that is classified in the genus Okavirus of the family Roniviridae (Walker et al., 2004). Key criteria for the taxonomic placement of YHV and closely related Gill-associated virus (GAV) are the existence of a (+) ssRNA genome containing two overlapping long open-reading-frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are aligned during translation by a \u22121 ribosomal frame-shift, and a characteristic \u2018SDD\u2019 motif in the active site of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Cowley et al., 2000, Sittidilokratna et al., 2002). It has also been reported that the GAV genome is transcribed as a nested set of 3\u2032-coterminal sub-genomic mRNAs (Cowley et al., 2002). However, unlike the known vertebrate nidoviruses (coronaviruses, toroviruses and arteriviruses), the GAV nucleoprotein gene (ORF2) is located upstream, rather than downstream, of the glycoprotein gene (Cowley et al., 2004). In this paper, we confirm that the YHV nucleocapsid protein (p20) is also encoded in ORF2 which immediately precedes the gene encoding the transmembrane glycoproteins gp116 and gp64 (i.e. ORF3) (Jitrapakdee et al., 2003). The function of the YHV ORF2 gene is evident from the deduced amino acid sequence, which shares a high level identity (84%) with the GAV nucleoprotein. It is also demonstrated by the reaction of the E. coli-expressed recombinant ORF2 protein with YHV monoclonal antibody Y19 which is known to be specific for virion structural protein p20 (Sithigorngul et al., 2002), the only known polypeptide component of YHV nucleocapsids (Soowannayan et al., 2003). The unusual location of the YHV and GAV nucleoprotein genes may be a consequence of genetic recombination in an ancestral nidovirus. High-frequency genetic recombination is known to occur commonly in (+) ssRNA viruses, including nidoviruses (Lai et al., 1985, van der Most and Spaan, 1995, Snijder et al., 1991, Lai, 1992), and it has been proposed that the diverse structural and morphological characteristics of nidoviruses may have occurred by a modular evolutionary process that results in exchange by recombination of complete genes or gene sets (Snijder and Horzinek, 1993, Snijder and Horzinek, 1995, Snijder and Spaan, 1995).",

The deduced sequence indicates several unusual structural features that may contribute to aberrant migration in gels including a relatively high proportion of proline and glycine residues and a highly polar arrangement of charged residues. The discrepancy between predicted size and electrophoretic mobility is also evident in the His6-tagged full-length recombinant protein expressed in E. coli (Fig. 2). It was also observed that the expressed GST-fusion proteins containing the C-terminal half (Q74\u2013S146) and the CC quadrant (R110\u2013S146) of the nucleoprotein were retarded relative to the migration of fusion proteins containing other segments of similar size (Fig. 3). The 5 kDa reduction in M\nr following removal of the C-terminal 9 amino acids indicates that, despite the overall predominance of basic residues (pI\n = 9.9), this short highly acidic domain is primarily responsible for the relatively slow electrophoretic migration of the nucleoprotein.",

This region has a low antigenicity index (Hopp and Woods, 1981) and a low predicted surface probability (Janin, 1979) and may well be buried in the core of the folded nucleoprotein. The most intense reactions occurred with the acidic CC quadrant (R110\u2013S146), which also contained the epitopes for three available mouse monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies Y19 and YII4 each mapped to linear sites either within the deleted E129\u2013E137 segment or the upstream region spanning the point of truncation. Y19 and YII4 were derived from different cell fusions. Each reacts with both YHV and GAV and so must target highly conserved sequences comprising the 6\u20137 amino acids of a linear B cell epitope. This identifies the sequence IVPDPSL spanning the point of truncation as the only possible epitope for Y19 and YII4 (Fig. 1b). Monoclonal antibody Y20 is specific for YHV and so must target a 6\u20137 amino acid sequence that is not identical in GAV either within the deleted E129\u2013E137 segment or the upstream region spanning the point of truncation (Fig. 1b). This identifies a maximum span of 15 amino acids from D123 to E137 (DIENLAEGIHAMSLE) which contains a core of common sequence (N126\u2013M134). Therefore, the Y20 epitope must be located in one of the variable regions at either end of this 15 amino acid sequence.",
