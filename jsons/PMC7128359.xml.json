Such measures will complement efforts to reduce the likelihood of laboratory accidents involving SARS coronavirus.8 It may also be time to reconsider current standards for sharing technical information about emerging pathogens. Although dissemination of the genetic sequence of SARS coronavirus could advance research on countermeasures, it could also help those who intend harm. Greater accountability for access to such information is needed. The scientific and clinical communities should direct the structure and application of such regulations.",

Likewise, syndromic surveillance could miss the clues that an attack with SARS coronavirus is underway, especially if surveillance is limited in scope or not deployed near the location of the attack.9 Notably, the US anthrax attack was not recognised through elaborate sensors or surveillance networks but through the meticulous attention of a single clinician. Wide distribution of a validated, rapid diagnostic assay for the detection of SARS coronavirus in patients with a suspicious clinical syndrome will be a critical aid to detecting an attack.",
