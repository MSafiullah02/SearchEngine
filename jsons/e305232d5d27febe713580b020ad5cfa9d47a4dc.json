Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel zoonotic lineage C \u03b2CoV discovered in 2012 [2] . MERS-CoV infection in human, or MERS, commonly manifests as a severe acute respiratory disease, which is often complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure [3, 4] . Clinical deterioration and death occur rapidly and at a few days earlier in MERS than in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [3] . The case-fatality rate of MERS is the highest among all human CoV infections and exceeds 35% [3, 5] . Effective antiviral treatment, especially when given early to patients at risk of developing severe disease, may improve the clinical outcome of MERS. A number of new drug compounds, such as humanized or human monoclonal antibodies against the S1 subunit receptor-binding domain and antiviral peptides targeting the S2 subunit heptad repeat 2 domain of the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein, have recently been developed and showed potent anti-MERS-CoV activity in vitro [6] [7] [8] [9] . However, their developments are still in the preclinical phase. Another possible treatment option for MERS is convalescent-phase plasma therapy. This has been previously used to treat other severe viral respiratory infections, including SARS and pandemic influenza, with good clinical and virological response [10] [11] [12] . However, this is also not readily available, as its preparation requires the recruitment of a large number of convalescent patients with high serum antibody titers. Convalescent-phase plasma with low serum antibody titers may be associated with immune enhancement, which could lead to worsened outcome as observed in in vitro and animal experiments on SARS [13, 14] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 121, "end": 124, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 237, "end": 240, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 428, "end": 431, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 432, "end": 434, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 567, "end": 570, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 666, "end": 669, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 670, "end": 672, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1140, "end": 1143, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1144, "end": 1147, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1148, "end": 1151, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1152, "end": 1155, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1468, "end": 1472, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1473, "end": 1477, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1478, "end": 1482, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1842, "end": 1846, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1847, "end": 1850, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "In order to find immediately available treatment for MERS before these novel agents and convalescent-phase plasma therapy become available, we and others have applied highthroughput screening to identify existing drugs that may be repurposed to treat patients with MERS [15] [16] [17] .

Treatment with ribavirin and interferon-\u03b1 has shown some effects in vitro and in MERS-CoVinfected rhesus macaques with mild disease, but the benefits in MERS patients were not obvious [20] [21] [22] . In this study, we evaluated the treatment effects of MMF, lopinavir, and interferon-\u03b2 in MERS-CoV-infected common marmosets.

The recent large healthcare-associated outbreak involving more than 180 infected patients and over 5000 close contacts in South Korea reemphasizes the urgent need to find effective anti-MERS-CoV treatment. Drug repurposing is an especially advantageous approach, as repurposed drugs usually have well-known pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, side effects, and dosing regimens. These data would facilitate drug use in patients with severe MERS, who often have comorbidities or are complicated by multiorgan dysfunction. However, the lack of suitable animal models has been a major obstacle to evaluating countermeasures for MERS in the past 3 years. BALB/c mice, Syrian hamsters, and ferrets are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, while MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques only develop very mild and self-limiting disease [3, 21, [34] [35] [36] . Intranasal administration of adenoviral vectors encoding the human dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) receptor has been used to transduce and render BALB/ c and C57BL/6 mice susceptible to MERS-CoV infection [37] . Using this animal model, the treatment effects of polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid and adoptive transfer of serum samples containing anti-MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein antibodies in accelerating virus clearance from the lungs were demonstrated [37] . However, the infection was relatively mild and confined to the respiratory tract. The DPP4-transgenic mouse model with more severe pulmonary and disseminated extrapulmonary disease was definitely better, but it was still not a nonhuman primate model [38] . Recently, the common marmoset model, which mimicked severe, disseminated MERS-CoV human infection, was established [23] . This is the first study to report on the use of this new nonhuman primate model for evaluating the treatment effects of repurposed drugs for MERS. Consistent with the findings in the original description of the common marmoset model for MERS, the untreated animals in our study developed severe disease after MERS-CoV inoculation [23] . Comparatively, our untreated animals developed symptoms and died slightly earlier than those described in Falzarano's report [23] . This might be related to the different ages of the animals (our study, 3 years; Falzarano's study, 2-6 years) and routes of virus inoculation. Instead of combined intranasal (8 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 ), intratracheal (2 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 ), conjunctival (4 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 ), and oral (2 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 ) inoculation (total inoculum: 5.2 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 ), we used intratracheal inoculation (5 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 ), which likely resulted in more direct delivery of the virus to the lower respiratory tract with faster disease onset. Nonetheless, the overall clinical, radiological, pathological, and virological findings of our untreated animals were otherwise similar to those described previously and mimicked severe MERS in humans.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 167, "end": 170, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 997, "end": 1000, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1001, "end": 1004, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1005, "end": 1009, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1014, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1019, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1229, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1476, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1729, "end": 1733, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1855, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2188, "end": 2192, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2320, "end": 2324, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "We have previously demonstrated the potent in vitro anti-MERS-CoV activity of MMF [15] .

MERS-CoV is 50-100 times more sensitive to pegylated interferon-\u03b1 than SARS-CoV in vitro [46] . Therefore, treatment of MERS with interferons was considered and evaluated in vitro and in a small number of patients. In Vero/Vero6 cells, interferon-\u03b21b (Betaferon) exhibited a lower EC 50 :Cmax ratio than interferon-\u03b12a, -\u03b12b, and -\u03b21a [15, 47] . This might partially explain why the treatment effects of interferon-\u03b12a, -\u03b12b, and -\u03b21a on the survival rates of a small cohort of MERS patients were not obvious [22, [48] [49] [50] . In this study, we showed that MERS-CoV-infected common marmosets treated with interferon-\u03b21b had less severe disease and lower mean viral loads in necropsied lung and extrapulmonary tissues compared with untreated animals. Notably, as the lesions in the lopinavir/ritonavir-treated and interferon-\u03b21btreated animals were confined to 1-2 lobes, the overall mean viral load difference between these animals and the untreated animals were likely underestimated. Interferon-\u03b21b is commonly used to treat patients with multiple sclerosis and is usually well tolerated [32] . Rarely, monocloncal gammopathy patients treated with interferon-\u03b21b may develop systemic capillary leak syndrome [32] .

The in vivo anti-MERS-CoV effects and the lack of drug interactions between lopinavir/ ritonavir and interferon-\u03b21b make this an attractive combination in future clinical trials. In contrast, it is still uncertain if the combination of interferon-\u03b21b and/or lopinavir/ritonavir with a lower dose of MMF may provide better viral load suppression to overcome the deleterious effects of the latter drug. Notably, the combination of MMF and interferon-\u03b21b showed synergistic effects in MERS-CoV inhibition in vitro [15] . If this combination is shown to be effective in common marmosets, it may become an alternative treatment option in patients who are intolerant to interferon-\u03b21b and/or lopinavir/ritonavir. Other potentially effective treatment regimens such as the combination of ribavirin with interferon-\u03b21b and/or lopinavir/ritonavir should also be evaluated in the common marmoset model. Although the use of high-dose ribavirin is limited by its severe side effects, low-dose ribavirin combined with interferon-\u03b21b and/ or lopinavir/ritonavir may be synergistic and should still be considered. Finally, the shorter median time interval between symptom onset and death in MERS than in SARS patients emphasizes the importance of early use of these antiviral combinations in MERS. This is because MERS-CoV not only dampens the host innate interferon response, but also effectively suppresses the adaptive immune response by infection of CD3 + lymphocytes and induction of apoptosis via the both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in a high percentage of peripheral blood and splenic lymphocytes [26] . Failure to control MERS-CoV replication during the early phase of disease may therefore lead to an impaired adaptive immune response with poor outcome.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 856, "end": 860, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1940, "end": 1944, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Supplementary materials are available at The Journal of Infectious Diseases online (http://jid.oxfordjournals.org).
