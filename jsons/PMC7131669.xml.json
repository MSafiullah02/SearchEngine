            "text": "Throughout history, humankind has repeatedly fallen victim to dreadful epidemics or pandemics that have claimed the lives of millions over the centuries; from the \u2018plague of Justininan\u2019 dating back to the Roman empire, via \u2018the Black death\u2019 in the Middle Ages, to the \u2018Spanish flu\u2019 in 1918, the \u2018Asian flu\u2019 of 1957 and the \u2018Hong Kong flu\u2019 of 1968 (Zanetti and Zappa, 2010). By the 1970s it had become common to believe that infectious diseases were declining and would be soon eliminated through medical progress. This optimistic view appears to have been na\u00efve. In recent decades the world has been confronted with an ever-increasing number of novel or re-emerging infectious diseases, some of them causing true pandemics. Striking examples were the emergence of Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in the early 1980s and the more recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 (Zanetti and Zappa, 2010). It has been widely accepted in modern science that new viral strains will emerge and continue to pose challenges to public health and the scientific communities of future societies (Cohen, 2000, Medina and Garcia-Sastre, 2011, Sassetti and Rubin, 2007).",

In his \u2018Immunology of Spheres\u2019, Sloterdijk uses immunological concepts to analyse and assess the current biopolitical situation. He draws a parallel between the immune system on the biological level and immune systems on socio-political and cultural level. By building on this analogy between the biological immune system and \u201cimmune responses\u201d on socio-political level, this article shows how an immunological framework can be fruitful for grasping (assessing and reconceptualising) biosecurity. This mode of inquiry into problematisations of biosecurity is that of a second-order observer (Rabinow) (Collier and Lakoff, 2008, p.12). The analysis will be illustrated with quotations from Nature and Science articles (News and Opinion articles & Editorials) that deal with these two threats. The \u2018Sloterdijkean\u2019 analysis will be supplemented with the views of the American cultural critic Susan Sontag (1933\u20132004), notably her notion of apocalyptic discourse as reflected in her commentary on the AIDS pandemic in the late 1980s (notably in AIDS and its Metaphors, 1988).",

Biosecurity measures sometimes risk evolving into \u201cautoimmune\u201d responses. Autoimmunity is a biological concept that refers to an immune response directed against a body's own cells and tissues. In its metaphorical use as diagnostic tool, autoimmunity refers to a situation in which the protective measurements are more destructive than the original threats themselves and immunisation becomes a major threat to social (political) life itself. In the final part, it is shown how a One-Health approach could mitigate and act as counter-measure against the tendency towards \u201cautoimmune\u201d responses (whether caused by virological research, industrial animal agriculture or other institution). It will be shown how on the biological level the immune system does not simply operate as \u2018defence army\u2019 against all possible intruders of the body. Whether a virus or a microbe is \u2018seen\u2019 as something that must be attacked and destroyed is very depended upon the context in which the immune reaction takes place. Immunological processes like tolerance (\u2018silence\u2019 of the immune system upon encounter of a pathogen) and autoimmunity have proven that the immune system is far more complicate than a protective army against destructive invaders (Tauber, 2008, p.272). In this article, it is defended that such biomedical insights on the functioning of the immune system enable to assess and reconceptualise biosecurity.",

Human life has always been lived within what he calls protective \u2018immunising spheres\u2019 (Sloterdijk, 1998). For Sloterdijk, culture as such revolves around a process of immunisation (Sloterdijk, 1998, Sloterdijk, 2001, p.346). Spheres are spatial environments that function as protective immune systems. They defend us from looming threats coming from outside and create an ambiance, a place that humans can inhabit and that allows them to live their life in the immensity of the world. Humans are beings that have built and build caves, houses, villages, cities, nation-states, cultures, world-views etc., which act as immune systems or immune responses against possible threats from the outside world. This capacity to build protective spheres is not restricted to material environments such as villages, cities and, eventually, the metropolises of today, but it also involves protective ideological and symbolical structures such as metaphysical and religious views.",

            "text": "Sloterdijk argues that with the development of science and technology, formerly implicit aspects of the world (such as viruses) have become increasingly explicit. Sloterdijk's notion of \u2018explication\u2019 is akin to Heidegger's notions of \u2018unveiling\u2019 [Entbergung], which for both of them constitutes the core of science and technology. Sloterdijk refers to the 20th century as the \u201cage of explication\u201d [Explikationszeitalter] (Sloterdijk, 2004, p.228). In this century, science and technology have developed rapidly. From the time of Pasteur and Koch onwards, for example, human beings suddenly had to take explicit measures to protect themselves against the thus far unknown microbes. Sloterdijk shows how new knowledge also results in the corollary explication (and thus perception) of new risks and threats. Indeed, in Sloterdijk's view, \u2018immunisation\u2019 (as cultural phenomenon, including its biomedical forms) has nowadays become a focus of concern, due to forces of globalisation. This is illustrated by a profound desire for protection by means of insurances, security measures, vaccines, and so on. However, these \u2018immunisation\u2019 measures simultaneously (and paradoxically) entail a growing sense of more and deeper insecurity, which, in its turn, entails more and more emphasis on immunisation and so on. In the following, Sloterdijk's immunological framework will be operationalised. The Sloterdijkean concepts of \u2018immunisation\u2019 and \u2018explication\u2019 of Sloterdijk will be applied as diagnostic tool to analyse and problematise the biosecurity measures taken in response to successively the Swine flu pandemic and the Avian flu threat. However, this article extends Sloterdijk's immunological framework. It also employs other immunological concepts, such as the notion of autoimmunity. By drawing a more complete and precise parallel between the functioning of the biological immune system and \u201cimmune responses\u201d on socio-political level some contemporary biosecurity measures are further assessed and problematised. In the third part, it is shown how a One-Health approach could \u2018cure\u2019 some of the \u2018pains\u2019 (i.e. \u201cautoimmune\u201d responses) of contemporary biosecurity.",

As it turned out, the surface proteins of the virus were strikingly similar to those of the 1918 Spanish flu virus that had caused a pandemic 90 years earlier. It then killed up to 50 million people worldwide (Nabel et al., 2011). Accordingly, in several scientific articles the severity of the threat (and the \u2018immunisation measures\u2019 considered necessary) was stressed by referring to the dreadfulness of this 1918 pandemic of the Spanish flu (Barry, 2009). Following the threat and these premonitions, an \u201cimmunisation response\u201d erupted, not only on the biomedical scene (development and distribution of vaccines and antiviral medicines) but also at the societal level (public health measures; surveillance, quarantine, hygiene, etc.).",

            "text": "On the one hand, virology in general enables the emergence of an effective biological immunisation response, such as in the H1N1 case. Virological research has revealed the genetic characteristics of H1N1, its transmissibility, etc. in order to make informed decisions on how to control and counteract the virus's spread (Hayden, 2009). On the other hand, virological research obviously increases our knowledge about viruses, about their genes, their virulence, their interaction with hosts, and their spread. This progressive understanding has also made us more aware of the potential new risks we are exposed to. This ambivalent effect of virological research is captured nicely by the following quote from Nature: \u201cThe boost in research spending on epidemiological modelling and laboratory studies has enabled scientists to understand the H1N1 virus in record time, prepare to manufacture vaccine faster, make more informed decisions on how to intervene in the virus's spread, and understand and share information on its genetic characteristics\u201d (Hayden, 2009, p.756). In this phrase, it is suggested that our increased knowledge will boost our immunisation response. In the following quote, however, the basic ambivalence already becomes more apparent: \u201cIf researchers know the key genetic regions that facilitate reassortment, surveillance efforts could watch out for H5N1 of H1N1 viruses with changes in those regions, ones that might be on the verge of dangerous reassortments\u201d (Maher and Butler, 2009, p.157). In other words, increased knowledge about the Swine flu genes might result in the discovery of an even more dangerous and virulent \u2018reassortment\u2019 of the virus. Reassortment, or gene mixing, refers to the exchange of segments of the viral genome of two distinct virus strains as a result of simultaneous infection of a single cell by two distinct influenza viruses. This can result in the generation of a novel influenza virus strain, and it is believed that most human pandemic viruses actually arose in this way (Medina and Garcia-Sastre, 2011).",

This new disconcerting knowledge involves what Sloterdijk refers to as \u2018collateral damage\u2019 (Sloterdijk, 2004, p.200). If new diseases or new viral strains are discovered, the feelings of security or comfort (among both experts and the public) will not increase. The opposite is actually more true, there is an increase of uneasiness or distrust because of the increased awareness of new potential risks in society (Sloterdijk, 2004, p.198\u2013201). This is a paradigmatic example of what could be termed the \u2018immunisation paradox\u2019, the idea that \u201cimmunisation measures\u201d result in the concomitant \u2018explication\u2019 of previously unknown risks and threats and feelings of insecurity, which entail more and more emphasis on immunisation.",

First of all, increase in our knowledge about the Swine flu unravels potential new risks, for example the risk of dangerous reassortments or mutants of the virus that makes it more virulent, transmissible or resistant to drugs (Maher and Butler, 2009). Secondly, new knowledge about viruses and new techniques, for example the technique of \u2018resurrecting\u2019 former (now extinct) viruses such as the 1918 flu virus, actually creates new forms of risk associated with the technology itself. Although a fully reconstructed virus might gain a better understanding of the virus and thus be instrumental in fighting the next pandemic, there is nonetheless a risk of accidental or intentional release (bioterrorism) of the virus from the lab (Beck, 2002, Bubnoff, 2005, Interlandi, 2010). The paradoxical implications of this so-called \u2018pre-emptive\u2019 strategy will be further discussed later in the manuscript.",

The immediate cause for this evaluation report was a motion tabled under the title \u201cFaked Pandemics \u2013 a Threat for Health,\u201d by Dr Wolfgang Wodarg (2009). Although the intention was to write a clear-cut evaluation of the topic, the document abounds in ambiguities.

He warns for an imminent pandemic of a viral (flu) strain. The exact moment it will strike is yet uncertain but the fact that a pandemic will strike sooner or later is something to be expected (Osterhaus, 2010). Many virologists such as Osterhaus justify their warnings against a pandemic by saying that we always should \u2018expect the unexpected\u2019 (Butler, 2009, p.21; Weiss and McMichael, 2004, p.S75; Howard and Fletcher, 2012, p.10). This rhetoric is comparable to the rhetoric on AIDS described by Susan Sontag in AIDS and its Metaphors (1988), which seems to be aimed at accustoming us with \u201cthe intermittent awareness of a monstrous, unthinkable \u2013 but we are told quite probable \u2013 pandemic catastrophe\u201d (Sontag, 1988 p.88). Such taste for worst-case scenarios seems to reflect the constant need to master fear of what is felt to be out of control (1988, p.87). The warning \u2018expect the unexpected\u2019 entails a situation in which constant fear is provoked, rather than fear of a specific disease at a specific moment; as such, it produces a kind of sustained state of fear. Sontag (1988) has argued how it seems that in modern society, the end is believed to be near, but this is a \u201clong-running serial\u201d, a protracted condition rather than a terminal event. It is a state that always looms but never happens (Sontag, 1988, p.88; see also Fitzpatrick, 2003, p.1310). As she puts it, it is not \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d but rather \u201cApocalypse from now on\u201d (Sontag, 1988 p.88). It seems that virologists who warn for the looming threat of viruses and pandemics try to make the pandemic catastrophe a key element of our \u201cordinary horizon of expectations\u201d. In contemporary society, the state of concern has become interminable (Cooper, 2008a, Cooper, 2008b, Fitzpatrick, 2003), which can be regarded \u201can autoimmune pathology\u201d, or as Sontag puts it: \u201can unparallelled violence that is being done to our sense of reality, to our humanity\u201d (Sontag, 1988 p.88).",

            "text": "These concerns for a looming viral threat are closely connected with key characteristics of viruses, such as their invisibility to the naked eye, their capacity to mutate and evolve very quickly. Viral infections are particularly difficult to eradicate because viruses adapt continuously to their environment by mutation, recombination or gene reassortment (Morens et al., 2004). Furthermore, globalisation promotes the emergence and spread of new infections and pandemics (Zanetti and Zappa, 2010). Accordingly, virologists state that \u201cyet at the end of the day, making predictions about this new H1N1's next move is a mug's game. There's nothing more predictable about flu than its unpredictability\u201d (Cohen, 2009a, p.997). When, where and how the next catastrophe will strike remains uncertain, disaster is always incubating and one can only speculate (Ewald, 2001). Accordingly, the inescapable elusive and uncertain characteristics of viral threats call for drastic and immediate \u201cimmunisation measures\u201d. Some virologists argue that H2N2 looms and could re-emerge in a similar way as H1N1 did. Accordingly, they urge for a \u201cpre-emptive\u201d vaccination strategy against this potential threat (Nabel et al., 2011, St\u00f6hr, 2010). Yet, such pre-emptive strategies are likely to generate their own incalculable dangers and incorporate autoimmunitary aspects, as will be shown in the next section.",

However, in the course of time the doctrine of pre-emption has changed, mainly in response to the World Trace Center (WTC) attacks of 9/11/2001 (National Security Strategy, 2002). In Life as Surplus (2008), Cooper points out that what is radically new about this doctrine is that the US authorised itself to use pre-emptive action against a threat that is not so much imminent as emergent; \u201ca threat whose actual occurrence remains irreducibly speculative, impossible to locate or predict\u201d (Cooper, 2008a, Cooper, 2008b, p.124). In recent decades, newly emerging infectious diseases, but also bioterrorist threats, such as the anthrax attacks of 2002, induced a shift in the approach to disease from classic public health (managing known diseases) to preparedness practices (developing the capacity to respond to yet unknown potentially catastrophic biological events (Lakoff, 2008; pp.14, 33\u201360)).",

In view of a potential future Avian flu pandemic, two groups of scientists (one led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka at the University of Tokyo and the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, and one led by Ron Fouchier of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands), have created mutant H5N1 Avian influenza variants that can be transmitted between ferrets, which are a good proxy for how flu behaves in other mammals, including humans (Herfst et al., 2012, Imai et al., 2012). To date, however, H5N1 viruses have very scarcely been transmitted between humans. Nevertheless, as H5N1 viruses continue to evolve and infect humans, the viral experts concerned warn for the fact that variants of H5N1 viruses with pandemic potential, including Avian\u2013human reassortant viruses, might emerge (Kawaoka, 2012). In this specific case, the doctrine of pre-emption implies that we need not only to mobilise against currently circulating viruses, but against a potential emergence of a possible disease, in this case a transmissible mutant version of the Avian flu, which (as far as one knows) does not exist yet. This could be regarded as a form of \u2018anticipatory evolution\u2019 (Bacher et al., 2002).",

Fouchier, author of one of the mutant flu papers, argues similarly that publication of his study could help stop a future pandemic, whether natural or as a result of an act of terrorism (Hunter, 2012). Accordingly, imposing censorship on publication would be counterproductive, to the extent that it constrains the development of suitable countermeasures such as vaccines (Hunter, 2012).",

There is an increased demand for public health preparedness to focus not only on interventions against known recorded viral strains but on generic measures that would be effective against yet unknown, not recorded but theoretically possible viral strains (Collier and Lakoff, 2008, p.12\u201316). The idea behind pre-emption is to intervene in the conditions of emergence of the future, before one may be besieged by nature's own act of emergence (Cooper, 2008a, Cooper, 2008b, p.91). In the case of the mutant Avian flu, virologists make use of exactly that argument. Professor John Oxford from Barts and the London School of Medicine says, \u201cThe biggest risk with bird flu is from the virus itself. We should forget about bio terrorism and concentrate on Mother Nature\u201d (Walsh, 2011, p.1). In similar vein, Osterhaus argues that the bigger danger is that \u201cnature will do the first job\u201d (quoted from Check, 2005, p.406). Similarly, Fouchier and De Jong (virologists) claim that \u201cnature is the biggest terrorist\u201d (Carvajal, 2011, p.A28; Visser, 2012, p.1). Their argument clearly states that virologists should be allowed to pre-emptively \u2018attack\u2019 nature, before nature itself will \u2018attack\u2019 us.",

This means that the rapid technological and scientific developments within the life sciences, and our deepened understanding of biological life at the molecular level, have resulted in the fact that human existence (at the biological level) has increasingly become the dominant concern of government attention. The idea of \u2018pre-emptive war\u2019 against all possible offenders, including terrorists as well as viruses, seems to be the quintessential result of this development. Esposito regards this to be the \u201cautoimmune illness\u201d of contemporary political culture, by pointing to the paradoxical results of this strategy and by indicating that this \u2018excessive defense\u2019 actually ruins the body politic it is meant to protect (Esposito, 2008, p.147\u2013148).",

Medical technology can also pose a risk and unintentionally introduce and spread infectious diseases. Drug-resistant microbes, contaminated equipment or biological medicines produced from animal-cell substrates can also present an inherent potential for introducing new infections (Weiss and McMichael, 2004). All these factors cause patterns of infectious diseases to change globally and on a massive scale. This illustrates how human health obviously cannot be separated from planetary conditions in general, i.e. from our total planetary \u2018health\u2019, including the health status of its animate and inanimate environment (see also, Canguilhem, 1989). We live in interdependent existence with the totality of the living and non-living world. Accordingly, today we understand that the concept of the microbe as the single cause of infection (as Koch has postulated) is inadequate and incomplete, because it ignores the influence of the host, the milieu, and the social and physical environment (Budd et al., 2009, Weiss and McMichael, 2004, Wilson, 1995). Next to all fundamental viral research, we should pay at least as much attention to the ecological and climatological factors such as increased global population, increased travel, intensive animal farming and food production, global climate change, prophylactic doses of antibiotics and other drugs, and so on (Rappuoli, 2004).",

            "text": "In immunology, a similar development towards more attention for the context (of immune responses) can be traced. In the 19th century, immunology began as a study on how a host organism reacts to pathogenic injury and how it defends itself against microbial incursion (Tauber, 1999, p.459). In that pathological context, immunology came to be defined as the science that discriminates between self and non-self (other) (Tauber, 1994). In recent decades, processes such as immunological tolerance (\u2018silence\u2019 of the immune system upon the encounter of a pathogen) and autoimmunity have pointed immunologists to the fact that the immune system is far more complex than simply a \u2018defence army\u2019 against destructive invaders (Tauber, 2008, p.272). It appeared that the immune system does not attack and destroy all invading pathogens, but includes a more nuanced and diverse repertoire. Immunologists increasingly recognise the importance of the \u2018context\u2019 of immune reactivity (Tauber, 2008, Tauber, 2012). Whether a virus or microbe is \u2018seen\u2019 as \u2018enemy\u2019 is dependent upon the context in which the immune reaction takes place. It appears that an antigen (that which elicits an immune response) is not a priori \u2018non-self\u2019 or the \u2018enemy\u2019, but only attains its \u2018meaning\u2019 within a particular context. In other words, immune responses are not based on intrinsic foreignness, but rather on how the immune system perceives an antigen (of the virus) in the larger context of the body's economy (Tauber, 2000, p.241). The immune system is thus in constant \u2018dialogue\u2019 with surrounding tissues and the exterior. In that way, the immune system determines what is to be protected and healed and what is foreign, and thus must be attacked and destroyed (Tauber, 2000, Tauber, 2008).",

Parallel to the immune system, which appears to be far more complex and nuanced than a destructive army, the \u201cimmune responses\u201d involved in biosecurity should be more nuanced and complex and take into account the context in which they take place. \u201cImmunisation measures\u201d that do not take into account the context in which they are applied do not only risk developing into \u201cautoimmune\u201d responses but they are also less effective (Bingham and Hinchliff, 2008, p.174\u2013193).

It has been argued how viral research potentially brings about \u2018collateral damage\u2019, through the explication of formerly unknown risks, for example the emergence of a more virulent reassortment of the virus. Given important characteristics of viruses such as their invisibility, their unpredictability, and their capacity to mutate quickly, virologists are bound to caution that despite immunisation measures, viral threats are always looming. This further promotes the shift to preparedness in public health, including a practice of pre-emption. The lab-bred mutant Avian flu is a paradigmatic example thereof. However, such strong defensive (and preventive) \u201cimmunisation measures\u201d risk evolving into \u201cautoimmune\u201d responses. In the context of this article, \u201cautoimmune\u201d responses involve a situation in which protective measures (against a viral threat) are more destructive for society than the original viral threat itself.",

If pre-emption develops into a standard doctrine, one needs to take into account the evolution rate and reassortment possibilities of this most abundant type of biological entity and the accordingly endless range of potential viral threats. The \u201cautoimmune\u201d aspects of the lab-bred Avian flu involve not only the creation of new viruses, but also psychological damage by creating a permanent state of fear. More importantly, as long as virologists regard \u2018nature as the biggest bioterrorist\u2019, the worrisome entanglement between the protection of biological life (immunisation) and war including its \u201cautoimmunitary\u201d effects will be furthered rather than contested.",

From the perspective of One-Health, the \u2018other\u2019 whether a virus or anything else is not a priori the enemy that has to be \u2018fought\u2019 and \u2018defeated\u2019. The biological immune system does not simply operate as \u2018defence army\u2019 but mediates aggressive as well as cooperative (tolerant) interactions (Tauber, 2008). More importantly, whether a virus or microbe is \u2018seen\u2019 as \u2018enemy\u2019 is dependent upon the context in which the immune reaction takes place. It appears that an antigen (that which elicits an immune response) is not a priori \u2018other\u2019 or the \u2018enemy\u2019, but only attains its \u2018meaning\u2019 within a particular context. In other words, immune responses are not based on intrinsic foreignness, but rather on how the immune system perceives an antigen (of the virus) in the larger context of the body's economy (Tauber, 2000, p.241). Analogously, the \u201cimmune systems\u201d on socio-political level involved in biosecurity should also include a broader and more nuanced \u201cimmunological repertoire\u201d. On the socio-political level not all viruses need to be (pre-emptively) \u2018fought\u2019. A One-Health approach that involves such attention for the context in which (socio-political) immune reactions take place is needed.",
