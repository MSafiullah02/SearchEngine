In addition to the health care costs incurred by sick patients needing outpatient care and hospitalization, the societal costs of lost productivity and ancillary costs are substantial. When children become ill, parents take time off from work to care for them and take them for treatment. Ill employees are absent from work, and even when present in the workplace, their productivity can be substantially reduced, while increasing the risk of transmission to coworkers. Retirees suffer some of the most severe complications of influenza and may require more assistance from family members and informal caregivers resulting in societal costs that exceed the usual medical expenditures.",

These include vaccine effectiveness estimates from 25% to 85% (higher efficacy improves cost-effectiveness), attack rates from 13% to 40% (higher attack rates improve cost-effectiveness), and vaccine coverage from 20% to 100% (variable results on cost-effectiveness), and vaccination program costs of $0\u2013$60 (higher vaccine costs decrease cost-effectiveness). The target age group for vaccination varied from day care center attendees, school children, and all children 6 months to 18 years. Some of the studies included only illness in those children in the target age group receiving the vaccine; others included secondary cases in families and general population averted resulting from childhood vaccination. In all studies, indirect benefits such as fewer days off from work for parents to care for sick children greatly exceeded the direct savings from the obviated medical expenses.",

The US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that all children (or preteens in the case of HPV) receive the vaccines listed in Table 3 plus an annual influenza vaccination. Canada recommends vaccination of the entire population annually. A few European countries recommend annual vaccination of children, despite the benefits demonstrated in this review, and only recommend vaccination for the elderly and those with chronic illness.
