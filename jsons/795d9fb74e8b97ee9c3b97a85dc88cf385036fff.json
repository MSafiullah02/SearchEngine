            "text": "26 Background: The SARS-CoV-2 virus emerged in December 2019 and caused a 27 pandemic associated with a spectrum of COVID-19 disease ranging from 28 asymptomatic to lethal infection. Serology testing is important for diagnosis of 29 infection, determining infection attack rates and immunity in the population. It also 30 informs vaccine development. Although several serology tests are in use, improving 31 their specificity and sensitivity for early diagnosis on the one hand and for detecting 32 past infection for population-based studies, are priorities. 33 Methods: We evaluated the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles to 15 SARS-CoV-2 34 antigens by cloning and expressing 15 open reading frames (ORFs) in mammalian 35 cells and screened antibody responses to them in COVID-19 patients using the 36 Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System (LIPS). 37 Results: The LIPS technique allowed us to detect antibody responses in COVID-19 38 patients to 11 of the 15 SARS-CoV-2 antigens tested, identifying novel immunogenic 39 targets. This technique shows that antigens ORF3b and ORF8 allow detection of 40 antibody early in infection in a specific manner and reveals the immuno-dominance of 41 the N antigen in COVID-19 patients. 42 Conclusion: Our report provides an unbiased characterization of antibody responses 43 to a range of SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The combination of 3 SARS-CoV-2 antibody 44 LIPS assays, i.e. N, ORF3b, and ORF8, is sufficient to identify all COVID-19 patients 45 of our cohort even at early time-points of illness, whilst Spike alone fails to do so. 46",
