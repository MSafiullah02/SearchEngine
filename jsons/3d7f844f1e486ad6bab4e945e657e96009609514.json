The investigators found that the shorter training course resulted in better performance of AED skills at the immediate post-instructional and 6 month testing episodes than did the standard length American Heart Association course. Most importantly, the investigators conjecture that the use of an AED is mostly a cognitive skill and that this would be amenable to video or internet training, resulting in better initial performance and a longer retention of skills as compared to the traditional instructor-led training course which emphasizes the psychomotor aspects of AED use. The implication from this is that cognitive training and device driven instructions are more important to initial and long term performance than psychomotor training when using a device such as an AED [Roppolo2007] .",

Another example used a very simple written instruction to direct untrained lay providers in providing only defibrillation during a simulated cardiac arrest. This was then followed by a 20 minute training event involving only the operation of an AED or manual defibrillator. On immediate retesting, the now-trained AED and manual defibrillator providers recorded excellent performance, but only the AED trained individuals retained sufficient operational skills at the 10 month reevaluation to be considered competent [Fromm1997] . A study utilizing cartoons to instruct 6-7 year-old children proved quite successful and was limited only by location, time and funding [Uray2003] . Two other studies utilized dispatcher-assisted CPR-AED with adequate performance of the AED using dispatcher verbal prompts [Harve2007] [Harve 2009 .

The comment was made that training that is more content and skills driven rather than being formally didactic and technical would transfer the educational content into actual practice better had the training been more individualized and congruent [Groh2007] . Regardless of training method, the use of the AED in an actual Sudden Cardiac Arrest event is the defining measure of training success. Traditional training of HCP and lay providers has shown excellent outcomes, but alternative training modalities have also been highly successful. So, regardless of the means of training, and in answer to the PICO, the overall outcome of survival from an SCA depends not on the method of training but on who, when, where and what type of device is present and whether it is used. The HCP and lay providers must be convinced that the AED is effective, trustworthy and should be used [Timmons2007] by whatever means available. Ultimately, that is the goal of training.",

(Reviewer's comments: A study based on device prompting of use with subject intervention of turning machine on, placement of pads and defibrillating mannequin. No comment on correlation to real arrest. Significant in the use of untrained and device innocent lay providers. An unanswered question is how much the most critical skill that was performed the most poorly, the placement of the defibrillator pads, would improve with training. This is partially addressed by the study when better placement of the pads occured as each tested subject moved to the next device. Direction of support or otherwise for the question asked, according to the specific outcomes that have been assessed: Neutral; small intervention with conventional instructor training according to established training protocols of the AHA and ARC. (Reviewer's comment: Interesting in that some involved school districts were constrained by lack of community support, fear or unwillingness to use the AED, and community reservations about the device. Legal liability and lack of understanding of the device were not barriers to implementation.)",

(Reviewer's comment: Small but important study; compared use of an AED versus blind manual defibrillation by untrained lay volunteers during a simulated SCA with CPR in progress. Their only duty was to defibrillate with one of the machines using an instruction sheet during the event, then followed by a twenty minute training session. Following this short training period, they were retested immediately and again at 10 months. The outcome of successful use of an AED remained strongly positive as compared to a manual defibrillator at the intial testing through training and retesting to 10 months. The authors suggest that use and training of lay providers, with and without BLS skills can be made with simple and very short training interventions, not necessarily instructor driven.)

(Reviewer's comments: the most important outcome of tis interview study is the authors' comment that the acquistion of practical skills seems to have overridden the need to prepare the providers for the feelings, attitudes and support they will need to initiate AED use and the aftermath of resuscitation effort, successful or not, implying that not addressing these issues would affect the performance of the provider. Direction of support or otherwise for the question asked, according to the specific outcomes that have been assessed: Opposed; dispatcher assistance for use of an AED and performance of CPR initially followed by formal CPR-AED training and retesting in 6 months with a result of improvement of breathing, but without a substantial improvement of CPR-AED delivery. Contrary to expectations, retention of AED skills did not improve with the training and retesting. (Reviewer's comments: The authors speculate the the lack of improvement in this study was possibly due to a lack of need or motivation to perform CPR and use an AED. They also speculate that training such a cadre of unselected participants is costly as compared to other health initiatives.) Conflict of Interest: There are not conflicts of interest declared by any author of this manuscript. Direction of support or otherwise for the question asked, according to the specific outcomes that have been assessed: Supportive; CPR performance was poor when dispatcher led but AED performance was judged reasonable with almost 2/3 of the tested teams defibrillating within 5 minutes of the onset of the cardiac arrest. Concurrent use of the AED did not compromise the performance of CPR. (Reviewer's comment: An important study finding that relatively motivated young males were unable to provide adequate CPR by dispatcher guidance, but were able to apply and use an AED with moderate success. No comment on retention is noted in the study)",

(Reviewer's commnets: This important study compares a computer based retraining of previously traditionally trained EMT-D's with an instructor led retraining encounter, finding equivalence of a video based encounter not utilizing any ancillary or real equipment to be equivlaent in both training and real-time experience.. Of interest is that the authors feel that the intial training must involve a \"hands-on, practical experience that duplicates the skills and actions required during real field resuscitations.\" Comment is made that they see few alternatives by manufacturers to simplify initial training or use of AEDs. This portends poorly for the largest user group, the lay bystander.) Conflict of Interest: The Center for Evaluation of Emergency Medical Services receives both categorical and noncategorical grant support from a number of sources, including foundations, several defibrillator manufacturers, and other companies that manufacture products for EMS use. No specific financial support was provided from any defibrillator manufacturer for this program or project Kelley J, Richman PB, Ewy GA, Clark L, Bulloch B, Bobrow BJ. Eighth grade students become proficient at CPR and use of an AED following a condensed training programme. Resuscitation2006;71(2):229-36. Direction of support or otherwise for the question asked, according to the specific outcomes that have been assessed: Supportive; alternative compressed course teaching psychomotor, kinesthetic skills with didactic knowledge to lay providers of teenagers. Authors considered the program a success. (Reviewer's comments: in the discussion, the authors gave detailed statistical data from Arizona of lay participation in a SCA, citing low numbers of events involving CPR and AED use. They note as some of the barriers a reluctance to perform mout-tomough breathing and fears of harming the victim. They note barriers to conventional CPR-AED training as cost, convenience and the need for voluntareer to present themselves. They make a plea for simplifyiung the training by not including extraneous information such as stroke, pediatric use, etc; instead concentrating on adult chest compression and AED use which is the intent of their one hour course.) Direction of support or otherwise for the question asked, according to the specific outcomes that have been assessed: Supportive; alternative training vs standardized training; similar outcomes initially, with equivalent three month performance with all showing equivalent skills degredation. The study utilized seniors with mannequin training. Both instructor and alternative training methods truncated at 45 minutes total. (Reviewer's comments: Most importantly, this moderately-sized, somewhat biased study found the most significantly persistent error to be poor placement of the pads at the second testing. The authors admit that their criteria were rigid and that the majority of pad placements would probably be effective. More difficult to explain is why 1/3 of the elders did not shock even when the device indicated a shock was needed. ) Conflict of Interest: Supported by a grant from the Medic One Foundation and by unrestricted research contributions from the Asmund S.

Both groups tested only at 6 months. The AED training was instructor driven and did not allow physical use of the AED during the short course. Retention of AED skills at 6 months actually higher than with traditional training --the authors conjecture that operating an AED is mostly a congnitive rather than a psychomotor skill, accounting for the better initial performance and retention as versus the standard course that emphasizes the psychomotor skills of handling the device. They further conjecture that video training and use of the internet may be viable options to learn the cognitive skills necessary for AED use and retention. They also point out that following three instructions to identify the problem, activate or open the device and follow the instructions are the only necessary steps to operation of the device. This implies that instruction that is cognitive and machine based has better outcomes and retention than psychomotor manipulation of a particular device.

Most significant was the author's findings that meeting the instructors face-to-face imparted a sense of trust, expertise, and integrity to the trainees. (Reviewer's comments: This interview article points out that trusting the device and the trainers was the most important interaction that convinced lay providers to use the device in the future, although they had not use it in an actual event to the time of the interview.

Interestingly, 56% of those tested pre-course successfully used the AED without training. (Reviewer's comments: because of the ease of use of the current devices and the fact that 56% of untrained lay providers successfully used the device without training, the authors suggest that \"complex and time-consuming training programmes may not be necessary\" and that a better use of training encounters would be to assist the lay provider in performing during the arrest scenario than in learning a skills-intensive intervention. They also propose frequent training and mention recertification base on the noted deterioration of speed and quality of CPR.)

With current technology, this would include visual prompts by the device as well as those imprinted on the pads [Eames2003][Fromm1997], and require only the single human intervention of properly applying the pads to the suspected victim without any further human intervention [Beckers 2005][Beckers 2007]",

Numerous other small studies have shown that AED use under real time events can be successfully accomplished by both HCPs and lay providers [deVries2004][England2005] with little or no prior training and that their performance improved with subsequent traditional or non-traditional retraining [Jerin1998]. In summary, for lay and healthcare BLS providers requiring AED training, the simpler the better [Beckers 2005][Beckers2007][Eames2003][Fromm1997][Kelley2006][Roppolo2007] both for initial performance and skills retention [Wik2003]. Because of the cognitive nature of AED training [Roppolo2007] and the guidance provided by the device itself [Beckers2005][Beckers2007] [Castren2004] [Fromm1997] [Monsieurs2005], the only significant effect of instructor intervention was in the placement of the pads [Nurmi2005][Woolard2006] and the encouragement given to the providers to actually use the device [Timmons2007][Uray2003]. Also, concurrent CPR training might have mitigated the effectiveness of AED training and consideration should then be given to separating them as AED training alone resulted in better skills retention as compared to that achieved with concurrent CPR-AED training [Cummins 1985][Harve2007][Rittenberger2006]. Alternative methods of AED training offered an opportunity for comparable outcomes at a considerably lower cost to the individual provider, the sponsoring institution and the healthcare environment as a whole [Andresen2008][Beckers2005][Beckers2007] [Castren2004][deVries2008][Kelly2006][Meischke2001][Reder2006][Wik2003][Woolard 2006]. Several studies [Fromm1997][Groh2007] have shown that simple instructions resulted in excellent AED provider performance and skills retention [Kelley2006][Roppolo2007] whereas standardized instructor driven courses better served the AED providers when they addressed their individual backgrounds, work environment and other personal needs [Harrison-Paul2006][Riegel2006][Warwick1995].",
