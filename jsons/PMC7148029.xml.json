There are roughly ten sessions per user, where each session is usually a set of reformulations. Such collections with just a couple of queries per user are inadequate for driving research in privacy, especially research that focuses on topical profiling. The 2014 Yandex collection [15] is useful for evaluating personalization algorithms. However, to protect the privacy of Yandex users, every query term is replaced by a numeric ID. This anonymization strategy makes semantic interpretation impossible and may be a reason why this collection has not received widespread adoption in privacy studies. Interpretability of log contents is vital for understanding privacy threats [5, 6, 8].",

Queries in the synthetic log were derived from users\u2019 information needs posed as natural language questions. A collection like this has three advantages. First, it enables creation of rich user profiles by stitching queries derived from questions asked by the same user across different topical forums. Second, since it is derived from explicitly public resources created by users under the StackExchange terms of service (allowing reuse of data for research purposes), it escapes the ethical pitfalls intrinsic to dissemination of private user data. Third, CQA forums contain questions and assessments of relevance in the form of accepted answers from the same user, which is vital for the correct interpretation of query intent [2, 9]. Other signals like similar queries and reformulations can also be simulated with related questions and duplicates, available on most CQA forums.",

An accurate approach like this would enable the creation of high-quality search collections down the road. We make the following contributions: (1) We conduct a large-scale user study where crowdworkers convert questions to queries, controlling for several biases; (2) We provide insights from the collected data that could drive strategies for automatic conversion at scale and be used to derive synthetic search collections for privacy studies; (3) We release 7, 000 question-query pairs collected from the study3.",

In addition to such algorithmic conversion, potential future directions include an analysis of the quality of crowdsourced queries [12] for our setup (such as their potential for retrieval), as well as applying our general methodology to other CQA datasets [11].",
