After the incubation period, a proportion i of COVID-19 cases exhibit severe/critical infection ( C ) and the remaining fraction experience midler symptoms ( I ). We assume that the average duration of the infectious period is the same for both mild and severe/critical cases, with the infectious period lasting 1/ days. For individuals experiencing severe/critical illness, we assume that their symptoms are severe enough that after 1/ days they will reside in their home for the remaining part of their infectious period. For the average time from onset to staying at home (1/ ), we use one day which is the time from symptom onset to fever 2 . Since we assumed the duration of the infectious period was the same for all severities of infection, the average time a severely ill COVID-19 case spends at home is 1/ -1/ days, which corresponds to a rate of /( -).",
