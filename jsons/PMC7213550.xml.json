With ten genome sequences done of the COVID-19, it was found out that it was closely related (88%) to two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. It is to be noted that the results showed that COVID-19 is quite distinct from its previously sporadic versions, SARS-CoV (79%) and MERS-CoV (50%) (Lu et al. 2020). These data point towards the possible suggestion of the bat being the original host while the animals in the wet markets of Wuhan proved to be the intermediate hosts (Lu et al. 2020).",

This is followed by entry into the cell, which is accomplished by acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of S protein followed by the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. As the virus enters the cytoplasm of the cell, the translation of the replicase gene from the virion genomic RNA takes place. RNA synthesis follows its translation and assembly. This includes the translation of the S, E, and M structural proteins (Fehr and Perlman 2015). Following the interaction of M protein binding to the nucleocapsid in the endoplasmic reticulum, virion assembly is complete. This completed form then leaves the cell to continue its spread (Fehr and Perlman 2015).",

The incubation period is between 3 and 7 days and up to 2 weeks. The R0 is 2.2, meaning each patient will infect two other uninfected people. Such studies suggest that sneezing and coughing by a carrier of the virus can spread the virus, and people are more susceptible to getting infected in closed spaces with inadequate ventilation (Cascella et al. 2020; van Doremalen et al. 2020).",

Wuhan has been in lockdown since the mid of January but with no new cases reported for the week leading up to March 24, the government planned on lifting the lockdown from April 8th (Bloomberg 2020). China on January 23rd, stopped air and rail travel while restricting car transport in Wuhan. Large gatherings were banned with residents asked to stay in home. These also include, the cancellation of the 2020 Olympics Games in Tokyo, postponement of many sports events etc. Educational institutions, business of all sorts, government departments, etc. were closed.
