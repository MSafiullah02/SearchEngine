We analyze the dynamics of this system, compute the reproduction numbers, and use the data from the Cuban HIV/AIDS epidemic between 1986-2008 to fit the model. We obtain estimates for the detection-related parameters during two separate time periods to reflect the timeline of the implementation of various types of searches. The reproduction numbers for each time period are also computed from the sets of values of the parameters. We found that random screening is most important as a mean of surveillance. Moreover, local asymptotic stability for the Disease Free Equilibrium can be achieved if (i) random screening is sufficiently effective and (ii) infection by detected HIV-positive individuals is minimal. Our results highlight the importance of education for the known infectious for the purpose of preventing further infection. Fitting the 1986-2008 HIV data to obtain the model parameter estimates indicates that the HIV epidemic in Cuba is currently approaching an endemic equilibrium. A Genetic Algorithm is used.",

From 2000 and up to September 2008, the family doctors were responsible for the detection of 31.7% of the new cases while contact tracing detected 20.4% of the new cases. From this information we can deduce that the detection system is not static in terms of the contribution to the detection of new HIV cases. Before 1999 the most important contribution was from the contact tracing and partner notification program, while after 1999 the family doctors play a dominant role in the detection system. We will focus on modeling this change in the detection system by dividing the time period into two periods and introducing model parameters that will differentiate the detection by the family doctors from contact tracing and other (random) searches.",

A summary of their respective roles in the asymptotic state of the system is given in Table 1 . Previous modeling studies of HIV with secondary reproduction numbers includes [5] , [6] and [8] . The biological interpretations of these parameters is the following. R 0 gives the number of infections by an infective who is detected via random screening; R 1 is the number of infections caused by an infective after he/she has been tested positive for HIV; and R 2 is the number of infections caused by an infective that is not detected during asymptomatic period, i.e., if an infective either develops AIDS-related illness or pass away before progression to AIDS. We note that R 0 can be considered as the basic reproduction number, if we do not consider the detection of HIV-positive individuals in Cuba as part of disease surveillance instead of an intervention measure, especially in light of the realistic model assumption that those detected to be HIV-positive can still infected others, albeit at a lower level, before the onset of AIDS-defined illnesses [2] . Moreover, R 0 determines whether the DFE (P 0 ) is locally asymptotically stable, as is the typical role of a basic reproduction number. R 1 and R 2 are secondary reproduction numbers, which help us determine the asymptotic behavior of the system, often relating to the endemic equilibrium. In the present model, whether R 1 is larger than unity determines the existence of an unstable endemic equilibrium P * when R 0 < 1. When R 0 > 1, R 1 < 1 in combination with R 2 > 1 ensure the existence of a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium P * . Serving as threshold parameters for the model system, these reproduction numbers have an obvious and epidemiologically meaningful interpretation. For the proposed model of detection and surveillance of HIV epidemic in Cuba, our results indicate that random screening is most important as a mean of surveillance, since the number of infections due to an infective detected through random determines whether the DFE is (locally) asymptotically stable. In other words, if the averaged total number of infections by an infective detected through random screening exceeds one, then there will always be an epidemic.",

This is true even when R 0 < 1, provided that the initial population sizes are outside the domain of attraction of the DFE. This scenario of adverse impact of public health measures, which had been shown previously to be theoretically possible in [1] , [9] , is only possible if k 1 is sufficiently small compared to \u03b3, knowing that R 0 is a convex combination of R 1 and R 2 (see 2). In other words, an ill-designed detection system might adversely lead to the epidemic increasing without bound if (i) random screening is not comprehensive enough (k 1 too small); (ii) lack of an education program to change behavior (\u03bb too high); and (iii) the prevalence is too high when the system is first implemented (initial infective populations outside of the domain of attraction of the DFE). This result further highlights the importance of universal testing in highprevalence regions [4] , [7] . On the other hand, if through an adequate education to change the behavior of the known infectious (so that \u03bb is sufficiently low) the average number of infections by a known infective is less than one, then either the DFE P 0 or the endemic equilibrium P * is globally asymptotically stable, leading to a more manageable epidemic for the public health purposes, even if the disease is not eradicated.",

It is only after 1999 that detection through the family doctors started to take on an important role in the yearly detection figures, arriving at more than 30% of new detections in a year. Another significant difference between the two periods chosen is \u03bb . In the first years (1986-1999) the sanatorial system played an important role in preventing HIV transmission from persons that had been detected. Hence we suppose that there is practically no transmission from the persons living with HIV (Y ) and assume \u03bb = 0 for the first period.",

The estimated mean values of the parameters k 1 , k 2 , and k 3 for each of the two periods with 95% confidence intervals, obtained from the 100 best fits, are given in Table 2 . We can also compute the theoretical values of the number of the unknown persons living with HIV, X(t), from the estimation results. For the unknown X we have between 2300 and 2400 at the end of 2008. By comparing the estimated results for the two periods, we conclude that detection by random screening (k 1 ) improved significantly after 1999, perhaps reflecting the steeper increase in reported cases after 2000 [3] , while detection via contact tracing (k 2 ) was at a similar level throughout the whole course of the epidemic. Detection by family doctors (k 3 ) was slightly higher than that of contact tracing after 1999 but of similar magnitude. Both the analytical result (of the dynamics) and the datafitting parameter estimates indicate that random screening was the most effective route of detection, while contact tracing and family doctors played mainly secondary roles, as had been previously proposed in [7] . The estimated values of the parameters in the model also allow us to calculate the three reproduction numbers, R 0 , R 1 , and R 2 , with the 95% confidence intervals for each of the two time periods which are given in Table 3 . As we can see, for both time periods the Cuba HIV epidemic is in the case of R 0 > 1, R 1 < 1 and R 2 > 1. P 0 is unstable and P * is globally asymptotically stable with the trajectories approaching P * asymptotically. Hence we can conclude that the HIV epidemic in Cuba is approaching (in the long term) an endemic steady state which we can estimate from our parameters using the expression obtained from our modeling for P * = (X * , Y * , Z * ) given in Equation (2) . That is, assuming no drastic changes in the prevention, transmission, detection, or treatment of HIV in Cuba in the long term future, there could be, eventually, around 2700 persons living with HIV that do not know they are infected. Further noting that the theoretical number of unknown persons living with HIV from the model is a little under 2400, we speculate with optimism that, at the endemic steady state, the number of persons living with HIV that represent the main core for the transmission of the epidemic in Cuba will not increase drastically, in the long term future.",

For example existing therapy reduces the probability of transmission for HIV, in terms of our model this means that coefficient \u03bb is reduced and this will make R 1 smaller, changing the value of the asymptotic point. But therapy delays the onset of AIDS, this means that \u03b2 gets smaller, also changing R 1 but making it bigger. So long term predictions (as in the case of asymptotic behavior) make sense only as an indicator of how is the epidemic going to behave. In this sense in table 1, we see that if R 1 > 1 trajectories could become unbounded, and this would mean that the epidemic is out of control. It is very important to manage the value of R 1 .",
