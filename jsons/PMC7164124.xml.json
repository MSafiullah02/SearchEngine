The subfamily contains four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus\n1, 3. The 5\u2032\u2010capped CoV genome consists of a 5\u2032\u2010untranslated region (UTR), open reading frames (ORFs), a 3\u2032\u2010UTR and a 3\u2032\u2010poly(A) tail.

            "text": "Using defective interfering RNAs (DI RNAs) and reverse\u2010genetics systems, the cis\u2010acting RNA elements required for CoV replication have been identified; these elements are largely located at the 5\u2010 and 3\u2032\u2010terminal regions of the genome (2, 4, 5, 6, 7 and references therein). In addition, several 5\u2032\u2010terminal structures have been suggested to function as cis\u2010acting RNA elements essential for replication (interpreted as (+)\u2010strand RNA synthesis). Among these structures, the leader sequence and stem\u2010loop I (SLI) in betacoronaviruses are also critical in (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis 8, 9, 10. Regarding the cis\u2010acting RNA elements at the 3\u2032\u2010terminal region of the genome, the 5\u2032\u2010most bulged stem\u2010loop (BSL) in betacoronaviruses is conserved and required for replication 11, 12. Downstream of BSL is a pseudoknot (PK) structure present in both beta\u2010 and alphacoronaviruses that is also essential for replication 13. The region next to the 3\u2032\u2010end of PK, referred to as the hypervariable region (HVR) is less conserved. In mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), the HVR contains a secondary structure that has been shown to be dispensable for replication but that has an important role in pathogenesis 14, 15. Furthermore, the 3\u2032\u2010most 55 nucleotides (nt) and poly(A) tail are also important for both (\u2212)\u2010 and (+)\u2010strand RNA synthesis in DI RNA systems of bovine coronavirus (BCoV) and MHV 16, 17, 18. Although it is known that a minimum poly(A) tail length of ~ 5\u201310 nt is required for (+)\u2010strand RNA synthesis of BCoV 18, the length required for efficient (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis has yet to be determined. More recently, Z\u00fcst et al. 19 proposed that a stem structure formed by base pairing between the 3\u2032\u2010most nt and loop 1 of the PK stem has an important function in the initiation of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. Using reverse\u2010genetic approaches, a subsequent study by Liu et al. 20 showed that disrupting the stem structure by mutation generated a lethal virus.",

            "text": "In CoVs, (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis is presumably initiated from the poly(A) tail 37, 38, an RNA element that is required for both translation and replication in CoVs 18, 38. Although the poly(A) tail at the end of 3\u2032 UTR of the CoV genome has been proposed to be required for efficient (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis 17, the length needed to initiate efficient synthesis remains to be determined. Additionally, it is also not known whether the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand synthesis increases as a linear function of poly(A) tail length. To address these questions, BM\u2010DI RNA 16, 39 derived from BCoV DI RNA and containing the MHV 3\u2032 UTR as a marker (Fig. 1A) was employed. Because the poly(A) tail length on BM\u2010DI RNA in the early infection of virus passage 1 (VP1) is ~ 25 nt 38 and a poly(A) tail of 25 nt has been shown to be efficient for (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis 16, the BM\u2010DI RNA, which has a replication efficiency similar to that of BCoV DI RNA 39, was then engineered to contain poly(A) tails ranging from 0 to 25 nt in length (Fig. 1B). Note that the DI RNA marked with the MHV 3\u2032 UTR allows us to distinguish it from the BCoV helper virus genome for subsequent (\u2212)\u2010strand detection by RT\u2010PCR. For (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA detection, head\u2010to\u2010tail ligation of RNA followed by RT\u2010PCR 10, 16, 39 was employed to differentiate the coronaviral polymerase\u2010generated (\u2212)\u2010strand DI RNA from the T7 RNA polymerase\u2010generated artifact (\u2212)\u2010strand DI RNA; this is because a product cannot be yielded from copy\u2010back (\u2212)\u2010strand transcripts after ligation with the primers used for RT\u2010PCR (Controls 3 and 4 in Fig. 1B, right panel). After 2 h of infection, DI RNA transcript was transfected into BCoV\u2010infected human rectum tumor (HRT)\u201018 cells. RNA was then collected at 8 h post\u2010transfection (hpt) and subjected to RT\u2010qPCR to evaluate the effect of poly(A) tail length on (\u2212)\u2010strand synthesis efficiency. It should be noted that there is no possibility of DI RNA\u2010BCoV genome recombinant synthesized at 8 hpt because no RT\u2010PCR product was observed (data not shown) using previously described methods 8, 16, 39. Surprisingly, (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis was still detected using DI RNA with no poly(A) tail (BM0A, Fig. 1B, right panel), and the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis for BM0A and BM5A was ~ 60% of that for BM25A. Sequencing results suggested that the poly(A) tail length for these DI RNA constructs was not altered at the time of sample collection. In addition, the level of (\u2212)\u2010strand synthesis was almost the same for BM15A and BM25A, suggesting that DI RNA with a 15\u2010nt poly(A) tail is sufficient for efficient synthesis of its (\u2212)\u2010strand counterpart. To further confirm the results of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis shown in Fig. 1B, RT\u2010qPCR was also performed using RNA samples without head\u2010to\u2010tail ligation 10. Although the detection of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA caused by T7 RNA polymerase\u2010generated copy\u2010back (\u2212)\u2010transcripts may occur, the levels of detected (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA by RT\u2010qPCR from uninfected cells transfected with transcripts can be used as the background levels. Thus, compared to the background levels, the increase in the detected (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis can be due to the activity of viral RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase. Using the method to detect (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis, it was determined that the efficiency of the (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis for BM0A and BM5A was ~ 50% of that for BM15A and BM25A (data not shown), consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1B in which RNA samples were head\u2010to\u2010tail ligated prior to RT\u2010qPCR. Accordingly, the results suggest that the length of the poly(A) tail on CoV DI RNA can affect the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis; however, the (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis did not increase as a linear function of DI RNA poly(A) tail length ranging from 0 to 25 nt. In addition, since the results from the two methods are similar, the head\u2010to\u2010tail ligation prior to RT\u2010qPCR for detection of (\u2212)\u2010strand synthesis was employed for the following experiments.",

To this end, the 25\u2010nt poly(A) tail at the 3\u2032\u2010terminus of DI RNA was replaced with a 25\u2010nt poly(U), poly(C) or poly(G) tail (Fig. 1C, left panel).

Note that no recombination between the DI RNA construct and helper virus genome occurred and that the length and sequence (i.e., 25\u2010nt poly(U), (C) and (G)) remained the same in these mutated DI RNAs and had not reversed to BM25A at the time of RNA collection (i.e., 8 hpt) (data not shown).

These findings led to the hypothesis that in addition to poly(A) tail length and sequence, other factors such as proteins interacting with the 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequence of DI RNA may also play an important role in (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. We speculated that the CoV N protein is a candidate factor involved in this interaction because it can bind to CoV genome 21, 22, 23, 24 including poly(A) tail 25 and is required for CoV replication 30, 31, 32. Because similar efficiencies of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis were observed for DI RNA with a poly(U), poly(C) or poly(G) tail (Fig. 1C), we hypothesized that the interaction of N protein with the DI RNA 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequence may correlate with (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis if N protein binds to poly(U), poly(C) and poly(G) tails with similar affinities. To test the hypothesis, 32P\u2010labeled RNA containing the CoV 3\u2032\u2010terminal 55 nt plus a 25\u2010nt poly(A), poly(U), poly(C) or poly(G) tail was generated (Fig. 2A, left panel) and the binding affinity between BCoV N protein (if not specified, the following N protein indicates BCoV N protein) and RNA was determined by the dissociation constant (Kd) derived from electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). As shown in Fig. 2B\u2013E, Kd values for the RNA containing CoV 3\u2032\u2010terminal 55 nt plus a 25\u2010nt poly(A), poly(U), poly(C) or poly(G) tail were calculated to be 31.1 \u00b1 1.2, 32.2 \u00b1 2.1, 31.7 \u00b1 3.7 and 30.2 \u00b1 2.2 nm, respectively, suggesting similar binding affinities (Fig. 2F). To highlight the biological relevance of such binding between the N protein and these RNA elements, we tested further whether the N protein exhibits different binding affinities with other RNA species. To this end, 80\u2010nt RNA probes derived from the 3\u2032\u2010terminus of the \u03b2\u2010actin mRNA and TOPO\u2010XL plasmid (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were synthesized. As shown in Fig. 2G, H, Kd for the two RNA species was ~ 3\u20135\u2010fold that of the RNA containing the CoV 3\u2032\u2010terminal 55 nt plus a 25\u2010nt poly(A), poly(U), poly(C) or poly(G) tail. Since BCoV DI RNA used for (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis assay contained MHV 3\u2032 UTR (Fig. 1), the binding affinity between MHV N protein and MHV 3\u2032\u2010terminal 55 nt plus a 25\u2010nt poly(A) was also determined. As shown in Fig. 2I, Kd for MHV N protein was 35.6 \u00b1 9.2 nm and similar to that (31.1 \u00b1 1.2 nm) for BCoV N protein, suggesting BCoV and MHV N proteins have similar binding affinity with MHV 3\u2032 terminus sequence. Together, the result supports our hypothesis that the N protein may be involved in (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis by interacting with DI RNA 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequence. In addition, as it is well characterized that poly(A)\u2010binding protein (PABP) binds to poly(A) tails with high affinity, the same RNA probes were also examined for their ability to interact with PABP (Fig. 3A) to evaluate whether PABP is also involved in the (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. As shown in Fig. 3B\u2010E, we calculated Kd values of 14.9 \u00b1 2.0 nm, 30.1 \u00b1 2.2 nm and 93.4 \u00b1 4.3 for RNA containing the CoV 3\u2032\u2010terminal 55 nt plus the 25\u2010nt poly(A), poly(U) and poly(C), respectively. However, we were unable to determine the Kd for RNA containing the CoV 3\u2032\u2010terminal 55 nt plus the 25\u2010nt poly(G), suggesting that the value may be greater than 150 nm. The results suggest that the binding of PABP to the CoV 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequence is less likely correlated with (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. Because (a) N protein but not PABP binds with similar affinity to the CoV 3\u2032\u2010terminal 55 nt plus a 25\u2010nt poly(U), poly(C) or poly(G) tail, (b) the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis is similar between DI RNA with a poly(U), poly(C) or poly(G) tail and (c) N protein binds with various affinities to other RNA probes containing different sequences (Fig. 2G,H), the results (Figs 1, 2, 3) together suggest that the N protein is involved in (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis.",

To further examine whether the binding of N protein to the 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequence is associated with (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis, RNA probes (Fig. 4A) containing the 3\u2032\u2010terminal 55 nt and various poly(A) tail lengths or only the 25\u2010nt poly(A) tail were constructed. In comparison with the binding affinity between the N protein and the 3\u2032\u2010terminal 55 nt plus a 25\u2010nt poly(A) tail (Kd: ~ 33 nm) (Fig. 4E), the binding affinity between N protein and the 3\u2032\u2010terminal 55 nt plus a 15\u2010nt poly(A) tail (Kd: ~ 40 nm) was slightly decreased (Fig. 4D).

            "text": "Z\u00fcst et al. 19 proposed that two helical stem structures (designated S3 and S4, Fig. 5A) form at the end of the MHV 3\u2032 UTR, and S3 is predicted to be important for initiating (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. Using reverse\u2010genetic approaches, Liu et al. 20 demonstrated that mutation in the 3\u2032\u2010side of S3 (designated construct E in that study) to disrupt the stem structure produced a lethal phenotype; however, the data regarding the relative level of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis between the mutant (construct E) and wild\u2010type (wt) virus are not available. Conversely, mutation in the 3\u2032\u2010side of S4 to disrupt the stem structure resulted in a viable virus. To experimentally determine the effect of the two structures on (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis, sequence substitution based on the aforementioned study by Liu et al. 20 at the 3\u2032\u2010side of S3 and S4 to disrupt the stem structures was performed using DI RNA BM25A; these constructs were designated BMmtS3 and BMmtS4, respectively (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5C, the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis from BMmtS3 was significantly impaired, whereas the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis from BMmtS4 was not altered in comparison with that from BM25A. Note that no recombination occurred between the helper virus BCoV and the three DI RNA constructs, and no sequence in these DI RNA constructs was altered (data not shown). The results, therefore, suggest that the S3 structure is critical for (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. Accordingly, the results are in agreement with those of the study by Liu et al. 20 in terms of virus viability and also support the model proposed by Z\u00fcst et al. 19. Next, we performed EMSA to determine the binding affinity between the N protein and the two helical stems, S3 and S4, and to evaluate whether binding affinity is also linked to the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. For this aim, RNA probes (Fig. 5D) predicted by the Mfold algorithm and containing intact S3 and S4 structures (wtS3S4), disrupted S3 and intact S4 structures (mtS3, by mutation at the 3\u2032\u2010side of S3) and intact S3 and disrupted S4 structures (mtS4, by mutation at the 3\u2032\u2010side of S4) were generated, and EMSA was performed to determine Kd. As shown in Fig. 5E,G, the binding affinity between the N protein and wtS3S4 (Kd: 70.3 nm) was similar to that between N protein and mtS4 (Kd: 66.3 nm). Conversely, the Kd value for the N protein and mtS3 could not be calculated (Fig. 5F), suggesting that the value is higher than 500 nm and that binding affinity is very low. Because the higher binding affinity (wtS3S4 and mtS4 with N) corresponds to more efficient (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis (BM25A and BMmtS4) and lower binding affinity (mtS3 with N protein) corresponds to less efficient (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis (BMmtS3) (Figs. 5C,H), the binding affinity of N protein to S3 structure is linked to the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. Therefore, the results suggest the involvement of N protein and S3 structure in (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis and thus support our hypothesis and the model proposed by Z\u00fcst et al. 19.",

            "text": "It has been shown that (\u2212)\u2010strand N sgmRNA can be synthesized using (+)\u2010strand N sgmRNA as a template 39, though the efficiency is decreased in comparison with that of DI RNA 10, a surrogate for the CoV genome. The discrepancy between the structure of N sgmRNA and DI RNA lies in the 5\u2032\u2010terminal sequence: DI RNA contains the 5\u2032\u2010terminal 498 nt of the CoV genome, but N sgmRNA contains only the 5\u2032\u2010terminal 77 nt of the genome. It was, therefore, speculated that such a structural difference is the main factor leading to various efficiencies of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. In the current study, as the interaction between N protein and 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequence was correlated with (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis (Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), we hypothesized that the binding affinity of N protein with the 5\u2032\u2010terminal structures of N sgmRNA and DI RNA may also explain the discrepancy in the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis between the two viral RNA species. To test the hypothesis, we first repeated the experiment by detecting (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis from N sgmRNA (sBM25A) and DI RNA (BM25A) 10. Note that, similar to BM25A, sBM25A was also engineered to contain the MHV 3\u2032 UTR for subsequent analysis of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA detection. As shown in Fig. 6A, the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis from sBM25A was decreased by ~ 50% when compared with that from DI RNA BM25A. In addition, no recombination was found between the helper virus BCoV and these DI RNA constructs and no sequence in these DI RNA constructs was altered (data not shown). Thus, the results are consistent with a previously published study 10. To evaluate whether such a decrease in (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis correlates with the binding affinity between the N protein and the 5\u2032\u2010terminal sequence, 120 nt of RNA probes BM5\u2032\u2010120 nts and sBM5\u2032\u2010120 nts (Fig. 6B), which are derived from the 5\u2032\u2010terminus of BM25A and sBM25A, respectively, and thus have different structures, were subjected to EMSA to determine the binding affinities with N protein. The Kd for BM5\u2032\u2010120 nt was 66.1 nm; however, that for sBM5\u2032\u2010120 nt could not be calculated (Figs. 6C,D), suggesting that the N protein binds to the 5\u2032\u2010terminal sequence of DI RNA BM25A with higher affinity than that of N sgmRNA. Because the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis from DI RNA is better than that from N sgmRNA and because N binds to the 5\u2032\u2010terminal sequence of DI RNA BM25A with better efficiency than that of N sgmRNA, the results also suggest the involvement of N protein in (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis and provide further evidence explaining how the discrepancy between 5\u2032 terminal structure of DI RNA and N sgmRNA affects the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand synthesis in the previously published study 10.",

In addition, N protein can interact with other N monomers via its C\u2010terminal domain 40, 41, 42. It was therefore hypothesized that the N protein mediates interaction between the 5\u2032\u2010 and 3\u2032\u2010ends of the CoV genome, circularizing the genome. To examine this possibility, RNAs containing the DI RNA BM25A 5\u2032\u2010terminal 120 nt (BM5\u2032\u2010120 nts) and the 3\u2032\u2010terminal 55 nt plus the poly(A) tail (3\u2032\u201055 ntsA25) (Fig. 7A), which are terminal RNA elements of CoV genome important for (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis (Figs 4,5 and 6), were labeled with biotin and [\u03b1\u201032P]ATP, respectively. The labeled RNAs (biotin\u2010BM5\u2032\u2010120 nts and 32P\u20103\u2032\u201055 ntsA25) were then incubated with the N protein followed by a streptavidin pull\u2010down assay, RNA extraction and denaturing gel electrophoresis to detect the signal of 32P\u20103\u2032\u201055 ntsA25 (Fig. 7B). As shown in Fig. 7C, lane 3, the 32P\u2010labeled RNA (32P\u20103\u2032\u201055 ntsA25) was detected (indicated by an arrow). However, the same 32P\u2010labeled RNA was not observed when biotin\u2010BM5\u2032\u2010120 nts and 32P\u20103\u2032\u201055 ntsA25 were incubated with Glutathione S\u2010transferase (lane 5). The results suggest that N protein is able to mediate the interaction between the 5\u2032\u2010 and 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequences of the CoV genome, circularizing the genome. Similar results were also found when biotin\u2010sBM5\u2032\u2010120 nts, an RNA element which is derived from the 5\u2032\u2010terminal 120 nt of N sgmRNA (sBM25A) (Fig. 7A) and has inefficient binding affinity with N protein (Fig. 6), and 32P\u20103\u2032\u201055 ntsA25 were incubated with the N protein although the signal of 32P\u20103\u2032\u201055 ntsA25 was weaker (Fig. 7C, lane 4). The amount of 32P\u20103\u2032\u201055 ntsA25 in lane 4 was ~ 6% of that in lane 3. Together, the results suggest that the N protein can act as a bridge to facilitate interaction between the 5\u2032\u2010 and 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequences of the CoV genome and subgenome, leading to their circularization. In addition, because the (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis (Fig. 6) and genome circularization from DI RNA (BM25A) are more efficient than those from N sgmRNA (sBM25A) (Fig. 7C), the results may also suggest that the circularization efficiency is involved in the (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis.",

Therefore, to determine the domains of BCoV N protein involved in the genome circularization and thus to further verify the 5\u2032\u2010 and 3\u2032\u2010terminal interaction event of the genome, the truncated forms of the BCoV N protein were constructed based on the aforementioned conclusion from HCoV\u2010OC43 42: one contained only the N\u2010terminal domain (N1\u2013300) and the other contained only the C\u2010terminal domain (N301\u2013448) (Fig. 7D), followed by a streptavidin pull\u2010down assay (Fig. 7E).

That is, the 5\u2032\u2010 and 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequences of the genome may bind to N\u2010terminal domain of the individual N protein monomer and then the two N protein monomers can interact with each other via its C\u2010terminal domain, circularizing genome.

For both viruses, the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis does not increase as a linear function of poly(A) tail length. These studies indicate that a certain length of poly(A) tail may be sufficient to serve as a mediator to recruit replication\u2010associated factors for (\u2212)\u2010strand synthesis 35, 44, 45, 46. In the current study, it was found that DI RNA with a 15\u2010nt poly(A) tail is sufficient for efficient (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis and such synthesis does not increase as a linear function of poly(A) tail length in DI RNA ranging from 0 to 25 nt. In addition, the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis is similar between DI RNA with a poly(U), poly(C) or poly(G) tail (Fig. 1C). These results support the speculation based on findings for Sindbis virus and poliovirus 44, 45 that factors other than the poly(A) tail that interact with both the poly(A) tail and adjacent 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequence may also be involved in (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis of CoV. Indeed, this argument is reinforced by the results presented in Figs 2, 4 and 5, whereby binding of N protein to the 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequence along with the poly(A) tail appears to be associated with (\u2212)\u2010strand synthesis. Because N protein in CoVs has been suggested to interact with replication complex 27, 28, 29, 47, the argument may also indicate that the binding of N protein with 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequence plus the 15\u2010nt poly(A) tail is sufficient to form a stable replication complex for initiating (\u2212)\u2010strand synthesis. Consequently, such argument in turn can explain why (\u2212)\u2010strand synthesis does not increase as a linear function of poly(A) tail length in CoV DI RNA as well as Sindbis virus and poliovirus 44, 45.",

Based on the results, it is speculated that such binding of the N protein to the 5\u2032\u2010 and 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequence or structure has an advantage in initiating (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis because this region of DI RNA bound by N rather than by PABP may prevent the binding of PABP to the poly(A) tail as well as subsequent translation factors 25. Under this circumstance, the N protein is able to efficiently interact with replication\u2010associated replicase proteins 27, 28, 29, 47 and initiate (\u2212)\u2010strand synthesis. Accordingly, the CoV N protein appears to have a more important role than PABP in (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis in terms of binding to the CoV 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequence including the poly(A) tail. As PABP does have a positive effect on replication 18, 48, we still cannot rule out its importance in other steps of the CoV life cycle, for example, translation, which may affect subsequent RNA synthesis.",

Although the subsequent study by Liu et al. 20 showed that mutation to disrupt the stem structure of S3 generates a lethal virus, the role of the S3 in (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis is still not known. In the current study, by using the same strategy to disrupt the structure of S3 but with DI RNA (BMmtS3, Fig. 5B), we found the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis from the BMmtS3 mutant to be significantly impaired (Fig. 5C), experimentally demonstrating the important role of the S3 structure in (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. The results, therefore, strongly support the (\u2212)\u2010strand initiation model proposed by Z\u00fcst et al. 19 and may explain in part why disruption of S3 produced a lethal phenotype in the study by Liu et al. 20. More importantly, we extend the findings to associate decreased efficiency in (\u2212)\u2010strand synthesis with the poor binding affinity between the N protein and the disrupted S3 structure (Fig. 5), further highlighting the involvement of N protein in (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis and expanding the model proposed by Z\u00fcst et al. 19. Indeed, the result that opening the S4 structure does not impair the efficiency of (\u2212)\u2010strand synthesis also supports the model and is consistent with that by Liu et al. 20. In addition, our findings also can explain why deletion of the 3\u2032\u2010terminal 55 nt, which also removes the S3 structure, from DI RNA severely impairs (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis in the current (Fig. 5C) and previous studies 16, 17. Based on our findings and those of others 19, 20, we extend the Z\u00fcst model and propose that stable binding of the N protein to the poly(A) tail and S3 structure is a critical step in the initiation of (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis in CoVs.",

            "text": "Several studies have suggested that cis\u2010acting RNA elements located at the 5\u2032\u2010terminus of the genome are also critical for (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis 8, 10, 49, 50. In the current study, we found that in addition to the 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequence or structure, the binding affinity of N protein to the 5\u2032\u2010terminal sequence also correlates with (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. As (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis is initiated from the 3\u2032\u2010terminus of the (+)\u2010strand genome, the question remains as to how binding of the N protein to 5\u2032\u2010terminal RNA elements in the (+)\u2010strand genome affects (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. We argue that genome circularization may be an important mechanism to address the question above. Indeed, a link between the 5\u2032\u2010 and 3\u2032\u2010termini of the viral genome via RNA\u2010RNA or RNA\u2010protein interaction has been suggested to initiate RNA synthesis in RNA viruses 9, 33, 35, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57. As the N protein can bind to both the 5\u2032\u2010 and 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequences of the CoV genome (Figs 2, 4, 5, 6) and N protein can interact with other N protein monomers, it is reasonable that the 5\u2032\u2010terminus can interact with the 3\u2032\u2010terminus via the N protein, circularizing the genome, as evidenced by the results shown in Fig. 7. In addition, alternations in the 5\u2032\u2010terminal sequence impair the efficiency of the interaction (Fig. 7C, lane 4) further explain the previously unsolved question of how 5\u2032\u2010terminal RNA elements in the (+)\u2010strand genome affect (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. Because the CoV N protein has been suggested to interact with CoV replicase proteins and cellular proteins, it is postulated that the interaction between the 5\u2032\u2010and 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequences and N protein may function as a platform to recruit replication\u2010associated proteins to constitute a stable replication complex, thereby initiating (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. In this sense, mutations in the 5\u2032\u2010 or 3\u2032\u2010terminal sequence, which decrease the binding affinity between N protein and both terminal sequences and thus the stability of the replication complex, lead to decreased (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. Consequently, without N protein to act as a bridge to form the replication complex, (\u2212)\u2010strand RNA cannot be initiated efficiently, impairing subsequent (+)\u2010strand RNA synthesis. This may explain why CoV recovery in many CoV reverse\u2010genetic systems can be significantly increased with addition of the N protein 30, 31, 47. Although RNA\u2010RNA or RNA\u2010protein interaction facilitating interaction between the 5\u2032\u2010and 3\u2032\u2010termini of the CoV genome has been suggested to be involved in RNA synthesis 6, 9, 36, 58, such interaction achieved via the N protein as a bridge has not been previously documented in CoVs.",
