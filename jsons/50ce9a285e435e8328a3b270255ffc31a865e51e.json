In this chapter, a new measurement system is introduced to inform HIV/AIDS control cross the globe. All countries with data available on area size, total population and total number of persons living with HIV (PLWH) were included, yielding a sample of 148 countries. Four indicators, including the total count, population-based p rate, geographic area-based g rate and population and geographic area-based pg rate were used as a 4D system to describe the global HIV epidemic. The total PLWH count provided data informing resource allocation for individual countries to improve HIV/AIDS care; and the top five countries with highest PLWH count were South Africa, Nigeria, India, Kenya, and Mozambique. Information from the remaining three indicators provided a global risk profile of the HIV epidemic, supporting HIV/AIDS prevention programming strategies. Five countries with highest p rates were Swaziland, Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa, and Zimbabwe; five countries with highest g rates were Swaziland, Malawi, Lesotho, Rwanda, and Uganda; and five countries with highest pg rates were Barbados, Swaziland, Lesotho, Malta, and Mauritius. According to pg rates, two HIV hotspots (south and middle Africa and Caribbean region) and one HIV belt across Euro-Asian were identified. In addition to HIV/AIDS, the 4D measurement",

This is because given the same level of likelihood for a disease to spread, the head count of a disease will differ for countries and regions with different population sizes. A country or region with a larger population will have more people at risk of suffering from a disease than a country or region with a smaller population given the same risk level. Epidemiologists have overcome the limitation of headcount data by using the indicator rate. Methodologically, a rate is a measure that adjusts the impact of population size in assessing disease risk (Chen, 2017; Chen & Wang, 2017) . Disease rates therefore provide a measure more informative than disease count for comparison across regions within a country, and across countries in the world.",

While appreciating the value and utility of the two epidemiologic indicators, we cannot overlook their limitations. Although measures of disease rate are more informative than measures of headcount with regard to informing levels of risk of a disease at the population level, both headcount and disease rate cannot address another key factor-the size of geographic areas people reside (Chen, 2017; Chen & Wang, 2017) . To fill in this methodology gap, in this chapter, we will introduce a new measurement system by incorporating geographic area size into measurement. We illustrate the new measurement system using the global HIV epidemic as an example.",

For example, the number of PLWH by country is needed for resource allocation to achieve the 90-90-90 proposed by UNAIDS. If it costs on average $1000 to treat one PLWH per year, a total of $39 billion will be needed to treat all the 39 million PLWH in the world. There were 850,000 PLWH in China in 2015, which meant China needs $850 million per year to treat these infected persons.",

For example, in 2015, there were 850,000 PLWH in China and 830,000 in Brazil (see Appendix to this chapter for detailed data). If larger number of PLWH meant higher risk of HIV transmission, people in China may face a higher risk than people in Brazil.

Following the same example in the previous paragraph, the p rate for Brazil was 3.993/1000 population, 6.4 times higher than 0.630/1000, the p rate for China.

If people from the two countries reside on a same size of a geographic area (say, like Swaziland), the risk of HIV transmission would be 113 times (19,440,000/172,000) higher in Swaziland than in Mexico.

Like the p rate for population, g rate provides a measure to gauge the HIV epidemic by adjusting these differences in geographic sizes for cross-country comparisons. This is one of the two new indicators we introduced in this chapter. The world average and top 15 countries with highest g rates are listed in Table  8 .3. The estimated g rate for Swaziland was 1279.1 PLWH/100km 2 , 44.4 times that of the world average of 28.8. Of the top five countries, three with g rates greater than 1000 PLWH per unit geographic area of 10\u00d710 km 2 . Figure 8 .3 depicts the global HIV epidemic using the estimated g rates of PLWH. Similar to Fig. 8.2 , the top 20% countries with highest g rates were colored in darkred; and these countries were roughly located in three regions of the world. (1) Africa: including a strip of countries from Kenya in the north to South Africa in the south and a small group of countries in the East Africa (Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, and Cameron); (2) several countries in Southeast Asia (Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam); and (3) several other countries in Caribbean (Costa Rica, Dominican, Hatti and Jamaica). Fig. 8.3 The Global HIV epidemic measured by g rates (PLWH/per 100 km 2 ). Note: Grey area data not available",

The estimated pg rate indicated that worldwide, there were 0.005 PLWH/million population/100 km 2 . As usual, Table 8 .4 lists the top 15 countries with highest pg rates. Barbados was now the country with the highest pg rate in the world with 2127.9 PLWH per million population per 100 km 2 . This rate was 425,580 times that of the world average and 30 times that of Rwanda, the last one among the top 15.

This country would be low at HIV transmission if the total number of PLWH (only 4900) and p rate (0.894/1000) were used; however, it became a high-risk country and ranked number 6 in the world when assessed using g rate (126.1 per 1000,000 population per 100 km 2 ).",

It is an index of the number of PLWH in a given number of population and a geographic area.

Based on the definition, pg rate will be high for countries with large number of headcount of persons suffering from or died of a disease, but a small population and small geographic area. For example, pg rate was 993.861 for Swaziland, which means roughly 1000 PLWH in every million population residing in an area of 100 km 2 ; while the corresponding pg rate was 0.007 for China, indicating much lower risk of HIV transmission. Given all other conditions the same, the likelihood for HIV (or any other infectious disease) to transmit from one to another in a place with small area and a large number of populations will be greater than in a place with large area and small number of populations.",
