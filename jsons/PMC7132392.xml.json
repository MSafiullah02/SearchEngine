CBPP is responsible for heavy economic losses due to mortality, loss of weight, reduced working ability or fertility. A recent study evaluated the total economic cost of CBPP in Africa (direct and indirect production losses and disease control costs) at 44.8 million euros [1]. Accurate data, requiring efficient epidemiological surveillance networks, are however lacking [2]. CBPP is included in the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) list of pathologies requiring official declaration (http://www.oie.int). Infected countries are thus excluded from international trade.",

However, in Africa, the sanitary measures used on other continents to successfully eradicate CBPP are impracticable since cattle raising rely on nomadism and transhumance. The disease was reported in 17 countries in 2001 and in 20 countries in 2004 (http://www.oie.int/hs2/). In 1994, in Bostwana, stamping out the whole cattle population in the affected zones was the ultimate choice of the veterinary services, because vaccination with the available T1 vaccine failed to stop the spread of the disease. This strategy proved very efficient and enabled Bostwana to regain its freedom status, but it remains too expensive to be applied in other African countries [2].",

The T1-based vaccines currently in use are of low efficacy and require annual, costly vaccination campaigns [3]. These vaccines, made from freeze-dried broth cultures of live attenuated MmmSC strains (T1/44 and T1SR), present severe limitations such as the short duration of immune protection, although longer for the T1/44 strain compared to the T1/SR, and persistent side effects, mainly for the T1/44 strain [3]. Several studies have suggested a possible improvement of their efficacy through the combined use of antibiotics, changes in vaccine formulation, or the use of a prime-boost strategy [2], [4]. However, this might be too expensive or insufficient to overcome the intrinsic limitations of the vaccine. Based on immunological knowledge, another approach could rely on new routes of vaccine delivery. Indeed, it is well known for mucosal diseases, such as CBPP, that mucosal delivery would significantly improve the efficacy of the host immune response [5]. So far, however, this approach has not received the attention it deserves. There is, therefore, a need for improved vaccines that could overcome the T1 vaccine limitations and trigger long-term protection and which, coupled to effective surveillance systems and control of animal movements, would represent the most relevant tool to achieve eradication of CBPP from Africa.",

Recovering cattle, therefore, not only succeed in controlling the MmmSC infection by mounting an appropriate immune response, but also retain in their lymph nodes an MmmSC-specific immune memory able to trigger an anamnestic protective response [8]. This objective is also supported by the experiments made by Willems in 1852 showing that subcutaneous inoculation of CBPP-infective lymph protected cattle against an MmmSC challenge [9]. These findings demonstrate that a long-term protective immune response against MmmSC can be naturally developed and most probably also vaccine induced in cattle.",

Recent studies have led to improved knowledge of CBPP, which leads to defining more relevant vaccine strategies against the disease. This review gives a rapid overview of most recent results and discusses rational strategies for the development of optimized sub-unit vaccines. Because the safety of vaccines is paramount and because live vectored vaccines, although powerful, raise some concerns regarding safety, stability, potential reversion to virulence or effectiveness in the presence of pre-existing immunity, the trend in vaccinology now focuses on the design of safer and better-defined sub-unit vaccines.",

Identifying the MmmSC-specific immune protective mechanisms is thus a major prerequisite to the development of efficient vaccines. To this aim, recent studies were implemented to characterize the immune response elicited in cattle after natural MmmSC infection. Comparative analyses of the MmmSC-specific humoral and cellular immune responses were performed between animals recovering or dying from the MmmSC infection. Cattle recovering from an MmmSC infection are known to develop long-term immunity [6], [7]. Characterization of the MmmSC-specific immune mechanism generated, therefore, during the primary immune response and persisting in the regional lymph nodes of these recovered animals will thus unravel the basis of immune protection against CBPP and the MmmSC-specific memory response, responsible for the protective anamnestic response. Understanding the mechanisms operative in the development of these memory T-cells is a central goal in the development of effective vaccination strategies.",

Data on the MmmSC-specific local cell-mediated immune response, although very valuable to unravel the complete protective mechanisms against CBPP, are not yet available due to the difficulty to assess this aspect in cattle. Nevertheless, a key finding is the persistence of the MmmSC-specific IFN\u03b3-secreting CD4+ T-cells in the draining lymph nodes of recovered cattle several months after infection. Indeed, studies of several viral or bacterial diseases indicate that while a pool of effector T-cells is expanded during active infection, only memory cells remains detectable after infection resolution [12]. Both arms of the immune system are, therefore, playing a role in protection against CBPP, the local humoral response relying on secretory IgAs and the cellular response based on CD4+ T-cells of the Th1-like type. Consequently, both represent the main target to be elicited or primed by a vaccine with the induction and expansion of a subset of MmmSC-specific CD4+ memory T-cells as the required goal to develop long-term protection against CBPP.",

            "text": "CBPP being a respiratory disease whose pathogen generally remains restricted to the lungs, a key role for the local humoral response was predictable. Immunoglobulin A is, indeed, the main element of the humoral response to provide protection against microbial antigens entering mucosal surfaces and represents an important first line of defense against invasion of deeper tissues [5]. The IgA response might play a direct role by inhibiting MmmSC growth and colonization and/or blocking some yet unknown virulence factors. A CD4+ T-cell response was also expected since MmmSC is an extracellular pathogen [13]. Extracellular pathogens are generally taken up by antigen presenting cells (APC) and processed in association with the class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) for presentation to the CD4+ T-lymphocytes. CD4+ T-cells should contribute to protection against CBPP mainly through their cytokine network including IFN\u03b3 that will enhance phagocytosis and cell killing ability and promote the expression of MHC class II molecules, thus increasing the host cell capacity for antigen processing and epitope presentation to T-lymphocytes [14]. A protective role for the IFN\u03b3-induced IgG2 antibody, only able to promote killing by neutrophils in cattle, is also expected since neutrophil recruitment has been observed in CBPP lung lesions [15], [16], [17]. Besides, CD4+ T-cells play also a key role in facilitating B-cell proliferation and class-switching to give rise to antigen-specific IgAs in mucosal effector sites [5]. Whether Th1 or Th2 cells are beneficial for optimal IgA production is not known as either Th1 or Th2 cells or their combination can support antigen-specific IgA responses [5].",

Several of these components are membrane lipoproteins (Lpps), which might have a central role in interaction between MmmSC and the host cells and in the inflammatory reaction [25], [26]. Besides the capacity of Lpps to elicit an humoral response, their strong potential to trigger also a cell-mediated response and their major role in the early host response was reported [27], [28]. Some proteins are known to display both B-cell and T-cell epitopes and several vaccines such as those against influenza, malaria or Yersinia pestis are based on this type of antigens [29], [30], [31]. A similar approach to select MmmSC vaccine candidates is currently being undertaken by in vitro assessment of the ability of a panel of antibody-inducing MmmSC antigens to elicit an MmmSC-specific CD4+ Th1-like T-cell response (Dedieu, unpublished data). To this aim, the capacity of four MmmSC Lpps (LppA, LppB, LppC and LppQ) to recall in vitro a cellular immune response from lymphocytes taken from three MmmSC-infected cattle was evaluated. The results showed that LppA was the only MmmSC protein recognized by the MmmSC-primed lymphocytes (Dedieu, submitted). This finding demonstrates that MmmSC-infected cattle, besides their known humoral response against MmmSC LppA, do also develop an LppA-specific T-cell response. The MmmSC LppA, a highly conserved lipoprotein, might be retained as a potential vaccine candidate against CBPP due to its ability to trigger both arms of the host immune response. At this time, however, the protective efficacy of an LppA-triggered immune response has to be further evaluated.",

Control of the pathogenicity should also be achieved, since H2O2 is considered as a virulence factor [32], [33], [34]. Similarly, an antibody response blocking membrane components of metabolic pathways such as the ABC transporters will likely limit MmmSC growth and thus host infection. Indeed, due to its drastic parasitic mode, MmmSC is dependent on these ABC transporters to scavenge precursors from the host cells.

ISCOMs also have great potential in the delivery of antigens to the mucosa [35]. However, in the two experiments conducted in cattle with ISCOM vaccines against CBPP, the vaccines were delivered parenterally and failed to protect the animals against an MmmSC challenge [40], [41]. Another possible reason for this failure is that these vaccines were based on either whole inactivated MmmSC or the cytotoxic LppQ protein. In contrast, oral delivery in pigs of another pathogenic mycoplasma, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, included in microspheres led to effective protection [42]. Therefore, these new antigen delivery systems might offer promising approaches for mucosal vaccine delivery in large animals.",

            "text": "Advances in the understanding of the protective immune responses to MmmSC infection are providing promising opportunities for the rational development of improved vaccines. Protection was shown to require MmmSC-specific pulmonary IgAs and activation of the local macrophages through stimulation of MmmSC-specific CD4+ IFN\u03b3-secreting T-cells. Both immunological arms could be effectively targeted by a mucosal vaccine. Indeed, induction of protective secretory IgAs was shown to be efficiently achieved after mucosal antigenic stimulation, such as the targeting of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues and local lymph nodes [5]. To enhance the priming of MmmSC-specific IFN\u03b3 secreting CD4+ T-cells, a Th1-inducing adjuvant will have to be used with a delivery system allowing the vaccine antigens to be presented by the APC MHC class II pathway. This objective could be achieved using microparticles (biodegradable microspheres, chitosan, liposomes, ISCOM, etc.) which can increase host cell phagocytosis, antigen uptake and MHC class II presentation to CD4+ T-cells. Besides, the ability of these particulate systems to also elicit local IgAs has largely been demonstrated [35], [36]. The potency of these delivery vehicles can be further enhanced by incorporating adjuvants or coating with immunostimulating molecules such as lectins or Toll-like receptor ligands, which would reduce the quantity of antigen needed and thus the cost of the vaccine. Various strategies are already under evaluation to enhance particulate vaccine uptake and efficacy [35].",

However, in our context of tropical veterinary diseases, where the final objective is vaccine technology transfer to our African partners for local production, other criteria have to be taken into account, such as thermostability, cost effectiveness, manufacturing process and energy requirement, etc. While these are very stringent criteria, one can hope that due to the rapid progress in this field, it will be achievable in the near future. The final choice will then rely on preliminary evaluation by in vitro assays for efficacy testing in the presence of the MmmSC vaccinal candidates. Unfortunately, no small animal models are relevant for CBPP studies and cattle experiments are very costly as they require high security facilities when dealing with tropical diseases. Therefore, although not fully relevant in terms of mucosal immunity, in vitro cellular assays will help determine the capacity of the delivery systems to be efficiently captured by bovine APCs and their efficacy to trigger DC maturation, epitope presentation and MmmSC-specific CD4+ Th1-like T-cell response from autologous T-cells taken from recovering cattle. Cattle experiments will then permit to evaluate the vaccine-induced mucosal immunity and the protective efficacy against CBPP infection.",

To this aim, it was shown that the immune parameters that correlate with protection are the mucosal production of MmmSC-specific IgAs and a persistent MmmSC-specific INF\u03b3-secreting CD4+ T-cell response. Accordingly, the MmmSC vaccine candidates will have to be selected on these criteria.",
