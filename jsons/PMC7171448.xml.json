In total, 391 Vietnamese people aged 15\u201347 years were surveyed for COVID-19-related risk perceptions. The platform for data collection is an Internet research tool provided by the University of Economics, Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam). The total time duration for survey was 20 days, and the survey was conducted in Vietnamese.",

Social and mass media could influence the risk perception [4] because the information might refer to heuristics. Thus, our questionnaire includes social media use behavior, which might contribute to the perceived risk in each sample. The personal characteristics are the potential sources that have an impact on risk perception [5].

In addition, apart from risk perception, the respondents were asked to consider the level of fake news as well as the overwhelming news of governmental office about COVID-19 in the 10-point Likert scale. In fact, these questions focus on the respondents\u2019 perception of the number of (fake/official) news. Therefore, we asked the participant the level of overwhelming information on the online platform that they used to search for COVID-19 information. Survey data were collected through an anonymous self-administered questionnaire on the Internet platform. We randomly distributed the questionnaires to three regions in Vietnam (North, Central and South). Our data are the primary and first survey conducted about COVID-19 in Vietnam, a developing country. The analysis of our data could be done by STATA and other software to visualize and use for further econometric models. Therefore, follow-up studies might extend our work and enable to determine some helpful features to succeed in the containment of COVID-19.",
