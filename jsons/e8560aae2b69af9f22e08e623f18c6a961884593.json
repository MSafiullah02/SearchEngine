This chapters reviews the role of these cells in the normal brain and their contribution to inflammatory demyelinating disease, including their role in antigen presentation, co-stimulation, and production of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators The microglia, a brain-resident, non-neuronal cell and the blood-derived or haematogenous macrophage represent two related cell types involved in key events in the development of pathology in Multiple Sclerosis and its autoimmune animal model, the Experimental Allergic Encephalomyelitis. Microglia and macrophages fulfil a variety of different functions, but they are also recognized for their ability to act as a particularly fine sensor of brain pathology. Both cell types are rapidly activated and recruited to sites of infection, neurodegeneration, stroke, autoimmune inflammatory models such as EAE and its presumptive human counterpart, multiple sclerosis. Microglia and macrophages are stimulated by a variety of cytokines, neurotransmitters, modulators and putative neurotoxins, extracellular matrix molecules and proteases present in the inflamed central nervous system. Moreover, both cell types are plastic in their morphology and cellular identity. The presence of dying cells and cell debris will cause a transformation of phagocytic microglia into a detached, rounded and migratory or amoeba-like (amoeboid) macrophage (Streit et al., 1988; Bohatschek et al., 2001). This also works in reverse: surrounded by a CNS environment, non-phagocytic macrophages freshly recruited from the blood stream will gradually develop",

The brain microglia comprise the largest component, located inside the neural parenchyma. In the normal resting state, they are highly ramified cells, with extensive branches that can cover spaces of 30-50 lam in diameter. These resting microglia are territorial, in that their cell bodies or branches are rarely seen to adhere to one another, unlike white matter oligodendrocytes contacting one another like pearls on a string (Suzuki and Raisman, 1992) or protoplasmic astrocytes with extensive cell process to process contacts at astrocyte boundaries which allow the spread of intracellular ions and other small molecules from one astrocyte to the next (Nedergaard, 1994; Bushong, 2002) .",

Most perivascular macrophages are located around small to moderate blood vessels inside the central nervous system. Unlike the microglia, they do not show the elaborate ramified structure typical of resting microglia, which could be due to spatial constraints, but also to a molecular and cellular micro-environment, different from that of neural parenchyma. These differences also extend to molecular markers, such as MHC2, cyclo-oxygenase or scavenger receptors, found on normal perivascular macrophages but not in resting microglia (Linnehan et al., 1999) , and the paucity of the aMb2 integrin (Angelov et al., 1992) .",

Immunohistochemically, meningeal macrophages are more closely related to perivascular macrophages, macrophages in chorio-epithelial and ventricular epithelial tissue and less to the highly ramified, resting microglia inside neural parenchyma. On the whole, the basal membranes of vessels meninges, ventricular and chorioepithelium, mark an anatomical border between two brain macrophage subpopulations: the ramified microglia inside the neural parenchyma that lacks intrinsic basal membranes, and perivascular, meningeal, ventricular or chorioepthelial cells sitting on the external side of the surrounding basal membranes.",

In others, it is used to denote microglia in the neural parenchyma with processes that contact blood vessels from the inside . Since each microglial cell covers a relatively large territory of well vascularized tissue, up to 50-70 ~tm in diameter, some contact is probably unavoidable, and labelling a microglial cell \"perivascular\", like that shown in figure 1C can simply reflect a particularly prominent process attached to a vessel costained by the same molecular marker.",

            "text": "Despite this clear anatomical partition, between microglia and macrophages, there is clearly at least some exchange between and plasticity in the individual compartments. Perivascular macrophages are gradually replenished by a pool of circulating monocytes, with a half-life of 1-2 months. A small population of macrophages migrate through basal membrane into neural parenchyma, to differentiate into ramified microglia, a process enhanced in different forms of neuropathology (Streit et al., 1989; Priller et al., 2001 ), including EAE (Fluegel et al., 2001 . Resident microglia in the adult brain are themselves descendents of 2 waves of macrophage infiltration into neural parenchyma -a very early one, from the surrounding mesodermal tissue (Navascues et al., 1995; Cossmann et al., 1997; Kurz and Christ, 1998) , then as a second wave, as \"fountains of microglia\" in CNS white matter during axonal pruning in the late fetus/newborn (Rio-Hortega cf Brockhaus et al., 1996) , but this is followed by rapid differentiation, arborisation and quiescence, turning into the resting, ramified phenotype. However, the same resident microglia can be rapidly activated by a host of different pathologies, lose branching and transform into amoeboid macrophages. Some debris-laden transformed microglia also appear to migrate from neural parenchyma into the perivascular, Robin-Virchow space, where they can stay for a very long time (Kosel et al., 1997) , which could set the scene for an interaction with T-cells homing onto perivascular macrophages (Walter et al., 2001) .",

In brain tissue, the PK1195 binding site is highly selective for microglia and macrophages, it is rapidly activated in even in moderate forms of brain pathology (Stephenson et al., 1995; Banati et al., 1997) and can be used map the spatial pattern of microglial activation in multiple sclerosis (Banati et al., 1999; Cagnin et al., 2001) . Compared with magnetic resonance imaging with or without Gadolinium, the PET-based technique shows a higher sensitivity with respect to identifying white mater regions at risk and provides a good correlation with disease process and appearance of neurological deficit (Banati et al., 2000) . These recent human data underscore the importance of brain macrophage activation as a diagnostic tool, to identify the localization and disease activity in multiple sclerosis. On the biochemical level, macrophage and microglial activity in MS and EAE is associated with a strong upregulation of molecules involved in antigen presentation, myelin and tissue breakdown, production of reactive oxygen substances. They also synthesize components of the complement cascade, cytokines, growth factors and neurotrophins, chemotactic molecules, excitotoxins and apoptosis-inducing substances, and their receptors. These molecules, reviewed in the following paragraphs, as well as in more detail in the preceding and following chapters of this book, are involved in inducing and regulating the level of macrophage activation, interaction with encephalitogenic lymphocytes, mediating damage to myelin, axons and oligodendrocytes, as well as inducing the repair of the injured white matter.",

T cells are known to recognize their specific antigen when associated to the class I or class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex, abbreviated as MHC1 and MHC2 (for a review see Zinkernagel and Doherty, 1997) . This recognition is aided by the binding of T-cell accessory molecules CD4 and CD8, expressed by the Thelper (mainly CD4+) and the T-suppressor/cytotoxic (mainly CD8+) lymphocytes, to their respective MHC2 or MHC1 ligands (Fleury et al., 1991; Miceli and Parnes, 1991) . Despite the strong MHC class-selectiveness in the presentation of specific antigen -MHC1 for the endogenous (cytoplasmic) and MHC2 for the exogenous (phagocytosed) antigen, recent studies point to the existence of alternative and highly effective pathways for the presentation of exogenous antigen via MHC1 (Reimann et al., 1994; Larsson et al., 2001) . In addition, non-classical MHCl-like molecules such as CD1 can also present antigen, particularly glycolipids, to the CD8+ as well as to the CD4-CD8-(double null) T-lymphocytes (Sugita et al., 1998) .",

However, studies using beta2microglobulin-deficient mice do show that MHC1 is involved in mediating EAE elicited by adoptively transferred, encephalitogenic CD8+ T-cells (Sun et al., 2001) . This effect is direct and not mediated by some indirectly stimulated host CD4+ lymphocytes, a point demonstrated using the RAG 1-/, immunodeficient mice (Sun et al., 2001) . In the majority of cases, antigen presentation by CDI+ cells appears to inhibit EAE (Lider et al., 2001; Miyamoto et al., 2001) , although this depends on the cytokine requirements of the specific form of EAE (Jahng et al., 2001) . In the case of MHC2, most initial reports tended to emphasize that microglial expression of MHC2 may present antigen to encephalitogenic T-cells, needed to initiate or promote the inflammatory and demyelinating process (Hayes et al., 1987; McGeer et al., 1988) . More recent studies have focused on their counter-regulatory and immunosuppressive properties. EAE-inducing effects are now attributed to perivascular macrophages.",

On the other hand, high level of microglial MHC2 corresponds with resistance to EAE in different strains of rats (Sedgwick et al., 1993; Klyushnenkova et al., 1997) . Exposure to microglial MHC2 also appears to induce T cell apoptosis, unlike the perivascular macrophages that promote T-cell survival (Ford et al., 1996; Klyushenkova et al., 1997) . Presentation of antigen to non-encephalitogenic T-cells appears to play an important part in preventing excessive autoimmunity. Thus, adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic T-cells in mice with severe combined autoimmunity (scid) leads to a much more severe and recurrent form of EAE compared with immunocompetent mice . The particularly strong and profuse upregulation of MHC2 on parenchymal microglia during early remission (Konno et al., 1989; McCombe et al., 1992) thus appears to make an important contribution in strengthening the immunosuppressive action of microglial MHC2.",

However, most studies concur that the majority of the accessory molecule-positive cells in MS and EAE that present antigen to T-lymphocytes are hematogenous in origin and concentrated in the perivascular infiltrates (Williams et al., 1994; De Simone et al., 1995; Gerritse et al., 1996; Laman et al., 1998; Weinberg et al., 1999) . Adoptive transfer of encephalitogenic T-cells strongly enhances the influx of bone marrow-precursors of dendritic cells to the site of CNS inflammation. Moreover, these newly recruited dendritic cells, with the appropriate MHC molecules, are fully sufficient to induce inflammation and myelin destruction in mice following adoptive transfer of rat bone marrow and rat encephalitogenic T-cells (Subramanian et al., 2001) . This point is also underscored by recent study using bone marrow chimaeras between the CD40 wild type (CD40+/+) and CD40 null (CD40-/-) animals, with the latter normally resistant to EAE (Becher et al., 2001) . Replacement of the CD40+/+ bone marrow with that from a CD40-/-animal, turning perivascular macrophages and newly recruited dendritic cells to CD40-/-, while retaining CD40+/+ microglia, prevents the appearance of EAE in almost all animals. On the other hand, the transfer of CD40+/+ bone marrow to the irradiated, CD40-/-host, causes an almost complete recovery of EAE susceptibility in the host, with just a minor delay (+20%) and reduction in the maximal severity of clinical symptoms (-25%), compared to normal, CD40+/+ animals receiving a CD40+/+ bone marrow transplant (Becher et al., 2001) .",

Studies using genetically deficient animals and/or neutralizing antibodies also show that the chemoattractive molecules play an important role in the pathology of EAE. Transgenic deletion of CCR1, the receptor for MIPla, CCR2, the receptor for MCP1, or CCR8, the receptor for TCA3, strongly reduce the susceptibility, onset and severity of EAE (Rottman et al., 2000; Huang et al., 2001; Murphy et al., 2002) . A similar inhibitory effect is also observed with the antibody inactivation of MCP1 (Karpus et al., 1995) . That these molecules are produced in the brain has suggested that brain-resident cells, particularly microglia, may also play a role in the induction of EAE (Murphy et al., 2002) . However, this point is contentious and needs to be confirmed, using bone marrow chimaeras. The fact that many of these chemokines and chemokine receptors are located on blood-borne macrophages, particularly in perivascular cuffs, could argue against a major contribution by microglia.",

Moreover, the inhibitory effects of IFNgR+/+ macrophages could be suppressed by an inhibitor of iNOS, underscoring the importance of NO in regulating the T-cell response. Interestingly, bone marrow chimaeras between IFNgR+/+ and IFNgR-/show that the presence of IFNg receptors on just one, blood-borne or brain resident component, was sufficient to prevent the normally lethal outcome following the induction of EAE in IFNgR-/-mice (Willenborg et al., 1999) .",

They play an important role as antigen-presenting cells in the initial demonstration of antigen (Hickey and Kimura, 1988; Jones et al., 1999) , and secondary recruitment of T-cells, granulocytes and macrophages . They also produce a long list of potentially damaging substances, including reactive oxygen species, NO and peroxynitrite, TNFa, interleukin-lb and excitotoxins (see above). As a case in point, interleukin lb has been shown to activate mixed glial cell cultures to produce glutamate agonist neurotoxins that cause oligodendroglial cell death (Takahashi et al., 2003) . MSassociated inflammation leads to a strong increase in glutamate receptors on axons in the centre of CNS lesions and on neighboring, reactive astrocytes (Geurts et al., 2003) , which could predispose them to damage by the glialderived excitotoxins. Axonal damage is particularly intense at early disease stages of MS (Kuhlmann et al., 2002) , which could correspond to particularly intense microglial activation . Microglia and macrophages are also the chief debris-removing cells that eliminate damaged myelin, resulting in the widespread loss of axonal covering the CNS white matter. Last, but not least, microglia and macrophages appear to play a decisive role in the induction of remission, as well as resistance to the induction of the disease (Konno et al., 1989; McCombe et al., 1992; Willenborg et al., 1999) .",

Most studies concur that blood-derived macrophages are crucial in the induction of EAE. Removal of bone marrow monocyte precursors and circulating macrophages with clodronate reduces the parenchymal influx of new macrophages, interferes with lymphocyte recruitment and microglial proliferation Plofriet et al., 2002) . The same macrophage depleting treatment also blocks adoptively transferred EAE (Huitinga et al., 1995; Tran et al., 1998) . Similar, disease-abolishing results were also obtained in bone marrow chimaeras, when bone marrow-derived macrophages (but not microglia) lacked the appropriate MHC antigens, accessory molecules (CD40) or cytokines such as TNFa that promote demyelinating disease (Hickey and Kimura, 1988; Stalder et al., 1998; Subramanian et al., 2001; Becher et al., 2001; Murphy et al., 2002) , underscoring the significance of blood derived macrophages.",

            "text": "Nonetheless, there are several lines of evidence that begin to shed light on the importance of brain resident microglia at different stages of the demyelinating disease. The initiation of the autoimmune response is an important case in point. For example, the acute transfer of rat encephalitogenic T-lymphocytes and appropriate antigen presenting cells (APC) to scid mice causes a delay phase of approximately 8 days before the onset of EAE (Subramanian et al., 2001) , pointing to the importance of local APC in the early initial stages. This point is underscored by the very rapid microglial response to the adoptive transfer of EAE, in this case the induction of microglial amyloid precursor protein, within 24 hours after the infusion of encephalitogenic T-cells in animals with the appropriate MHC antigens (Banati et al., 1995) . Studies using bone marrow chimaeras also show that microglia are much more effective removers of myelin than bloodderived macrophages (Rinner et al., 1995) . Finally, brain-resident microglia also play a decisive role in limiting the extent of demyelination, preventing lethal outcome and inducing disease remission (Konno et al., 1989; McCombe et al., 1992; Willenborg et al., 1999) . Here, new insights into the function and molecular signals of macrophages and microglia, their interaction with each other, as well as with T-lymphocytes, axons and myelin-producing oligodendroglia, could pave the way to introducing new and more effective therapies to the human demyelinating disease.",

All images follow the radiological convention, i.e. the left side of the image corresponds to subject's right side. (A) Three orthogonal views of [11C](R)-PKll195 images co-registered and overlaid on the MRI of Patient 9, showing spinothalamic tract-associated [11C|(R)-PK11195 signals extending through the brainstem and pons into the thalamus. (B-D) Tl-weighted (B) and T2-weighted (C) MRI and [11C](R)-PK11195 PET (overlaid onto Tl-weighted MRI) (D) of Patient 9 show lesions in all different spin-echo MRI sequences that partially overlap with areas of significantly increased [11C](R)-PK11195 binding (red arrow). The white arrow points to a \"black hole' in an area that appears strongly hypointense in the Tl-weighted MRI and has little binding of [11C](R)-PK11195. Note, however, that a similar black hole (yellow arrowhead) adjacent to the right occipital horn of the lateral ventricle shows significant [11C](R)-PK11195 binding. (E-F) Demonstration of the definition of the MRI lesion load masks in Patient 9 (purple, T1weighted MRI lesions excluding black holes; blue, black hole only; green, gadoliniumenhancing areas; dark grey (in F), T2-weighted MRI lesions; red, areas of overlap between significantly increased [llC](R)-PKll195 binding and MRI-defined areas of pathology); yellow, areas of increased [11C](R)-PK11195 binding and no overlap with any MRI-defined pathology. (G) Average percentage volume of the MRI-defined lesions overlapping with increased [11C](R)-PK11195 binding.The red square represents Patient 8 and the red triangle Patient 6, who were both in relapse at the time of the scans. The yellow diamond represents Patient 9, who had secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. TI*, black holes. Reproduced fromBanati et al., Brain. 123:2321-37, 2000",
