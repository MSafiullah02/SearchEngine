Three conserved domains, necessary for binding of a probe and 2 flanking primers, were identified on inspection of the alignment, as current primer design software (Primer Express; Applied Biosystems) yielded no results. Two different candidate probes were defined in the middle conserved domain (region 575\u2013612). In the flanking potential primer-binding sites (regions 520\u2013548 and 625\u2013653), up to 10 different variations of oligonucleotides per site were ordered and tested experimentally in each possible combination with both of the 2 candidate probes. The most efficient combination of oligonucleotides showed 3 mismatched nucleotide (nt) residues in the probe-binding domain in HIV-1 subtype O (nucleotides 580, 586, and 587), which were compensated for by use of an additional 5\u2032-nuclease probe (see below). Because of the high degree of conservedness at the chosen oligonucleotide binding domains, no additional mismatch compensation was necessary.",

Cell-culture\u2013derived HIV-1, subtype B, strain NL4\u20133, was inoculated in fresh-frozen human plasma, diluted, and inoculated in volumes of 10 \u03bcL in 200 \u03bcL of buffer AVL. RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR testing were conducted as described below. After an initial limiting dilution series, concentrations of 1, 2, 3, and 4 log10 above the detection limit were defined as 1, 10, 100, and 1000 PCR units (PCRU), respectively. Stocks of these concentrations were generated in large volumes, divided into 10-\u03bcL aliquots, and lyophilized in vacuum glass tubes. To calibrate the stocks, the contents of each of 4 replicate glass tubes of each concentration were completely redissolved in 200 \u03bcL of buffer AVL and extracted as described above. In parallel, 4 replicate samples of human plasma containing 5000 IU of WHO HIV-1 international standard were treated like patient plasmas and tested by the ultrasensitive protocol. After obvious outliers were eliminated, we defined the lyophilized plasma samples as calibrators in the real-time PCR software and entered concentrations in terms of PCRU. The mean PCRU value obtained for the WHO standard was then used to determine a correction factor for the conversion of PCRU to WHO standard IU values. The correction factor was readjusted for each new lot of stock preparations. For up to at least 4 months, the maximum storage duration, no loss in RNA concentration was perceivable. Systematic storage studies were not done because the stability of HIV-1 and other enveloped viruses in lyophilized plasma has been confirmed several times [see, for example, Refs. (16)(17)(18)(19)(20)].",

After DNase I digestion, RNA transcripts were purified with Qiagen RNeasy columns and quantified spectrophotometrically. Results from RT-PCR with and without reverse transcriptase gave an RNA/DNA ratio of 106. The synthetic RNA was termed srLTRw. It should be noted that a much smaller RNA/DNA ratio was achieved when in vitro transcription reactions were set up according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, using linearized pLTRw DNA as the template for in vitro transcription instead of PCR products.",

With up to 160 copies of srLTRic added, a calculated 4.8 copies of HIV-1 RNA were still detectable in the same reaction in 5 of 5 parallel assays. From 320 copies of internal control onward, signal strength for HIV-1 decreased. Eighty copies of srLTRic per reaction was chosen as the working concentration, which did not interfere with the detection of 50 IU/mL HIV-1 in 24 of 24 reactions, as confirmed by testing of the WHO international standard.",

Because most commercial PCR assays do not allow qualitative testing without unnecessary extra information, which would be less expensive, high costs are a potential barrier to PMTCT. Our assay can be used for screening of more than 90 samples per run in a purely qualitative mode because of its open format. In this mode, the same reliability and sensitivity are provided as in viral-load monitoring, with the internal control to assure maximum sensitivity in each individual reaction.",

In our hands the assay has been running reliably for 3 years of routine testing. The evaluation cohorts in our study may require alternative viral-load assays in the near future. South Africa has the largest population of HIV-infected patients in the world (38)(39) and has a nationwide public service ART program underway(40)(41), requiring urgent reduction in the cost of viralload monitoring. The situation is similar in Brazil, where the absolute number of patients is high and the government is making highly active ART universally available(42)(43). Finally, India has one of the fastest growing populations of HIV-1\u2013positive individuals, and emerging ART programs will require affordable viral-load testing(44)(45). Considering the large and increasing populations of individuals infected with HIV-1 in resource-poor settings, the potential benefit of an affordable viral-load assay is enormous. The need for alternative methods is obvious, and our approach might contribute to making this aim attainable.",
