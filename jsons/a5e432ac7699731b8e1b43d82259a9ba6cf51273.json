This chain of events leads to a reduction in the elastic retraction forces that the respiratory muscles have to overcome, thereby reducing the respiratory workload. Pressure support ventilation (PSV) reduces inspiratory effort, and therefore also dyspnea, much more effectively. Also, because an inverse relation has been observed between the pressure applied with PSV and the respiratory rate, and another directly proportional relation between PSV and the circulating volume, it may also have a benefi cial effect on oxygenation. This occurs because it decreases the respiratory workload and oxygen consumption, establishing a better ventilation/perfusion ratio as the result of producing larger tidal volumes. The combination of PSV and PEEPbecause it represents an inspiratory aid and counteracts the potential intrinsic PEEP (responsible for the extra effort the inspiratory muscles have to make to overcome the pressure gradient and achieve inspiratory fl ow)-contributes to reducing the pressure and, consequently, the workload of the respiratory muscles. In clinical practice, it is accepted that the application of both PSV and PEEP can be the most appropriate ventilation method in this situation. So long as a balance is found between the optimal level of PEEP (to improve oxygenation) and the optimal level of PSV ( to reduce the activity of the accessory muscles and respiratory rate and improve thoracoabdominal synchrony) the effi cacy, at least initially, is similar to that of conventional mechanical ventilation.",

Guidelines on NIV recommend using this ventilatory system according to clinical and gasometry criteria, excluding patients for whom it might be contraindicated. Classic potential candidates for NIV are those with a PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 200 who develop progressive respiratory acidosis with pH \u2264 7.35 and have a sustained respiratory rate (RR) of more than 24 respirations per minute accompanied by active contraction of the accessory muscles or paradoxical abdominal motion. The exclusion criteria are well known. It must be remembered that to try to guarantee success patients must meet a series of criteria before NIV is applied (Table 9 .2 ). Apart from the variables predictive of NIV failure in patients with hypercapnic ARF, Antonelli et al. [ 4 , 5 ] described a series of variables in patients with hypoxemic ARF (AHRF) and those who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that identify those in whom the risk of failure is high. In AHRF patients [ 6 ] reported on a small group of patients with severe CAP, regardless of high SAPS II scores, low PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and low pH on admission, unsatisfactory gasometric response and acid-base balance, and increased respiratory rate and oxygenation index (OI) after application of NIV for 60 min. The OI (mean airway pressure \u00d7 FiO 2 \u00d7 100/PaO 2 ) is an oxygenation parameter that serves as the most reliable independent predictor of NIV failure in the latter group of patients. In a larger group of patients with H1N1 pneumonia, Masclans et al. [ 7 ] reported that involvement of one quadrant on chest radiography, hemodynamic stability, and a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score <8 are predictors of NIV success. Carrillo et al. [ 8 ] also reported that progression of the infi ltrate on chest radiography within the fi rst 24 h of NIV, a SOFA score \u2265 7 and heart rate \u2265 104 bpm, PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 144, and bicarbonate < 23 mEq/L after 60 min of NIV are predictors of NIV failure in patients with severe CAP.",

The ventilator interprets the increase in fl ow which attempt to compensate the leak as ventilation demand from the patient, triggering unwanted assisted cycles. \u2022 Time between the inspiratory effort and fl ow administration . The longer the interval, the greater is the respiratory workload.

This situation has led to discomfort and poor coordination. \u2022 Inspiratory ramp or fl ow rate . In certain situations, a steep ramp allows delivery of fl ow in less time, reducing the sensation of \"air hunger\" and onset of the auto-PEEP, thereby making it more comfortable. \u2022 Expiratory sensitivity . The patient sometimes terminates the inspiration before the respirator reaches the inspiratory fl ow-cycle threshold (in PSV, this often happens when 25 % of the peak fl ow rate is reached). This synchronization fault is called long-cycle asynchrony. In this case, an increase in the expiratory threshold sensor makes it possible to optimize the synchrony between patient and ventilator. In other instances, it may be due to the tidal volume being too high, which would have to be dealt by decreasing the PSV. Short-cycle asynchrony (when the patient's inspiratory time is longer than that of the respirator) tends to occur when chest wall/lung compliance is low or the patient is being underventilated.

Because of increased respiratory workload and refractory hypoxemia in some situations, however, it has been necessary to resort to endotracheal intubation and connection to mechanical ventilation. In view of the fact that invasive mechanical ventilation is not a risk-free technique and can cause a variety of complications-ventilator-associated pneumonia, complications related to the sedation/analgesia, damage to the trachea and lungs, organ dysfunction-over the last few years the indications for NIV have been extended based on studies that have produced strong evidence for its use [ 10 ] . It is now used systematically in patients with COPD or cardiogenic pulmonary edema, those who have undergone thoracic surgery, and immunosuppressed patients.",

For years now, nonrandomized studies have shown favorable results. Early, however, with the exception of patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, improvements were demonstrated only in oxigenation and not in the need for intubation. Wysocki et al. [ 11 ] were the fi rst to conduct a randomized trial in patients with AHRF due to various causes, discounting patients with COPD. They compared PSV and PEEP with oxygen therapy and found that NIV did not signifi cantly reduce the endotracheal intubation or mortality rates in the ICU. Upon analyzing the subgroups with PaCO 2 below or above 45 mmHg, they found that these rates were signifi cantly reduced only in those with PaCO 2 > 45 mmHg. Later, among other studies conducted, the multicenter, randomized, prospective study by Delclaux et al. [ 12 ] compared CPAP by mask versus oxygen therapy in patients with ARF and bilateral lung infi ltrates (due to various causes). Altogether, 54 and 55 % of the patients in the two groups, respectively, had pneumonia. Patients with COPD or respiratory acidosis were excluded. The authors found that although NIV improved oxygenation it did not reduce the need for endotracheal intubation or the mortality rates. Antonelli et al. [ 13 ] conducted a randomized, controlled study comparing NIV (PSV and PEEP) with invasive ventilation in immunocompetent patients with ARF (including a small proportion with pneumonia and excluding patients with COPD). They found that NIV improved oxygenation to the same extent as conventional invasive ventilation and signifi cantly reduced both the need for endotracheal intubation (although this was not the primary endpoint) and the number of cases of pneumonia and sinusitis inherent to this invasive technique. Although they found no signifi cant differences between groups regarding the mortality rate (only a trend toward increased survival in the NIV group), it is worth noting that the overall mortality rate was 28.1 % in the group assigned to NIV and 46.8 % in the invasively ventilated group. The Antonelli et al. study stimulated and gave new impetus to the interest in NIV. Since then, a number of randomized, controlled clinical trials have been conducted in both immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients with AHRF.",

The results for the COPD group were not statistically signifi cant. These results are in contrast with those of the Wysocki et al. study [ 11 ] , although it is true that the intubation rate was three times higher in the standard treatment group. This study was pioneering in that it demonstrated that NIV reduces the need for endotracheal intubation in patients with AHRF, suggesting that the benefi ts of this NIV method are not limited to patients with hypercapnic ARF. These results were subsequently corroborated by a systematic review carried out in 2004 by Keenan et al.

After observing discrepancies, however, they suggested that certain types of ARF should be carefully selected and controlled in the ICU.",

As a result, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and a number of studies in Spain [ 22 ] have advised against its use. However, Liu et al. [ 23 ] and Belenguer-Muncharaz et al. [ 24 ] , among others, published observational studies with satisfactory, promising results in patients with H1N1 infection, albeit only in a few cases. Moreover, Masclans et al. [ 7 ] published the fi rst large-scale, multicenter, observational cohort study of patients with H1N1 viral pneumonia, having excluded patients with COPD or acute pulmonary edema. NIV was applied in 25.8 % of all patients ( n = 685) and in 36 % of those ventilated. The NIV was successful in 40.6 % of patients. The variables predicting success were involvement of only one quadrant, on the chest radiography, hemodynamic stability, and SOFA score <8. Unlike in other studies, the mortality rate was the same for those in whom NIV failed and those who had been intubated from the start. Nonetheless, a number of important limitations in that study must be pointed out, such as the fact that data were not obtained regarding the severity of the ARF, the lack of standardized criteria for admission to the ICU and intubation, and failure to record the NIV technique and the time elapsed from NIV failure to intubation.",

The evidence is weak regarding its use in patients with ARF secondary to asthma, ARDS, or pneumonia. \u2022 Despite the fact that there is less evidence to support the application of NIV in patients with CAP, it can be considered in carefully selected patients but always under close monitoring in the ICU. \u2022 The greatest benefi ts are perhaps obtained when applied early in patients with early-stage infection by well-trained, experienced teams, when the appropiate modes and interfaces are used, the correct empirical antibiotics are prescribed and, probably, when intravenous corticosteroids are administered. \u2022 Adequately designed studies are required that do not include heterogeneous groups of patients with hypoxemic ARF. The patients should be exclusively those with pneumonia to determine the specifi c situations in which this ventilation method may be effective.",
