Within 4 days of the onset of a naturall_y acquired common cold, patients recorded the severity of nasal symptoms on a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging from mild or absent (0) to severe (100). The total nasal symptom score was calculated as the sum of five individual nasal symptom scores recorded (runny nose, nasal blockage, sneezing, nasal itching, and eye watering and irritation, ranging together from 0 to 500). Patients were considered to have common cold and were included in the study when the total nasal symptom score was higher than 100 and when patients presented with at least symptoms of a runny nose and nasal blockage. Allergic sensitivity was confirmed by a positive skin prick test reaction with a wheal diameter of at least 2+ (Vivodiagnost; ALK Benelux BV, Groningen, The Netherlands) or detection of specific serum IgE (Phadiatop, Pharmacia CAP System, Uppsala, Sweden) for house\u2010dust mite, grass pollen, birch pollen, or cat and dog all_ergens. All sensitized patients had mild rhinitis symptoms without asthma. None of the patients had used topical and systemic corticosteroids for the previous 4 weeks. Each patient gave informed consent, and the Rotterdam University medical ethics committee approved this nasal brush study.",

Although increased numbers of eosinophils were detected in the nose of all_ergic and nonall_ergic patients during common cold, it was only in all_ergic patients that this eosinophilia persisted into convalescence. In asthmatic patients also, prolonged eosinophilia has been found after induced common cold in bronchial (9, 15) and nasal samples (14). To our knowledge, these observations are the first which show persistent nasal eosinophilic responses in relatively mildly all_ergic subjects after naturall_y acquired common cold. There have been reports of increased nasal and bronchial hyperreactivity in subjects with all_ergic rhinitis (1). Influx of mast cells, release of mast\u2010cell products, and persistence of eosinophils in the airway mucosa may cause an increase in airway hyperreactivity in all_ergic patients compared to nonall_ergic controls.",

An increase in RANTES\u2010 and eotaxin\u2010positive cells was observed during and after common cold in both groups. However, eosinophils may display enhanced susceptibility in all_ergic individuals for the chemokines mentioned; for example, through altered chemokine receptor expression (22, 23). Other mechanisms, such as increased expression of ICAM\u20101 in inflammatory and epithelial cells (11, 24, 25, 26), or decreased apoptosis of eosinophils, may account for the prolonged eosinophilia in the nose after common cold (27). The next step will be to measure the actual quantities of chemokines produced by nasal brush cells in both all_ergic and nonall_ergic patients.",
