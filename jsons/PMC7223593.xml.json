            "text": "Inorganic polyphosphate (poly-P) is a long linear polymer of orthophosphates (Pi) with size up to 1000 Pi roots and in addition to being found in cells, this polymer chain also exists extracellularly in the blood plasma (Hassanian et al. 2017). Poly-P may act as a storage molecule for energetic phosphate, calcium chelator or other divalent cations, as an opposing ion for amino acids in vacuoles, as a regulator of intracellular levels of adenylate nucleotides through inhibition (Lorenz et al. 2012; Schr\u00f6der and M\u00fcller 2012). Adenylate kinase, used as a phosphate donor for some glucose kinases, or may play a role in apoptosis or response of cells to osmotic pressure and pH pressure. Recent studies have shown also the role of poly-P in bone formation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, metastatic tumors, blood clots, and the regulation of inflammation (Ardeshirylajimi et al. 2018; Dedkova and Blatter 2014; Solesio et al. 2016). These poly-P roles are mediated by stimulation of intracellular signaling pathways. Poly-P activates receptors on cell membranes such as integrin, fibroblast growth factors (FGF), P2Y1 and also induces nitric oxide synthase expression. By inducing FGF, it activates ERK/p38 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated signaling (Hassanian et al. 2016). It also confirmed that polyP activates the mTOR signaling pathway in cancer cells and the Wnt signaling pathway in osteogenesis. One of the most important roles of poly-P is in the transport of membrane ions, where, the channel formed by poly-P and calcium ion and Polyhydroxybutyrate (polyP/Ca2+/PHB) plays an important role in increasing membrane permeability (Dedkova and Blatter 2014).",

            "text": "The bladder smooth muscle can be disturbed by many factors that can change people\u2019s lifestyle and disrupt their routine life. No definitive treatment for these disorders has been reported so far, and current therapies only partially alleviate some of the patients\u2019 problems and do not completely cure them (Franco 2012; Hoag and Gani 2015; Schmidt 2008). In this because, scientists have tried to use tissue engineering (TE) for introduce alternative therapies for bladder disorders. TE is the science of designing and producing new tissues for damaged organs and tissues or repairing tissue lesions and improving organ function through the design and fabrication of 3D scaffolds that can be cultured within cells. There are three key factors in TE: signaling macromolecules, stem cell, and scaffold as an alternative extracellular matrix (ECM) (Griffith and Naughton 2002; Lanza et al. 2011). Scaffolds are used as a synthetic cellular ECM to generate growth signals and guide cell differentiation and development of new tissue. Space and mechanical stability created by scaffold through transverse connections can be very useful in repairing irregular defects and formation of new tissue (Amani et al. 2019). Polymeric nano-fibers can be prepared in a variety of ways, including phase separation, synthetic molding, self-assembly, drawing, and electrospinning (Alghoraibi and Alomari 2018). Electrospinning is one of the most widely used, because is a relatively simple way to produce nanoscale or sub-micron scale fibrous scaffolds that are morphologically similar to the natural ECM (Wang et al. 2009). Electrospun fiber matrices can have a high specific surface area due to the possibility of creating very thin diameters and thus can efficiently release biomolecules (Subbiah et al. 2005). Also, the loose bond between the fibers can be useful for tissue growth and cell migration. In addition, electrospinning is applicable to all soluble polymers, these polymers are chemically changeable and can also be added to bases of particles, including carbon and complex particles such as proteins, growth factors and enzymes (Sill and von Recum 2008). Thus, electrospun nanofibrous scaffolds, in addition to acting as a synthetic ECM underlying scaffolds, they can also serve as carriers for the controlled delivery of an active biomolecule. In this technology, the scaffold can release a specific factor for a certain period of time, which can exert its biological function upon release. This will both slowly discharge the required amount of material in place and reduce the wastage of additional costs (Khalf and Madihally 2017).",

            "text": "Tissue engineering structures designed to repair damaged tissue can include three parts, a cell, a scaffold and a biologically active factor that can accelerate the process of cells differentiation into the target tissue (Hosseinkhani et al. 2014). Depending on the target tissue, sections can be changed. Recently, several studies have confirmed the possibility of bladder smooth muscle remodeling using engineered constructs made from native and synthetic biomaterials cultured with cells in vitro (Atala 2011; Corona et al. 2013; Drewa et al. 2006). In this project, a novel system of electrospun bioactive scaffold is presented for the bladder tissue engineering with the aim of supporting in vitro SMC differentiation. It was demonstrated that RhoA and AKT pathways play a critical role in SMC differentiation process (Mack 2011), on the other hand Hassanian et al. were also reported that poly-P has a great role in activation of the mTOR signaling where the interaction of poly-P with RAGE and P2Y1 activates mTORC1 pathway by PI3K/AKT activation (Hassanian et al. 2016). In this because, we decided to incorporate poly-P as a bioactive molecules in the biodegradable PLGA/PU nanofibrous scaffold, since poly-P can released continuously from the nanofibers and can trigger mTOR pathway in the cells while cultured on the nanofibrous scaffold. This release along with SMC induction medium can enhance the efficacy of the SMC differentiation. The results achieved at this study demonstrated that polyP incorporating in PLGA/PU nanofibers didn\u2019t have any significant change in the scaffold\u2019s structural and morphological characteristics, while PLGA/PU scaffold\u2019s elongation at break, protein adsorption, cell adhesion, wettability and biocompatibility were increased after incorporating with poly-P. In agree with our results, it was demonstrated previously the presence of the poly-P cases to increase in cell proliferation and survival (Hosseini et al. 2019; Rao et al. 2009). In following, AT-MSCs were cultured on the PLGA/PU/poly-P and PLGA/PU nanofibrous scaffolds and TCPS as a control under SMC differentiation medium to investigate SMC supportive capacity of the fabricated scaffolds. Obtained results at the gene and protein levels demonstrated that fabricated PLGA/PU has a great SMC supportive capacity when AT-MSCs cultured on it compared to the TCPS. In addition, this supportive potential of PLGA/PU from SMC differentiation of AT-MSCs was significantly increased when these fibers filled by poly-P that can be related to the polyP activity in triggering mTOR and AKT signal pathways that are involved in SMC modulation (Martin et al. 2004; Mourani et al. 2004). In agreement with our results, mTOR signaling has been shown to be involved in regulating cell growth and proliferation in response to cellular environments, including adequate nutrients, energy, and oxygen (Martin and Blenis 2002; Sarbassov et al. 2005). In addition, Rzucidlo et al. (2007) demonstrated that AKT signal pathway play a critical role in vascular SMC differentiation.",

Since there is no definitive cure for bladder disease due to bladder wall functional disorders, the use of this scaffold and poly-P may be helpful in assisting such patients when used as a bio-implant in the treatment of bladder smooth muscle damages. In addition, while poly-P incorporated in PLGA/PU nanofibers, this supportive property will be increased according to the results presented at this study. It can be concluded that, based on the poly-P role in mTOR/AKT signal pathways and the role of these pathways in SMC differentiation, it could be related to the synergistic effect of these two parts of our fabricated scaffolds including scaffold topography and incorporated poly-P as a biological active molecule.",
