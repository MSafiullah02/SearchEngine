Health communicators need more information on misinformation and the social media environment during a fear-inducing disease outbreak to improve communication practices. The purpose of this study was to describe the content of Ebola-related tweets with a specific focus on misinformation, political content, health related content, risk framing, and rumors.",

A randomly selected subset of 3639 (5%) tweets were evaluated for inclusion. We analyzed the 3113 tweets that meet inclusion criteria using public health trained human coders to assess tweet characteristics (joke, opinion, discord), veracity (true, false, partially false), political context, risk frame, health context, Ebola specific messages, and rumors. We assessed the proportion of tweets with specific content using descriptive statistics and chi-squared tests.",

Twenty-five percent were related to politics, 28% contained content that provoked reader response or promoted discord, 42% contained risk elevating messages and 72% were related to health. The most frequent rumor mentioned focused on government conspiracy. When comparing tweets with true information to tweets with misinformation, a greater percentage of tweets with misinformation were political in nature (36% vs 15%) and contained discord-inducing statements (45% vs 10%). Discord-inducing statements and political messages were both significantly more common in tweets containing misinformation compared with those without(p < 0.001).",

Misinformation contradicts the best expert evidence available at the time and can lead to individual misperception or \"factual beliefs that are false or contradict the best available evidence in public domain.\" [1, 2] The emergence of new communication platforms and access-enabling technology, such as social media and cell phones, that connect networks of people who often share similar opinions and cultural beliefs, has exacerbated and amplified this problem [3, 4] . Misinformation is not limited to the political realm, where it is widely recognized, but has emerged as an important issue in public health-related messaging and potential barrier to effective disease outbreak preparedness and response [5] . Common examples of health misinformation during public health events or emergencies include false remedies for illness, incorrect information on disease transmission, or allegations that the disease is associated with a government conspiracy [6, 7] . Characterization of health-related misinformation is needed to develop evidence-based risk communication efforts during public health emergencies. In particular, it is necessary to develop more effective strategies to manage misinformation during infectious disease emergencies based on an understanding of typical trends in health-related misinformation.",

Moreover, social media may increase its effects, serving as both a source of misinformation and a catalyst for its dissemination [12] [13] [14] . Some research has indicated that social media may lead to selective exposure to specific types of content, driving possible \"echo chambers\" and the formation of homogenous clusters is a primary driver of information diffusion [15] . Other studies assessing this phenomenon note, however, that echo chambers may not be as present depending on how diverse exposure is to different forms of media [16] . False information can spread easily over social media platforms. For example, in Twitter rumor cascades, false news reaches more people than true information [4] . Social media is now one of the key sources in how many people receive their health news and [17, 18] , as such, has a key role in the spread of health misinformation.",

Despite very low case counts within the United States (US), widespread fear and media attention contributed to dissemination of US Ebola-related misinformation [7] . Coverage from traditional media sources was dispersed on social media, where it joined a mixture of factual and false information [7, [24] [25] [26] . News and social media content during the Ebola epidemic has been explored both within West African [25, 27, 28] , American contexts [7, 24] , and European contexts [29] . Research focusing on Ebolarelated misinformation in the West African context identified common rumors including false treatments; misinformation about the intentions and motives of healthcare workers treating Ebola patients; and rumors about the Ebola epidemic being a hoax [27, 28] . Such rumors may have impeded the ability for public health responders to communicate to communities about effective prevention and control methods. Research on Ebola-related misinformation in a predominantly Western context found that rumors such as the existence of \"Ebola zombies\", misperceptions about the disease transmission, or inaccurate information about experimental Ebola vaccines was common, potentially leading to fear, uncertainty, and confusion amongst the public [7] . Such literature has provided a high-level characterization of the general types of correct and incorrect Ebola-related information circulating on social media. Further research is needed, however, to understand specific characterizations and content of correct, false, and partially false information, and possible trends in the existence political or discord-inducing messages. The goal of this research is to address such gaps in the literature by providing an in-depth analysis of twitter content, particularly misinformation, in the context of an outbreak that generated high levels of fear and attention amongst the US population. Specifically, we aim to describe the content of Ebola-related tweets with a specific focus on the characteristics of misinformation, political content, health related content, risk framing, and rumors. While each public health event is different, this research may provide insight into the possible social media environment during a future epidemic.",

All tweets in the dataset represented original published content as determined by the unique Tweet identifier assigned by the Twitter API.

The final coding instrument included dichotomous yes/ no codes assessing tweet characteristics (e.g. joke, opinion, discord), veracity (true, false, partially false), political context, risk frame [31] , health context, Ebola specific messages [30, 32] , rumors [7] , and 23 hashtags previously identified in literature as potentially suspicious or associated with misinformation (Additional File 1) [25] . Two authors (DH and MT) coded tweets using a Google survey form. The extensive piloting process indicated a need for collaborative review of some tweets that were challenging to code. As a result, a system in which three authors (DH, MT, and TKS) reviewed those tweets in question was established and continued throughout the coding process. Two authors (DH and MT) assessed interrater reliability for each dichotomous yes/no item by each coding the same random sample of 200 tweets. All but one item had kappa values of 0.79 of higher and therefore met conventional standards for adequate reliability [33] . The remaining itemstatement in support of government -did not have a satisfactory Kappa value but remained in the coding instrument because it was very rare and showed 99.5% agreement.",

Overall, the percentage of tweets with key characteristics, including misinformation and discord was only slightly less in tweets that were more frequently retweeted. Among non-joke tweets, nearly 7% of those with over 100 retweets (n = 15) contained misinformation, compared to 9% (n = 175) of tweets that contained at least 2 retweets. Additionally, about 23% (n = 53) of tweets with over 100 retweets contained discord-inducing messages, compared to 25% (n = 230) of tweets with over 10 retweets and 28% (n = 521) of tweets with at least 2 retweets. Similarly, the frequency of tweets that were political in nature and were opposed to government decreased only slightly and only after exceeding 100 retweets (56% among tweets with over 1 (n = 278) and 10 retweets (n = 135); 50% among tweets with at least 100 retweets (n = 24)).",

Ebola response activities within the US and the time period of interest in this study corresponded with the lead up to US midterm elections (which occurred Nov 4, 2014) . This temporal overlap may have contributed to the political content found in many tweets, particularly with respect to discourse on travel bans and quarantine procedures. Furthermore, the politicization of this health issue extended beyond discussion about the disease itself, and often touched on other contentious political issues in the US, such as immigration, general health care policy, and government spending. These findings support previous research tying the acceptance of information and perceived risk perception with whether such information would align with a person's political identity [8] . The intersection of health misinformation with political discourse may have also contributed to Ebola response efforts being viewed as partisan topics. As other researchers have noted [8, 10] , when a statement is associated with a particular conservative or liberal viewpoint, readers that align with that political ideology may be less likely to critically assess the truth to the statement, which posed a challenge for promoting evidence-based policies in public health response.",

Additionally, a substantial proportion of these tweets were framed in ways that could promote discord or bait readers into responding.

Published literature on misinformation during the H1N1 pandemic have also shown that misinformation circulating during pandemics often elicits lack of trust in government or traditional institutions [40] . Notably, the prevalence of tweet characteristics of concern, including the presence of misinformation, discord-inducing statements, and political messaging, remained relatively constant even among highly retweeted content. Given the relationship between political content and misinformation, another potential approach to ensure that accurate information is included in political discourse is to provide political leaders with frequently updated disease information fact sheets. Federal health officials, for example the Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs and Assistant Secretary for Legislation, can provide frequent updates and concise information to policymakers and political staff members to ensure that science-based health information is easily available. Furthermore, practitioners, policymakers, and the national security community should be aware of the potential usage of public health emergencies to create discord amongst the public during public health emergencies and strive to reduce these effects. Experience with outbreak emergencies has shown the deleterious effects of misinformation and diminishing trust [5] .",

Furthermore, driven by public interest, mass media may sensationalize or exaggerate the risk of disease in a population, which could increase risk perception and risk-elevating messages on social media [24] . Although appropriate levels of risk perception in situations that warrant public attention, investment in protective actions, and policy intervention is necessary, messages that elevate public perception of risk situations that do not warrant high levels of public concern are problematic.

Public private partnerships between social media companies and public health agencies to promote public health messages is also an important component in combating misinformation, as observed in the partnership between the World Health Organization and social media companies to combat the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) misinformation [42, 43] . As governments and global health organizations become increasingly aware of the dangers of misinformation in both health and political sectors, more research will need to be done to ensure that strategies to reduce misinformation are effective and do not infringe of the spread of true information or the ability of members of the public to speak freely. Research assessing the effects of correcting health misinformation has shown varied results. While some studies have indicated that correction of certain misinformation by trusted sources can help reduce misperceptions, others indicate correction can sometimes have limited impact or even contribute to further misperceptions in certain circumstances due to factors such as the perceived trustworthiness of the source and whether corrective information conflicts with the social or political identity of the individual [44, 45] .

Frequent discussions prevented coders from deviating from agreed upon code definitions over the course of the coding process. Although interrater agreement for coders was high, double coding was conducted on a limited 5% of the sample. Another potential limitation is our decision not to limit the study sample to US geotagged tweets due to concerns about potential bias this may have introducedthat users who allowed geotagging may have been different from other types of Twitter users.
