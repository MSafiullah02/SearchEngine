Prevention of disease by breaking the chain of transmission has traditionally been the main purpose of infectious disease epidemiology. While this goal remains the same, the picture of infectious diseases is changing. New pathogens are identified and already known disease agents are changing their behavior. The world population is aging; more people develop underlying disease conditions and are therefore more susceptible to certain infectious diseases or have long term sequelae after being infected.",

To prevent diseases it is important to understand the causative agents, risk factors and circumstances that lead to a specific disease. This is even more important for infectious disease prevention, since simple interventions may break the chain of transmission. Preventing cardiovascular diseases or cancer is much more difficult because it usually requires multiple long term interventions requiring lifestyle changes and behavior modification, which are difficult to achieve. In 1900, the American Commission of Yellow Fever, headed by Walter Reed, was sent to Cuba. The commission showed that the infective agent was transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. This information was used by the then Surgeon General of the US Army William Gorgas, to clean up the 200 year old focus of yellow fever in Havana by using mosquito proofing or oiling of the larval habitat, dusting houses with pyrethrum powder and isolating suspects under a mosquito net. This rapidly reduced the number of cases in Havana from 310 in 1900 to 18 in 1902 (Goodwin 1996) .",

The HA protein is able to agglutinate red blood cells (hence its name). This protein is important as it is a major antigen for eliciting neutralizing antibodies. Antigenic drift is a minor change in surface antigens that result from point mutations in a gene segment. Antigenic drift may result in epidemics, since incomplete protection remains from past exposures to similar viruses. Antigenic shift is a major change in one or both surface antigens (H and|or N) that occurs at varying intervals. Antigenic shifts are probably due to genetic recombination (an exchange of a gene segment) between influenza A viruses, usually those that affect humans and birds. An antigenic shift may result in a worldwide pandemic if the virus can be efficiently transmitted from person to person.",

On the other hand exogenous origin theory postulates that reinfection plays a role in the development of tuberculosis. The immunity provided by the initial infection is not strong enough to prevent another exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and a new infection leads to disease. In countries with low tuberculosis transmission, for example the Netherlands, most strains have unique RFLP fingerprints. Each infection is unique and there are hardly any clusters of infections resulting from a common source. Most cases are the result of reactivation. This is in contrast with areas of high endemicity where long chains of transmission can be identified with few RFLP fingerprinting patterns (Alland et al. 1994) .

Regulations on mandatory reporting are often difficult to enforce. Voluntary compliance by the institution's personnel is necessary. Reporting may be done in writing, by phone or electronically in the most advanced system. Since most infectious diseases are confirmed by a laboratory test, reporting by the laboratory may be more reliable. The advantage of laboratory reporting is the ability to computerize the reporting system. Computer programs may be set up to automatically report a defined set of tests and results.

Females of reproductive age are the victims because of pelvic invasive disease (PID) and sterility.

There are certain common steps for outbreak investiga-tions as shown in Table 1 .6. However, the chronology and priorities assigned to each phase of the investigation have to be decided individually, based on the circumstances of the suspected outbreak and information available at the time. Another way to detect an increase of cases is if the surveillance system of reportable infectious diseases reveals an unusually high number of people with the same diagnosis over a certain time period at different health care facilities. Outbreaks of benign diseases like self-limited diarrhea are often not detected because people are not seeking medical attention and therefore medical services are not aware of them. Furthermore, early stages of a disease outbreak are often undetected because single cases are diagnosed sporadically. It is not until a certain threshold is passed, that it becomes clear that these cases are related to each other through a common exposure or secondary transmission. Depending on the infectious disease agent, there can be a sharp or a gradual increase of number of cases. It is sometimes difficult to differentiate between sporadic cases and the early phase of an outbreak. In the 2001 St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE) outbreak in Louisiana, the number of SLE cases increased from 9 to 18 between week one and two and then the numbers gradually decreased over the next 9 weeks to a total of 63 cases (Jones et al. 2002) . 2. After the initial report is received, it is important to collect and document basic information: Contact information of persons affected, a good and thorough event description, names and diagnosis of hospitalized persons (and depending on the presumptive diagnosis their underlying conditions and travel history), laboratory test results and other useful information to get a complete picture and to confirm the initial story of the suspected outbreak. It also might be necessary to collect more biological specimens such as food items and stool samples for further laboratory testing. 3.

Other reasons not to investigate might be that this type of outbreak occurs regularly every summer or that it is only an increase in number of reported cases which are not related to each other. On the other hand, however, there should be no time delay in starting an investigation if there is an opportunity to prevent more cases or the potential to identify a system failure which can be caused, for example, by poor food preparation in a restaurant or poor infection control practices in a hospital or to prevent future outbreaks by acquiring more knowledge of the epidemiology of the agent involved. Additional reasons to investigate include the interest of the media, politicians and the public in the disease cluster and the pressure to provide media updates on a regularly basis. Another fact to consider is that outbreak investigations are good training opportunities for newly hired epidemiologists. Sometimes lack of data and lack of sufficient background information make it difficult to decide early on if there is an outbreak or not. The best approach then is to assume that it is an outbreak until proven otherwise. 4. Prevention of more cases is the most important goal in outbreak investigations and therefore a rapid evaluation of the situation is necessary. If there are precautionary measures to be recommended to minimize the impact of the outbreak and the spread to more persons, they should be implemented before a thorough investigation is completed. Most likely control measures implemented by public health professionals in foodborne outbreaks are: Recall or destruction of contaminated food items, Restriction of infected food handlers from food preparation, Correction of any deficiency in food preparation or conservation.",

The most popular books for public health professionals include the \"Red Book\" (American Academy of Pediatrics 2003), the \"Control of Communicable Diseases Manual\" from the American Public Health Association (APHA 2000) or other infectious disease epidemiology books as well as the CDC website (www.cdc.gov). If the disease of interest is a reportable disease or a disease where surveillance data are available, baseline incidence rates can be calculated. Then a comparison is made to determine if the reported numbers constitute a real increase or not. Furthermore, the seasonal and geographical distribution of the disease is important as well as the knowledge of risk factors. Many infectious diseases show a seasonal pattern such as Rotavirus or Neisseria meningitides. For example in suspected outbreaks where cases are associated with raw oyster consumption, the investigator should know that in the US Gulf states Vibrio cases increase in the summer months because the water conditions are optimal for the growth of the bacteria in water and in seafood. This kind of information will help to determine if the case numbers show a true increase and if it seems likely to be a real outbreak. 6. For certain diseases, numbers are not important. Depending on the severity of the disease, its transmissibility and its natural occurrence, certain diseases should raise a red flag for every health care professional and even a single case should warrant a thorough public health investigation. For example a single confirmed case of a rabid dog in a city (potential dog to dog transmission within a highly populated area), a case of dengue hemorrhagic fever or a presumptive case of smallpox would immediately trigger an outbreak investigation. 7. Sometimes an increase of case numbers is artificial and not due to a real outbreak. In order to differentiate between an artificial and a natural increase in numbers, the following changes have to be taken into consideration: Alterations in the surveillance system, A new physician who is interested in the disease and therefore more likely to diagnose or report the disease, A new health officer strengthening the importance of reporting, New procedures in reporting (from paper to web based reporting), Enhanced awareness or publicity of a certain disease that might lead to increased laboratory testing, New diagnostic tests, A new laboratory, An increase in susceptible population such as a new summer camp.",

The slow progression of symptoms and misdiagnosis of the dispersed cases made it very difficult to link these cases and identify the source of the outbreak (CDC 1985 (CDC , 1987 . 9. The purpose of a case definition is to standardize the identification and counting of the number of cases. The case definition is a standard set of criteria and is not a clinical diagnosis. In most outbreaks the case definition has components of person, place and time, such as the following: Persons with symptoms of X and Y after eating at the restaurant Z between Date1 and Date2. The case definition should be broad enough to get most of the true cases but not too narrow so that true cases will not be misclassified as controls. A good method is to analyze the data, identify the frequency of symptoms and include symptoms that are more reliable than others. For example, diarrhea and vomiting are more specific than nausea and headache in the case definition of a food related illness. 10. What kind of information is necessary to be collected? It is sufficient to have a simple database with basic demographic information such as name, age, sex and information for contacting the patient. More often, date of reporting and date of onset of symptoms are also important. Depending on the outbreak and the potential exposure or transmission of the agent involved further variables such as school, grade of student or occupation in adults might be interesting and valuable. 11. During an outbreak investigation it is important to identify additional cases that may not have been known or were not reported. There are several approaches: Interview known cases and ask them if they know of any other friends or family members with the same signs or symptoms, Obtain a mailing list of frequent customers in an event where a restaurant is involved, Set up an active surveillance with physicians or emergency departments, Call laboratories and ask for reports of suspected and confirmed cases.",

After finding additional cases, entering them in the database and organizing them, the investigator should try to get a better understanding of the situation by performing some basic descriptive epidemiology techniques such as sorting the data by time, place and person. For a better visualization of the data, an epidemic or \"epi\" curve should be graphed. The curve shows the number of cases by date or time of onset of symptoms. This helps to understand the nature and dynamic of the outbreak as well as to get a better understanding of the incubation period if the time of exposure is known. It also helps to determine whether the outbreak had a single exposure and no secondary transmission (single peak) or if there is a continuous source and ongoing transmission. Figures 1.2 and 1.3 show \"epi\" curves of two different outbreaks: a foodborne outbreak in a school in Louisiana, and the number of WNV human cases in Louisiana in the 2002 outbreak, respectively. Sometimes it is useful to plot the cases on a map to get a better idea of the nature and the source of an outbreak. Mapping may be useful to track the spread by water (see John Snow's cholera map) or by air or even a person to person transmission. If a contaminated food item was the culprit, food distribution routes with new cases identified may be helpful. Maps, however, should be taken with caution and carefully interpreted. For example, WNV cases are normally mapped by residency but do not take into account that people might have been exposed or bitten by an infective mosquito far away from where they live. For outbreak investigations, spot maps are usually more useful than rate maps or maps of aggregate data. Depending on the outbreak it might be useful to characterize the outbreak by persons' demographics such as age, sex, address and occupation or health status. Are the cases at increased susceptibility or at high risk of infection? These kinds of variables might give the investigator a good idea if the exposure is not yet known. For typical foodborne outbreaks however, demographic information is not very useful because the attack rates will be independent of age and sex. More details on methods used in descriptive epidemiology are given in Chap. I.3 of this handbook. 13. Based on the results of basic descriptive epidemiology and the preliminary investigation, some hypotheses should be formulated in order to identify the cause of the outbreak. A hypothesis will be most likely formulated such as \"those who attended the luncheon and ate the chicken salad are at greater risk than those who attended and did not eat the chicken salad\". It is always easier to find something after knowing what to look for and therefore a hypothesis should be used as a tool. However, the epidemiologist should be flexible enough to change the hypothesis if the data do not support it. If data clues are leading in another direction, the hypothesis should be reformulated such as \"those who attended the luncheon and ate the baked chicken are at greater risk than those who attended and did not eat the baked chicken\". To verify or deny hypotheses, measures of risk association such as the relative risk (RR) or the odds ratio (OR) have to be calculated (as described in Chaps. I.2, I.5, and I.6 of this handbook). The CDC has developed the software program 'EpiInfo' which is easy to use in outbreak investigations, and, even more importantly, free of charge. It can be downloaded from the CDC website (http:||www.cdc.gov|epiinfo|). Measures of association, however, should be carefully interpreted; even a highly significant measure of association can not give enough evidence of the real culprit or the contaminated food item. The measure of association is only as good and valid as the data. Most people have recall problems when asked what they ate, when they ate and when their symptoms started. Even more biases or misclassifications of cases and controls can hide an association. A more confident answer comes usually from the laboratory samples from both human samples and food items served at time of exposure. Agents isolated from both food and human samples that are identified as the same subtype, in addition to data results supporting the laboratory findings, are the best evidence beyond reasonable doubt. 14. As the last step in an outbreak investigation, the epidemiologist writes a final report on the outbreak and communicates the results and recommendations to the public health agency and facilities involved. In the US, public health departments also report foodborne outbreaks electronically to CDC via a secure web based reporting system, the Electronic Foodborne Outbreak Reporting System (EFORS).",

Because it is immediately apparent to those in the local group such as the group of friends who ate at the restaurant or the students' parents, public health authorities are normally notified early in the outbreak while most of the cases are still symptomatic. Epidemiologists can start early on with their investigation and therefore have a much better chance to collect food eaten and stool samples of cases with gastroenteritis for testing and also to detect the etiologic agent in both of them. In a 2001 school outbreak in Louisiana, eighty-seven persons (sixty-seven students and twenty faculty members) experienced abdominal cramps after eating at the school's annual \"Turkey Day\" the day before. Stool specimens and the turkey with the gravy were both positive for Clostridium perfringens with the same pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pattern (Merlos 2002) . The inspection of the school cafeteria revealed several food handling violations such as storing, cooling and reheating of the food items served.

A cluster sampling design was used to obtain a representative number of households. The area was not stratified because of its homogeneity. Census blocks were grouped so that each cluster contained a minimum of 50 households. The probability of including an individual cluster was determined by the proportion of houses selected in that cluster and the number of persons participating given the number of adults in the household.
