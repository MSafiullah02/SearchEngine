Beginning in 1989, they identified 52 infants who were receiving treatment in hospital for RSV bronchiolitis and assessed their disease progression until they were 13 years old. The patients were matched with 93 healthy individuals of similar age and sex. When the children were 7\u00b75 years old, those with a family history of both asthma and bronchiolitis had high rates of asthma (38%; 8 of 21 patients) compared with those with a family history of asthma but not bronchiolitis (none of 27 patients).

This gene\u2013environment idea is lent support by a large epidemiological study15 done in Tennessee, USA, in which investigators noted that infants who were born roughly 120 days before the time of the year at which RSV prevalence was at its peak had the highest rate of admissions to hospital for wheezing illnesses. Follow-up revealed that the timing of birth with respect to the peak of the winter bronchiolitis season was also associated with a high risk for developing asthma. These findings suggest that infants who are at the highest risk for severe viral bronchiolitis are also most likely to develop asthma. Moreover, they suggest that several viral wheezing illnesses during infancy contribute to the development of asthma. At least two prospective birth cohort studies16, 17 have also documented an association between wheezing illnesses due to RSV infection in early life and the subsequent expression of persistent wheezing and asthma when a child begins school.",

Third, when HRV or other viruses are detected, the viral load can be measured; large viral loads will lead to a more symptomatic infection and a greater likelihood of asthma exacerbation compared with small viral loads.26 Finally, to differentiate between the many HRV strains has now become possible and, as will be discussed later, this ability has led to the discovery of a new species, which might be strongly associated with wheezing illnesses and asthma.25, 27, 28\n",

These children had at least one parent with asthma or allergic disease. The Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study was initiated in 1998, with 289 children enrolled between 1998 and 2000. Nasal lavage specimens were obtained from the children at well child visits during their first year of life\u2014at 1, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months of age\u2014and whenever they had a symptomatic respiratory infection. For the next 5 years, nasal lavage specimens were taken only when a child had symptomatic respiratory illnesses. When the children were 3 years of age, the investigators assessed the frequency of persistent wheezing.30 Then at age 6 years, the 259 children remaining in the study were tested for asthma. With this study design (figure 2\n), the investigators were able to determine associations between respiratory illnesses with early life wheezing and the eventual development of asthma. The diagnoses of asthma were determined independently by four clinician investigators, in a blinded fashion and on the basis of fulfilling several clinical criteria: diagnosis of asthma by a physician; frequent albuterol or asthma-controller medication use; a step-up plan during illness; with or without oral prednisone use for an asthma exacerbation.16 On the basis of these prestudy criteria, 28% (n=73) of the children were diagnosed with asthma at age 6 years.",

Aeroallergen sensitisation without wheezing in the first year of life and wheezing without sensitisation were both associated with an increased risk for asthma at 6 years of age. The frequency of asthma was highest in infants with both sensitisation and HRV-related wheezing. Aeroallergen sensitisation did not increase the risk for asthma if an infant had wheezing in the first year of life. When these comparisons were made in the third year of life, HRV-related wheezing had a greater effect on asthma risk (25\u00b76 [8\u00b72\u201379\u00b76]) than had aeroallergen sensitisation (3\u00b74 [7\u00b77\u20136\u00b79]). Again, there was no evidence that aeroallergen sensitisation at age 3 years changed the association between HRV-related wheezing illnesses and the development of asthma at 6 years of age. Therefore, during the early years of life, HRV respiratory infections seem to be the dominant risk factor associated with the diagnosis of asthma at age 6 years.",

HRV has been confirmed as the virus that contributes most to these developments, which raises the question: do HRVs cause asthma? Since HRV infections are so widespread in the general population, it seems unlikely that they do. There are several hypotheses that associate severe HRV-related illnesses with recurrent wheezing and asthma. First, asthma might be fundamentally associated with dysfunctional antiviral immune responses, such as deficient production of interferons.26, 31 Second, there might be environmental factors (eg, tobacco smoke exposure) that promote severe HRV-related illnesses, recurrent wheezing, and asthma. Third, specific viral strains could be more likely to cause asthma. These hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive and will be discussed later in this Review.",

Olenec and colleagues25 sampled nasal secretions every week from a group of children with asthma and noted that the relation between infection and resulting illness varied with the presence of allergic sensitisation. Infection caused upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms that were of greater duration and severity in children with allergic asthma than in those with non-allergic asthma. Furthermore, viral infections were more likely to cause a loss of asthma control in children with allergic asthma than in those with non-allergic asthma.

Wark and colleagues30 used bronchoscopy to obtain bronchial epithelial cells for culture from individuals with and without asthma. These cells are highly relevant to an individual's susceptibility to infection because they are the primary site for an HRV infection in the lower airway. The investigators reported HRV-16 replication to be increased and interferon-\u03b2 responses to this virus to be diminished in bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic patients (figure 5\n). The addition of interferon-\u03b2 to the HRV bronchial epithelial cell cultures from asthmatic individuals reduced virus replication. Similarly, Contoli and co-workers31 recorded decreased interferon-\u03bb responses in bronchoalveolar airway cells from the same asthmatic individuals. Additionally, after inoculation with HRV-16, a fall in lung function (ie, forced expiratory volume in one second) was inversely proportional to interferon-\u03bb generation previously noted (figure 6\n). These data suggest that airway cells in some asthma patients have defective antiviral responses, as evidenced by reduced generation of interferons to HRV-16.",

For example, Heymann and co-workers8 investigated the presence of viral respiratory tract infections in infants and children admitted for wheezing and the relation of the patient's atopic status to their asthma episode. In children aged 3\u201318 years, there was a distinct seasonal pattern, with the largest percentage of children admitted between September and November. For the children aged 3 years and older, HRV was the predominant respiratory virus detected in those admitted for wheezing (61% vs 21% in controls). Additionally, the wheezing children had substantially higher serum IgE values than did healthy controls (geometric means: 386 IU/mL vs 38 IU/mL), and 84% of the children with wheezing were sensitised to at least one aeroallergen in their test panel. These data suggest that allergic sensitisation, at least of children, is an important risk factor for wheezing with an HRV infection, and that IgE-dependent responses might also contribute to the development of wheezing with a cold. Additional studies in children and adults indicate that allergic individuals who are exposed to allergens have the highest risk for virus-induced wheezing and asthma exacerbations.60, 61\n",

In Canada, the sharp increases in emergency department visits for acute asthma and admissions for childhood asthma have been predictable year-to-year. As these investigators point out, aeroallergens, air pollution, and interactions with climate can affect asthma exacerbations. To test the hypothesis that asthma exacerbations at the beginning of the school year were related to viral respiratory infections, these researchers assessed children presenting to an emergency department during 3 weeks in September along with community-recruited children with equally severe asthma who did not require acute care.62 For 62% (n=52) of the children with asthma visiting emergency departments, a respiratory virus was identified by PCR detection methods; respiratory viruses were identified in only 41% (n=150) of controls. Detection of respiratory viruses this frequently during September probably indicates a high prevalence of the virus at this time of the year. As the researchers note, the beginning of the school term is often associated with high stress levels and increased concentrations of aeroallergens in the environment. They conclude that although a viral infection can be the immediate trigger for an asthma exacerbation, these factors are likely to act together to cause the September epidemic.",

On one hand, viral infections weaken the barrier function of the airway epithelium, which can lead to enhanced absorption of allergens and irritants across the airway wall and increase allergic inflammation.64 On the other hand, HRV replication in vitro is greater in damaged epithelium than in undamaged epithelium, which implies that allergen-induced damage to airway epithelium could promote viral replication and lead to severe clinical illness.65, 66 This notion could also apply to pollutants and explain why exposure to toxic agents (eg, tobacco smoke, nitrogen dioxide) also increases the risk of viral wheeze.67, 68 Additionally, airway epithelium in asthma has distinct features, including increased numbers of mucus-secreting goblet cells; there is laboratory evidence that HRV replication is enhanced in these cells.69\n",

Both HRV infection and allergic inflammation induce epithelial cells to secrete thymic stromal lymphopoietin, a cytokine that can act on a various types of cell, including dendritic cells, to promote Th2 differentiation, thereby enhancing allergic inflammation.72 Studies in animals suggest that biased innate immune responses to respiratory viruses encountered in early life could establish overproduction of key cytokines such as interleukin-13, leading to suboptimum antiviral responses, an increased risk for respiratory allergies, and changes in airway structure to promote asthma.73\n",

Thus, underlying allergic disease seems to be either a risk factor for wheezing with a cold or might lay the foundations that enable the respiratory virus to interact with airway epithelium and start the processes leading to an asthma exacerbation. Determination of these interactive events promises to provide insight not only to mechanisms of asthma provoked by respiratory viruses, but also clues to more effective treatment.",

Over the past two decades we have developed our understanding and appreciation of the complexity of this association in terms of altered antiviral responses in asthma and the possibility that newly recognised HRV groups are important to this process. Many issues remain, including the patterns of inflammation that arise from respiratory viruses, the mechanisms of airway dysfunction, and the many genes or gene products that regulate these processes. Addressing these issues will be an important step forward towards a better understanding of asthma pathogenesis and more effective treatments.",
