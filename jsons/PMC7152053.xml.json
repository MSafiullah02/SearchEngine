This may reflect the popularity of frozen poultry in Australia. Some authorities no longer report the finding of the classical strains of enteropathogenic E. coli, for example this was not done in the Bangladeshi report. Others have not studied enterotoxigenic E. coli. Thus a total comprehensive survey comparing the aetiology in developing and developed communities is lacking. The high prevalence of bacterial pathogens in the Indonesian study related to the remarkably high level of isolation of enteropathogenic E. coli. In any event the high percentage of bacterial isolation in the Indonesian series is related to the prevalence of malnutrition and poor hygiene in the community. This is well illustrated by the observations of Gracey (1973) in young malnourished aboriginals with acute diarrhoea in Australia, where there is a similar prevalence of malnutrition and poor hygiene. He found that from a group of 251 such patients, 47 excreted a serotype of enteropathogenic E. coli, 17 a species of salmonella and 25 a shigella. A similar high isolation rate of bacterial pathogens in another developing community was reported by Maiya et al. (1976), who found recognized bacterial pathogens in the stools of 66% of a group of children under 2 years of age with acute gastroenteritis in Southern India, observed overa 12-month period.",

Feldman, Bhat and Kamath (1970) in South India have shown a dissociation between the pattern of clinical illness and the pattern of isolation of bacterial pathogens in an impressive epidemiological survey of pre-school Indian children. However, such isolation does provide good presumptive evidence of a cause and effect relationship at the time of an outbreak of infective diarrhoea when other children are found to excrete the same pathogen, but care has to be taken when interpreting the significance of the results of stool culture taken from an individual child with acute diarrhoea and vomiting.",

Animal studies have greatly helped our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved. Formal et al. (1976) have shown that in both salmonellosis and shigellosis bacterial invasion of the colonic mucosa does occur. This is associated with acute inflammatory reaction and mucosal damage and, in turn, there is abnormal colonic salt and water transport. In the animals studied they have also found that the jejunum is in a net secretory state despite the absence of bacterial invasion or morphological abnormalities in the jejunum. In these circumstances the diarrhoea produced by invasive organisms results from the inability of the colon to reabsorb the increased volume of fluid entering the colon from the small intestine.",

The ability of bacteria to adhere to the intestinal mucosa is an essential prerequisite for colonization of the small intestine and for pathogenicity. McNeish et al. in 1975 showed for the first time the relevance of bacterial adhesion to human disease. They showed that diarrhoeagenic E. coli could adhere to human foetal intestine whereas non-entero-pathogenic strains of E. coli did not. Species specificity was shown inasmuch that E. coli which adhered to human small intestine did not adhere to brush border preparations from the small intestine of guinea-pigs, rabbits, calves and pigs. The fact that adhesion of enteropathogenic E. coli was mediated by a 60-megadalton plasmid was later established (Williams et al., 1978). A plasmid is an extra-chromosomal genetic element. Knutton et al. (1984) have developed a practical in vitro assay for adhesion. Adhesion is clearly an important early event for colonization by bacteria of the intestine.",

In other infants, the onset of the illness was sudden and its course so fulminant that, even though they were brought quickly to hospital, they were moribund on admission. In only 11 of 77 deaths was it clear that progressive deterioration over a period of days had occurred at home.

Protection is diminished when the infant is being weaned onto solid food or cows' milk, i.e. when the baby is not exclusively breast fed. The risk is obviously far greater when these weaning foods are heavily bacterially contaminated. The problem posed by this in the developing world has been highlighted by Rowland, Barnell and Whitehead (1978) who have pointed out that traditional weaning foods used for young infants in West Africa can be hazardous bacteriologically. Thus providing a breast-fed infant with such supplements under the prevailing conditions in the developing world may be dangerous. Indeed, because of such weaning practices with bacteriologically contaminated food, infantile infective diarrhoea can continue to be very common in a community, despite breast feeding. Commercial baby milks and feeding bottles in such an environment can also carry similar risks. In such traditional societies, however, infants remain relatively free from gastrointestinal disorders so long as they are exclusively breast fed.",

Thus, gastroenteritis continues to be a problem of enormous importance in developing communities; for example, Papua New Guinea, where gastroenteritis was the commonest cause of hospital admission in children aged 1\u20134 years in 1967 (Biddulph and Pangkatana, 1971). Its prevalence is a major factor in the genesis of protein-calorie malnutrition in such communities. In South Africa, Hansen (1968) has observed in a careful 1-year follow-up of 80 admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis in Capetown, that 12 subsequently developed kwashiorkor, 37 had loss of weight and failed to improve during the year of observation, and a total of 62 children had recurrent diarrhoea of varying severity. Walker (1971) has estimated that 20% of Australian aboriginal children in the northern part of the Northern Territory are admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis before their second birthday. Thus there is a close interaction between malnutrition, gastroenteritis and chronic diarrhoea in developing communities, and gastroenteritis continues to be a very important health hazard among children from such communities.",

In fact, following publication of the Department of Health and Social Security's Report Present-day Practice in Infant Feeding in 1974, and revised subsequently, which described the hazards of high solute milks, there has been a remarkable fall in the prevalence of hypernatraemic dehydration. This change relates to the replacement of high-solute milks by low-solute milks for most infants under 6 months in Britain. The only way an infant can have high solute milk today is if he is given undiluted cows' milk. Manuel and Walker-Smith (1980) observed a fall in the number of children admitted with hypernatraemic dehydration to the gastroenteritis unit at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and this trend has since accelerated. This change is illustrated in Table 6.9\n. It is noteworthy that there were deaths in the early years but none since 1977. Indeed the disappearance of hypernatraemic dehydration as a cause of death has been reported in Sheffield, from December 1976 (Sunderland and Emery, 1979) and in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, from 1977 (Arneil and Chin, 1979). The relative importance of warnings concerning the overconcentration of feeds and the switch from high-solute to low-solute milks leading to this change is emphasized differently by the two groups. Whichever factor is more important it is clear that reduction in the solute load fed to infants in Britain has dramatically reduced the incidence of hypernatraemic dehydration and has been a major factor in further lowering infant mortality from gastroenteritis (Davies et al., 1977).",

The volume of the extracellular fluid tends to be maintained to a greater degree in hypertonic dehydration when compared with isotonic dehydration and so signs of circulatory collapse appear later. Their appearance is ominous because of the degree of water deficit by then apparent. In addition, the usual skin criteria for diagnosing dehydration are not accurate, the skin having a characteristic doughy consistency. The fontanelle is typically not sunken, and in many cases may even bulge. This type of dehydration tends to occur more often in obese infants, being related to previous high solute intake. There is a risk in such infants that the signs of dehydration may be underestimated because of their obesity. The state of consciousness is usually depressed, and some infants with a severe degree of hypernatraemic dehydration may have convulsions, which may be related to brain shrinkage, a drop in CSF pressure causing haemorrhage in the central nervous system. Cerebral thromboses may also sometimes occur.",

Kingston (1973) found that more than 80% of infants in Liberia with gastroenteritis had hypotonic dehydration. He has emphasized the importance of recognition of hypokalaemia in these circumstances and its appropriate treatment. Kingston believes that continued intake of small amounts of breast milk at frequent intervals while diarrhoea continues is an important factor in the infants he described, as the sodium and potassium contents of breast milk are so low (Table 6.11\n). He considers that a different pattern of water and electrolyte disturbance is seen when gastroenteritis occurs in breast-fed infants, as distinct from formula fed children.

This has the advantages of compactness and convenience over an already made up solution but as seen in Figure. 6.13 it does carry the occasional risk of being made up inaccurately and so producing a dangerously high osmolality. Therefore a study was made of a ready-to-use glucose electrolyte solution (Dextrolyte, Cow & Gate) in the outpatient management of infants with acute gastroenteritis (Trounce et al., 1985). This showed this solution was readily accepted by parents and children. Twenty-two samples of the mixture as actually given to the baby were brought for analysis. The osmolality ranged from 291 to 308 mosm l\u22121 with a mean of 298 mosm l\u22121. Thus in no case was there a dangerously high level. A disadvantage of ready to feed solutions is the risk of bacterial contamination once the bottle is opened. At present such solutions are presented in 100 ml bottles and parents are advised to discard the unused portion. If such solutions are refrigerated even when the bottle is opened and used again the risk of bacterial contamination is minimal (Santosham et al., 1982). These workers showed that if the solution is stored at 4\u00b0C after the introduction of 1000 colonies of E. coli it will remain sterile 24 hours later, whereas if it is stored at room temperature the E. coli will, not surprisingly, grow freely.",

The speed of this process of regrading will depend upon the individual infant's circumstances; in particular, the severity of his vomiting and diarrhoea during the acute episode and the persistence or otherwise of such symptoms. Regrading is usually done in quarter-strength increments, i.e. starting with quarter-strength dilution of the milk feeding with the glucose electrolyte mixture moving up to full strength in quarters (Table 6.16\n) at intervals of 24 hours. This is a slow regrade. When the increments occur at 6 or 12 hours this is known as a fast regrade. The rationale for this conventional approach is based upon the following points:\u2022The perceived need to provide a short period of relative bowel rest by giving dilute feed of increasing strength following the acute onset at a time when the small intestinal mucosa is known to be damaged (at least in the case of viral diarrhoea, see\npage 223) and is then recovering.\u2022To prevent a significant return of symptoms, i.e. relapse, by rapidly returning to a lactose containing feed which might result in osmotic diarrhoea in view of the state of temporary lactase deficiency related to the small intestinal mucosal damage present at this time or due to malabsorption of some other nutrient by the damaged mucosa.\u2022\nTo prevent food (i.e. cows' milk) sensitization by reducing antigen load at a time when the small intestinal mucosa is abnormal and there is evidence of increased antigen uptake (Gruskay and Cooke, 1955) and increased permeability to sugar (Ford et al., 1985). Both factors predispose to increased antigen entry to the mucosa and so to sensitization.\n",

This risk of relapse was confined to children under the age of 9 months. Thus it was considered that in children older than 9 months gradual reintroduction of milk was not necessary. However, for those aged under 9 months there was a significantly greater risk of relapse due mainly to temporary lactose intolerance associated with rotavirus infection.

There are now seven serotype antigens recognized. Before rotaviruses could be cultured these were thought to relate directly to antibody serotypes in the patient's serum but this is not so. All this progress has been related to neutralization assays and cell culture facility. This is very time consuming. The use of monoclonal antibodies would be much simpler. Shaw et al.

(1984) described three categories of stool rotavirus excretors. First, there were those who had rotavirus gastroenteritis; second, those with asymptomatic infection, i.e. rotavirus with serological response and no symptoms; third, rotavirus carriers. Burke, Gracey and Masters reported (1985) in response to Champsaur et al. (1984) that 121 (10.5%) of 1156 children with diarrhoea and 51 (8.6%) of 593 children without diarrhoea excreted rotavirus! These observations suggest rotavirus has variable pathogenicity. A comprehensive cohort study has been reported from rural Costa Rica (Simhon and Mata, 1985) who found a low pathogenicity for rotavirus. This was strikingly different from their earlier studies in Santa Maria Caque in Guatemala where there was a high pathogenicity (Mata et al., 1983). However, the overall incidence of diarrhoea was much less in Costa Rica. They believe that the more heavily contaminated environment and the presumably larger infectious dose the children receive in Guatemala, may be the critical factors in explaining this difference.",

As long ago as 1929, Zahorsky described winter vomiting disease and, in 1973, two winter epidemics of non-bacterial gastroenteritis were described in north-west London (Sinha and Tyrell, 1973). A study of monthly admissions to a gastroenteritis unit in Sydney from 1961 to 1972 showed the sudden appearance of a winter peak in hospital admissions in 1964, which persisted in subsequent years (see\nFigure. 6.12). An association between this winter peak and rotavirus in the stools was reported from Melbourne (Davidson et al., 1975b), Toronto (Hamilton et al., 1976), Washington (Kapikian et al., 1976), Birmingham (Flewett et al., 1973) and London (Figure. 6.7), i.e. in cold and temperate climates. The peak prevalence may approach 80% among infants and young children during the winter months in North America (Kapikian et al., 1976; Hamilton et al., 1976). In some reports, the virus is not found at all during the summer months but in others it falls to a 20% level or thereabouts.",

At 40 hours they found decreased sodium and water flux, decreased mucosal activities of disaccharidases and sodium, potassium-ATPase, but normal adenyl cyclase activity. Unlike enterotoxigenic diarrhoeas such a cholera, under these experimental conditions, sodium flux failed to respond to glucose. Ferguson and Snodgrass (1978) have gone on to study infection of 1-day-old germ-free lambs with rotavirus. They found a state of accelerated epithelial cell turnover with functionally immature enterocytes clothing the villi.

It does, in fact, seem clear that rotavirus can be a cause of gastroenteritis in the neonate, as suggested by Bishop et al. (1976). Quite severe symptoms have been observed in premature babies in some special care baby units (Bryden et al., 1982). The role of rotavirus antibodies in protecting the infants against rotavirus infection is uncertain. A clue to why some with stool rotavirus do not get clinical disease is provided by Murphy et al., who found that children who had in their stools viruses coated with an \u2018antibody-like\u2019 material did not get diarrhoea. It is known from the work of Matthews et al. (1976) that breast milk and cows' milk contain non-antibody virus inhibitor and this may play a role too. So neonates appear to be relatively immune to serious rotavirus infection. Rotavirus has now been described to occur endemically among neonates in hospital nurseries in a number of countries as well as England and Australia, namely the United States and Sweden (Grillner et al., 1985). In these studies rotavirus infection occurred throughout the year without any obvious seasonal variation. Another feature is the difficulty in eradicating the virus from nurseries. This may relate to the role of the staff.",

This is a relatively simple technique provided an electron microscope is available. Second is the technique of counterimmunoelectrophoresis. This is a technique to detect viral antigen in the stool (Spence, Farrel and Bourchard, 1975; Middleton, Petric and Hewitt, 1976). It appears to be about as sensitive as the electron microscope technique. Third is serum serology using a complement fixation technique. This was developed by Kapikian, Cline and Mebus (1975). With rotavirus stool antigen, these workers showed a rise in serum antibody titre with a complement fixation test using acute and convalescent sera. A related antigen, Nebraska calf rotavirus, is more readily available. Fourth is an indirect immunofluorescent antibody technique (Davidson et al., 1975b). This is a difficult technique but one that seems to be slightly more sensitive than the complement fixation test. Fifth is the ELISA technique.",

In a prospective study of sugar intolerance at Queen Elizabeth Hospital of 200 children with acute gastroenteritis (Trounce and Walker-Smith, 1985) 45 children had rotavirus gastroenteritis. 15 (45%) developed sugar intolerance, 9 (20%) were monosaccharide intolerant and 6 (15%) were disaccharide intolerant. In this relatively small study there was only a statistical association between rotavirus infection and sugar intolerance. This was not found with any other virus or bacterial pathogen although the numbers were small. The glucose electrolyte solution used at the time of the study was much higher than that presently used so its importance may have been higher at that time than today. An association between sugar malabsorption and rotavirus would in fact be expected in view of the damage to microvilli in infected enterocytes (Bishop et al., 1973). In addition, it would appear theoretically possible that severe and extensive infection could temporarily damage a high proportion of lactase activity of the enterocytes and, perhaps, also cause a transient surface block to sugar absorption by temporarily damaging the brush border membrane which would cause a block in absorption to all sugars, as proposed by Walker-Smith, Kamath and Stobo (1972). The clinical severity would depend on the number of enterocytes damaged. Finally, Holmes et al. (1976) have suggested that lactase is the receptor and uncoating enzyme for rotavirus. This would mean that infants with their high lactase levels may be more vulnerable, helping to explain the age of most affected individuals.",

Antibody levels tend to rise with age, reaching adult levels at two years (Kapikian et al., 1976). Children with pre-existing antibody have become infected, however. Infection with one subgroup may not protect against another. Infants aged 6-24 months appear more susceptible to infection regardless of the presence of antibody in their sera. Lower prevalence rates of rotavirus infection under 6 months may be attributable to immunity acquired from the mother.

In this skewed distribution the median age was 9 months and the mean 21.7 months; 66% of the patients were less than 12 months of age and 10% less than or equal to 3 months of age. The occurrence of enteric fever was unrelated to age, although numbers are small (Figure. 6.24\n). Asian children were over-represented in these children with salmonella infections. All enteric fevers occurred in children of Asian immigrants. Paratyphoid fever was acquired in Pakistan by one child, and in India by the other. Typhoid fever occurred in two children who had not left the country but had contacts who had recently acquired typhoid in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Two children acquired non-typhoid salmonella infections during visits to their countries of origin, Italy and Mauritius.",

In that year, Bray at the Hillingdon Hospital in London published observations he had made concerning the isolation of enteropathogenic strains of E. coli from infants with summer diarrhoea. It has subsequently been widely confirmed that certain strains of E. coli are enteropathogenic. The criteria for accepting such enteropathogenicity usually includes the consistent isolation of a particular strain in an epidemic as the predominant coliform in the stools of affected infants and its relative rarity in the general community. The antigenic structure of each strain is recorded and reference criteria are developed for future recognition.",

Enterotoxigenic E. coli have been shown to produce two types of toxin. First, there is the heat-labile (LT) enterotoxin that is antigenically and functionally similar to cholera toxin. It stimulates adenyl cyclase, as does cholera enterotoxin, and also produces an excess loss of water into the intestinal lumen, i.e. a secretory state. The second toxin is the non-antigenic heat-stable (ST) toxin whose mode of action is via stimulation of another intracellular mediator (cyclic GMP) (Field, 1978). Our understanding of these mechanisms of enteropathogenicity have been considerably expanded by animal work, notably that of Williams Smith (1976). It has now been shown from such studies that the ability of E. coli to colonize the gut, adhere to mucosal surface, and to produce enterotoxin can be transmitted from one organism to another by transmissible plasmids. These are extra-chromosomal genetic elements. Thus plasmids could transfer the potential to produce one of these capacities, e.g. enterotoxin production, to organisms not ordinarily regarded as pathogens. At present, enterotoxin can be demonstrated only by its effect on animal models or on cultured cells. The development of a simple laboratory procedure that would allow rapid recognition of such an enterotoxin would be a great advantage and might demonstrate the Enteropathogenicity of hitherto unsuspected organisms.",

Although enterotoxin producing strains of E. coli that cause a severe disease with profound fluid loss, sometimes referred to as cholera infantum, may occur such disease is far more common in the developing world than in developed communities. The best evidence that these mechanisms of toxin production and invasion are causes of human disease comes from studies of E. coli strains that cause traveller's diarrhoea in adults. In fact, most studies of classical enteropathogenic E. coli serotypes have failed to show that those strains, associated with sporadic or epidemic cases of infantile diarrhoea, possess either invasive or toxin-producing properties. Levine et al. (1978) have shown that three enteropathogenic strains (0127, 0128, 0142) given to adult volunteers all cause diarrhoea, but despite this there is no evidence of toxin production or invasiveness of these strains in extensive laboratory studies.

This is more common in children less than 5 years of age and is usually caused by Y. enterocolitica. Fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and less commonly vomiting last from 1 to 3 weeks. The stools may contain leucocytes and sometimes blood and mucus. Chronic diarrhoea occasionally simulates chronic inflammatory bowel disease (see\nChapter. 9). In children over 5 years old abdominal pain is a common complaint and often mimics acute appendicitis. Fever and leucocytosis are common while diarrhoea may or may not be present. Terminal ileitis, commoner with Y. enterocolitica, and mesenteric adenitis, commoner with Y. pseudotuberculosis, are found at laparotomy. Those who escape surgery frequently develop a right iliac fossa mass which usually subsides with adequate treatment. Pharyngitis may accompany the gastrointestinal presentation. Serious disease, especially septicaemia, is uncommon in healthy children and is usually associated with immuno-compromised hosts, cirrhosis, diabetes and haematological disease. Thalassaemics are particularly susceptible as they are iron overloaded, and being treated with desferrioxamine therapy, factors which favour yersinia. In common with other living organisms, nearly all bacteria require iron for growth and usually acquire it by producing sideophores which are low molecular weight compounds with a high affinity for ferric iron (Neilands 1981). In mammals, the bacteria must compete for available iron with lactoferrin or transferrin. The bound iron is then internalized by specific membrane receptors allowing the bacteria to multiply in tissues (Finkelstein, Sciortina and Mcintosh, 1983).",

It is likely that yersinia has receptors for desferrioxamine and can utilize the bound iron directly, thus increasing its virulence. In mice with yersinia infections, prior administration of desferrioxamine reduced the median lethal dose 100 000 fold compared with mice pre-treated with iron dextran (Robins-Browne et al., 1985). In addition, continued administration of desferrioxamine led to yersinia septicaemia in adults with iron-overload and in normal children with iron poisoning (Melby et al., 1982).",

The children had an acute diarrhoeal illness of short duration, sometimes with blood in the stools. Aeromonas spp. were isolated from 4.1% of children who had stools examined during the study period. Their age ranged from 2 months to 7.5 years, 33 children had Aeromonas spp. identified, 16 had enterotoxin producing Aeromonas hydrophilia, nine enterotoxin producing Aeromonas sobria and eight non-entero-toxin producing Aeromonas caviae. Gracey et al. (1982) suggest that non-entero-toxin producing organisms are not a significant cause of gastroenteritis. Six children had associated pathogens, bacteria or viruses. Five patients had recently returned from abroad, chiefly from developing countries. The clinical associations of the 25 children who had no other pathogen is shown in Table 6.22\n. Four children had bloody diarrhoea. Only six patients were admitted to hospital. Thus aeromonas infection is rarely associated with serious sequelae, other than in the immunosuppressed patient. There are reports, however, of clinical features similar to ulcerative colitis (Gracey et al., 1982).",

It may be confused with coeliac disease when the child's diet includes gluten. Indeed, the differential diagnosis of any child under 2 years with chronic diarrhoea and failure to thrive is an important problem. In these circumstances the following diagnoses need to be considered, namely post-enteritis syndrome, coeliac disease, cystic fibrosis, giardiasis and cows' milk sensitive enteropathy as well as an anatomical abnormality of the small intestine. Chronic diarrhoea without failure to thrive following acute gastroenteritis needs to be distinguished from toddler's diarrhoea in which there is chronic diarrhoea but no failure to thrive (see\nChapter. 12). Sometimes follow-up is the only way to establish the diagnosis definitely. Small intestinal biopsy has a key role in diagnosis. When symptoms have been present for 3 weeks or more after gastroenteritis, and there is doubt about the diagnosis, a small intestinal biopsy should be considered. This will demonstrate whether there is any structural abnormality of the small intestinal mucosa that may account for the child's continuing symptoms (Figure. 6.26\n).

The largest group was under the age of 3 months at the time of the acute attack. In this youngest age group there was a clear male predominance. Analysis of more recent experience between 4th October 1976 and 20th January 1978 (Manuel, 1978) has shown a comparable prevalence of delayed recovery in the age group under 6 months, namely 30% compared with 27% in 1973. There has, however, been a reduction in the total number of children admitted under 6 months, and a reduction particularly in those admitted under 3 months of age. The reason for this welcome change parallels the increase in breast feeding in the community and also the change in artificial feeding from high solute milks to low solute milks (see\npage 22) between 1973 and 1977 (Table 6.23). Nevertheless, delayed recovery is more likely to occur in infants who develop gastroenteritis under 6 months, and it is also more likely to be a more serious problem within that age range.",

This argument is supported by the further fall in frequency of lactose intolerance as a complication of acute gastroenteritis at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for children. In the most recent survey (Armistead et al., 1987) of patients seen in 1986, there was no case of clinical sugar intolerance (although the glucose concentration of the GEM was significantly lower). Admittedly, these were all mild cases of gastroenteritis. This was also found in a Finnish report of the same year (Isolauri et al., 1986). Likewise the observation from North America (Groothuis et al., 1986) that replacement of lactose with either sucrose or glucose polymer in a soy-based formula offered no advantage is consistent with this view of the diminishing importance of lactose intolerance in mild gastroenteritis in Western societies (Lancet, 1987). This is probably due to the decline in cows' milk sensitive enteropathy as an important complication of gastroenteritis due to the decreased sensitizing capacities of modern adapted milk feedings.",

Haidas et al. in a pilot study found that IgA numbers in the small intestinal mucosa were reduced in children diagnosed as milk-elimination responsive enteropathy, largely post-enteritis using a horseradish peroxidase method. Surprisingly, using an immunofluorescent technique Kilby et al. (1976) found IgA cell numbers to be increased. Kilby's children were more heterogeneous but it is not easy to resolve this difference. Nevertheless the possibility that there is a temporary IgA deficiency as suggested by Soothill (1976) still remains. A temporary opsonization defect has also been described. In addition immaturity of suppressor T-cell function has been suggested. The relative importance of all these immunodeficiency states must still be regarded as uncertain. Another partial explanation may relate to the immaturity of the small intestinal mucosa. The thinness of the mucosa in infants with cows' milk sensitive enteropathy as described by Maluenda et al. (1984) is in accord with this as well as the apparent limited ability of the crypt cells to respond to enterocyte loss. This immaturity may be important too in the ability of food antigens to adhere more readily to the microvillous membrane in immature animals. It is certainly true that post-enteritis food-sensitive enteropathy occurs particularly in young infants and is confined to infants less than 2 years of age.",

Thus there is morphological evidence that antigen entry can occur but what is critical is whether such entry is associated with sensitization. A key factor here may be the antigenicity or allergenicity of the food usually cows' milk fed at the time of acute gastroenteritis. There are both animal and clinical observations to suggest that allergenicity is of critical importance. Figure. 5.3 illustrates an hypothesis linking these factors.

Avigad et al. (1978) have investigated the flora of the small intestine in children with the post-enteritis syndrome. They cultured duodenal juice and the homogenized duodenal mucosa from children with the post-enteritis syndrome, children with other causes of chronic diarrhoea, and a control group of children without diarrhoea. They found no significant difference in bacterial flora as measured by total bacterial flora within these three groups. The role of bacterial colonization of the small intestine and enteric disease was discussed briefly in Chapter. 1. Its role in this syndrome is not yet clear but Avigad et al. (1978) using an immunofluorescent technique were able to demonstrate mucosal antibodies against the bacteria grown from the luminal fluid or mucosa of the same children from children with the post-enteritis syndrome, and other causes of chronic diarrhoea. The finding of such antibodies was unrelated to the presence or absence of an enteropathy. Mucosal antibody to these non-pathogenic bacteria, obtained from the duodenal juice or homogenate culture, was present in 8 of 9 children with the post-enteritis syndrome regardless of whether an enteropathy was present. Antibody was also found in three children with other causes of chronic diarrhoea, but antibody was not present in the control group who did not have diarrhoea at the time of biopsy, except in one child who had previously had an enteropathy, and possibly one doubtful case who also had a previous enteropathy. The role of such small intestinal mucosal antibodies against non-pathogenic organisms cultured from the small intestine of these children is not clear in relation to the pathogenesis of chronic diarrhoea in children, but clearly warrants further study.",

Normally, no bacteria adhere to the surface of such follicles but as Figure. 6.29 shows there can be adhesion of rod-like bacteria to the surface, whereas bacteria were not adhering to the rest of the biopsy. This was a specimen taken from a child with post-enteritis syndrome shown to be producing antibody to rod-like bacteria. This preferential adhesion of bacteria to the surface of the lymphoid follicular region is interesting because there is now good evidence that antigen entry occurs through the epithelium overlying lymphoid follicles, and that immunoblast cells are primed at these sites prior to migration to the lamina propria of the gut mucosa where they secrete immunoglobulin (see\nChapter. 1). Thus adherence of bacteria to the overlying epithelium of the lymph follicle may be related to antibody production and may have significance in the pathogenesis of this child's continuing diarrhoea.",
