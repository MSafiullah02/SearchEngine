To perform a more in-depth analysis, we collected additional information for all individuals with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections during February 2015. This included all cases meeting the case definition as described above, as well as those identified as having a laboratory-confirmed case but no recognized symptoms; individuals not meeting the case definition [21] were typically identified through contact tracing. We reviewed available MoH case investigation records and data reported through the MoH Health Electronic Surveillance Network. We collected demographic information, medical history, outcome information, and treatment location. We assessed the likelihood of acquisition from another person (secondary acquisition) by determining whether a patient (1) was a healthcare professional (HCP), (2) had been admitted to a healthcare facility 2\u201314 days before illness onset, (3) had visited any healthcare facility in the 14 days before illness onset, or (4) had direct contact with either another documented case of MERS-CoV infection or with someone with an acute respiratory illness of unknown cause in the 14 days prior to illness. When it was not possible to determine the criteria described above by using available information, we conducted telephone interviews (in Arabic) to collect additional exposure information. Proxies (a close friend or immediate family member who was familiar with the patient's activities during this period) were interviewed if the case was deceased, still hospitalized, or too ill to participate. Among cases without any of the aforementioned risk factors for secondary acquisition (hereafter referred to as sporadic cases), we asked during telephone interviews about the history of exposure to camels [9]. Interviewees were prompted to describe examples of camel exposures, including direct contact or visiting a live market, slaughterhouse, or race where camels were present. We also assessed travel history.",

The multiple sequence alignment was then imported into the RDP software for detection of recombination. The software uses several algorithms, including GENECONV, BootScan, MaxChi, Chimaera, SiScan, and 3Seq, to detect putative recombination events. The potential minor and major parental sequences and the beginning and end breakpoints of the potential recombinant sequences were also defined by RDP4 software. Putative recombinant events were considered significant when a P value of \u2264 .05 was observed for the same event, using \u22654 algorithms.",

Phylogenetic analysis of the 99 spike sequences with 251 previously published sequences (Figure 1) revealed a novel subclade (henceforth referred to as NRC-2015) within clade B [18]; this subclade contained most (72 of 99 [72.7%]) of the 2015 sequences and included sequences recently reported from travel-associated MERS cases in the Republic of Korea (accession number KT029139), China (KT006149), and Thailand (KT225476). The neighbor joining tree bootstrap value supporting NRC-2015 was low (<70%), which may reflect the recombinant character of the clade sequences (see below) or the lower number of informative sites in the spike gene. However, similar tree topologies reproducing NRC-2015 were obtained with the spike gene sequences by both maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses, supporting this finding (data not shown).

Our investigation demonstrates the emergence, persistent circulation, and eventual predominance of a recently identified recombinant MERS-CoV clade in humans that includes viruses detected in the Republic of Korea [31, 32], Thailand (accession number KT225476), and China in 2015 [31, 33]. Previous documentation of the duration of circulation in humans of 4 different MERS-CoV clades in Saudi Arabia during 2012\u20132013 noted an average detection time of 98 days [19]. In contrast, we demonstrate that NRC-2015 has persisted longer than most previously documented clades. NRC-2015 was found to eventually predominate over the 6-month study period and attain a wide geographic distribution in a comparatively short period. While this apparent emergence and clade displacement is suggestive of greater epidemiologic fitness [34], we observed no clinical differences between NRC-2015 and other clades; the implications for virus replication and transmission need further study. During preparation of this manuscript, sequences obtained from camels in Oman in May 2015 [35] and Saudi Arabia during July 2014\u2013April 2015 [36] were reported that showed similar recombination features and phylogenetic association with NRC-2015. In camels, NRC-2015 (referred to as lineage 5 [36]) was first detected in July 2014 and became predominant in Saudi Arabia during a period that overlaps with our study, corroborating our findings of an increased prevalence in humans relative to other clades.",

Genome analysis of human MERS-CoV strains from Saudi Arabia in 2015 and the recent outbreak in South Korea/China [31\u201333] and camels as noted above [35, 36] revealed a probable signature recombination event between 2 different parental clade B viruses involving a region of the ORF1ab and spike genes. We confirmed this finding and documented an increasing prevalence of this virus in humans among samples collected since January 2015 from geographically distant communities in Saudi Arabia. Similar to recent reports [33], we estimate that this recombinant virus emerged sometime in mid-to-late 2014. Based on recently available sequence data from camels in Saudi Arabia, NRC-2015 (lineage 5) was predicted to have diverged between December 2013 and June 2014 [36].",

First, specimens were not available for all cases during the study period, meaning that many viruses remained untyped; however, we observed no demographic differences between cases who had specimens sequenced and those who did not. Second, since its emergence in 2012, surveillance and sequencing of MERS-CoV strains has been incomplete; variations in sequence availability and documentation might have influenced the extent of persistence and geographic spread that we have determined for past circulating virus strains. Case definitions, testing practices, and testing locations have also changed during this period. Third, although we were able to obtain full genome sequences from 12 NRC-2015 samples, all of which possessed the expected recombinant signal, our sequencing was mostly limited to the spike gene alone, which poses the risk of misclassifying recombinant viruses as belonging to NRC-2015. This is illustrated in the recent study by Sabir et al [36], which reported multiple novel recombinant viruses in camels, including recombinants between NRC-2015 (lineage 5) and other virus clades. Fourth, because of the high morbidity and mortality of MERS-CoV infection, interviews with cases were not always possible, necessitating the use of proxies. It is possible that, combined with issues of recall, the quality of the information collected varied. Of particular consideration, 11 of 13 sporadic cases were classified on the basis of interviews with proxies, and pre-illness exposures might not have been accurately recognized and reported. Fifth, some camel exposures may have gone unrecognized because of disincentives for reporting camel exposures, given their cultural and economic significance in Saudi Arabia. Sixth, given the existing evidence of association between MERS-CoV illness and pre-illness healthcare exposure or exposure to sick individuals [10, 11, 13], our risk classification was hierarchical; that is, reported exposure to a setting where secondary acquisition was likely took precedence over reported exposure to camels. As such, we did not assess camel exposures in individuals with recognized risks for secondary acquisition.",

Recent phylogeny of MERS-CoV sequences from camels in Saudi Arabia indicated that the novel recombinant subclade (referred to as NRC-2015 in our manuscript) was also predominant in camels during a period overlapping with our study [36]. As such, our detection of closely related viruses in humans might in part reflect multiple introductions from camels with similar strains. Virus introductions from other currently unidentified sources might also be factor. Virus transmission dynamics within and between human and nonhuman sources of MERS-CoV will likely influence transmission routes in ways not yet fully understood.",
