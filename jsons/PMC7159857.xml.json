The number of infected patients in Lombardia make up a substantial proportion of the 101 739 total SARS-CoV-2 infections in Italy (according to available data on March 31, 2020). The Italian patients with cystic fibrosis were resident in endemic areas and acquired the infection from family members. These observations, as well as data from other European countries (five patients with cystic fibrosis in France have been reported to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, seven in the UK, five in Germany and three [one transplanted] in Spain) suggest few patients with cystic fibrosis, mainly adults, are becoming infected with SARS-CoV-19, without apparent effect on cystic fibrosis disease severity. From these data, it is not possible to identify factors that might be protective, for example use of long-term antibiotic therapy such as azithromycin.",

Recommendations for preventive measures that were already established in this population, such as using face masks and practising adequate hand hygiene, were reinforced. The cystic fibrosis team in Milan cancelled routine clinic appointments to prevent unnecessary hospital visits and viral spread. Procedures such as respiratory function testing and bronchoscopy were put on hold. Phone calls and email contacts were used to monitor the clinical condition of patients and to provide psychological support immediately after the lockdown.",
