Adaptation efforts will be important to reduce the impact of these risks. Public health systems are in place in Canada to control many disease risks but there are still knowledge gaps on, and modifications needed to, existing approaches to protecting the population from endemic diseases and new or emerging pathogens. This chapter addresses five key questions on whether public health is on track to helping communities adapt to changing risks. The questions address adaptation to disease risk of climate change by exploring the following: assessments of disease risks, methods for adaptation, responsibility, resources, and public action and societal will. Overall, with these increasing risks to the health of Canadians, all sectors of society will need to participate in the adaptive response, while federal, provincial, and community public health bodies will need to work together to identify and communicate risk and promote and coordinate adaptation responses.",

Studies in Canada and elsewhere highlight the potential impact of climate change on food-borne, waterborne, and vector-borne diseases, for which environment and climate are important determinants of risk. These determinants vary from increased temperature resulting in increased survival of pathogens through changes in the ecology and geographic range of disease reservoir and vector species. Adaptation to increased risks requires modification of existing approaches to protecting the population from familiar diseases and identification of new or emerging pathogens. Adaptation approaches will likely entail both dedicated interventions such as water treatment and vector control, and changes in human behavior to reduce risk of exposure.",

Studies in Canada have explored relationships between disease or vector occurrence and climate variables through qualitative assessments and simple statistical or mathematical models. These are then applied to climate scenarios to attempt to quantify possible effects of climate change on disease occurrence (Ontario Forest Research 2003; Fleury et al. 2006; Thomas et al. 2006; Ogden et al. 2005 Ogden et al. , 2006 . There is considerable knowledge of drivers of endemic diseases and this knowledge may be sufficient to allow adaptation to changing degrees of risk. The relation between ecosystems, infectious diseases, and global climate change are less intuitive in developed countries where water treatment, vector control, and higher quality housing partly mitigate infectious disease threats (Greer et al. 2008) . However, to be sure, we need further analyses on the complex interactions of climate (and extreme weather events) on microbial or vector replication and survival, the natural environment, and on the human-environmental interaction, which includes human population growth and movement, habitat disruption, and modification.",

However, transmission routes include person to person, water, food, and the environment. Understanding these dynamics is difficult because investigation of the source of individual cases is not routine (Mead et al. 1999 ) and enteric symptoms may relate to non-enteric causes (Powell et al. 2007 ). Systems to ensure food safety, from the farm, through processing, to retail and consumption are established in Canada. Since the Walkerton outbreak, where excess rainfall resulted in contamination of the water supply, there have been advances in water safety regulation and water quality monitoring in Canada (Auld et al. 2004 ).",

Networking amongst public health jurisdictions 4. Effective interventions to prevent disease or reduce incidence Timely detection of disease events implies a surveillance infrastructure capable of identifying both routine and unusual events via regular data analysis. Surveillance programs in Canada are comprehensive for common food-borne and water-borne diseases and some vector-borne zoonoses. They include: direct reporting of laboratory confirmed infections at the local and provincial levels; national, provincial, and territorial reporting of notifiable diseases and selected laboratory identifications of enteric pathogens; as well as provision of laboratory reference services both provincially and nationally. In some cases, nontraditional indicators of health and innovative approaches may be used in disease detection programs. For example, Fig. 11 .1 A flow chart of adaptation activities required to identify and respond to emerging infectious disease threats driven by climate change. Arrows indicate the flow of adaptation activities from initial identification of climate-change-driven disease risks through knowledge acquisition and development of surveillance, forecasting or alert systems and the interventions they trigger to prevent or control disease, as well as collaborations with science research institutions and stakeholders pharmacy data on over-the-counter sales, emergency room visits, and Telehealth calls can provide early warning for local disease events (Edge et al. 2004; Edge et al. 2006) . \"Environmental\" surveillance to detect infection in sentinel animals or vectors and forecasting (Teklehaimanot et al. 2004; Bouden et al. 2008) to detect disease risks before they occur in humans will be crucial to minimizing risks from emerging zoonoses. Canada has relatively comprehensive programs for monitoring trends in food-borne and water-borne diseases and some vector-borne zoonoses. However, as in other developed countries, many diseases are underreported and national statistics represent trends in disease patterns rather than incidence or prevalence of disease (Flint et al. 2005; Majowicz et al. 2005) . While current surveillance approaches in Canada successfully report trends for common diseases, these programs may be less effective for monitoring rarer events, new diseases, and diseases not captured in national statistics. Methods to detect new or unusual diseases should be based on detailed comprehension of pathogen ecology and yield defensible threshold values for risk which trigger interventions. Ideally, feedback in the system will incorporate analysis of surveillance data and comparison with forecasts/projections, and evaluation of the efficacy of interventions. This \"ideal\" system is summarized in Fig. 11 .1. Current initiatives in Canada, such as the C-EnterNet pilot study in Waterloo, Ontario, integrate current information on human enteric disease with levels of pathogen exposure from food, animal, and water sources to detect changes in trends and to contribute to the risk management process (Public Health Agency of Canada 2007).",

The range of diseases that climate change may affect suggests that these issues must be addressed thorough planning of data information systems and by identifying the needs and information required for timely data sharing.

Changes in public health risks resulting from climate change will therefore impact multiple levels in Canada's political infrastructure. However, climate impacts will vary across the country and some effects may be relatively local. For these reasons, the municipality is likely to play a major role in adaptation alongside provincial or territorial and national authorities (Ebi and Semenza 2008) . This implies that local health authorities recognize the issue and make adaptation to changing disease risks a priority. At the provincial and municipal levels, these responsibilities can be addressed by multiple sectors such as agriculture, health, sustainable development, and natural resources. At the national level, the organizations likely to play a major role in adaptation include federal departments and agencies with responsibilities for agriculture and food, environment, and public health. The Canadian response to West Nile virus offers an interesting model in which initial federal government leadership to address the incursion of this new infectious disease in North America has devolved to provincial and municipal decision-making surveillance, and prevention and control activities. This approach permits local needs and concerns to be addressed, including the acceptability of some measures (see Box 11.3).",

A national multi-jurisdictional collaboration was developed to monitor for dead corvids and mosquitoes infected with West Nile virus. The monitoring program itself was managed by a wildlife health NGO, the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre, which in turn coordinated diagnostic and surveillance activities within Canada's veterinary colleges. In the absence of a human vaccine, communications advice on limiting exposure to infected mosquitoes continues to be a major component of the control and prevention activity.

Public health policy and communications that are informed and directed by the best available scientific evidence. 4. Effective communications on climate change-related health issues that are scaled according to the audience, whether health professionals, the public, vulnerable groups, etc., and should provide culturally appropriate, transparent, and balanced information about health risk. The potential for communication approaches to promote changes in behavior at the individual and population levels should not be underestimated (Maibach et al. 2008 ).",

Stern (2007) makes three key points about adaptation that are crucial to understanding an adaptation framework: (1) adaptation is essentially unavoidable, (2) adaptation cannot solve the impacts of climate change but will contribute to limiting those impacts, and (3) the benefits of adaptation will be largely local and can have relatively rapid results.",

            "text": "This chapter has sought to clarify some of the issues posed by the current and future predicted impacts of climate change on infectious disease risks, particularly food-borne, water-borne, and vector-borne agents. Addressing these risks through adaptation approaches is a broad objective of public health which will engage all levels of government, research, industry, and the public in making choices. Government response will inevitably promote a horizontal approach incorporating issues of trade, travel, and animal health in assessing human health and economic risks. Not all choices will be financially costly but may require individual lifestyle changes, such as regular use of insect repellent or education of doctors to include emerging diseases such as Lyme disease in their differential diagnoses. Other strategies would be more expensive with benefits realized over decades, as in the case of safe drinking water infrastructure investment. In the longer term reduced vulnerability to climate change effects, including altered risks to infectious diseases, may have more to do with improved \"social and material conditions of life,\" and leveling of \"inequalities within and between populations\" at risk (McMichael and Kovats 2000) . What is clear is that all sectors of society will be involved in the response and that government has a leadership role in identifying and communicating risk and promoting and coordinating, and sometimes funding, response.",
