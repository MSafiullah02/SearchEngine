This 27-yearold woman at her 30 and 3/7 weeks' gestation was referred to our center with fever, myalgia, and cough. The laboratory investigations showed leukopenia and lymphopenia as well as increased creatinine and CRP levels. The first chest X-ray (faint bilateral patchy opacities) and CT scan (some faint subpleural ground-glass opacities associated with pleural thickening) were not typical for initial COVID-19 pulmonary infection, however, the treatment for COVID-19 was started. Due to respiratory distress, she was intubated and put under mechanical ventilation. After a while, the fetus was born with Apgar score of 0 and did not react to the neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocol. Finally, due to deterioration in the clinical and imaging findings, the patient was expired as a result of multi-organ failure. Following the death, autopsy was performed and the histopathologic evaluations of the lungs showed evidence of viral pneumonia (viral cytopathic effect and a mild increase in alveolar wall thickness) and ARDS (hyaline membrane). Also, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lungs.

According to the phylogenetic studies, the pathogen was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 . Reports have shown different signs among the patients with COVID-19 among which fever and cough were most common [2] . According to the data, several clinical outcomes such as sepsis, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, coagulopathy, acute cardiac injury, and acute kidney injury are significantly (all P-values < 0.0001) higher in non-survivor patients compared to survivors. Thus, these outcomes have been suggested to be monitored more cautiously among the admitted patients [3] .

The patient had no underlying disease and declared no specific issue in her medication and family history (occupation: housekeeper). She noted no contact with anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 as well as no recent travel history (inside or outside of Iran) in the past two weeks. All the previous pregnancy scheduled screening tests had been performed to the date and all were normal. As mentioned in the maternity hospital summery sheet, early examinations showed respiratory rate (RR) = 34/min, heart rate (HR) = 110/min, body temperature (BT) = 39\u00b0C, blood pressure (BP) = 100/60 mmHg, O 2 saturation = 93%, and fetal heart rate (FHR) = 170/min. Also, it was noted on the summery sheet that patient had received oseltamivir, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone for less than 24 h. Also, results of vaginal examination and fern test stated to be normal by the maternity hospital. Due to tachypnea, she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and some laboratory tests were requested (Table 1) . Also, a chest X-ray ( Fig. 1-A) was performed that showed faint bilateral patchy opacities. Considering the CXR findings, azithromycin, oseltamivir, and ceftazidime were started for the patient. Also, based on the CXR findings and after confirming with her gynecologist, a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed (using abdominal shield) which revealed faint subpleural ground-glass opacities as well as pleural thickening ( Fig. 1-C) . According to the published data to that date, the mentioned findings were not completely in concordance with COIVD-19 [3, [7] [8] [9] . However, due to the abnormal imaging findings, the patient was transferred to our center. At the first moment of arrival, she seemed ill and toxic and her examinations showed RR = 37/min, HR = 130/min, the BT = 39.5\u00b0C, BP = 135/85 mmHg, and O 2 saturation = 92% (pulse oximetry). She was immediately transferred to the ICU and a full laboratory test was requested (Table 1 ) which most importantly showed leukopenia and thrombocytopenia accompanied with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Soon after, the fever increased up to 40\u00b0C and RR to 55/min accompanied by suprasternal and intercostal retraction. Immediate blood tests showed metabolic alkalosis while the patient was under non-invasive ventilation. Finally, she was intubated and put under mechanical ventilation (Mode: SIMV(VC)+PSV, FiO 2 : 100%, rate 18/min, VT: 350 ml, and O 2 saturation 85%). Following another portable CXR, infectious service consult, and suspicion of COVID-19, oseltamivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, hydroxychloroquine, meropenem, and vancomycin were started (azithromycin and ceftazidime were discontinued in our center). The bedside trans-thoracic echocardiography was ordered which results showed severe right ventricle and atrium enlargement, severe right side systolic dysfunction, and tricuspid valve regurgitation (systolic pulmonary artery pressure = 70 mmHg), with an ejection fraction (EF) ratio of 50% (other issues were not notable). Also, an hour after intubation, BP was decreased to (80/60 mmHg) for which, 5 mcg/kg/min of epinephrine drip was started until BP raised up to 100/60 mmHg. On the early morning next day, the nurses reported body movement under sedation and then following spontaneous contractions, a cyanotic fetus was delivered vaginally with Apgar score of 0 (first and 5th minute of the birth). This score did not change after neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Following NVD, O 2 saturation was increased up to 90%; so, another CXR was requested that showed alveolar infiltration as bilateral patchy opacities ( Fig. 1-B) . Following the findings of the new CXR and since the clinical status of the patient was improved, another CT scan was requested for her which illustrated bilateral central consolidation and pleural effusion as new signs. Accordingly, possible ARDS or alveolar hemorrhages were suspected ( Fig. 1-D) . However, regarding the nonspecific findings on the CT scan such as the presence of bilateral pleural effusion ( Fig. 1-D) , increased Cr levels and proteinuria (Table 1) , thrombocytopenia (Table 1) , and evidence of alveolar hemorrhage (bloody mucosal secretions, one session, in the theracheal tube 12 h after intubation, probably due to either alveolar hemorrhage or intubation trauma accompanied with coagulation disorder), our internal medicine team suspected an acute collagen vascular autoimmune disease. Thus, the patient received corticosteroid pulse (methylprednisolone: 1gr) and a single session of emergent plasmapheresis with replacement of 2 L fresh frozen plasma. Following these actions, both neutrophil (count) and lymphocyte (count and ratio) were increased. Although, around afternoon, BP was decreased again and despite 40 mcg/kg/min epinephrine, the systolic pressure did not exceed 90-100 mmHg. After several hours, O 2 saturation was decreased (70-75%) which, despite following all ARDS protocols, did not reach higher than 75% and unfortunately, the patient passed away due to multi-organ failure (ARDS, acute kidney injury, and septic shock). Based on the atypical presentations, the patient underwent sample collection for real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-COVID-2 which was confirmative for COVID-19. Also, she underwent autopsy of lungs. The histologic findings of paraffin embedded lung tissue showed alveolar spaces with focal hyaline membrane, pneumocyte proliferation, and metaplastic changes. Also, viral cytopathic effect including multinucleation and nuclear atypia were noted. The most inflammatory cells present in the background were mononuclear cells composed of lymphocytes and macrophages (Fig. 2) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1962, "end": 1965, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1966, "end": 1969, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1970, "end": 1973, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1977, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1391, "end": 1400, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1434, "text": "Fig. 1-A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 1832, "end": 1841, "text": "Fig. 1-C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 2344, "end": 2352, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 4053, "end": 4062, "text": "Fig. 1-B)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 4353, "end": 4362, "text": "Fig. 1-D)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 4477, "end": 4486, "text": "Fig. 1-D)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 4525, "end": 4534, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 4554, "end": 4563, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 6137, "end": 6145, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Case presentation"}, {"text": "Since 2000, two other outbreaks of coronaviruses have occurred other than COVID-19: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [10] and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [11] .

In the first CT scan, we found some small patchy ground glass opacities with subpleural distribution. Regarding the early initiation epidemic of COVID-19 in Iran, we decided to consider COVID-19 pneumonia as the main diagnosis. However, we also noticed a bilateral pleural thickening in the CT scan.
