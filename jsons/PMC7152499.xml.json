A double-lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) provides the added benefit of isolating the nonoperative lung and airways from any bleeding, which may occur during a potentially bloody resection. The risk of significant bleeding is decreased if the lesion has been embolized before resection. Large-bore intravenous access is recommended in the event significant hemorrhage occurs. An arterial catheter is also indicated to monitor oxygenation and guide resuscitative efforts. An important anesthetic goal is to minimize flow through the pulmonary AV fistula. AV fistulas do not have capillary beds and have lower resistance to blood flow than normal pulmonary vasculature. It is important to avoid a general increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), because this will increase flow through the AV fistula. Similarly, minimizing the use of PEEP will minimize increases in PVR and help minimize blood flow through the pulmonary AV fistula. Because of the risk of paradoxical emboli passing through the fistula, extra caution must be taken to avoid injection of any air or particulate debris into the venous system, because such debris may bypass the pulmonary capillary bed and gain access into systemic arteries where end-organ embolization can occur. Preoperative evaluation should include assessment of neurologic function to rule out prior embolic stroke, and postoperative evaluation should include a neurologic check as well, to look for perioperative CNS embolization.",

Additionally, lesions on the epiglottis or oropharynx may inhibit direct laryngoscopy, despite a normal airway examination.

If the patient is receiving corticosteroids at the time of surgery, stress dosing should be considered.

Diagnosis requires histologic evaluation of a biopsy specimen. It was recently categorized as a lymphoma, although if diagnosed early (grade I angiocentric immunoproliferative lesions) it is considered benign, although premalignant.11 Typically, it presents in the fifth or sixth decade, affecting males twice as often as females. The etiology of LYG is unknown, although the incidence of LYG in patient populations with immune dysfunction, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and organ transplant recipients, is significantly increased when compared with the general population.

LYG is frequently fatal, with 60% to 90% mortality at 5 years, although a small number of patients may undergo spontaneous recovery and complete remission. The cause of death is usually related to extensive destruction of the lungs and resulting respiratory failure.12 Corticosteroids are the treatment of choice, resulting in relief of symptoms such as fever, cough, chest pain, weight loss, and sinusitis. If not diagnosed in the premalignant phase, and if the disease has progressed to lymphoma, chemotherapy is necessary. The combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) is often used. Radiation therapy may be indicated for localized disease.

The presence or potential for peripheral neuropathy in this patient population may deter many anesthesiologists from utilizing regional techniques (i.e., for fear that any subsequent neurologic dysfunction will be assigned to the regional anesthetic technique). However, the choice of anesthetic must be based on a consideration of risks and benefits, and there is no evidence that regional anesthesia worsens LYG. Respiratory compromise increases the risk of hypoxia under general anesthesia or if the patient hypoventilates secondary to sedating medications used for premedication or for monitored anesthesia care. If general anesthesia is chosen, the potential need for postoperative intubation and respiratory support should be addressed with the patient. The need for postoperative mechanical ventilation is more likely in cases of advanced disease with extensive destruction of lung tissue, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax. There is no clear answer to which anesthetic technique is superior, and the approach should be tailored to the individual's comorbidities and surgical procedure.

            "text": "Historically, treatment for PPH relied on oxygen and calcium channel blockers in an effort to decrease pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (Table 4-8\n). In addition, warfarin (Coumadin) is used to reduce the risk of thromboembolism resulting from the enhanced platelet activity seen in PPH. Pulmonary embolism or primary pulmonary vascular thrombosis is poorly tolerated in this patient population. Diuretics and digoxin are also employed when right ventricular failure ensues. More recently, promising results have been achieved with prostaglandins (PGI2, PGE1; alprostadil) and nitric oxide to induce pulmonary vasodilation with minimal systemic effects. These may be used separately or in combination.14 Currently, prostacyclins must be delivered by continuous intravenous infusion owing to their short half-life. Nitric oxide is delivered by inhalation and requires a tank and delivery system. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil and dipyridamole potentiate the pulmonary vasodilation resulting from nitric oxide and can be used separately or in a combined fashion.14 Unfortunately, cost and unwieldy delivery systems have limited the use of these therapies to the short term or the most severe of cases. New approaches to delivering PGI2 are under development, including the inhaled, subcutaneous, and oral routes. Another new agent is bosentan, an oral endothelin receptor antagonist that is thought to inhibit smooth muscle vasoconstriction and proliferation and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat PPH.14\n",

Sinus rhythm is essential to adequate right ventricular filling. Preoperative echocardiography is helpful in determining the extent of right ventricular hypertrophy and function, right atrial enlargement, pulmonic or tricuspid valve dysfunction, and patency of the foramen ovale.

These invasive monitors allow for sampling of arterial blood, pharmacologic manipulation of pulmonary artery pressures and cardiac output, and detection of right ventricular failure, while maintaining adequate ventricular preload. Many different anesthetic techniques have been used successfully in patients with PPH. Regional, epidural, and general anesthesia with controlled ventilation are all reasonable options. Spinal anesthesia may result in a significant reduction in systemic vascular resistance and may precipitate a drop in preload with no change in pulmonary vascular pressures. This may result in inadequate coronary flow to perfuse the right side of the heart, with consequent right ventricular ischemia and failure. Drugs commonly used in the provision of anesthesia are safe in patients with PPH. An exception is nitrous oxide, which has been implicated in raising PVR in several studies.

It is prudent to postpone elective surgery until active alveolar hemorrhage resolves. Evaluating recent chest radiographs for bilateral alveolar infiltrates or new or changing infiltrates will help identify ongoing alveolar hemorrhage. These infiltrates usually resolve 1 to 2 weeks after the bleeding has stopped. Honeycombing may be observed if pulmonary fibrosis has developed. Preoperative spirometry is recommended, because a restrictive pattern develops over the course of the disease. If active bleeding is present, the diffusion capacity will be artificially elevated, owing to absorption by intra-alveolar hemoglobin. Anemia frequently develops from ongoing alveolar hemorrhage, and measuring the amount of serum hemoglobin is essential.",

Fever may result in reduced intravascular volume and an increased metabolic rate. Fluid resuscitation to restore euvolemia before induction will decrease the risk of hemodynamic instability. The increased metabolic rate and increased shunt fraction due to perfusion of inflamed alveoli will increase the speed of desaturation on induction if apnea developes. Excellent preoxygenation and expeditious securing of the airway is therefore essential. Intraoperative ventilator management must be individualized with an effort to minimize airway pressures while delivering adequate volumes. If an obstructive component is present, bronchodilator therapy may be helpful and expiratory times may need to be prolonged.

There appear to be three distinct forms of PAP. Congenital PAP, which presents in infancy, is caused by mutations in the genes coding for surfactant proteins. There is a defect in surfactant-associated protein B (SP-B), which results in accumulation of surfactant-like material in alveoli.28 The secondary form involves decreased alveolar macrophage activity, either functional impairment or decreased number, which may be related to immunosuppression, myeloid disorders, and hematologic malignancies, infection, or inhalation of noxious fumes. There is also an idiopathic categorization, which does not fit into either of the above categories and accounts for 90% of the cases.29 Idiopathic PAP is thought to be due to reduced clearance of surfactant. The proteinaceous material found in the lungs of patients with PAP is surfactant. Patients typically present with gradual onset of cough and worsening dyspnea with exertion. Chest pain, fever, and hemoptysis may also be present. Patients may also have clubbing, cyanosis, and rales. Definitive diagnosis of PAP requires transbronchial or open-lung biopsy.

A rapid decrease in oxygen saturation on induction is common, making excellent preoxygenation and expedient placement of the double-lumen ETT critical. An intra-arterial catheter is useful in monitoring the patient's oxygenation and hemodynamic response to the procedure. Confirmation of correct positioning of the ETT by fiberoptic visualization is appropriate. Testing for leaks that would allow contamination of the ventilated lung by spillage of lavage fluid is essential. Then the nonventilated lung is lavaged repeatedly with saline while the ipsilateral chest wall is mechanically percussed. The procedure is repeated until the drained saline is nearly clear, indicating removal of the majority of the lipoproteinaceous material. The fluid used for the lavage should be warmed to decrease the risk of hypothermia; additionally, the volume of the drainage as well as the presence of bubbles should be closely monitored to ensure isolation of the contralateral lung. Oxygenation may improve during the instillation of fluid as alveolar pressure increases. This results in decreased perfusion to the lavaged lung (which is not being ventilated) and thus improves overall ventilation-perfusion matching. Hypoxia is most likely to occur during the drainage phases of the procedure, when an increase in intrapulmonary shunting occurs due to the dramatic drop in alveolar pressure. Significant hemodynamic changes can also occur during the infusion of the saline into the lung. Hypotension, as well as an increase in central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, is not unusual. Use of transesophageal echocardiography has suggested that these changes were due to impaired venous return to the left side of the heart.32 Presumably, saline infusion compresses alveolar capillaries, increasing pulmonary vascular resistance and resulting in an increase in central venous pressure, while also causing decreased left-sided heart output owing to decreased blood flow to the left ventricle. In some cases the contralateral lung can be lavaged during the same anesthetic, although it is not uncommon to wait several days between treatments. BPL may result in improvement lasting 12 to 18 months before it is again required.",

Vocal cord paralysis has also been reported and is due to recurrent laryngeal neuropathy caused by sarcoid mediastinal lymphadenopathy.37 Encountering a pregnant patient with a history of sarcoid is not unusual, because sarcoid occurs with an increased frequency in women of childbearing age. However, in general, pregnancy tends to improve sarcoid-related symptoms. This is presumably owing to increased cortisol levels during pregnancy.38\n",

Other preoperative testing is guided by the patient's history and may include electrocardiography and echocardiography if cardiac involvement or advanced pulmonary fibrosis is present. All ongoing cardiac therapy should be continued perioperatively.

It may occur in as many as 10 to 20 per 100,000 individuals.49 Several disorders have been implicated as risk factors for developing ARDS, some through direct lung injury, others by a systemic inflammatory response (Table 4-15\n). The underlying lesion is injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane and increased alveolar-capillary permeability. Proteinaceous edema fluid accumulates in the alveoli, resulting in impaired oxygenation and poorly compliant (stiff) lungs. ARDS develops acutely over a 1- to 2-day period. If a patient is alert and spontaneously ventilating, anxiety and dyspnea will be the earliest signs. As inflammatory changes occur, tachypnea and increased work of breathing will be noted. Mechanical ventilation is required to maintain oxygenation. Chest radiographs typically reveal diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates very similar to the findings of pulmonary edema. There is no laboratory test to diagnose ARDS. As a clinical diagnosis, criteria for diagnosing ARDS are acute onset of respiratory distress requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation; a Pao2/FiO2 ratio of less than 200, a chest radiograph with bilateral infiltrates suggestive of pulmonary edema, and no evidence of CHF or, if measured, a pulmonary artery wedge pressure less than 18 mm Hg.50 ARDS has a high mortality rate, which is in the range of 35% to 40%. Patients who do survive generally return to a pulmonary function near their baseline.

Many patients will have a severe underlying injury or illness, which will also require significant attention in the perioperative period. The approach to ventilator management plays a significant role in the mortality rate from ARDS. Instituting low tidal volume ventilation on the order of 4 to 6 mL/kg (predicted body weight) and maintaining plateau pressures of less than 30 cm H2O were found to reduce the mortality from ARDS by almost 20%.52 This approach may result in hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis, which can be treated with sodium bicarbonate. There are currently no data to suggest a particular level of respiratory acidosis, which is dangerous.53 There is no clear evidence to support that pressure-cycled ventilation is superior to volume-cycled ventilation. Administration of PEEP is necessary and results in recruitment of alveoli and better ventilation-perfusion matching. There is no set level of PEEP that has been shown to be superior.54 Other maneuvers such as sigh breaths and periodic rotation of the patient to the prone position may result in improved oxygenation but are not associated with an improvement in outcomes. Invasive monitors will frequently be in place when the patient arrives in the operating room; if not, an intra-arterial catheter should be inserted. For procedures involving major fluid shifts, placement of a pulmonary artery catheter or use of transesophageal echocardiography may be helpful in guiding resuscitation and avoiding overzealous fluid administration, which might adversely impact the patient's respiratory status. Colloids such as albumin and hetastarch offer no advantage over crystalloid solutions because impaired alveolar-capillary membranes allow both classes of fluid to reach the extravascular space.",

Related disorders are Hand-Sch\u00fcller-Christian disease and Letterer-Siwe disease. The primary defect appears to be the pathologic accumulation of Langerhans cells around bronchioles and the pulmonary vasculature, leading to the formation of granulomas and fibrosis. Most PHX patients present in early adulthood and have a history of cigarette smoking; there is equal representation of men and women. Presenting symptoms are nonspecific and include nonproductive cough, dyspnea, fatigue, fever, and weight loss (Table 4-16\n). The presence of reticulonodular infiltrates, of upper and middle lobe cysts, and of stellate nodules with sparing of the costophrenic angle on chest radiography is highly suggestive of PHX. Diagnosis is confirmed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or biopsy. Results of spirometry in this population may yield an obstructive, restrictive, mixed, or normal pattern. A decrease in diffusion capacity appears to be the most consistent finding. Physical limitation in this population is frequently out of proportion to the results of spirometry, and the presence of pulmonary hypertension may play a significant role in contributing to diminished exercise capacity. In advanced disease, pulmonary artery pressures in the range of 60 mm Hg are not unusual.55\n",

Although patient history will provide significant insight into the level of disability, PFTs and ABG analysis are crucial in evaluating the extent of restriction and hypoxemia. This information will guide decisions regarding postoperative ventilatory support. PFTs are likely to demonstrate a reduced vital capacity and total lung capacity, as well as a normal residual volume. Hypoxemia results from ventilation-perfusion inequality. Patients may also hypoventilate. Cor pulmonale resulting from chronic hypoxemia and pulmonary hypertension may be present in advanced cases. These concerns make electrocardiography, echocardiography, and, in some situations, an exercise stress test reasonable components of preoperative testing.

Corrective spine surgery is the procedure that is most likely to bring these patients to the operating room. There are many variations to such procedures, including anterior, posterior, and combined approaches, as well as lumbar and/or thoracic level repairs.

All of these factors make arterial line placement and ABG analysis critical to effective perioperative management. The presence of restrictive lung disease combined with prone or lateral positioning can make oxygenation and ventilation with acceptable peak airway pressures challenging. The use of an anesthesia machine or ventilator capable of pressure control ventilation may be helpful. Based on the level of preoperative disability, the need for postoperative ventilation should be discussed with the patient and family. Of note, adequate oxygenation during one-lung ventilation for anterior thoracic approaches may be difficult. Placement of a double-lumen ETT instead of a bronchial blocker offers the advantage of delivering passive oxygenation to the nonventilated lung. However, such tubes have a disadvantage, which is the need to switch to a single-lumen ETT at the end of the procedure if postoperative ventilation is required. Improvement in the patient's pulmonary function does not occur immediately after surgery, and if any improvement does occur it may take a few months to several years depending on the procedure.69 Large-bore venous access, central or otherwise, is needed to ensure rapid replacement of intraoperative blood loss. Central venous pressure monitoring is of limited usefulness in these procedures owing to the effects of positioning on the values obtained and to the possible presence of pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale, which reduces the value of central venous pressure monitoring in determining the adequacy of intravascular volume. Transesophageal echocardiography is a reasonable choice to monitor intravascular volume status and cardiac contractility if the patient's position allows and if it is available.",

Although effective in treating bacterial and fungal infections, it is not used for these purposes because of its cytotoxicity. The appeal of utilizing bleomycin in combination chemotherapy protocols is that it does not have a myelosuppressive effect. This avoids adding to the bone marrow toxicity common to other antineoplastic agents. Unfortunately, bleomycin carries the risk of inducing pulmonary toxicity, which can result in pulmonary fibrosis and can be life threatening. The risk of a patient developing pulmonary toxicity due to bleomycin therapy appears to be related to several factors. Total dose received has been shown to relate to the extent of pulmonary toxicity in animals, but this relationship is less clear in humans and there is no consensus on a cumulative dose that acts as a threshold for increased risk, although more than 300,000 IU has been suggested.71 Some studies have suggested intravascular administration as a risk factor when compared with intramuscular dosing.72 Chest irradiation in conjunction with bleomycin therapy appears to increase the risk of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, as does advanced age, a history of smoking, and treatment with other chemotherapeutic agents that have pulmonary toxicities, such as busulfan, carmustine, semustine, and lomustine. Impaired renal function increases the risk of toxicity by reducing the elimination of bleomycin from the body.",

This study implicated hyperoxia and fluid overload as factors that increase the risk of perioperative pulmonary morbidity and mortality in patients who have received bleomycin in the past.73 Although there have been subsequent studies that question these guidelines, there is no reason to believe that providing a higher FiO2 than what is needed to maintain adequate oxygenation is of any benefit to these patients. The one exception to this is during preoxygenation, which is relatively brief, before induction of general anesthesia.72 In cases in which adequate oxygenation does require an FiO2 greater than 30%, the use of PEEP is advisable, because it may facilitate oxygen action without necessitating higher levels of FiO2. Fluid therapy should be conservative, with the goal of maintaining adequate intravascular volume and avoiding excess fluid administration. There is no evidence to support the use of colloid instead of crystalloid in this population. For operations in which significant blood loss or significant fluid shifts are expected, intra-arterial and central venous catheters are recommended. There is no clear answer as to how long after completion of therapy with bleomycin a patient continues to be at risk for pulmonary fibrosis, although minimizing FiO2 for an interval of 1 to 2 years would seem prudent.",

Some institutions have taken the added precaution of using personal protection systems (PPS) for personnel involved in high-risk procedures with SARS patients.

The noise generated by the system makes communication difficult.75, 76 Attention must also be directed to avoiding contamination of anesthesia workstations and equipment. This includes placing high-efficiency filters on the inspiratory and expiratory limbs of ventilators and anesthesia machines.

The eggs of the worm are passed in the feces of infested dogs. Humans acquire the infection by unintentionally ingesting the eggs. Larvae then migrate to the liver, with some eventually arriving in the lungs and other tissues. The parasites then mature to form hydatid cysts. The lung forms a protective granulomatous layer around the cyst, which over time becomes fibrotic. It is estimated that hydatid cysts grow 1 to 2 cm a year.77 Due to the fecal-oral transmission, this disease is more common in children than adults. Overall it is rare in North America but common in other parts of the world. These cysts are frequently asymptomatic, and pulmonary cysts are often detected on routine chest radiographs. The most likely symptoms are cough, dyspnea, or chest pain. Rupture of a cyst can occur spontaneously or on surgical manipulation. This may result in an anaphylactic reaction or spread the disease to other organs. For this reason transthoracic needle aspiration should never be attempted. Chest radiographs will reveal a cystic lesion, which may be rather large, accompanied by an area of pneumonitis or atelectasis. There is no effective medical treatment for hydatid cyst of the lung, and surgical removal is the preferred therapeutic option.",

In these very rare circumstances, removal of the cyst has been performed under thoracic epidural anesthesia with success.78 For patients considered reasonable candidates for general anesthesia, one-lung ventilation may be requested to optimize surgical exposure for resection of the cyst. Isolation of the contralateral lung field has the added benefit of decreasing the risk of contamination should the cyst rupture during surgery. In cases in which there is only unilateral disease, there is little reason for the patient to have difficulty tolerating one-lung ventilation, as the unaffected side is primarily responsible for gas exchange if the cyst is clinically significant. An arterial catheter is appropriate when one-lung ventilation is planned. Close communication between surgeon and anesthesiologist during drainage and delivery of the cyst is essential to avoid spillage. In the event of contamination, anaphylaxis may occur and the anesthesiologist should be prepared for this by having large-bore intravenous access, as well as immediate availability of epinephrine, diphenhydramine, and corticosteroids.",
