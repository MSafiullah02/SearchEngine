What social media users post, share, like, and comment on reflects not only what information is available, but also what they consider important. Researchers have used social media data to assess public perceptions, sentiments, and responses toward EID outbreaks such as the 2009 H1N1 outbreak,4 the 2011 European Escherichia coli outbreak,5 the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak,6 and the 2013-2014 measles outbreak in the Netherlands.7 With the exception of Lazard et al,6 all these studies examined social media contents deductively based on pre-existing categories through either manual coding or text mining based on manually coded training dataset. Semantic network of social media contents represents a new lens through which researchers could inductively investigate how the public thinks and feels during an EID outbreak without the need for a training dataset.",

Framing is the process by which organizations and individuals choose to report or discuss an event (such as a public health crisis) by selectively highlighting certain aspects and downplaying other aspects of the event.3 Researchers have explored the frames used by different stakeholders facing a crisis through the examination of semantic networks. David et al10 examined 6 pre-established frames about population issues in news articles in the Philippines by looking at weighted semantic networks between 1986 and 2000. However, a strength of semantic network analysis is it allows new and unfamiliar frames to emerge from the data inductively. For instance, Schultz et al11 studied the associative frames used by public relations professionals and news media in the United States and United Kingdom after the 2010 BP oil spill into the Gulf of Mexico and found that BP framed the oil spill as caused by external factors and downplayed internal factors (such as company's behaviors), whereas the news media adopted more complicated frames. Van der Meer et al12 compared the frames used by public relations professionals, news media, and the public in times of crises such as explosions and volcano eruptions by examining the semantic networks and found the frames used by these groups converged overtime. Tian and Stewart13 compared the semantic networks based on word co-occurrence in CNN and BBC online news report about severe acute respiratory syndrome and found that although both news outlets used the public health frame, CNN used the economic impact frame, and BBC used the outbreak impact frame. Exploring frames during a measles outbreak as indicated by semantic networks by Twitter users can provide insights into how social media users make sense of the crisis and what issues concern them. Hence, the first research question (RQ) was proposed.RQ1: What are the frames used in the Twitter discussion about the 2015 measles outbreak as indicated by semantic networks?\n",

Reynolds and Seeger14 identified a stage-based model of crisis and emergency risk communication, which includes 5 stages: pre-crisis, initial event, maintenance, resolution, and evaluation. Each of these stages is associated with different tasks for crisis communication. Although this model was proposed as a strategic tool for guiding the crisis communication of government agencies such as the CDC, it nevertheless shows that the public goes through different stages in information processing and sensemaking about public health crises such as a measles outbreak. As a result, they are likely to use different frames to discuss measles on Twitter during each stage of the crisis. Hence, we asked the next RQ:RQ2: How does the use of different frames change over different stages of the outbreak?\n",

The pre-crisis stage (stage 1) was between December 1, 2014, and January 4, 2015. The first cases of this outbreak were reported on January 5, which marked the beginning of outbreak and thus the initial stage (stage 2).2 The maintenance stage (stage 3) started on January 28, when the number of new cases started to decline and ended on March 6, when the last case in this break was reported. The resolution stage (stage 4) was between March 7 and April 17, when the CDC announced this outbreak to be officially over.2 Five days were selected for each stage. To be included in the final semantic network, a word or multiword phrase must have appeared in more than 1% of tweets and be involved in the top-60 edges (connections) of each stage filtered based on Jaccard coefficient.15 Jaccard coefficient16 is a statistical measure widely used for assessing similarity between objects (Jaccard, 1912). The values of Jaccard coefficient vary between 0 and 1. In KH Coder, words that appear frequently in the same tweet are considered to be closely associated, and their Jaccard coefficient become closer to 1. To facilitate a more nuanced understanding of the network structure during different stages of outbreak progression, an inductive approach was adopted to identify potential frames based on the high-frequency words and co-occurrence links among them.17 The visualization of the semantic networks was accomplished using Graphviz (http://graphviz.org).",

For example, the groups of words classified as news update frame included California, Disney, Utah, January, visitor, official, and today. The list of words associated with the public health frame included CDC, patient, disease, contract, infectious, and virus, among others. The vaccine frame, which included any mention of vaccine-related issues, was associated with key terms such as vaccine, antivaccine, unvaccinate, unvaccinated, inhaled measles vaccine, safety, immunity, and Jenny McCarthy (an actress often associated with the anti-vaccine movement). Finally, the political frame was associated with terms such as Obama, Republicans, Democrats, immigration, illegal, lawmaker, debate, Governor Christie, and politics.

Radzikowski et al20 studied the tweets about vaccines during the later stages of the 2015 measles outbreak (the maintenance stage in our study) and found around 44% of tweets in their data corpus were retweets. Our data also suggest the highest rate of retweets during this stage, although our data were about measles instead of vaccine.

During the maintenance stage, the vaccine frame became the most frequently used frame, followed by the news update frame, public health frame, and political frame.

            "text": "There are 2 possible explanations for the changes in how measles is framed on Twitter. It is possible that the frames on Twitter are influenced by the frames set by the mainstream media. For instance, Lee and Basnyat21 studied media framing of the 2009 H1N1 outbreak in Singapore and suggested that although traditional media predominantly used the update frame and prevention frame throughout the break, their use of frames diversified to some extent in the later stages of the crisis to include more personal frames and social frames. Our semantic network shows that traditional news media (eg, CNN, CBS, Reuters, and AP) featured prominently in the discussion about the measles outbreak. Future research could examine the intermedia agenda setting process between traditional news media and social media in covering and framing public health crises associated with EIDs to see if Twitter frames are influenced by the frames used in the traditional news media or if the public may influence the frames used by traditional news media through voicing their concerns and opinions in Twitter. The other possible explanation for the changes in the use of frames is psychological. According to the psychometric paradigm, people's response to a risk is decided by the dread, catastrophic potential, controllability, and familiarity of said risk.22 It is possible that during the early stages of a measles outbreak, the public is unsure about the seriousness of the risk and the controllability of the outbreak and therefore prefers the update frame and the public health frame. These 2 frames provide information that can help the public assess the scale and severity of the crisis. However, as the outbreak develops, people perceive the risks associated with measles as more familiar and more controllable. As a result, they start to try to make sense of the crisis by deciding whom they should blame for the outbreak, thereby leading to the increased use of the vaccine frame, which blames parents who refuse to vaccinate their children, as well as the political frame, which blames illegal immigrants or the government for the outbreak. Through surveys, future research could establish the relationship between social media users' risk perception and the frames they apply in discussing EIDs.",

Compared with truth, false news stories only took one-sixth of the time to reach 1,500 people and were 70% more likely to be retweeted.

Further research should compare these different stakeholders' tweets. In addition, it would be of interest to study the retweeting network about EIDs (as done in Radzikowski et al, 2016). Studying the structure of retweeting networks can shed lights on how information and opinion is diffused among Twitter users.
