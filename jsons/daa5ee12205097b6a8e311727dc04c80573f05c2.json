The engagement between the virus and ACE2 appears to be associated with a dysregulation of ACE2, and could lead to acute lung injury. Smoking upregulates the ACE2 receptor, 1 probably explaining why these individuals are more susceptible to coronavirus infection. 2 Similarly, an elegant study demonstrated that the expression of the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase IV [DPP4], was upregulated in the lungs of smokers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, providing further data in favour of this theory. 2 Importantly, there are well-known opposing effects of smoking in ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD].

Ongoing large national and international registries on IBD patients infected with COVID-19 are needed to test this hypothesis and clarify the potential role of smoking in this patient population.",
