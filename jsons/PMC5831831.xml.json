In some critical-type HFRS, the febrile, hypotensive and oliguric phases can overlap, resulting in refractory shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), encephalopathy, severe blood clotting dysfunction and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [5].",

Glucoprotein and proteoglycans (PGs) are principal components of GCX, and PGs has a core of protein, which can connect with negative charge GAG side chain [10]. Syndecans family are major components of PGs, including the CD138, also called syndecan-1, is composed of a ectodomain, a single membrane-spanning domain and a short endochylema domain with phosphorylated site [11, 12]. Under physiopathologic conditions, such as sepsis, chronic inflammation, acute decompensated heart failure and ischemical reperfusion injury [13\u201316], syndecan-1 can be shed from the GCX to the circulating blood as soluble type, which can be considered as an potential marker on predicting prognosis and diagnosis [17, 18].",

The hypotensive phase of HFRS (e.g., low blood pressure and circulation collapse) usually occurs between day 3 and day 7 of the clinical course, and grave HFRS patients can manifest more severe leukemoid reaction, plasma leakage and coagulation disorders [21, 22] compared with septic patients, which would lead to massive bleeding, profound shock, severe tissue hypoperfusion and severe hypoxia, potentially rendering renal, cardiac, cerebellar and hepatic injury [23, 24]. Although there were some studies demonstrated that sCD138 can be considered as a novel marker on predicting prognosis in lung injury and sepsis patients [25\u201327], while as far as we know, until now, there was no research on exploring its expression and relationship with disease severity and prognosis of HFRS.

Analyzing the major reasons, the interval from 2011 to 2013 was a period of city economy development, and the real estates construction led to destroyed ecological environment usually accompanied with the destruction of the rodents\u2019 life cycle and environment, which cause a large numbers of rodents, especially the Apodemus agrarius, major source of infection, immigrate to the colonized region of the human and cause infection; furthermore, the negligence of HFRS vaccine injection in time on that interval was another reason. In the last 3 years, with the caution of local epidemiological investigation and active immunity of HFRS vaccine injection on population with inoculation rate above 85%, the HFRS incidence was obviously low. While, we should also be pay attention to the next large epidemic interval of HFRS in this region considering the descending valence of vaccine (usually sustain 3\u20135 years).",
