Coronaviruses infect humans and various animal species, causing respiratory, gastrointestinal and neurological diseases as well as hepatitis. Prominent examples include the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), middle-eastern respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) and the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), to name a few.",

The family Coronaviridae is currently divided into four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus.

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with the largest RNA genome of approximately 30 kb reported to date. The genomic RNA includes 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR), and it is capped and polyadenylated. Open reading frame (ORF) 1a and ORF1ab occupy the 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome and encode two replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab). Expression of pp1ab protein requires a ribosomal frameshift during translation of the genomic RNA. Produced polyproteins are proteolytically cleaved into 16 nonstructural proteins, nsp1 through nsp16 by the proteinase activity of nsp3 and nsp5. The 3\u2032-proximal one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Some betacoronaviruses have an additional membrane protein, hemagglutinin esterase (HE). Interspersed between these genes are genes encoding accessory proteins. The number of these genes varies between different coronaviruses. For instance, TGEV has 3 accessory genes, PDCoV has 2, whereas PEDV has only one (Fig. 1\n).",

            "text": "The viral RNA genome is packaged by the N protein into a helical nucleocapsid. In addition to the structural role, the N protein prolongs S-phase cell cycle, induces endoplasmic reticulum stress, up-regulates interleukine-8 expression and antagonizes type I interferon production (Ding et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2013b). The S protein, which forms peplomers on the virion surface, mediates binding to host receptors and membrane fusion. It can be divided into S1 and S2 domains. In some coronaviruses the S protein is processed into S1 and S2 fragments by cellular proteases or trypsin (Belouzard et al., 2012, Wicht et al., 2014). The S protein is a major target for virus neutralizing antibodies (Chang et al., 2002, Reguera et al., 2012). The M protein is the most abundant virion component and also contains conserved linear B-cell epitopes (Zhang et al., 2012). The E protein is responsible for the assembly of virion, and it causes endoplasmic reticulum stress and interleukin-8 expression up-regulation (Xu et al., 2013a). Accessory genes are dispensable for virus growth in vitro, but they may play an important role in the virus survival in the infected host. Indeed, the product of the TGEV accessory gene ORF7 reduces the expression of genes involved in the antiviral defense of the immune system, e.g. the interferon response, and inflammation (Cruz et al., 2011). The ORF3 protein of PEDV functions as an ion channel, and it is thought to be related with virulence of PEDV (Song et al., 2003, Wang et al., 2012). One of the PEDV non-structural proteins, nsp1, was shown to be a type I interferon suppressor (Zhang et al., 2016a). Interestingly, PDCoV lacks the nsp1 gene.",

PEDV also infection Goblet cells in the small intestine (Jung and Saif, 2015). In addition, infection of alveolar macrophages and lamina propria macrophages has been shown for some but not all swine coronaviruses (Laude et al., 1984, Park and Shin, 2014). Entrance of the virus into the target cells is mediated by a series of receptor ligand interactions including heparin sulfate (Huan et al., 2015) and aminopeptidase N (APN) (Chen et al., 1996, Li et al., 2007). Importantly, the expression levels of aminopeptidase N appear to correlate with the level of infection, at least for PEDV. The higher the expression levels the more severe is the infection (Li et al., 2007, Zhang and Yoo, 2016). As a result, it may be perceivable that piglets born with lower APN levels in the brush border may be more resistant to PEDV than piglets with higher levels.",

Diarrhea can be found within 24 to 36 h post infection depending on the dose of the virus and the age of the piglets. Diarrhea typically lasts for about 5-8 days, but can last longer, and results in severe weight loss that often cannot be made up during the normal production cycle. Viral shedding is highest between days 3\u20135, but can last for days to weeks post infection. Surviving piglets start to recover around 6\u20138 days post infection, typically around the same time when proliferation of the crypt epithelium and regeneration of the villi occurs. Similarly, TGEV infects villous enterocytes and causes disease that clinically is indistinguishable from PEDV. Mortality rates are highest in young piglets, often reaching about 100%. In contrast, infection with PDCoV causes milder infections in piglets between 3 and 5 weeks of age. Diarrhea, vomiting and anorexia can be found in infected animals.

Pigs can produce three types of interferons (Sang et al., 2014): Type I interferons include well known interferons such as interferon \u03b1 and \u03b2 (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and in pigs are encoded by as many as 17 different genes. The only type II interferon in pigs is IFN-\u0263. Type III interferons include IFN-\u03bb1 (interleukin 29; IL-29), IFN-\u03bb2 (IL-28A), IFN-\u03bb3 (IL-28B) and IFN-\u03bb4 (Kotenko et al., 2003, Park et al., 2012, Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013, Sheppard et al., 2003, Zhang and Yoo, 2016). Their functions are unknown in pigs. Especially type I and III interferons are used by the host to counteract viral infections. In response, most viruses including PEDV and TGEV have developed strategies to evade and interfere with the interferon response. Several viral proteins, including structural and non-structural proteins have been identified for PEDV and TGEV that can suppress the interferon response. For an excellent review on the evasion of immunity by porcine coronaviruses please see (Zhang and Yoo, 2016).",

These include secretory IgA antibodies (SIgA) that are produced by antibody-secreting cells in the lamina propria of the mucosal tissues and systemic antibodies such as IgG and IgM are found in serum and interstitial tissues and some isotypes can be transsudated across the mucosal epithelium into the lumen (Chattha et al., 2015, Horton and Vidarsson, 2013). The cellular response to swine coronaviruses is characterized by T helper cells that are supporting the production of antibodies and cytotoxic T cells that are targeting virus infected epithelial cells. In pigs, these are predominantly \u0263\u0257-cells, most of which can be found within the intraepithelial layer (Bonneville et al., 2010). The majority of T cell epitopes are located in the Spike and nucleoprotein of coronaviruses (Channappanavar et al., 2014, Saif, 2004, Sestak et al., 1999). Additionally, CD8 T cell epitopes have been found in the membrane protein of the human SARS-CoV (Yang et al., 2006)",

            "text": "In neonatal piglets, the main mechanism of protection is mediated by lactogenic immunity. During lactation, SIgA, IgG and IgM are passively transferred to the piglet via colostrum and milk (Bohl and Saif, 1975, Saif and Bohl, 1979, Saif and Bohl, 1983, Salmon et al., 2009). Colostrum contains predominantly IgG, which is transudated from sow serum and absorbed by the piglet within the first 24\u201348 h of life. Secretory IgA is predominantly found in milk, after transitioning from colostrum to milk around 3\u20134 days of age (Langel et al., 2016). SIgA is produced by antibody secreting cells in the mammary gland, and it was shown many years ago by Bohl and Saif (Bohl et al., 1972a) that these cells migrate from the gut to the mammary gland at the end of pregnancy. This was confirmed by others in a variety of species and chemokines such as CCL28 and others have been found responsible for recruiting these antibody secreting cells to the mammary gland (Bourges et al., 2008, Lazarus et al., 2003, Meurens et al., 2006, Meurens et al., 2007, Wilson and Butcher, 2004). Thus, in order to enhance the level of maternal immunity the oral route seems to be the most obvious choice for vaccinating the sow. Indeed, most vaccines for enteric coronaviruses are designed to induce lactogenic immunity by vaccinating the sow, however, most of them are administered via systemic injection. In the absence of effective vaccines for PEDV, many producers are currently using a lock-down of the barn combined with feeding back infectious live virus to pregnant sows. However, the duration of immunity often does not extent more than a few years (Table 1\n), depending on the type of vaccine being used with live vaccines typically providing longer lasting immunity. Even after feed-back, immunity starts to wane after a relatively short period of time, often even less than a few months. For an excellent review of the role of lactogenic immunity for PEDV see (Langel et al., 2016). In addition to antibodies, the colostrum also contains innate effector molecules such as defensins and antimicrobial peptides, interleukins and cytokines (Bandrick et al., 2014, Hlavova et al., 2014, Mair et al., 2014, Nechvatalova et al., 2011, Salmon et al., 2009).",

In this experiment the sows were challenged with a more virulent PEDV virus at day 109 of gestation, and orally re-challenged when the piglets were three days old. None of the sows displayed significant clinical symptoms. The piglets were orally challenged with 1 ml of mucus scrapings of the more virulent PEDV.

By administration to sows, the importance of lactogenic immunity was established (Bohl et al., 1972b, Saif and Bohl, 1983). However, with a disappearance of the disease in many parts of the world, fewer vaccines are now commercially available in North America and Europe (Table 2\n). Most current commercial TGEV vaccines are live attenuated vaccines that are given to the sow during gestation in order to provide lactogenic immunity to the newborn piglet. These vaccines are often available as bi- or trivalent vaccines combined with rotavirus, PEDV and/or Escherichia coli. Experimental vaccines include novel DNA vaccines, vectored vaccines and recombinant vaccines (Table 1). For example, the porcine adenovirus was used to deliver the TGEV spike protein (Tuboly and Nagy, 2001). Yuan et al. used the swine pox virus to express the A epitope of the spike protein (Yuan et al., 2015). DNA plasmids were generated for both PEDV and TGEV for the development of a DNA vaccine (Meng et al., 2013). Recombinant proteins (spike and nucleocapsid) have been extensively evaluated as recombinant vaccine following expression in bacteria, yeast and plants. Many of these are being assessed for their potential to mucosal immunity after oral administration.",

The technology is a propagation defective, single cycle RNA particle technology that is believed to target dendritic cells. A longer version of the spike genes was codon optimized and used in the second-generation vaccine called iPED plus, which now is commercially available as Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Vaccine, RNA (PED RNA). The vaccine induced immunity in young pigs after two doses given intramuscularly in a three-week interval. Vaccinated weaned pigs when challenged with homogenized gut tissue from a clinical isolate displayed significantly reduced severity of clinical signs (diarrhea) and reduced viral shedding for the first 72 h (Mogler et al., 2014a). Vaccine efficacy was further tested in na\u00efve sows. After three vaccinations at 8, 5, and 1 weeks pre-farrowing piglets from both groups were challenged between 2 and 6 days of age with 103 TCID50 (PEDV/CO/2013). Average litter mortality in the control group was 91%, while average mortality in the vaccinated groups was 69% (Crawford et al., 2015). Similar results were found in sows previously exposed to PEDV. After oral challenge of piglets within the first week average litter mortality was reduced from 59% in the control group to 45% in the vaccinated group. Finally, Greiner et al. (2015) evaluated the vaccine in 80 sows that had been previously exposed to PEDV. Vaccination induced higher titers against the S1 protein in the colostrum of vaccinated sows and reduced overall pig mortality by 3% (Greiner et al., 2015).",

The vaccine was safe and immunogenic and induced neutralizing antibodies to both the whole virus and the spike protein (Frederickson et al., 2014). The vaccine was also tested under field conditions in a PEDV positive commercial herd. Sows (n = 120) were vaccinated at 5- and 2 weeks pre-farrowing, control sows (n = 120) received placebo. Vaccination resulted in reduction of pre-weaning mortality due to PEDV from 6.3% in piglets born to control sows versus 0.6% in piglets born to vaccinated sows. Vaccination resulted in about 3 times higher neutralization antibody titers compared to the control group, and an additional 1.8 pigs per sows survived (Rapp-Gabrielson et al., 2014).",

The vaccine is based on inactivated virus formulated with an adjuvant. When administered to seronegative sows 4 and 2 weeks prior to farrowing, high levels of neutralizing antibodies against PEDV were found in colostrum and milk, as well as in the serum of piglets born to vaccinated sows. Piglets were orally infected at 5 days of life with 300 pfu of PEDV isolate CO 025. It was found that 95% of all piglets (n = 83) born to vaccinated sows survived the infection and showed significantly reduced clinical symptoms, weight loss and viral shedding. In contrast, all piglets from unvaccinated sows displayed severe clinical symptoms including weight loss and dehydration, and 50% of these piglets died within 6 days post infection. These results were confirmed in two additional clinical trials. A large field trial involving > 600 sows was performed in three commercial units in Saskatchewan, Canada to assess the vaccine in different genetics, health statuses and management systems. The vaccine demonstrated to be completely safe to use; no adverse events including injection site reactions and reproductive complications were observed. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated in 8% of these animals by transporting the pregnant sows a week before farrowing to the VIDO-InterVac high containment facility. Following oral challenge at 5 days of age, survival was significantly higher in piglets born to vaccinated sows than those from control sows (Berube et al., 2015). The assessment of duration of immunity is currently ongoing. In addition, an affinity tagged PEDV S1 protein was expressed in the HEK293 system to be used as subunit vaccine. When administered to pregnant sows the vaccine partially protected newborn piglets against infection with PEDV (Makadiya et al., 2016).",

Each group can be further divided into two subgroups: 1a and 1b, 2a and 2b, respectively. It is also possible that the low to moderate effectiveness of current PEDV vaccines are due to genetic differences between vaccine and field epidemic strains (Kim et al., 2015).",

In addition, the DNA vaccines induced a high level of IFN-\u03b3 in the immunized mice. At 35 days post-immunization, the recombinant DNA plasmids bearing full-length S genes of TGEV and PEDV stimulated high levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies. Zhang et al.

            "text": "With the disappearance of TGEV around the world, the need for TGEV vaccines has dropped over the last few years. For North America and Europe, only two major international animal health companies continue to offer TGEV vaccines. In contrast, many parts of Asia including China and Korea are still dealing with TGEV outbreaks, and different types of vaccines are still available. The introduction of PEDV into the North American herd in 2013\u20132014, however, has reversed this picture and has highlighted the global need for effective vaccines. Coronaviruses represent an important group of animal pathogens that can have devastating impacts in a variety of species. For an industry to rely on biosecurity alone seems somewhat risky and, in case of an emerging disease, can lead to major economic losses, as witnessed in North America over the last two years. Indeed, the phylogeny of coronaviruses demonstrates a great deal of diversity in antigenic variants, which may lead to limited cross-protection against infection with different strains. Thus, it is important to continue to survey novel PEDV variants that may emerge locally or globally through antigenic drift (point mutations) or antigenic shift (recombination events).",

            "text": "Effective prevention and control of PEDV and other coronaviruses can only be achieved through the use of vaccines. An ideal vaccine prevents mortality and clinical disease in newborn piglets, the age group most seriously affected by the disease, as well as viral shedding. As lactogenic immunity is a key mechanism of protection, efforts to enhance the levels of antibodies in the milk through formulation (adjuvants) and delivery (mucosal) are critical. However, time is also of essence when dealing with a new strain, as traditional manufacturing vaccine methods like virus isolation, inactivation or attenuation can be time-consuming. Therefore, research on next-generation vaccines such as RNA particle, DNA, sub-unit and viral-vectored approaches is critical for the prevention of future outbreaks of emerging coronavirus diseases.",
