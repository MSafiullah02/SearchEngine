Since the total number of people infected by the virus is uncertain, we have considered the trend of ICU patients, ICU patients plus deaths, and finally the sum of hospitalized patients plus the deceased. The growth of the corresponding curves is similar for all the three graphs while the trend after the turning point is completely different. We find that the curve of ICU patients can be a useful tool to monitor the behavior of epidemic and a model to predict the future evolution of COVID-19.",

Not many days later, an Italian man was hospitalized and confirmed as a third case. Unfortunately, the virus began to spread and in early March all Italian regions had been infected. Moreover, ICU (Intensive Care Unit) patients began to increase and on February 22nd there was the first official case of death caused by the virus. This series of dramatic events has forced the Italian Government to take, from the month of March, a series of restrictive measures. In other words, a national quarantine was imposed limiting the possibility of people movements, except in cases of extreme necessity. The first lockdown initially concerned some \"red zones\" in the northern part of Italy, but it was gradually extended to the entire country. We have analyzed the official data provided by the Italian Civil Protection starting from March 2nd to May 1st [1] . The data of Deaths occurred on May 2nd are not correct because, following the interviews released by members of Italian task force, 282 deaths registered for May 2nd are, on the contrary, relative to the last days of April but they have not specified the details of this error, so it is possible that the data of deaths for April 30th and May 1st are slightly underestimated (for the same reason the number of total deaths registered in the table of March 26th were corrected from 8165 to 8215). Anyway, we have decided to interrupt our statistical analysis also considering the fact that for May 4th the 1 beginning of a new phase is fixed, with less restrictive rules for people movements. The change of boundary conditions, obviously, will cause a correspondent change in the statistical curves.",

The numbers regarding people who tested positive for the virus are certainly unrealistic. There are many asymptomatic but infected people that are not counted by the official data, because they have not been discovered as positive to a test. The amount of this hidden cases is unknown. It is generally overestimated when the analysis regards the percentage of deaths compared to the infected. Actually, on May 2nd there were in Italy 209328 total cases with 28710 deaths. So, the mortality rate is 13.7% and it is too high, but considering a great number of hidden infected people, the mortality rate decreases and becomes in agreement with the one of other countries. On the contrary the infected that were not detected are underestimated when the analysis is done to show that their number is too low to achieve herd immunity in a short time. For this reason we have analyzed the data that seem more solid like the hospitalized patients (hospitalized patients with symptoms and patients in ICU) and the deceased, even if, especially in some areas of Lombardia, the number of deaths is clearly underestimated. In particular, the great numbers of ICU patients and deceased are important data also because they represent the peculiarity of COVID-19 with respect to the evolution of a virus of the annual well known flu.",

The values of the three parameters of the best fit function are reported in Table 1 . Regarding some long term forecasts, from the analysis of the first step ( Fig.1) , the extrapolation from the experimental data allows to predict a peak for the curve a for day 30 (i.e. March 30th), for the curve b for day 37 (i.e. April 6th) and for the curve c for day 34 (i.e. April 3rd). This prediction appears reasonable and in agreement with what we expected.
