Serum antibodies are also polyclonal and frequently polyspecific, even when purified over an antigen column, rendering them suboptimal for the specific recognition of a single component in a complex matrix. One illuminating study has demonstrated that when used to probe a comprehensive yeast proteome chip, unpurified polyclonal antibody preparations could recognize up to 1770 different proteins, with some monoclonal antibodies and antigen column-purified polyclonal antibodies also recognizing multiple proteins (related and unrelated) [3].",

            "text": "The arrival of monoclonal antibody technology [4] was a major step forward in generating high-specificity reagents, but the reliance on the murine immunoglobulin system frequently leads to a number of practical difficulties: (1) Monoclonal antibodies are raised on the basis of an inefficient fusion of splenic B-cells to an immortalized mouse myeloma line, followed by limiting dilution of the cell population. Target-specific antibodies are randomly identified, often by a simple direct ELISA, where few preconditions can be set to determine which antibodies are identified and one must \u201ctake what one can get\u201d during the screening process. (2) It is often desirable to have multiple monoclonal antibodies with specificity for different epitopes on the same target molecule, but the difficulty in sequencing monoclonals does not allow the rapid identification of unique clones early in the screening process. (3) Humans and rodents are relatively closely related phylogenetically. Many proteins of interest are highly conserved among mammals and this can frequently lead to thymic tolerance, restricting the antibody response after immunization. (4) When an immune response to a human protein is raised in mice, the large regions of sequence similarity between murine and human proteins may lead to a restricted number of immunogenic epitopes. (5) To generate antibodies that cross-react with orthologues from multiple species of mammal is particularly tricky, as the common epitopes among mammals are the very ones that are unlikely to provoke a strong immunoglobulin response in the mouse. (6) Tolerance issues can become even harder to circumvent when the protein of interest is from a mouse or rat. Creating \u201cknockout\u201d mice, in which the endogenous copy of the gene for the target protein has been disabled, can often break tolerance, but this is a highly laborious and time-consuming process that few laboratories have the resources to undertake. These factors all hinder the generation of high-quality antibody reagents and thereby limit one\u2019s experimental options when developing antibodies for purifying or tracking novel proteins.",

The simplest and most commonly used fragment is the single-chain fragment variable (scFv) where a flexible peptide sequence links the V-regions of antibodies between the C-terminus of one domain and the N-terminus of the other, thereby combining both V-domains into a single polypeptide [20]. The scFv may be assembled in VL\u2013VH or VH\u2013VL orientations, with VH\u2013VL being the most heavily used format historically. The flexible linker helps to make the scFv simple to express, but must be sufficiently long and flexible to allow effective association of the V-regions to form a functional antigen-combining site. As long as this is true, the classical hydrophobic pairing of the V-regions will stabilize the structure. By far, the most common linkers are based on glycine\u2013serine repeat structures such as GGGGS \u00d7 3.",

Fabs obligately form predominantly monomeric, monovalent fragments. They are the most \u201cnatural\u201d of the recombinant antibody fragments and it has been shown that the presence of the constant regions can often help to stabilize antibody variable regions [22]. The Fab format is the less commonly used of the two main recombinant antibody formats, however, as its dual polypeptide structure is generally more difficult to express and display in E.\ncolithan the scFv [22]. A recent engineered scFab platform however attempts to address some of the limitations associated with scFab expression [23].",

Unfortunately, these forays into display technologies have often left investigators somewhat disappointed. Many people have accepted the viewpoints of recombinant antibody technology experts, that these libraries can yield useful high-affinity antibodies to any form of antigen. In general, (mostly to those highly skilled in the field), this is indeed true, but the average antibody generated from these libraries is often of disappointingly low affinity to those who are used to high-sensitivity antibodies from immunized sources. Human recombinant antibodies from na\u00efve library sources can require technically challenging in vitro molecular evolution if they are to perform the demanding \u201creal world\u201d functions required of many reagent antibodies [9]. Molecular evolution is far from trivial to perform and is usually beyond both the scope and interest level of the average researcher. For such reasons, it is of little wonder then that most people either ignore, or at worst disparage, phage display technology itself.",

While the most successful na\u00efve antibody libraries contain over 1010 members and are often the domain of biotechnology companies, typical immune libraries are in the 107\u2013108 range and are easily assembled by a single investigator [24, 25]. When an immunized rabbit or sheep has raised a significant serum immunoglobulin titer, the common end-point to the experiment is to exsanguinate the animal and harvest the serum. However, harvesting B-cell rich lymphoid tissues from the animal, such as the spleen and bone marrow, allows the isolation of total RNA and the subsequent generation of cDNA [24]. This is a simple method with which many biomedical researchers are familiar, and commercial kits are available to simplify most steps of the process.",

Diversity in the V-regions is created by both V\u2013D\u2013J recombination and somatic hypermutation, with the additional influence of \u201cgene conversion,\u201d where multiple upstream pseudogenes are recombined into the functional sequence. This germline V-gene system means that the entire chicken antibody repertoire can be captured using only four PCR primers [47], making chicken libraries highly representative of the induced immunoglobulin response. This is in direct contrast with immune hosts such as mice, which have diverse germline V-gene sequences and therefore require complex mixes of PCR primers [24]. Additionally, the two V-gene germline sequences found in chickens are highly homologous to the human V\u03bb and VH3 germline families [48], which are both associated with creating V-domains with high stability and solubility. Indeed, chicken scFvs can be stable in crude bacterial culture supernatants for up to 1 month at room temperature [49].",

While this small library was nonimmune and derived from the bursa cells of a single young chicken, the group was able to select target-specific scFv sequences recognizing lysozyme, serum albumin and thyroglobulin. The potential of chicken recombinant antibodies was further highlighted by a study [50] which used an scFv library derived from the spleens of immunized chickens and successfully generated highly specific scFv antibodies that targeted both mouse and rat serum albumins, where tolerance issues limit the ability to generate murine monoclonal antibodies. In addition, an in-depth analysis of the avian immunoglobulin VH repertoire demonstrated that na\u00efve repertoire features were fully replicated in the resulting target-selected, phage display repertoire [2].",

More recent studies have shown that scFv antibodies derived from immunized chickens are highly effective reagents in diverse settings such as diagnostic ELISA for Infectious Bursal Disease Virus [51], the diagnosis of prion disease [52], immunodetection of haptenic shellfish toxins [53], immunostaining of SARS-infected cells [54], biosensing of cardiac biomarkers [55], and the measurement of ApoB protein in mouse and human sera [56]. Raats et al. [57] have also illustrated that anti-idiotype scFvs from an immune chicken scFv library were of considerably higher sensitivity than those derived from a human antibody library in the same study. The generation of highly selective scFvs toward the PrP protein, which is highly conserved in mammals demonstrates the advantage of the chicken as an immune model, as isolated scFvs were shown to react with murine, ovine, and bovine orthologues of the protein [52].",

The target proteins of interest are mixed in a single adjuvant preparation and each immunized animal receives all multiplexed proteins simultaneously. Spleen and bone marrow tissues from the immunized animals are then used to generate relatively small phage display libraries and specific antibodies are derived via selection of the library separately on the individual proteins originally used for immunization [37]. The immunized chickens appear to react to the proteins fully independently, as the phage display libraries generate individual scFv antibody clones that are fully specific by western blot and ELISA, showing no reactivity to their co-immunogens [37, 59]. This approach has major benefits practically and ethically, as it allows the use of a single library to derive high-affinity antibodies to a group of proteins of interest. Multi-immunization methods also simultaneously minimize animal use and raise the likelihood of success in generating an immediately useful reagent [37, 59].",

Firstly, the simplest scenario combines multiple unrelated proteins, which leads to unrelated B-cell responses after immunization. To derive antibodies of greatest specificity during a multi-target immunization of this kind, it is important to ensure that each of the protein immunogens is highly purified and that no closely related proteins are co-immunized into a single animal. Secondly, to derive antibodies that are cross-reactive to orthologues of a conserved protein from multiple species, it is likely to be beneficial, but not necessarily essential, to include each orthologue in the mix of immunogens given to each animal. Iterative selection rounds that change orthologue each time can then be used to bias toward the isolation of cross-reactive antibodies.",

A similar method was proven to be efficient in the production of Fabs that are specifically biotinylated in vivo during bacterial expression, via C-terminal fusion of the Fabs to the E.\ncoliacetyl-CoA carboxylase [65]. Importantly, these biotinylated Fabs were successfully used to purify recombinant TNF-alpha from bacterial lysates, via a streptavidinated column.

These thiol groups can then be used to covalently couple the fragment to a thiol-activated surface [68]. More elegant versions of this approach have expressed antibody fragments with a C-terminal cysteine group, then gently applied the same chemistry, to preferentially reduce the exposed disulphide groups [61]. The exposed terminal thiols are again an efficient reactive group for covalent attachment.

In cases where stable linkage has been achieved and the column is to be reused, it is prudent for the investigator to examine multiple clones for their stability under repeated cycles of elution and regeneration. While chicken scFvs are built upon naturally stable frameworks, the stability of different clones cannot be taken for granted. In cases where stability remains an issue, the appropriate chicken V-regions can be cloned into an Fc-fusion [70] or IgG [71] expression vector to produce full-length antibody in mammalian, yeast, and even plant culture systems [72].",
