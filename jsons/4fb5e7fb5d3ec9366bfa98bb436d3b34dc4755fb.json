Here, we demonstrate that USP18 expression is induced by HIV-1 in a T1 IFN-dependent manner. Experimental depletion of USP18 by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) gene editing results in a significant restriction of HIV-1 replication in an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived macrophage model. In the absence of USP18, macrophages have increased responsiveness to stimulation with T1 IFNs with prolonged phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 and increased expression of IFN-stimulated genes that are key for antiviral responses. Interestingly, HIV-1 requires some signaling through the T1 IFN receptor to replicate efficiently because a neutralizing antibody that inhibits T1 IFN activity reduces HIV-1 replication rate in monocyte-derived macrophages. USP18 induction by HIV-1 tunes the IFN response to optimal levels allowing for efficient transcription from the HIV-1 LTR promoter while minimizing the T1 IFN-induced antiviral response that would otherwise restrict viral replication and spread. Finally, iPSC and CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting offer a powerful tool to study host factors that regulate innate immune responses.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] In clinical trials treating human patients with recombinant IFN-2a, T1 IFNs can suppress viral replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in some patients. 6, 7 However, this approach failed in long-term treatment when study subjects became refractory to IFN treatment and viral loads returned to previous levels. T1 IFNs are important in establishing early control of HIV-1 in an in vivo SIV rhesus macaque model, 8 Signaling through IFNAR results in the phosphorylation and activation of STAT proteins including STAT1 and STAT2. The consequence of STAT1/2 phosphorylation is induced expression of hundreds of ISGs. [15] [16] [17] The protein products of ISGs then target host and viral machinery as a means to restrict viral replication. However, a small subset of the ISGs expressed are negative feedback mechanisms that turn off IFN signaling so that resolution of the immune response can occur.",

Macrophages play an important role in this process and can act as mediators of inflammation. 33 , 34 We recently reported that HIV-1 replication in macrophages requires activity of STAT1, a protein usually associated with antiviral responses. 35 The role of STAT1 was in postintegration expression of HIV-1 mRNA from the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. This paradoxical mechanism where HIV-1 usurps antiviral pathways as a means of driving its own replication suggests that a complex host-pathogen interplay ultimately determines if HIV-1 can efficiently replicate in macrophages. In general, the role of macrophages in the HIV-1 life cycle is important because eliminating persistently infected macrophages in addition to latently infected T cells will be necessary for a sterilizing cure to be achieved.

Instead, we utilized shRNA knockdown of USP18 in the THP-1 cell line. THP-1 cells are suspension cells that can be differentiated into adherent macrophage-like cells with PMA treatment. They are a well-established model system for studying HIV-1 infection in macrophages. 52 We generated THP-1 cell lines that constitutively express nontargeting control or USP18-specific shRNA (Supplemental Figs.

            "text": "We report here that USP18 deficiency restricts HIV-1 replication in human macrophages using an iPSC model. The restriction on replication was due to an enhanced IFN response from a lack of feedback inhibition on the JAK/STAT pathway resulting in increased expression of ISGs that have antiviral effects. Previous work done by our group has shown that STAT1 and STAT3 are necessary for efficient HIV-1 replication. Blocking phosphorylation of either of these 2 molecules resulted in significant reduction in viral replication. 35 However, the current study shows that increasing the amount of phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 also results in a significant reduction in viral replication. Thus, we propose that USP18 acts as a tuning mechanism which prevents a robust IFN response that would restrict viral replication (Fig. 9) . Previous work has shown that Usp18 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit protection from intracerebral infection by LCMV and VSV. 55 Usp18 \u2212/\u2212 mice also The basis of antibacterial protection in USP18 deficiency can be attributed to hypersensitivity to LPS as a consequence of an overactive T1 IFN response. 56 Mechanistically, these studies showed that USP18 deficiency resulted in increased ISGylation of proteins and increased phosphorylated STAT1 levels in response to LPS treatment or viral infection. It was based on these properties that we sought to determine if human USP18 regulates HIV-1 replication. supports HIV-1 replication is a window of low level immune activation that is due, at least in part, to balanced positive and negative regulators of antiviral immunity (Fig. 9 ). Infected cells eventually become refractory to T1 IFN signaling due to induction of negative regulators such as USP18. Other negative regulators are also induced by T1 IFNs including SOCS1, SOCS3, and PIAS. 75 We focused on USP18 for this study due to its additional function as a deISGylating enzyme and its appearance in gene expression profiling experiments following HIV-1 infection.

If the protein is phagocytosed and processed by acidic proteases, it will be digested freeing the fluorophore and quencher allowing for fluorescence. iMacs fed DQ-OVA were positive for BOD-IPY FL dye indicating that ovalbumin was processed by acidic proteases (SupplementalFig. S3C).

This is consistent with work done in murine USP18-deficient macrophages treated with IFN-that demonstrated an increase in genes involved in antigen processing and presentation, cytokines and chemokines, as well as genes involved in responses to viral infections.60 In mice, in vivo protection from viral infections is mediated by Usp18 through a mechanism known as enforced viral replication whereby marginal zone macrophages become resistant to the effects of T1 IFN.61 By shielding macrophages from the full antiviral effects of T1 IFN, the cells can express viral proteins and utilize those proteins to prime adaptive T cell-mediated immunity. HIV-1 seems to have exploited this property of USP18 as a means of tuning the antiviral response to favor its own replication. ISG15 and ISGylation of proteins has been previously shown to be important in restricting many different viruses including VSV, HIV-1, HCV, Chikungunya, Influenza A, Influenza B, LCMV, and Sindbis viruses. 62,63 Previous studies have shown that ISGylation is important for restricting HIV-1 in 293T, U1.1, HOS-CD4/CXCR4, HeLa, U2OS, and 293E cell lines. 23,64,65 However, we are unaware of any studies showing the relevance of ISGylation in primary cells or nonimmortalized cells such as human MDMs or human T cells. Moving forward, a key area of focus should be determining which functional domains of USP18 are required for HIV-1 replication to dissect the relative roles of deISGylation versus IFNAR blocking in this process. We have demonstrated in USP18 deficient cells that the first round of HIV-1 infection is unaffected. The virus enters target cells, reverse transcribes cDNA, and integrates its proviral genome into a host chromosome. This likely results because during the first round of infection, de novo T1 IFN synthesis lags the rapid proviral integration process. Following this initial infection and more prolonged spreading infection in culture, USP18 \u2212/\u2212 cells will likely have reduced net proviral integration as the initial T1 IFN response is amplified in these cells. After sensing viral nucleic acids in the infected cells, IFNs are produced and secreted into the surrounding environment. Indeed, we see that T1 F I G U R E 6 CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of USP18 in iPSCs.

A low-level IFN response in the presence of IFNAR neutralizing antibodies characterized by low levels of phosphorylated STAT1/2 and low expression of ISGs limits HIV-1 replication. In the absence of USP18, a strong IFN response characterized by high levels of phosphorylated STAT1/2 and high expression of ISGs also limits HIV-1 replication. In the presence of USP18, the optimal levels of phosphorylated STAT1/2 and ISG expression allows for robust HIV-1 replicationreplication in vivo, but only if certain elements of the ISG response are limited. Negative regulators serve an important cellular function by limiting the magnitude of an initial response or helping to resolve a response following early signaling events. Here we show how HIV-1 capitalized on the biologic effects of 1 negative regulator, USP18, as a means of tuning the T1 IFN response for increased viral fitness. Many studies have focused on the antiviral effects of ISGs, but understanding how host cells regulate antiviral pathways will unveil more complete biologic mechanisms. Many infections or hereditary diseases are not easily modeled in rodents, so new platforms are required to answer key questions about host gene/proteins including negative regulators of signaling. We have demonstrated that iPSCderived cell models, when paired with genome editing technologies, are a powerful tool for studying not only HIV-1 infection, but can also be used to study other infectious disease models, autoimmunity, and other general biologic problems that lack high quality conventional cell line models.

Autocrine/paracrine signaling is a feed forward antiviral mechanism of T1 IFNs where expression of ISGs establishes a nonpermissive environment for viral replication through expression of hundreds of ISGs and their protein products. Here, we find that attenuation of this antiviral mechanism by USP18 in the context of HIV-1 infection has a net beneficial effect for the virus by overriding key antiviral signals. The most proximal events of T1 IFN signaling, phosphorylation of JAK/STAT proteins, are augmented in the absence of USP18, and we conclude that this effect is fundamental to the phenotype of restricted HIV-1 replication in USP18 \u2212/\u2212 cells. Uninfected cells that have received paracrine signals from T1 IFNs will up-regulate ISGs. We demonstrated that USP18 deficient cells have increased expression of IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFITM1, IFITM2, CXCL9, CXCL10, ISG15, and MX2 after treatment with exogenous IFN-. Many of these genes have been previously shown to restrict HIV-1 replication. 66 IFIT family proteins have been shown to restrict HIV-1 by shutting down machinery used by the virus for translation of viral proteins. 67 The IFITM family members have been shown to inhibit HIV-1, by interfering with viral fusion or binding. 68-70 This could potentially result in fewer cells being infected. MX2 is another IFNinducible factor that has been shown to restrict HIV-1 replication. 71,72 The effects of these ISGs may simply be enhanced in the absence of USP18. The roles of CXCL9 and CXCL10 in vivo may help to recruit T cells to interact with infected macrophages. T1 IFN secretion is induced by HIV-1, but at very low levels not detectable by microarray after 7 days of productive HIV-1 infection of macrophages. Clearly, the relatively small amounts of IFN produced early in infection have a meaningful effect on virus replication. When IFNAR blocking antibody was used, HIV-1 infection was reduced rather than enhanced, demonstrating how low levels of IFN can benefit the virus. At the same time, USP18 is not induced by HIV-1 when anti-IFNAR is included, demonstrating that low level T1 IFNs being produced are responsible for USP18 induction as well as the IFN-like transcriptional response. By providing exogenous IFN-, we were able to demonstrate that lack of USP18 makes cells more sensitive to the effects of IFN.F I G U R E 7 USP18 \u2212/\u2212 iMacs have enhanced STAT phosphorylation and enhanced ISG expression.

(B) iMacs were treated with IFN-for 18 h and gene expression of ISGs was measured by RT-qPCR (n = 3). The average RQ of the USP18 \u2212/\u2212 clones divided by the average RQ of the USP18 +/+ clones are expressed as fold change The strategy used by HIV-1 for transcription from its LTR promoter utilizes transcription factors such as NF B, NFAT, and IRFs, 73,74 that would normally be present in a cell that has detected a viral infection and has initiated an antiviral response. By utilizing this transcriptional machinery, HIV-1 has been able to hijack normal immune processes to improve its own fitness, however in vitro experiments have long demonstrated that inflammatory activators like LPS or IFNs can potently restrict HIV-1 replication. Thus, the physiologic state that",

Our iMac model supports very robust HIV-1 replication and shows a similar induction of USP18 in response to infection as what occurs in MDMs. The use of iPSC-derived cells has several advantages over conventional cell models. First, iPSC technologies can be used to derive cells that may not be obtainable in large numbers from living human donors. Second, iPSCs can be grown indefinitely in culture allowing for iterative mechanistic experiments, thus reducing variability. Third, iPSC-derived cells can be genetically modified by use of gene editing technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 and allow for a renewable source of edited cells with knockout and unedited iPSCs derived from the same donor. This complements methods such as siRNA transfection of primary cells such as MDMs.In conclusion, we have shown in a novel iPSC-derived macrophage model that USP18 is required for HIV-1 replication in vitro. We propose that durable and enhanced IFN signaling can restrict HIV-1",
