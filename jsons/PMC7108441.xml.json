According to the World Health Organization, approximately 36.7 million people were living with HIV at the end of 2015 (WHO) (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs360/en/), and HIV remains the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa and was responsible for the death of 1.1 million people throughout the world in 2105 [World Health Organization; Global Health Observatory (GHO) data, The Top 10 Causes of Death; http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/ (accessed March 31, 2017)]. The current predictions suggest that 5753 people will become infected with HIV every day, and this corresponds to approximately 240 people every hour. Macrophages, T cells, and dendritic cells are the preferred destination of HIV. The viral glycoprotein 120 (gp120) binds to the CD4 receptor to initiate a series of conformational changes in gp120 that induce fusion of the virus with the host cell membrane. The viral infection progresses by transformation of the viral RNA genome into a proviral DNA, and the integrated provirus is eventually transcribed by cellular RNA polymerases into a set of mRNAs that generate progeny genomic mRNA and spliced mRNA encoding viral proteins [2].",

In this context, application of microbicides that would efficiently prohibit the initiation transmission of HIV virus is promising tool. As microbicides show significant potential for control and prevention of HIV transmission, they are alternative approach to prevent the heterosexual transmission of HIV [4]. The mechanism of protection against spread of sexually transmitted pathogens included in prohibition of viral replication, creation of physical barriers between HIV virus and cell membrane, boosting defense mechanism of vagina and cervix and etc. [5]. Griffithsin (GRFT) is a lectin HIV entry inhibitor that targets the terminal mannose residues on HIV N-linked glycan as long as the HIV is in contact with GRFT. GRFT was structurally characterized [[6], [7]]. The anti-HIV activity of GRFT derived from red algae has been estimated to have an EC50 value of 40 pM [[8], [9]]. The antiviral activity of GRFT, the fact that it lacks in vitro and in vivo toxicity, and its environmental stability, such as its stability in media with a broad range of pH values and temperatures, even temperatures close to the boiling point, indicate that GRFT is a good anti-HIV microbicide candidate [[10], [11]].",

As a result, plant and bacterial platforms have been used for the expression and accumulation of GRFT [[6], [12]]. The formation of insoluble inclusion bodies (33%), the high manufacturing cost and the presence of bacterial endotoxin have been considered factors that limit the production of GRFT using an E. coli system [13]. Moreover, the production of recombinant GRFT has been reported in Nicotiana benthamiana using a vector based on tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) [3] and transgenic seeds of Oryza sativa [14]. Regardless of these findings, the high cost of in vitro RNA transcription is a marked problem with virus-based system and also the purification of GRFT based on tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) is considered to show some contamination with TMV coat protein and protein degradation [6]. In addition, seed-based expression systems have been shown to exhibit a high degree of versatility regarding the production of recombinant proteins due to protein stability at ambient temperature [15], but the long-term process of seed production and space requirements might be preclusive [16]. In this study, we used a transient expression system based on a non-viral vector to improve the large-scale production of GRFT.",

The most efficient method for the high-level expression of heterologous protein is a transient expression system based on vectors derived from RNA plant virus due to the ability of RNA viruses to replicate to high titers within infected cells. As research and development of plant virus expression vectors progress, the means of introducing them to the host plant has also advanced [18]. However, this method cannot be used for the insertion of foreign genes without affecting replication and compromising the fidelity of the transcripts due to the lack of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases for proofreading and the movement of viral replicons throughout the plant, resulting in biocontamination problems and yielding undesirable features [[19], [20], [21]]. In this context, a recent significant development in the area of agroinfiltration is using \u201cdeconstructed\u201d viral vectors. In this new type of vector, unnecessary viral genome components for the function of plasmid expression are removed, which leads to the assembly of larger transgenes while keeping viral replication and transcription. The MagnICON system represents an efficient and robust gene transferring technology for the transient expression of biopharmaceuticals in plant platforms. Using this system, the need for plasmid delivery based on complicated methods of generating RNA is eliminated. The MagnICON system provides an efficient system without functional infectious proteins because of the deletion of the CP gene, whereas the yield and speed of viral system are maintained [22].",

            "text": "However, restricted protein production based on transient expression system remains a significant drawback in term of economic production. In this context, the gene silencing is major limitation for expression of genes by Agrobacterium-mediated transient system as the foreign nucleic acids recognized and subsequently degraded through mRNA stability process or translational levels [26]. RNA silencing (also known as post-transcriptional gene silencing) is considered an adaptive defense mechanism by eukaryotic organisms whereby foreign transgenes and/or viruses eliminate through highly conserved mechanism. This mechanism starts with formation of the double stranded (ds)RNA and subsequently processing of dsRNA to small (s) 20\u201326-nt dsRNAs with staggered ends and finally terminate with inhibitions of selected sRNA strand within effector complexe RISC (RNA Induced Silencing Complex) acting on partially or fully complementary RNA or DNA [27]. However, this mechanism can be inhibited by gene silencing suppressors derived from viruses. In this case viruses are developed as beneficial tool to counteract gene silencing by viral protein [28]. RNA silencing suppression activity of viral protein of virus stems from its ability to bind siRNA as well as proteins involved in antiviral silencing ([[42], [43]]. The P19 suppressor from the Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) has been widely used to boost transient or constitutive expression level of recombinant proteins in the plant as it selectively inhibits the 21-nt and 22-nt classes of siRNA and also reduce the availability of free siRNA for RISC loading [[58], [61]].",

The ELISA results showed that the maximal expression level was obtained with the combination of three gene-silencing suppressors and demonstrated that the application of Tween-20 at different concentrations without any suppressors did not increase the expression efficiency, suggesting the importance of suppressor application in agroinfiltration (Fig. 2\n).

A cellular analysis revealed that GRFT exerts inhibitory effects against HIV infection at picomolar concentrations (EC50 of \u223c50 pM) [32]. With the aim of assessing the inhibitory activity of GRFT against HIV viral entry, the antiviral activity of GRFT against several glycosylated viruses, such as the murine herpes simplex virus type 2 [46], the Japanese encephalitis virus [47], the hepatitis C virus [48], and the coronavirus responsible for SARS [49], were demonstrated. GRFT shows no toxicity and no immunogenicity, is thermostable under a wide range of conditions, and has a low cost, and these features make GRFT an interesting candidate for the development of antiviral therapies [[3], [11], [50]]. The production and purification of native GRFT from red algae have been reported, but only a low concentration has been obtained [32]. Therefore, the large-scale production of GRFT using a plant platform might open up a new avenue for the commercialization of this protein as a potent HIV inhibitory candidate. A previous study demonstrated the production and purification of GRFT in the cytoplasm of an E. coli system [13]. The production of GRFT into inclusion bodies of E. coli is the main challenge in the development of an E. coli system for the large-scale production of GRFT because the use of various detergents and highly polymerized cycloamylose as a refolding agent or the co-expression of His-GRFT with chaperone components, such as DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE and/or GroEL-GroES, have not yielded sufficiently high recovery of biologically active GRFT [13]. The production of GRFT using N. benthamiana based on a viral vector and the O. sativa endosperm was previously investigated by [3] and [14], respectively. Even so, the purification of GRFT based on a viral vector showed contamination with the TMV coat protein [6], protein purification and protein degradation [14] because the protein produced was decreased from 1 mg/g FW to 0.3 mg/g after purification. Although a seed-based expression system has been shown to exhibit a high degree of versatility for the production of recombinant proteins due to protein stability at ambient temperature [15], potential cross-contamination, the long-term process of seed production, space requirements, unintentional mixing of transgenic and non-transgenic seeds, and public and food industry concerns regarding the production of biopharmaceuticals using food crops might preclude the implementation of this system [[16], [51]].",

This study provides the first demonstration of the expression and production of GRFT using a non-viral-vector-based transient expression system with N. benthamiana and three gene-silencing suppressors. A high level of recombinant GRFT was recovered from transgenic plants seven days after gene delivery. Thus, our transient expression significantly shortened the time for GRFT production compared with the previously reported timeline of 12 days. Additionally, in comparison to that of stable transgenic seeds of O. sativa, our transient expression with agroinfiltration yielded high levels of transgene expression. Therefore, the short timeline and higher production of GRFT obtained with our transient expression system could be considered advantageous for GRFT development and commercialization.",

In addition, transient expression is genome integration-independent strategy, which will not be affected by position effects existing in stable transformation, once that the expression vector remains an episomal DNA molecule [22]. Our result is in accordance with previous works, which indicated that agroinfiltration could efficiently resulted in transferring of Agrobacterium into the plant leaves and robust expression of recombinant proteins [[24], [52], [53], [54]]. In our study, the infiltration of agrobacterium into the intercellular space of the leaf was performed with syringe method (Fig. 2b). Syringe infiltration has demonstrated as favorable tool that provides remarkable advantages such as simple procedure without requiring any specialized equipment, possibility of either infiltrating the whole leaf with one transgene construct or transferring multiple constructs into different areas of one leaf and multiple assessment in one leaf [[53], [55]]. However, syringe infiltration just can be used for production, purification and preclinical functional investigations of recombinant protein in laboratory scale and this method is not affordable in large scale production of recombinant protein. In this context, agroinfiltration with vacuum method was established to produce pharmaceutical protein in terms of scalability, economically and safety.",

For the transient expression of recombinant protein by agroinfiltration, bacterial suspension could be infiltrated into fresh tissue via vacuum or syringe infiltration, which allows the production of different biopharmaceutical proteins in a large scale and within a short time. However, the expression of recombinant protein could be notably decreased by post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in the plant host. In this work, we studied the addition of three gene-silencing viral suppressor proteins (P19, P0 and P1) combined with the syringe co-agroinfiltration method for high GRFT protein expression. We also assayed the effect of syringe co-agroinfiltration method with Tween-20 at concentrations of 0.015% and 0.03% and without any suppressor application on expression efficiency. The results illustrated herein demonstrated that leaves co-agroinfiltrated with the three gene-silencing suppressors exhibited the highest level of GRFT at 7 d.p.i. compared with the application of P19, P1 and P0 individually as well as in the absence of suppressors. Our results suggest that suppressing the post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism with three gene silencing suppressors in N. benthamiana increased the number of GRFT gene transcripts and subsequently elevated the transient expression of recombinant GRFT.",

            "text": "RNA silencing is critical process involved in decreasing of foreign genes expression in plant system. In this context, using of plant virus encoding suppressors of RNA silencing is considered as an applicable strategy to counteract RNA silencing mechanism and subsequently boost protein expression content in plants [[37], [56], [57]]. Use of RNA silencing suppressors has been widely reported for increasing of recombinant proteins content in plant. In this context P19 from TBSV involved in siRNA sequestration has been gained more attention. The P19 protein is a strong silencing suppressor protein and can selectively inhibits the 21-nt and 22-nt classes of siRNA [58]. The P1 protein from Rice Yellow Mottle Virus has own mechanism to inhibit the accumulation of the 22-nt and 24-nt siRNA [59]. P0 protein is a silencing suppressor which inhibits local and systemic RNA silencing through AGO1 degradation [60]. Our result is similar to that of Lacombe et al. [61], who recently showed the effect of the combination of P19, P1 and P0 to enhance expression levels of anti-leishmaniasis vaccine candidate by transient expression system in N. benthamiana. The synergetic effect of P0 and P1 on RNA silencing suppression was shown in combination with P19. It is hypothesized that the P1suppressor could affect system RNA silencing suppression via inhibition of 24 nts siRNA production. As 24 nts siRNA might induce the formation of systemic RNA silencing signal and the combination of the P1 suppressor with P19 and P0 would strongly affect the RNA gene silencing, and consequently increase recombinant protein production in plant not only locally but also on systemic level through viral based tool [61]. Based on our data, we can speculate that combination of P19, P0, and P1 suppressors could be efficiently applied to boost expression level of other recombinant protein by transient expression in N. benthamiana. However, the use of the three P19, P0, and P1 gene suppressors together might not be recommended for stable transgenic plants since the combination of gene silencing suppressors could trigger harmful developmental damage on plant cell [[61], [62]].",

            "text": "Purification of the His-tagged GRFT was performed by one-step purification through affinity chromatography. The purification of GRFT was performed under native conditions and without ammonium sulphate precipitation. We first obtained a calculated yield of 238 \u03bcg/g FW, which represent a recovery of 59.5%. The number and nature of a purification step are considered significant factors affecting the viability of recombinant proteins produced in plants [14]. The GRFT produced based on a viral vector in N. benthamiana decreased from 1 mg/g to 300 \u03bcg/g after purification, representing 30% recovery. The presence of the TMV vector coat protein required further purification to remove the coat protein, resulting in a low recovery of GRFT [3]. Vamvaka et al. [14] demonstrated that protein extraction using a phosphate buffer combined with IMAC achieved 74% recovery of GRFT expressed in the rice endosperm based on a stable expression system, and this value is slightly higher than the recovery obtained using our system. To study the effect of the salt concentration on GRFT recovery, we added different concentrations of NaCl to the extraction buffer, and the results clearly illustrated that the yield of GRFT was significantly increased by the addition of salt at a concentration of 450 mM. After salt treatment, the yield of GRFT increased from 238 \u03bcg/g to 287 \u03bcg/g, representing a recovery of 71.75%. This result is in agreement with Mayani et al. [64], who showed that the addition of salt at a concentration of 450 mM to the extraction buffer can improve the recovery of recombinant protein in N. benthamiana. The protein extraction process is as essential step of the recovery process because it tailors the total extract volume, concentrations and purity of the recombinant protein as well as the isolation of the desired protein from impurities or/and contaminations that should be removed during the purification process [[65], [66]]. Our data demonstrate that protein recovery increases after salt treatment due to the combination of a reduction in electrostatic interactions between the recombinant protein and plant protein components, such as cellulose that carry a negative charge, and/or increases in osmotic pressure in the extraction buffer, which would result in the dehydration of tissue components [64]. However, increasing the salt concentration in the extraction buffer to a concentration above 450 mM decreased the GRFT yield. It is possible that the solubility of GRFT was reduced at a high salt concentration, which would subsequently increase the hydrophobic interactions with plant tissue components, and this mechanism can feasibly occur in the presence of a higher concentration of salt. Our results demonstrate that optimization of the early steps in the recovery and purification processes are crucial for obtaining viable plant-based recombinant protein production. We used a non-viral-vector-based transient expression system to eliminate the step for purifying the expressed GRFT. The expression of GRFT in the non-viral vector was prepared under non-denaturing conditions to maintain the native form of GRFT and thus avoid an additional refolding step. The GRFT protein expressed by our system was obtained at a yield of 287 \u03bcg/g FW, which is higher than that obtained in transgenic seed rice (223 \u03bcg/g dry seed weight). Our transient expression system significantly shortened the timeline of GRFT production compared with the previously reported timeline of 12 days. Therefore, the short timeline and the higher production of GRFT obtained with our transient expression could be considered advantageous toward GRFT development and commercialization.",

            "text": "GRFT is a potent HIV inhibitor candidate that tightly binds to high mannose-saccharides on the surface of the glycoproteins gp120, gp41 and gp160 and efficiently inhibits virus infection [[45], [48]]. GRFT has been shown to bind the HIV glycoprotein by blocking CD4 binding as well as by binding other anti-HIV antibodies [67]. GRFT has a smaller recognition epitope and lower binding stoichiometry compared to other HIV lectin. The suitable content of GRFT for binding to a single gp120 glycoprotein has been reported approximately to equal 10 GRFT units [49]. In this study, we therefore analysed the biological activity NT-GRFT- 450 mM NaCl protein exhibits a comparable EC50 value of 0.9 nM to tobacco-produced GRFT transduced with a viral vector (TMV-GRFTEC50 1.3 nM). Our analysis showed that the ability of GRFT expressed in N. benthamiana to bind to gp120 was close to that of the protein purified from E. coli. Similarly, O\u2019Keefe et al. and Vamvaka et al. [[3], [14]] showed that the binding characteristics of plant-based GRFT exhibited similar or even better gp120-binding activity than GRFT expressed in E. coli.\n",

We found that GRFT produced in E. coli presented whole-cell HIV cytopathicity with an EC50 value of 0.089 nM as well as EC50 values of 0.054 nM for native GRFT. Additionally, O\u2019Keefe et al. [3] reported an EC50 value of 0.156 nM for GRFT. But in our experiments, we report the anti-HIV activity of TMV-GRFT at an EC50 value of 1.3 nM. In this case, the discrepancy in EC50 values is the result of reformatting the whole-cell neutralization assay from a 96-well to a 384-well higher throughput format, as described in the material and methods section. Recently, an EC50 value of 0.27 was obtained for GRFT expressed in the rice endosperm. The differences among the EC50 values obtained in these studies reflect the variability of the syncytium inhibition assay, which is used as a comparison tool in an experiment. In vivo safety and efficacy are two critical issues related to potential anti-HIV microbicide activity. The HIV neutralization activity observed in this study confirmed that GRFT is correctly folded in plants and maintains its biological activity.",
