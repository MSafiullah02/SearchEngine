This S protein facilitates receptor binding and membrane fusion and it is important for inducing the host tropism and at the same time the transmission power (3). Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) is actually known as cell receptor for SARS-CoV2 (4). Analogous to the known SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 utilize ACE2 as the entry point in the ACE2-expressing cells, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 share the similar life cycle with other SARS-CoV (4). It is important to highlight that S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 with around from 10- to 20-fold greater attraction than S protein of SARS-CoV (5). This high affinity of S protein for human ACE2 probably has facilitate the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in human populations. Increasingly, evidence shows continued human-to-human transmission, along with many disseminated cases across the entire globe (6).",

The presence of multiple pre-existing comorbidities is related with more severe COVID-19 infection manifestation, reflecting the presence of pre-existent physical and/or cognitive frailty. It is now evident that the COVID-19 disease vulnerable and dying population encompasses the older persons and people with underlying medical conditions (such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, respiratory diseases), which needs more attention and care (8,9). Recent evidences demonstrate that in Italy there is the highest proportion of older patients with COVID-19 disease and that the rate of older people may partially clarify the differences in the number of cases and in the case-fatality rates observed among countries. Overall, deaths for COVID-19 infection are largely detected among older, male patients who at the same time have multiple comorbidities.",

In second stage, diffuse and bilateral ground glass opacities and consolidation are evident in more than two lobes.

Thus, long-term care facilities need to have special precautions and protocols to defend residents, employees, and visitors. In this respect the role of geriatricians is crucial for the prompt identification, isolation and care of suspected and confirmed patients affected by COVID-19 disease. This early identification is essential to limit as much as possible the spread of infection among residents in the longterm care facilities.
