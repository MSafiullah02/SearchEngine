We characterized the persistently infected cells by detecting virus particles, protein and transcripts. Basal levels of type I interferon in the long-term infected bat cells were higher, relative to uninfected cells, and disrupting the interferon response in persistently infected bat cells increased virus replication. By sequencing the whole genome of MERS-CoV from persistently infected bat cells, we identified that bat cells repeatedly selected for viral variants that contained mutations in the viral open reading frame 5 (ORF5) protein. Furthermore, bat cells that were persistently infected with \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV were resistant to superinfection by wildtype virus, likely due to reduced levels of the virus receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and higher basal levels of interferon in these cells. In summary, our study provides evidence for a model of coronavirus persistence in bats, along with the establishment of a unique persistently infected cell culture model to study MeRS-coV-bat interactions.",

Bats are speculated to be reservoirs of several emerging viruses, including coronaviruses (CoVs) that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in humans, and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) and swine acute diarrhoea syndrome (SADS) in pigs 3-6 . Although bats harbor SARS-and MERS-like coronaviruses, overt signs of disease in bats that are naturally or experimentally infected are often undetectable 7 .

Little is known about long-term molecular processes that govern the relationship of the virus with its ancestral bat host. A recent study showed that bat CoVs can persist in their natural bat host for at least four months of hibernation 25 . The authors observed that persistent infection is disrupted by immunologically stressful events, such as a secondary fungal infection with the white-nose syndrome causing fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans leading to an increase in virus replication 26 . Persistence of viruses in bats and increase in virus shedding during 'stressful' events has also been observed with Henipavirus infections 27,28 .",

In this study, we have identified coronavirus and host factors that enable a long-term persistent infection in cultured bat cells. We show for the first time that cells from an insectivorous bat, Eptesicus fuscus, can be persistently infected with MERS-CoV over a period of several months. Disrupting interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-mediated antiviral signaling pathways and inhibiting MAP kinase pathways in these cells lead to an increase in virus replication. In addition, the establishment of persistent infection in bat cells in two separate experiments consistently identified inactivating mutations in the viral ORF5 gene.

Scrambled non-specific DsiRNA (NC DsiRNA; IDT) was used as a negative control. For MAP kinase inhibition, URMC-099 drug that was resuspended in DMSO (Cayman chemicals, Cat #1229582-33-5) was used at a concentration of 1 \u00b5M 63 . DMSO only was used as a negative control. Cells were harvested after 24 and 48 hours and virus replication was quantified using MERS-CoV UpE primers and qPCR. next generation sequencing. For Sanger sequencing of ORF5, RNA was extracted from MERS-CoV persistently-infected Efk cultures using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers. MERS-CoV genome was amplified in 1.5-2.5 kB overlapping fragments using iProof High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). PCR products were purified with a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and used as input for the Illumina Nextera DNA Flex Library Prep Kit (Illumina, Inc.). Libraries were sequenced with 150 bp paired-end reads on Illumina MiSeq. Reads were mapped to the reference genome using BWA-MEM 64 . cloning. Conventional PCR was carried out to amplify full-length MERS-CoV ORF 5 with restriction sites KpnI and BamHI using cDNA prepared from RNA that was extracted from Efk cells infected with MERS-CoV. Red fluorescent protein (RFP) with restriction sites BamHI and XhoI was amplified from pcDNA3-mRFP using mRFP primers. PCR was performed using the following thermal cycle profile: initial denaturation for 3 min at 94 \u00b0C, 35 PCR cycles at 94 \u00b0C/30 s, 56 \u00b0C/30 s and 72 \u00b0C/1 min. The final extension was at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The two PCR products were ligated into a pcDNA3 backbone that was digested with KpnI and XhoI. Plasmid resulting from the double ligation was used to transform DH5\u03b1 E. coli cells. Bacterial cells were plated on 2YT plates with ampicillin. Resistant bacterial colonies were scanned for plasmids carrying the ORF5-RFP insert. Positive clones were amplified in broth culture. Plasmids were later purified and concentrated using a MaxiPrep kit (QIAGEN, Cat #12163). The endoplasmic reticulum marker, Luman-GFP was made in a previous study (53-55).

Expression of MERS-CoV gene segments S, E, M, N, ORFs 3, 4a, 4b and 5 increased over time in acutely infected cells (Fig. 2b-i) . This was concomitant with an increase in MERS-CoV genome quantities (Fig. 2a) in acutely infected cells, as represented by upE levels 33 . In contrast, persistently infected bat cells maintained steady levels of genome (upE) quantities and with the exception of ORF5, other viral genes maintained detectable but stable levels of expression ( Fig. 2a-i) . We were unable to detect transcripts for ORF5 in persistently infected bat cells (Fig. 2f ).",

To determine if persistently infected bat cells had selected for mutant variants of MERS-CoV, we sequenced the genome of the virus from persistently infected bat cells that had been passaged 15 times, over 4 months. We detected point mutations in the virus polymerase, spike and matrix genes ( Fig. 3a) but none of these mutations disrupted the coding sequences for these proteins (Table 1) . However, we observed a 341 base pair deletion in ORF5. In addition, there was a frameshift mutation at the N-terminal end of the protein that introduced a stop codon at the 20 th amino acid position ( Fig. 3a and Table 1 ). In theory, the intact ORF5 coding sequence in the bat-adapted MERS-CoV strain would encode a putative 19 amino acid long protein. To identify when the ORF5 deletion mutant (\u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV) was selected for during the establishment of persistently infected bat cells, we sequenced ORF5 from early and late passage cells. As early as passage two, the detectable virus population in culture comprised of the ORF5 mutant. In the following portion of this article, we refer to the original human-derived virus as the MERS-CoV wildtype virus (W+) and the ORF5 deleted variant as ORF5 mutant (\u0394ORF5) MERS-CoV.",

We detected a point mutation in ORF5 as early as passage 2, which resulted in a stop codon in the coding sequence for ORF5.

            "text": "A recent study demonstrated that in contrast to its ability to suppress innate antiviral responses in human cells, MERS-CoV induces a robust type I interferon response in bat cells 31 . Since \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV replicated better in bat cells than W + MERS-CoV, we examined the differences in their ability to induce innate antiviral responses. We compared the levels of transcripts for interferon beta (IFN\u03b2) and selected downstream IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), such as guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP1), myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1), interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and interferon inducible protein 6 (IFI6) in human and bat cells infected with a high MOI of W+ or \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV for 24 hours. IFN\u03b2 transcript levels in \u0394ORF5 infected bat cells were higher than W + MERS-CoV infected human cells at 24 hpi (Fig. 4a) . Bat cells infected with \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV contained significantly (p \u2264 0.05) higher levels of transcripts for IFI6 and MDA5 (Fig. 4b ,e) than cells infected with W + virus. IFI6 transcript levels in bat cells infected with W + MERS-CoV were also significantly higher than W + MERS-CoV infected human cells (Fig. 4b) . For other genes that were examined, there was an increasing trend for gene expression in bat cells infected with \u0394ORF5, but the differences were not statistically significant during the duration of this experiment (p = 0.08-0.11; Fig. 4c persistently infected bat cells are resistant to superinfection with W + MeRS-coV. Viruses often exist as quasispecies, including virus stocks that are prepared in laboratories 34 . Coronaviruses have been detected in multiple bat species globally 35 and wild-caught bats can be persistently infected with coronaviruses 18, 25 . The co-evolution of CoVs and bats, and the advantage of long-term CoV infection, if any, have not been explored in bats. In this study, we observed \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV as the dominant strain in persistently infected bat cells in two independent experiments. To identify if infection with \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV confers a survival advantage upon bat cells, we determined if persistently infected bat cells were resistant to superinfection with W + virus. To differentiate between W+ and \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV replication, we examined the levels of genomic (upE) RNA (present in both strains), and ORF5 transcripts, (detectable in W + MERS-CoV only). On re-infecting www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ persistently infected bat cells with W + virus (MOI = 1 TCID 50 /cell), we did not observe an increase in upE or ORF5 RNA levels in the superinfected cells, suggesting a lack of replication of W+ and \u0394ORF5 virus at 24 and 48 hpi (Fig. 5a,b) . In contrast, we observed a significant increase in upE and ORF5 transcript levels at 24-and 48-hours post infection of na\u00efve bat cells that were infected with an equal amount of W + MERS-CoV (Fig. 5a,b) . Immediately following infection, ORF5 transcripts in superinfected bat cells (\u0394ORF5 + W + MERS-CoV) were significantly higher than in persistently infected bat cells (Fig. 5b) , but the expression levels did not increase over time, suggesting that W + virus did not replicate and that the initial difference was due to input virus. MERS-CoV uses DPP4 as a receptor for cellular entry and both MRC5 and Efk cells contained comparable amounts of DPP4 transcripts (Fig. 5c -right panel) . To determine if the persistently-infected cells were resistant to infection by W + MERS-CoV because of reduced DPP4 expression, we measured relative amounts of DPP4 transcripts in the samples described in Fig. 5a ,b. Efk cells infected with W + MERS-CoV contained high levels of DPP4 transcripts, which did not decrease significantly in the 48 hrs following infection (Fig. 5c ). While we could amplify DPP4 transcripts in all cells (see gel insert in Fig. 5c ), in contrast to na\u00efve Efk cells infected with W + MERS-CoV, the persistently infected cells contained almost 100 fold (average \u2212 \u0394\u0394CT values of 6.1) less DPP4 transcripts. These levels did not change significantly in the 48 hrs following infection with W + MERS-CoV.",

Reducing IRF3 protein levels in persistently infected bat cells also increased cell death within 48 hours of siRNA treatment compared to control siRNA-treated persistently infected cells (data not shown).",

Here we demonstrate that unlike in human cells, where infection leads to death of all cells, MERS-CoV establishes a persistent infection in a bat cell line. We observed that: a) Infection of bat cells led to a long-term persistent infection. b) The viability of the cells in culture did not depend on the presence of uninfected resistant cells, as seen in some models of coronavirus persistence 43 . All bat cells in culture contained viral RNA and protein. c) Viral persistence www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ was accompanied by the rapid selection of mutations in the accessory gene -ORF5, and this mutation was \"fixed\" for at least 15 passages of the culture over 4 months. While viral persistence was accompanied by mutations in other genes, none of the mutations appeared to be as drastic as the ORF5 mutations. The genomic locations of other mutations in MERS-CoV also varied between the two independent attempts at establishing persistence. d) The \u0394ORF5 mutant virus replicated more efficiently in bat cells than W + MERS-CoV, and cells infected at high MOIs by the \u0394ORF5 mutant contained higher levels of some interferon-stimulated and anti-apoptotic transcripts. e) Cells persistently infected with the \u0394ORF5 mutant were resistant to infection by W + MERS-CoV. Compared to uninfected or W + MERS-CoV-infected Efk cells, cells persistently-infected with \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV expressed greatly reduced levels of DPP4 transcripts, the known receptor for W + MERS-CoV. f) Persistence was maintained by the retention of higher basal levels of cellular interferon response, as suppression of the response by down-regulating IRF3 increased virus replication.",

Due to the error-prone nature of the viral RNA polymerase, the laboratory stock likely contains variants that are less successful for replication in primate cells than the W + virus. These mutants include some with alterations in the ORF5 gene that render the virus less cytolytic for bat cells. Infection of bat cells at a low MOI leads to the infection of cells by either the W+ or \u0394ORF5 mutant virus. Due to the cytolytic nature of the W + virus, cells infected by it die with the subsequent release of more W + virus. While cells infected by the less cytolytic \u0394ORF5 mutants also produce virus, they survive. \u0394ORF5 mutant virus infected cells survive because the virus induces a more robust innate antiviral response in these cells and the apoptotic processes that accompany W + virus infection are dampened (see IFI6 expression; Fig. 4b ).",

The mechanisms by which infected cells are rendered resistant to further infection vary, but often rely on the occlusion of receptors for the superinfecting virus. We found that the levels of DPP4 transcripts in infected cells did not decrease following infection of Efk cells with either W + or \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV (Figs. 4f and 5c ). This suggests that during a normal infection at a high MOI, MERS-CoV does not down-regulate the expression of the receptor. However, a lack of bat specific immunological reagents prevented us from detecting bat DPP4 on the surface of MERS-CoV infected Efk cells, so we cannot rule out a decrease in the expression of the protein on the cell surface or occlusion by the viral spike protein.",

Our model also allows us to develop hypotheses that can then be tested by observations in a wild free-living species. Virus titration. Supernatant from persistently infected bat cells were titrated in triplicates on Vero 76 cells using tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) assay. Briefly, 10 4 cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate. The plates were incubated overnight to obtain a confluent layer of Vero 76 cells. The virus sample (supernatant) was diluted ten-fold and 50\u03bcl of the diluted virus sample was added to each well of the 96-well plate. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hr.

Next day, cells were harvested in sample buffer for western blots. Western blots were carried out as previously mentioned 60 . Briefly, samples were denatured in a reducing sample buffer and electrophoresed on a reducing gel. Proteins were blotted from the gel onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, GE Healthcare, Cat #10600023) membranes and detected using primary and secondary antibodies. Primary antibodies used were: 1: 1,000 rabbit anti-IRF3 (Abcam; Cat# ab68481), 1: 1,000 mouse anti-GAPDH (EMD Milipore, Cat #AB2302) and 1: 1,000 rabbit anti-MERS-CoV N protein (Sino Biological, Cat #40068-RP01).

Persistently infected Efk cells were scraped in phosphate buffered saline and pooled in a 15 ml screw-cap centrifuge tube. The cells were recovered by centrifugation at 300xg for 5 mins and the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10% neutral buffered formalin (10% NBF; Sigma, Cat #HT501128) for virus inactivation. The cells were later processed for electron microscopy as mentioned previously 25 . Briefly, cells were treated with osmium tetroxide (1% OsO 4 , 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer) for one hour at room temperature. Samples were quickly rinsed with water, gradually dehydrated in ethanol and en-bloc stained with uranyl acetate. After rinsing three times (5 min each) in propylene oxide, samples were infiltrated with Epon/Araldite (electron Microscopy Sciences, Cat #50-980-381). Samples were placed in molds and freshly prepared Epon/Araldite was added. The samples were then polymerized at 60 \u00b0C for 24-48 h. Sections of 90 nm were cut and observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM -Hitachi HT 7700, Tokyo, Japan).",

            "text": "Proposed model for establishment of persistent MERS-CoV infection in bat cells. As with the stocks of most RNA viruses, the MERS-CoV inoculum is made up of the dominant W + virus as well as smaller numbers of variants, including variants with inactivating mutations in ORF5 (\u0394ORF5). The cells infected with the more cytolytic W + virus die, while the small number of cells infected with \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV survive because of an ensuing antiviral response and the induction of anti-apoptotic processes. \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV infected cells are resistant to infection with the W + virus and the W + virus is soon diluted out. After a process of cell death and recovery, \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV infected cells survive and take over, leading to a culture of persistently infected cells that produce small, but consistent amounts of virus over time.

Cat #MT10017CV) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma, Cat #F0392), penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Cat #15140122) and GlutaMax (Gibco, Cat #35050061). Persistently infected Efk cells were maintained and passaged in the same media as Efk cells. Vero 76 (green monkey kidney; ATCC, Cat #CRL-1587) cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. Human lung (MRC5) cells (ATCC CCL-171) were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM; Corning) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1/100 non-essential amino acids (NEAA; Gibco), 1/100 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES; Gibco) and 1/1000 gentamycin (Gibco). Cells were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 .Virus infection. All work with infectious MERS-CoV was performed in containment level 3 at VIDO-InterVac and was approved by the institutional biosafety committee. Sample inactivation was performed according to standard operating procedures approved by the institutional biosafety committee. MERS-CoV (isolate EMC/2012 57 ) was propagated in Vero 76 cells in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin (Gibco, Cat #15140122). In the text, low multiplicity of infection (MOI) refers to an infectious dose of 0.01 TCID 50 /cell and high MOI refers to an infectious dose of 10 TCID 50 / cell.For establishing persistent infection, Efk cells were seeded at a concentration of 3 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well in one well of a six well plate. The cells were infected with MERS-CoV (strain EMC/2012) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Growth medium on the cells was replaced regularly and surviving cells were split using 0.25% trypsin (Sigma, Cat #20233). Supernatant from each passage was saved at \u221280 \u00b0C for virus titration. For acute infection, Efk cells were seeded at a concentration of 3 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well in a six well plate. The cells were infected with MERS-CoV (strain EMC/2012) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 TCID 50 /ml. \u0394ORF5 MERS-CoV was rescued by passaging the virus collected from the supernatant of persistently infected Efk cells on Vero 76 cells. The deletion in ORF5 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequencing.",
