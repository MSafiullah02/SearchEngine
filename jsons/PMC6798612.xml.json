In a similar study carried out by R\u00fageles et al16, E. coli was isolated from 58 per cent of the meat samples. Badri et al18 reported the prevalence of E. coli in meat samples as 48 per cent. Several other studies have reported the presence of E. coli in raw milk and meat products12192021. It should be noted that in the studied dairy samples, no E. coli isolate was identified in Doogh and yoghurt samples. It could be due to acidic pH and high temperatures created during their fermentation process22. Moreover, majority of E. coli identified in meat products were isolated from ground meat and hamburger. It is probable, these products are more contaminated due to poor sanitation of grinder and high manipulation in their production process23. According to the results of the duplex-PCR of isolated E. coli, only two EPEC were found in raw milk and raw milk products, whereas two ETEC and four EPEC were identified in raw meat products. In similar studies518, no case of ETEC was found in raw meat products, while EPEC (mostly atypical) was the most isolated pathotype, thereby confirming the results of the present study. Mohammed11 showed that 15.63 per cent E. coli isolated from meat products were ETEC, which was higher than that of several previous studies. Holko et al24, reported 2.1 per cent ETEC and 3.09 per cent EPEC in traditional cheese samples made from sheep milk. A study conducted on raw milk materials, found one ETEC and 13 EPEC5. In another study on 206 samples of raw milk, 17 EPEC (8.25%) were identified.",
