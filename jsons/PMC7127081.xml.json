Antibody is a critical component of colostrum and provides an immediate source of antibody for agammaglobulinemic calves. Calves that ingest colostrum shortly after birth have significant concentrations of immunoglobulin in serum, whereas colostrum-deprived calves have only trace amounts of immunoglobulin during the first 3 days of life [11]. Endogenous production of IgM in colostrum-deprived calves does not begin to appear in the circulation until 4 days after birth and does not reach functional levels (1 mg/mL) until 8 days of age. Levels of circulating IgA, IgG1, and IgG2 do not reach appreciable levels in these calves until 16 to 32 days after birth [12]. The levels of these antibodies do not approach adult levels until approximately 4 months after birth; at that time IgG2 is only half of adult levels, which indicates a strong T-helper 2 cell (TH2) bias [12].",

It is not clear if these cytokines are secreted in the mammary gland, produced by the leukocytes found in colostrum or both. Interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-beta, and interferon-gamma are present in bovine colostrum and are associated with a proinflammatory response and may help in the recruitment of neonatal lymphocytes into the gut to aid in normal immune development. Colostrum rapidly improves the ability of neutrophils to phagocytize bacteria, which is primarily accomplished by absorption of small molecules such as cytokines [14]. Work in pigs has demonstrated that colostral cytokines are absorbed and can be detected in the blood [15]. The level of these cytokines (IL-4>IL-6>interferon-gamma>IL-10) peaked at 1 to 2 days postpartum. The high levels of two anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-4 and transforming growth factor beta-1, suppress local secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in the intestine and allow gut microbial colonization.",

These viable leukocytes are present in percentages similar to peripheral blood, but with a larger fraction of macrophages (40%\u201350%) and a smaller fraction of lymphocytes (22%\u201325%) and neutrophils (25%\u201337%) [17], [18]. Most lymphocytes are T lymphocytes, with less than 5% being B lymphocytes. Some of these maternal cells enter the circulation and reach peak levels 24 hours after birth [19]. Animals that receive colostrum that contains maternal leukocytes develop antigen-presenting cells faster [18]. This is important because antigen-presenting cells are the keystone cell for development of an acquired immune response to pathogens or vaccines. Pathogen-specific maternal T lymphocytes from vaccinated cows have been isolated from neonatal calves with maximum inducible proliferation at 1 day after birth [20]. The exact role of these cells in the long-term development of pathogen-specific acquired immunity is not clear because they are no longer detectable in the circulation at 7 days of age.",

Complement activity in newborn calves at birth is approximately 50% of that in adult cows. The circulating complement is quickly diminished to less than 20% of the level circulating in adult cows at 1 day of age. The levels of complement in circulation gradually increase and by 1 month of age have risen to approximately 50% of the level in adults [28]. Interferon activity in the epithelial cells of neonates appears normal, but the production of type 1 interferon by leukocytes is lower [28]. The cellular components of innate immunity are also affected: the number of neutrophils circulating in the newborn calf is approximately four times higher than in 3-week-old calves. Neonatal neutrophils and macrophages have reduced phagocytic ability, but their capacity is increased after the ingestion of colostrum [14]. By 1 week of age, neutrophils are functional and able to mount an effective response [4]. Neutrophil function gradually improves to adult levels by 5 months of age [29]. The number of dendritic cells is lower in neonates, and their ability to present antigen to activate the acquired immune system is limited [25]. Monocytes migrate to the tissues and develop into dendritic cells after proinflammatory stimulation. The number of circulating natural killer cells is also lower at 1 week of age (3% of total lymphocytes) than in adults. The fraction of circulating natural killer cells increases to 10% by 6 to 8 weeks of age [4].",

            "text": "Certainly one of the major challenges in developing an active immune response in young calves has been interference from maternal immunity (see Fig. 1) [25]. This problem has been demonstrated with several pathogens, including rotavirus [31], BVDV [32], bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) [33], [34], bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) [35], and Mannheimia (Pasturella) haemolytica\n[36]. The timing of many vaccines administrated by the parenteral route involves estimating when the level of maternal antibody is low enough for an active immune response to progress sufficiently to provide vaccine immunity (see Fig. 1). Most maternal antibody has a decay half-life of 16 to 28 days [37]. The prime window for vaccination can be anywhere from a few weeks to 8 months. As illustrated in Fig. 1, this period can vary by animal and depends on the level of maternal antibody and the vaccine antigen, which presents a major challenge for vaccine development. Antibody levels often decay to a level still high enough to block responses to vaccine but not high enough to resist a field infection, which creates a window of opportunity for infecting organisms.",

Parenteral vaccination with either inactivated or MLV at 7 weeks of age in the presence of maternal antibodies resulted in a cellular response for the MLV group with no increase in antibody titers for either vaccine. Revaccination with either vaccine 4.5 months later resulted in an anamnestic response in antibody titers [39], which indicated the importance of timing. For bacterins, the period of maternal antibody interference is usually shorter; for example, 40% of colostrum-fed calves vaccinated with M haemolytica seroconvert at 2 and 4 weeks of age [36].",

One of the most successful strategies against maternal antibody interference is the use of intranasal (IN) vaccines for BHV-1 [41], [42], BRSV [36], [43], and PI3 [41], [42], [44] in young calves. Additional experimental studies with IN BVDV in 2- to 5-week-old calves also provided protection against BVDV challenge [39], [45]. An experimental IN live Pasturella multicida vaccine also has been developed and has been shown to induce high levels of secretory antibody [42]. IN vaccines have the advantage of being able to replicate in the nasal mucosa and prime the mucosal immune system with little interference from secretory antibodies. The mucosal immunity primed by IN vaccines is also more likely to prevent infection rather than just reduce disease. Low or no systemic antibody titers often are detected after IN vaccination, which makes it difficult to assess immunity using serology [43]. Despite the lack of \u201cseroconversion,\u201d IN vaccines have generated protective immunity that lasts for months [34], [41], [45]. An additional advantage of IN vaccines is their ability to induce interferon to induce the antiviral state within 40 hours after administration. Induction of interferon in young calves also may aid in the development of a mature immune system.",

These calves demonstrated strong antigen-specific interferon-gamma and IL-2 responses to M bovis purified protein derivative. Upon challenge with virulent M bovis at 14 to 17 weeks of age, 100% of calves vaccinated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin were protected from development of tuberculous lesions, whereas all (10/10) unvaccinated controls developed lesions. It was noted in these experiments that none of the calves developed significant levels of M bovis\u2013specific antibody [51]. One-week-old calves vaccinated with bacillus Calmette-Guerin also generated significant cell mediated immunity but failed to produce significant antibody responses; conversely, young adults effectively produced cell-mediated immune responses and serum antibody titers [52]. The take-home message is that cell-mediated responses to vaccines can be induced early; however, animals may need to be as old as 3 to 4 weeks before vaccines induce corresponding antibody responses that develop 10 to 14 days after vaccination.",

            "text": "Many vaccine protocols have been developed to vaccinate young calves at frequencies as often as weekly during the first and second months of age. Finding any experimental studies that support this frequency is difficult. From other immune systems, it is clear that too frequent vaccination in young animals can lead to antigen-specific tolerance (ie, the lack of any immune response to the antigen) [53], which is the result of suppressive T cells and the deletion of T and B clones specific for those antigens. Another possible adverse outcome of overvaccination is autoimmunity, whose development is based on priming against the animal's own antigens (self) or closely mimicking vaccine antigens to the animal's own antigens. An example of this mimicry is antibodies against one of the surface proteins of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) cross-reacting with a surface protein of the immune cells [54]. Stimulation of inflammatory mechanisms associated with vaccination (eg, adjuvants such as alum or microbial ligands) or repeated re-exposure to vaccine components that drive expansion of autoimmune B- and T-cell clones may occur with frequently repeated vaccine stimulation [55], [56]. In all animals after vaccination there is expansion in the populations of responding T- and B-cell clones (\nFig. 3). Requirements for good immune response are that this clonal expansion stops and that an active process of cell death (apoptosis) occurs (see Fig. 3). This \u201cwaning process\u201d allows \u201cculling\u201d of T or B cells that may be poor responders or even cause autoimmunity to be removed by apoptosis [57]. This whole process from vaccination to achieving homeostasis takes at least 3 weeks for the development of a primary response, which can then be boosted to get a true anamnestic secondary response.",

A promising development has been an IN BRSV vaccine that has been licensed in Europe [34] IN vaccination takes advantage of the poor penetration of antibody from colostrum onto mucosal surfaces providing less interference with the function of vaccines. This vaccine reduced clinical disease in 3-week-old colostrum-fed calves challenged 66 days after vaccination. Another study administered a commercial four-way viral MLV vaccine licensed for parenteral use, intranasally, in 2-week-old colostrum-fed calves and found it to be protective 8 days after vaccination [43]. A single dose of inactivated four-way viral vaccine in 4- to 5-week-old calves protected them against a BRSV challenge 3 weeks after vaccination [46].",

Studies conducted on calf ranches have indicated that there is little advantage gained from vaccinating calves younger than 60 days of age [60] and that maternal antibody protection lasts from 70 to 110 days [61]. The greatest risk for BVDV infection was from 4 to 9 months of age as animals were group housed in larger groups [62]. Vaccination programs that vaccinated calves in the first 60 days and then much later at 4 to 9 months were not effective in preventing infection [62]. Based on this information, BVDV control programs that use MLV probably should begin around 2 to 3 months of age and be followed by revaccination after 3 to 4 weeks.",

Maternal interference is less likely at mucosal sites in young animals, so most of them develop active immunity [41], [58]. After IN vaccination, high levels of mucosal and serum interferon are also produced [63] that direct an antiviral effect and may aid in the development of the neonatal immune response. BHV-1 is also immunosuppressive [64]. Because of their localized and limited replication in the nasal epithelium, however, IN BHV-1 vaccines are less of a danger for development of immunosuppression than parenteral vaccines. All BHV-1 vaccines, including IN vaccines [35], can result in latency, which is the ability of the virus to reactivate (recrudesce) and be shed. The biologic relevance of this reactivation and shedding of BHV-1 is unclear because there are no lesions or disease syndromes associated with recrudescence, and the virus can only be reactivated experimentally after several days of treatment with high doses of dexamethasone [35].",

The first necessity of planning a calf vaccine program is to assess the disease risks at the production site. One must carefully review the antigens that are being used to make sure that they make sense for the operation. The affect of maternal immunity and the age of the animal must be carefully considered in determining the vaccination schedule. The use of MLV-containing immunosuppressive agents should be planned to avoid giving them at times when the animals have low immunocompetence or are immunosuppressed. Using mucosal vaccination routes that minimize induced immunosuppression and interference by maternal antibody is also helpful.",
