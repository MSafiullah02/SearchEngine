            "text": "Enterovirus 68 (EV68) is a unique virus in the enterovirus genus as it shares characteristics with rhinoviruses, such as infection of the respiratory tract and acid lability [1]. EV68 does not follow the usual summer-autumn seasonality observed for most other enterovirus species [2], although a recent outbreak in the Netherlands occurred in the autumn of 2010 between September and November [3]. It was first isolated from throat swabs collected from four hospitalised children in 1962 in the USA [4] and together with EV70 and EV94, was classified as enterovirus species D. Rhinovirus 87 was found to be identical to EV68 and reclassified into enterovirus species D [1], [5], [6]. Apart from respiratory tract infections, EV68 has also been implicated in some rare cases of fatal central nervous system infection [2], [7]. An American surveillance system reported the most common age group affected by EV68 to be children aged between 1 and 4 years, but noted that about a quarter of all infections were reported in adults [2]. A more recent study found >50% of all EV68 infections occurred in adults over the age of 40 [3].",

Enterovirus surveillance in the USA between 1970 and 2005 showed that EV68 was one of the most rarely reported serotype with 26 reports observed over 36 years of surveillance in USA [2]. However, in the last few years between 2008 and 2010, an increasing number of clusters of acute respiratory illness associated with EV68 were reported in Asia, Europe, and the USA [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. Some recent observations of increase in cases could be partly due to enhanced surveillance in patients with asthma [1]. However, a review of recent EV68 reports suggested that the increase may not be entirely accounted for by reporting bias, as reports have come independently from countries in different continents over the same period and some countries, like USA and Japan, have been conducting continuous enterovirus surveillance for many years. A retrospective study in the Netherlands using samples dating back to 1996 confirmed the re-emergence of EV68 [3]. In many cases, EV68 was the sole enterovirus serotype detected and was associated with severe or even fatal disease (Table S1).",

The nucleic acid targets of the multiplex panel consisted of influenzaviruses A and B, parainfluenzaviruses 1\u20134, respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, human metapneumovirus, adenoviruses, coronaviruses, bocavirus and entero/rhinoviruses. Respiratory specimens used include nasopharyngeal aspirate, nasal swab, throat swab and bronchoalveolar lavage. Samples that tested positive for entero/rhinovirus RNA were further analysed by direct sequencing into individual enterovirus and rhinovirus subtypes. This study was considered by the Chairman of the Research Ethics Committee of St. Thomas' Hospital and was advised that ethical review of this study was not required under the terms of the Governance Arrangements for Research Ethics Committees in the UK (St Thomas' Research Ethics Committee Reference: 10/08). The demographics of EV68 positive patients and patients positive for other entero/rhinoviruses were compared by descriptive analyses. Pearson's chi square test, Fisher's exact test or one-way ANOVA were used for analysis and p-values<0.05 were considered significant. All analyses were performed in SPSS Statistics 19.",

Phylogenetic analysis of this region showed close clustering of the 2009 UK strains with 6 other Filipino strains from 2008, whereas the 2010 UK strains together with the 2009 09-70 strains form a separate cluster (Figure 1). Comparing the sequence from 2009 and 2010 showed the presence of eight nucleotide variations between the two years in the 5\u2032NTR (Table 2). Several of these mutations are reported for the first time (T318C and C319T in 2010, and A495G in 2009 sequences, using the Fermon strain as reference). In addition, two blocks of deletions (681\u2013704 and 717\u2013727) were noted in the 5\u2032NTR among the more recently reported Japanese isolates from the literature compared to the Fermon strain [11]. Our 2009 and 2010 strains also had these deletions although the islet region between the two deletion blocks (705\u2013716) differed in at least 5 out of 12 nucleotides compared to the Japanese strains (Figure 2). Additionally, whereas the 2009 UK strains had both deletion blocks (681\u2013703 and 717\u2013728), the 2010 strains (including 09-70) only had the deletion between 681\u2013704. Whether or not these deletion blocks occurred in other EV68 strains is not known, as other EV68 5\u2032NTR sequences reported in the GenBank were not extended to cover this pre-VP4 region of the 5\u2032NTR.",

It was first described in 1962 [4] but in the ensuing 40 years, it was reported only sporadically despite regular enterovirus surveillance by public health bodies [2]. Over the last decade, and particularly in the last few years, the number of reports of EV68 increased dramatically and in some cases severe respiratory tract infections [3], [8], [9], [11], [13] and even central nervous system infections [2], [7] were reported. An increase in detection rate may be due to improved testing methods or an increase in multiplex molecular testing of respiratory samples as a result of enhanced respiratory virus surveillance. However, it is not possible to discount the possibility that EV68 is an emerging pathogen. A recent study retrospectively investigated the molecular evolution of EV68 in the VP1 region with time [3] and showed that the original Fermon strain and clusters of selected older sequences (1989\u20132002) disappeared over time with subsequent emergence and increase in number of recent strains. The presence of three separate lineages of EV68 has been proposed, but not all available EV68 strains were used in that study [3]. We, however, performed more detailed analyses, adding new sequences from the UK from 2009 and 2010, and including all available EV68 sequences from the GenBank covering 5\u2032NTR, VP4/VP2 as well as VP1.",

Worth mentioning is the difference in VP2, a surface protein on EV68. In the Fermon strain the amino acids serine and asparagine with polar uncharged side chains are in position 142 and 143. The side chains of alanine and glycine in lineage 1 are hydrophobic and neutral, whereas threonine and glutamic acid in lineage 2 are polar uncharged and negatively charged. These amino acid changes might result in different biological behaviour or even altered antigenicity.",

The relatedness between strains from different countries suggests that EV68 circulated rapidly between countries and continents. It is also possible that the prevalence of the EV68 strains in each country is dictated by the local herd immunity. A study in Finland has shown a high population seroprevalence of EV68 [17]. Hence, EV68 has been circulating in the community for many years. The lack of previous detection may be due to the presence of many transient and sub-clinical infections which were not tested. EV68 is an RNA virus with known potential of undergoing antigenic change. This study corroborates previous evidence that a rapid change is occurring in EV68, as reported for other human enteroviruses such as EV71 and echovirus 30 [18], [19], [20].",

So far, no evidence of inter-typic recombination between 5\u2032NTR and VP1 was observed from our limited sequence data and that in the literature (Figure S6). Only few studies of EV68 have investigated multiple genomic regions (Table S2) which greatly restricted the analysis of inter-typic and inter-lineage recombination. No bootstrap supported clustering between the lineages could be identified in the 5\u2032NTR due to the high conservation in this region which prevented the analysis of inter-lineage recombination between 5\u2032NTR and VP1. No evidence of inter-lineage recombination of strains was observed on analysis of available sequences covering VP4/VP2 and VP1 (n = 70). Apart from the 4 full genome sequences, only the American sequences (n = 15, 1963\u20132003) cover the 3D polymerase region. The reporting of more full viral genome sequences is required to help in the analysis of recombination.",
