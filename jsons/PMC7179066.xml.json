Despite being from similar coronavirus families, and the case fatality rate of SARS appears higher, the R0 of the SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is greater. This results in a greater spread and a higher raw number of deaths.2 In Italy, the case fatality rate has been high, with 16,654 deaths out of 136,110 positive cases as of April 9, 2020, with health care professionals being at highest risk for infection, accounting for around 10% of positive cases (Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0; https://www.epicentro.iss.it/coronavirus/sars-cov-2-sorveglianza-dati).",

In Italy, there is a high rate of health care worker\u2013related infection leading to self-isolation, hospitalization, and critical care admission, with its consequences on health care delivery and thewell-being of the workforce. One of the key concerns with the SARS-CoV-2 virus is that the modality for transmission remains uncertain, as \u201cairborne diffusion cannot be ruled out at this stage.\u201d3 Compounding this uncertainty is the potential for the virus to variably survive on different surfaces and a lack of vaccine or specific treatment.2 There are some suggestions that the virus should be treated on bio-safety level 4,4 which is obviously not feasible in pandemic settings.",

We strongly advocate for the conduct of rapid sequence intubation with full-dose neuromuscular blockade to minimize the risk of coughing and the use of videolaryngoscopy, possibly with separate screen, as well as using a preloaded bougie or stylet as routine adjunct to maximize first-pass success.2",

Unfortunately, hypoxemia is a hallmark of COVID-19 patients requiring tracheal intubation, and patients do not tolerate the cessation of oxygen supplementation or apnea well. Conventional preoxygenation might be difficult and relatively ineffective;thus, we usually discontinue already ongoing noninvasive ventilation or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), turning the ventilator off and slowly removing facemask starting from the inferior edge (toward the patient\u2019s feet) to depressurize the circuit before proceeding with tracheal intubation. Should ventilation be needed, we advocate that it should be gently provided with Mapleson C (Waters; Covidien, Mirandola, Italy) circuit with a double filter setting (Figure). Despite the time-critical nature of airway management in critically ill patients with COVID-19, we recommend a rapid airway assessment be performed allowing for early planning of airway management to avoid unexpected deterioration and clinical decisionmaking.2",
