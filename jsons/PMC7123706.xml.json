            "text": "Historically, the first quantitative attempt to understand and prevent infectious diseases dates back to 1760 when Bernoulli studied the effectiveness of inoculation against Smallpox [1]. Since then, and despite some initial lulls [2], an intense research activity has developed a rigorous formulation of pathogens\u2019 spreading. In this chapter, we present different approaches to model and predict the spreading of infectious diseases at different geographical resolutions and levels of detail. We focus on airborne illnesses transmitted from human to human. We are the carriers of such diseases. Our contacts and mobility are the crucial ingredients to understand and model their spreading. Interestingly, the access to large-scale data describing these human dynamics is a recent development in epidemiology. Indeed, for many years only the biological roots of transmission were clearly understood, so it is not surprising that classical models in epidemiology neglect realistic human contact structures or mobility in favor of more mathematically tractable and simplified descriptions of unstructured populations. We start our chapter with these modeling approaches that offer us an intuitive way of introducing the basic quantities and concepts in epidemiology.",

In particular, we consider GLEAM [3, 4], EpiSims [5], and FLuTE [6]. The first model is based on the metapopulation framework, a paradigm where the inter-population dynamics is modeled using detailed mobility patterns, while the intra-population dynamics is described by coarse-grained techniques. The other tools are, instead, agent-based model (ABM). This class of tools guarantees a very precise description of the unfolding of diseases, but need to be fed with extremely detailed data and are not computationally scalable. For these reasons their use so far has been limited to the study of disease spread within a limited numbers of countries. In comparison, metapopulation models include a reduced amount of data, while the approximated description of internal dynamics allows scaling the simulations to global scenarios.",

Large degree nodes (hubs) facilitate an extremely efficient spreading of the infection by directly connecting many otherwise distant nodes. As soon as the hubs become infected diseases are able to reach a large fraction of the nodes in the network. Real interaction networks are extremely fragile to disease spreading. While this finding is somehow worrisome, it suggests very efficient strategies to control and mitigate the outbreaks. Indeed, hubs are central nodes and play a crucial role in the network connectivity [12] and by vaccinating a small fraction of them one is able to quickly stop the spread of the disease and protect the rest of the population. It is important to mention that in realistic settings the knowledge of the networks\u2019 structure is often limited. Hubs might not be easy to easily known and other indirect means must be employed. Interestingly, the same feature of hubs that facilitates the spread of the disease also allows for their easy detection. Since high degree nodes are connected to a large number of smaller degree nodes, one may simply randomly select a node, A, from the network and follow one of its links to reach another node, B. With high probability, node B has higher degree than A and is likely a hub. This effect became popularized as the friend paradox: on average your friends have more friends than you do [12]. Immunizing node B is then much more effective than immunizing node A. Remarkably, as counter-intuitive as this methodology might seem, it works extremely well even in the case of quickly changing networks [30\u201332].",

It was this feature what proved invaluable when it came to determine the proper value of R\n0. By plugging in a given set of parameters one is able to generate several hundreds or thousands of in silico outbreaks. Each outbreak contains information not only about the number of cases in each city or country as a function of time but also information about the time when the first case occurs within a given country. In general, each outbreak will be different due to stochasticity and by combining all outbreaks generated for a certain parameter set we can calculate the probability distribution of the arrival times. The number of times that an outbreak generated the seeding of a country, say the UK, in the same day as it occurred in reality provides us with a measure of how likely the parameter values used are. By multiplying this probability for all countries with a known arrival time we can determine the overall Likelihood of the simulation: 4.12\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\displaystyle{ \\mathcal{L} =\\prod _{c}P_{c}\\left (t_{c}\\right ) }$$\n\\end{document}\u2112=\u220fcPctc where the product is taken over all countries c with known arrival time t\nc and the probability distribution of arrival times, \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$P_{c}\\left (t\\right )$$\n\\end{document}Pct is determined numerically for each set of input values.

One might start by determining the size of the household by extracting from the distribution of household size of the country of interest and selecting the age and gender of the head of the household proportionally to the number of heads of households for that household size that are in each age group. Conditional on this synthetic individual we can then generate the remaining members, if any, of the household. The required conditional probability distributions and correlation tables can be easily generated [54] from high quality census data that can be found for most countries in the world. This process is repeated until enough synthetic households have been generated. Households are then aggregated into neighborhoods by selecting from the households according to the distribution of households in a specific neighborhood.

Launched in November 2008 together with a Nature paper [80] describing its methodology, it has continuously made predictions on the course of seasonal influenza in 29 countries around the world.3The method used by GFT is extremely simple. The percentage of ILI visits, a typical indicator used by surveillance systems to monitor the unfolding of the seasonal flu, is estimated with a linear model based on search engine queries. This approach is general, and used in many different fields of Science. A quantity of interest, in this case the percentage of ILI visits P, is estimated using a correlated signal, in this case the ILI related queries fraction Q, that acts as surrogate. The fit allows the estimate of P as a function of the value of Q: 4.14\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\displaystyle{ \\mathrm{logit}\\left (P\\right ) =\\beta _{0} +\\beta _{1}\\mathrm{logit}\\left (Q\\right )+\\epsilon, }$$\n\\end{document}logitP=\u03b20+\u03b21logitQ+\ud835\udf16, where \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$$\\mathrm{logit}\\left (x\\right ) =\\ln \\left ( \\frac{x} {1-x}\\right )$$\n\\end{document}logitx=lnx1\u2212x, \u03b2\n0 and \u03b2\n1 are fitting parameters, and \u03b5 is an error term. As clear from the expression, the GFT is a simple linear fit, where the unknown parameters are determined considering historical data. The innovation of the system lies on the definition of Q that is evaluated using hundreds of billions of searches on Google. Indeed, GFT scans all the queries we submit to Google, without using information about users\u2019 identity, in search of those that ILI related. This is the paradigm of passive data collection in digital epidemiology. In the original model the authors measured the correlation of 50 millions search queries with historic CDC data, finding that 45 of them were enough to ensure the best correlation between the number of searches and the number of ILI cases. The identity of such terms has been kept secret in order to avoid changes in users\u2019 behavior. However, the authors provided a list of topics associated with each one of them: 11 were associated with influenza complications, 8 to cold/flu remedies, 5 to general terms for influenza, etc. Although the search for the terms has been performed without prior information, none of the most representative terms were unrelated to the disease. In these settings GFT showed a mean correlation of 0. 97 with real data and was able to predict the surveillance value with 1\u20132 weeks ahead.",

The basic intuition is that Wikipedia is used to learn more about a diseases or a medication. Plus, the website is so popular that is most likely one of the first results of search queries on most search engines. The methods proposed so far monitor a set of pages related to the disease under study. Examples are Influenza, Cold, Fever, Dengue, etc. Page views at the daily or weekly basis are then used a surrogates in linear fitting models. Interestingly, the correlation with surveillance data ranges from 0. 02 in the case of Ebola to 0. 99 in for ILIs [75, 76], and allows accurate predictions up to 2 weeks ahead. One important limitation of Wikipedia based methods is the lack of geographical granularity. Indeed, the view counts are reported irrespective of readers\u2019 location but the language of the page can be used as a rough proxy for location. Such approximation might be extremely good for localized languages like Italian but it poses strong limitations in the case of global languages like English. Indeed, it is reported that 51 % of pages views for English pages are done in the USA, 11 % in the UK, and the rest in Australia, Canada and other countries [76]. Besides, without making further approximation such methods cannot provide indications at scales smaller than the country level.",

Nevertheless, GFT missed high 100 out of 108 weeks in the season 2011\u20132012.

By construction, GFT relies just on simple correlations causing it to detect not only the flu but also things that correlate strongly with the flu such as winter patterns. This is likely one of the reasons why the model was not able to capture the unfolding of an off-season pandemic such as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Also, changes in the Google search engine, that can inadvertently modify users\u2019 behavior, were not taken into account in GFT. This factor alone possibly explains the large overestimation of the peak height in 2013. Plus, simple auto-regressive models using just CDC data can perform as well or better than GFT [84]. The parable of GFT clearly shows both the potential and the risks of digital tools for epidemic predictions. The limitations of GFT can possibly affect all similar approaches based on digital passive data collection. In particular, the use of simple correlations measures does not guarantee the ability of capturing the phenomena across different scales in space and time with respect to those used in the training. Not to mention that correlations might be completely spurious. In a recent study for example, a linear model based on Twitter simply informed with the timeline of the term zombie was shown to be a good predictor of the seasonal flu [71].",
