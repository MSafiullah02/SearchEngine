For example, the 2008 melamine contamination of milk in China caused six infant deaths and stirred a public outcry about the country\u2019s food safety system. As melamine contamination spread to different milk brands and milk-containing food manufactured by different producers, imports and sales of Chinese dairy products were banned by over 10 countries (Chan & Lai, 2009). The vaccine scandal in 2016, involving illegal vaccines worth nearly $90 million that had been sold in at least 24 provinces since 2011, caused public panic across China (Wang & Burkitt, 2016). The vaccine produced in Shandong province in eastern China was not stored and transported in the required cold-chain conditions; thus patients taking the ineffective vaccine could suffer severe side effects or even death. Concerns were raised on food and medicine safety regulations and on the transport conditions and traceability along the global supply chain.",

Every year there are about 400 million tons of agricultural products in circulation (Zhiyan Research, 2016). However, cold-chain supply for perishable products has not kept up with the rapidly expanding market. Temperature-sensitive biopharmaceutical products also require cold-chain supply. However, at present, the biopharmaceutical cold-chain monitoring system scarcely exists in China. Li, Li, and Shuo (2008) discussed the \u201cbroken cold-chain\u201d problem in the transportation of products from the pharmaceutical manufacturing factory to patients. Temperature-sensitive products arrive damaged or degraded because of a broken cold chain, which arises from problems concerning management and regulation mechanisms. Rossetti and Handfield (2011) reviewed the radical changes of biopharmaceutical supply chains and identified the major drivers of associated management. Obviously, both the perishable food and biopharmaceutical markets are in urgent need of improved cold-chain systems to ensure the quality and safety of products during the distribution process.",

The vegetable and fruit market is relatively balanced in demand and supply. In contrast, the milk market is quite imbalanced as the output is mainly from China\u2019s western and northeastern regions, but the more developed eastern region has higher consumption. Thus, milk products need cross-regional transportation and distribution from the western and northeastern regions to the eastern region cities.

In contrast, the rate of circulation of perishables under cold-chain conditions in Europe and North America was over 95%. The rates of loss of fruit and vegetables, meat, and aquatic foods during the logistics process in China were as much as 15%, 8%, and 10%, while that in developed countries was less than 5%, and only 2% the United States (Ding, 2010). The high rate of loss of fresh agricultural products in China is due to the dispersed and small size of farm supply, incomplete refrigeration facilities, a lack of professionalized logistics services, and poor organization of circulation. For example, one critical process in the cold chain is precooling, which restrains the respiration of fresh agricultural products to avoid decomposition. Precooling requires investment into dedicated cold-chain facilities, but owners of small farms cannot afford such investment for fresh agricultural products. Moreover, the wide geographical distribution of supply sources for products such as milk aggravates the difficulties of achieving fast delivery.\n",

With the increasing public awareness of food quality and drug safety, the traditionally fragmented perishable product markets have undergone rapid structural changes in the last two decades. The trend in research interests has now shifted to quality control, product traceability and supervision, and coordination in the entire cold chain. Study showed that food safety measures in developed countries have a strong impact on export-oriented supply chains in developed countries (Henson, Brouder, & Mitullah, 2000). Cold chain is changing from a system dominated by producers/exporters (often run by government bodies and producer groups) feeding products into traders and wholesalers toward a system dominated by end-customers (Drewry Shipping Consultants, 2003). Research also focused on the increasing importance of biopharmaceutical cold-chain management as a result of the growing market, the requirements for storage and distribution, the monitoring of temperature, and regulatory trends (Bishara, 2006). It was also found that the need for appropriate equipment to store and transport vaccines in developing countries led to innovations in refrigeration equipment as well as adoption of high-performance vaccine cold boxes and carriers (Lloyd & Cheyne, 2017).",

In terms of the cold supply chains, an analytical model of product quality and supply configurations was developed with an optimal batch size of storage, and addressed the energy and environmental concerns of cold chains (Zanoni & Zavanella, 2012). The survey of the industry experts\u2019 insights about European food service supply chains showed that the industry is aiming at creating customer value (Darkow, Foerster, & von der Gracht, 2015). The cold chains of aquatic products were also discussed and it was shown that within certain temperature range, lower temperature brings higher profit level, and their findings encouraged better temperature control of cold chains (Wu, Deng, Zhang, & Zhang, 2015). One type of cold chains, i.e., the pharmaceutical supply chain was studied with a systematic review of research on managerial issues, and the research direction about structure of pharmaceutical supply chains was highlighted (Narayana, Pati, & Vrat, 2014). Regarding the vaccine cold-chain system, three key issues were identified limiting this cold-chain system through experiment studies in 10 countries, i.e., insufficient cold-chain capacity, lack of optimal equipment or technology, and inadequate temperature monitoring and maintenance (Ashok, Brison, & Letallec, 2017).",

Porter (2001) used the terms \u201cvalue chain\u201d and \u201cvalue system\u201d to discuss company strategies in terms of the management of relationships with other firms. The value chain describes the full range of activities involved in forming a product or service from conception, through the different phases of production, and delivery to end users. The value system basically extends the idea of the value chain to interlink organizational value chains (Kaplinsky & Morris, 2001). Value-chain analysis is a powerful tool for strategic planning as it allows the value generated along the chain to be scrutinized to increase profit margin. By exploiting the upstream and downstream information flowing along the value chain, firms may try to bypass intermediaries, create better business models, or make improvements in their value-creation system. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the profitability of segments changes over time and with changes in business environment. Also, customer value theory indicates that what customers value changes over time (Flint & Mentzer, 2000; Woodruff, 1997). Therefore, it is critical to understand the dynamics of the value-chain system.",

They cut out the distributor level and sell directly to the retailer or customer to achieve forward integration. The fresh-milk producer needs quality control from the raw sources, and manufacturers are prone to integrate upstream supply and run their own refrigerated logistics, even suffering large investments and high logistical costs to do so.\n",
