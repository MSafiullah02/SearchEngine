While it is tempting to evaluate additional subgroups, such additional post hoc analyses run the risk of type I error [5]. We had prespecified two subgroups: those with ARDS and those without. We observed a relationship between driving pressure and mortality in patients with ARDS and observed no such relationship in patients without ARDS. As for our heterogeneous patient population, we believe the inclusion of all patients from multiple hospitals increases the generalizability of our findings.",

We calculated the driving pressure using measured plateau pressure minus the set PEEP, comparable to prior investigators Schmidt et al. [6] While the authors correctly assert that respiratory effort can affect the assessment of inflation pressures and plateau pressures, we described that neither spontaneous breathing nor its interaction with driving pressure had any significance in the models of patients with and without ARDS. Our patients, much like those of Schmidt et al. and like those in many hospitals, are largely spontaneous breathers.",

Transpulmonary pressure is the pressure difference between the airway opening and the pleural surface. While airway pressure is simple to obtain, estimates of pleural pressures are difficult to obtain. Esophageal manometry, a widely accepted estimate of pleural pressures, is challenging to measure and may overestimate and underestimate ventral and dorsal pleural pressures in supine patients [7]. Consequently, it is uncommonly used in ventilator management.",

We cannot deny the possibility that some subgroup of patients without ARDS might have an association between mortality and driving pressure calculated using esophageal manometry while passively breathing. However, it seems that such an association, if present, would be of limited utility in guiding ventilator management for patients without ARDS.",
