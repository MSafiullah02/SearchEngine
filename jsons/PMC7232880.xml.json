Additionally, studies had reported that a considerable number of patients with COVID-19 were complicated by underlying diseases such as hypertension and the proportion of patients with hypertension was high. Peng et al. showed that among 138 COVID-19 patients, the proportion of patients with hypertension was the highest (43/138, 31.2%) (3). Huang et al. also found that 15% of patients with COVID-19 had hypertension, ranking second among all comorbidities (4). In addition, there were reports that most of the deaths disclosed during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic were complicated by hypertension. However, at present, there were no researches about the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with hypertension and the effects of taking ACEI or ARB drugs on patients\u2019 prognosis.

We observed that most patients used antiviral drugs (Arbidol Tablets or Lopinavir and Ritonavir Tablets) and antibiotics, and some patients used low-dose hormones (methylprednisolone) and immune globulin, and some critically ill patients had used oxygen therapy. In studies with limited conditions and data, it can be seen that there was no difference in cure rate between the hypertension group and the non-hypertension group, while the mortality rate in the hypertension group was higher, and the prognosis seems to be worse. However, it should be noted that the patients in the hypertension group were older and had a higher proportion of major comorbidities, which indicates that the elderly and comorbidities together constitute risk factors for poor prognosis to a certain extent.",

            "text": "Blood pressure is affected by many molecules, such as endothelin-1 (7), AngII, etc. (8,9). Like AngII, ACE2 belongs to the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system and kallikrein\u2013bradykinin system family and is also a blood pressure regulating protein (10,11), which can degrade AngII to form Ang1-7 and degrade Des-Arg (9) bradykinin (DABK) to an active peptide (12). As we all know, AngII and DABK can bind to corresponding receptors and play physiological roles such as constricting blood vessels, promoting value-added, inflammation, neutrophil infiltration, and pulmonary fibrosis (12,13). While Ang1-7 can bind to specific Mas receptors and exert diastolic blood vessels, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, anti-fibrotic, and anti-alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis. Therefore, ACE2 indirectly exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-lung injury effects. Animal experiments show that ACE2 expression in hypertensive rats is decreased (14,15). ACE2 is also the binding protein of novel coronaviruses (16) like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (17). In studies on SARS, researchers found that coronavirus can cause ACE 2 levels to decline or even be absent (18,19), but the expression of ACE remains unchanged, and the balance of ACE2 and ACE in lung is broken (20), leading to Ang\u2161 elevation and activation of the DABK-BK1 receptor pathway work together to cause lung inflammation, apoptosis, and accelerated lung injury. Because novel coronavirus and SARS both use ACE2 as a receptor, we speculate that novel coronavirus and SARS have similar mechanisms of action (Figure 1).",

The results of this study show that COVID-19 patients with a history of hypertension had lower lymphocyte count. In reports by Peng et al., a persistent decline in lymphocyte counts was observed in death cases (3). Chen et al. also reported that patients with COVID-19 who were over 50 years of age, and low lymphocyte counts can easily turn into severe cases (21). Maybe the lymphocyte count could reflect the severity of the condition in patients with COVID-19 to some extent, and this may explain the increased mortality in patients with a history of hypertension. Whether lymphopenia is due to the reduction of ACE2 caused by novel coronavirus invasion in COVID-19 patients with hypertension, the increase of AngII and Des-Arg bradykinin caused lung injury and inflammatory response, needs further basic experimental research.",

Some scholars believe that ACEIs should be discontinued, while other scholars believe that the recommendations to discontinue ACEIs have no scientific basis. In our data analysis, we saw that a considerable number of cases were complicated by hypertension, so we further collected the patient\u2019s previous medication situation, and grouped them according to whether they were taking ACEI or ARB drugs. Statistical analysis under limited data showed that the prognosis of the two groups was not statistically different, but we need to note that there was a statistical difference in the age of the two groups. Further logistic regression analysis showed that patients whether had a history of taking ACEI or ARB were not correlated with prognosis. Studies show that both ACEI and ARB can cause increased expression of ACE2 (22,23). As the angiotensin type I receptor, ARB can increase Ang2, and then compensatingly increasing ACE2 expression. ACEI prevents Ang1 from forming Ang2, which in turn promotes ACE2 expression. But whether both types of drugs will affect COVID-19 patients with hypertension require further research.",
