Health care systems worldwide should be prepared for an unusually high volume of patients in the next few weeks to months. Even the most efficient radiology department will undergo tremendous stress when victims of a mass casualty flood the emergency department and in turn the radiology department. A significant increase is expected in the number of imaging studies ordered for the initial diagnosis and treatment follow-up of cases of COVID-19. Here, we highlight recommendations for developing and implementing a mass casualty incident (MCI) plan for a viral outbreak, such as the current COVID-19 infection. The MCI plan consists of several steps, including preparation, mobilization of resources, imaging chain, adjusting imaging protocols, and education, such as MCI plan simulation and in-service training. Having an MCI plan in place for a viral outbreak will protect patients and staff and ultimately decrease virus transmission. The use of simulations will help identify throughput and logistical issues.",

The technologist responds, \"Just me.\" You know the CT image acquisition will not take much time, but how much time is needed to transport each patient and clean the CT scanner, in addition to the extra time for the CT technologist to adhere to standard, droplet, and airborne precautions?

An MCI is an event that overwhelms a hospital's available resources, both structural and technological [1] . Conventionally, this would include terrorist attacks, bombings, mass shootings, and natural disasters. An infectious disease outbreak, however, could also quickly exhaust a hospital's resources. In the case of a viral outbreak such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the inciting event leads to a more protracted course of resource use and depletion. Radiologists can play an important adjunct role in triaging and diagnosing patients during a MCI, including a COVID-19 outbreak. Even the most efficient radiology department will undergo tremendous stress when victims of a mass casualty flood the emergency department and in turn the radiology department. This plan will answer many of the questions that affect the radiology response for the emergency department and inpatient imaging, but it is not tailored toward planning or discussion of challenges in the workflow of outpatient imaging.",

The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kits disseminated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are considered the gold of standard for COVID-19 diagnosis [7] , but several studies have shown that a negative initial result does not exclude COVID-19 infection [8, 9] . Additionally, it may take up to 48 hours to receive the final results, which limits the utility of this diagnostic test during initial triage of these patients in the emergency setting. In a recent study published in Radiology, based on a retrospective study of 1,014 patients, the diagnostic sensitivity of chest CT for COVID-19 is significantly greater than that of RT-PCR (98% versus 59%), but the specificity is limited (25%) [7] . Proposed explanations for the decreased sensitivity of RT-PCR include low viral load, immature development of RT-PCR technology, and suboptimal clinical sampling. This study concluded that chest CT",

This is considered the \"surge\" period, in which hospital resources are rapidly used and possibly overwhelmed by the large number of patient casualties examined within a very short period [11] . Patients are triaged by first responders (paramedics, firefighters, police officers, military personnel) before entering the hospital alongside walking wounded, who arrive by other means. During a viral outbreak, however, there will be a steady increase in patients over a longer period of time, a \"protracted surge.\" This can similarly overburden and inevitably overwhelm a hospital's resources over the span of days, weeks, or even months.",

Imaging acquisition time is trivial compared with the time to transport the patient, don personal protective equipment, and clean the scanner. If an institution has opted to use chest CT for screening, low-dose chest CT has been shown to be a suitable option for evaluation of pneumonia. Given the added time burden and the potential increase in radiologic examinations in the emergency department and inpatient services, consider adjusting imaging protocols for polytrauma patients and limiting time-intensive studies (ie, gated CT angiography and multiphase imaging).",

This can also identify the minimum number of personnel needed from start to finish of the examination. In viral outbreaks, staff may be absent because of illness, so it is important that during these simulations, personnel (ie, x-ray and CT technologists, transporters) should be systematically removed to test how these affect turnaround times and throughput. Although large-scale simulations can be expensive and time-consuming, require a lot of space, and disrupt the day-to-day operations, they have many invaluable benefits. The use of live moulaged actors has the added benefit of offering more realistic encounters [17] . Alternatively, the use of tabletop exercises for MCI can also play a role in MCI simulations.
