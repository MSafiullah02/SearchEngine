The parents informed the study personnel when the child developed URI symptoms. Children were seen by a study physician and followed after URI onset for the occurrence of AOM. At each visit, otoscopic and physical examinations and tympanometry were performed. Acute otitis media was considered to have complicated URI if it occurred within 28 days of URI onset. Acute otitis media was defined as acute onset of symptoms, signs of tympanic membrane inflammation (erythema, opacification, or bugling), and the presence of fluid in the middle ear. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of University of Texas Medical Branch, and informed consent was obtained from the guardians of all study children.",

Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an indicator of sample integrity and extracted nucleic acid quality. TaqMan probes were used to track the specific amplification in the duplex. Quantitative PCR was completed in a C1000 thermocycler equipped with a CFX reaction module (Bio-Rad) using the following parameters: Cycle 1: 95\u00b0C (3 minutes); Cycle 2, Step 1: 95\u00b0C (15 seconds), Step 2: 60\u00b0C (45 seconds), repeated 50 times. Fluorescent signal data were collected at the end of each annealing and extension step. Viral genomic titers were extrapolated from standard curves of plasmids harbouring the PCR targets generated in parallel for each run. A parallel qPCR reaction for GAPDH [17] was completed on every clinical sample to evaluate RNA and cDNA quality. Detection of hGAPDH at less than 500 copies/reaction from the NPS sample suggested inadequacy of the specimen and led to the exclusion of the sample from further analysis. Viral load was calculated as HBoV1-DNA copies/mL of the original specimen based on the original dilution of the specimens and subsequent assay dilutions. Due to unknown dilution of 58 NPS samples, viral load analysis was available in NPSs from 649 URI episodes.",

Of URI associated with the presence of a single virus, the rate of AOM complicating URI was 52% in HBoV1-positive episodes. The rates of AOM complicating URI for other viruses are presented in Table 2. Although presence of HBoV1 alone in the child with acute onset of URI, without other viruses detected, suggests the association between HBoV1 and acute URI symptoms, persistence of HBoV1 from previous episodes could not be ruled out. We used available longitudinal data to determine whether these children had shed HBoV1 previously. In 44 URI episodes (35 children), 15 episodes were associated with previous shedding of HBoV1 10\u201389 days previously. Of the remaining 29 episodes, there was no HBoV1 detected in the previous URI episode in 15; previous data were not available in 14 episodes (first URI episode in the study). The rate of AOM after URI was 52% (15 of 29) in cases without documented previous HBoV1 detection and 40% (6 of 13) in cases in which available data excluded HBoV1 persistence.",

However, it is known that HBoV-DNA can be detected in asymptomatic children [15] due to prolonged presence of the viral nucleic acids. Therefore, detection of HBoV1-DNA alone in the NPS might not be sufficient to document active HBoV1 infection. Unfortunately, we were unable to confirm active HBoV1 infection in our study by serology. Due to the longitudinal nature of the study and nonsevere nature of viral URI and AOM, we were not able to include blood drawing for acute and convalescent serology in our design. Nevertheless, indirect evidence exists to support the role of active HBoV1 infection in our cases with URI associated with HBoV1 alone. First, we used extensive viral diagnostic methods to detect a variety of common respiratory viruses during symptomatic URI, although we did not detect less common, newly described viruses such as polyomaviruses and parechoviruses. Negative findings for other viruses but positive finding for HBoV1 only suggested the association between HBoV1 (a recognized respiratory virus) and acute symptoms. Second, viral load in the cases of HBoV1 alone was relatively high (mean viral load, 1.8 \u00d7 1010 copies/mL of the original sample; range, 3.2 \u00d7 103 to 5.5 \u00d7 1011). Lastly, in our recently published study using NPS samples from the same cohort [21], concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase, a marker for cellular injury during inflammation, are associated with the rate of AOM complication after URI and with the presence of adenovirus, rhinovirus, and HBoV1. These findings together support the association between the presence of HBoV1 and its clinical significance during URI episodes for which no other virus was detected.",

The higher incidence of HBoV detection in longitudinal studies, compared with that in cross-sectional studies, is likely from prolonged presence of the virus in the respiratory tract. The same reason may also explain high frequencies of concurrent detection of HBoV with other viruses, which has been reported to occur up to 72% [13, 15, 22, 24\u201325]. In our study, 45% of children with HBoV1 in the NPS had the virus detected more than once. Prolonged shedding of HBoV1 in nasal secretions has been described up to 11 weeks in children attending day care [15] and up to 3 months in otitis-prone children [26]. Extended viral shedding has also been observed with other DNA-viruses; in the same study population, we studied genetic sequences of adenoviruses and found that repeated presence could be from the same viral serotype and strain detected continuously or intermittently, or different serotype or strain detected sequentially [27]. Further studies of the viral genome in children with sequential HBoV1 are required, to differentiate between prolonged presence of the viral and reinfection with different HBoV isolates. These types of studies will help elucidate the natural history and foster the understanding of the pathogenicity of HBoV1 infection.",
