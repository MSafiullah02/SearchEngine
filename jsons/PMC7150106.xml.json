            "text": "Shoseiryuto is used for symptoms such as runny nose, cough, allergic rhinitis, bronchitis, and so on (Ikeda et al., 1994). It has been reported that shoseiryuto possesses antiinfluenza activity in vivo. It was first described that replication of the virus in the nasal cavity and spread of the virus to the lung are efficiently inhibited in intranasal infection with a mouse-adapted influenza strain, A/PR/8/34, in BALB/c mice when shoseiryuto is orally administered (Nagai and Yamada, 1994). Shoseiryuto increases the antiviral IgA antibody in nasal and bronchoalveolar washes of infected mice. It did not stimulate type I interferon (IFN) induction in this study (Nagai and Yamada, 1994); however, other in vitro studies with human cell lines have suggested that shoseiryuto shows type I IFN\u2013mediated inhibition of other viruses such as ganciclovir-resistant human cytomegalovirus (Murayama et al., 2006) and human respiratory syncytial virus (Chang et al., 2013). Regarding influenza virus infection, there have been no reports on inhibitory effects on viral growth by shoseiryuto in a cultured-cell system. Antiinfluenza activity of shoseiryuto is most likely through immunostimulative adjuvant-like activity but not direct action on the virus in any case. Therefore, it is proposed that shoseiryuto is useful for the treatment of influenza virus infection with a history of influenza virus infection and/or as an influenza vaccine adjuvant (Nagai and Yamada, 1998, Yamada and Nagai, 1998). In fact, the same group explored the active ingredient in shoseiryuto and tested for influenza adjuvant activity. Oral administration of one of the ingredients, pinellic acid, to mice with influenza hemagglutinin (HA) vaccine enhanced antiviral IgA antibody in nasal and bronchoalveolar washes, suggesting that pinellic acid may provide a safe and potent oral adjuvant for nasal influenza HA vaccine (Nagai et al., 2002).",

The influenza adjuvant activity of juzentaihoto was tested using 91 subjects with a minimum age of 65 years by measuring the antibody titer after influenza vaccination (Saiki et al., 2013). The investigation indicated a significant increase in hemagglutination inhibition titer against A/Victoria/210/2009 (H3N2) among the tested vaccine strains, A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), H3N2, and B/Brisbane/60/2008. However, the mechanisms underlying the specificity of juzentaihoto for the H3N2 strain remain to be discovered, although a study has reported that juzentaihoto stimulates the IFN-\u03b1 response by affecting the responsible transcription factors, IRF-3/7 (Munakata et al., 2012).",

Hochuekkito is a Kampo medicine that is used for treating functional conditions such as general fatigue, compromised state, and gastrointestinal motility disorder (Yanagihara et al., 2013). Hochuekkito administered orally before, on the day of, or after influenza virus infection is found to increase survival rate, suppress viral growth in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and inhibit the lung index in mice. Administration of hochuekkito in mice elevates the concentration of IFN-\u03b1 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and decreases inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1, IL-6, and granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony stimulation factor, but not tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and IFN-\u03b3 (Mori et al., 1999). Furthermore, it has been reported that hochuekkito enhances the expression of antimicrobial peptides, defensins, in mice compared to control subjects (Dan et al., 2013). Synergistic antiinfluenza effects of hochuekkito with oseltamivir phosphate also have been reported in mice (Ohgitani et al., 2014). Furthermore, a clinical study has indicated that preoperative administration of hochuekkito may ameliorate an excessive postoperative inflammatory response and prolonged immunosuppressed state, resulting in fewer postoperative infectious complications (Iwagaki and Saito, 2013).",

To assess its mechanistic aspects, an in vitro study has tested the effects of shosaikoto on the production of IL-12 in circulating mononuclear cells from liver cirrhosis patients (Yamashiki et al., 1999). The group determined IL-12 levels in the monocyte/macrophage fraction and the lymphocyte fraction of peripheral blood obtained from 11 HCV-positive liver cirrhosis patients and 12 healthy subjects and found that IL-12 produced by the patients was significantly lower than that produced by healthy subjects. Shosaikoto stimulation of the monocyte/macrophage fraction or the lymphocyte fraction increased the levels of IL-12 about threefold, which was almost the same level as that of healthy subjects. The study concluded that one of the possible mechanisms of the macrobiotic effects of shosaikoto in liver cirrhosis patients may be the improvement in IL-12 production.",

A mouse study indicated that oxymatrine has hepatoprotective activity against acute liver injury induced by allyl alcohol (Liu et al., 1994). Antifibrotic activity of oxymatrine in d-galactosamine-induced rat liver fibrosis has been predicted to be partly through inhibition of lipid peroxidation. Immune-stimulative activity that changes the immune response of HBV-transgenic mice from a Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) to a Th1 (IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2) response has been also reported (Dong et al., 2002, Yang et al., 2002). Because these animal studies and cell-based experiments showed promising effects against HCV infection, several clinical studies have been conducted (Li et al., 1998, Mao et al., 2004). A review paper has evaluated the efficacy of several natural products reported in the treatment of chronic HCV subjects. The paper concluded that the results are promising and indicate the need for further evaluation in HCV cases (Azzam et al., 2007).",

Scores of symptoms such as discomfort were significantly lower with the combination therapy of IFN-\u03b2 and Kampo compared to IFN-\u03b2 alone and none of the patients needed to interrupt therapy because of side effects of IFN-\u03b2. Biochemical parameters such as serum alanine aminotransferase and serum hyaluronic acid levels were better compared to IFN-\u03b2 alone.

A study has examined the inhibitory effect of shosaikoto on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Piras et al., 1997). In the study, the anti-HIV activity of shosaikoto was tested when combined with known anti-HIV drugs such as zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), or a combination of AZT/3TC. In vitro experiments indicated that shosaikoto enhanced anti-HIV activity of 3TC among the tested combinations. The authors suggested that a combination therapy of shosaikoto and 3TC has potential as a chemotherapeutic modality for HIV-1 infection. Because it has been reported that shosaikoto inhibits the reverse transcriptase of murine leukemia virus and HIV in vitro (Ono et al., 1990), this activity may be the underlying mechanism of its anti-HIV activity. Another in vitro study has reported that Polyporus sclerotium, gardenia fruit, Atractylodes lancea rhizoma, Cnidium rhizoma, and Japanese Angelica root have some anti-HIV activity (Kato et al., 2012). However, no clinical trials of shosaikoto or other Kampo medicines against HIV infection have been reported so far.",

The duration until complete resolution of hematuria was significantly shorter in the choreito-treated group (median 9 days, range 4\u201317 days) compared to the nonchoreito group (median 17 days, range 15\u201366 days; p\n = .037).

Oral immunization of mice with LacE7 with mucosal adjuvant, heat-labile enterotoxin T subunit (LTB), promotes systemic E7-specific type 1 T-cell responses and a similar effect was observed with juzentaihoto or hochuekkito as an adjuvant. Oral administration of LacE7 plus either of these Japanese Kampo medicines and LTB enhances mucosal E7-specific type 1 T-cell response by approximately threefold more than after administration of LacE7 alone. Secretion of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 into the intestinal lumen is enhanced by juzentaihoto or hochuekkito and LTB in oral administration of LacE7. Finally, these Kampo medicines enhance the mucosal type 1 immune responses to orally immunized antigen synergistically with Lactobacillus and LTB. Therefore the authors suggest that juzentaihoto or hochuekkito may be an excellent adjuvant for oral Lactobacillus-based vaccines and may have the potential to elicit extremely high E7-specific mucosal cytotoxic immune response to HPV-associated neoplastic lesions.",

A study has investigated the antibacterial effect of hochuekkito against H. pylori infection in vivo and in vitro (Yan et al., 2002). The in vitro experiments demonstrate that hochuekkito inhibits the growth of antibiotic-resistant strains of H. pylori as well as antibiotic-sensitive strains at a dose of 2.5 mg/mL. The in vivo experiments with mice orally administered hochuekkito for 7 days before or after inoculation of H. pylori showed that the bacterial load in the stomach was significantly reduced in the hochuekkito group compared with the control group. Hochuekkito administration induced IFN-\u03b3 in the gastric mucosa and there were no significant differences in bacterial load between the control and the hochuekkito-treated group in IFN-\u03b3 gene-deficient mice. Therefore, the authors suggest that the antibacterial effect of hochuekkito is partly due to IFN-\u03b3 induction and its possible clinical use for treatment of H. pylori infection.\n",
