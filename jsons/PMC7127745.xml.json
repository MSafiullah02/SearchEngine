            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious viral disease of poultry characterized by respiratory signs, nephritis and reduced egg production (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003). This disease is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the genus Gamma coronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales (ICTV, 2009) which is considered a major pathogen in poultry production (OIE, 2008). The IBV genome consists of a single-stranded positive sense RNA molecule of approximately 27.6 Kb which encodes several nonstructural proteins involved in RNA transcription and replication and four structural proteins, spike (S), small membrane (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N) (Boursnell et al., 1987). The S glycoprotein is formed by a globular S1 subunit that is anchored in the membrane by the S2 subunit (Cavanagh, 2007). The S1 subunit contains the main virus-neutralization epitopes, which are involved in the induction of neutralizing, serotype-specific haemagglutination inhibiting antibodies, and protective immunity (Cavanagh, 2003, Hodgson et al., 2004). Hence mutations within this genome region may result in the emergence of new viral variants (Moore et al., 1998).",

In Cuba, the IB control strategy is based on the use of an attenuated live vaccine strain H120 of Massachusetts (Mass) serotype (reviewed in Colas et al., 2010) and despite of the extensive vaccination performed, the presence of IBV in vaccinated flock has been recently revealed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection associated with clinical respiratory disorders in poultry (Acevedo et al., 2010).

The origin of IBV might be associated with the importation of different breeds and lines of chickens to be used for commercial chicken production. The current work constitutes the first genetic study of IBV in Cuba. Previous studies based on cross-neutralization showed the Mass genotype as the genotype that circulated in the Cuban chicken flocks (Guilarte, 1985). In the present work, the genetic analysis and the phylogenetic relationships among recent IBV Cuban isolates and reference IBV strains suggest that different variants of the virus are circulating in chicken flocks. Nevertheless, to determinate if the Cuban isolates which grouped with the DMV5642 and B1648-like genotypes have emerged as consequence of evolution or recombination events require further studies.",

ModelTest V.3.0.6 (Posada and Crandall, 1998) was used to estimate the best-fit model by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Phylogenetic relationships among IBV genotypes were analyzed using Neighbor-Joining (NJ) and Bayesian Inference (BI) as described by P\u00e9rez et al. (2011).
