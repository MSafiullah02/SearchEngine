            "text": "Inductive sites for mucosal immune responses were initially described in mucosal locations such as small intestinal Peyer's patches of the GALT (Phillips-Quagliata and Lamm, 1988). Earlier studies have shown that surgical removal of Peyer's patches from the intestine of rats does not affect the total number of IgA-containing cells in the lamina propria or the development of a normal antibody response to intestinal immunization (Heatley et al., 1981). More recently, mice lacking Peyer's patches by in utero treatment with a lymphotoxin-\u03b2 receptor-Ig molecule fusion protein developed normal mucosal and systemic immunity to oral immunization (Yamamoto et al., 2000) suggesting that alternative inductive sites for mucosal immunity are present in the GALT. In fact, other lymphoid follicles, termed \u201cisolated lymphoid follicles (ILFs)\u201d or \u201csolitary lymphoid follicles,\u201d were reported in the intestinal wall of rabbits (Keren et al., 1978), guinea pigs (Rosner and Keren, 1984), and humans (Moghaddami et al., 1998; Neutra et al., 2001). These structures have now been demonstrated in mice (Hamada et al., 2002; Fagarasan et al., 2003; Lorenz et al., 2003), where their number and maturation appear to be triggered by lumenal stimuli such as the bacterial flora (Fagarasan et al., 2003; Lorenz et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Organized lymphoid tissues, including palatine, lingual, and nasopharyngeal tonsils (Waldeyer's ring), are strategically positioned at the beginning of the digestive and respiratory tracts and are continuously exposed to ingested and inhaled antigens. These nasopharyngeal-associated lymphoepithelial tissues (NALT) possess structural features similar to both lymph nodes and Peyer's patches of the GALT (Brandtzaeg, 1984; Ogra, 1971; see Chapter 83). For example, tonsillar crypts possess a lymphoepithelium which contains M cells for selective antigen uptake as well as B and T cells, plasma cells, and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The distribution of IgA1- and IgA2-producing cells in the nasal and gastric mucosa and in lacrymal and salivary glands is similar to the distribution in tonsils, suggesting that tonsils may serve as a source for precursors of IgA plasma cells found in the upper respiratory and digestive tracts. Furthermore, tonsillectomized children display lower levels of S-IgA antibodies to the oral poliovirus vaccine than children with intact tonsils (Ogra, 1971). Others have shown that direct unilateral injection of antigens (cholera toxin B subunit [CT-B] and tetanus toxoid [TT]) into the tonsil of human volunteers resulted in the induction of mainly mucosal immune responses, manifested by the appearance of antigen-specific IgG and, to a lesser degree, IgA-forming cells (AFCs) in the injected tonsil (Quiding-J\u00e4rbrink et al., 1995a). Recent studies confirm the prevalence of IgG antibodies in tonsils and demonstrated that these structures display features of both mucosal inductive and effector sites (Boyaka et al., 2000). Therefore, the tonsils may serve as an inductive site analogous to GALT in some species. Organized BALT were also noted at airway branches of experimental animals, although these structures rarely occur in humans (Pabst, 1992).",

            "text": "Several studies have emphasized the importance of inductive sites in the nasal cavity for the generation of mucosal and systemic immune responses that may exceed in magnitude those induced by oral immunization (Bergquist et al., 1997; Di Tommaso et al., 1996; Gallichan and Rosenthal, 1995; Lubeck et al., 1994; Pal et al., 1996; Russell et al., 1996; Staats et al., 1996). When introduced into the nasal cavity, usually along with mucosal adjuvants such as CT and/or CT-B, viral and bacterial antigens induce superior immune responses in external secretions such as saliva and, surprisingly, in female genital tract secretions of rodents, rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees, and humans (Quiding-J\u00e4rbrink et al., 1995b; Russell and Mestecky, 2002). Whether such antibody responses are also induced in the male genital tract remains to be determined. Nevertheless, this finding may have important implications for the design of vaccines effective in the induction of immune responses in the genital tract (Russell and Mestecky, 2002; see Chapter 95). Although analogous studies with bacterial antigens have not been performed in humans, induction of genital tract immune responses by nasal immunization would have profound implications for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS (see Chapter 52). Thus, different mucosal immunization routes (nasal and oral) can induce generalized mucosal immune responses, although the relative representation of dominant antibody isotypes may vary. Circulating IgA AFCs induced after nasal vaccination express a more promiscuous profile of homing receptors than their corresponding counterparts raised after oral or rectal immunization (Quiding-J\u00e4rbrink et al., 1997; Kantele et al., 1998). This could explain the fact that nasal immunization appears to induce S-IgA immunity in a broader range of mucosal tissues than oral vaccination.",

            "text": "Although most investigations of GALT mucosal IgA inductive sites have primarily centered on Peyer's patches and the appendix, analogous follicular structures are also found in the large intestine, with especially pronounced accumulations in the rectum (Langman and Rowland, 1986; O'Leary and Sweeney, 1986). The potential importance of rectal lymphoid tissues as an IgA inductive site and as a source of IgA plasma cell precursors is suggested by several studies. The predominance of IgA2 cells over IgA1 cells in the lamina propria of the large intestine clearly diverges from the relative apportioning of the IgA subclass distribution in other mucosal tissues (Crago et al., 1984; Kett et al., 1986). That this is also the case in the female genital mucosal tissues (uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and vagina) (Kutteh et al., 1988) suggests that rectal lymphoid tissues may be an important source of IgA precursors destined for the genital tract. The potential importance of rectal lymphoid tissues as an inductive site is suggested from several studies performed with humans, nonhuman primates (NHPs), and mice. Rectal immunization of humans with a microbial vaccine (e.g., Salmonella typhi Ty21a) or various viruses induced specific antibodies not only at the site of immunization but also in saliva and other secretions (Forrest et al., 1990; Kozlowski et al., 1997, 2002; Russell and Mestecky, 2002; see Chapters 94 and 95). The rectal route of immunization has also been evaluated in animal experimentation. Rhesus macaques immunized rectally with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) displayed both T- and B-cell-mediated immune responses, including the induction of anti-SIV antibodies (Lehner et al., 1992, 1993). Mice immunized rectally with CT or recombinant vaccinia virus expressing gp120 of SIV also generated humoral immune responses in genital tract secretions as well as in serum; this immunization route was frequently superior to either the gastric or vaginal route (Moldoveanu et al., 1995; Haneberg et al., 1994). Therefore, the rectal immunization route appears to be effective in the induction of not only local but also generalized mucosal immune responses because of the presence of inductive site tissue. However, there are pronounced species differences with respect to the magnitude of the immune response induced: mice display a more vigorous response than humans. The type and dose of antigen, as well as the frequency of immunization, may be partially responsible for such observed differences. Further studies will be necessary to validate limited results obtained thus far, and males will be included in future immunization attempts to determine whether specific immune responses are generated in male genital tract secretions.",

Further, the mesenteric lymph nodes of orally immunized experimental animals were found to contain antigen-specific precursors of IgA plasma cells, which repopulated the lamina propria of the gut and mammary, lacrymal, and salivary glands (McDermott and Bienenstock, 1979; McWilliams et al., 1975, 1977; Roux et al., 1977). Other evidence of the existence of the CMIS in humans was provided by the finding of specific S-IgA antibodies in secretions of the intestinal, respiratory, and genital tracts, as well as in tears, saliva, and milk, and by the observation of IgA-secreting cells in peripheral blood following oral immunization (Czerkinsky et al., 1987; Kantele, 1990; Mestecky, 1987; McGhee et al., 1992). Of importance for vaccine development, as mentioned earlier, is that immunization at certain inductive sites can give rise to a humoral immune response preferentially manifested at certain effector sites and resulting in further subcompartmentalization of the CMIS. For example, repeated nasal immunization may induce elevated mucosal immune responses not only in nasal secretions but also in saliva. On the other hand, rectal vaccination may induce preferential immune responses at the site of immunization and in some instances in the female genital tract.",

In addition, pairing of \u03b14 with \u03b27 represents the major integrin molecule responsible for lymphocyte binding to MAdCAM-1 expressed on high endothelial venules (HEVs) in Peyer's patches (Holzmann et al., 1989). In contrast to the GALT, L-selectin and peripheral lymph node addressins play predominant roles in the binding of naive lymphocytes to NALT HEVs (Csencsits et al., 1999, 2001). Additional studies showed expression of L-selectin by most effector B cells induced by systemic immunization, with only a small proportion expressing \u03b14\u03b27, while the opposite was seen after enteric (oral or rectal) immunization (Quiding-Jabrink et al., 1995b, 1997). Interestingly, effector B cells induced by nasal immunization displayed a more promiscuous pattern of adhesion molecules, with a large majority of these cells expressing both L-selectin and \u03b14\u03b27 (Quiding-Jabrink et al., 1997).",

            "text": "It is now clear that chemokines are directly involved in mucosal homing of effector B and T cells. For example, loss of secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC) results in lack of naive T-cell or dendritic cell (DC) migration into spleen or Peyer's patches (Gunn et al., 1999). Further, thymus-expressed chemokine (TECK) mediated human memory T cell migration into the small intestinal lamina propria of the GI tract. In fact, gut homing \u03b14\u03b27hi T-cell expression of the TECK receptor CCR-9 (Zabel et al., 1999) and reduction in levels of total intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) occur in the small intestine of CCR9\u2212/\u2013 mice (Wurbel et al., 2001). In addition to its chemoattractant activity on T cells, TECK efficiently recruits IgA-producing but not IgG- or IgM-producing cells from spleen, Peyer's patches, and the mesenteric lymph nodes (Bowman et al., 2002). While all CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the small intestine express high levels of CCR9, only a small subset of lymphocytes in the colon are CCR9+ (Kunkel et al., 2000). Lymphocytes from other tissues, including tonsils, lung, inflamed liver, normal or inflamed skin, inflamed synovium and synovial fluid, breast milk, and seminal fluid, do not express CCR9 (Kunkel et al., 2000). Consistent with CCR9 expression, TECK expression is also restricted to the small intestine (Kunkel et al., 2000). These findings imply a restricted role for lymphocyte CCR9 and its ligand TECK in the small intestine and add support to the functional compartmentalization of immune responses in different segments of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the CMIS in general.",

Further, MEC attracts IgA-producing but not IgG- or IgM-producing AFCs from the intestines, lungs, and lymph nodes draining the bronchopulmonary tree and oral cavity (Lazarus et al., 2003). Interestingly, T cells from mucosal sites fail to respond to MEC, suggesting that distinct chemokine signaling is needed for mucosal homing of B versus T cells. This concept is further supported by the fact that CCR9, whose ligand TECK/CCL25 is predominantly restricted to the small intestine and thymus, is expressed by a fraction of IgA antibody\u2013AFCs and almost all T cells in the small intestine but by only a small percentage of plasma cells in other sites (Kunkel et al., 2003; Lazarus et al., 2003).",

However, application of antigens to mucosal areas that lack inductive sites such as intestinal Peyer's patches is usually inefficient in the generation of disseminated mucosal and systemic immune responses. For example, the administration of nonreplicating antigens in the conjunctival sac, vagina, or intestinal loops, without Peyer's patches, results in a local, low immune response (for review see Mestecky, 1987; Mestecky and McGhee, 1987). Similarly, injection of antigens into the lactating mammary or salivary glands induces S-IgA and high IgG antibody responses in milk and saliva collected from immunized glands but not in secretions of other mucosal sites (for review see Mestecky, 1987). A concomitant IgG response in plasma suggests that injection of antigens into effector sites should be considered as systemic rather than mucosal immunization. This also seems to be the case when antigens are injected in the vicinity of regional lymph nodes draining certain mucosal sites.",

However, external secretions of the female and male genital tracts (cervical mucus and vaginal wash, and pre-ejaculate and ejaculate) contain approximately equal levels of IgA and IgG of mostly circulatory origin (see Chapter 96). Therefore, systemic immunization may be of considerable importance in the induction of protective responses in the genital tract secretions. Furthermore, systemic immunization with conjugated polysaccharide (Haemophilus influenzae or Streptococcus pneumoniae)\u2013protein tetanus toxoid (TT) or diphtheria toxoid (DT) vaccine induce both IgA and IgG responses in plasma and secretions and predominantly IgA-secreting cells in the peripheral blood of systemically immunized volunteers (Lue et al., 1990; Fattom et al., 1990). Until the recent approval of the cold-adapted live attenuated influenza virus nasal vaccine (FluMist; MedImmune Vaccines, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) in June 2003, systemic immunization with inactivated or split influenza virus has been and may continue to be the vaccine of choice. Thus, systemic immunization can be used as an effective route of antigen administration and ensuing protection in several mucosally contracted diseases (see Chapter 91).",

            "text": "Another important aspect of systemic immunization concerns its primary effects on subsequent mucosal immunization. Many previous studies indicate that single and even repeated immunization at the same mucosal site is not a particularly effective mode of induction of vigorous immune responses. Instead, empirical experience convincingly demonstrates that a combination of mucosal immunization routes (e.g., oral and rectal) elicits better responses. Of upmost importance for induction of responses to HIV-1 is the need for the stimulation of both mucosal and systemic immunity. This goal may not be easily attainable by strictly mucosal (e.g., oral or nasal) immunization. However, the combination of systemic priming and mucosal boosting will most likely lead to the desired outcome. Previous experiments (Moldoveanu et al., 1993) have shown that systemic priming, even with minute doses of antigens (in this case the influenza virus) followed by mucosal boosting, elicited better mucosal and systemic immune responses than did mucosal immunization only. Furthermore, systemic priming does not preclude humoral and CMI responses induced by mucosal boosting (Belyakov et al., 1999)\u2014a distinct advantage of this sequence of immunization. The reversed order of immunizations\u2014mucosal priming and systemic boosting\u2014may create some undesirable complications (Czerkinsky et al., 1999). In a recent phase II clinical trial, intramuscular immunization with a live recombinant canarypox HIV-1 vaccine could induce CTL responses in both the systemic and mucosal compartments (Musey et al., 2003). The study also showed that CD8+ CTL clones established from rectal and systemic cells of one vaccine recipient exhibited similar Env-specific responses and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction (Musey et al., 2003). This result suggests that parenteral vaccination can induce HIV-1-specific CTLs that localize to sites of HIV-1 infection.",

            "text": "Immune responses have been induced through transdermal (skin) immunization by scarification such as in smallpox inoculation (Benenson et al., 1977). More recently, the skin emerged as an attractive target for vaccine delivery. For example, depilatory agents (Tang et al., 1997) and epidermal powder delivery system were shown to promote both mucosal and systemic immunity (Chen et al., 2001). More interestingly, several studies in humans (Glenn et al., 2000) and animal models (Glenn et al., 1998; Sharton-Kerten et al., 2000; Beignon et al., 2001; Anjuere et al., 2003; Guebre-Xabier et al., 2003) suggest that, in addition to systemic immunity, mucosal immunity can be achieved by topical application to intact skin of a vaccine antigen and the appropriate adjuvant. Adjuvants including CT, CT-B, LT, nontoxic mutants of LT, CpG, and cytokines promoted immunity to cutaneous vaccines (Scharton-Kersten et al., 2000; Beignon et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2001; Anjuere et al., 2003), suggesting that enhancement of the immune response to topical vaccines is not restricted to native enterotoxins. Epidermal dendritic cells (DCs) or Langerhans cells appear to play a major role in the immune responses to transcutaneous immunization (Baca-Estrada et al., 2002). External factors such as vitamin D or ultraviolet radiation B were also reported to regulate systemic and mucosal immunity to transcutaneous vaccines (Enioutina et al., 2002).

            "text": "Most if not all current vaccines exert their protective effect through the induction of specific Abs. Mucosal Abs, which are predominantly IgA and to a lesser degree IgG, exhibit their protective function by mechanisms that are distinct from specific antibodies present in the plasma (see Chapter 14). Inhibition of microbial adherence is a critical initial step for the protection of the host and is mediated by both specific and nonspecific mechanisms. For instance, the agglutinating ability of S-IgA specific to capsular polysaccharide of H. influenzae seems to be crucial for preventing colonization by H. influenzae (Kauppi-Korkeila et al., 1996). Furthermore, another nonspecific mechanism that inhibits microbial adherence is due to the presence of carbohydrate chains on the S-IgA molecule that bind to bacteria or other antigens (Davin et al., 1991; Wold et al., 1990). S-IgA antibodies have been shown to be effective in neutralizing viruses at different steps in the infectious process. In particular, S-IgA specific to influenza hemagglutinin can interfere with the initial binding of influenza virus to target cells or with the internalization and the intracellular replication of the virus (Armstrong and Dimmock, 1992). The S-IgA can neutralize the catalytic activity of many enzymes of microbial origin (such as neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, glycosyltransferase, and IgA-specific protease) as well as the toxic activity of bacterial enterotoxins (CT and the related LT of E. coli). In vitro experiments employing murine polarized epithelial cells have demonstrated that antibodies specific for rotavirus and hepatitis virus can neutralize the respective viruses inside the epithelial cells (Mazanec et al., 1992, 1995), and evidence has been provided that similar mechanisms occur in vivo (Burns et al., 1996). Similarly, it has been shown that transcytosis of primary HIV isolates is blocked by polymeric IgA specific to HIV envelope proteins (Bomsel et al., 1998). It should be mentioned that S-IgA antibodies appear to be important in limiting inflammatory responses at mucosal surfaces. In fact, IgA antibodies are unable to activate complement and interfere with IgM- and IgG-mediated complement activation (Griffiss and Goroff, 1983; Russell and Mansa, 1989). Furthermore, IgA can downregulate the synthesis of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 as well as enhance the production of IL-1R antagonists by LPS-activated human monocytes (Wolf et al., 1994, 1996). An additional anti-inflammatory mechanism of S-IgA-mediated protection has been recently suggested. Thus, S-IgA can colocalize with LPS in the apical recycling endosome compartment, preventing LPS-induced NF-\u03baB translocation and a subsequent proinflammatory response (Fernandez et al., 2003).",

It is now established that administration of virus into the GI tract results in a higher frequency of pCTL in Peyer's patches (Offit et al., 1991; London et al., 1987). For example, reovirus localizes to T-cell regions and is clearly associated with increased CD8+ pCTLs and memory B cell responses (London et al., 1990). Oral administration of Vaccinia to rats resulted in the induction of virus-specific CTLs in Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes (Issekutz, 1984). Virus-specific CTLs are also generated in mucosa-associated tissues by oral immunization with reovirus and rotavirus (Offit et al., 1991; London et al., 1987), and a high frequency of virus-specific CTLs are present in the Peyer's patches as early as 6 days after oral immunization. These studies suggest that oral immunization with live virus can induce antigen-specific CTLs in both mucosal inductive and effector tissues for mucosal responses and in systemic lymphoid tissues as well.",

Other studies have shown CTL responses in GI mucosal tissues of chronically SIVmac-infected NHPs, which contained levels of CTLs comparable to those found in the peripheral blood and lymph nodes (Schmitz et al., 2001). Finally, while high CTL responses develop at a similar rate and magnitude in both peripheral and mucosal lymphoid tissues in primary SIV infection, mucosal CTL responses may predominate later in the course of the disease (Veazey et al., 2003).",

Mature Th1 cells produce IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and lymphotoxin-\u03b1 (LT-\u03b1, also known as TNF-\u03b2), LT-\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 (Mosmann and Coffman, 1989) and mediate Th1-type responses that are associated with CMI and the IgG2a antibody subclass in the mouse system (Snapper and Paul, 1987). On the other hand, IL-4 promotes differentiation of Th2 cells that produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13 (Mosmann and Coffman, 1989) and provide effective help for IgG1, IgG2b, and IgE antibody responses (Coffman et al., 1988; Finkelman et al., 1990; Esser and Radbruch, 1990). Both Th1 and Th2 cells are quite sensitive to cross-regulation. Thus, IFN-\u03b3 inhibits both Th2 cell proliferation and B-cell isotype switching stimulated by IL-4 (Gajewski and Fitch, 1988). Likewise, IL-10 inhibits IFN-\u03b3 secretion by Th1 cells, allowing the development of Th2-type cells. Further, the Th2 cell subset is an effective helper phenotype for supporting the IgA isotype in addition to IgG1, IgG2b, and IgE responses in the mouse system.",

Thus, IL-10 has also been shown to play an important role in the induction of IgA synthesis, especially in humans (Briere et al., 1994; Defrance et al., 1992). Finally, high frequencies of Th2 cells producing IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 were shown in mucosal effector sites (e.g., the intestinal lamina propria and the salivary glands) where IgA responses occur (Mega et al., 1992; Taguchi et al., 1990). More recent studies with a number of mucosal adjuvants and vaccine delivery systems have now shown that Th1-type cytokines are also important for mucosal S-IgA (Van Cott et al., 1996; Marinaro et al., 1997; Arulanandam et al., 1999; Boyaka et al., 1999). This finding underlines the importance of S-IgA for protection of host mucosal surfaces against both soluble toxins and allergens as well as intracellular pathogens that require complement-fixing antibodies and CMI.",

It has also been shown that mouse Th1 cells but not Th2 cells express CCR7 (Randolph et al., 1999). Interestingly, only CCR7-Th2 cells localize in the periphery of the T-cell zones, from where they can provide help to nearby B cells in B-cell follicles (Randolph et al., 1999). To what extent such dichotomy between localization of Th1 and Th2 cells occurs in mucosal inductive and effector tissues remains to be determined.",

            "text": "The major enterotoxins produced by Vibrio cholerae and Escherichia coli, CT and LT, respectively, have continued to be the most studied mucosal adjuvants (see Chapter 54) and account for nearly 40% of all the publications on mucosal vaccines during the last 5 years (Figure 47.1). The B subunits of these molecules bind to cell surface gangliosides and thus could target vaccines to mucosal epithelial cells. CT and LT could also enhance immune responses by increasing the permeability of epithelial membranes. Studies in the 1980s and early 1990s showed the role of CT for B-cell switching and S-IgA antibody production. It has also become clear over the past few years that mucosal adjuvants play a major role in the differentiation of CD4+ T cells and subsequent Th1- or Th2-type responses for protection against intracellular pathogens or toxins. In this regard, the mucosal adjuvant activity of CT after oral immunization of mice with protein antigen and CT as adjuvant involves IL-4 and Th2-type responses (Xu-Amano et al., 1993; Marinaro et al., 1995; Vajdy et al., 1995). On the other hand, oral immunization with LT resulted in mixed CD4+ Th1- and Th2-type responses that included IFN-\u03b3, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 production (Takahashi et al., 1996). Studies with chimeras of CT and LT have shown that the nature of the subunits of these enterotoxins, but not the ADP ribosyltransferase activity, direct the type of CD4+ T-cell responses (Bowman and Clements, 2001; Kweon et al., 2002; Boyaka et al., 2003). It has now been established that enterotoxins upregulate costimulatory and MHC class II molecule expression by M\u00d8 and DCs and thus favor their interaction with effector B and T cells (Cong et al., 1997; Yamamoto et al., 1999; Gagliardi et al., 2000). Further, CT induces IL-1 secretion by APCs, and this cytokine has now been shown to promote mucosal immunity by mechanisms resembling those mediated by CT (Staats et al., 1999). The mutants of CT and LT (mCTs and mLTs) generated by amino acid substitution are generally poor adjuvants when given by the oral route (see Chapter 54). Since safety issues are associated with the use of enterotoxins as nasal adjuvants (see next section), the next important challenge for mucosal vaccinologists will be to devise enzymatically inactive mCTs and mLTs capable of acting as mucosal adjuvant for oral vaccines.",

            "text": "It is now clear that stimulation via pattern recognition such as TLRs favor the development of mucosal immunity. Bacterial but not eukaryotic DNA contain immunostimulatory sequences consisting of short palindromic nucleotides centered around a CpG dinucleotide core, e.g., 5\u2032-purine-purine-CG-pyrimidine-pyrimidine-3\u2032 or CpG motifs (Krieg, 2002; see Chapter 53). It is now clear that CpG motifs can induce B-cell proliferation and Ig synthesis as well as secretion of cytokines (i.e., IL-6, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, and IL-18) by a variety of immune cells (Tighe et al., 1998). Since CpG motifs create a cytokine microenvironment favoring Th1-type responses, they can be used as adjuvants to stimulate antigen-specific Th1-type responses or to redirect harmful allergic or Th2-dominated autoimmune responses. Indeed, coinjection of bacterial DNA or CpG motifs with a DNA vaccine or with a protein antigen promotes Th1-type responses even in mice with a pre-existing Th2-type of immunity (Roman et al., 1997; Klinman et al., 1996). More important for this chapter, CpG motifs can enhance systemic as well as mucosal immune responses when given to mice by the nasal route (McCluskie and Davis, 1998; Moldoveanu et al., 1998; Gallichan et al., 2001) or oral route (McCluskie et al., 2000). A recent study provided evidence that CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) could also induce innate immune protection of the female genital tract (Harandi et al., 2003). In fact, vaginal administration of CpG ODNs rapidly induced IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, IL-18, and RANTES production in the genital tract mucosa (Harandi et al., 2003). The vaginal CpG ODN treatment protected mice against vaginal challenge with otherwise lethal doses of herpes simplex virus type 2, demonstrating the induction of innate immunity (Harandi et al., 2003). It is interesting that two of the innate molecules induced by CpG (i.e., IL-12 and RANTES) were reported to bridge the mucosal innate with the adaptive immune system (see next section).",

Moreover, Zot as adjuvant induced antigen-specific IgG subclasses that consisted of IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibodies and resembled the pattern induced by LT (Marinaro et al., 1999). Zot was recently shown to also act as adjuvant for rectal immunization (Marinaro et al., 2003).

            "text": "\nConsistent with the fact that CT induces IL-1 secretion by APCs and epithelial cells (Bromander et al., 1991, 1993), IL-1 has been shown to enhance mucosal immune responses to coadministered antigens and to promote a pattern of plasma IgG subclasses similar to the Th2-type response inducer CT (Staats et al., 1999). Both CMI and CTL responses could also be induced when IL-1 was nasally administered in combination with the Th1-type inducing cytokines IL-12, IL-18, or IL-12 plus GM-CSF (Bradney et al., 2002). CT has also been shown to induce IL-6 secretion by epithelial cells (McGee et al., 1993). However, in contrast to IL-1, nasal delivery of IL-6 together with a protein antigen promoted antigen-specific systemic immunity but failed to induce mucosal S-IgA antibody responses (Boyaka et al., 1999). Thus, not all cytokines induced by CT can provide signals for mucosal S-IgA antibody responses. IL-12 is a major cytokine produced by APCs in response to a variety of stimuli. This cytokine has been shown to induce antibodies to nasally coadministered protein vaccines in both the systemic compartment and mucosal tissues (Aralandandam et al., 1999; Boyaka et al., 1999) via mechanisms involving CD4+ Th1 cells (Boyaka et al., 1999). In addition, nasal (Marinaro et al., 1999b; Belyakov et al., 2000) or oral (Marinaro et al., 1999b) coadministration of IL-12 and CT redirected CT-induced Th2-type responses toward a Th1-type and optimized the induction of CTLs by a mucosal HIV peptide vaccine (Belyakov et al., 2000). A single intratracheal dose of Flt3 L was recently reported to increase the number of DCs and T cells in rat lung tissues and to enhance mucosal antibody responses to a protein antigen delivered thereafter (Pabst et al., 2003). Along the same line, nasal coadministration of a protein antigen and a plasmid DNA expressing Flt3 L (pFlt3 L) promoted antigen-specific mucosal and systemic antibody responses (Kataoka et al., 2004). Interestingly, unlike CpG ODNs, which stimulate Th1-type responses, pFlt3 L promoted Th2-type responses (Kataoka et al., 2004).",

Lymphotactin (Lptn) is a C chemokine produced predominantly by NK and CD8+ T cells, including \u03b3\u03b4 TCR+ IELs. Nasal coadministration of Lptn and a protein antigen enhanced antigen-specific antibody responses both in blood plasma and in mucosal secretions (Lillard et al., 1999). Lptn as adjuvant induced antigen-specific CD4+ Th1- and Th2-type cells and IgG1>IgG2a=IgG2b=IgG3 antibody subclasses (Lillard et al., 1999). Another CC chemokine, RANTES, also displayed mucosal adjuvant activity for nasally coadministered protein antigen (Lillard et al., 2001). RANTES as adjuvant promoted antigen-specific CD4+ Th1-type cytokine responses and supported Th1-associated plasma IgG subclass responses (Lillard et al., 2001). As was discussed for CT and LT above, similar chemokines may have different effects on mucosal antibody and CMI responses. For example, MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2 are distinct but highly homologous CC chemokines that share affinity for CCR5. MIP-1\u03b1 also binds CCR1 as well as CCR3 in the mouse, while MIP-1\u03b2 is a ligand for CCR8. A recent study has shown that nasally delivered MIP-1\u03b1 promotes strong plasma IgG antibodies as well as mucosal and systemic CMI responses to coadministered antigen (Lillard et al., 2003). On the other hand, MIP-1\u03b2 was a less effective adjuvant for plasma IgG antibodies and failed to induce CMI responses. However, MIP-1\u03b2 supported higher levels of mucosal S-IgA antibodies (Lillard et al., 2003).",

This molecule promotes both humoral and CMI responses when added to systemic vaccine formulations and has now been tested in several parenteral vaccine formulations (Livingston et al., 1997; Kensil and Kramer, 1998). QS-21 was reported to promote both systemic and mucosal immunity to a nasal DNA vaccine (Sasaki et al., 1998). Others have shown that QS-21 also acts as adjuvant when given to mice by the oral route (Boyaka et al., 2001).

On the other hand, stronger Th1-type responses were seen after immunization with high oral QS-21 doses (Boyaka et al., 2001). It is possible that the mild detergent activity of QS-21 and related saponin derivatives such as QS-7 (Kensil and Kramer, 1998) may enhance immune responses by facilitating antigen uptake. This point and mechanisms by which saponin derivatives promote mucosal immunity and control CD4+ Th cell subset differentiation remain to be determined.",

            "text": "The ability of some viral outer capsid proteins to bind to M cells covering mucosal inductive sites has recently been exploited to devise a delivery systems protein, DNA, and possibly polysaccharide vaccines (see Chapter 7). In this regard, reoviruses are nonenveloped, double-stranded RNA icosahedral viruses composed of three serotypes (Schiff and Fields, 1990). The most widely studied serotypes, 1 and 3, enter the host via M cells in the FAE. Binding to M cells is mediated via the C-terminus of the minor outer capsid protein sigma one (p\u03c31) (Mah et al., 1990). The p\u03c31 subunit is 45 kDa and polymerizes via its N-terminus to form a stable tetramer (Bassel-Duby et al., 1987). Incorporation of p\u03c31 into liposomes was shown to allow their binding to mouse L cells and rat Peyer's patches (Rubas et al., 1990). Likewise, the p\u03c31 can bind to NALT M cells (Wu et al., 2000, 2001). Of major interest for mucosal vaccine development, immunization with DNA complexed to p\u03c31 could overcome the low immunogenicity of naked DNA and promote elevated S-IgA and plasma IgG antibody responses (Wu et al., 2001). Protein and polysaccharide vaccine antigens could be linked to p\u03c31 for optimal targeting of M cells and mucosal inductive sites. However, extrapolation of this strategy for human vaccination will first require that we determine the serotype of reovirus with the best affinity for human M cells.",

In June 2003, a cold-adapted live influenza vaccine (i.e., FluMist) was approved as a nasal vaccine for humans (Table 47.1). Despite these significant advances, further studies will be required to determine optimal mucosal immunization protocols and to enhance the expression of future live recombinant vaccines while diminishing responses to the vector to prevent its elimination by immune mechanisms. In fact, vectored delivery has been limited to former pathogens that have been subjected to attenuating mutations or genomic deletions.

Less appreciated is the fact that delivery systems and/or adjuvants are also needed to enhance mucosal tolerance for effective immunotherapeutic applications. Thus far, the most promising vehicle for inducing mucosal tolerance is CT-B. Thus, mucosal delivery of CT-B chemically linked or genetically fused to various autoantigens is generally a more effective method for inducing tolerance than mucosal administration of autoantigen alone. For example, oral or nasal treatment with low-dose CT-B chemically conjugated or genetically linked (fusion proteins) to myelin basic protein (Sun et al., 2000), insulin (Bergerot et al., 1997), or collagen II (Tarkowski et al., 1999) and/or selected peptides derived from these antigens could totally or markedly suppress the development of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), type I diabetes, or collagen-induced arthritis, respectively. In addition, prolonged oral treatment with low doses of allergen conjugated to CT-B markedly suppressed IgE antibody responses and allergic reactions in sensitized mice (Rask et al., 2000). More recently, mucosally induced uveitis could be prevented in rat by oral administration of CT-B linked with the uveitogenic peptide (aa 336\u2013351) derived from human heat-shock protein (HSP) 60 (Phipps et al., 2003).",

While reviewing the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of oral rhesus\u2013human reassortant vaccine candidates, a Rotavirus Working Group of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) noted 5 cases of intussusception among 10,054 vaccinees, 3 of which occurred during the first week postvaccination, and 1 case among 4,633 placebo recipients (Margaret et al., 2000). While none of these cases had been judged by the clinical study investigators to be directly attributable to the vaccine, the product was withdrawn from the market. Thus, better methods are needed to analyze and predict potential toxicity of oral vaccines.",

            "text": "The nasal cavity is anatomically close to the olfactory nerves/epithelium (ON/E) and olfactory bulbs (OBs). Recent studies examined whether, in addition to NALT, CT as adjuvant could target these tissues of the central nervous system. Both CT and its B subunit (CT-B) entered the ON/E and OB and persisted for 6 days, although neither molecule was present in NALT beyond 24 hours after nasal delivery (van Ginkel et al., 1999). This uptake into olfactory regions was monosialoganglioside (GM1)-dependent. Nasal vaccination with 125I-TT together with unlabeled CT as adjuvant resulted in uptake into the ON/E but not the OB, whereas 125I-TT alone did not penetrate into the CNS. This study suggested that GM1-binding molecules like CT target the ON/E and are retrograde-transported into the OB and may promote uptake of vaccine proteins into olfactory neurons. This raises concerns about the role of GM1-binding molecules that target neuronal tissues in mucosal immunity (van Ginkel et al., 1999). The targeting of CNS tissues by nasally administered bacterial enterotoxins is possibly related to a higher incidence of Bell's palsy (facial paresis) among volunteers of a nasal vaccination trial with native LT as mucosal adjuvant. Thus, of the serious adverse events reported for approximately 3,600 subjects participating in a clinical (safety) trial for a nonliving nasal flu vaccine (Nasalflu) in 2000, there were 9 cases of Bell's palsy and 1 of trigeminal neuralgia that developed into facial paresis. Furthermore, five cases of Bell's palsy were spontaneously reported from among approximately 90,000 recipients of Nasalflu, and the vaccine was withdrawn from the market (www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/enteric/intranasal.htm; Table 47.1). The recent approval of the trivalent FluMist cold-adapted live influenza vaccine demonstrates that the nasal route remains a viable choice for delivery of carefully devised mucosal vaccines.",

            "text": "Like HIV and AIDS some 20 years ago, the recent worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) dramatically reminded us that infectious diseases remain a major global threat that is no longer restricted to developing countries or selected populations. The newly discovered coronavirus responsible for SARS (Kuiken et al., 2003) infects the host via mucosal tissues of the respiratory tract, where both mucosal antibodies and CMI responses could provide the host with lifesaving protection. The cases of inhalational anthrax related to a bioterrorism attack in the United States during October and November 2001 (Jernigan et al., 2001; Guarner et al., 2003) further demonstrated the importance of mucosal tissues as portals for entry of pathogenic agents used as bioterrorism agents. In this regard, transmission of all the Category A bioterrorist agents/diseases listed by the CDC occurs by either inhalation or ingestion. Our understanding of mechanisms by which adjuvants control mucosal antibody and CMI responses has greatly improved over the past decade. In fact, we now know that pattern recognitions, together with innate factors such as cytokines and chemokines and the APC function of DCs, are crucial for initiation of mucosal immunity. New and improved delivery systems will be critical for use with new mucosal vaccines such as the nasal FluMist vaccine. The ADP ribosyltransferase activity of bacterial enterotoxins has been the only potential toxicity investigated in mucosal vaccines. The recent knowledge that nasal vaccines can potentially bind to neurons has fostered research on the safety of mucosal vaccines and should help in the design of safer vaccines to be administered by the nasal or other mucosal routes. The recently approved FluMist vaccine could then be the first of a long list of new-generation mucosal vaccines.",
