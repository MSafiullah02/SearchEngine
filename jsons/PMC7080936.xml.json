To combat this threat, society has relied on three main bacterial inactivation methods: (1) Pharmaceutical (ex. antibiotics), (2) chemical (ex. antiseptics and disinfectants) and (3) physical (ex. heat, UV irradiation, cold plasma). Estimates from recent market research analyses indicate that these bacterial decontamination methods are so abundant, they globally comprise multibillion/million-dollar (US) industries at $46 billion (Watson 2019a), $5.5 billion (John 2017) and $149 million (Watson 2019b), respectively. Despite the large financial investments and modern technological advances bacteria continue to evolve and evade inactivation methods. Thus, novel bacterial control methods are urgently required.",

            "text": "One physical technique to inactivate microbes, which has been utilized for 100+ years (Sitzmann et al. 2017), is pulsed electric field(s) (PEF). Processes such as hospital effluent disinfection (Gusbeth et al. 2009), liquid and food pasteurization (Castro et al. 1993; Barbosa-Canovas et al. 2000), biofilm breakdown (Khan and El-Hag 2011; Freebairn et al. 2013) and topical burn antiseptic (Golberg et al. 2014) have found strong utilization for PEF. One of the main advantages for this inactivation process, versus the other available techniques, is the lack of resistance to the inactivation mode of action\u2014membrane charging with subsequent, permanent breakdown of the cell wall (Katsuki et al. 2002; Dermol and Miklav\u010di\u010d 2017), also known as irreversible electroporation. However, the main disadvantage of this technology has been the large thermal gradient that is generated by the long (\u00b5s to > 1 s) pulses utilized, drastically restricting the use of this technology to heat-tolerant products. However, newly engineered nanosecond pulse generators, which create a significantly reduced thermal gradient, are now commercially available and have the potential to expand the PEF technology as a bacterial decontamination technique for heat-sensitive applications and products. This type of technology may prove especially useful for in vivo medical applications in which the subsequent heating of the surrounding tissue would be deleterious, as well as industrial food processing applications which require lower heat thresholds to maintain the sensory and physical properties of the food product (Barbosa-Canovas et al. 2000).",

We evaluated the impact of increasing the applied amplitude and pulse number to establish a range of inactivation thresholds at various exposure parameters. Given the effectiveness of nsPEF to inactivate bacteria, we hypothesized that the electroporated bacterial cells would be more sensitive to various antibiotics. To test this hypothesis, we exposed the treated cells to antibiotic-soaked discs and measured subsequent zones of growth inhibition. Furthermore, we measured the thermal gradient produced by each exposure and independently applied that thermal equivalent (TE) to both the inactivation and antibiotic susceptibility experiments. These results would validate that the observed inactivation and increase in antibiotic susceptibility was not based on thermal loading of the samples. We postulate that as a non-pharmaceutical, non-chemical, non-ionizing, and E-field driven technology, nsPEF has the potential to singularly or synergistically affect antibiotic treatment therapies, most especially antibiotic-resistant superbugs.",

A high-voltage probe (#P6015A Tektronix, Beaverton, OR, USA) connected to a high-speed oscilloscope (#TDS 30504B Tektronix, Beaverton, OR, USA) was used to measure the delivered pulse. For all exposures except 1000 pulses, the applied voltage from the high-voltage power supply was set at a fixed voltage to achieve the desired mean E-field amplitude in the cuvette (13.5 \u00b1 0.6, 18.5 \u00b1 2.5 and 23.5 \u00b1 2.3 kV cm\u22121). For the 1000 pulse exposures, a rise in the temperature decreased the impedance of the cuvette resulting in a lower applied field. To maintain the mean exposure amplitude, the applied voltage was manually adjusted periodically. While this adjustment is not ideal, it ensured a more uniform E-field exposure, but likely contributed to some of the sample variability observed for 1000 pulse exposures. COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae software v. 4.3b (COMSOL) was used to model E-field distribution within the exposure cuvette. The predicted E-field distribution displays uniformity throughout the exposure solution (Fig. 1c) thus the E-field is assumed to be spatially uniform throughout cellular exposures.",

First, several studies have suggested that cell size and shape play a critical role in transmembrane potential charging and subsequent membrane pore formation (Kandu\u0161er and Miklav\u010di\u010d 2008; Khan and El-Hag 2011). Thus, to reduce effects resulting from differences in size and shape we chose two morphologically similar species; both species are rod shaped with similar size dimensions (Hardy Diagnostics 1996\u20132016; Reshes et al. 2008). Second, as we wanted to compare the effects of two physiologically different species (Gram negative and Gram positive), we chose the Gram-positive L. acidophilus, as it is generally considered to be apathogenic and moreover a probiotic. Furthermore, to our knowledge, we are the first group to report nsPEF inactivation results for L. acidophilus. Comparing the species examined here is important for potential applications where nsPEF exposures could be utilized to selectively target a bacterial species. For example, in vivo medical applications where a mixed population of pathogens and non-pathogens exist or in situ for food sterilization/liquid pasteurization purposes.",

This range of exposure conditions allowed us to determine parameter combinations that could be used to selectively target each species respectively. Furthermore, as studies have suggested that parameters of the exposure solution (ex. pH, conductivity) are equally important as cell type to electropermeabilization metrics (Kotnik et al. 1997; Stoodley et al. 1997), we chose to remove the cells from their respective growth media and re-suspend each cell type into a saline exposure solution; thus limiting potential differences based on differences in media composition. Our results show that, in general, L. acidophilus was more susceptible to the 600-ns PEF than E. coli; mean nsPEF LC50 values were higher for E. coli (Fig. 3d, blue) than L. acidophilus (Fig. 4d, blue) for both the 18.5 and 23.5 kV cm\u22121 exposures. However, this was not the case for the 13.5 kV cm\u22121 nsPEF exposures, suggesting that there may be an E-field threshold for inactivation of L. acidophilus.",

            "text": "These results were intriguing to us as many historical studies have suggested that based on differences in the electrical properties of the peptidoglycan layer for Gram-negative and Gram-positive species, a Gram-negative bacterium should be more susceptible to the effects of PEF (H\u00fclsheger et al. 1983). However, a review of more recent PEF studies has proposed that this may not always be the case. For instance, Garc\u00eda et al. (2005) examined the viability of various bacterial species to PEF treatments in an exposure medium with a pH of 4 or 7. Their results suggested that the same cell type will display inactivation differentially based on the pH of the exposure media (Garc\u00eda et al. 2005). While the emphasis of this manuscript was on the effects of the E-field and temperature, we also examined the effect that the 600-ns PEF would have on the pH of the unbuffered NaCl exposure media. Utilizing the largest amplitude of 23.5 kV cm\u22121 we measured the final pH from all pulse numbers utilized, as this would display the most extreme pH changes. We observed the pH increase as the pulse number increased: 6.0 (sham), 6.3 (1 pulse), 6.5 (5 pulses), 6.8 (10 pulses), 7.9 (100 pulses) and 8.9 (1000 pulses). It is important to note that these pH changes are attributed to electrochemistry within the cuvette related to the aluminum electrodes and therefore would scale with amplitude. Therefore, the pH measurements included in this paper represent the worst-case scenario for the bacteria and would be significantly less for the other two lower amplitudes. However, for exposures at an amplitude of 23.5 kV cm\u22121 and pulses \u2264 10, the cumulative change in pH is rather modest, therefore the observed impact on cells would likely be independent of pH. For the 100 and 1000 pulse exposures, the pH change is significant. Although, it is important to note that this pH is achieved over the course of the pulse application and the bacteria only experience the extreme pH for a short duration between end of exposure and analysis. This is in contrast to Garc\u00eda et al. (2005), where the bacteria are placed into a buffer already adjusted to a set pH level. Furthermore, for 1000 pulse exposures, where the pH shows its largest increase, temperature also increases making isolation of nsPEF-specific effects on the cells difficult. This is a topic that we would like to further investigate in future studies.",

(2011) in which molecular dynamic simulations of electroporation of the Gram-negative E. coli outer membrane and the Gram-positive S. aureus membrane were conducted (Piggot et al. 2011). In these simulations, the E. coli outer membrane was more resistant to poration than the S. aureus membrane; the higher resistance was attributed to reduced mobility of the lipopolysaccharide molecules such that the phospholipids were required to fill the water-filled pore resulting in lipid flip-flop (Piggot et al. 2011). The results from that simulation study suggest that other Gram-positive species, such as L. acidophilus, may be susceptible to electroporation and subsequent inactivation more easily than E. coli. Nevertheless, our results indicate that under these exposure conditions it was ultimately the total energy delivered (amplitude, pulse number and pulse duration) that determined the extent of cell inactivation for an individual species.",

            "text": "Although nsPEF technology is largely considered to be E-field driven, during treatment there is an energy-dependent increase in process temperature due to electric current flow and individual product resistance (Schottroff et al. 2018); thus, additional inactivation effects due to heating should be considered. Consequently, for temperature-sensitive applications, it was important to differentiate inactivation triggered by the E-field from the thermal gradient. Additionally, beneficial compounds (e.g. antimicrobial agents, nutrients, etc.) found within target materials and their physical properties may also be affected by temperature gradients induced by extreme PEF exposures. Although the greatest extent of cell inactivation was achieved by 1000 pulses at 18.5 and 23.5 kV cm\u22121; for temperature-sensitive applications, we postulate that the more suitable exposures would be \u2264 100 pulses. At these pulse numbers a significant amount of cell inactivation was obtained by the nsPEF exposure while the thermal gradient and subsequent TE inactivation was negligible. Furthermore, the 13.5 kV cm\u22121 amplitude produced a greater inactivation difference between E. coli and L. acidophilus, while greatly restricting the thermal gradient, at 100 and 1000 pulses. These parameters might be especially useful to target one cell type over the other. However, an important item to note from this study is that the results from the TE exposures reflect a more severe result than what the nsPEF exposed cells actually experienced. This difference can mainly be attributed to the manner by which the nsPEF or TE cells were delivered heat. For instance, during the nsPEF exposures a 1 Hz repetition rate was directly correlated to exposure time (i.e. it took 5 s to deliver 5 pulses). However, for the TE exposures, there was a rate differential by which the thermocycler would adjust temperature gradients between \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d temperatures. For example, exposures which were set to a higher temperature (ex. 100 or 1000 pulses) were heated more quickly than samples that were set to a lower temperature (ex. 1, 5, or 10 pulses). Therefore, to maintain consistency throughout the experiment, the exposure time (equivalent to 1 Hz) was only initiated after a final temperature was achieved. This resulted in a longer total exposure time for the TE exposures as compared to the nsPEF exposures. Interestingly, although the TE LC50 values show slight variation at the different amplitudes between E. coli (Fig. 3d, red) and L. acidophilus (Fig. 4d, red), a similar trend can be observed in which the low amplitude exposures (13.5 kV cm\u22121) require more pulses to kill 50% of the population. However, once a heat threshold was met by pulse number the applied amplitude (18.5 vs. 23.5 kV cm\u22121) became irrelevant.",

            "text": "Lastly, as there is an urgent need for novel techniques to combat antibiotic resistant microbes (CDC 2019), we investigated the possible synergistic effects that nsPEF or the TE exposures could have on antibiotic susceptibilities. To examine this, we exposed both the nsPEF and TE exposed cells to four classes (aminoglycoside, tetracycline, glycopeptide and \u03b2-lactams) of antibiotic soaked disks and allowed the bacteria to grow overnight as the antibiotic diffused throughout the media. Results in Table 1 show that multiple nsPEF exposures can enhance the susceptibility of antibiotics for both E. coli and L. acidophilus, indicative by increased zones of growth inhibition. We also display results for antibiotics that, for E. coli, originated as susceptible but displayed increased zones of inhibition for select nsPEF exposures (Additional file 1: Table S1). Although there were some minor increases in the zones of inhibition for the TE exposures, none of these treatments were significant enough to provide a change in susceptibility, indicating that the change in antibiotic susceptibility was due to the effects of the E-field and not to any induced heating. Although the different classes of antibiotics work on various cellular targets to inactivate bacteria (Li et al. 2015; Kapoor et al. 2017), the first step in the mechanism of action for all antibiotics is to traverse the cell membrane and enter the cytoplasm (James et al. 2009; Krause et al. 2016). Research conducted by Pillet et al. (2016) showed scanning electron, transmission electron and atomic force microscopy results demonstrating the morphological, mechanical and physical damage to the cell wall of Bacillus pumilus from various strengths of \u00b5s electric pulses (Pillet et al. 2016). These results strongly support the theory that PEF directly impact bacterial cell wall integrity. Therefore, we would conclude that damage to the integrity of the cell wall and nsPEF-induced poration of the membrane is reducing or removing this first step allowing for the translocation of the antibiotic to be easier, faster and thus more effective. However, these results were limited to testing the bacterial susceptibility to various antibiotics only after the nsPEF exposure was delivered. It is likely that the addition of antibiotics to the pulsing medium could have increased the efficiency of cell death, but it would have also introduced the possibility of direct electrotransfer of the antibiotic into the cell, which was intentionally avoided in this study. Future research should evaluate if electrotransfer of antibiotics during nsPEF exposure increases the level of death across the various bacterial species.",
