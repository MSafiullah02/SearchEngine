In addition, tecovirimat has demonstrated significant antiviral activity in various animal models of the poxvirus disease, including the complete protection of golden\u2010mantled ground squirrels from lethal doses of monkeypox virus and protection of nonhuman primates from variola virus in lesional disease models.12 The agent demonstrated favorable safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in a double\u2010blind, randomized, placebo\u2010controlled phase I ascending\u2010dose study in healthy human volunteers. These and other results support the use of tecovirimat to prevent smallpox disease in nonvaccinated individuals, as a postexposure therapeutic for use in nonsymptomatic individuals exposed to variola virus, as a treatment for confirmed smallpox infection, and as an adjuvant to vaccination with the smallpox vaccine.13 Recently, it has received both orphan drug designation and fast\u2010track status from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), supporting development of tecovirimat for the prevention and treatment of smallpox infections.14\n",
