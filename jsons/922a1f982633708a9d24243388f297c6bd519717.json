While Gay City has a long-standing telePrEP component [8] , other programs have had to quickly convert many services traditionally provided in person to telemedicine or telephone modalities. Converting some services to telemedicine may have a significant negative impact on the priority populations severed by the Seattle programs. A recent analysis of Max patient values identified that positive interactions with program staff-sometimes considered by patients to be like family-and the provision of care in real time (via walk-in visits) were critical components of the Max program that allowed patients to successfully engage in HIV care [10] . The strong push to convert patient visits from in-person to telemedicine during COVID-19 could undermine strategies used by these programs to reach priority populations and retain them in care [6] . Shifting family-like clinic service provision to one in which connections are strained by digital or telephone technology might also lead to broken trust and trigger feelings of abandonment among patients served by these programs.",

One caveat in terms of continuing face-to-face service is, of course, the risk for program staff on the front lines. This is especially important to consider in programs in which many volunteers and sometimes staff members are peers or paraprofessionals (e.g., Gay City). These individuals may not have the benefit of training and experience in infection control. Moreover, they may have health concerns of their own, including compromised immune systems.

Maintenance of counseling options around sexual behavior and PrEP adherence, including sex-positive messaging describing alternatives to maintain sexual health (e.g., video chats or phone sex), remain critical for HIV prevention during social distancing.

To keep HIV and STI services available to clients in need, while maintaining the safety of clients and staff, these programs have implemented a number of new testing strategies. These include phone screening clients for COVID-19 symptoms before they come to testing locations, syndromic management of STI symptoms by phone, and home-based self-testing for HIV and STIs under supervision of program staff. Other strategies include minimizing hours of operation at particular testing locations where social distancing practices are difficult to achieve (e.g., bathhouses) or avoiding testing at these locations all together. Additionally, programs have found ways to reduce the overall testing burden by waving HIV and STI testing for stable clients seeking PrEP refilling and holding screening for non-urgent medical conditions (e.g., cancer). Holding testing or screening for non-urgent medical conditions, however, is likely to negatively impact PLWH who disproportionately experience co-morbid infections [12] .",

Although current CDC guidelines recommend prescribing no more than 90 days of PrEP [13] , even prior to COVID-19, there was discussion about whether recommended PrEP monitoring is excessive and whether some PrEP clients can have longer intervals between testing, particularly for long-standing clients who report excellent PrEP adherence.",

During this pandemic, as well as any other future socially disrupting events, it is important to recognize that adaptations in service delivery that are acceptable solutions for some populations may further harm already disadvantaged populations. Seattle programs have ensured that adapted HIV services are providing continued access to non-stigmatizing care for priority populations from trusted service programs during COVID-19.
