Both T cells and B cells are equipped with specific antigen recognition receptors, the former with the T\u2010cell receptor (TCR), while B cells secrete immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules. T cells originate and differentiate in the thymus. Every T cell that leaves the thymus is conferred with a unique specificity for recognizing antigens through its TCR. The TCR consists of two glycosylated polypeptide chains, the alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) chains, which are linked by disulfide bonds. Each chain consists of variable (V), joining (J), and constant (C) regions closely resembling Ig chains. T cells that recognize self\u2010antigens with high affinity are either deleted or rendered tolerant within the thymus, through a process called central tolerance.",

Functionally, CD4+ T cells are involved in delayed\u2010type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses and also provide help for B\u2010cell differentiation, and hence are termed T helper (Th) cells. In contrast, CD8+ T cells are involved in class I\u2010restricted lysis of antigen\u2010specific targets, and hence are termed cytotoxic T cells. The CD4 molecule binds to a nonpolymorphic site on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II \u03b2 chain that is expressed by antigen\u2010presenting cells (APCs). In contrast CD8 binds to the \u03b1\u20103 domain of the MHC class I molecule expressed by most cell types. The MHC molecule serves to present antigen to the T cell via the TCR.",

The CD3 molecule is part of the TCR complex, although the TCR interacts with the MHC\u2013peptide complex on APCs, signals for the subsequent enactment of T\u2010cell activation and proliferation are delivered by the CD3 antigen. The cytoplasmic tail of the CD3 proteins contains one copy of a sequence motif important for signaling functions, called the immunoreceptor tyrosine\u2010based activation motif (ITAM). Phosphorylation of the ITAM initiates intracellular signaling events. The interaction of MHC\u2013peptide complex with T cells, while necessary, is insufficient for T\u2010cell activation. Additional classes of molecules are involved in T\u2010cell antigen recognition, activation, intracellular signaling, adhesion, and trafficking of T cells to their target organs.",

            "text": "Intracellular signaling mechanisms provide the link between the binding of the cytokine with its receptor and the effect of the cytokine on cellular function. The Janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription (Jak/STAT) family of transducer/transcription\u2010activating factors plays a critical role in the signaling of many cytokine receptors. Cytokine binding to the specific receptor activates the Jak molecule associated with the receptor, causing phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, and binding of the Jak molecules to its receptor. This facilitates binding of STAT proteins to the phosphorylated receptor, which subsequently dissociates from the receptor, dimerizes, and activates transcription of genes containing specific cis\u2010regulatory STAT\u2010binding sequences. Different cytokine receptors are associated with different Jak/STAT proteins. The IL\u201012 receptor is associated with Jak\u20102 and STAT3 and STAT4 (Jacobson et al., 1995). The IL\u20104 receptor is associated with Jak\u20101\u20133 and STAT6 (Kaplan 1996, Takeda 1996) (Fig. 1). Mice deficient in STAT6 display a reduction in Th2 cytokine production, decreased IL\u20104\u2010induced B\u2010cell proliferation and reduced IgE (Kaplan 1996, Takeda 1996). In contrast, STAT4 plays a pivotal role in Th1 immune responses. STAT4 is activated after IL\u201012 interacts with the IL\u201012 receptor, inducing transcription of IFN\u2010\u03b3 (Jacobson et al., 1995). Mice deficient in STAT4 lack IL\u201012\u2010induced IFN\u2010\u03b3 production and Th1 differentiation (Kaplan 1996, Thierfelder 1996), and display a predominantly Th2 phenotype (Kaplan et al., 1996).",

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease, and may be induced in several animal types via immunization with myelin proteins or peptides. Disease is primarily mediated by myelin\u2010reactive Th1 cells, which precipitate an inflammatory, demyelinating response within the CNS (Chitnis et al., 2001b). Transfer of myelin basic protein (MBP)\u2010specific T\u2010cell clones restricted to class II (Ia) antigens of the MHC into naive recipient animals causes a similar inflammatory demyelinating disease (Zamvil et al., 1985). EAE reproduces many of the clinical and immunologic aspects of MS, and has been widely used to study the mechanisms of CD4+ T\u2010cell priming and response to myelin components (Bettelli 1998, Chitnis 2001a) as well as to test potential therapies for MS (Aharoni 1999, Yednock 1992).",

Activated myelin\u2010reactive CD4+ T cells are present in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients; in contrast, only nonactivated myelin\u2010reactive T cells are present in the blood of controls (Zhang et al., 1994). Sequences in MBP has been shown to resemble several viral sequences, and in some cases, cross\u2010reactive T\u2010cell responses have been demonstrated. Although no pathogen has definitely been proven to be the cause of MS, it is conceivable that certain pathogens serve as molecular mimics to CNS components or play a role in the activation of myelin\u2010specific CD4+ T cells. Examples of cross\u2010reactive T cells with MBP antigens include human herpesvirus 6 (HHV\u20106) (Tejada\u2010Simon et al., 2003), staphylococcal enterotoxin antigens (Zhang et al., 1995), coronavirus (Talbot et al., 1996), influenza virus hemagglutinin (Markovic\u2010Plese et al., 2005), and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) (Lang et al., 2002). Proteolipid protein (PLP) shares common sequences with Haemophilus influenzae (Olson et al., 2001), while Semliki Forest virus (SFV) peptides mimic epitopes of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) (Mokhtarian et al., 1999).",

Moreover, MS disease\u2010associated MHC class II allele, DRB1*1501 has been shown to be effective in presenting MBP peptide to T\u2010cell clones isolated from MS patients (Wucherpfennig 1995, Wucherpfennig 1997). Activated myelin\u2010reactive CD4+ T cells are present in the blood and CSF of MS patients; in contrast, only nonactivated myelin\u2010reactive T cells are present in the blood of controls (Zhang et al., 1994). Furthermore, MBP\u2010reactive T cells isolated from the CSF of MS patients display increased expression of the IL\u20102 receptor (Zhang et al., 1994), consistent with a previously activated or memory phenotype. In MS patients, but not in healthy controls, these cells can be activated in the absence of CD28\u2010B7 costimulation, thus implying that they have been previously activated in vivo (Markovic\u2010Plese 2001, Scholz 1998). MBP\u2010reactive T cells from MS patients were found to be less responsive to CTLA\u20104 blockade compared to those from healthy controls (Oliveira et al., 2003), signifying that in MS patients these T cells are not subject to the normal regulatory mechanisms. Although the contribution of MBP\u2010reactive T cells to the pathogenesis of MS is currently unknown, their differential phenotype and costimulatory requirements indicate a memory and potentially dysregulated cell population.",

TCR vaccines employing TCR V\u03b2 5.2 peptides are thought to exert their effects by enhancing the function of regulatory T\u2010cell populations recognizing TCR determinants (Vandenbark 2005, Vandenbark 1996), and are currently undergoing pilot studies in MS. Phase II trials using antibodies specifically targeting the V\u03b2 5.2/5.3 sequence of the TCR have shown some success and no significant adverse effects (Killestein 2002, Olsson 2002). However, other groups (Gran 1998, Lozeron 1998, Musette 1996) have found predominant usage of other V\u03b2 chains, indicative of potential limitations with TCR V\u03b2 5.2\u2010targeted therapies. Studies in twins demonstrated similar selection of TCR V\u03b1 chains in concordant twins in response to MBP, when compared to discordant twins or controls, suggesting a genetic basis for the evolution of self\u2010antigen T\u2010cell responses (Utz et al., 1993). MS patients treated with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation demonstrated an increase in naive compared to memory CD4+ T cells, with increased TCR diversity indicative of broader clonal phenotypes 2 years following therapy (Muraro et al., 2005). A separate study ascertained similar findings and found that MBP\u2010reactive T cells demonstrated broader epitope recognition following reconstitution (Sun et al., 2004).",

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and macrophages are also found toward the periphery of the lesion and in the normal appearing white matter (Traugott et al., 1983a). CD4+ T cells were shown to predominate in acute lesions, while CD8+ T cells were observed more frequently in chronic lesions (Raine, 1994). Similar densities of CD3+ T cells have been demonstrated in all four of the histopathologic subtypes of MS, although type III and IV lesions are additionally characterized by prominent oligodendrocyte degeneration (Lucchinetti et al., 1996). Attempts to isolate T\u2010cell clones from the brains of MS patients failed to show either MBP or PLP reactivity (Hafler et al., 1987). TCR analysis from MS lesions demonstrated a broad TCR V\u03b1 and V\u03b2 repertoires in active lesions, while fewer TCR V genes were detected in chronic plaques and control samples (Wucherpfennig et al., 1992). Other studies demonstrated restricted TCR specificities, with rearranged V\u03b2 5.2 genes found in the brains of all patients who were HLA DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602, and DPB1*0401 positive, suggesting that MHC class II genotype may play a role in VDJ rearrangements in MS lesions (Oksenberg et al., 1993). T cells in parenchymal MS lesions lacked CCR7, indicating a differentiation of central\u2010memory T cells into effector memory cells presumably on restimulation by antigen within the CNS (Kivisakk et al., 2004).",

Lesions in the CNS of patients with MS were found to be exclusively associated with the expression of B7\u20101 in perivenular lymphocytes, while B7\u20102 was expressed on macrophages in both MS and in other neurological diseases (Windhagen et al., 1995). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), isolated from MS patients, showed increased expression of B7\u20101 on both CD4+ and CD8+ cell patients with rapidly progressive disease, compared to those with stable disease, or normal controls (Mena and Rohowsky\u2010Kochan, 1999). In a separate study, B7\u20101 expression localized to B cells was found to be increased during MS relapses, and treatment with IFN\u2010\u03b2 1b reduced the number of B7\u20101\u2010expressing B cells but increased the number of B7\u20102 monocytes (Genc et al., 1997).

Expression of CD154 was found to be higher in peripheral blood monocytes isolated from SPMS compared with RRMS or healthy controls (Filion 2003, Jensen 2001), and was reduced by IFN\u2010\u03b2 treatment (Teleshova et al., 2000). PBMCs from SPMS patients produced more IL\u201012 and IFN\u2010\u03b3 when restimulated in vitro, compared with healthy controls (Karni et al., 2002). In summary, these studies indicate that the CD40\u2010CD154 pathway is important for the regulation of Th1 cytokine production in MS. Clinical trials with an anti\u2010CD154 antibody (Biogen) in autoimmune disease such as ITP and lupus were terminated because of the occurrence of thromboembolic events. Another formulation of the antibody (IDEC pharmaceuticals) is under investigation. A phase I clinical trial in MS patients was recently performed with good safety data, and therapeutic effects are currently under investigation.",

Studies using semiquantitative RT\u2010PCR and immunocytochemistry found increased expression of B7\u20101 and IL12p40 in acute MS plaques, compared with samples isolated from inflammatory infarcts (Windhagen et al., 1995). IL\u20106, IFN\u2010\u03b3, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 were expressed by cells located in the perivascular cuffs, suggesting that in acute MS lesions, inflammatory cells are the most important source of these cytokines (Woodroofe and Cuzner, 1993). Expression of TNF\u2010\u03b1 was localized to macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes (Cannella 1995, Hofman 1989, Selmaj 1991) in chronic\u2010active lesions. A separate study found that IL\u20102 was expressed predominantly in association with perivascular inflammatory cells examining acute MS lesions (Hofman et al., 1986). Contrary to the Th1/Th2 paradigm of MS, high levels of IL\u20104 were expressed in both acute and chronic\u2010active MS lesions with no obvious correlation to the resolution of the lesion (Cannella and Raine, 1995b). Studies using RNA microarrays in MS brains at autopsy found increased transcripts of genes encoding for IL\u20106, IL\u201017, and IFN\u2010\u03b3 (Lock et al., 2002), indicating a potential role for both Th1 and Th17 cells in proinflammatory responses in MS.",

Clinical attacks correlated with increased IFN\u2010\u03b3 production in vitro (Beck et al., 1988). In a similar study, IFN\u2010\u03b2was found to blunt increased production of IFN\u2010\u03b3 during relapse (Becher et al., 1999). TCR\u2010mediated IFN\u2010\u03b3 and IL\u201010 secretions are increased in relapsing\u2010remitting (RR) and secondary progressive (SP) patients, but not in primary progressive disease, suggesting a dysregulation of this signaling pathway in certain MS subtypes (Balashov et al., 2000). Interestingly, SPMS patients also exhibit seasonal variations of IFN\u2010\u03b3 production with increased expression in autumn and winter months compared with spring and summer months, which was not observed in normal controls (Balashov et al., 1998). A progressive course of MS was found to be significantly more frequent in carriers of the IFN\u2010\u03b3 receptor\u20102 allele Arg64 (Schrijver et al., 2004). Administration of IFN\u2010\u03b3 to MS patients precipitated clinical attacks, confirming the role of IFN\u2010\u03b3 as a proinflammatory cytokine in MS (Panitch 1987a, Panitch 1987b).",

The presence of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, in the MS lesion correlates with axonal damage (Bitsch et al., 2000). In the TMEV model of MS, demyelination but no axonal damage was found in the CNS of MHC class I\u2010deficient mice after infection with Theiler's virus (Rivera\u2010Quinones et al., 1998), suggesting that axonal damage is class I mediated. These mice also displayed a deficiency of CD8\u2010positive cells in their CNS lesions. Similarly, in vitro, T cell\u2010mediated neurotoxicity was dependent on IFN\u2010\u03b3\u2010induced expression of MHC class I (Medana et al., 2001).

            "text": "Although MBP\u2010reactive T cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MS (Zhang 1992, Zhang 1994), an intriguing study has shown that passive transfer of MBP\u2010reactive T cells resulted in protection of the retinal ganglion cell body after optic nerve crush injury in vivo (Moalem et al., 1999). Interestingly, transfer of T cells specific for other antigens was not protective. Furthermore, expression of mRNA for several nerve growth factors, including brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), was upregulated after antigen\u2010activation of these T cells, while the injured nerve expressed mRNA for nerve growth factor receptors (Moalem et al., 2000). Two major types of Th cell responses have been described, based on cytokine secretion. Th1 cells produce the cytokines IFN\u2010\u03b3 and TNF\u2010\u03b1, while Th2 cells produce IL\u20104, IL\u20105, and IL\u201010. EAE has been associated with a Th1 response, while Th2 cytokines are generally protective. In support of the above findings, a separate study demonstrated that the presence of myelin\u2010reactive Th2 cells conferred neuroprotection in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (Wolf et al., 2002). These findings have several implications for MS. First, myelin\u2010reactive T cells may be neuroprotective under certain conditions including trauma, suggesting that the MS brain may be more susceptible to inflammation\u2010induced damage. Second, the local production of neurotrophic factors by inflammatory cells may be neuroprotective. However, in contrast to these findings, other studies have shown that MBP\u2010TCR transgenic mice sustained more CNS damage and inflammation following traumatic spinal cord injury, compared with wild\u2010type controls (Jones et al., 2002). T\u2010cell infiltrates were localized to areas of demyelination and axonal loss, suggesting that autoreactive T cells can trigger autoimmune demyelination in the setting of trauma under certain circumstances. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of neuroprotective T lymphocytes should be entertained only with caution.",

It is composed of a random sequence of the amino acids glutamic acid, lysine, alanine, and tyrosine present in a specific molar ratio (0.14:0.34:0.43:0.09). Copaxone is administered by daily subcutaneous injection, and in a phase III clinical trial was found to reduce relapse frequency by 29%, as well as decrease the incidence of new gadolinium enhancing lesions on MRI (Ge 2000, Johnson 1995, Johnson 2001). Despite its crude resemblance to MBP, evidence from several studies showing GA stimulates several nonmyelin antigen T\u2010cell lines suggests that GA acts as a \u201cuniversal\u201d or degenerate T\u2010cell antigen (Duda et al., 2000). GA has been shown to inhibit responses to MBP\u2010specific T\u2010cell lines in vitro (Racke et al., 1992), and in vivo treatment with GA induces a hyporesponsiveness to this antigen (Schmied et al., 2003). Interestingly, GA\u2010reactive T\u2010cell lines isolated from both treated patients as well as untreated controls were found to cross\u2010react with a variety of peptides, suggesting degenerate antigenicity. In addition, Th2 cytokine deviation was noted in GA\u2010reactive T\u2010cell lines (Duda et al., 2000). In the EAE model, Th2\u2010producing GA\u2010reactive T cells were shown to accumulate in the CNS and attenuate disease (Aharoni et al., 2000). Thus, the principal mechanism of action of Copaxone may be the induction of Th2 responses, which exert bystander suppression of inflammation within the CNS.",

An initial phase I clinical trial tested four doses of an APL to MBP83\u201399 administered subcutaneously for 4 weeks demonstrated no safety concerns (Bielekova and Martin, 2001).

Three of eight patients developed atypical MS exacerbations, characterized by a high gadolinium\u2010enhancing lesion load, tumefactive\u2010type lesion, or a flaccid paralysis with inflammatory involvement of the peripheral nervous system (Bielekova et al., 2000). 2/3 of exacerbations, correlated with enhanced reactivity to MBP (Bielekova et al., 2000).

Pilot trials of T\u2010cell vaccination with autologous MBP\u2010specific T cells from peripheral blood, in 28 RRMS and 26 SPMS patients, demonstrated a modest reduction in posttreatment relapse rate (Medaer 1995, Zhang 2002).

In MS, V\u03b2 5.2/5.3+ has been identified as a dominant TCR variable region sequence involved in MBP T\u2010cell reactivity (Kotzin 1991, Lozeron 1998, Oksenberg 1993). TCR vaccines are thought to exert their effects by enhancing the function of regulatory T\u2010cell populations recognizing TCR determinants (Vandenbark 2005, Vandenbark 1996). TCR peptides derived from the V\u03b2 5.2 region of the TCR have been used as a vaccine in MS patients. In a double\u2010blind pilot study, 23 patients were treated with weekly to monthly injections of the peptide. All patients carried the HLADRB1*1501 allele. Enhanced T\u2010cell responses to the immunizing peptide correlated with clinical improvement (Bourdette 1994, Vandenbark 1996). T\u2010cell responses to MBP trended downward in responders. No major adverse events were observed in treated patients. ATM\u2010027 is an antibody specifically targeting the V\u03b2 5.2/5.3 sequence of TCR. Results from a multicenter phase II study in 47 MS patients treated with a run\u2010in regimen of ATM\u2010027 monthly for 6 months, showed no significant reduction in new gadolinium MRI lesions posttreatment despite a significant reduction in V\u03b2 5.2/5.3+ T cells (Killestein 2002, Olsson 2002). MS relapses occurred in three treated patients, however no other adverse events directly related to drug were observed. These negative results suggest that there is considerable variability in V\u03b2 profiling in individual MS patients. An alternative explanation is that by the time the disease presents clinically, epitope spreading has occurred, negating the use of a single V\u03b2\u2010depleting agent.",

Administration of the antibody resulted in a rapid and sustained reduction in circulating CD4+ T cells. Infusion\u2010related side effects including nausea, fever, and tachycardia were limited to 24\u2010h postinfusion.
