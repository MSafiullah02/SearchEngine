Because of vast investments in clinical research, there has been an exponential increase in cancer information, as more than 400,000 new articles are added to the biomedical literature each year (Davis, Ciurea, Flanagan, & Perrier, 2004). Consumers can readily access cancer information in this e-health environment where the Internet has become the most popular health information source (Baker et al., 2003, Case et al., 2004, Cline and Haynes, 2001, Eng, 2001, Fox, 2006).",

A serious illness or other health condition were among the top personal problems that Americans face in their everyday lives and that brought them to the library (Estabrook, Witt, & Rainie, 2007). Deering and Harris (1996) claimed that over 60% of the participants in their focus group interviews reported the library as their preferred source of health information. In a national random sample survey of library use commissioned by the American Library Association (2006), 12% of the total respondents reported that health-related topics were the first or second most popular reason for using their public library (N\n = 1003). Such a notable usage of libraries was partly explained by their strength as community information centers. Libraries are easily accessible to most citizens, provide free access to various types of information, and provide quality information service from trained reference librarians.",

Such challenges could result in negative consequences, such as uncertainty, information overload, and frustrations, even for individuals who are highly literate (Nielsen-Bohlman et al., 2004, Parker and Kreps, 2005). Thus, libraries could lower the barriers and enhance accessibility to health information by providing more effectively organized information packages and by delivering consumer health information literacy programs (Borman and McKenzie, 2005, Chobot, 2004). In a nutshell, the three enduring and unique roles of the library make it a promising partner in the consumer health information system. The library should be a logical information source, especially for those cancer information seekers who are underserved, seek trustworthy information, or perceive great barriers when seeking information.",

Considering that there are many valuable online cancer resources from authoritative sources, such as the National Library of Medicine, libraries could invest more effort in providing information consumers with useful online resources. For small public libraries that do not have sufficient resources, library communities at large could further their collaborative efforts in building networks of consumer health information services. For example, the National Network of Libraries of Medicine's (NN/LM's) directory of consumer health information is a national database that lists consumer health information services provided by all types of libraries, including public, academic, and hospital libraries (National Network of Libraries of Medicine, 2008). Small public libraries without many cancer resources could make effective referral services utilizing this online directory. These efforts will help libraries develop a reputation as a quality information source among cancer information consumers.",

The perception of greater efforts in seeking information in the library is perhaps related to inadequate consumer health information services in libraries. According to Wood et al. (2000), most public libraries did not set health information services as their primary focus. Some librarians appeared apprehensive about providing health information to their patrons because such a service deals with sensitive issues and risks of intrusion in patron privacy, not to mention responsibility for error with grave health-related consequences for patrons. In a more recent study conducted immediately after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Toronto in 2003, Harris, Wathen, and Chan (2005) reported problems in the readiness of public libraries in providing adequate reference services to health-related inquiries in the midst of the crisis.",

While 61.3% of the Internet group kept their loyalty by choosing the Internet again, only 27.6% of the Library group chose the library. If approximately three in four people in the Library group would not want to make the same choice again, the cancer information services the respondents experienced at the library may not have met their expectations.

However, the other two roles were not associated with library seeking. There was little evidence that people select the library as a quality information source or as a helpful intermediary lowering barriers to their cancer information seeking. To be perceived as a source that actually performs all three anticipated roles claimed in the literature, libraries should invest in further developing their image as a well-packaged, trustworthy consumer health information source and in advancing health information literacy. Librarians should also provide the underserved with more opportunities to encounter trustworthy e-health resources and to get benefits from those emerging resources, with a goal of eliminating the digital health information disparity. Such efforts will help libraries to better shape their niche in the overall consumer health information system.",
