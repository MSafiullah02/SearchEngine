They are as follows:1.ECMO is a limited-resource subject to saturation.2.Some indications for ECMO are better characterized than others, allowing predictions about duration of support and patient outcome. For example, patients on ECMO with influenza A pneumonia and ARDS in 2009 received ECMO and mechanical ventilation for an average of 10 and 25 days, respectively, with acceptable outcomes.7 Although several centers in the United States and abroad have experience with ECMO for patients infected with COVID-19, outcome data are not widely available.3.For other causes of refractory cardiopulmonary failure, the role of ECMO and optimal management are still evolving. This raises several medical and ethical questions regarding resource distribution during crises.4.ECMO requires a substantial investment of resources. It may be necessary to limit ECMO support to patients more likely to survive. These decisions\u2014likely made at the physician or hospital level\u2014ought to be based on a framework determined in advance with input from subject experts, ethics committees, health systems, and the community.5.When demand for ECMO is high and prioritization by indication is necessary, preference should be given to conditions with historically better outcomes and shorter expected duration of support.6.Epidemics may require further prioritization or novel strategies. A process must be in place to integrate public health and clinical expertise to address incident-specific challenges.\n",

Members of this ECMO consortium have maintained regular communication around pandemic preparedness through semiannual meetings. Contact between centers has necessarily kept pace with the rapid spread of COVID-19 infection in our community; we hold biweekly virtual meetings with more frequent operational updates as necessary. We have collaborated on tabletop exercises to simulate just-in-time triage of patients and ECMO equipment. The ECMO consortium developed an online surveillance tool which displays center-specific and aggregate census data for actual ICU, ventilator, and ECMO capacity at the four ECMO centers in our metropolitan area. This allows ECMO physicians and the larger health-care coalition to maintain situational awareness and hold each other accountable should scarce resource allocation become necessary in our region during the dynamic trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

If, during a prolonged incident, demand has outstripped regional resources, the group will plan for incident-specific prognosis, plan for equipment shortages, and evaluate the feasibility of continuing to provide ECMO.

The timing of deployment of this ECMO allocation framework will need to be flexible, incident-specific, and synchronized with the larger regional health-care response, and likely will coincide with the appointment of an ECMO triage officer or team to advise the regional incident command system. Table 1 groups the most common indications for ECMO into three tiers based on expected outcome, with cut points at 30% and 60% approximate survival. These tiers are further divided into short or long expected duration of ECMO support, using a consensus cut point of 5 days. When determining a patient\u2019s eligibility and priority for ECMO during a public health emergency, the regional ECMO triage team\u2014or in its absence, ECMO physicians at the hospital level\u2014will assess the prognosis by ECMO indication, critical illness severity, the anticipated duration of use, and patient age (see e-Appendix 1 for our rationale and five-step method for ECMO allocation). Our consortium adapted this priority scoring system from a construct by White and Lo14 describing the allocation of scarce critical care resources such as ventilators.15 It is consistent with priorities for ECMO use in a consensus guideline concerning COVID-19.16 There is ethical and practical value to a consensus-driven, common regional framework of decision support during the COVID-19 response, without discouraging physicians from considering their local context or patient factors.",

For example, a patient with status asthmaticus and severe hypercarbic respiratory failure (a tier I indication with short anticipated duration of ECMO support per Table 1) has a favorable prognosis with ECMO support, but their prognosis has historically been favorable with mechanical ventilation as well; therefore, in certain cases, the relative benefit of ECMO over conventional support may be small. Many ECMO indications listed in Table 1 lack robust comparative effectiveness data; therefore, this prognostic framework should be viewed as a starting point for resource allocation. Especially during the health-care resource constraints of a global pandemic such as COVID-19, thoughtful patient selection remains vital to maximizing the relative benefit of ECMO for individual patients. An objective prioritization scheme used by an impartial ECMO triage officer should complement, rather than replace, nuanced clinical judgment by a group of experienced physicians at the bedside.",

ECMO centers can leverage response mechanisms maintained by regional health-care coalitions to manage interfacility alerts, notification, and coordination. This allows smooth integration into the incident management system. By including ECMO resources, operational leaders will have a more comprehensive accounting of finite ICU assets. A proactive approach to these events ensures that potentially difficult allocation decisions are as equitable and transparent as possible for the sickest patients.",

The evidence base for ECMO in this pandemic is still evolving, but each step forward strengthens our collective efforts as stewards of finite resources. We encourage other health systems to partner with local disaster management experts to refine our framework and adopt a process for ECMO coordination. Continued integration of these plans into a unified critical care approach to surge capacity will maximize benefit for vulnerable patients with COVID-19 infection during periods of resource scarcity.",
