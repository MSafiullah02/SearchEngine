The CF Centre should have adequate resources (e.g. staffing, IT equipment) and an infrastructure (inpatient and outpatient facilities) that allow the MDT to provide a level of care that is in accordance with the European Cystic Fibrosis Society (ECFS) standards recommended in this document, ensuring a safe, cost-effective and high-quality service. It is recognized that this may not be immediately achievable throughout Europe, particularly in countries with a low gross domestic product. It is crucial that where these standards cannot be met, procedures are put in place to enable them to do so within the short- to mid-term future, and that the hospital management commits to supporting CF clinicians. Without proper resources, a Centre is at risk of providing uncoordinated and substandard care. A lack of homogeneity in CF care will impact on patient outcomes [7].",

Specialists should practice within their professional code of conduct and competency. They have a responsibility to maintain, update and enhance their knowledge, skills, efficacy and expertise through a proactive approach to continuing professional development. Participation in uni- and multi-professional audit and research, benchmarking, external quality assessment schemes, service evaluation, development and improvement, both of the specialist service and its provision as a whole is essential.

A paediatrician/pulmonologist, a physiotherapist and a CF nurse specialist were agreed to be essential team members.

Because of the financial and staffing limitations in Eastern Europe, shared care with local hospitals is not a preferred model of care. Resources should be directed at establishing state-of-the-art CF care at a national level by the development of specialized CF Centres at major hospitals, and where possible at the level of University Hospitals. The minimum staff requirements for a specialist CF team include a physician and a specialist nurse (one each for children and adults in Centres that care for all age groups), and a CF specialist physiotherapist. The goal is to develop teams that include a microbiologist, dietitian, psychologist, social worker and clinical geneticist. Meanwhile the absence of these specialists should not delay the setting up of regional CF Centres. Their roles may be temporarily performed by specialist consultants of the hospital who can be accessed by the CF service, even though not primarily allocated to a CF team and therefore not able, for instance, to participate in regular CF MDT meetings.",
