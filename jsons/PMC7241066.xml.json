Five patients developed pulmonary embolism (PE) during hospitalization, four of them while on prophylactic heparin, and one despite treated with oral anticoagulation with warfarin, since he was carrying a mechanical prosthetic heart valve. Unsurprisingly, prophylactic doses of heparin did not prevent the occurrence of VTE, whereas we were puzzled that the patient with the mechanical heart valve developed PE despite INR values in the therapeutic range, or even above.",

All of them showed an initial increase in inflammatory markers such as C reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and interleukin-6 (IL6), if available, with a subsequent marked increase in d-dimer values followed by the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Our hypothesis, in line with the available literature [2], is that thrombotic events that occur in these patients may be closely related to the inflammatory phase of the disease known as \u201ccytokine storm\u201d and somehow predicted by the rise in inflammatory markers. During this cytokine storm, IL-6 in particular is known to be elevated; we speculate that it could play a role in the pro-coagulative state of COVID-19 patients through its effect on the activation of the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), which indirectly inhibits plasminogen [3]. PAI is a pro-thrombotic factor and it is conceivable that IL-6 and PAI may be one of the links connecting COVID-19 to thrombosis.",

It is known that INR and aPTT reflect the procoagulant arm of the coagulative balance and do not provide information regarding fibrinolytic activity. Under these circumstances, the study of the viscoelastic properties of the clot based on thromboelastography (TEG) might help clinicians to better evaluate the patient\u2019s coagulation status [5]. We suggest that TEG could guide anticoagulant therapy in critically ill patients with COVID-19 and mechanical heart valves, when coagulation times (i.e., INR and aPTT) may prove unreliable.",
