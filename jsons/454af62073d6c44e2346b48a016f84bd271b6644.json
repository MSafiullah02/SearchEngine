In a severe scenario 3.0% will die. The American Hospital Association data show a total of 85 000 adult ICU beds in the US. In the case of only the moderate Covid-19 infection scenario at least 15 million beds would become necessary i.e. 176 times the number now available. This problem will be compounded by the shortage of ventilators, trained respiratory therapists and critical care staff. In addition the lack of widespread diagnostic test kits, effective drugs or vaccines and unavailability of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) also has exacerbated the problems of the US health care system.",

We cannot let a person die from intestinal obstruction by closing operation theatres and wards, as we are now doing, just because we have to prepare to treat a presumed influx of Covid-19 patients. In fact our main criticism of the countrywide 'lockdown' is that we may have more patients who need urgent medical care for other reasons and may be dying without it rather than the number who will be projected to die from a Covid infection. The huge mass migration of the hungry and unemployed poor has been the consequence of trying to prevent a major outbreak of a possible viral epidemic -which might never happen in our unhygienic environment that may have already provided us some herd immunity 5 .",
