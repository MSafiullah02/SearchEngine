The use of vaccines is the main approach to control of the economically important poultry viral respiratory diseases infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) infections and infectious bronchitis (IB). This paper appraises the current methods of vaccine control in the light of the nature of each virus and epidemiological factors associated with each disease. 2. Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) exists as a single type with a wide range of disease severity. It is a serious disease in certain regions of the world. Recent work has distinguished molecular differences between vaccine and field strains and vaccine virus can be a cause of disease. Vaccines have remained unaltered for many years but new ones are being developed to counter vaccine side effects and reversion and reactivation of latent virus. 3. Avian metapneumoviruses, the cause of turkey rhinotracheitis and respiratory disease in chickens exists as 4 subtypes, A, B, C and D. A and B are widespread and vaccines work well provided that accurate doses are given. Newer vaccine developments are designed to eliminate reversion and possibly counter the appearance of newer field strains which may break through established vaccine coverage. 4. IB presents the biggest problem of the three. Being an unstable RNA virus, part of the viral genome that codes for the S1 spike gene can undergo mutation and recombination so that important antigenic variants can appear irregularly which may evade existing vaccine protection. While conventional vaccines work well against homologous types, new strategies are needed to counter this instability. Molecular approaches involving tailoring viruses to suit field challenges are in progress. However, the simple use of two genetically different vaccines to protect against a wide range of heterologous types is now a widespread practice that is very effective. 5. None of the three diseases described can claim to be satisfactorily controlled and it remains to be seen whether the newer generations of vaccines will be more efficacious and cost effective. The importance of constant surveillance is emphasised and the testing of novel vaccines cannot be achieved without the use of vaccine-challenge experiments in poultry.",

Three other viral respiratory diseases constitute what might be called the ''second tier'' of importance in terms of disease severity, namely infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT), avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) infections (the cause of infections turkey rhinotracheitis, avian rhinotracheitis) and infectious bronchitis (IB). Of these, IB is the most economically important and in the UK alone, it has been reported to be responsible for losses amounting to some \u00a323 million annually. For all three, disease severity can be exacerbated and prolonged by concurrent infections with bacteria including E. coli and Mycoplasma gallisepticum or if the birds are immunosuppressed by infectious bursal disease or chicken anaemia virus infection. However, this paper will concentrate on the uncomplicated infections alone.",

Infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) is an alpha-herpes virus assigned to the Iltovirus genus ( Figure 1 ). ILT was one of the earliest diseases described for poultry (1925) and affects chickens and pheasants but rarely turkeys. Avian metapneumovirus (aMPV, Figure 2 ) belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family and is the cause of turkey rhinotracheitis, originally reported in South Africa in the late 1970s, but it affects chickens also and is the ''youngest'' of the three. IB, caused by a type 3 coronavirus (Figure 3 ), was first reported in 1931 but still flourishes. Despite years of attempting to control the diseases caused by these viruses by the use of vaccines, they are still present.",

Live ILT vaccines can also become latent (Hughes et al., 1991) . The consequences are that latent virus can become reactivated by factors such as stress or onset of lay (Hughes et al., 1989) , so that such a flock can become an unrecognised source of infection (Williams et al., 1992) . There are no known wild bird reservoirs of this virus and there is no evidence that it is egg transmitted (Bagust & Johnson, 1995) .",

            "text": "Empirical attenuated ILT vaccines either of chick embryo origin (CEO) or tissue culture origin (TCO) have been used for many years with success (Guy & Garcia, 2008) . Some time ago we discovered that the commercial vaccine used in the UK behaved in the same way as a field virus, that is, it had the same latency characteristics as wild type ILTV in the bird and persisted for life (Hughes et al., 1991) . Thus, it was perceived that a significant proportion of disease could be due to vaccine virus becoming ''wild'' and recently referred to in the USA as ''vaccinal laryngotracheitis''. Molecular analysis, as shown above, has confirmed that this is the case. However, Korean workers found that one of four conventional ILT vaccines protects against virus latency (Han & Kim, 2003) . Despite the presence of ILTV strains genetically different from vaccine strains, Problems associated with conventional ILT vaccines have included vaccinal reactions, especially where other respiratory agents are present, reversion of vaccine viruses to virulence and latency with later reactivation. In addition, because ILT vaccines are not usually given until 10 weeks of age or later, birds are vulnerable up to this point. As a result, several new approaches have been explored to produce a new generation of safer vaccines. These include the production of a glycoprotein G-deficient vaccine (Devlin et al., 2008) , G being associated with latency and a fowl pox vector carrying ILTV genes (Davison et al., 2006) or glycoprotein G together with the haemagglutinin of Newcastle Disease virus (Sun et al., 2008) . It remains to be seen whether vaccines of this type will prove to be more efficacious than the empirically derived vaccines.",

It was soon shown to cause respiratory disease in chickens too (avian rhinotracheitis, ART) and sometimes swollen head syndrome (SHS) (Gough & Jones, 2008) . aMPV soon spread to Europe and the Middle East and most parts of the world where commercial poultry are kept, apart from Australia and North America. Initially, two subtypes of virus were recognised, A and B, based on differences in the surface glycoprotein gene sequences (Juhasz & Easton, 1994) . In 1996, a third subtype, C was identified in the USA in turkeys in Colorado and later in the important turkey producing state of Minnesota (Seal, 1998) . In the USA, the disease is called ''avian pneumovirus infection of turkeys'' and subtype C does not appear to be important in chickens. Subsequently, a subtype D was described in France (B\u00e4yon-Auboyer et al., 2000) and a variant C appeared in ducks in the same country (Toquin et al., 2008) . Surprisingly, a subtype C has been reported in South Korea in pheasants in a market (Lee et al., 2007) . aMPV primarily affects the respiratory tract, especially the upper tissues (Figure 4) , and is able to replicate in the oviduct, the latter resulting in loss of egg production and quality (Gough & Jones, 2008) .",

Perhaps even more puzzling is the fact that while subtype C has been present in turkeys in the USA, principally Minnesota, with its many lakes, while A and B are present in Central and South America, there is no apparent mixing of subtypes in the two regions, despite the migratory flight paths of wild waterfowl between the north and south. Evidence of aMPV infection in wild birds has been reported in the USA (Shin et al., 2002; Turpin et al., 2008) , but this in itself does not mean that infected species are able to transmit infection to susceptible poultry.",

Killed vaccines are given by injection before the onset of lay but only after priming with live vaccines. Except for the USA, where subtype C is present, A and B are the prevalent subtypes elsewhere and vaccines against each of these two give good protection against the other (Cook et al., 1995) .

Subtype A and B vaccines have been used successfully in most countries and in both species, where the disease is prevalent.

The spike is in two parts, S1 and S2 and the gene coding for the S1 spike has a hypervariable region which is liable to mutate or undergo reassortment with other IBVs, thus generating novel variant IBVs. The S1 spike is important in viral attachment, is a major component in development of immunity and has traditionally been important for cross-neutralisation, the original basis for IBV classification. The different types of IBV generally give little or no protection against heterologous types, although there are some exceptions. Important variants appear from time to time in a very unpredictable manner and are a constant challenge to vaccine strategies. Hence there is a constant need for surveillance of prevalent types.",

The most prevalent genotypes were Massachusetts and the major variant 793B (4/91 or CR88) ( Figure 5 ). On the basis of nucleotide sequence shared identity, approximately 50% of each were considered to be vaccine virus (H120, MA5, 4/91, IB88, etc). The next most common genotypes were two new important field types: Italy 02 and a virus originally detected in China called QX (Worthington et al., 2008) . The origins of Italy 02 are unknown (Dolz et al., 2006) but QX originated in China in 1996 (Wang et al., 1998) , though how it arrived in Europe is unknown. Italy 02 has behaved primarily as a respiratory pathogen, but QX has had more serious consequences, causing nephritis in young flocks and false layers in egg laying flocks. This survey is an example of the diversity of IBV genotypes in a region and the appearance of new ones. Considerable diversity has been well documented for USA, Australia and China and in recent years, reports of novel genotypes have been published from Brazil , Argentina (Rimondi et al., 2009) , Thailand (Pohuang et al., 2009) , Malaysia (Zulperi et al., 2009) and Africa (Ducatez et al., 2009) .

(3) Use molecular techniques to engineer a vaccine for the new challenge virus that will not revert to virulence. Recent examples of this are modified DNA vaccination (Tian et al., 2008; Tan et al., 2009 ) and a multi-epitope-based peptide vaccine . One of the most promising of the new generation of vaccine appears to be the ''spike swapping'' technology, whereby using reverse genetics, an infectious clone is produced into which specific S1 spike genes can be incorporated, appropriate to the new variant (Casais et al., 2001) . Variations on this theme have also included incorporation of nucleocapsid genes or specific cytokines to induce a broader immunity (Cavanagh et al., 2007) . (4) Use two heterologous IBV vaccines (Cook et al., 1999) . This method has been shown to be very successful, even though the mechanisms have not been elucidated to date. It is usual to first administer a Massachusetts-type vaccine followed by a variant (793B-type in Europe) offers wide protection against types which are different again (Figure 7) . Such a programme Jones, 1996) . . The use of two heterologous vaccines (Massachusetts H120) and 4/91 gives good protection against a strain of IBV unrelated to either (here A1121).

The main choice for future strategies in IBV control seems to be as follows: (i) production of a specific tailored vaccine, produced by molecular technology and designed to protect against the variant challenge virus. This has the advantage that once the virus ''carrier'' is established, mechanisms for the insertion of the appropriate S1 spike gene (perhaps with accessory genes for cytokines etc., are now available. However, the question arises as to how many tailored vaccines the bird can take, if the numbers of variants in the challenge become large. (ii) The use of two different vaccines. This is simple to employ but is not guaranteed to succeed in every case and the mechanisms have not been fully established. However, unless a ''pan-IBV'' vaccine was to be produced (which is unlikely), this is a significant and very successful ''stop-gap'' approach. IBV shows viral evolution in action and is likely to remain one step ahead.",

ILTV affects the chicken not the turkey, exists as a single serotype, but strains show differences in virulence. Genetic differences can be demonstrated but it is not clear how important they are in vaccine formulation. Vaccines have remained relatively unchanged but improved ones are needed for avoidance of vaccine reactions and problems of long immunity. In some countries, new strains are emerging but their origin is unknown. Four subtypes of aMPV exist. A and B are virtually worldwide, affecting chickens and turkeys. While existing vaccines are effective when given accurately, field evidence of reversion and perhaps virus evolution highlights the need for improved safer vaccines.",

Poor vaccine delivery, overwhelming field challenge, intercurrent infections, viral evolution, new variants from outside the immediate regions all conspire to militate against vaccinal efficacy. Existing vaccines may be described as restraining rather than fully controlling these diseases. It remains to be seen whether the new generation of vaccines will be more satisfactory than the existing empirical ones and cost effective. I think we can expect a move to in ovo delivery because of its convenience, even though it has not yet been taken up widely in Europe.",
