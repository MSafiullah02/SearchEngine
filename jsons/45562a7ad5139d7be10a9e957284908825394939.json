Serotherapy, the principle of which is very old, has been used in recent epidemics by the Chikungunya and Ebola viruses but also SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and A/H1N1. In COVID-19, two preliminary publications, one on 10 patients [1] and the other on 5 patients [2] , showed that the use of plasma from convalescent patients was well tolerated and could improve the clinical course of severe forms of COVID-19 by neutralizing the viral load and rapidly decreasing the CRP. Also, although the interpretation of these preliminary results is debatable in the absence of a control group and due to the very small size of the study population, the Food and Drug Administration has recently approved the principle of this treatment and numerous trials have begun or will begin in the United States and France to evaluate its benefits and risks.",
