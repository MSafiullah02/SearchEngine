An enormous number of different compounds have been considered or evaluated in vitro and in vivo with variable success. Only those currently in use for treatment of dogs and cats with naturally occurring infections, those that show considerable promise for the future, or those evaluated in controlled clinical trials are discussed in this chapter.",

In human patients, acyclovir is widely used to treat herpes simplex and varicella-zoster virus infections, both of which are \u03b1-herpesviruses. In small animal medicine, acyclovir has primarily been used to treat feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1) infections, although FHV-1 has a much lower susceptibility to the drug compared with the human herpesviruses.2 Acyclovir has also been used to treat canine herpesvirus-1 (CHV-1) infections in puppies (see Chapter 16). Other nucleoside analogues (trifluridine, idoxuridine, cidofovir, ganciclovir, and penciclovir) show much greater activity than acyclovir against FHV-1 in vitro.2., 3., 4.\n",

Unfortunately, administration of high doses of acyclovir or valacyclovir to cats has resulted in significant toxicity, including myelosuppression, renal tubular necrosis, and hepatic necrosis, without effective suppression of viral replication.8 Thus the use of systemic acyclovir and valacyclovir to treat cats with herpesvirus infections is not recommended.",

Penciclovir is another guanosine analogue (see Figure 7-1). It is present at much higher concentrations and for longer duration in cells than is acyclovir, which permits less frequent dosing. In humans, the prodrug famciclovir is well absorbed orally and rapidly converted to penciclovir, leading to increased oral bioavailability of penciclovir. Most of the drug is eliminated unchanged in the urine, and so dose reduction may be required for animals with decreased kidney function. In human patients, the concurrent administration of food decreases peak plasma concentrations without affecting overall bioavailability. In humans with herpes simplex virus and herpes zoster infections, famciclovir is as effective as acyclovir. In contrast, penciclovir (and thus famciclovir) have been shown to be potent inhibitors of FHV-1 replication (which is not the case for acyclovir). Penciclovir-resistant mutants of FHV-1 with altered TK enzymes have been described.9\n",

Nevertheless, famciclovir is well tolerated when administered orally to cats at doses that produce clinical responses.5., 10., 11. Treatment of cats with experimentally induced FHV-1 conjunctivitis with famciclovir at 90 mg/kg PO q8h for 21 days resulted in lower clinical and pathologic disease scores and decreased viral shedding when compared with placebo-treated cats.11 Clinical responses also occur in naturally infected cats with both acute and chronic manifestations of disease with negligible adverse effects.5 Because of saturation of the metabolism of famciclovir to penciclovir, equivalent serum and tear penciclovir concentrations can be achieved in cats with 40 or 90 mg/kg PO q8h of famciclovir, so 40 mg/kg PO q8h is considered equally efficacious.12., 13. Clinical improvement often occurs within a week of treatment.",

Thus, although it can increase neutrophil counts in some FIV-infected cats, long-term use of filgrastim is not recommended.55 Recombinant canine G-CSF (rcG-CSF) may be safer for long-term use in dogs, and possibly also cats. One recombinant canine formulation mobilized neutrophils in dogs within 24 hours of administration.56 Recombinant canine G-CSF reduces the severity and duration of bone marrow suppression induced by cyclophosphamide in dogs.57 In a prospective, non-randomized clinical trial for treatment of CPV infection, neutrophil counts were higher and hospital times were shorter in dogs treated with rcG-CSF, but survival times were decreased.58 Treatment of canine and feline parvovirus infections with G-CSF might cause harm, because the increased cell turnover induced by the drug might promote parvovirus replication. Further studies are required to evaluate the utility of rcG-CSF for treatment of neutropenias associated with canine parvoviral enteritis, feline retrovirus infections, and chronic canine monocytic ehrlichiosis.",

However, glucocorticoid administration also has the potential to worsen outcome through excessive immune suppression, so their use has been advocated only for specific infectious diseases under certain circumstances. Glucocorticoids can also contribute to development of secondary infections even when they are used to treat another disease. For example, it is not unusual in dogs or cats for a latent infection to emerge, or for a secondary infection to develop (e.g., demodicosis, staphylococcal pyoderma, dermatophytosis, systemic mycoses) when glucocorticoids are used to produce immunosuppression.",
