In humans and mice, APCs have reduced ligand expression, which is necessary for stimulating specific immune responses, compared to adults. Although this has not been specifically evaluated in dogs, APCs may not be mature in neonatal puppies.",

Thymic development begins on day 27 of gestation, followed by lymphoid infiltration into secondary lymphoid organs, including spleen and lymph nodes, on days 45 to 52 of gestation.

The majority of T cells, almost 90%, are naive at birth compared to only 40% at 4 months of age, indicating progressive maturation of the T cell population during this time. The number of B lymphocytes in neonates is much higher than adults, but after the initial increase, B cell lymphocyte numbers decline until 16 weeks of age. The high proportion of B lymphocytes in newborns likely represents early B cell stimulation and maturation in response to new antigens. T cytotoxic lymphocytes are important in cell-mediated immunity and are low at birth. This finding may lend support to human and mouse studies showing downregulation of cell-mediated immunity in neonates. Because T cytotoxic lymphocytes are important for detecting and inactivating intracellular pathogens, the low numbers of T cytotoxic lymphocytes at birth may predispose a newborn to intracellular viral or bacterial infections. T cytotoxic lymphocytes increase steadily with age, whereas CD4+ T lymphocytes maintain at relatively steady numbers from birth to adulthood.",

However, the antibody responses are variable and not as pronounced when compared to adults. Functional and specific lymphocyte responses are also present at birth, but similar to the fetus, antibody responses are often only a portion of the adult antibody response. One study observed adequate antibody response in day-old puppies immunized with a modified live canine parvovirus strain, suggesting some antigens may elicit an adequate antibody response, or some puppies have a higher level of immune development.

Similar to the dog, lymphocytes have been detected in fetal circulation at approximately 25 days of gestation. Lymphocytes have also been detected in the thymus, spleen, and liver at between 28 to 52 days of gestation supporting fetal development of lymphoid tissue. In late gestation, there is a significant increase in peripheral T lymphocytes, which remain elevated after birth becoming the primary circulating lymphocyte in the adult. CD4+ T lymphocytes are present in higher numbers than CD8+ T lymphocytes, resulting in a high CD4:CD8 ratio at birth. The low numbers of CD8+ T lymphocytes at birth may be an effect of the queen's immune status during pregnancy downregulating cell-mediated immunity, although this has not been evaluated in cats. CD8+ T lymphocytes begin to increase through 8 weeks of age, lowering the CD4+:CD8+ ratio. B cell numbers increase right after birth until 4 weeks of age, likely representative of maturation of the humoral immune response, then steadily decrease to adult values. The timeline for reaching adult distribution of lymphocyte subsets has not been definitively established but is thought to occur before 12 months of age. Similar to the puppy, kittens are immunocompetent at birth but appear to have restricted immune responses compared to adults. Antigenic stimulation of the fetus has not been documented in kittens so conclusions about fetal response to antigens are unknown.",

These involve the shift of T-helper cells from a Th1 to a Th2 response and a decrease in neutrophil functions. The T cell populations are affected by progesterone, prostaglandin F2\u03b1, and \u03b1-fetoprotein. The Th1 cells are important effectors of the cell-mediated immune (CMI) response and interact with T cytotoxic lymphocytes. As mentioned earlier, the T cytotoxic lymphocytes are the main defense against intracellular pathogens. With the onset of pregnancy, the hormonal factors cause macrophages to release predominantly Th2-stimulating cytokines that contribute to the overall dominance of humoral immunity during pregnancy and immediately postpartum. This phenomenon of the Th cell populations is referred to as the \u201cTh1-Th2 shift of pregnancy\u201d and is generally regarded as a contributing factor to maternal tolerance of the fetus by suppressing the antifetal CMI response.",

            "text": "The outcomes of the temporary immunodeficiency states allow for fetal survival but may also result in an increased susceptibility to environmental infections by bacteria and fungi. Intracellular infections, such as viruses and protozoans, which may have been acquired during postnatal development, may become exacerbated during pregnancy because of the suppressive effects on the Th1 cells. This suppression results in a decreased CMI response. The CMI effector cells, the T cytotoxic lymphocytes, function normally to control virtually all the viral infections such as canine herpesvirus. Intracellular bacterial infections, such as Brucella canis, become more pathogenic during pregnancy. In addition to the aforementioned effects on T cell function, macrophage function is also compromised, allowing opportunistic bacteria, which are usually confined to external mucosal surfaces of the body, to become systemic. Concurrent with the immunosuppression that accompanies pregnancy, there is an increased shedding of infectious microorganisms. This is considered to be an extension of impaired T cytotoxic lymphocyte function. Although the pregnant animal may appear clinically normal, her altered immune response results in an increased shedding of gastrointestinal viruses, such as canine coronavirus and canine rotavirus, and bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, usually during the periparturient period. This increase in shedding of infectious microorganisms is an important factor when addressing the issues of management of animals through this period of time (Figure 14-2\n). The suppression of neutrophil functions during later stages of pregnancy and immediately postpartum are the subject of active investigation.",

In comparison to humans in which a significant amount of immunoglobulins are transferred transplacentally, dogs have an endotheliochorial placenta with four layers separating fetal and maternal blood. This type of placentation results in very little maternal immunoglobulin transfer to the fetus, with reported transplacental immunoglobulin transfer ranging from 5% to 10%. Colostrum is important for early antibody protection in puppies. In puppies, only small amounts of immunoglobulin G (IgG) are detected before colostrum ingestion and immunoglobulin A (IgA) is undetectable until after colostrum intake, supporting poor transplacental transfer. In mammals, intestinal permeability for immunoglobulin absorption is highest right after birth and decreases by 6 hours to a very low level of absorption 24 hours after birth. A low level of intestinal absorption of immunoglobulins continues while the puppy is nursing. Specific receptors in the intestine bind the immunoglobulin, which is then taken up by epithelial cells, transferred into lacteals, and into the circulation. Immunity from colostrum depends on the vaccination and immune status of the dam, as well as the quantity of colostrum ingested. The amount of colostral antibody can be quite variable between littermates, depending on the amount of colostrum ingested, the time ingested, and the size of the litter.",

Little information has been published about leukocytes or other proteins in canine colostrum, but some cellular material is transferred from the dam to the puppy. In dogs, IgG predominates in colostrum with slightly less IgA and very little immunoglobulin M (IgM). The peak immunoglobulin concentration in puppies ingesting colostrum is 12 to 24 hours after birth. Once colostrum transitions to milk, the concentrations of immunoglobulin significantly decrease in milk. The predominance of IgG in colostrum switches to a predominance of IgA in milk with only low levels of IgM and IgG detected at 6 weeks of lactation. This form of passive immunity is referred to as lactogenic immunity. The IgA has been shown to inhibit adherence of infectious agents to mucosal surfaces, neutralizing potential intestinal mucosal pathogens. Maternal antibody helps protect the neonate puppy but will also cause a refractory period to vaccination until maternal antibody declines.",

Loss of immunoglobulins is also dependent on antibody class with IgA degraded first, followed by IgM, and then IgG. Rapidly growing breeds have also been shown to break down maternally derived immunoglobulin at a faster rate. As maternal antibody decreases, endogenous immunoglobulin secretion steadily increases. The immunoglobulins tend to increase in order from IgM to IgG followed by IgA. These immunoglobulins reach adult levels at 2 to 3 months, 6 to 9 months, and 12 months, respectively.",

As maternal antibody is decreasing, there is a window in which maternal immunoglobulin may decrease below protective levels but persist at high enough levels to interfere with vaccination and protective immune responses. This dangerous window is one reason that multiple vaccines are given close together in puppies less than 16 weeks of age to stimulate the immune system at the earliest time possible before exposure of antigen. It is important to know if the puppy has received colostrum because vaccination guidelines will differ, depending on whether colostrum was ingested.

The major problem with vaccination protocols is determining the appropriate time to administer the vaccine to achieve optimal immunization. There are three main obstacles to consider when vaccinating puppies and kittens, including the immature immune system, possible bias toward humoral immunity, and presence of maternal antibodies. Although in-depth research has not been performed specifically in cats and dogs, comparative studies done in humans and mice have observed reduced expression of ligands on APCs and lymphocytes in neonates, resulting in decreased interaction between these cells. The APC and lymphocyte interaction is necessary to stimulate a specific T cell response. Another difference in neonates compared to adults is the late development of splenic architecture with APCs, such as macrophages and B cells, developing later than T cells. Additionally B cells, which are also APCs, have decreased expression of receptors and ligands, leading to less crosstalk between B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes compared to the adult, resulting in a blunted antibody response. Some of these factors are contributors to a shift toward the humoral-mediated immune response, as well as a blunted immune response. In addition to the immaturity of the immune system, maternal antibody interferes with endogenous production of immunoglobulins, as well as response to vaccine antigens until 6 to 16 weeks of age.",

Vaccine reactions can occur locally at the injection site or systemically. Systemic effects can range from generalized malaise to hypersensitivity reactions or sometimes neoplasia.

Hypersensitivity reactions can include immediate reactions occurring within minutes to hours to more delayed reactions that occur 24 to 72 hours or even 7 to 45 days after vaccination. Hypersensitivity reactions can result from a type I hypersensitivity reaction mediated by IgE resulting in anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic reactions occur within minutes to a few hours after vaccine administration and clinical signs can include edema and pruritus, often seen in the dog, or vomiting and diarrhea in cats. More significant sequelae can occur, including respiratory distress, hypovolemia, and shock. Type II hypersensitivity, which is an autoimmune reaction, is also thought to occur after vaccination in some dogs. This has not been definitively proved; however, immune-mediated thrombocytopenia and anemia have been reported in conjunction with recent immunization. Type III hypersensitivity, or immune complex disease, is another type of reaction that can be seen with some vaccines. A specific example in the dog includes anterior uveitis, which occurs approximately 10 to 21 days after canine adenovirus-1 (CAV-1) vaccination as a result of antibody-antigen complex deposition. The last type of hypersensitivity is type IV hypersensitivity, which is a delayed response resulting in granuloma formation at the site of vaccination. Granulomas can resolve within weeks to months in some animals and are typically seen with adjuvant vaccines. In cats, inflammation can persist sometimes, transitioning from chronic inflammation to a neoplastic process resulting in an injection site sarcoma.",

Although not scientifically proved, these concerns should persist until evidence proves otherwise. A possible mechanism of vaccine-associated autoimmunity is epitope mimicry, in which an antigen in a vaccine is similar to a self\u2013antigen, causing the immune response to be directed at an antigen on a population of the animal's cells. Certain types of adjuvant can stimulate different pathways of the immune response and some vaccines may stimulate differentiation of pathogenic lymphocytes that recognize self\u2013antigens. It has been shown that all adult humans have some B and T cell lymphocytes that recognize self\u2013antigens; however, these cells are typically quiescent. With some vaccinations, these cells could become reactive or overreactive, resulting in autoimmunity. Because neonates often have a reduced immune response, it is thought they may be more protected from autoimmune reactions. Further studies need to be performed to confirm vaccine-associated autoimmune reactions and potential consequences in the neonate.",

With the increased concerns about adverse effects of vaccination, there has been a trend to use antibody titers to specific viral antigens to assess immune competence and in some cases, provide information on protective levels of antibody. This practice has gained acceptance for those breeds of dogs and cats that have adverse effects after vaccination but usually applies to animals over 1 year of age. Antibody titer evaluation has been used more within the first year of life to determine if puppies and kittens are receiving adequate levels of maternal antibody and if they would benefit from a booster at 6 months of age.
