This study investigates cytokine expression and proteomic change induced by SARS-CoV PLpro in human promonocyte cells. PLpro significantly increased TGF-\u24241 mRNA expression (greater than fourfold) and protein production (greater than threefold). Proteomic analysis, Western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR assays indicated PLpro upregulating TGF-\u24241-associated genes: HSP27, protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor, glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, retinal dehydrogenase 2, and glutathione transferase omega-1. PLpro-activated ubiquitin proteasome pathway via upregulation of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2-25k and proteasome subunit alpha type 5. Proteasome inhibitor MG-132 significantly reduced expression of TGF-\u24241 and vimentin. PLpro upregulated HSP27, linking with activation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaling. Treatment with SB203580 and U0126 reduced PLpro-induced expression of TGF-\u24241, vimentin, and type I collagen. Results point to SARS-CoV PLpro triggering TGF-\u24241 production via ubiquitin proteasome, p38 MAPK, and ERK1/2-mediated signaling.",

            "text": "cytokine storms are linked with recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, and immune responder cells such as natural killer, T, and B cells into the lungs, resulting in acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, even lung fibrosis in the late phase [7] . SARS-CoV genome is an approximately 30 kbp positivestranded RNA with a 5 cap and 3 poly(A) tract, containing 14 ORFs [8, 9] . Polyprotein replicases 1a and 1ab (\u223c450 and \u223c750 kDa, respectively) encoded by 5 proximal, producing nonstructural (NS) proteins primarily involved in RNA replication. Specifically, papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease, two embedded proteases, mediate the processing of 1a and 1ab precursors into 16 NS proteins (termed NS 1 through NS16). PLpro recognizes a consensus motif LXGG as consensus cleavage sequence of cellular deubiquitinating enzymes, and cleaves polyprotein replicase 1a at NS1/2, NS2/3, and NS3/4 boundaries [10, 11] . Modeling with crystal structures of herpes virus associated ubiquitinspecific protease and in vitro cleavage assays reveal SARS-CoV PLpro as a deubiquitinating enzyme [12, 13] . These in vitro de-ubiquination assays illustrate cleavage of interferon (IFN)-induced 15-kDa protein (ISG15)-conjugated proteins by PLpro [12, 13] . Deubiquitinating/de-ISGylating activity of PLpro is believed to link with a mechanism that SARS-CoV infection induces on type I IFNs in cell culture [14] . PLpro is further identified by blocking type I IFN synthesis through inhibiting phosphorylation of IFN regulatory factor 3 [15] . PLpro antagonizes type I IFN signaling pathway by polyubiquitination and degradation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1), resulting in the inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation and decrease of IFN-stimulated gene expression such as PKR, 2 -5 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), IL-6, and IL-8 [16] . A deubiquitinating enzyme cylindromatosis that inhibits NF-B signaling via deubiquitination and inactivation of tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF6 [17] has been reported to promote inflammatory responses via mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated but NF-B independent pathways [18] . Deubiquitinating protease A20 inhibits TLR4-mediated NF-B activation, directly removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains of TRAF6 while reducing production of antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines by inactivation of RIG-I dependent antiviral signaling [19] . Yet the role of deubiquitinating enzyme PLpro in anti-inflammation and proinflammatory response remains unclear. This study assesses possible effect of SARS-CoV PLpro on cytokine induction: TGF-\u24241, TNF-\u2423, IFN-\u2424, IL-1\u2423, regulated and normal T cell expressed and secreted protein (RANTES). Comparative proteomic analysis of PLpro expressing versus vector control cells yielded data on the relation between TGF-\u24241 production and protein expression change induced by PLpro, affording insights into molecular mechanism(s) of SARS pathogenesis.",

After two-week selection with G418, quantitative real-time PCR showed significant expression of PLpro mRNA in transfected versus control cells (Fig. 1A ). Immunofluorescent staining with sera from hyper-immunized mice with recombinant PLpro protein indicated immunoreactive fluorescence in transfected as opposed to empty vector cells (Fig. 1B) . Western blot analysis with sera of mice hyper-immunized with E.coli-synthesized PLpro identified a 60-kDa band recombinant PLpro protein in transfected cells but not controls (Fig. 1C) , indicating SARS-CoV PLpro stably expressed in human promonocyte cells. Because PLpro suppressed IFN-\u2423 signaling pathway via inactivation of ERK1 and STAT1 [16] , effect of SARS-CoV PLpro expression on cytokine production (TGF-\u24241, TNF-\u2423, IL-1\u2423, IFN-\u2424, and RANTES) was further characterized via SYBR Green real-time PCR (Fig. 2) . Cytokine mRNA levels in PLpro-expressing and vector control cells were quantified and then normalized to housekeeping gene GAPDH expression. PLpro alone induced mRNA expression of TGF-\u24241 (greater than fourfold), IL-1\u2423 (approximately threefold), and RANTES (approximately twofold) ( Fig. 2A, D, and E ), yet no significant rise in TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 compared to vector controls ( Fig. 2B and C) . IFN-\u2423 treatment stimulated higher transcriptional levels of TNF-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424, but not TGF-\u24241, IL-1\u2423, and RANTES in vector controls than in PLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 2) . To confirm PLpro-induced TGF-\u24241 expression, cultured media and lysates were harvested from identical amounts of vector control and PLpro-expressing cells grown with FBS-free medium for 24 h, coated into 96-well plates for ELISA assay with rabbit anti-TGF-\u24241 Ab (Fig. 3) . TGF-\u24241 in cultured media and cell lysates of PLpro-expressing cells were twice as high as in vector controls, indicating that PLpro plays a unique role in upregulating TGF-\u24241 production.",

Of SARS-CoV proteins, nucleocapsid increased expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 via the Smad3-dependent TGF-\u24241 signaling pathway [25] . Baculovirus synthesized spike protein activated MAPKs and AP-1, leading to IL-8 release in lung cells [26] . Nonstructure protein 1-but not nonstructured protein 5, envelope, and membrane-induced mRNA expression of CCL5, CXCL10, and CCL3 via activation of NF-B [27] . This study demon-strated that PLpro-potentiated induction of TGF-\u24241, IL-1\u2423, and RANTES, particularly inducing more than a threefold increase of TGF-\u24241 compared to vector controls (Figs. 2A,D, and E and 3). Of these three cytokines, TGF-\u24241 has been reported to stimulate epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation (EMT) and induced kidney and lung fibrosis [28, 29] . PLpro can trigger the cytokine storm while playing a vital role in SARS-CoV-induced lung damage. Schematic figure of proteomic profiling induced by SARS-CoV PLpro (Fig. 8) was confirmed by Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR, and specific inhibitors (Figs 5-7) , showing up-and downregulated proteins identified as linked with TGF-\u24241 production in PLpro-expressing cells. Proteomic analysis indicated PLpro upregulating expression of many TGF-\u24241-associated genes, e.g. HSP27 (Spot ID 1), vimentin (Spot ID 7), protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor (Spot ID 11), retinal dehydrogenase 2 (Spot ID 13), glial fibrillary acidic protein (Spot ID 17), glutathione transferase omega-1 (Spot ID 21) (Fig. 8, Table 1 ). Functional analysis using PANTHER classification system demonstrated PLpro upregulating cytoskeleton proteins such as vimentin (Spot ID 7) , T-complex protein 1 subunit epsilon (Spot ID 9), desmoplakin (Spot ID 12), junction plakoglobin (Spot ID 16), glial fibrillary acidic protein (Spot ID 17), and tropomyosin alpha-3 chain (TPM3, Spot ID 18). These cytoskeleton proteins were involved in cell adhesion, cellular component morphogenesis, immune system process, signal transduction, and/or cell motion. Meanwhile, cytoskeleton protein changes and induction of such processes correlated with greater TGF-\u24241 production by PLpro. Recent reports verified TGF-\u24241-mediated vimentin upregulation in alveolar epithelial cells as adequate for healing injured lung tissue [23, 24, 30] . Vimentin upregulation was consistent with activation of profibrotic cytokines TGF-\u24241 induced by SARS-CoV PLpro. Vimentin, HSP27, glial fibrillary acidic protein, retinal dehydrogenase 2, and glutathione transferase omega-1 linked with TGF-\u24241-induced EMT pathogenesis and fibrosis [23, 24, 31, 32] . Protein disulfide isomerase A3 precursor influenced release and activation of latent TGF-\u24241 from extracellular matrix [33] , whereas glutathione transferase omega-1 polymorphism correlated with expression of TGF-\u24241 [34] .",

Given proteomic profiling induced by PLpro, we hypothesized the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasomal system, p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 signaled as linked with PLpro-induced upregulation of TGF-\u24241 and vimentin. Notably, the inhibitor MG-132 treatment confirmed the upregulation of ubiquitin-proteasomal system as involved in PLpro-induced expression of TGF-\u24241 and vimentin (Fig. 6) . Ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway modulated TGF-\u24241 signaling by regulating expression and activity of effectors in a TGF-\u24241 signaling cascade [35, 36] . Also, proteasome inhibitor MG-132 would definitely reduce TGF-\u24241 signaling as well as inhibit activity of Smads and AKT [37, 38] , e.g. E3 ubiquitin ligases of ubiquitin-proteasonal system increased ubiquitination and degradation of Smad7 and TGF-\u2424 receptor I, which activate p38 MAPK-and JNK-mediated TGF-\u24241 signaling [39] [40] [41] . Inhibiting PLpro-induced expression of TGF-\u24241 and vimentin by proteasome inhibitor MG-132 support our hypothesis of ubiquitin-proteasonal system as involved in TGF-\u24241 induction.",
