Adherence to this measure will be made explicitly compulsory in many places. However, since it is impossible to control each and every person in a country, it is important to complement governmental laws with behavioral interventions devised to impact people's behavior beyond the force of law. Here we report a pre-registered online experiment (N=2,459) using a heterogenous, although not representative, sample of people living in the USA, where we test the relative effect of messages highlighting that the coronavirus is a threat to \"you\" vs \"your family\" vs \"your community\" vs \"your country\" on self-reported intentions to wear a face covering. Results show that focusing on \"your community\" promotes intentions to wear a face covering relative to the baseline; the trend is the same when comparing \"your community\" to the other conditions, but not significant. We also conducted pre-registered analyses of gender differences on intentions to wear a face covering. We find that men less than women intend to wear a face covering, but this difference almost disappears in counties where wearing a face covering is mandatory. We also find that men less than women believe that they will be seriously affected by the coronavirus, and this partly mediates gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering (this is particularly ironic because official statistics actually show that men are affected by the COVID-19 more seriously than women). Finally, we also find gender differences in self-reported negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering. Men more than women agree that wearing a face covering is shameful, not cool, a sign of weakness, and a stigma; and these gender differences also mediate gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering.",

These numbers clearly tell about the deadly power of this coronavirus: since the baseline number of deaths worldwide is about 57 million people a year, if the coronavirus were to hit the planet with the same power as it hit Bergamo, Guayas or New York, somewhere between 150 millions and 250 millions people could die in a year.",

At the time of this writing, about one third of the world population is under some form of restriction (Kaplan, Frias, & McFall-Johnsen, 2020) . However, restrictions are highly costly in the long-term, both economically and psychologically (Van Bavel et al. 2020) .

This raises an important question. Which types of messages are most effective in promoting pandemic responses that are in line with the recommendations of the medical profession? Social and behavioral science can be helpful in answering this question (Van Bavel et al. 2020) . Accordingly, several works in the past month have explored the effect of several types of messages on pandemic response (Bilancini et al. 2020; Everett et al. 2020; Heffner, Vives, & FeldmanHall, 2020; Jordan et al. 2020) .",

Yet, decades of social and psychological research shows that people sometimes do not act solely to maximize their own payoff: at least in economic games, a substantial proportion of people appear to be driven by moral preferences (Krupka & Weber, 2013; Kimbrough & Vostroknutov, 2016; Eriksson et al., 2017; Capraro & Rand, 2018; Tappin & Capraro, 2018) .

The rationale for this analysis comes from the observation that previous work has found that men intend to engage in preventive behaviors less than women do (Jordan et al. 2020) . Therefore, we predicted that we would find gender differences also in intentions to wear a face covering. Clearly, understanding whether there are such differences could be important to tailor interventions specifically on men. For this reason, we reasoned that, beyond asking intentions to wear a face covering, it would have been important to also collect self-reported emotions felt when wearing a face covering. The idea is that it is possible that men more than women report having negative feelings when wearing a face covering, and this could eventually mediate the gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering.",

It seemed that gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering were particularly strong in counties were wearing a face covering was not mandatory, while they almost disappeared in counties were wearing a face covering was mandatory. In other words, it seemed that making mandatory the wear of a face covering affected men's intentions to a greater extent than women's intentions. Therefore, we took advantage of the second session of data collection to further explore this effect. Moreover, in the second session, we decided to include questions about the subjective likelihood to get the coronavirus disease and, if so, the subjective likelihood to get over it relatively easily. Our rationale was that it is possible that these variables mediate gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering, and maybe also in emotions felt when wearing a face covering.

In Session 1 we asked participants whether they were tested positive, whether they were tested negative, whether they were not tested but believe to have had the coronavirus. In session 2, we replaced the last two questions with two questions regarding the subjective likelihood of getting infected and the subjective likelihood of recovering relatively easily in case they get infected. These variables were formulated as follows. We asked subjects to report the extent to which they agree with the statement \"I believe that it is unlikely that I will get the coronavirus (COVID-19)\" and with the statement \"If I get the coronavirus (COVID-19), I believe I will get over it relatively easily\".

Here, we report this analysis directly on the whole sample (session 1 and session 2 together). First, we build this composite variable by taking the average of its five items, after reversing the first item (a = 0.747). Then, as preregistered, we use linear regression to check the effect of sex and age on this variable, first in the baseline condition and then in all conditions together, in order to test for robustness. In the baseline, we find that being a female is significantly less associated with negative emotions felt wearing a face covering (b = -0.329, p = 0.037), as it is also being older (b = -0.012, p = 0.049). Putting all conditions together, we obtain a similar effect of gender (b = -0.398, p < 0.001), while the effect of age becomes smaller and marginally significant (b = -0.004, p = 0.059). If we control, as pre-registered, for all the demographic variable (see Table  3 ), both the effects of gender and age are highly significant. Controlling for the demographic variables also reveal a significant effect of political views (right-leaning people tend to have more negative feelings when wearing a face covering). We also conduct non-preregistered exploratory analyses over the \"intentions to wear a face covering\" variable to see whether these individual differences remain significant. We find that they do. Being a female is associated with greater intentions to wear a face covering; the same holds true for being leftleaning and for being older. Interestingly, we find that living in a county where wearing a face covering is mandatory impacts people's intentions to wear a face covering, but not the negative emotions that they feel when wearing a face covering.

Linear regression predicting intentions to wear a face covering as a function of sex, a dummy variable that takes into account whether the face covering is mandatory, and their interaction, reveals a significant main effect of gender (b = 0.776, p < .001), a significant main effect of whether wearing a face covering is mandatory (b = 1.755, p < .001), and, crucially, a significant interaction (b = -0.499, p = 0.031). The interaction is driven by the fact that gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering are very strong when wearing a face covering is not mandatory (b = 0.720, p < .001), but less so when wearing a face covering is mandatory (b = 0.298, p = 0.026).

Regressing the negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering over gender and the subjective likelihood to get infected, we do find that the likelihood to get infected variable is significant (b = 0.145, p < .001), but this time the coefficient of the gender variable (b = -0.396) is essentially the same as the coefficient of the gender variable that is obtained when regressing the negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering over the gender variable only (b = -0.398). Similarly, regressing the negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering over gender and the subjective likelihood to get over the disease easily in case one gets it, we do find that the likelihood to get over it variable is significant (b = 0.145, p < .001), but this time the coefficient of the gender variable (b = -0.400) is essentially the same as the coefficient of the gender variable obtained when regressing the negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering over the gender variable only (b = -0.398). In sum, gender differences in negative emotions felt from wearing the face covering do not seem to be explained by gender differences in the subjective likelihood of getting infected and, in case so, of getting over it easily; on the other hand, gender differences in these two variables partly explain gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering.",

Understanding this might help think about particular interventions focused to promote the use of face covering among men. To this end, we look at gender differences at the item level. We find gender differences in all items: when people are asked whether they agree with the statement \"wearing a face covering is cool\" (b = 0.249, p = 0.032), when people are asked whether they agree with the statement \"wearing a face covering is not cool\" (b = -0.363, p = 0.006), when people are asked whether they agree with the statement \"wearing a face covering is shameful\" (b = -0.472, p < .001), when people are asked whether they agree with the statement \"wearing a face covering is a sign of weakness\" (b = -0.481, p < .001), and when people are asked whether they agree with the statement \"the stigma attached to wearing a face covering is preventing me from wearing one as often as I should\" (b = -0.489, p < .001). These results are robust to the inclusion of all the other demographic controls.",

Results show that focusing on \"your community\" is better than the baseline; we also find a common trend such that focusing on \"your community\" seems to be slightly more effective than focusing on \"you\", \"your family\" and \"your country\", but none of the pairwise comparisons were statistically significant (only the one vs. \"your family\" was marginally significant).",

Specifically, Jordan et al. found that focusing on \"your community\" promotes intentions to engage in preventive behaviors compared to the \"baseline\" (as we also do) and compared to focusing on \"you\" (in our case we find a non-significant trend). Our design differs from Jordan et al.'s in two regards. First, in their experiment, participants do not only read a message but are also shown a flier, which might have contributed to increase the size of the effect. The second difference regards the dependent variable: Jordan et al. (2020) use a set of prevention measures (handwashing, avoid touching one's own face, etc.) that is disjoint from our set of measures. Therefore, it is also possible that Jordan et al.'s results simply do not extend to our measure. In any case, putting together our results and those of Jordan et al. (2020) we can conclude that focusing on \"your community\" promotes intentions to engage in several preventive behaviors compared to the baseline. This can be a useful recommendation for leaders and policy makers.",

This is true especially in counties where wearing a face covering is not mandatory. Indeed, in counties in which wearing the face covering is mandatory, gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering almost disappear. This suggests that making wearing a face covering mandatory has a larger effect on men than on women. Moreover, we found that gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering are mediated by the subjective likelihood to get the disease and by the subjective likelihood to get over it more easily than not, in case one gets it. In other words, the fact that men less than women intend to wear a face covering can be partly explained by the fact that men more than women believe that they will be relatively unaffected by the disease. This is particularly ironic because official statistics show that actually the coronavirus (COVID-19) impacts men more seriously than women. For example, 60% of the deaths are men (Cai, 2020; Chen et al. 2020 ).",

Moreover, negative emotions when wearing a face covering mediates gender differences in the intentions to wear a face covering. However, interestingly, gender differences in negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering does not seem to depend on whether wearing a face covering is mandatory. In other words, making the wear of a face covering mandatory changes the self-reported intentions to wear a face covering, but not the self-reported emotions felt when wearing it. Moreover, we found that the self-reported negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering were not mediated by the likelihood to get the disease and by the likelihood to get over it easily in case one gets it. We also conducted some exploratory analyses to test in which specific items of the \"negative emotions felt when wearing a face covering\" scale the gender differences were concentrated. We found that men more than women disagree with the statement \"wearing a face covering is cool\" and agree with the statements: \"wearing a face covering is not cool\" \"wearing a face covering is shameful\", \"wearing a face covering is sign of weakness\", and \"the stigma attached to wearing a face covering is preventing [them] from wearing one as often as [they] should\". This suggests that future interventions to promote the use of a face covering among men can try to act on decreasing these negative emotions. More generally, future work can test whether priming the use of reason vs emotion (Levine et al. 2018; Capraro, Everett & Earp, 2019; Caviola & Capraro, 2020) can be effective at increasing intentions to use face covering among men.",
