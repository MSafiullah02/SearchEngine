Disulfide bonds can form between cysteines within the same polypeptide chain (intramolecular disulfide bond) or between cysteines on different polypeptide chains (intermolecular disulfide bond). The formation of disulfide bonds requires oxidation of the constituent cysteine residues. Once formed disulfide bonds are not chemically inert, they can be reduced back to their constituent cysteine residues. Although disulfide bonds are clearly important structurally, there is increasing evidence that they can be reduced under certain physiological conditions and that this can affect the activity of the protein itself with downstream functional consequences. In this review we discuss how these redox events may be important in regulating the immune system and we review recent data on the characterisation of membrane proteins that contain labile disulfide bonds.",

Some disulfide bonds have a catalytic role notably in thioredoxin and protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). In addition other disulfide bonds can be reduced and these can lead to changes in protein structure and have been termed \u2018allosteric\u2019. The disulfide bonds themselves are heterogeneous in geometry and this is discussed in detail by Schmidt et al. 1 who studied the geometry of about 7000 disulfide bonds from known structures. In this review we use term labile to describe those disulfide bonds that can be reduced under physiological conditions. It seems likely that they will cause conformational changes but, in the absence of such data, we use the simple term \u2018labile\u2019 meaning easy to break. Recent screening studies have shown that a surprisingly large number of different membrane proteins have labile disulfide bonds that can be reduced by mild reducing conditions in vitro and that many are reduced in vivo during inflammation 2. The proteins identified include integrins, adhesion proteins, cytokine and chemokine receptors, Ag receptors and transporters.",

For example, activation of DCs leads to the production of free extracellular cysteine 8, in vivo immunisation leads to increased free thiol production and induction of thioredoxin expression in lymphoid organs 9 and levels of extracellular thioredoxin are increased in lung injury 10. Enzymes such as the PDI members are generally associated with the ER where they assist in the proper folding of proteins but they are also found in other locations such as the cell surface, the extracellular space, the cytosol and the nucleus 4. Localisation of PDI and related proteins on the cell surface or the extracellular space can cause the reduction of labile disulfide bonds in membrane proteins, which may be important for viral infection, disease or cell signalling 4, 5.

Free thiols in the F gp, which are required for virus entry into the cell 30, are only present after binding of the virus to the target cell surface 31. This suggests that labile disulfide bonds are reduced before major conformational changes in the F protein occur and before activation by HN. How the appearance of free thiols influences F protein activation or conformational changes is as yet unknown 30. The enzyme responsible for catalysing the reduction of disulfide bonds in F protein is likely to be PDI due to the observation that membrane\u2010impermeable inhibitors of PDI (DTNB, bacitracin and anti\u2010PDI Ab) could suppress the formation of free thiols and inhibit virus entry 30.

Blocking the XC\n\u2013 transporter, for example, prevents cysteine accumulation in DCs indicating the importance of cystine uptake by the DCs and secretion of cysteine 36.

In one case a labile disulfide bond was identified in CD132 (see Fig. 2), the common gamma chain of several cytokine receptors, which on reduction prevented IL\u20102 signalling 39. Signalling of other cytokine receptors seems likely to be affected 40 with possible additional effects on cytokines as well as IL\u20104 has a labile disulfide that leads to loss of activity upon reduction 41. The implication is that the effects of the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines may be ameliorated by the redox changes resulting from the inflammatory response itself \u2013 a feedback control mechanism. It seems likely that other cytokine/chemokine interactions are affected by redox conditions. For example, thioredoxin affects the chemokine\u2010induced chemotaxis of eosinophils although the molecular basis for this is unclear 42. A different type of cytokine is the high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) that is both a nuclear protein that regulates transcription and a secreted protein demonstrating extracellular inflammatory cytokine activity.

There are extensive data to suggest that platelet activation is associated with an increase in the extracellular redox potential and several PDI family members come to the cell surface 59, 60, 61. A key protein that can be modulated by reduction is the fibrinogen receptor, integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23. This is the most abundant integrin on the platelet surface and its activation leads to increased binding of adhesive ligands such as fibrinogen, fibronectin and von Willebrand factor which in turn promote thrombus formation 59. The \u03b2 subunit of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 contains 56 highly conserved cysteine residues which all form disulfide bonds 62. Interestingly, the active state of \u03b1IIb\u03b23 seems to be attained by the reduction of cysteines within the EGF\u2010like domains \u03b1IIb\u03b23\n63.

Integrins are unusual in containing disulfide bonds not only in the extracellular domains but also in their intracellular part and mutagenesis of the latter can also affect ligand binding 66. The binding capacity of integrins can be modulated by various stimuli and the underlying concept is that the disulfide bonds maintain the integrin in a less active form (Fig. 3). This is evidenced by the finding that cysteine mutations and the addition of reducing agents result in increased ligand binding 67, 68, 69 and, more recently, a PDI inhibitor was shown to block thrombus formation 70. In addition to the fibrinogen receptor integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23, other platelet surface proteins are known to have increased levels of free thiols, such as the P2Y12 ADP receptor, gp Ib adhesion receptor \u03b1 (GPIb\u03b1) and the gp VI collagen receptor (GPVI) on platelet activation 59.
