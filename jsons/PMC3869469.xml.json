This approach to using nasopharyngeal swabs to collect deep nasal samples was previously found to be well accepted by participants in a study of respiratory viruses in CF patients at our hospital [2]. Next, a polyurethane foam NS (Super Brush, LLC, Chicopee, MA; catalog No. 71-4541) was collected in the opposite naris after instillation of saline nasal spray. Nasal spray was used to closely replicate a standard nasal wash. In brief, 5 sprays of saline from a polyethylene metered bottle (0.1 mL/spray) were instilled into the naris, followed by NS insertion into the anterior naris as far as comfortably possible, and rotation of the swab while exhaling through the nose for 5\u20137 seconds. During the clinic visit, the research nurse instructed the patient regarding self-collection of foam NS, and either the patient or parent collected the swab while observed and directed by the research nurse, or the swab was collected by the research nurse as an opportunity to demonstrate the proper technique for collection to the patient and parent. Detailed written instructions regarding self-collection were reviewed at the clinic visit and were provided to the family for reference when swab collection at home was indicated (see Supplementary Material). Also provided were kits containing all supplies necessary for collection and mailing of foam NS to be obtained at home at onset of symptoms of a new respiratory illness. Subsequent collections at home consisted of foam NS collected either by the participant or parent with (\u201csaline\u201d) and without (\u201cdry\u201d) the use of nasal saline spray to evaluate whether the spray was essential to the procedure, as previously described [25]. Dry swabs were collected by inserting a foam swab into the anterior naris as far as comfortably possible, followed by slow rotation of the swab for 5\u20137 seconds while exhaling through the nose. For home collections, participants were asked to collect the dry swab before the saline swab.",

The high proportion of swabs positive for rhinovirus may simply reflect the high frequency of rhinoviruses detected in nonmedically attended acute respiratory illness. However, it is important to note that the home-collected swabs did detect a variety of important respiratory viruses, in addition to rhinovirus. Although it is has been documented that children with CF shed respiratory viruses even in the absence of symptoms [2, 8, 14], the increased detection of viruses in home-collected samples in the setting of new respiratory illness suggests that this method is useful to detect incident viral infections.",

Using RT-PCR CT values as a semiquantitative evaluation of viral load for rhinoviruses detected, we found a difference in viral load between swabs collected in clinic versus home. The nearly 3.8 CT difference between mean CT values likely represents at least a 10-fold greater viral load in home-collected compared with clinic-collected swabs.",

Studies involving home self-collection of respiratory samples will provide more accurate data on the incidence of respiratory virus infections among children with CF and will help to elucidate the role of viral infections in chronic bacterial colonization and pulmonary function decline in CF lung disease. Because CF patients are generally followed at quarterly clinic visits, home sample collection could provide critical interim data regarding respiratory virus infections that might otherwise go undocumented. Home collection of samples could also prove useful for clinical management of patients with CF, providing more prompt recognition of these infections and potentially decreasing unnecessary or prolonged antibiotic use. Thus, we recommend this approach for future studies of respiratory illness and pulmonary exacerbations in patients with CF.",
