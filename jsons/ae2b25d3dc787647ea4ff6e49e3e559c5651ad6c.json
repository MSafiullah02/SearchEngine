Despite ongoing efforts, antiviral drugs to treat many of the most troubling viruses have not been approved yet. The recent launch of new antimicrobials is generating hope as more and more pathogens around the world become resistant to available drugs. But extra effort is still needed. One of the current strategies for antiviral and antibiotic drug development is the search for host cellular pathways used by many different pathogens. For example, many viruses and bacteria alter lipid synthesis and transport to build their own organelles inside infected cells. The characterization of these interactions will be fundamental to identify new targets for antiviral and antibiotic drug development. This review discusses how viruses and bacteria subvert cell machineries for lipid synthesis and transport and summarises the most promising compounds that interfere with these pathways.",

Both DNA and RNA viruses usurp and take advantage of cellular membranes at different steps of their replication cycle. Viruses are able to induce the synthesis of new membranes and reorganise membranes of cell compartments to generate new organelles known as replication organelles or viral factories, which support viral genome replication and assembly of virus progeny. The use of membranes from organelles of the secretory pathway is quite widespread among RNA viruses. For instance, flaviviruses such as dengue virus (DENV), West Nile virus (WNV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV; Gillespie, Hoenen, Morgan, & Mackenzie, 2010; Romero-Brey et al., 2012; Welsch et al., 2009) , reoviruses (Tenorio et al., 2018) , and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Knoops et al., 2008) *These two authors are equal contributors. exploit endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes.

Compounds that interfere with these pathways and have antiviral or antibiotic activity are indicated. (1) Listeria uses the InIB effector, which engages with host receptor Met and stimulates the recruitment of PI3KI to the bacterial entry sites. PI3K activation produces PI(3,4,5)P3, resulting in the reorganisation of cytoskeleton favouring the entry of Listeria. Both Listeria and Chlamydia additionally recruit PI4KII\u03b1/\u03b2 to the plasma membrane, where it produces PI(4)P also promoting uptake. (2) Brucella and Salmonella require PI3KI recruitment and activity for entering the cell. Alternately, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Shigella need the subsequent PI3K-AKT pathway to delay apoptosis. Moreover, Shigella's entry site requires an enrichment of PI(5)P stimulated by IpgD. (3) After entry, Chlamydia recruits PI4KII\u03b1 to the inclusion, generating PI(4)P and leading to the recruitment of the lipid transfer protein oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP). (4) Mycobacterium produces the mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) to interfere with PI3KIII activity. Disruption of PI3KIII reduces the amounts of PI(3)P on the inclusion surface and avoids phagosomal maturation. (5) Recruitment of PI4KIII\u03b2 and OCRL1 together with the hijacking of the secretory pathway enriches Legionella inclusion in PI(4)P. (6) The Salmonella effector SopB recruits PI3KIII to the inclusion surface to maintain high levels of PI(3)P. The SseL effector binds to OSBP, which is recruited to the inclusion periphery. (7) Many different viruses recruit and exploit host PI4KIII kinases to build viral factories within reorganised cell membranes. Hepatitis C virus and encephalomyocarditis virus remodel endoplasmic reticulum membranes to build replication organelles with the assistance of PI4KIII\u03b1 that generates PI(4)P at the replication sites. In a similar manner, PI4KIII\u03b2 is used by other viruses such as picornaviruses, enteroviruses, Coxsackievirus B3, and human rhinoviruses 2.1.2 | Regulation of lipid rafts and cholesterol synthesis",

In fact, many viruses are sensitive to inhibitors of HMGCR, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. This is the case of statins used for treating hypercholesterolaemia in humans. Statins act by competitively inhibiting HMGCR. Because their molecular structure is similar to HMG-CoA, statins fit into the catalytic active site of the enzyme and compete with the native substrate. This competition reduces the rate by which HMGCR produces mevalonate, the next molecule in the cascade that eventually generates cholesterol (Stancu & Sima, 2001) .

Chlamydia has developed different strategies to incorporate lipids via vesicular and nonvesicular transport (Hackstadt, Scidmore, & Rockey, 1995; Hatch & McClarty, 1998; Wylie, Hatch, & McClarty, 1997) . Cholesterol depletion with M\u03b2CD (Jutras, Abrami, & Dautry-Varsat, 2003; Korhonen et al., 2012) , simvastatin (Erkkila et al., 2005) , U18666A (Beatty, 2006) , and an acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor (Peters & Byrne, 2015) have shown that elementary bodies, the extracellular infectious stage of Chlamydia, attaches to cholesterol-rich sites at the plasma membrane. However, the importance of lipid rafts in Chlamydia entry is a matter of controversy because some studies have shown that Chlamydia can enter cells in a way that does not depend on lipid rafts (Gabel, Elwell, van Ijzendoorn, & Engel, 2004; Norkin, Wolfrom, & Stuart, 2001) . Contradictory results can be attributed to studies with various bacterial isolates and different host cells.",

C. burnetii has been shown to be sensitive to the treatment with statins (Howe & Heinzen, 2006) . Mycobacterium and Salmonella do not need lipid rafts for entry, but intracellular cholesterol is important for infection. As mentioned above, Mycobacterium cannot synthesize cholesterol and needs to obtain cholesterol from the host through alternative means such as the mce4 gene cluster and the ABC-like-ATP-dependent system that import cholesterol into bacteria. Disrupting cholesterol metabolism diminishes Mycobacterium entry (Kaul, Anand, & Verma, 2004 ), replication (de Chastellier & Thilo, 2006 Miner, Chang, Pandey, Sassetti, & Sherman, 2009; Mohn et al., 2008; Parihar et al., 2014; Russell, Cardona, Kim, Allain, & Altare, 2009) , and subsequent stages of infection (Nesbitt et al., 2010; Pandey & Sassetti, 2008) . Salmonella uses the pathogenicity island 1 and 2 type III secretion systems that localize in the lumen of the inclusion, where they mediate the esterification of cholesterol (Haraga, Ohlson, & Miller, 2008; Nawabi, Catron, & Haldar, 2008) .

Mycobacterium avoids this host defence via PI signalling. Thus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis synthesizes glycosylated phosphoinositides such as mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM; Beatty et al., 2000; Fratti, Chua, Vergne, & Deretic, 2003) . Furthermore, the phosphatase activity of SapM, MptpB, and MptpA reduces the amount of PtdIns (3) P on the Mycobacterium-containing vacuole surface (Chua & Deretic, 2004) . Both ManLAM and phosphatase effectors interfere with phagosomal maturation and degradation of bacteria (Castandet et al., 2005; Singh et al., 2003) . Interestingly, Asm is also important for Mycobacterium infection. Pharmacological inhibition of Asm with imipramine (Godbole et al., 2015) and infection in Asm-deficient mice (Utermohlen, Herz, Schramm, & Kronke, 2008) showed that the growth of M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Mycobacterium avium was blocked. Moreover, Asm-deficient mice were more resistant to Mycobacterium lethal infection than wild-type mice. Additionally, both Neisseria and Pseudomonas trigger Asm activation, Cer release, and the assembly of Cer-enriched rafts that are essential for infection (Grassme et al., 1997; Grassme et al., 2003; Hauck et al., 2000) . Cer-enriched platforms serve as scaffold for the recruitment of cellular receptors such as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, used by Pseudomonas to enter cells (Schroeder et al., 2002) . Deficiency of Asm and specific pharmacological inhibition blocked Neisseria (Grassme et al., 1997; Hauck et al., 2000; Simonis, Hebling, Gulbins, Schneider-Schaulies, & Schubert-Unkmeir, 2014) and and E. coli (Falcone et al., 2004) , demonstrating their potential as broad-spectrum antibiotics.",

Brucella also requires both PI3KI and PI3KII activity for entering the cell and replicate (Guzman-Verri et al., 2001) . Salmonella can modulate PIderived signalling at different stages of infection via the bacterial phosphatase effector SopB. By a not well-understood SopBdependent process, PI3KI converts PI(4,5)P2 to PI(3,4,5)P3 at the plasma membrane and produces a double effect: First, the reduction of interactions between membrane and cytoskeleton leads to bacterial invasion (Terebiznik et al., 2002) , and second, the recruitment of AKT activates cell survival pathways that avoid apoptosis. SopB also reduces PI(4,5)P2 and PS levels on the Salmonella vacuole surface, where charge diminishes avoiding the fusion with lysosomes (Bakowski et al., 2010) . Another essential SopB function for Salmonella replication is the recruitment of Rab5 and PI3KIII to the inclusion surface, which is required to maintain high levels of PI(3)P (Bujny et al., 2008; Hernandez, Hueffer, Wenk, & Galan, 2004) .",

In contrast, Mycobacterium alters PI(3)P levels by a dual strategy. Mycobacterium encodes different phosphatase effectors to arrest phagosomal maturation and avoid its elimination by reducing the amount of PI(3)P on the Mycobacterium inclusion surface (Castandet et al., 2005; Singh et al., 2003) . Mycobacterium also expresses a glycosylated PI analogue, the ManLAM, that inhibits the activation of PI3KIII, the kinase involved in PI(3)P production.",

Chlamydia recruits PI4KII\u03b1, has high levels of PI4P in the membrane inclusion, and recruits the lipid transfer protein OSBP in a PI4P-dependent way.

Lipids are gaining importance as targets for antiviral and antibiotic development. Because many viruses and bacteria use lipids to build neo-organelles for replication and persistence, inhibitors of the synthesis of cholesterol, Cer, SLs, FAs, and phospholipids interfere with growth of many pathogens. Besides, drugs against protein kinases target signalling pathways needed for infection. Figures 1   and 2 summarise current knowledge on host lipid synthesis, transport, and signalling pathways used by viruses and bacteria. Compounds that interfere with these pathways may become efficient antivirals or antibiotics. Moreover, drugs tested against viruses might be efficient also against bacteria and vice versa. Notably, targeting lipid transport may produce less toxic antivirals and antibiotics as intracellular pathogens depend on specific LTPs for making their neo-organelles, although cells may have more than one LTP for the same function. Within this context, high-throughput screening of clinically tested compounds will provide a rapid means to identify undiscovered, antiviral, and antibiotic functions for well-characterized molecules that target lipid metabolism and flows.

Membrane-associated viral replication is closely related to lipid synthesis and transport. Viruses generally subvert lipid flows by three different mechanisms: the translocation and/or regulation of lipid biosynthesis enzymes, the interference with lipid-mediated signalling through the regulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinases, and the regulation of lipid trafficking at membrane contact sites (MCSs)between adjacent organelles. Here, we present the current knowledge on these pathways and a list of drugs that interfere with them and have been identified to exhibit antiviral capacity (summarised inFigures 1 and 2).",

            "text": "For some arboviruses, cholesterol plays an important role in the process of virus entry into cells. For example, the Gc structural protein of Rift Valley fever virus directly recognises and binds to GPLs at the plasma membrane. Insertion of Gc is followed by accumulation of cholesterol and local membrane reorganisation (Guardado-Calvo et al., 2017). Depletion of cholesterol and consequent disruption of lipid rafts by methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\u03b2CD) decreased the infectivity of Newcastle disease virus, WNV, HCV, and bovine parainfluenza virus, mainly through blocking virus entry into cells (Kapadia, Barth, Baumert, McKeating, & Chisari, 2007; Li, Yu, & Hou, 2017; Mackenzie, Khromykh, & Parton, 2007; Martin, Holguera, Sanchez-Felipe, Villar, & Munoz-Barroso, 2012). During influenza A and syncitial virus infections, a similar effect has been observed after treatment with gemfribrozil (Bajimaya, Frankl, Hayashi, & Takimoto, 2017) and with a natural elder fruit extract (Shahsavandi et al., 2017).Cholesterol, PI 4-phosphate (PI4P), and PE concentrate also in membranes of VRCs. VRCs of poliovirus, rhinovirus, and Coxsackievirus B3 accumulate cholesterol(Hsu et al., 2010;Ilnytska et al., 2013;Roulin et al., 2014). To facilitate viral genome replication, WNV modulates host cholesterol homeostasis by redistributing cholesterol-synthesizing enzymes and cellular cholesterol to replication sites(Mackenzie et al., 2007). Moreover, characteristic highlycurved nanoperiodic cubic membranes imaged by electron microscopy in cells infected by several (+)ssRNA viruses belonging to the Coronaviridae, Picornaviridae, Togaviridae, and Flaviviridae families are thought to be linked to changes in cell cholesterol metabolism through activation of cellular 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase or HMGCR; Deng, Almsherqi, Ng, & Kohlwein, 2010).",

Twenty SM molecules interact with a specific binding domain in the structure of HCV RdRp and change the conformation of its catalytic pocket leading to RNA recruitment and replication(Weng et al., 2010).Inhibition of different enzymes that mediate SL biosynthesis decreases infectivity of different viruses. De novo synthesis of SLs initiates at the ER with the synthesis of sphinganine from palmitoyl-CoA and serine by the enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase. Three inhibitors of serine palmitoyltransferase have been described to present antiviral activity against HCV, hepatitis B virus, and WNV: ISP-1, myriocin, and NA255 (Aizaki et al., 2008; Aktepe, Pham, & Mackenzie, 2015; Amemiya et al., 2008; Sakamoto et al., 2005; Tatematsu, Tanaka, Sugiyama, Sudoh, & Mizokami, 2011; Weng et al., 2010). Then, sphinganine is acylated and transformed into Cer by the Cer synthase. Cer is then delivered to the Golgi complex, where it is converted into SM by the SM synthase or into complex glycosphingolipids by the uridine diphosphate-glucose Cer synthase. Pharmacological inhibition of SM synthase with D609, SPK-601, and MS-209 or inhibition of uridine diphosphate-glucose Cer synthase by N-Butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DMJ) and D,Lthreo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP), respectively, reduced the infectivity of HCV and WNV (Khan et al., 2014; Martin-Acebes et al., 2016). Inhibition of Cer synthase by fumonisin B1 also impairs WNV replication (Aktepe et al., 2015). As observed, viruses of the Flaviviridae have been found to be the most sensitive to SL biosynthesis blockage. Other lipid biosynthetic enzymes have been associated with viral infections. For example, HCV takes advantage of three lipid synthesis enzymes, which are related to the biogenesis and maintenance of cellular lipid droplets (LDs). LDs are dynamic organelles enriched in triglycerides and cholesterol esters that regulate the storage and hydrolysis of neutral lipids and participate in lipid energy balance and signalling, cell immunity, protein storage, and trafficking (Welte, 2015). After replication, HCV proteins are targeted to LD, where virus assembly takes place. Pharmacological inhibition of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1, and acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase results in the blockade of virion assembly and egress (Herker et al., 2010; Liefhebber, Hague, Zhang, Wakelam, & McLauchlan, 2014). Targeting synthesis of lipids stored at LDs might be an alternative for therapeutic treatment of chronic HCV",

            "text": "PI4PIII\u03b1 and PI4PIII\u03b2. Many different viruses exploit host PI4KIII kinases. For example, HCV, some enteroviruses, and picornaviruses stimulate PI4 kinases to generate PI4P in situ at replication sites. This local increase of PI4P has significant impact on membrane remodelling, assembly of VRCs, and viral genome replication. HCV nonstructural protein NS5A and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) nonstructural protein 3A recruit and activate PI4KIII\u03b1 (Dorobantu et al., 2015; Reiss et al., 2011). However, enteroviruses use their 3A nonstructural protein to recruit PI4KIII\u03b2 to VRCs (Hsu et al., 2010).PI4KIII\u03b2 is a specific target of protein kinase inhibitors such as enviroxime-like compounds. Enviroxime, GW5074, and T-00127-HEV are used as antipoliovirus compounds(Arita et al., 2011), and other synthetic enviroxime-related compounds as GSK2998533A and BF738735(Arita et al., 2011;Roulin et al., 2014) are broadspectrum antivirals against different enteroviruses.On the other hand, pharmacological inhibition of PI4KIII\u03b1 by AL-9 decreases infectivity of Saffold virus 3, EMCV, and HCV(Dorobantu   et al., 2015). Tyrphostin AG1478, a known epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor and an anticancer chemotherapy agent, also inhibits PI4KIII\u03b1 activity in both in vitro and cell cultures and impairs replication of EMCV and HCV(Dorobantu et al., 2016).",

Transport of cholesterol by OSBP is highly dependent on PI4KIII activity and PI4P levels at Golgi membranes. PI4KIIIs synthesize PI4P on the surface of Golgi membranes, and PI4P lipids serve as an anchor for OSBP, which drives transport and accumulation of cholesterol.Different viruses belonging to the Picornaviridae family such as enterovirus, poliovirus, and EMCV, as well as HCV, another positive stranded nonrelated virus, use the so-called PI4KIII-PI4P-OSBP pathway(Arita, 2014;van der Schaar et al., 2016).Due to the observation that deleting OSBP does not compromise cellular viability, most probably because other redundant LTPs could make up for its function, the interest in studying OSBP as a target for broad-spectrum antivirals has grown. To date, three different drugs have been developed for specifically inhibiting OSBP. Itraconazole, OSW-1, and TTP-8307 bind to the OSBP hydrophobic pocket and compete with cholesterol. They have been successfully tested against enterovirus, EMCV, and HCV(Albulescu et al., 2015; Albulescu et al.,   2017;Strating et al., 2015;Wang et al., 2014).",

Under pathological and cellular stress situations, PS molecules are flipped and exposed on the cell surface, serving like an alert flag for detection by the immune system. PS exposure has been linked to apoptosis, infections, and cancer(Birge et al., 2016).PS anionic lipids are present in the membranes of many enveloped RNA viruses, including DENV, WNV, chikungunya, Ebola, Lassa fever virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and DNA viruses such as vaccinia. PS-enriched envelopes of viruses are recognised by such as Ebola and Lassa fever viruses in in vitro assays and in small animal models (Dowall et al., 2015; Soares et al., 2008). The molecular mechanism by which PS is accumulated into viral budding sites in not yet well understood. Recently, the OSBP-related proteins ORP5 and ORP8 have been shown to facilitate the PS/PI4P exchange at ER-plasma membrane MCSs (Chung et al., 2015).Another study suggests that the phospholipid scramblase-1, a calcium-responsive enzyme that flips PS between membrane leaflets, might participate in PS extracellular exposure in cells infected with herpes virus. Inhibition of phospholipid scramblase-1 with its antagonist R5421 prevents the virus-induced exposure of PS on the cell surface and reduces virus infection(Cheshenko, Pierce, & Herold, 2018).",

The plasma membrane is enriched in PI(4,5)P2 and PI(4)P, phagosomes and early endosomes are enriched in PI(3)P, and multivesicular bodies and late endosomes contain PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2. Bacteria subvert PtdIns flows by encoding enzymes, principally phosphatases, and by altering the expression or localization of host proteins that modulate PI intracellular levels. The presence of different species of lipids on the surface of bacterial inclusions creates an optimal micro-environment for recruiting specific proteins, shooting signalling cascades, and avoiding cellular defences.",
