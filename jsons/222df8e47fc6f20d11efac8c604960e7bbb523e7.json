            "text": "Building accurate knowledge of the identity, the geographic distribution and the evolution of species is essential for the sustainable development of humanity, as well as for biodiversity conservation. However, the difficulty of identifying plants and animals in the field is hindering the aggregation of new data and knowledge. Identifying and naming living plants or animals is almost impossible for the general public and is often difficult even for professionals and naturalists. Bridging this gap is a key step towards enabling effective biodiversity monitoring systems. The LifeCLEF campaign, presented in this paper, has been promoting and evaluating advances in this domain since 2011. The 2020 edition proposes four data-oriented challenges related to the identification and prediction of biodiversity: (i) PlantCLEF: cross-domain plant identification based on herbarium sheets, (ii) BirdCLEF: bird species recognition in audio soundscapes, (iii) GeoLifeCLEF: location-based prediction of species based on environmental and occurrence data, and (iv) Snake-CLEF: image-based snake identification.",

Unfortunately, observing and identifying living organisms requires high levels of expertise. For instance, plants alone account for more than 400,000 different species and the distinctions between them can be quite subtle. Since the Rio Conference of 1992, this taxonomic gap has been recognized as one of the major obstacles to the global implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity [6] . In 2004, Gaston and O'Neill [27] discussed the potential of automated approaches for species identification. They suggested that, if the scientific community were able to (i) produce large training datasets, (ii) precisely evaluate error rates, (iii) scale up automated approaches, and (iv) detect novel species, then it would be possible to develop a generic automated species identification system that would open up new vistas for research in biology and related fields.",

This area continues to expand rapidly, particularly due to recent advances in deep learning [25, 28, 31, 42, [45] [46] [47] . In order to measure progress in a sustainable and repeatable way, the LifeCLEF [15] research platform was created in 2014 as a continuation and extension of the plant identification task [37] that had been run within the ImageCLEF lab [12] since 2011 [32] [33] [34] . LifeCLEF expanded the challenge by considering animals in addition to plants, and including audio and video content in addition to images. LifeCLEF 2020 consists of four challenges (PlantCLEF, BirdCLEF, GeoLifeCLEF, and SnakeCLEF), which we will now describe in turn.",

            "text": "Motivation: Monitoring birds by sound is important for many environmental and scientific purposes. Birds are difficult to photograph and sound offers better possibilities for inventory coverage. A number of participatory science projects have focused on recording a very large number of bird sounds, making it possible to recognize most species by their sound and to train deep learning models to automate this process. It was shown in previous editions of BirdCLEF [35, 36] that systems for identifying birds from mono-directional recordings are now performing very well and several mobile applications implementing this are emerging today. However, there is also interest in identifying birds from omnidirectional or binaural recordings. This would enable more passive monitoring scenarios like networks of static recorders that continuously capture the surrounding sound environment. The advantage of this type of approach is that it introduces less sampling bias than the opportunistic observations of citizen scientists. However, recognizing birds in such content is much more difficult due to the high vocal activity with signal overlap (e.g. during the dawn chorus) and high levels of ambient noise. Task Description: In 2020, two scenarios will be evaluated: (i) the recognition of all specimens singing in a long sequence (up to one hour) of raw soundscapes that can contain tens of birds singing simultaneously, and (ii) chorus source separation in complex soundscapes that were recorded in stereo at very high sampling rate (250 kHz SR). For the first scenario, participants will be asked to provide time intervals of recognized singing birds. Participants will be allowed to use any of the provided metadata complementary to the audio content (.wav format, 44.1 kHz, 48 kHz, or 96 kHz sampling rate). The task is focused on developing real-world applicable solutions and therefore requires participants to submit single models trained on none other than the mono-species recordings provided as training data. For the second task on stereophonic recordings, the goal will be to determine the species singing in chorus simultaneously during a time interval. In contrast to task one, the challengers are invited to run automatic source separation before or jointly to the bird species classification, taking advantage of the multi-channel recordings. Participants will be allowed to use any other data than the provided recordings, but will have to provide the scripts to check that their solution is fully automatic. For both tasks, the evaluation measure will be the classification mean average precision (c-mAP, [39] ).",

More generally, this could facilitate biodiversity inventories through the development of location-based recommendation services (e.g. on mobile phones), encourage the involvement of citizen scientist observers, and accelerate the annotation and validation of species observations to produce large, high-quality data sets.
