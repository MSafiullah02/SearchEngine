            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is a vector-borne human pathogen that usually causes dengue fever; however, sometime it leads to deadly complications such as dengue with warning signs (DWS+) and severe dengue (SD). Several studies have shown that fusion (Fu) and bc loop of DENV envelope domain II are highly conserved and consist some of the most dominant antigenic epitopes. Therefore, in this study, Fu and bc loops were joined together to develop a short recombinant protein as an alternative of whole DENVenvelope protein, and its immunogenic potential as fusion peptide was estimated. For de novo designing of the antigen, Fu and bc peptides were linked with an optimised linker so that the three dimensional conformation was maintained as it is in DENV envelope protein. The redesigned Fubc protein was expressed in E. coli and purified. Subsequently, structural integrity of the purified protein was verified by CD spectroscopy. To characterise immune responses against recombinant Fubc protein, BALB/c mice were subcutaneously injected with emulsified antigen preparation. It was observed by ELISA that Fubc fusion protein elicited higher serum IgG antibody response either in the presence or in absence of Freund's adjuvant in comparison to the immune response of Fu and bc peptides separately. Furthermore, the binding of Fubc protein with mice antisera was validated by SPR analysis. These results suggest that Fu and bc epitope-based recombinant fusion protein could be a potential candidate towards the development of the effective subunit vaccine against DENV.",

            "text": "In the recent decades, dengue has emerged as one of the world's most dominant tropical diseases (Guzman et al. 2016) with around 390 million (95% credible interval 284 to 528 million) cases recorded per year, of which only 96 million (95% credible interval 67 to 136 million) cases were manifested clinically (Giraldo-Garc\u00eda and Casta\u00f1o-Osorio, 2019; Bhatt et al. 2013 ). According to World Health Organization (WHO), an estimate of 3.9 billion people in 128 countries are living in areas with a high risk of dengue infection (Brady et al. 2012 ). The recently estimated annual 390 million dengue cases reveals that the dengue disease burden has tripled as compared to previous predictions of 50 to 100 million reported cases without dengue warning signs. Nonetheless, 250,000 to 500,000 patients were hospitalised due to dengue with warning signs (DWS+) and severe dengue (SD), and the total annual cost of dengue burden was estimated globally around US$ 8.9 billion (Giraldo-Garc\u00eda and Casta\u00f1o-Osorio, 2019; Guzman et al. 2016) . In spite of having paucity of effective vaccines and drugs to expel dengue comprehensively, still it's enduring a big challenge to human (Martina et al. 2009 ). Therefore, next-generation vaccine strategies such as inactivated purified virus, DNA or protein-based subunit vaccines, and their fusion chimeras are now going under investigation and some of them even under clinical trials (Coller et al. 2011; Danko et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2015) .",

Several other vaccine candidates were also formulated based on live-attenuated dengue viruses (e.g. TV003, TV005) and inactivated purified virus (e.g. DPIV), of which some have already completed clinical trials and some are currently going under phase II to III clinical trials (Whitehead et al. 2017; Diaz et al. 2018 ).

            "text": "The dengue envelope (E) protein is composed of three ecto-domains, a membrane-proximal stem and a transmembrane anchor (Klein et al. 2013 ). Various crystal structures have shown that the ecto-domains are arranged into three antiparallel dimer on virus surface in a icosahedral symmetry, where ecto-domain I (EI) is located at the centre holding domain II (EDII) and III (EDIII) in two opposite sites in each of the monomer of a dimeric unit (Fibriansah et al. 2015; Kuhn et al. 2002; Modis et al. 2004 ). Most of the protective antibodies against dengue virus are identified to domain III, and initially were thought to be a potential subunit vaccine target (Murphy and Whitehead 2011; Sukupolvi-Petty et al. 2010) . Although, recombinant EDIII domain injected by plasmid DNA or purified from bacterial expression systems was found to be poorly immunogenic, and has shown low protective efficacy in animal model (Guzman et al. 2010 ). On the other hand, EDII has been reported as the dimerisation domain and consists of the most conserved fusion (Fu) and bc loop (Li et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2004 ). Several studies have also shown that the conserved Fu loop is highly immunogenic (Lai et al. 2008; Cherrier et al. 2009; Smith et al. 2013) , and induces cross-reactive antibodies, of which some are crosstalk with adjacent bc loop (Gallichotte et al., 2015; Cherrier et al. 2009 ). Moreover, during endocytosis, both of the loops are found to involve in tertiary conformation of membrane fusion (Nayak et al. 2009; Sukupolvi-Petty et al. 2010) . Therefore, it has been anticipated that both of the loops might have integrated role for boosting cross-neutralizing immunity.",

NHS activates the carboxymethyl groups by creating a highly reactive succinimide ester on the disc surface, which reacts with amine and other nucleophilic groups on proteins that subsequently help to bind the target protein on activated disc surface. Ethanolamine was added to block the remaining activated carboxymethyl group.

The structural details of truncated Fubc protein compare to whole envelope in dengue and Fu, and bc peptides were also analysed by modelling each of their three dimensional structure. It reveals that the presence of three anti-parallel \u03b2-strands and one disulphide linkage play a crucial role in preserving the three dimensional conformations of truncated Fubc protein same as in original DENV envelope protein (Fig. 1b, c) . Ironically, due to the absence of anti-parallel \u03b2-strands and a single protein frame of Fu and bc loops, these two separately expressed peptides fail to form similar three-dimensional conformation as in original DENV envelop (Fig. 1c) . The electrostatic and solvent accessible areas of Fubc truncated protein are also comparable with original dengue envelope. Hence, it is speculated that the recombinant Fubc protein would be an alternative vaccine target of whole dengue envelope. Fu loop is shown in orange and bc loop is shown in yellow. b in DENV envelope, the Fu and bc loops are present at the end of domain II and are linked by the di-sulphide linkage that holds both loops together to form a stable structure that can also work as an epitope. c When the structure of Fubc is compared to original DENV envelope, it is plausible that the presence of three anti-parallel \u03b2-strands present in Fubc protein (same as DENV protein) plays a crucial role in maintaining the three dimensional conformation of Fubc protein as it is in DENV protein. Another major factor that plays in conformation of Fu and bc loops is the disulphide linkage between the two highly conserved loop in the Fubc protein that ensures the same conformation of DENV envelope as it is shown in b and c, and d due to the lack of anti-parallel \u03b2-strands and same protein frame while these peptides are expressed separately, it is unlike to form di-sulphide linkage and fold in the same conformation as reside in DENV envelope and Fubc proteins",

The Fubc gene was then cloned into a TA cloning vector, and the clones were screened by colony PCR using Fubc gene specific end primers. Two positive clones were then confirmed by restriction digestion using EcoRI and XhoI enzymes (Fig.  S1a-d) .

Therefore, Fubc expression level was checked further by lowering growth temperature and IPTG concentration, but no significant change was noticed in supernatant fraction. Chaperone-assisted folding system did not help remarkably to express the Fubc recombinant protein in the soluble form. Therefore, the insoluble pellet fraction of Fubc protein was further utilised in mild solubilisation process to recover soluble Fubc protein. Initially, the recovered soluble Fubc protein fraction was purified by using Ni-NTA agarose beads, and the purified protein band was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (Fig. S3) . Although, Ni-NTA affinity chromatography has not revealed good purification quality and the yield was also not sufficient. Furthermore, gel filtration chromatography was used to recover good quality large-scale recombinant protein, and single distinct peak greater than 20 mAU was observed at approximately 20.57 ml position for all of injected Fubc protein samples (Fig. 2a) . After pooling together, the peak fractions were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE, and single bright band was observed at molecular weight 11.5 kDa (Fig. 2b) .",

And the formation of recombinant Fubc secondary structure was characterised here by negative bending at 208 nm and 222 nm wavelength (Kumagai et al. 2017) . The CD spectrum of recombinant Fubc protein has showed significantly decreased spectral peaks around 222 and 208 nm that signify the formation of \u03b2-sheet (Fig. 3 ). In addition, it was noticed that the acquired CD spectrum of Fubc at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 10 mM PBS buffer was adequately intense (Fig. 2) . Therefore, it can be inferred from Fig. 3 (lower panel) that Fubc at concentrations of 0.2 mg/mL and 0.1 mg/mL in 10 mM PBS retained the best globular folded state as compared to other conditions. Immune response to the purified Fubc protein in BALB/c mice From indirect ELISA, it was observed that the serum IgG levels in both male and female groups treated with Fubc proteins were significantly higher than those treated with only adjuvant and PBS control (Fig. 4a, b) . In addition, the response with only Fubc recombinant protein (without adjuvant) in the female group was also observed higher than their male counterpart group (Fig. 4b) . All of the ELISA data were also found statistically significant by two-way ANOVA (Table S1) . Similarly, by SPR assay, high level immune response was also observed for serum injected with recombinant Fubc protein along with adjuvant, and without any adjuvant, the response was also higher than the control (serum with PBS only) (Fig. 6b ).",

Due to the absence of highly specific neutralising antibodies in secondary infections, cross-reactive nonneutralising antibodies usually enhance the dengue severity (De Alwis et al. 2014 ). According to the revised dengue case classification (DENCO), 2 to 3% of secondary infections with another serotype causes life threating dengue with warning signs (DWS+) and severe dengue (SD). It was reported that serotype-cross-reactive non-neutralising antibodies enhance the entry of dengue genome into Fc receptor-bearing monocyte cells and promote disease severity by a process known as antibody-depended enhancement (ADE) Flipse et al. 2013) . That means nature of the antibody response to DENV is most likely to play a major role in defining disease outcome. Therefore, it is predictable that antibodies that recognise specific neutralizing epitopes help in virus clearance and reduce symptoms; however, antibodies that recognise non-neutralising epitopes lead to more severe forms of disease like DWS+/SD. Hence, there is an urgent need for an advanced vaccine which could generate highly specific and cross-neutralising antibody (Costin et al. 2013 ).",

The most advanced candidate, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV), was licenced in some of the dengue endemic countries (Imai and Ferguson 2018) . However, it was revealed risky in children or na\u00efve dengue patient with severe infection as they were vaccinated (Arredondo-Garc\u00eda et al. 2018) . Therefore, considering safety issues, production of recombinant subunit vaccine with efficient immune protective properties is looking attractive (Govindarajan et al. 2015) . Meanwhile, an admixture of four live attenuated recombinant dengue vaccine TV003/TV005 have completed Phase III clinical trial and licenced to several manufacturers including Butantan, VaBiotech and Merk (Whitehead et al. 2017) . Moreover, some recombinant tetravalent vaccines (e.g. DEN-80E, TVDV) expressing the prM and E genes of each of the four DENV serotypes from plasmid DNA, have already completed phase I clinical trial (Govindarajan et al. 2015; Danko et al. 2018 ). It has also been shown that the recombinant dengue envelope domain III can inhibit dengue infectivity, and induce dengue-neutralising immunoglobulin in mice (Hermida et al. 2006) . In addition, a number of antibodies which were raised in mice and Fig. 2 Purification of recombinant Fubc protein by size exclusion chromatography. a FPLC chromatogram of Fubc protein expressed in E. coli inclusion bodies.

Although, the hMABs specific to dengue domain II fusion loop were not found equally effective on other flaviviruses including WNV, YFV and other DENV strain (Costin et al. 2013) . Therefore, it was conjectured that adjacent to the fusion loop, additional contact residues of original domain II surface structure might be involved to raise cross-neutralizing antibodies.",

Our previous bioinformatics studies have also shown that the envelope of all DENV serotype consists of four conserved regions (> 90%), and two of them were found in domain II, in which one is fusion loop (Fu) with more than 99% conservation and another is its nearby bc loop (Fig. 1a ) .

            "text": "The very early challenge of subunit vaccine design is to produce large quantities of functional protein. Hereby, we have successfully optimised the expression and purification methods for the production of large-scale high-quality recombinant Fubc protein. The E. coli expression system was used here, and the recombinant protein was found to be expressed in higher quantity, though most of the protein was extracted initially in pellet fraction. No significant change was noticed by altering regular growth temperature and inducer concentration. Therefore, we have utilised the mild-solubilisation methodology to recover soluble Fubc protein from insoluble pellet protein. For purification, firstly, we have used convenient Ni- NTA affinity purification method, and by adjusting the lysis and elution buffer, we were able to purify recombinant Fubc protein to some extent but the quality and quantity was not sufficient. Finally, to scale up the quality protein production, size exclusion chromatography was used in AKTA FPLC system. To confirm the recombinant protein expression, simple western blot was performed by using anti-His monoclonal antibody as primary. Furthermore, in vitro structural integrity and functional authenticity of the experimental Fubc protein were also verified by CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3) and indirect ELISA (Fig. 4) . However, most of the hMABs identified earlier from dengue patient serum were predominantly cross-reactive and recognise epitopes containing highly conserved residues at the Fu loop of domain II (Lai et al. 2008 ). However, having such sequence homology in Fu loop of all flaviviruses, these hMABs are non-neutralizing against heterologous serotypes (Lai et al. 2008; Smith et al. 2013) and thus was found to be responsible for ADE in animals (Goncalvez et al. 2007 ). Previously, it has also been stated that this scenario might happen due to the cryptic nature and poor accessibility of the fusion loop epitope on the surface of the mature virion (Lai et al. 2008; Cherrier et al. 2009 ). However, in addition to the partially exposed fusion loop on immature flaviviruses, some neutralizing hMAbs were also found to bind with bc loop (Costin et al. 2013) . Therefore, it is suggestive that along with conserved fusion loop, adjacent less conserved linker sequence and bc loop might be required to be exposed as a whole to generate effective cross-neutralizing immunity. Our current mouse immunisation experiment also supports this idea as it was observed that the antibody response to full length Fubc protein was stronger than the response elicited by the Fu and Bc peptides in separate (Figs. 4 and 5) .",

            "text": "Moreover, without Freund's adjuvant, recombinant Fubc protein was found immunogenic, and the response in female mice was stronger than in male (Figs. 4 and 5) . These observations were also symmetrical with other studies where it was stated that female mice have a better immune response due to the higher number of leukocytes occupying the naive peritoneal and pleural cavities, and also have a number of T-and Blymphocytes as well as macrophages (Terres et al. 1968; Weinstein et al. 1984; Klein et al. 2015) . Therefore, we have used female mice serum samples for further qualitative ELISA and SPR test to quantify immune response of recombinant Fubc protein. It was noticed that IgG antibody response to Fu, and bc peptides were significantly lower than the response observed to Fubc recombinant protein, and the immune response achieved to Fu and Bc peptide with Freund's adjuvant was significantly higher as compared to the peptides without adjuvant and serum control (Fig. 5) . Two-way ANOVA was also performed to analyse the significance of IgG immune responses between Fubc + FA and Fubc without FA; Fu, bc Peptide + FA and Fu, bc Peptide without FA. From F values and P values obtained by ANOVA test, it can be interpreted that the difference between Fubc protein with Freund's adjuvant and Fu, bc Peptide with Freund's adjuvant were significantly higher than protein and peptides injected without Freund's adjuvant (Table S2) . Also, the IgG response to recombinant Fubc protein was recorded better than Fu and bc peptides in both cases either with or without adjuvant. In addition, the p value of IgG immune response between Fubc protein with FA and without FA was found insignificant (p = 0.1740 > 0.05) that suggests that Fubc without any adjuvant is sufficient to elicit significant immune response (Table S2) . Consistently, it was observed by SPR experiment that the refractive index of Fubc + FA was significantly higher than Fubc + without FA and serum control (Fig. 6b) .",

Due to the presence of highly conserved fusion loop epitope, overlapping less conserved linker sequences and also bc epitope, this fusion protein might induce cross-neutralisation immunity against heterologous dengue serotypes. Though, still a lot of investigations, like the evaluation of a proper adjuvant to induce robust immune response, the memory immune response generated against the Fubc protein both by humoral and cell-mediated immunity, and whether this memory response will provide protection against a secondary encounter with DENV, are required before going clinical trial. Nevertheless, the production process and immune response of this fusion protein would provide new insight for the development of dengue subunit vaccine.",
