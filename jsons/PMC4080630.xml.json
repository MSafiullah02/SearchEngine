To prevent influenza, the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) has been widely used. While TIV can prevent influenza illness in up to 80% of healthy adults (<65 years of age) [2], their efficacy can be very low in years when influenza strains in the vaccine are not matched with circulating viruses due to antigenic drift and shift. Thus, generation of cross-reactive antibodies is important for developing a better influenza vaccine. In addition, TIV is not effective in the aged population; the protection rate in the elderly (\u226565 years) can be as low as 30\u201340% even when the vaccine-induced antibodies are specific for the circulating influenza strain [2].",

Adjuvants have also been shown to enhance cross-reactive responses [3]. Furthermore, enhancement of immune responses by adjuvants can allow for antigen sparing, i.e., use of a lower dose of antigen that is still effective. Use of smaller amounts of antigen reduces vaccine cost, and more importantly allows more people to receive the vaccine when supply of vaccine antigen is limited [4], [5]. This is particularly relevant for influenza vaccines since its production in eggs is a long process (6 months) that cannot meet a sudden demand for large quantity of vaccine during an outbreak or pandemic.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that recombinant Ov-ASP-1 (rOv-ASP-1) is a powerful immunostimulatory adjuvant using ovalbumin, HIV-1 polypeptide, SARS-CoV peptide and subunit antigens, and several commercially available vaccines [14], [15], [16], [17]. It promotes a balanced Th1/Th2 antibody response and a Th1-biased cellular response to several vaccine antigens [14], [15]. In this study, we have demonstrated in a mouse model that rOv-ASP-1 not only substantially enhanced the magnitude of the specific antibody response after immunization with low doses of influenza vaccine, but also accelerated the antibody responses. Furthermore, rOv-ASP-1 significantly enhanced both cross-reactive antibody responses and protection against challenge with an antigenically distinct strain. Our results demonstrate that rOv-ASP-1 is a promising adjuvant that can be used with inactivated influenza vaccine, enabling both vaccine antigen sparing and enhanced protection against influenza infection.",

It strongly promotes a Th2-type, but not a Th1-type, associated antibody response [7], [26], [27]. Our results above show that rOv-ASP-1 enhances predominantly the Th1-type IgG2c response. Importantly, a recent study suggested that the Th1 response induced by influenza vaccine plays a more important role in protection against influenza [28]. Therefore, we compared the abilities of rOv-ASP-1 and alum to enhance the Th1 (IgG2c) and Th2 (IgG1) antibody responses after immunization with TIV. B6 mice were immunized with TIV + rOv-ASP-1 or TIV + alum; two weeks after immunization titers of total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2c in plasma were determined by ELISA (Fig. 2\n). Both rOv-ASP-1 and alum significantly enhanced total IgG levels compared to TIV alone (p\n < 0.05) with no significant difference in total IgG between rOv-ASP-1-vaccinated and alum-vaccinated mice (p\n > 0.05). The level of IgG1 antibody was significantly higher in TIV + alum group than both TIV alone and TIV + rOv-ASP-1 groups (p\n < 0.05). Notably, only TIV + rOv-ASP-1, but neither TIV + alum nor TIV alone, induced a significant IgG2c response to influenza vaccine. These results demonstrate that rOv-ASP-1 enhances both total IgG and IgG1 responses similar to alum, but elicits a significant influenza-specific IgG2c that is not seen with either TIV alone or with alum in primary immunization.",

Recently, a protein with adjuvant properties, named rOv-ASP-1, has been discovered from the helminth parasite O. volvulus. It is a member of a family of proteins found in both free-living and parasitic nematodes [13]. The recombinant protein has a molecular weight of 24.9 kD and also has angiogenic activity in mice [13]. Our present study demonstrates that rOv-ASP-1 is a powerful adjuvant with immunogenic characteristics that may help overcome limitations of current influenza vaccines. rOv-ASP-1 significantly enhanced total IgG responses compared to immunization with TIV alone at each dose of influenza vaccine tested in our mouse model. Importantly, a low dose of vaccine administered with rOv-ASP-1 induced the total IgG response to a level as high as, if not higher than, immunization with 10 times higher dose of vaccine alone. These results demonstrate the potency of rOv-ASP-1 as an adjuvant to enhance the IgG response to TIV and to allow for dose sparing of TIV antigen. Antigen sparing is crucial when there is a pandemic influenza outbreak because the slow process and limited capacity of current influenza vaccine production does not always meet the sudden need for a large amount of vaccine.",

Recently, it has been reported that rOv-ASP-1 primarily binds to APCs and induces Th1-dominated pro-inflammatory cytokines [16]. Consistent with this finding, we observed that addition of rOv-ASP-1 to TIV enhanced not only total IgG, but more significantly the Th1 IgG2c response. Neither vaccine alone nor vaccine with alum induced detectable amounts of IgG2c. This difference in antibody response may be responsible for the difference in protection we observed after challenge with a lethal dose of influenza virus: mice immunized with influenza vaccine plus rOv-ASP-1 provided better protection than immunization with vaccine alone, which contrasts to the report that mice immunized with TIV plus alum suffer from more severe weight loss and have significantly higher virus loads in lungs than those receiving vaccine alone [28]. A recent study indicates that the Th1 response induced by influenza vaccine plays a more important role in protection against influenza infection [28]. Our results are consistent with this finding and further suggest that the Th1 response induced by influenza vaccine plus rOv-ASP-1 may play an important role in cross-protection against influenza infection.",

            "text": "It is interesting that primary immunization with TIV plus rOv-ASP-1 does not induce detectable antibody to PR8 nor prevent weight loss after challenge with PR8 but does result in survival of most mice. This is actually similar to what has been observed in the elderly population receiving TIV: they have low levels of antibody responses to the circulating influenza virus and show influenza symptoms when infected with influenza virus, but demonstrate less severe disease as indicated by fewer hospitalizations than non-immunized elderly who are infected with influenza [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. A secondary immunization of elderly with TIV annually is not a realistic public health strategy. However, if the cross-reactivity observed in our studies was demonstrated to be a broad based cross-reaction against multiple strains of influenza (e.g. all H1N1), influenza vaccination may not need to be annual if the duration of the cross-reactive protection afforded by two immunizations of TIV plus rOv-ASP-1 is shown to be long lasting. A booster immunization with TIV plus rOv-ASP-1 is possible since it could protect against multiple strains of influenza thus eliminating the need for annual immunization. Currently, we are testing if rOv-ASP-1 can enhance antibody response and protection against influenza in aged mice after TIV immunization and if the protection is long lasting.",

The rOv-ASP-1 enhances a stronger Th1-associated antibody response to influenza vaccine compared to the conventional adjuvant alum, and it enhances cross-reactive antibody responses. Importantly, rOv-ASP-1 enhances the protection afforded by an inactivated influenza vaccine after challenge with an antigenically distinct strain. Our results clearly demonstrate that rOv-ASP-1 is an effective adjuvant in accelerating and enhancing the specific antibody response induced by influenza vaccine, and has the potential to allow antigen sparing and enhance heterologous protection.",
