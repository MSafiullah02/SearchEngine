Almost all living species represent prey for a viral invader. Viruses have coevolved with their hosts and therefore have limited pathogenicity in an immunocompetent natural host. In turn, probably as a result of the constant evolutionary pressure from viral invaders, higher vertebrates have developed a complex immune system. Only in the last decade have we have caught a glimpse of what viruses do beyond invading cells for replication. For millions of years viruses have studied cell biology and immunology the hard way, to acquire and defend an ecological niche. It is remarkable that, in the process, individual virus families have targeted many common immunological principles.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Viruses that belong to different families are subject to different constraints. Owing to the low fidelity of RNA polymerase, the genome size of RNA viruses is limited. Although this confers the advantage of being able to use mutation to escape immune control, there is little room in the genome to allow immune defenses to be encoded by individual genes. The proteins encoded by RNA viruses are therefore multifunctional. This particular constraint is less rigid for DNA viruses as their genome size allows a larger number of genes to be devoted to host control. In the case of herpesviruses and poxviruses, these genes probably account for \u03fe50% of the total genome.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Viruses can exist in two forms: extracellular virion particles and intracellular genomes. Virions are more resistant to physical stress than genomes but are susceptible to humoral immune control. Virus genomes can be maintained in host cells by limited gene expression and can evade the host immune response. Nevertheless, to exist as a species, virus replication and transfer to a new host are essential. These processes are associated with the production of antigenic proteins that make the virus vulnerable to immune control mechanisms 'warning' the host of the presence of an invader. However, viruses have evolved strategies to evade such immune control mechanisms, and the list of these strategies forms the 'Who's who' of today's immunology.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "There are two classes of viral immunoregulatory proteins: those encoded by genes with, and those encoded by genes without, sequence homology to cellular genes.

Some of these receptors silence the cytolytic machinery of NK cells and act as killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIR). Other receptors, designated leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LIR), are expressed mainly on monocytes and B cells. Engagement of an NK receptor can alternatively result in NK activation as not all receptors have immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) in their intracellular domains. The HCMV protein UL18 and the MCMV m144 protein, which are homologous to MHC class I, could be associated with NK killing, and UL18 is instrumental in the identification of LIR-1. In addition, the HCMV UL40 protein provides a peptide selectively required for the maturation of the HLA-E molecule, an NK target 39, 40 .
