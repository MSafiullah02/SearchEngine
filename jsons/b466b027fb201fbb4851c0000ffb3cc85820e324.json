This gap can be addressed by estimating airport catchment areas. This research aims to determine how existing market area delineation techniques estimate airport catchments differently, and which techniques are best suited to anticipate where infectious diseases may spread. Multiple techniques were tested for airports in the Province of Ontario, Canada: circular buffers, drive-time buffers, Thiessen polygons, and the Huff model, with multiple variations tested for some techniques. The results were compared qualitatively and quantitatively based on spatial patterns as well as area and population of each catchment area. There were notable differences, specifically between deterministic and probabilistic approaches. Deterministic techniques may only be suitable if all airports in a study area are similar in terms of attractiveness. The probabilistic Huff model appeared to produce more realistic results because it accounted for variation in airport attractiveness. Additionally, the Huff model requires few inputs and therefore would be efficient to execute in situations where time, resources, and data are limited.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Air travel is a key mechanism facilitating the international spread of infectious disease.

If an analyst had a defined study area in which they knew their analyses would be conducted, this network could be pre-processed. However, if this technique had to be executed for locations globally, it would likely require additional resources to prepare a road network dataset. Moreover, infectious disease events may occur in remote or rural areas, or in developing countries, for which road network data often do not exist or are not readily available. Furthermore, road transportation via vehicle is not always the main method of transportation in remote areas. For example, during the recent outbreak of Ebola in Bikoro, Democratic Republic of Congo, the primary transporta- tion route to the nearest major population centres was not by road but via the Congo River (WHO 2018). While the three deterministic methods can be efficient, the results for our study area did not appear to be realistic in the context of the differences in attractiveness between airports; there are few airports in Ontario with high flight and passenger volumes. The distance-only deterministic methods might be more appropriate in cases where airports are equally distributed across a study area and are similarly attractive. Alternatively, for circular and drive-time buffer methods multiple buffer sizes could be applied. For example, a larger buffer could be applied for international airports or those with higher passenger/flight volumes, and a smaller buffer could be applied for domestic airports or those with lower passenger/flight volumes. Overall, deterministic methods could likely provide a general estimate of airport catchment areas in time-limited situations, though results would come with numerous limitations. The probabilistic Huff model required additional inputs but was still relatively efficient to execute. In contrast to the deterministic methods, the Huff model estimated the greatest variation between catchment areas of the different airports. While this study did not incorporate validation of results based on observed data, the Huff model results appear to be reasonable considering the passenger and flight volume associated with each airport. It would be expected that people travel from much further to reach YYZ due to its high volume of flights, and because they might not be able to travel to their intended destination from smaller airports in Ontario. However, the Huff model estimated that subdivisions even at the northern border of Ontario were most likely to use YYZ. This is unrealistic and could be addressed by defining a distance cut-off in the model to restrict the choice set to airports within a reasonable distance. Additionally, the Huff model, as it was implemented in this study, does not account for the potential of flight connections. For example, an individual could take a domestic flight from YTS to YYZ, and then fly to an international destination from YYZ. Such itineraries could be represented in the attractiveness variable if more detailed data were available.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Fig. 13"}, {"text": "The characteristics of results based on each technique must also be considered based on the situation in which this approach would be implemented. Specifically, it is important to consider whether full coverage of the study area is required, i.e. whether all locations in the study area must be assigned to at least one airport catchment area. This may be needed if the spread of a local outbreak through outbound passengers was to be forecast. Only the Thiessen polygon and Huff model techniques meet this requirement, while the buffering methods do not cover the entire study area.

Considering YYZ's high flight and passenger volume compared to the other airports, it may be possible that its true catchment area covers a large portion of the province, as estimated by the Huff model.

In the airport locations and associated passenger dataset obtained from Statistics Canada, some data were suppressed and at least one important airport location was not included for unknown reasons. In future research, Billy Bishop Airport (YTZ) in Toronto, which serves approximately 2.8 million travelers annually (PortsToronto 2018), should be included to better understand its impact on the catchment area of Pearson International Airport (YYZ). Second, the comparison between results based on domestic and international passengers did not include travel to the U.S., since that is included in the \"transborder\" variable. Additional analysis could be conducted to analyze results based on travel to the U.S. specifically, or the variable could be merged with international passengers. Third, the open-source Huff model tool did not have an option to apply a distance cut-off to represent a maximum distance that an individual would be willing to travel. Without the use of a distance cut-off, Toronto's YYZ received high probability for individuals living in northern Ontario-in some cases over 1500 km away. The option to apply a distance cut-off would ensure a more realistic representation of travel to airports. Instead of travelling an unreasonably far distance, someone might choose to take a connecting flight from a local airport to a larger, more attractive airport from which to fly to their final destination. There was no obvious solution to including connecting flights in the modeling approaches, yet this would likely result in larger at-risk areas. Essentially, the catchment areas of larger airports would need to be extended to include the local catchments of smaller, connected airports, resulting in a network of airport catchment areas. Fourth, the methods did not consider airports outside of Ontario, such as US airports in Buffalo and Detroit just outside the Canadian border, which would likely reduce the estimated catchment sizes of some southern Ontario airports. Addressing this limitation would require expanding the study area to include parts of the United States. Fifth, we could not validate results with empirical data due to lack of access to such data.
