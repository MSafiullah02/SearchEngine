Though this was not specifically addressed, this partnership between public health and schools could lead to better school preparedness for future events. 6 Taken together, this information suggests that interventions are needed to increase school readiness. One viable option is to train school nurses to improve preparedness in this environment. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of an educational intervention for school nurses aimed at improving school preparedness for biological events. We hypothesized that that this type of intervention would increase school preparedness scores. Another goal of this project was to examine school readiness for biological events other than pandemics, including bioterrorism and outbreaks of emerging pathogens, such as Ebola or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS Co-V).",

The questionnaire was developed based on the instrument used in the 2011 school preparedness study, 4 though it was greatly expanded to provide a more comprehensive analysis of school readiness. The original questionnaire consisted of 17 school biological event preparedness indicators. We added 18 new items by incorporating standards outlined in recent Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 8 and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) 9 planning documents. Most additions focused on school culture and policies related to infectious disease management, food biosecurity plans, and the incorporation of psychological needs into the school plan. The instrument included 15 questions related to all-hazards school disaster preparedness and 35 measured biological event preparedness (13 of the disaster preparedness indicators plus 22 unique to infectious diseases). Twenty-nine of the 35 biological event preparedness indicators were dichotomous and scored either 0 or 1 point, depending on whether the school met the criteria or not. Examples include having a written policy that encourages students to stay home when ill, having a designated sick room without pass through, and having a plan that addressed biological events (all scored as ''yes'' = 1 point; ''no'' = 0). Six of the 35 biological event preparedness indicators could be partially met and were assigned 1, 0.5, or 0 points, depending on the extent to which the school met the criteria. One example was the indicator ''respiratory hygiene training for staff,'' which could be completely met (all staff trained: 1 point), partially met (some staff trained: 0.5 point), or not met at all (no staff trained: 0 points). Table 1 outlines the preparedness indicators and how each was measured or scored. Psychometric testing conducted on the instrument has been described previously in research utilizing the questionnaire. 4",

Planning documents used to develop intervention content included NASN's Disaster Preparedness Guidelines for School Nurses, 10 CDC's Bioterrorism & Emergency Preparedness Competencies, 11 USDA's Biosecurity Checklist for School Foodservice Programs. 9 Content for the 6 modules consisted of the following modules: (1) an introduction to bioterrorism, pandemic, and infectious disease preparedness for schools (description of the epidemiology and threat of infectious diseases and importance of school biological event preparedness); (2 and 3) components of a school disaster plan (role of school nurses in disaster planning, staff and student disaster planning training needs, disaster supplies needed by schools, mental health needs related to disasters, infection prevention in school settings, etc); (4) syndromic surveillance-school and public health partnerships (definition and description of syndromic surveillance, syndromic surveillance indicators schools may collect/report, how syndromic surveillance data is used by public health officials, and how the data may be used internally by school officials to quickly identify an event); (5) partnering with regional agencies, disaster exercises, and legal issues (importance of disaster exercises involving an infectious disease scenario, impact on school plans from coordination with local response partners, and public health laws to protect workers during disasters); and (6) case studies of successful school disaster preparedness programs (interviews with school nurses actively involved in their school disaster planning committee, best practices learned through work experience, and discussion of perceived advantages to being involved in disaster planning). Each module lasted approximately 20 minutes, and could be paused, fast-forwarded or rewound at any time. Nurse participation in any or all of the modules was optional.

All nurses reported that their school conducted at least 1 exercise per school year, and almost all (94%, N = 125) conducted an interior lockdown exercise annually. However, less than one third (30.8%, n = 41) reported meeting the Missouri standard that the school conduct a fire drill at least once per month.

That study used online educational modules about emergency preparedness and found that the school nurses' knowledge increased from preto post-training, but their confidence in their ability to perform the tasks did not change. 12 That study only assessed school nurses' emergency preparedness knowledge and skills and did not examine the impact of training on school preparedness.",

However, the increase in preparedness was not proportional to the numbers of modules watched and the reasons for the absence of dose response are unclear. It is possible that a single school year may not have provided a sufficient amount of time for nurses to implement numerous changes to their school disaster plans, regardless of how much useful information they obtained from the education intervention. Disaster planning is a relatively slow, laborious process involving development of a written plan, assessment of the plan through drills or exercises and/or comparing the written plan to published guidelines, identifying planning gaps, and implementing interventions to improve the plan. 13 Numerous obstacles can arise during the planning process, such as differing priorities between administrators and the disaster planning committee, the need to get multiple individuals or groups to agree on proposed plan changes, and the necessity of identifying funding to pay for potentially costly interventions. Planning obstacles may have been amplified in this population because many of the nurses covered multiple schools, thereby making implementation of changes much more complicated. Given more time, the nurses may have the opportunity to integrate more of the information into their school plans, despite the challenges of having multiple schools to serve. Future studies should consider a longer intervention and data collection period to see if the educational module impact can be improved with additional time.",

            "text": "Another reason for the modest impact of this educational intervention could be a concurrent but unrelated decline in disaster preparedness in the schools during the same time frame. For example, significantly fewer schools reported having conducted a fire drill each month on the postintervention survey compared with the preintervention survey. This could be because the nurses anticipated at the beginning of the school year that the school would meet the Missouri standard of conducting a fire drill at least monthly, 14 but realized at the end of the school year that the school had not actually met the standard. Another preparedness indicator that decreased significantly from beginning to end of the year was the existence of a written policy encouraging sick employees to stay home. This change may have been due to the school nurse having assumed such a policy existed when she/he completed the preintervention survey, but found out some time during the school year that such a policy did not in fact exist. It is also possible, though less probable, that the school district changed the attendance policy for staff during the course of the 2013-2014 school year. It is difficult to discern whether some of the schools actually became less prepared in some areas or if the postintervention survey was simply a more accurate reflection of school preparedness. Regardless, these negative changes from pre-to postintervention may have resulted in the intervention appearing less effective than it truly was. Nurses in this study reported that their schools had fairly active disaster exercise programs internally, and many of the nurses indicated that they had personally participated in 3 or more drills in the last year, in addition to fire drills. However, almost all of the exercises conducted were school rather than regional drills. Regional disaster exercises are critical to evaluate community resilience. These need to include schools, particularly for bioterrorism and other infectious disease related events, because children spend so much of their day in the school setting and disease spread can be amplified in this setting. 15, 16 Another limitation to drill programs in individual schools is that they primarily consist of fire, tornado, and interior lockdown (ie, active shooter) scenarios. Other types of disaster drills are much less common, and even the schools' number of fire drills did not meet the Missouri standard. 14 Few schools have conducted an exercise in the last year involving an infectious disease scenario, and even fewer plan to use one in the next 2 years. This is consistent with the findings of a 2006 study involving Missouri nurses that found that over 80% had not participated in a bioterrorismscenario drill. 17 It is vital that schools incorporate more infectious disease scenarios into their disaster exercises, because researchers have indicated that hosting exercises increases the ability to respond to a real event. Klaiman et al 6 reported that pre-event mass vaccination exercises in schools made deployment of actual school-based vaccination clinics easier during the H1N1 influenza pandemic. Cauchemez et al 7 asserted that schools need to host a drill to discuss policies and practices related to school closures during pandemics.",

These findings imply that schools have not made much progress toward having access to PPE during disasters. The reasons for lack of progress in this area are unknown. Costs associated with stockpiling PPE, the need to have adequate storage space for the supplies, and personnel time required to maintain the inventory, are likely to be the primary causes of this deficiency. 20 There may also be a lack of awareness or priority for PPE stockpiling among school administrators who make decisions about funding allocation, though this has not been assessed.",

Although the intervention was not consistent across participants in terms of the number of modules watched, the data analysis process assessed dose response (ie, impact from watching more modules) and none was found. Although the overall response rate was similar to other online surveys, 21 few nurses completed both a pre-and postintervention survey, resulting in a small sample size for assessing the impact of the intervention.

School disaster preparedness needs to become a bigger priority for community emergency management. One way to accomplish this is for school districts to partner with local public health officials to pursue funding opportunities for disaster preparedness. Previous research has found that schools that had designated disaster planning funds were significantly more likely to perceive their schools as being prepared, had more coordination with external agencies, and had stockpiled more emergency equipment and supplies than schools that lacked disaster planning funding. 22 Funding streams for school preparedness vary from state to state. However, there has been a general decreasing trend in available funds. For instance, federal funding provided through the US Department of Education's Readiness and Emergency Management for Schools grant was stopped after fiscal year 2010. 23 Many schools lack funding for vital educational initiatives and disaster planning may be a lower priority than other school needs, such as books or technology. Schools may seek disaster planning funding through state and local emergency management planning agencies, schoolbased fundraisers, and private foundation grants or donations. 22 The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides resources for school funding at their School Safety website; 24 school administrators and disaster planners can apply for DHS funding to cover staff training and planning efforts.",

            "text": "Disaster planning funding can be used to purchase much-needed supplies. An important finding from this study is that having full-time on-site health professional coverage is associated with more stockpiling of supplies. Perhaps schools that invest in medical care provision at school also prioritize PPE as a method of protecting health care personnel working at the school. Even without funding, schools can increase their preparedness for biological events by prearranging access to PPE through the development of an MOA. During a biological event, access to PPE will be essential to protect school nurses and other school staff from being exposed to contagious students. Gaining access to PPE will be more challenging for schools during biological events, because most vendors have a 6-9-month backorder for PPE and PPE from regional and federal stockpiles is likely to be prioritized to hospitals and other acute care facilities. 20, 25 If schools hope to obtain PPE from regional or federal stockpiles, this needs to be coordinated through the community emergency management plan before a disaster occurs. Stockpiled supplies and/or existing MOAs will enable the school to access PPE, which could result in decreased disease spread in the school setting. Confidence in personal safety, such as making PPE available to health care personnel during pandemics and other biological events, has also been associated with increased willingness to report to work, which would increase school and community resilience. 26, 27 US Department of Homeland Security funding is also available for the purchase of disaster supplies, including PPE. 24 Schools need to increase disaster exercise participation, especially as it relates to biological preparedness. Incorporating an infectious disease scenario into a school drill is not complicated and could highlight areas of school preparedness that are sorely lacking, such as the need for distance-based education plans or policies for transporting potentially contagious children. Hosting an infectious disease-based school exercise will allow nurses the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to respond to biological emergencies, a competency outlined by the CDC for all public health clinical staff. 5, 11 Using a biological scenario can also strengthen the relationship between schools and public health by hosting a multi-agency drill aimed at assessing community and school preparedness for infectious diseases. For example, schools can host a tabletop exercise to discuss school closures for a future pandemic or response plans for a foodborne bioterrorism attack. Another option is be to host an open-or closed-POD exercise to distribute vaccines to students and school staff during influenza season. This would improve readiness for future large-scale infectious disease disasters as well as build resilience for seasonal influenza.",
