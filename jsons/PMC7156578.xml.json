            "text": "The processes of political development, primarily as they apply to stable and unstable political systems and change, have always been dynamic, especially in crisis situations such as outbreaks of infectious diseases in less-developed countries. Crisis situations test the stability of political systems in revealing ways, placing extraordinary demands on the political leadership and the existing public health structure and processes of the country. In the absence of early and effective preparedness, societies may experience social and economic disruption, threats to the continuity of essential services, reduced production, distribution difficulties, and shortages of essential commodities. The WHO emphasizes a \u201cwhole-of-society\u201d approach that emphasizes significant roles not only for the health sector, but also by all other sectors, individuals, families, and communities, in mitigating the effects of a pandemic.10 Developing such capacities is at the heart of preparing the whole of society for a pandemic. I assert that it is the loss of the whole of society\u02bcs concept, thinking, and participation that is systematically destroyed in autocratic regimes that contributes to why these political systems fail. They fail when citizens have no defined ownership, channels of communication, or are allowed to participate in any aspect of the disaster cycle (prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, or rehabilitation). They fail when citizens are not allowed a voice in the implementation of acceptable policies when the political system ceases to be viewed as responsive by individuals and groups making demands on it, and by what is considered inappropriate political behavior.",

It demands generalizations, ideas, the ability to identify the relationship between verbal and nonverbal ideas, and to understand the multiple meanings that underlie an event, statement, or object; an example often cited is: \u201cThe Liberty Bell is not just a piece of American history, but is a symbol of freedom.\u201d18 Concrete thinkers misinterpret many concepts like this and are compelled to reinterpret them in their own concrete manner in political speeches and legislative decisions.",

            "text": "Abstract thinking refers to a cognitive concept involving higher-order, or complex thoughts. To be able to think in an abstract manner implies that one is able to draw conclusions or illustrate relationships among concepts in a manner beyond what is obvious.19 Often the terms \u201cabstract thought\u201d and \u201cconcept formation\u201d are used interchangeably. In the past, the term \u201cfluid intelligence\u201d has been used to refer to the ability to reason. The generation of concepts, or abstract ideas, indicates an ability to progress beyond concrete thinking. The concrete interpretation of a concept involves a focus on the salient, obvious characteristics. Progressing beyond the tangible characteristics in order to conceptualize theoretical relationships between items or processes involves abstract thought. Deeper meanings such as \u201cfreedom,\u201d \u201cequality,\u201d \u201ccharity,\u201d \u201clove,\u201d and \u201cdemocracy\u201d express ideas, concepts, or qualities that cannot be seen or experienced.20 They are considered only in the concrete sense as it applies to autocratic thinkers. The US Constitution would not be understood in the manner it was originally written as it is an example of a document that requires abstract thought and is either not read, understood, or interpreted concretely by a leadership that is completely self-serving. Concepts such as freedom and equal rights interpreted concretely become self-serving. Studies demonstrate that \u201cpersons with different value preferences apply different neurobiological strategies when facing a decision\u201d and can help explain the fixed values that decisions are made that are independent of an actual situation.21 This stubbornness of thought and action is reflected in shared personality disorders of autocratic despots. Brain areas beyond those activated in actual moral dilemma situations were found to be involved. They are psychologically fixed, as illustrated by Muammar Gaddafi when he was being beaten to death by his own people, claiming up to the last minute: \u201cbut the people love me!\u201d",

Public measures for their control in Russia are insufficient, mainly because of the lack of funding for treatment, vaccine prophylaxis, and health education. Tuberculosis has become an epidemic in a country where it was once a rarity. Immunity is down because of poverty, too little food, and difficult access to health care. Russian doctors are worried that the TB epidemic could lead to epidemics of another disease. Today, TB is endemic in Russia, and there is a rising incidence of multi-drug-resistant strains of TB.75 Like other autocratic regimes, Russia\u02bcs \u201cpolitical model\u201d of globalization that feeds transnational research and treatment of infectious diseases is seriously flawed and must take responsibility for the prevention of the spread of infectious disease beyond their borders accelerated by enhanced migration.76 What this reveals are cautious doubts about whether Russia, combined with shortages of medical supplies and inadequate standards that further highlights a number of public health challenges for the country, has the public health and political capacity to manage a serious COVID-19 epidemic.",

I stated:The intent of a legally binding Treaty to improve the capacity of all countries to detect, assess, notify, and respond to public health threats are being ignored. While there is a current rush to admonish globalization in favor of populism, epidemic and pandemics deserve better than decisions being made by incapable autocrats. During Ebola, a rush by the Global Health Security Agenda partners to fill critical gaps in administrative and operational areas was crucial in the short term, but questions remain as to the real priorities of the global leadership as time elapses and critical gaps in public health protections and infrastructure take precedence over the economic and security needs of the developed world. The response from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and foreign medical teams to Ebola proved indispensable to global health security, but both deserve stronger strategic capacity support and institutional status under the WHO leadership granted by the [International Health Regulations] Treaty. Treaties are the most successful means the world has in preventing, preparing for, and controlling epidemics in an increasingly globalized world. Other options are not sustainable. Given the gravity of on-going failed treaty management, the slow and incomplete process of reform, the magnitude and complexity of infectious disease outbreaks, and the rising severity of public health emergencies, a recommitment must be made to complete and restore the original mandates as a collaborative and coordinated global network responsibility, not one left to the actions of individual countries. The bottom line is that the global community can no longer tolerate an ineffectual and passive international response system. As such, this Treaty has the potential to become one of the most effective treaties for crisis response and risk reduction world-wide. Practitioners and health decision-makers world-wide must break their silence and advocate for a stronger Treaty and a return of WHO authority. Health practitioners and health decision-makers world-wide must break their silence and advocate for a stronger Treaty and a return of WHO\u02bcs undisputed global authority.81\nWill China\u02bcs unilateral decisions just be a temporary stay as it was post-SARS, or is China capable of adopting, without conditions, the WHO public health requirements they have so far ignored?",
