A novel coronavirus strain was discovered and reported in November 2012 and was subsequently called Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS CoV) 2. Pneumonia caused by MERS CoV has been associated with severe morbidity and mortality in immunocompetent populations. However, clinical picture varies widely, it ranges from asymptomatic carrier state to severe rapidly fatal pneumonia 3. Certain risk factors for developing MERS CoV pneumonia and for having poor outcome such as end\u2010stage renal disease have been identified 4. However, data on the clinical picture in solid organ transplant recipients and the effect of the anti\u2010rejection immunosuppressive regimens on the clinical course of MERS CoV infection are lacking. There has only been one previously reported case of a renal transplant recipient with MERS CoV pneumonia 5. We report two cases of MERS CoV pneumonia in renal transplant recipients with variable clinical presentations and outcomes.",

In addition, viral tropism to uroepithelial cells which has been implicated as a cause of the commonly observed acute renal failure in patients with MERS CoV pneumonia may have played a role in causing acute renal failure in this patient as well 10. In an attempt to treat the severe MERS CoV pneumonia, interferon \u03b12a in combination with ribavirin was initiated based on a previous in vitro study where interferon \u03b12b was found to lead to a dose dependent reduction in the number of genome copies of MERS CoV as well as a reduction in the cytopathic effect, which was magnified when combined with ribavirin in an in vitro model 11. This has led the authors to test this combination in an animal model (macaques) 8 h after they were inoculated with MERS CoV with favorable outcomes 12. The choice of interferon \u03b12a instead of interferon \u03b12b was due to the lack of interferon \u03b12b availability. Failure of this regimen has been demonstrated in a case series that consisted of five patients with severe MERS CoV pneumonia, all of whom had a poor outcome 13. This combination was started late in both our cases and the case series by a minimum of 8 days post\u2010admission with pneumonia. Whether the poor outcome in those cases is related to the delay in administration of treatment or due to lack of true in vivo efficacy in humans is difficult to conclude in the absence of controlled studies. Moreover, a more recent in vitro study demonstrated that interferon \u03b12b has superior anti\u2010MERS CoV activity compared to interferon \u03b12a evidenced by a lower IC50 14. Whether these factors have led to this patient's poor outcome, and whether other factors are involved is impossible to conclude based on the very limited data available.",

The positive outcome may be related in part to the patient's young age. Other factors may have had a positive impact on the outcome but this cannot be determined from a single case. None of the above patients had contact with similarly ill patients. However, the second patient started exhibiting symptoms 12 days after his discharge from the hospital. So his infection may have been from a nosocomial source, as nosocomial transmission has been a major obstacle in the control of MERS infections 15. Both patients were placed in isolation rooms once MERS diagnosis was suspected.",
