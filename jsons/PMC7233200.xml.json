Following the publication of a new decree limiting the movement of individuals in the whole Italian national territory on March 101 and the declaration of Covid-19 pandemic on the basis of \u201calarming levels of spread and severity\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 112, our national health system underwent a gradual and profound reshape. In order to minimize resources exhaustion and transmission risks, elective surgery and admissions were canceled or postponed, and entire Departments converted into Intensive Care and Intermediate Care Units. In the massive reorganization of the hospital, our Department of Urology decreased its clinic and surgical load but remained active as a Covid-free, operating service. However, the levels of activity and safety during a pandemic can be undermined by the risk of admitting patients with unrecognized Covid disease in the ward and operating rooms. In fact, hospital-associated transmission was suspected as the presumed mechanism of infection for 41% affected health professionals and hospitalized patients3. Our objective is to assess the impact of the pandemic and the occurrence and characteristics of Covid-19 in a Covid-free urologic unit in a regional hospital in Northern Italy during the 2020 outbreak.",
