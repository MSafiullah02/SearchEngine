The fear resulting from the disease, the 'lockdown' situation, high levels of uncertainty regarding the future, and financial insecurity raise the level of stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by people all around the world. Psychoactive substances and other reinforcing behaviors (e.g., gambling, video gaming, watching pornography) are often used to reduce stress and anxiety and/or to alleviate depressed mood. The tendency to use such substances and engage in such behaviors in an excessive manner as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable. Moreover, the importance of information and communications technology (ICT) is even higher in the present crisis than usual. ICT has been crucial in keeping parts of the economy going, allowing large groups of people to work and study from home, enhancing social connectedness, providing greatly needed entertainment, etc. Although for the vast majority ICT use is adaptive and should not be pathologized, a subgroup of vulnerable individuals are at risk of developing problematic usage patterns. The present consensus guidance discusses these risks and makes some practical recommendations that may help diminish them.",

            "text": "The novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, an infectious disease characterized by an often severe and sometimes fatal acute respiratory syndrome and caused by a variant coronavirus termed SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Since then it has rapidly spread, globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease a pandemic on 11 March, 2020. As a response to the crisis, governments in numerous countries have introduced a series of steps aiming to curb the effects of the pandemic. The WHO has promoted SARS-CoV-2 testing and contact tracing to prepare health care systems to respond to the disease and limit spread within populations. \"Spatial distancing\" (Abel & McQueen, 2020) is one of the strongly promoted practices and entails creating and keeping safe distances between individuals, as well as reducing the number of times individuals come into close contact with each other. The resulting regulations and recommendations include the temporary closures of childcare and educational institutions, and cultural and entertainment-related locales (e.g., clubs, cinemas, theaters, museums, sporting arenas). They also typically include encouraging employees and companies to use remote (home) working practices when feasible. In essence, spatial distancing is aimed at promoting staying home and self-isolation but, in some instances, it also involves limiting free movement and/or placing individuals in quarantine.",

Especially vulnerable are individuals with preexisting mental and physical health conditions, those lacking social support, and first responders and healthcare workers (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). In extreme cases, fear may contribute to fatal outcomes and suicide, including among individuals who thought they had contracted the virus even though autopsies showed they did not (e.g., Mamun & Griffiths, 2020) . Time spent at home has J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f increased considerably for most individuals, which may lead to a reduction or loss of daily routine and structure. Moreover, being in 'lockdown' alone (or with family members), coupled with high states of uncertainty regarding the future and financial insecurity, may also contribute to heightened stress, anxiety, depression and a general decrease in psychological wellbeing (Ahorsu et al., 2020; Wiederhold, 2020) . Concurrently, research into the precise psychological impact of the current situation is on-going; not all individuals will be unduly impacted to the same degree (Kaufman, Petkova, Bhui, & Schulze, 2020) . Nevertheless, it is worth acknowledging that the WHO has established general health guidelines for the staying home period that include useful tips for physical activity, mental health, parenting, healthy eating and quitting tobacco (World Health Organization, 2020a).",

As a result, the tendency to use such substances and engage in the aforementioned behaviors as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic increases considerably and may develop into habits that are difficult to break (King, Delfabbro, Billieux, & Potenza, 2020; Ko & Yen, 2020 ; Mestre-Bach, Blycker, & Potenza, 2020).",

On the one hand, ICT is a \"savior\"; it contributes vitally to disseminating knowledge about the outbreak to wide sectors of the global population, to an extent not possible without such technology. Information flow is a key factor in fighting the pandemic (enabling individuals to have instant access to reliable information, while granting researchers with means for collaboration on a global scale in the race to develop a vaccine and efficient treatment strategies, for example). Working and studying remotely is possible due to the use of ICT. Keeping social contact remotely with friends/families to reduce psychological impacts of isolation, providing access to entertainment and even materials guiding physical exercise (e.g., live streaming home fitness sessions) are realized through ICT and represent strategies recommended by the WHO (World Health Organization, 2020b). Furthermore, medical and psychological consultation and psychotherapy both in the case of addictive disorders and other mental disorders may be conducted online when appropriate (Conrad, Rayala, Diamond, Busch, & Kramer, 2020) .",

When dealing with difficulties, openly communicating about emotions with a close relative or friend, asking for help and feeling social support can effectively help to reduce stress and anxiety. \uf0b7 Enjoying social activities and maintaining relationships are also crucial (Van Bavel et al., 2020) . Family members should arrange to spend quality time with each other and have \"family time\" periods on a regular basis. Family time may include meaningful conversations, playing social games or sports, eating meals and doing household chores together. \uf0b7 For individuals who live together with their family or others, it may be useful to find ways of being alone or having some self-time regularly. It may help to negotiate spaces in the house for individual and common use, as well as to establish and respect boundaries such as doors being open or closed. This may help reduce frustration and conflicts that may arise from being confined in the same place for long periods. \uf0b7 Following the WHO advice to keep up-to-date on the status of the pandemic and public health advice from reliable news sources in a circumscribed way (e.g., watching a reputable news broadcast once or twice per day at a specified time) while limiting excessive exposure to such news can promote balanced and informed thinking about the pandemic.",

Parents are also encouraged to actively participate in the ICT-related behaviors of their children (e.g., playing video games together with them).
