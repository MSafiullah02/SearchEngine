            "text": "The coronavirus pandemic has rapidly evolved into an unprecedented crisis. The susceptible-infectiousremoved (SIR) model and its variants have been used for modeling the pandemic. However, timeindependent parameters in the classical models may not capture the dynamic transmission and removal processes, governed by virus containment strategies taken at various phases of the epidemic. Moreover, very few models account for possible inaccuracies of the reported cases. We propose a Poisson model with time-dependent transmission and removal rates to account for possible random errors in reporting and estimate a time-dependent disease reproduction number, which may be used to assess the effectiveness of virus control strategies. We apply our method to study the pandemic in several severely impacted countries, and analyze and forecast the evolving spread of the coronavirus. We have developed an interactive web application to facilitate readers' use of our method. arXiv:2004.05730v1 [q-bio.PE] 13 Apr 2020 SIR models originated from the Kermack-McKendrick model [18] , consisting of three coupled differential equations to describe the dynamics of the numbers in the S, I and R compartments, which tend to fluctuate over time. For example, the number of infectious individuals increases drastically at the start of the epidemic, with a surge in susceptible individuals becoming infectious. As the epidemic develops, the number of infectious individuals decreases when more infectious individuals die or recover than susceptible individuals become infectious. The epidemic ends when the infectious compartment ceases to exist [16, 18] .",

For example, as a result of various virus containment strategies, such as self-quarantine and social distancing mandates, the transmission and removal rates may vary over time [24] . Recently, [25] [26] [27] considered time-dependent SIR models adapted to the dynamical epidemiological processes evolving over time. However, very few considered random errors in reporting, such as under-reporting (e.g. asymptomatic cases or virus mutation) or over-reporting (e.g. false positives of testing), or characterized the uncertainty of predictions.",

First, unlike the deterministic ODE-based SIR models, our method does not require transmission and removal rates to be known, but estimates them using the data. Second, we allow these rates to be time-varying. Some time-varying SIR approaches [27] directly integrated into the model the information on when governments enforced, for example, quarantine, social-distancing, compulsory mask-wearing and city lockdowns. We differ by computing a time-varying R 0 , which gauges the status of coronavirus containment and assesses the effectiveness of virus control strategies. Third, our Poisson model accounts for possible random errors in reporting (such as false positives and false negatives of infectious cases), and quantifies the uncertainty of the predicted numbers of susceptible, infectious and removed. Finally, we have developed an interactive web application which facilitates readers' use of our method.",

The key idea is to divide a total population into three compartments: the susceptible, S, who are healthy individuals capable of contracting the disease; the infectious, I, who have the disease and are infectious; and the removed, R, who have recovered from the disease and gained immunity or who have died from the disease [16] . The model assumes a one-way flow from susceptible to infectious to removed, and is reasonable for infectious diseases, which are transmitted from human to human, and where recovery confers lasting resistance [17] .",

Accurate assessment of i 0 can be problematic as in the beginning of an epidemic, cases are likely to be underreported or unreported because of lack of awareness or lack of testing. For a deterministic SIR model (5) , r(t) and i(t) may heavily depend on their initial values. As shown in Figure 1 , when the initial value i 0 is mis-specified to be 5 times of the truth, the curves of i(t) and r(t) are biased to the left. On the other hand, our proposed statistical model (8) , by accounting for the randomness of the observed data, is more robust toward the mis-specification of i 0 and r 0 , and estimates r(t) and i(t) with negligible biases even with mis-specified initial values. We also mis-specify i 0 to be only twice of the truth, and obtain the same results, which are omitted. q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q True q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q (5) with true initials (\"True\"), and with the mis-specified initials (\"Mis-specified\"), and the estimated i(t) and r(t) using the proposed model (8) with the mis-specified initials (\"Proposed\").

As of 4/9/2020, the basic reproduction number R 0 has been computed for 17 severely impacted countries ( Figure 3 ). Among them, the estimated R 0 ranges from 1.16 to 17.40, with an average of 5.7. Countries, such as China and Korea, which developed the virus outbreak early, have a relatively lowR 0 of 1.16 and 2.44, meaning the outbreak has been reasonably controlled. Other countries, such as India, the US and Brazil, which were hit hard by the pandemic recently, have seen a ramp-up in virus testing with more cases detected, and the estimated R 0 is alarmingly high with 8.99, 14.1 and 17.4, respectively.

Some European countries, such as France, Iran, Italy and Spain, which were hit later than the Asian countries, share a similar pattern, though with much flatter slopes.

Applications of our method to study the epidemics in several selected countries illustrate the results of the virus containment policies implemented in these countries, and may serve as the epidemiological benchmarks for the future preventive measures. q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qqqqqqqqqqqq qqq qq qq qq q q q q q q q q qq qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq q qq qq qqq qq qqq qqqqq qqqqq qqqqqqqqqqqqq qqq qq qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq qq qq qq qqq qqqq qqqqqqqq qqqqqqqqqqqqq qqq qq qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq qq qq qq qqq qqqq qqqqqqqq qqqqqqqqqqqqq qqq qq qq q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q qq qq qq qqq qqqq qqqqqqq qq China R q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q France R q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q Italy R q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q Spain R q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q Korea R q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q Several methodological questions need to be addressed. First, we analyzed each country separately, without considering the traffic flows among these countries. We will develop a joint model for the global epidemic, which accounts for the geographic locations of and the connectivity among the countries. Second, we have ignored the birth and natural death processes (e.g. deaths due to non-COVID-19 causes), and also combined the recovered and deaths in our model. We will extend our model by considering them as separate compartments. Finally, to reduce the computational complexity, we have assumed that log \u03b2(t) and log \u03b3(t) are polynomials and with the same order. Though the performance of our parametric approach is adequate, the model can be refined with more flexible functions or by using nonparametric approaches. In particular, model (5) implies R 0 (t) = 1 + i(t + 1) \u2212 i(t) r(t + 1) \u2212 r(t) , naturally leading to a nonparametric estimator R 0 (t) = 1 + Z I (t + 1) \u2212 Z I (t) Z R (t + 1) \u2212 Z R (t) .",

Measures, e.g. self-quarantine, social distancing, and shelter in place, have been executed at various phases by each country to prevent the community transmission. Timely and effective assessment of these actions constitutes a critical component of the effort. SIR models have been widely used to model this pandemic. However, constant transmission and removal rates may not capture the timely influences of these policies. We propose a time-varying SIR Poisson model to assess the dynamic transmission patterns of COVID-19. With the virus containment measures taken at various time points, R 0 may vary substantially over time. Our model provides a systematic and daily updatable tool to evaluate the immediate outcomes of these actions. As some countries in Asia are now shifting gear to battle the second waves of virus attack induced by the imported cases [51, 52] , our tool may also shed light on and aid the implementation of future containment strategies.",

Results are the averages over 1,000 independent datasets.3.3 Choice of p and estimation of \u03b2 and \u03b3Example 1. With a constant SIR model, we investigate whether the AIC or BIC criterion chooses the correct order of polynomial (p = 0), and compare\u03b2 and\u03b3 with the true \u03b2 and \u03b3. We generate 1,000 independent datasets with the following setting: i 0 = 10 \u22126 , r 0 = 0, \u03b2 = exp(\u03b2 0 ), and \u03b3 = exp(\u03b3 0 ), where \u03b2 0 = 0.35 and \u03b3 0 = \u22121.95, t = 1, . . . , 70.
