The articles were divided into RCTs, systemic reviews, meta-analysis, case series and case reports. The expert group meeting was convened under the aegis of Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine at Pune. The expert group included intensivists from all over India. The evidence on each question was presented and deliberated. Recommendations were formulated and graded according to previous evidence based guidelines of ISCCM16 (Table 1). When there was no evidence, the recommendations were named as Useful Practice Point (UPP)",

Conti et al demonstrated that NIV was superior to IMV even in this setting.33Patients who were ventilated noninvasively had lesser ICU and hospital LOS, infections and other complications. But there was no benefit in terms of survival. Both set of patients (ventilated invasively or non-invasively) demonstrated a similar mortality rate. Another RCT also demonstrated similar results. IMV was beneficial in rapid improvement in sensorium but had longer duration of ventilator use and ICU LOS.36 NIV was associated with fewer respiratory infections and tracheostomies. There was no difference in mortality rates in the two set of patients.36",

It causes \u2018air trapping\u2019 and progressive hyperinflation of the lungs and flattening of the diaphragm. This leads to change in dynamics of the breathing precipitating chronic respiratory failure. As the disease progresses, patients are prone to experience exacerbations and frequent respiratory failure especially hypercapneic failure. Due to frequent infections, catabolic state with malnutrition and muscle wasting; COPD patients are difficult to wean from the invasive ventilation and have more chances to have extubation failure and reintubation. Nava et al. (2005) in their multicentre randomized controlled trial compared standard medical therapy versus immediate post-extubation NIV use in selected high-risk population for re-intubation. They found that, use of NIV in this population reduces the need for reintubation and significantly decrease in intensive care as well as in-hospital mortality.215 Khilnani et al. (2011), conducted a randomized controlled trial to study the effect of NIV immediately post extubation in COPD patients.216 They observed that there was less frequent need for reintubation in patients treated with NIV but ICU and in-hospital stay was same in both groups. In a multicentre randomized trial, C. Girault et al. (2011) investigated effectiveness of NIV as early weaning/ extubation technique in difficult to wean patients having chronic hypercapneic respiratory failure.217 They assigned patients in 3 groups; conventional weaning on invasive ventilation, extubation followed by standard oxygen therapy and extubation to NIV. They found that weaning failure rate along with post-extubation acute respiratory failure rate were significantly less in the NIV group. In Cochrane systematic review, Burnset al. studied trials comparing extubation followed by immediate NIV to continued invasive weaning on mechanical ventilation.218 They included 16 studies with 994 patients and interpreted that weaning to NIV reduces rate of death and pneumonia without increasing risk of weaning failure and reintubation. Mortality benefits were significantly greater in COPD patients in comparison to other subgroup population.218",

Drugs used were Risperidone or haloperidol for intermittent use and dexmedetomidine, midazolam or propofol for continuous infusion, titrated as per RASS scores. The authors concluded that sedation is potentially useful to avoid NIV failure in both groups of patients (DNI and non- DNI).155 An international prospective, observational multicentre study involving 322 ICUs in 30 countries, found that analgesia and sedation, either individually or combined, were used only in 19.6% of patients during NIV. They found when used alone, sedatives and analgesics are safe. However, their simultaneous use was found to be associated with NIV failure.156",

Higher ventilator pressures increase the range of dispersion of exhaled air and amount of air leakage around the interface.163 Other measures which have been useful in reducing the risk of nosocomial transmission of infection with use of NIV include using a dual limb circuit. The bias flow in the single limb circuits, prevents re-breathing and increases circuit leaks, thus also increasing dispersion of infected particles in the air.162 Adding a viral-bacterial filter between the mask and exhalation port has also been found useful to prevent infectious transmission. However, the risk of frequent blockage of the filter with moist secretions makes its use difficult.168 However, pulmonary TB infective particles are 1-5 mm in diameter and spread throughout the room by air currents. Due to relatively long period of infectivity of TB, until the diagnosis and at least 2 weeks after initiation of anti-TB treatment, such patients need to be isolated in negative pressure isolation rooms with HEPA filters and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI).169",

Another meta-analysis showed similar benefits in terms of intubation rates and hospital mortality, in patients with hypoxemic non-hypercapneic acute respiratory failure.188 A recent RCT by Patel et al, of subjects with ARDS, use of helmet reduced intubation rates, improved ventilator free days and improved mortality, over the use of face mask, without increase in the interface associated complications.189 Thus helmet appears promising in patients requiring higher pressures, however, further training of the medical team is necessary before its use.",

In addition, it can be used to adapt NIV settings in real time. An initial ABG to evaluate the respiratory and metabolic state and to rule out a significant discrepancy compared with the transcutaneous measurement is recommended.208",

NIV should only be used if there is good quality evidence of its effectiveness in that particular condition and there is no contraindication. NIV can be used for patients with ARF due to COPD cardiogenic pulmonary, post-operative ARF, palliation in the setting of advanced cancer or other terminal conditions, chest trauma with ARF and to prevent post-extubation respiratory failure in high-risk patients. NIV should not be used in the treatment of patients with established post-extubation respiratory failure. It is important to fine-tune the patient, interface, and ventilator. NIV can be delivered via portable pressure ventilator or the standard ICU type of ventilator found in most intensive care units (ICUs). Pressure modes are preferred because there are many advantages of pressure targeted modes like pressure delivered is constant and pressure targeted ventilation compensates for air leak. Monitor continuously the patient on NIV for the worsening sensorium, respiratory distress, tachypnea, and deteriorating blood gases, and intervene early because delay in intubation worsens outcome. Most complications are minor that can be managed easily, and so every attempt should be made to continue NIV. Weaning can be done by various methods with equal efficacy. Protocol based weaning strategies have been found to be more successful with shorter duration of NIV requirement and shorter ICU length of stay.",
