Intestinal, lymphoid and dendritic epidermal \u03b3\u03b4 T cells develop normally in both athymic and MHC class I/II-deficient mice. The expression of distinct V-gene segments not only marks different subsets, but is often associated with a more-or-less specific preponderance \u2014 for example, V\u03b33V\u03b41 in the epidermis, V\u03b32V\u03b45/6 in the lungs, V\u03b34V\u03b41 in the tongue and uterus/vagina, and V\u03b35V\u03b44/2/5/6 or V\u03b31V\u03b45/6 in the intestinal epithelium (reviewed in [1]). Circulating murine \u03b3\u03b4 T cells mainly express the V\u03b31V\u03b45/6 or V\u03b32V\u03b45 T-cell receptor (TCR) chains. Structures recognized by murine \u03b3\u03b4 T cells include I-Ek (V\u03b32V\u03b45), heat-shock protein 65 (HSP65) (V\u03b31V\u03b44/6), T10/22 (V\u03b32V\u03b45), HSV-gI (V\u03b32V\u03b48) and stressed epithelial cells (V\u03b33V\u03b41). However, \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell stimulatory activities of murine \u03b3\u03b4 ligands have not been examined in vivo, and there is no rodent model for assessing the therapeutic potential of activated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, with the exception of human \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell testing in SCID mice [2].",

Human V\u03b41 T cells form a large subpopulation of gut, skin and lung lymphocytes. Some V\u03b41 T cells seem to recognize CD1c through the TCR and/or MIC-A/B stress-molecules through the NKG2D receptor [3]. In contrast, human V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells are the main blood/lymphoid organ \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell subpopulation and typically recognize phosphomonoester molecules synthesized in the mevalonate and DOXP metabolic pathways [4].

            "text": "The involvement of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in antiviral immunosurveillance has been extensively analyzed (Table 1\n). A large number of studies indicate that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells participate in immune responses against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (reviewed in [5]) and other retrovirus such as the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) type 1 [6], [7], the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) [8] and the murine leukemia virus (MuLV) [9], [10]. An extrathymic expansion of a TCR-\u03b4 clonotype among V\u03b45 T cells was found to correlate with the presence of an endogenous MuLV in inbred mice [10]. A genotype-independent extrathymic expansion of a \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell subset (V\u03b39V\u03b42) has also been reported in human and non-human primates [11], [12]. Upon SIV infection of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), transient increases in the percentage of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells were observed [13]. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells from SIV-infected macaques appear to express more activation markers, such as CD69, CD44 and the memory marker CD45RO, differently from uninfected animals. The simian \u03b3\u03b4 T cells were also able to suppress SIV replication in vitro, assessed by p27 antigenemia [8]. Significant increases in \u03b3\u03b4 T cells eluted from the rectal mucosa were observed in \u2018protected\u2019 versus SIV-infected macaques [14]. After vaccination with attenuated SIV, the protection against pathogenic virus at the mucosal challenge site was accompanied by an expansion of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells concomitantly with dendritic cells [15]. Investigations of the mechanism of protection have revealed that simian \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can generate antiviral factors RANTES, MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2, which prevent SIV infection by competing for the CCR5 co-receptors. Similarly, in Homo sapiens, several studies suggest a potent antiviral activity of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells against HIV. Human V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells exert both cytolytic [16], [17] and non-cytolytic (through the induction of \u03b2-chemokines such as MIP-1\u03b1/\u03b2 and RANTES) antiviral activity. The efficacy of inhibition is comparable to that of CD8+ T lymphocytes [17], [18], [19], [20]. Moreover, human V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells have been shown to release \u03b1-defensin [21] and other, yet unidentified, non-cytolytic antiviral factors [22].",

These increases are due to the V\u03b41 T-cell subset, resulting in an inversion of the adult peripheral blood V\u03b42 to V\u03b41 ratio (>2 in HIV-seronegative controls) [25], [26]. Augmented representation of the V\u03b41 T-cell subset in the peripheral blood of HIV-seropositive persons is independent of particular \u03b3-chain expression, not correlated with a CDR3-dependent V\u03b41 selection [26], not associated with any particular junctional motifs [26], and not correlated with high levels of HIV-1 antigenemia [25]. Moreover, the comparison between mucosal and blood \u03b3\u03b4 T cells revealed a similar increase in V\u03b41 T cells [27]. In both compartments, antiretroviral treatments were not able to restore V\u03b41 T cells to normal levels [27], [28], indicating that factors other than HIV replication are responsible for the V\u03b41 T-cell expansion. An increased expression of \u2018natural killer receptors\u2019 was found on V\u03b41 T cells from HIV patients [29]. This may be due to chronic activation of V\u03b41 T cells in HIV-1-infected persons. These cells are able to lyse uninfected bystander CD4+ T cells during HIV infection [30], indicating that the V\u03b41 T-cell subset may directly contribute to the HIV-associated immunopathogenesis.",

            "text": "The HIV-associated V\u03b41 T-cell increase is accompanied by a polyclonal V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cell decrease, in both the peripheral blood and the mucosal tissues. This situation is even more evident in HIV patients with opportunistic and other co-infections [26], [27], [31], [32]. The low numbers of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells remaining after HIV infections are frequently anergic [32]. Although influencing the cytokine production of normal V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells, neither interleukin-12 (IL-12) nor IL-15 were able to reverse the V\u03b42 T-cell anergy observed in HIV-infected patients [33]. Although the spectrotype analysis of V\u03b42 and V\u03b41 did not reveal significant differences in HIV+ individuals compared to uninfected controls [26], [32], significant changes have been observed in the V\u03b39 (V\u03b32 in an alternate nomenclature) chain repertoire. Among all possible combinations of V\u03b39 with any of the four known J\u03b3 segments, healthy adults preferentially express the V\u03b39 and J\u03b3P chain combination [34], [35]. This pairing is also associated with the strongest responses to nonpeptidic antigens (NpAgs), even though the response is still polyclonal [36]. Typically, V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells stimulated with NpAgs mainly exhibit J\u03b3P rearrangements (alternatively known as J\u03b31.2) [36]. Also, gene transfer studies have shown that the V\u03b39-J\u03b3P combination is associated with the strong NpAg responsiveness, whereas V\u03b39V\u03b42 TCRs containing the other V\u03b39-J\u03b3 combinations appear to be somewhat less responsive. The lysine residues within the J\u03b3P segment are unique and absent in other human J\u03b3 segments. Mutations of these lysine residues completely abrogated the responsiveness to NpAgs without affecting the response to anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) [37]. This suggests that the positively charged lysine residues in the TCR\u03b3 CDR3 region encoded by the germline J\u03b3P segment play a key role in the response to NpAgs. HIV-infected individuals have substantially reduced numbers of V\u03b39 cells with the V\u03b39-J\u03b3P rearrangement [38]. This alteration and the reduced T-cell reactivities were shown to be partially reversed towards \u2018normal levels\u2019 during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) treatment [31], [39]. The depletion of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells is the earliest known TCR-specific cell deletion associated with HIV infection. Importantly, the loss of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells may be a contributing factor in the establishment of viral persistence in AIDS by reducing the level of type 1 cytokines [38]. In HIV-infected persons undergoing structured treatment interruption (STI) [40], a loss in circulating V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells has been observed, suggesting that acute HIV replication may influence V\u03b39V\u03b42 homeostasis. Specifically, the reduction in \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell numbers was evident in the effector CD45RA-CD27-V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cell subset. In addition, NpAg-driven interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) production was substantially decreased during the STI. After HAART resumption and the ensuing inhibition of HIV replication, the V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cell reactivities were restored. Altogether, these observations indicate that V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells are activated soon after the initiation of active HIV replication, but are rapidly lost in HIV-infected persons who fail to control viremia. In this context, it is noteworthy that the V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cell loss observed after the STI-induced increase in plasma HIV-RNA could mimic the status found in the very early phases of HIV infection. In summary, these data indicate that soon after plasma HIV-RNA rebound, the V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cell subset becomes rapidly anergic and subsequently depleted. The mechanism of this loss may involve activation-induced cell death of reactive clones triggered by Fas/FasL interactions [41] or by NpAgs [42]. Thus, the antiviral potential of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells is rapidly diminished by HIV replication. Furthermore, the increase in the V\u03b41 subset may not result from a clonal expansion in response to HIV\u2014rather it may be a bystander effect induced by cytokine changes occurring during the HIV disease progression. In addition, HIV-related molecules may interfere with \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell homeostasis, since HIV-1 Tat seems to compete for chemokine binding to CXCR3 and CXCR4 receptors expressed on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [43].",

Intrahepatic T lymphocytes from patients with chronic hepatitis C with a high histology activity index score in the liver carried mostly \u03b3\u03b4 TCR [51]. Liver \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell lines from HCV-infected individuals exhibit high levels of MHC-unrestricted cytotoxic activity against different targets, including primary hepatocytes, and produce IFN-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and IL-8 following activation by anti-CD3. These liver \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell lines do not recognize any of the structural or nonstructural proteins of HCV and have no cytotoxic activity against cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing different HCV proteins. However, the cross-linking of CD81 (which binds HCV particles and E2) results in significant IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 production by liver \u03b3\u03b4 T cells. Moreover, the V\u03b41 T-cell subset is polyclonally activated and recruited in the liver of chronic HCV-infected patients [52]. During chronic HCV infection, this T-cell subset may release Th1 cytokines and thus contribute to the inflammatory and necrotic processes in the liver. HIV/HCV co-infected patients show an increased frequency of both peripheral and intrahepatic V\u03b41 natural T lymphocytes. This may result in a higher degree of hepatic inflammation in comparison with patients with other liver diseases [28]. Altogether, these findings suggest that V\u03b41 T cells may play a role in the HCV-associated liver pathology [46]. In contrast, the V\u03b39V\u03b42 T-cell decrease may contribute to the impaired cellular immune response and the persistent nature of HCV disease [48]. In chronic HCV infection, similarly to the HIV infection, a V\u03b42/V\u03b41 T-cell impairment (e.g. intrahepatic V\u03b41 T cells are expanded in the course of disease) is also observed. The V\u03b42 T-cell deficit may be associated with persistent viral infections in humans [53].",

There is no convincing evidence that GBV-C infection causes any human pathology. Nevertheless, the current interest in GBV-C has been fuelled by reports indicating that HIV-infected patients co-infected with GBV-C have a slower disease progression. A recent study among HIV-infected mothers from South Africa shows that mothers co-infected with GBV-C have a higher percentage of circulating \u03b3\u03b4 T cells than HIV-infected mothers without GBV-C infection [49], [54]. However, in our cohort of HIV-infected patients, we have found no correlation between V\u03b42 T-cell exhaustion/V\u03b41 T-cell increase and GBV-C co-infection (Martini et al., Clin. Infect. Dis. 40 (2005) 326\u2013328). Perhaps future studies that investigate the association between circulating \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell frequencies and GBV-C load in particular clinical settings may elucidate whether or not the \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell increases are directly related to GBV-C infection.",

Adoptive transfer of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells to TCR\u03b4\u2013/\u2013 mice reduced the susceptibility of these mice to WNV, and this effect was primarily due to IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells.

In the mouse model, the epithelial T-cell response to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is dominated by \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, with very few \u03b3\u03b4 T cells being present [58]. In H. sapiens, mitogen-stimulated \u03b3\u03b4 T cells from the peripheral blood of infants with acute RSV infection produce significantly less IFN-\u03b3 and more IL-4 than \u03b3\u03b4 T cells from infants with acute reovirus infection [55]. During convalescence, the percentage of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells producing IFN-\u03b3 increases in children who recovered fully, but not in children who developed post-bronchiolitic wheezing. This suggests that cytokine production by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells during acute RSV infection may play a role in the development of recurrent wheeze after RSV infection. \u03b3\u03b4 T cells form a minority of lung-infiltrating lymphocytes in mice infected by Sendai virus [59], a paramyxovirus that causes nonfatal pneumonia. The V\u03b31/2 phenotype is prevalent throughout the course of Sendai virus infection, with a transition to the V\u03b34 phenotype preponderance occurring very late in the resolution of inflammation. In measles paramyxovirus infection, the expansion of human V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells in vitro is negatively regulated by the measles virus glycoproteins [60], and this viral immunomodulation depends on the interaction of virus glycoproteins with surface molecules present on \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and monocytes.",

After 1 week of influenza A infection, the inflammatory exudate in the lungs consisted largely of macrophages and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, with an early increase in V\u03b34 T cells and a late increase in V\u03b32/V\u03b31 T cells. Since increasing numbers of macrophages expressing heat-shock protein (HSP) mRNA were found, the increase in V\u03b32/V\u03b31 T cells is consistent with the possibility that at least some of these lymphocytes are responding to the HSP-positive cells during the resolution of inflammatory process [56], [63]. A \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell hybridoma established from influenza virus-infected mice responded both to influenza virus-infected stimulators and to recombinant HSP60. Interestingly, an HSP60-reactive hybridoma obtained from an uninfected mouse also responded to influenza virus-infected cells, indicating that HSP60 could indeed be the target antigen [64]. The TCR variable \u03b3-gene usage in the buccal epithelium of normal mice and that of mice challenged locally with influenza virus infection are different. In the control mice, there is a restricted use of V\u03b3 genes by buccal \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (consisting primarily of V\u03b31.2, V\u03b33, and V\u03b35). Expression of the V\u03b32 and V\u03b35 genes is diminished in influenza-infected mice, but expression of other V\u03b3 genes does not appear to be altered by the infection. A local challenge with BSA is followed by a decreased expression of V\u03b31.2, V\u03b33, and V\u03b35 genes, and to a lesser extent, V\u03b32 gene, whereas V\u03b34 gene expression is increased. It is possible to speculate that the immunomodulating effect of oral antigen exposure on buccal \u03b3\u03b4 T cells suggests that these cells are functionally involved in the local immune response to replicating and non-replicating antigens in oral mucosal surfaces [57].",

            "text": "\u03b3\u03b4 T cells have been studied in the immune response to other RNA viruses such as coxsackieviruses, murine coronaviruses, and vesicular stomatitis virus. A role of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells has been demonstrated in coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis [70], [71]. Cells expressing the \u03b3\u03b4 TCR accounted for 5\u201313% of lymphocytes infiltrating the hearts of coxsackievirus H3 (CVB3)-infected mice, and adoptive transfer of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells produces IFN-\u03b3-induced myocarditis by apoptosis [72]. The pathogenic \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell response is linked to MHC class II haplotype, since animals lacking the MHC class II IE antigen develop minimal cardiac lesions subsequent to infection, despite high concentrations of virus in the heart. The susceptibility to myocarditis correlates with a Th1 (IFN-\u03b3-positive) cell response in the spleen, whereas disease resistance is associated with the Th2 (IL-4 positive) phenotype. \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell analysis indicates that distinct cell subpopulations are activated after CVB3 infection in resistant and susceptible mice. Depletion of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells abrogates myocarditis susceptibility in IE+ animals and results in a Th1 versus Th2 phenotype shift [73]. It appears that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells modulate T-cell responses by selectively lysing CD4+ Th2 cells. Lysis requires direct cell-to-cell interaction between the \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell and the CD4+ Th2 target, and is most likely mediated through Fas/FasL interaction [74]. The heart infiltrate in CVB3-infected myocarditis-susceptible mice contains abundant V\u03b31 T cells, whereas heart-infiltrating V\u03b34 T cells are plentiful in myocarditis-resistant mice. Interestingly, the mAb-induced depletion of V\u03b31 T cells potentiates myocarditis, whereas the mAb-induced depletion of V\u03b34 T cells leads to suppression of myocarditis. V\u03b34-cell transfer experiments in myocarditis-resistant mice show that the V\u03b34 subset promotes myocarditis. Th subset analyses suggest that V\u03b31 T cells induce a dominant Th2-cell response, whereas V\u03b34 T cells bring on a dominant Th1-cell response [75]. Infection with a myocarditis-inducing strain (H3) of CVB3 preferentially activates V\u03b34V\u03b44 cells, which are strongly positive for IFN-\u03b3, whereas V\u03b31V\u03b44 cells are increased in both myocarditis-inducing strain (H3)- and myocarditis-non-inducing strain (H310A1)-infected animals [76]. In this model system, the CD1 molecule is required for stimulation of V\u03b44 cells. The activated V\u03b44 cells initiate myocarditis through a IFN-\u03b3-mediated induction of Th1 cells that in turn activate autoimmune CD8+ \u03b1\u03b2 T effector response. The activated V\u03b44 cells can adoptively transfer myocarditis to animals infected with a nonmyocarditic variant, but not to either uninfected or CD1(\u2013/\u2013) recipients. This demonstrates that the V\u03b44 myocarditic function requires both infection and CD1 expression. In contrast, CD8+ \u03b1\u03b2 T cells transfer myocarditis into either infected CD1(\u2013/\u2013) or uninfected recipients, showing that the function of these activated CD8 effectors is both virus- and CD1-independent. Thus, V\u03b44 cells influence CVB3 pathogenicity by their ability to manipulate both the CD4 and CD8 adaptive immune response [77].",

In particular, many studies describe a protective role of \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes in the immunosurveillance against herpesviruses in both rodents and people. In the murine model of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, a \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell clone recognizing glycoprotein I of HSV type 1 without the requirement of expression of MHC class I or class II gene products has been isolated [81], [82], [83]. Studies of HSV disease course in TCR-\u03b3\u03b4- or TCR-\u03b1\u03b2-deficient mice have shown that \u03b3\u03b4 T cells limit severe HSV-1-induced epithelial lesions and greatly reduce mortality by preventing the development of lethal viral encephalitis. This protection is due to a \u03b3\u03b4 T cell-mediated arrest of both viral replication and neurovirulence [84]. After corneal HSV infection in mice, \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes are able to infiltrate the trigeminal ganglion. These cells produce IFN-\u03b3, suggesting a direct role of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the control of virus replication through the production of such antiviral molecules [85].",

To mediate the lytic activity, these virus-specific CTLs require the expression of HLA class I molecules on the surface of target cells [86]. However, the response itself appears to be HLA-unrestricted, suggesting the possible involvement of NK receptors expressed by human \u03b3\u03b4 T cells [87], [88], [89], [90]. Specifically, PBMC from HSV-seropositive individuals stimulated with autologous HSV-infected PHA blasts show an expansion of V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells, and are able to lyse HSV-infected, but not mock-infected targets. Also, V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells obtained after PHA or mycobacterial stimulation are able to lyse HSV-infected as well as unrelated vaccinia-infected targets, but not mock-infected targets [91]. Similarly to the mouse models, human \u03b3\u03b4 T cell-mediated cytotoxic activity is not restricted by classical HLA class I or class II molecules, and can be blocked by mAbs to CD3 and the \u03b3\u03b4 TCR. Interestingly, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have been shown to be susceptible to human herpes virus (HHV)-6 infection, and display cytolytic activities against both autologous and heterologous target cells infected with HHV-6. HHV-6 infection induces CD4 expression in \u03b3\u03b4 T lymphocytes, rendering them susceptible to HIV [92]. Thus, HHV-6 has evolved strategies to interfere with \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell antiviral activities, exploiting the activation of these cells to expand the pool of target cells susceptible to productive infection. Lymphocytes bearing \u03b3\u03b4 TCRs are expanded during other herpesvirus infections, such as the acute phase of Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV)-induced infectious mononucleosis. These \u03b3\u03b4 T cells express activation antigens, such as HLA-DR and CD38, and persist during the convalescent phase of infectious mononucleosis, suggesting a possible role of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the control of primary EBV infection [93]. A large proportion of human sinovial tissue- and peripheral blood-derived V\u03b41 T-cell clones can proliferate in response to stimulation with autologous and allogeneic EBV-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). This proliferative response is dependent on contact between responder and stimulator cells, and can be blocked by a mAb to LFA-1 and by antibodies to the \u03b3\u03b4 TCR/CD3 complex [94]. In subsequent studies, the nature of the stimulatory ligand was found to be of cellular rather than of viral origin, and its expression was upregulated upon activation of B cells. Moreover, the expression of B7 and CD39 molecules on the surface of activated B cells appears to be crucial, since antibodies to these structures can block the induction of V\u03b41 T-cell proliferation. Finally, no predominant V\u2013D\u2013J sequences have been found among the LCL-responsive V\u03b41 T-cell clones, arguing strongly against a mono- or oligoclonal V\u03b41 T-cell response to LCL [95].",

The \u03b3\u03b4 T cells show an activated T-cell phenotype, largely expressed V\u03b31, and may recognize the HSP65. M-CMV-induced \u03b3\u03b4 T cells express IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, but not IL-4, and are able to produce IFN-\u03b3 in vitro in response to HSP65. Moreover, depletion of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells by anti-TCR \u03b3\u03b4 mAb treatment results in a significant increase in virus titer and a parallel decrease in IFN-\u03b3 in the liver on day 3 after M-CMV infection. This further supports the importance of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in early protection against infection [96]. In another study, the phenotypic and functional characteristics of leukocytes infiltrating the submaxillary gland (SMG) were analyzed in CMV-infected BALB/c mice. A robust innate immune response comprising CD11c+ MHC II+ CD11b\u2013 CD8\u03b1+ dendritic cells and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells was prominent through at least 28 days post-infection. The expression of IFN-\u03b3, IL-10 and CC chemokines was extraordinarily high in the SMG in response to M-CMV infection, indicating that innate and acquired immune responses are quite vigorous in the SMG of CMV-infected mice [97]. In a rat model, the accumulation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in regional popliteal lymph nodes (PLN) starts 2 days after inoculation of CMV into the footpad. PLN \u03b3\u03b4 T cells inhibit the plaque development and the spread of CMV infection, are negative for CD4 and CD8 receptors, proliferate in response to IL-2, and contain high levels of IFN-\u03b3. The IFN-\u03b3 positivity correlates with the curing of fibroblasts from virus infection [98].",

This increase is associated with the activation of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells expressing mainly the V\u03b41 or V\u03b43 TCR chains. Analyses of TCR junctional diversity revealed that H-CMV infection is accompanied by a selective expansion of V\u03b41 T cells bearing recurrent junctional amino acid motifs, suggesting an in vivo antigen-driven selection of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell subsets during the course of H-CMV infection [99]. Both V\u03b41 and V\u03b43 T cells from H-CMV-infected kidney recipients are able to proliferate in vitro in the presence of free CMV virions or CMV-infected fibroblast lysates, but not in the presence of uninfected or other herpesvirus-infected fibroblast lysates. This suggests that a population of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells may play an important role in immune responses to H-CMV infections. The relationship between the evolution of CMV infection and the kinetics of \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell amplification has been followed up to 10 months after transplantation. Patients with late \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell expansions (\u226545 days) have significantly longer (P < 0.0001) and higher (P < 0.0003) pp65 antigenemia and are more symptomatic than patients with early expansions. Moreover, single patient analyses have shown that \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell expansions parallel the resolution of CMV infection, strongly supporting the idea of a protective role of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in H-CMV infections [100].",

Mice deficient in \u03b3\u03b4 T cells have significantly higher VV titers and increased mortality in comparison with normal mice. There is a rapid and profound VV-induced increase in IFN-\u03b3-producing \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the peritoneal cavity and spleen of \u03b1\u03b2-TCR-deficient VV-infected mice. This rapid response occurs in the absence of priming, and there are substantial numbers of VV-specific \u03b3\u03b4 T cells present in uninfected mice. These cells express a constitutive cytolytic activity, which is increased after VV infection. VV-infected \u03b1\u03b2-deficient mice show a transient control of VV replication on the day of the \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell response peak, but thereafter \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell numbers decline, and the virus infection recrudesces. Thus, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can be mediators of innate immunity to viruses, having a significant impact on virus replication in the presence or absence of adaptive immune responses [102].",

These augmented \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell responses are specific for canarypox virus, but not for HIV antigens, and are mediated primarily by IFN-\u03b3-producing V\u03b39 T cells. \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell lines generated from canarypox vaccinees respond to canarypox antigens but not to mycobacterial antigens.

The molecules recognized by \u03b3\u03b4 T cells during viral infections are probably of cellular rather than viral origin and appear to be metabolites of altered cellular pathways, in particular the products of the mevalonate pathway. Moreover, virus-exposed \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can be rapidly activated by type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2), a phenomenon that is likely to contribute to the effective antiviral response [104]. The antiviral role of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells has been intensively studied in mice and correlated with the production of IFN-\u03b3 by distinct \u03b3\u03b4 T-cell subsets. In H. sapiens, V\u03b41 T cells are systemically or locally expanded in some chronic viral infections and are probably involved in the accompanying inflammatory processes. V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cells are activated early during the acute phase of most viral infections and can display potent antiviral responses. Moreover, a plethora of soluble factors with antiviral characteristics induced by V\u03b39V\u03b42-stimulatory molecules can influence the outcome of viral infections. In addition to their direct antiviral properties, many of these molecules play crucial immunoregulatory roles and are decisive in controlling the complex antiviral immunosurveillance function as well as in establishing the correct immunological memory environment in vivo.",
