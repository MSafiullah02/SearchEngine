They now inhabit virtually every terrestrial habitat, except Antarctica. More than 1700 species have been described to date (Stockmann and Ythier, 2010). The key to their success is the production of potent venoms that they use primarily to kill or paralyze their preys and to deter possible competitors and predators. The expansion of human civilization and the growth of human population have led to increased interaction with these arthropods, frequently resulting in accidents when people get stung (Chippaux and Goyffon, 2008). The immediate pain that the sting elicits and the devastating consequences that the envenomation can ultimately cause in human beings can be credited for the bad reputation of these animals.",

            "text": "The effects of a scorpion sting can vary widely, from just local pain or inflammation to severe clinical complications, including death. The severity of scorpion envenomation is related to the presence of neurotoxins in the venom (see recent review: Quintero-Hernandez et al., 2013). They can block or modify the functioning of their targeted ion channels in excitable cells, which results in autonomic excitation. Scorpion \u03b1-toxins cause massive endogenous release of catecholamines. The combination of sympathetic excitation and the release of catecholamines in plasma generates a cascade of physiological events that can progress to arterial hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia, arrhythmia, unconsciousness, pulmonary edema, heart failure and death (Isbister and Bawaskar, 2014). Scorpionism represents a major health problem in several countries. More than 1.2 million scorpion stings are registered globally every year. Despite the fact that only about 30 scorpion species are known to be dangerous to humans, about 3000 stings per year are fatal (Chippaux, 2012).",

With the advent of novel methodologies for the massive study and characterization of venom components, it has become evident that along with toxins, many other peptides are present in the scorpion venoms. Several of these peptides are biologically active and have proven to be valuable tools for the development of drugs for the treatment of many important diseases.",

Several pathogens that were once sensible to antibiotics are now rapidly becoming multi-resistant. Diverse bacterial mechanisms are responsible for the appearance of multi-resistance, including their rapid generation rates and chromosomal mutations, the acquisition of extra-chromosomal mobile DNA elements from other bacteria in the surroundings, together with some intrinsic mechanisms conferring the capacity to expel antibiotics from the cells (Alekshun and Levy, 2007). Once a multi-resistant organism emerges, it spreads in the human population, severely compromising the treatment of infections and thus provoking public health crises. This has reduced the long-term therapeutic value of many classical antibiotics and has forced the search for new antimicrobial candidates able to cope with the bacterial mechanisms of drug resistance (Gould and Bal, 2013).",

More than 2000 have already been described (Wang et al., 2009). In multicellular organisms they constitute primitive and conserved components of the innate immune system, functioning as a first barrier against many pathogens. Thanks to their broad spectrum of activities and targets, rapid action, and the low potential to induce resistance, AMPs have become promising prospects for new antibiotics (Huang et al., 2010, Mookherjee and Hancock, 2007). They kill microbes mainly by membrane-targeting pore-forming mechanisms that are inherently more difficult for microbes to circumvent by developing resistance (Hancock and Sahl, 2006). A significant fraction of the functionally characterized scorpion venom NDBPs displays antimicrobial activities, so they can be considered as AMPs (Almaaytah and Albalas, 2014, Harrison et al., 2014). It is not clear why they are present in the scorpion venom. They could play a synergistic role in facilitating venom activity or be part of the antimicrobial response within the venom gland (Kuhn-Nentwig, 2003). The pair of venom glands present in the last postabdominal segment (telson) of the scorpions has open communication with the environment, which can facilitate contamination by saprophytic organisms of the soil. Thus, scorpions are expected to possess means of defending themselves from the microorganisms present in the environment.",

            "text": "The first AMPs found in scorpion venoms were hadrurin from Hadrurus aztecus (now renamed as Hadrurus gertschi) (Torres-Larios et al., 2000), scorpine (Conde et al., 2000) and pandinins (Corzo et al., 2001) from Pandinus imperator, IsCTs from Opisthacanthus madagascariensis (Dai et al., 2001), opistoporins from Opistophtalmus carinatus and parabutoporin from Parabuthus schlechteri (Moerman et al., 2002). The main drawback of AMPs in general, is their frequent cytotoxicity against eukaryotic cells, which limits their clinical applications. This is a problem shared by scorpion AMPs. For many scorpion NDBPs the potential therapeutic concentration (the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration, MIC) against the tested microorganisms is very close to the concentration at which they are cytotoxic to mammalian cells (usually measured in erythrocyte hemolysis assays). For example, hadrurin, the first scorpion NDBP shown to display antibacterial activity, was able to inhibit the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with a MIC of 10\u201350 \u03bcM, but was also highly hemolytic to human erythrocytes at 30 \u03bcM (Torres-Larios et al., 2000). This antimicrobial-hemolytic duality repeated itself for almost all scorpion AMPs described to date. It is for this reason that they were first proposed as prospective antimicrobials for topical applications only (Zeng et al., 2005). Nevertheless, some NDBPs showed a relatively mild cytotoxic effect, which improves their therapeutic index (the ratio given by the toxic dose divided by the therapeutic dose). The first example was Pandinin1, which effectively inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria with a MIC of 2\u20136 \u03bcM, while keeping hemolysis very low at concentrations of up to 21 \u03bcM (1.4%, essayed on sheep erythrocytes) (Corzo et al., 2001). BmKbpp is a multifunctional peptide from the scorpion Mesobuthus martensii Karsch, with antimicrobial, immune-regulatory and bradykinin-potentiating activities (see below). BmKbpp demonstrated strong antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria with a MIC range of 2.3\u20134.7 \u03bcM. It was also active against a few Gram-positive bacteria, but with higher MIC. Its hemolytic activity can be considered to be mild, with 40% hemolysis of human erythrocytes at the relatively high 50 \u03bcM concentration (Zeng et al., 2012). VmCT1, an antimicrobial peptide synthesized from the precursor DNA sequence found in a cDNA library from Vaejovis mexicanus smithi, was effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with a MIC of 5\u201325 \u03bcM, and showed only mild hemolysis (12% against human erythrocytes) at an even higher concentration of 50 \u03bcM (Ramirez-Carreto et al., 2012). Pantinin-1, recently characterized from the scorpion P. imperator by the cDNA cloning strategy, was active against Gram-positive bacteria with a MIC of 8\u201332 \u03bcM. Pantinin-1 showed no hemolysis at MIC and only mild hemolysis at the higher concentration of 64 \u03bcM (21%, human erythrocytes) (Zeng et al., 2013). These three examples demonstrate that natural scorpion AMPs can be found with good therapeutic indexes. They are by themselves good candidates for antimicrobial drug development.",

            "text": "The remaining AMPs found in scorpion venoms for which the hemolysis activities were assayed, were reported as highly hemotoxic. This does not mean that they are not valuable in the search for alternative antibiotics. Several studies have shown that the potential of AMPs for clinical applications can be optimized by improving their antimicrobial activity and reducing their toxicity against human cells (Fjell et al., 2012, Huang et al., 2010). This has also been demonstrated with scorpion AMPs. Analogs of natural scorpion AMPs could be potential anti-infective drugs, even for treating antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Mucroporin, an antimicrobial peptide synthesized from a sequence found in a cDNA library from Lychas mucronatus, was moderately effective against Gram-positive bacterial strains, including clinically isolated pathogens. An engineered peptide, Mucroporin-M1, was designed from the sequence of Mucroporin by replacing the amino acid residues at the hydrophilic side of the predicted \u03b1-helix with positively charged residues. Mucroporin-M1 showed improved antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and clinically isolated antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS), penicillin-resistant S. aureus (PRSA) and penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (PRSE) (Dai et al., 2008). The same group applied a similar approach to produce a potent variant of BmKn2, an antimicrobial peptide derived from the venom of the scorpion M. martensii Karsch (Zeng et al., 2004). The Kn2-7 variant showed increased inhibitory activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, being even more effective against clinical antibiotic-resistant strains of MRSA, MRCNS, PRSA and PRSE, than the original BmKn2. The hemolytic activity of Kn2-7 was also significantly improved. The HC50 value of the wild-type peptide BmKn2 (90 \u03bcg/ml) was drastically decreased for the mutant peptide Kn2-7 (17 \u03bcg/ml). It is even more relevant that, in an S. aureus mouse skin infection model, the topical application of Kn2-7 effectively protected the skin of mice from infection (Cao et al., 2012). These two examples demonstrate that the native scorpion AMPs can also be effectively used as scaffolds for the design of more potent and specific antibiotics.",

            "text": "Contrary to classical antibiotics, the ligand-independent mechanism of bactericidal action of most AMPs implies that they are likely to be effective against clinical strains of antibiotic-resistant and multi-resistant pathogens. Within the scorpion AMPs this capacity was demonstrated for Mucroporin-M1, BmKn2 and its Kn2-7 variant, as mentioned above, and the following ones. Imcroporin, derived from a cDNA library of the scorpion Isometrus maculates, was the first peptide of scorpion venom origin to show potent antimicrobial activity against antibiotic resistant gram-positive pathogen strains such as MRSA, MRCNS and PRSE. The MIC of imcroporin against the PRSE (50 \u03bcg/ml) was 20-fold lower than that of penicillin G. Against MRSA and MRCNS strains (also 50 \u03bcg/ml) it was two- and eight-fold lower than the MIC of cefotaxime, respectively. Significantly, the in vivo activity of imcroporin was also demonstrated in a mouse model infected with S. aureus. A 60 mg/kg dose of imcroporin was able to cope with 10 LD50 of intraperitoneally injected bacteria, with a 100% survival ratio, a result equivalent to the use of the same dose of vancomycin (Zhao et al., 2009). Ctriporin is a potent antimicrobial peptide identified from a cDNA library of Chaerilus tricostatus. Ctriporin was effective against MRSA with a MIC of 10 \u03bcg/ml, 400 to 2000 times better than penicillin G and 10 to 40 times better than cefotaxime. Against PRSE, with a MIC of 10 \u03bcg/ml, it was 1000 times more effective than penicillin G. Ctriporin was effective when used as a topical antibiotic treatment in an S. aureus mouse skin wound infection model (Fan et al., 2011). Vejovine is an antimicrobial peptide purified from the venom of the scorpion V. mexicanus smithi. Vejovine inhibited growth of clinical isolates of Gram-negative multidrug resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii, with MICs of 4.4\u201350 \u03bcM. This peptide also displayed hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes with a HC50 of 100 \u03bcM (Hernandez-Aponte et al., 2011). Recently, using a rational approach, several variants were designed using vejovine and its homolog hadrurin as templates, with the aim of improving their antimicrobial and hemolytic properties. Indeed, the variants resulted more potent than the parental peptides against the same Gram-negative multidrug resistant strains (with MICs of 0.8\u201325 \u03bcM), and also less hemolytic (HC50 up to 900 \u03bcM), which represents a dramatic improvement in their therapeutic indexes (Sanchez-Vasquez et al., 2013). This work constitutes an encouraging example of the results that can be achieved by the rational design of novel prospective antimicrobial peptides with potential clinical applications using the natural scorpion AMPs as scaffolds.",

Many immunocompromised patients are highly susceptible to fungal infections: transplant recipients under immunosuppressive therapy, cancer patients treated with cytotoxic drugs, and AIDS patients. The most important fungal pathogens are the yeasts of the genus Candida, Cryptococcus neoformans, and the mold Aspergillus fumigatus. Infections caused by these fungi range from superficial mucosal infections, like oral candidiasis, to life-threatening systemic infections, such as disseminated candidiasis, cryptococcal meningitis or invasive aspergillosis (Sternberg, 1994). Fungi can become resistant to antifungal drugs by specific mechanisms or by more generic ones, e.g., by actively transporting them out of the cell through multidrug efflux pumps (Morschhauser, 2010).

Global morbidity and mortality from malaria has decreased substantially in the last years, but still roughly 2000 people die every day from Plasmodium falciparum infection. Two factors are largely responsible for these decrements: increased deployment of insecticide-treated bednets and increased availability of highly effective artemisinin combination treatments. The effort to eradicate malaria faces many challenges, including the development of pyrethroid resistance in some Anopheles mosquitoes, and the emergence of artemisinin resistance in P. falciparum in Southeast Asia (White et al., 2014). One of the driving forces in the appearance of resistance is the exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies for many years.

In the first one, clones from a cDNA library from the scorpion Mesobuthus eupeus venom gland were identified, which encode for NDBPs meucin-24 and meucin-25. Though not related to each other in terms of structure or sequence, both synthetic peptides were able to inhibit the development of P. berghei ookinetes in the concentration range from 10 to 20 \u03bcM. Moreover, they were able to actually kill intraerythrocytic P. falciparum at a concentration of 10 \u03bcM. They significantly reduced parasite density 48 h post-treatment, and completely eliminated the parasite from the erythrocytes after 72 h. Remarkably, meucin-24 and meucin-25 were selective against Plasmodium with no detected toxicity to bacteria and fungi at the concentrations used. Also, no hemolytic effect on mouse erythrocytes was registered even at 100 \u03bcM concentration (Gao et al., 2010). Meucin-24 and meucin-25 are undoubtedly strong candidates for antimalarial therapies. The other report involved the above-mentioned AMPs derived from vejovine and hadrurin, which displayed antibacterial activity. When their antimalarial activity was tested, the results showed that some of the designed variants inhibited the formation of ookinetes from P. berghei by 40% at 5 \u03bcM, doubling this percentage when the concentration was increased to 25 \u03bcM (Sanchez-Vasquez et al., 2013).",

Traditionally, vaccine development has been an extremely effective strategy to protect from specific viral infections. The problem is that a functional vaccine cannot be produced until sufficient quantities of the emerging virus are available for vaccine manufacture. And the manufacturing process itself takes precious time. This implies that the population cannot be protected with a specific product for a length of time. In addition, newly emerging viruses frequently exhibit gene rearrangements, and each individual viral strain must be first identified and characterized, since unfortunately, very often, the vaccines against a particular infectious strain do not protect against a rearranged one (Burke and Fish, 2009). This situation highlights the relevance of the development of more generic antiviral therapeutics.",

            "text": "A few scorpion peptides display themselves as effective antiviral peptides (AVP). The first reported one was Hp1090, discovered in a cDNA library from the venomous gland of the scorpion Heterometrus petersii. Hp1090 inhibited hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in vitro, with an IC50 of 5 \u03bcM. At roughly 13 \u03bcM, Hp1090 inhibited the amplification of HCV RNA in Huh7.5.1 cells with a higher potency than IFN-\u03b1. Hp1090 prevents the initiation of HCV infection by directly interacting with viral particles and rapidly disrupting their phospholipid membranes (Yan et al., 2011). This AVP is a very good candidate for the development of a therapeutic agent for hepatitis C. The optimized mucroporin-M1 was mentioned before in regard to its antimicrobial activity. Besides that, mucroporin-M1 also demonstrated antiviral activities against measles virus (EC50 of 3.52 \u03bcM), against the SARS coronavirus (EC50 of 7.12 \u03bcM), and against Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 (EC50 of 1.03 \u03bcM). Paradoxically, the original peptide mucroporin showed no antiviral activity against any of these three viruses (Li et al., 2011). The discovery of the antiviral activities of mucroporin-M1 indicates that cationic peptides from scorpion venom could represent good candidates for the development of multifunctional antiviral agents. The already mentioned scorpion venom peptide derivative Kn2-7 was identified as a potent anti-HIV-1 peptide with an EC50 value of 1.65 \u03bcM while showing low cytotoxicity to host cells. Kn2-7 was able to inhibit all 13 members of a standard reference panel of HIV-1 subtype B pseudotyped viruses (PV) regardless of their tropism. Roughly 9 \u03bcM of Kn2-7 almost completely inhibited viral replication of both cell-free and cell-associated replication-competent HIV-1. The anti-HIV-1 activity was correlated with a direct interaction between Kn2-7 and the HIV-1 envelope, once again demonstrating that an AVP can rapidly and directly disrupt viral membranes. In this same study, BmKn2, the parental peptide of Kn2-7, and mucroporin-M1 were also shown to display anti-HIV-1 activity, though to a lesser extent (Chen et al., 2012). Ctry2459, a peptide derived from a cDNA library from the scorpion Chaerilus tryznai has been proven to inhibit HCV infection by directly inactivating infectious viral particles. However, Ctry2459 was not able to suppress an established infection due to its low bioavailability to infected cells. Based on the Ctry2459 sequence, two new histidine-rich peptides were designed, Ctry2459-H2 and Ctry2459-H3, with the aim of enhancing cellular uptake and improving intracellular distribution. The mutated peptides significantly suppressed the established HCV infection at the cellular level, while showing even lower cytotoxic and hemolytic activities than the parental peptide. This effective design strategy for enhancing the bioavailability of peptide drugs could also be applied to other AMPs and AVPs (Hong et al., 2013). Recently, two venom peptides from the scorpion H. petersii were identified with effective inhibitory effect on herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection in vitro. The Hp1036 and Hp1239 peptides exhibited potent viruscidal activities against HSV-1 (EC50 of 0.43 \u03bcM and 0.41 \u03bcM, respectively) as the result of the destruction of the viral morphology. They also showed effective inhibitory effects when added at the different stages of the HSV-1 life cycle: attachment, entry and post entry, which means that the peptides were able to enter the host cells and reduce the intracellular viral infectivity. Hp1036 and Hp1239 are also good candidates for the development of antiviral drugs.",

It increases blood vessels vasodilation and capillary permeability, and therefore causes arterial blood pressure to fall. It is a substrate for the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a proteolytic enzyme that inactivates bradykinin. ACE inhibitors are therefore valuable tools for the treatment of hypertension. The discovery of the bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs) led to the development of captopril, an ACE inhibitor derived from a peptide found in the venom of the lancehead viper Bothrops jararaca. Nowadays, millions of hypertensive patients worldwide are treated with ACE inhibitors (Camargo et al., 2012).",

Peptide T potentiated the contractile activity of bradykinin on the isolated guinea pig ileum, and inhibited the hydrolysis of bradykinin by the angiotensin-converting enzyme. It also increased the depressor effect of bradykinin on arterial blood pressure in a rat model (Ferreira et al., 1993). Peptide K12, isolated from the venom of the scorpion Buthus occitanus was able to potentiate the bradykinin effect on the isolated guinea pig ileum as well as on the isolated rat uterus. The peptide also strongly potentiated the depressor effect of bradykinin on arterial blood pressure in rats. Peptide K12 inhibited ACE, and was not proteolysed by the enzyme (Meki et al., 1995). It is very interesting that the C-terminal region of BmKbpp, the AMP peptide mentioned before, shows significant sequence similarity with the peptide K12. Indeed, BmKbpp and its C-terminal fragment (BmKbpp-C) displayed bradykinin-potentiating activity. Although less potent than peptide K12, at a concentration of 50 nM, both BmKbpp and BmKbpp-C induced significant shifts of the dose\u2013response curve of muscular contraction induced by bradykinin, with BmKbpp-C being more active than the whole peptide. This suggests that both BmKbpp and BmKbpp-C have bradykinin potentiating activity, and the activity of BmKbpp-C is stronger than that of BmKbpp (Zeng et al., 2012).",

A relevant hypotensive effect, independent of bradykinin, was also observed for both TsHpt-I and TsHpt-I[17\u201325]. These two peptides were able to induce an endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation of aortic rings from rats, a process also dependent on nitric oxide release. Hypotensins do not inhibit ACE, so other mechanisms (probably the improvement of the endothelial function) might be relevant in blood pressure control, which deserve to be more deeply studied (Verano-Braga et al., 2008).",

This toxin displays an increased affinity, approximately five times greater for Kv1.3 than that of the native peptide (Mouhat et al., 2005).

High levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in human serum have been reported after scorpion envenomation (revised in Petricevich, 2010). Scorpion venom also induces an increase in the neutrophil count in blood and a simultaneous reduction in the mature neutrophil count in the bone marrow of the rat. This blood neutrophilia is a consequence of the mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow which in turn is dependent on the activation of platelet-activating factor receptors (Borges et al., 2000).",

In the same way, increased levels of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10 were observed in sera from mice exposed to Centruroides noxius scorpion venom (Petricevich, 2006). Depending on the concentrations used, TsV, Toxin 1 (Ts1) and Toxin 6 (Ts6) stimulated the production of nitric oxide (NO), IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in J774.1 cells. Toxin 2 (Ts2) alone stimulated the production of IL-10, suggesting an anti-inflammatory activity of Ts2. These findings are important for the basic understanding of the mechanisms involved in macrophage activation following scorpion envenomation (Zoccal et al., 2011). Using knockout mice it has been demonstrated that TsV interacts with Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2, TLR4 and CD14, a cell surface receptor that cooperates with TLR4. This interaction recruits myeloid differentiation factor (MyD88) and activates the activator protein 1(AP-1) and NF-kB pathways. Similarly, Ts1 induces TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 production in a manner that is dependent on TLR2, TLR4 and CD14, although signaling occurs mainly through NF-kB activation (Zoccal et al., 2014).",

These are amphipatic \u03b1-helical peptides of 45 and 44 amino acids respectively. Both peptides are capable of inducing a reversible release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores of Ca2+ of granulocyte-like HL60 cells. The release of calcium was sensitive to Pertussis toxin, indicating that the release of Ca2+ involves G proteins (Moerman et al., 2003). It has been shown that parabutoporin inhibits the activation of the NADPH oxidase by acting as a competitive inhibitor of Protein Kinase B (Akt), thus contributing to the decline of superoxide production by human neutrophils (Remijsen et al., 2006). Parabutoporin delayed neutrophil apoptosis via lipid raft-dependent activation of Akt (Remijsen et al., 2009). It has been shown that parabutoporin also stimulates neutrophil motility through the activation of Pertussis toxin sensitive signaling pathways through the up-regulation of GTP bound Rac2 levels and possibly through the interaction of G proteins as proposed earlier (Remijsen et al., 2010). The previously mentioned BmKbpp, besides its antimicrobial and antifungal activities at micromolar concentrations, also inhibits the superoxide production in granulocytes or Hl-60 cells at sub-micromolar concentrations (Zeng et al., 2012). Parabutoporin, opistoporin and BmKbpp are long chain multifunctional peptides that have been classified (on the principles of pharmacological activity, sequence similarity and peptide length) together with hadrurin (Torres-Larios et al., 2000), pandinin1 (Corzo et al., 2001), Im-1 (Miyashita et al., 2010) vejovine (Hernandez-Aponte et al., 2011) and mauriporin (Almaaytah et al., 2013), so these last peptides might have the same functional properties as parabutoporin, opistoporin and BmKbpp (Almaaytah and Albalas, 2014). These multifunctional peptides with antimicrobial and immune-regulatory activity provide an interesting tool for pharmaceutical design.",

The last decades have seen significant progress in both the diagnosis and the therapeutic approaches for cancer treatment. Despite favorable advancements, the classical methods available today, surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, still show a relatively low success rate and a high risk of reoccurrence. The lack of adequate selectivity for tumor cells and, therefore, the unspecific targeting of healthy cells with many deleterious side effects seriously limit the effectiveness of available chemotherapeutics (Morgan et al., 2004). The search for more specific and selective anticancer drugs, either designed de novo or derived from natural compounds, will remain a very active field in the foreseeable future.",

            "text": "Chlorotoxin (ClTx, UniprotKB P45639) is a peptide containing 36 amino acids and 4 disulfide bonds, purified from the venom of the scorpion Leiurus quinquestriatus (DeBin et al., 1993). It possesses a single tyrosine residue available for radioiodination. Its solution structure, determined by NMR spectroscopy, consists of a small three-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet cross-linked to an \u03b1-helix through three disulfide bonds and the fourth one links the small N-terminal beta strand to the rest of the molecule, characterizing the peptide as a knottin (Lippens et al., 1995). The earliest study showed ClTx is able to block small-conductance Cl\u2212 channels, derived from epithelial cells (DeBin et al., 1993). Then, its binding to chloride channels specifically expressed on human astrocytoma and glioma cells was also shown (Ullrich et al., 1998, Ullrich et al., 1995, Ullrich and Sontheimer, 1996). These experiments allowed the identification of the voltage-activated chloride channels present in astrocytes. Indeed, it has been shown that ClTx inhibits these chloride channels by its binding to metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) (Deshane et al., 2003, Mamelak and Jacoby, 2007). ClTx causes the endocytosis of MMP-2 with ClC-3, a subtype of Cl\u2212 channel upregulated in glioma membranes, depleting the cell-surface of Cl-channels. ClTx effectively blocked the migration of STTGI and U251-MG human glioma cells, but ion channel depletion alone was not able to fully block glioma cell invasion (Lui et al., 2010). The ClTx-MMP-2 complex interaction has been shown to be specific to neuroectodermal cells of glioma and tumors. ClTx does not bind to normal human tissues, including neuronal cells (DeBin et al., 1993, Lyons et al., 2002). More recently it was shown that ClTx-modified liposomes are capable of significantly inhibit breast tumor 4T1 growth, an aggressive metastatic breast cancer cell line derived from a BALB/c mouse mammary tumor, which highly expresses MMP-2, as well as increasing the antimetastasis effect (Qin et al., 2014). A different vehicle, a nanocapsule exhibiting the monomeric fusion of chlorotoxin to the amino terminus of the human IgG-Fc (M-ClTx-Fc), was internalized and inhibited the migration of pancreatic cancer cells (El-Ghlban et al., 2014). Many groups have been working in the elaboration of nanoparticles conjugated with chlorotoxin specific to glioma, either to access/treat this cancer or to monitor/visualize the tumor growth (a recent revision is presented in Fu et al. (2012)). ClTx has also been used in vivo and in vitro to improve the anticancer activity of chemotherapy drugs, such as doxorubicin, an anthracycline antibiotic used to reduce or inhibit cancer cells growth (Xiang et al., 2011). ClTx was used as a ligand to direct more effectively stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALPs) transporting small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and antisense oligonucleotides (asOs) to glioblastoma both in vitro and in vivo (Costa et al., 2013). Transmolecular Industries developed a synthetic ClTx and its commercial equivalent (TM601) was approved by the FDA for clinical testing. Besides having antitumoral activity, TM601 presents anti-angiogenic properties. TM601 was able to inhibit angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo stimulated by many factors and potentiate the anti-angiogenic effect of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that attaches to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), inhibiting the establishment of new blood vessels to feed the tumor. Further, TM601 effectively inhibited neovascularization induced by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF\u03b1) whereas bevacizumab did not (Jacoby et al., 2010). In addition to the inhibition of glioma cells growth and invasion and angiogenesis in vivo, ClTx is able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) (Hockaday et al., 2005). These unique properties made ClTx an ideal candidate for clinical trials in glioma.",

The radiolabeled TM-601 presented increased life-time in tumor area, when compared to normal brain, specificity to surgical cavity, no grade 3 or 4 toxicities, and it was well tolerated. Besides, some of these patients didn't show any progression of the tumor for 30 months (Mamelak et al., 2006). Consequently, a phase II study was initiated in the United States enrolling patients from 17 centers presenting recurrent glioma. The results showed survival improvement and were made known during the annual meeting of the Neuro-Oncology Society in 2009 (Shen et al., 2009), and widely noticed by medical newspapers. Phase I/II clinical trials with 131I-TM-601 also showed it is an important imaging tool for determining the extent of neoplastic growth (Hockaday et al., 2005). A bioconjugate consisting of ClTx and the fluorescent compound Cy5.5 has been successfully used to demarcate cancer cells from the surrounding normal cells in patients, increasing the chance to remove cancer cells without damaging healthy cells (Stroud et al., 2011).",

It showed 68% identity to chlorotoxin isolated from L. quinquestriatus (Wu et al., 2000, Yang et al., 2005). The recombinant BmKCT (rBmKCT) reversibly inhibited chloride currents of single glioma cells (U2251) (Yang et al., 2005), as well as of human glioma (SHG-44) cells, which also had the proliferation inhibited by the toxin while normal astrocytes were not affected (Fu et al., 2007). rBmKCT was intraperitonealy administered to normal mice and histological analysis showed damage in brain, leg muscle and cardiac muscle (Fu et al., 2007). 131I-BmKCT specifically conjugated with C6 glioma cells and inhibited the cell growth in vitro (Zhao et al., 2010). The recombinant GST-BmKCT inhibited the growth and the metastasis of C6 glioma cells in vivo in rats, and the l3lI-labeled or Cy5.5-conjugated rGST-BmKCT targeted specifically to glioma in situ (Fan et al., 2010). The combination therapy of BmKCT and LiCl synergistically inhibited migration, invasion and proliferation of C6 glioma cells, accompanied by diminished activity of metalloproteinase-2 (Fu et al., 2007). More recently, a delivery system based on a recombinant replication-defective adenovirus (Ad) was constructed to serve as the vehicle to transport the BmKCT gene to the C6 glioma cells (Du et al., 2013). These authors showed that Ad-BmKCT significantly inhibited the tumor proliferation in mice in a time-dependent manner.",

BmK AGAP analgesic activity was verified on hot-plate and mouse twisting assays (Liu et al., 2003). The antitumor activity was shown in vivo in S-180 fibrosarcoma and Ehrlich ascites tumor models, where BmK AGAP increased the survival period and decreased the tumor size at 1 mg/kg mouse body weight (Liu et al., 2003). The recombinant rBmK AGAP (rAGAP) inhibited the proliferation of glioma cells leading to cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and suppression of proteins related to cell cycle regulation and cell growth (Zhao et al., 2011). Recently, a new peptide holding 94% identity to BmK AGAP was isolated from the venom of the same scorpion species, and also presented the dual-function with analgesic and antitumor activities. It was named BmK AGAP-SYPU2 (Shao et al., 2014).",

As Imperatoxin A (IpTxa), from P. imperator, the first scorpion toxin with capacity to bind to RyR with high affinity and specificity (Valdivia et al., 1992), they share structural identity to a segment of the II\u2013III loop of the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor hat has been proposed to act as an activator of the RyR1 (Fajloun et al., 2000). There are 4 known scorpion calcins with the capacity to act on RyR, and together with many other peptides able to translocate across the plasma membrane within seconds to minutes, are termed cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) (Howl et al., 2007). For instance, maurocalcine was efficiently used as an intracellular delivery agent for doxorubicin (Dox) in low- and high-invasive breast carcinoma MCF7 and MDA-MB 231 cells (which are Dox-resistant and Dox-sensitive cell lines, respectively) in vitro. On the Dox-resistant cell line, the coupling of Dox to maurocalcine allowed to overcome the drug resistance (Aroui et al., 2009). Many MCa analogs with low toxicity or shorter length were designed and their ability to drive different compounds to the intracellular space was proved (Conde et al., 2000, Tisseyre et al., 2013; reviewed in Poillot and De Waard (2011)). Among the possible applications, are the diagnostic tools based on coupling MCa to dyes and nanoparticles (Jayagopal et al., 2009), and the theragnostic applications, by means of coupling MCa to radioactive material (Tisseyre et al., 2014).",
