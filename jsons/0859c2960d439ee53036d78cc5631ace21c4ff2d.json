Special stains are of limited value in identifying the gram-negative bacillus responsible for Legionnaires' disease and have been largely supplanted by a combination of cultures and serology. Nocardiosis ( Fig. 4 .5) occurs almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients and is caused by a gram-positive filamentous organism (Nocardia spp.) common in soil and as normal oral microflora. Nocardia pneumonia may follow a fulminant course, and about half of patients develop disseminated infections, which frequently involve the central nervous system. Actinomycosis (Fig. 4.6) is also caused by gram-positive, anaerobic, filamentous bacteria (Actinomyces spp.) common in the oral cavity and oropharynx. Actinomycosis often occurs in patients with poor oral and dental hygiene. Lung involvement frequently includes fistulous involvement of pleural and chest wall soft tissues. Microscopically, the histologic findings are similar to those described in nocardiosis, but the organisms have a propensity to form larger macroscopic colonies in vivo that are identifiable in routinely stained sections as sulfur granules; these are indistinguishable from those seen more commonly in tonsils.",

Pneumocystis pneumonia is affiliated with highly variable histologic features and therefore should always be in the differential diagnosis of infections in immunocompromised patients. In its most classic form, the organisms cluster within a fibrinous air-space exudate, producing a characteristic frothy or bubbly appearance on routinely stained sections. Other relatively common variants include granulomatous inflammation and diffuse alveolar damage. Pneumocystis pneumonia with coexisting HSV infection. As illustrated in this high-magnification photomicrograph, more than one organism may be present in a lung biopsy from an immunocompromised patient.
