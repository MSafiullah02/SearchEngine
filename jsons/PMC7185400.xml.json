These children represented 93% of all admissions for wheezing during the enrollment period. Children with chronic lung disease or congenital heart disease and children who were immunosuppressed were excluded. The control group included 133 children with no symptoms of wheezing at the time of admission. Exclusion criteria for the controls included immunosuppression but did not include the presence of other respiratory tract symptoms or a history of previous wheezing, asthma, or allergic disorders. Goals for matching among wheezing and control patients included age and sex. The majority of matched controls were enrolled within a month of each wheezing patient. Patient demographic information was obtained from hospital charts and from questionnaires administered to parents. The study was approved by the Human Investigation Committee at the University of Virginia. Informed consent was obtained from parents, and assent was obtained from children when they were old enough (usually \u22657 years old).",

For children age \u22654 years, a Yankauer, Medi-Vac, suction catheter (Allegiance Healthcare Corp) was used. After obtaining the sample, 3 mL PBS was aspirated through the catheter to rinse residual secretions into the trap. A plastic transfer pipette was used to mix secretions vigorously with wash fluid. One milliliter of this mixture was added to viral transport medium (ViraTrans; Trinity Biotec Co, Wicklow, Ireland). Each sample was transported on ice to the Clinical Virology Laboratory at the University of Virginia for virus culture.",

Conserved RNA sequences for influenza A and B, RSV strains A and B, and parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3 were detected by using the Hexaplex RT-PCR Enzyme Hybridization Assay (Prodesse, Waukesha, Wis). To test for adenovirus, DNA was extracted from wash samples and amplified by PCR by using primers corresponding to the hexon-coding region.16., 17. This region has a high degree of homogology among adenovirus serotypes. Each nasal wash was also tested for RSV and influenza A and B antigens by using membrane enzyme immunoassays (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, Ill).",

Tests of homogeneity with respect to the frequency data were formulated as a difference of 2 group proportions in which the group proportions were assumed equal under the null hypothesis. Nonparametric exact methods were used to have a test and CI with proper coverage probability, even when the contingency cell frequencies were small.18 Exact 2-sided 95% CIs for the differences of proportion were constructed as described by Agresti and Min.19 Multivariate analyses related to predicting wheezing as a function of the patients' atopic status and evidence for viral infection were performed by multiple logistic regression. Tests of association were evaluated on the basis of the generalized Wald \u03c72 statistic,20 and 95% CI construction for the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was based on the Wald approximation.21 Total serum IgE data were analyzed on the logarithmic scale by 1-way ANOVA. CI construction for the ratio of geometric means (GMs) was based on the Student t distribution. StatXact 5 (Cytel, Cambridge, Mass) was used to compute nonparametric exact tests and the nonparametric exact 95% CIs. The Proc Genmod and the Proc Mixed procedures of SAS version 8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) were used to conduct the multiple logistic regression and the ANOVA, respectively.",

However, controversies persist regarding the relationship between viral infections and the atopic characteristics of the children who have these attacks. In our current study, viral infections were frequently detected among wheezing patients, and their prevalence declined with age. From age 3 years on, children admitted for wheezing had striking atopic characteristics, and 40% had no evidence of virus infection, despite the comprehensive assessment for viral pathogens that included PCR tests, cultures, and antigen detection for RSV and influenza. Moreover, the wheezing children >3 years old with positive tests for virus had atopic characteristics similar to those of children who had negative tests, and both groups had similar monthly admission patterns, including an increased risk for hospitalization during the fall. Taken together, the data suggest that atopy among the children age 3 to 18 years may be critical as a risk factor for hospital admission and an adverse response to infection, especially infections caused by rhinovirus.",

At other times of the year, high rates of virus were detected, but rhinovirus was the most common pathogen.

            "text": "Collectively, these observations suggest that sensitization and exposure to aeroallergens may be a predisposing risk factor for an augmented response to acute infections with rhinovirus. In keeping with this, young adults with mild asthma and elevated levels of total serum IgE developed increased lower respiratory tract symptoms along with evidence for increased airway inflammation in response to an experimental rhinovirus challenge.40 In addition, the asthmatics with higher IgE levels had evidence for increased airway inflammation and reduced lung function before viral inoculation. Moreover, in our pediatric emergency department, the strongest odds for wheezing were observed among asthmatic children who were atopic and who tested positive for virus.14., 41. This observation was even more striking in the current study among wheezing children who were 3 to 18 years old, and it provides further evidence that the interaction between allergen-induced and virus-induced inflammation may be amplified and synergistic rather than additive.",

This has also been observed annually in our pediatric emergency department.42 Rhinovirus infections, acquired when children return to school, have been thought to contribute to this peak. However, we did not detect a higher prevalence of rhinovirus during the fall months in this study. Moreover, the monthly pattern of admissions, especially peak admissions in the fall, was very similar among wheezing children who tested positive or negative for virus. During the fall, exposure to ragweed allergen and Alternaria increases, and significant elevations in dust mite allergen have been detected in homes of asthmatic subjects living in central Virginia.43 In the current study, sensitization to dust mite was significantly associated with wheezing even after adjusting for sensitization to other aeroallergens. In conclusion, the children hospitalized for wheezing from the age of 3 years on had striking atopic characteristics, including levels of total serum IgE that could potentially be treated with anti-IgE antibody. Combined with observations from previous studies,40 the results also suggest that efforts to reduce allergic airway inflammation might help children and young adults with asthma tolerate their infections with rhinovirus better.",
