Nowadays, classification of RVAs is performed almost exclusively by sequencing analyses of the gene segments encoding the VP7 and VP4 outer capsid proteins, and 27 G- and 37 P-genotypes have been recognized, respectively (Matthijnssens et al., 2011, Trojnar et al., 2013). To date, only genotypes G3P[12] and G14P[12] are considered to be of epidemiological importance in horses (Papp et al., 2013). Equine G3 RVA strains have been further subdivided into subtypes G3A and G3B based on their reactivity with mAbs (Browning et al., 1992). Interestingly, the subtype G3B seems to be restricted to Japan, whereas G3A seems to be prevalent in the rest of the world (Bailey et al., 2013).",

They cause significant economic losses because infected foals need to be quarantined from other foals and pregnant mares to avoid the further spread of the virus, which is a labor-intensive and costly event for horse-breeders (Ntafis et al., 2010, Papp et al., 2013). Besides good farm management, vaccination is currently the most widely used method to reduce the risk of disease caused by RVA in horse farms (Sellon and Long, 2014). Currently 3 inactivated vaccines are licensed globally and administered to pregnant mares. Vaccines based on the inactivated H-2 strain (G3AP[12]) are licensed in the US, New Zealand, Australia and several European countries (Zoetis Inc.). The vaccine licensed in Japan uses the HO-5 strain (G3BP[12]) (Nisseiken Co., Ltd). The third vaccine is licensed in Argentina and contains the equine RVA strain H-2, a simian G3P[2] RVA strain and the bovine G6P[1] RVA strain (Biog\u00e9nesis Bag\u00f3).",

Based on the manufacturer declaration, the test is able to detect all subtypes by detecting the conserved NSP5 gene on genome segment 11, encoding a non-structural protein of RVAs.

In the VP4 phylogenetic tree the same strains cluster together, as in the VP7 tree. The P[12] sequences of the G14 carrying strains are nearly identical (99.4-100%), and cluster with P[12] strains from South Africa and Ireland. These P[12] sequences are located in a different cluster as compared to the G3 carrying P[12] strains (nucleotide identities ranging from 94.8\u201395.9%). The former P[12] strains are closely related with equine P[12] RVA strains from Ireland and Greece, and show a genetic diversity as low as 98.6% (Fig. 2B). The P[18] VP4 sequence obtained from sample EQ44 was shown to cluster with reference strain L338 and showed a 96.0% nucleotide similarity.",

            "text": "Vaccination of infants or pregnant mothers has been shown one of the most effective measurements to prevent RVA gastroenteritis in humans as well as in a variety of animal species (Dhama et al., 2009). For the prevention of gastroenteritis caused by RVA in horses, the approach of using inactivated RVA vaccines to administer to pregnant mares has been selected. A number of studies have been conducted assessing the vaccine efficacy of equine RVA vaccines. It was shown in several field studies that following vaccination of mares, antibodies can be detected in blood, colostrum and their foals without adverse effects (Barrandeguy et al., 1998, Imagawa et al., 2005, Powell et al., 1997). Follow-up of clinical parameters associated with RVA infections in these studies demonstrated variable vaccine efficacy, which suggests that vaccination provides reasonable but not complete protection. However, the interpretation of field data is in general difficult. As the overall amount of RVA is reduced in the stable or herd when horses are vaccinated, this reduced infection pressure benefits also unvaccinated horses in the study which makes the assessment of vaccine efficacy difficult. Although little is known about cross protection between G3 and G14 serotypes, a recent study in Japan suggests that a vaccine based on a G3BP[12] RVA strain also generated cross protective virus-neutralizing antibodies against G14P[12] RVA strains, albeit at a slightly lower level (Nemoto et al., 2012). This confirms previous studies, which demonstrated that G3 and G14 serotypes partly cross-react with each other (Imagawa et al., 2005, Imagawa et al., 2002). This cross-reaction in combination with the fact that G3 and G14 are also genetically related G types suggests that a vaccine based on one of these serotypes should offer a certain degree of (cross-)protection against both serotypes. A previous study demonstrated that diarrhea caused by a serotype G14 rotavirus infection was comparatively milder in the group of horses vaccinated with an inactivated G3 serotype RVA vaccine as compared to the non-vaccinated group (Imagawa et al., 2005). This raises questions about the benefit of using a G3/G14 multivalent vaccine as suggested by some researchers (Bailey et al., 2013). Nonetheless, there are a few observational studies, which have suggested that vaccination may have caused a shift in the genotype distribution of circulating equine RVA strains in Ireland (Collins et al., 2008) and Argentina (Garaicoechea et al., 2011). Our investigation was an additional attempt to increase the knowledge on the epidemiological situation of equine RVAs in Europe and predict the usefulness of currently available commercial vaccines.",

Our data also suggest that regional differences in the genotype distribution exist, as can be seen in the data from Belgium and Germany, where G3 and G14, respectively, were most prevalent, although this was based on rather small numbers. In this context, an interesting observation was the finding of the P[18] genotype in the Belgian RVA strain EQ44, in a mixed infection with G14 and P[12]. L338 is thus far the only P[18] RVA strain detected worldwide, isolated from a foal with diarrhea in the UK in 1991 (Browning et al., 1991a). Complete genome analyses of this strain revealed that the 11 gene segments were unique, each belonging to their own genotype (Matthijnssens et al., 2012). The single isolation of this particular RVA strain has always raised questions, whether or not L338 was a genuine equine RVA, or may have been the result of an interspecies transmission from a yet unidentified host species. The detection of a novel P[18] RVA strain in this study, 22 years after the detection of L338, lends support to the former hypothesis of a genuine equine RVA strain. This hypothesis is further supported by the fact that the obtained P[18] sequence showed 4.0% differences on the nucleotide level compared to L338, suggesting an accumulation of mutations has occurred over 2 decades. However, it cannot be excluded that this evolution has occurred in a different host species, and that this virus was transmitted to horses on two different occasions. L338 was detected in combination with G13, whereas we could not detect G13 in the sample. This might be explained by (a) the P[18] from EQ44 was combined with G14, (b) P[18] was combined with a genotype that was not detected by our VP7 primers or (c) G13 has accumulated mutations in the G13 primer binding sites, and was therefore not detected. Intensified RVA surveillance programs in horses are needed to address these questions.",
