As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, universal masking is emerging as one of the key NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions) for containing or slowing the spread of the pandemic. Combined with other NPIs including social distancing and mass contact tracing, a \"mouth-and-nose lockdown\" is far more sustainable than a \"full body lockdown\", from economic, social, and mental health standpoints. To provide both policy makers and the public with a more concrete feel for how masks impact the dynamics of virus spread, we are making an interactive visualization of the ABM simulation available online at http://dek.ai/masks4all. We recommend immediate mask wearing recommendations, official guidelines for correct use, and awareness campaigns to shift masking mindsets away from pure selfprotection, towards aspirational goals of responsibly protecting one's community.",

Furthermore, such approach allows setting different model parameters for each individual, which we use to model masking. In a network model, a graph of society is built with nodes representing individuals and edgestheir interactions. Each node has a state S, E, I, R, or F (the latter added to represent dead individuals). Adjacent nodes form close contact networks of an individual, while contacts made with an individual from anywhere in the network represent global contacts in the population. Varying the parameters affecting the two levels of interaction, as well as setting network properties such as the mean number of adjacent nodes (\"close contacts\") allows us to model the degree of social distancing and lockdown measures.",

            "text": "In the second of our two new theoretical models, we employed stochastic individual agent based modelling (ABM) as an alternative Monte Carlo simulation technique for understanding the impact of universal masking. Agent based models have roots in various disciplines. A stochastic agent program can be defined as a agent function f : p \u2192 Pr(a) which maps possible percept vectors to a probabilistic distribution over possible actions (or to states that influence subsequent actions). In AI, Russell and Norvig (2009) summarise five classes of intelligent agents: simple reflex agents, model-based reflex agents, goal-based agents, utility-based agents, and learning agents; note, however, that agents may also be sus-ceptible to imperceptible environmental factors such as viruses. Holland and Miller (1991) discuss artificial adaptive agents for modeling complex systems in economics. Bonabeau (2002) surveys agent based models for simulating human systems. As in other disciplines, ABM approaches in epidemiology (see, e.g., Hunter et al. (2017) . Tracy et al. (2018 ), or Hunter et al. (2018 ) have several advantages compared to compartmental models which group undifferentiated individuals into large aggregates (like in the above SEIR simulation). First, because the behavior and characteristics of each agent is independent, they can simulate complex dynamic systems with less oversimplification of rich variation among individuals. Second, because agents can be simulated in physical two-or three-dimensional spaces, they can better simulate the geometry of contact between individuals, which is highly relevant in epidemiology. Third, the randomization on each run makes the statistical variance more apparent than in the SIR family of models, whose smooth curves often misleadingly convey more certainty than warranted. Fourth, ABMs lend themselves well to visualization, as seen in Figure 5 , which helps convey the non-linear behavior of complex dynamic systemsan especially relevant advantage when the exponential effect of masking can be counterintuitive in many cultures due to pre-existing cultural biases (Leung, 2020) and unconscious cognitive biases (De Kai, 2020).",

In such classic situations, for instance in hospitals and elderly homes, only medical masks combined with other protective equipment provide protection. Comparing different mask materials, medical masks have been found to be up to three times more effective in blocking transmission compared to homemade masks (Davies et al., 2013) . Surgical masks most efficaciously reduce the emission of influenza virus particles into the environment in respiratory droplets.

The rest of the above-listed east Asian countries has followed the same course in the second half of the XXth century, including China as it was confronting a severe particle pollution crisis in the first part of the 2010s (Kuo (2014) , Li (2014) , Hansstein and Echegaray (2018)).

As an example of the latter, in Hong Kong, masking was practiced by 79% of the general population during the 2003 SARS outbreak, but by only a maximum of 10% of the general population during the Influenza A pandemic in 2009 .",

For example, Singapore initially encouraged people to wear masks only when feeling unwell. Then, on April, 5, the government changed policy and decided to distribute reusable face masks to all households (Cheong, 2020) . On the other end, Hong Kong decided by January 24, 2020 to advise the general population to wear surgical masks in crowded places and public transports (Hong Kong Department of Health, 2020). As can be observed from Figure 6 , as of April 10, 2020, the characteristics for epidemic control in terms of daily growth and peak from reduction are better for Hong Kong than for Singapore. These variations may be related to levels of adherence to masking by the general population. Though there are no available data as of April 10, 2020 as per adherence to universal masking in Singapore, telephone surveys in Hong Kong done in February 11-14, 2020 and then in March 10-13, 2020, both after Department of Health public advice, have shown declared masking adherence at the very high levels of 97.5% and 98.8% respectively when going out .
