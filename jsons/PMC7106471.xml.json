Although some of the remaining DNA plays a crucial role in the maintenance of DNA structure and regulation of mRNA expression (i.e., transcription binding sites, promoter and enhancer regions), subsequent studies have shown that a significant proportion is transcribed into \u2018non-coding RNAs\u2019 (ncRNAs). Indeed, the recent release of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (the \u2018ENCODE\u2019 project aims to catalogue all the functional elements in human DNA) has concluded that \u223c80% of DNA is functional and, importantly, that the majority (\u223c62%) is transcribed into non-coding RNA (ncRNA) 1, 2. However, the broad definition employed to identify functional/transcribed regions of DNA, which included an association with modified histones, methylated CpG dinucleotides or open chromatin, means this is likely to be an overestimate 3, 4. Indeed, examination of evolutionary conservation gives a more conservative estimate of \u223c10% functional DNA, although this still allows for large regions that might be transcribed into ncRNA 3, 4.",

            "text": "ncRNAs are broadly classified as either short ncRNAs (<200 nucleotides) or long ncRNAs (>200 nucleotides). The microRNA (miRNA) family of short ncRNAs are best characterised and are known to induce mRNA degradation or block mRNA translation via the RNA interference pathway. By contrast, much less in known about lncRNAs although, in comparison with mRNAs, these are generally shorter in length, contain fewer albeit longer exons, and are expressed at lower levels (median is \u223c10% of mRNAs) 1, 5, 6. lncRNAs also demonstrate low evolutionary sequence conservation, with estimates that only \u223c15% of mouse protein-coding genes have homologues in humans, leading to speculation that the majority of lncRNAs are non-functional 6, 7, 8, 9. The most recent release from GenCode (version 19) has annotated \u223c14 000 lncRNA genes in humans [5] although, given that many lncRNAs are expressed in a cell-, tissue-, and developmental stage-specific manner, this is likely to be a significant underestimate 1, 10. Presently, lncRNAs are classified by their position relative to protein-coding mRNAs and comprise the long intergenic ncRNA (lincRNA), intronic lncRNA, antisense lncRNA, transcribed pseudogene lncRNAs, and enhancer RNA (eRNA) (Box 1\n). However, these arbitrary definitions will need refining in the light of the increasing volume of sequencing data and the accumulating information on lncRNA function and mechanism.Box 1Classification of lncRNAsWith limited information on their function and mechanism of action, lncRNAs are currently classified by their positions relative to protein-coding genes (Figure I\n). In general, most lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and are therefore capped, polyadenylated and commonly spliced. Antisense lncRNAs are transcribed across the exons of protein-coding genes from the opposite strand [76] whereas intronic lncRNAs are transcribed from intronic regions in either the sense or antisense orientation. The largest group are the intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs), that are located between protein-coding genes 32, 77. Two additional groups that could arguably be classified as lincRNAs are transcribed pseudogenes and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Transcribed pseudogenes arise when a gene loses the ability to produce a protein, either through mutation or inaccurate duplication [78]. eRNAs are produced by either mono- and bidirectional transcription at intergenic enhancer regions and can be differentiated from other lincRNAs by the presence of high H3K4me1 marks in their promoter regions 61, 79, 80. This contrasts with the members of the antisense, intronic, intergenic, and pseudogene lncRNA families that are associated with epigenetic marks characteristic of protein-coding genes (i.e., high H3Kme3 in the promoter region).",

As described in the forthcoming sections, immune-related lncRNAs are generally identified through examination of differential expression in response to activation of immune cells. This provides the basis for the subsequent functional and mechanistic analysis of individual lncRNAs. For clarity, these individual lncRNAs will be reviewed under the headings of innate immunity, acquired immunity, host\u2013pathogen interaction, and enhancer RNAs.

These are commonly transcribed in the antisense direction (relative to the protein-coding gene) which, in the case of upstream lncRNAs, can produce bidirectional transcription of the lncRNA and mRNA from a shared promoter region. Confusingly, these are often termed antisense lncRNAs despite there being only partial or no overlap with protein-coding genes and, as a result, we have recently proposed that these should instead be classified as mRNA-flanking lncRNAs (mf-lncRNAs) [13]. Given their locations, this group of lncRNAs which include THRIL (TNF\u03b1 and hnRNPL related immunoregulatory lincRNA) [15], PACER (p50-associated COX-2 extragenic RNA) [16], lincR-Ccr2-5\u2032AS\n[14], lnc-IL7R\n[17], and IL1\u03b2-RBT46\n[13], have been shown to regulate the expression of their adjacent protein-coding gene in cis. eRNAs have also been demonstrated to control expression of protein-coding genes in cis, although chromatin looping is thought to be responsible for bringing the distal enhancer regions into close proximity with the promoter regions. The majority of the remaining immune-related lncRNAs, which are located in intergenic regions, regulate the immune response in trans. In addition to their cis actions, the four mRNA-flanking lncRNAs THRIL\n[15], lincR-Ccr2-5\u2032AS\n[14], lnc-IL7R\n[17], and IL1\u03b2-RBT46\n[13] have also been shown regulate the expression of multiple additional genes in trans.",

Presently, it would appear that the action of most immune-related lncRNAs is mediated through protein binding. Targets include splicing factor proline/glutamine rich (SFPQ) [23], importin-\u03b2 family [24], and the transcription factors, nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) 16, 25, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) [26], and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) [27]. In these known examples, lncRNAs have been shown to act as \u2018decoys\u2019 to prevent protein\u2013DNA binding (SFQR, NF-\u03baB, and GR) or as antagonists of protein\u2013protein interactions (importin-\u03b2 and STAT3). Immune-related lncRNAs have also been shown to interact with members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family 15, 28 and components of chromatin-modifying complexes including the polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2) [29], WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5), a core subunit of the MLL methyltransferase complex [30], and the UTX/JMJD3 demethylases [31]. Although the exact mechanism is undefined, it has been speculated that they might act as scaffolds to bring together proteins and/or target these to the DNA through base-pairing, a situation that has been described with other chromatin-associated lncRNAs [12].",

Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed these groups were enriched for genes involved in the immune response and included Ccl5 and Il6. Although the precise mechanism is unknown, the repressive action of lincRNA-Cox2 was mediated through interaction with hnRNP-A/B and hnRNP-A2/B1 [28]. These hnRNPs are members of a family of multifunctional RNA-binding proteins that are known to have a role in the processing of precursor mRNA, as well as in regulating gene expression [36]. Of relevance, Sauvageau et al.\n[37] have recently reported the production of a lincRNA-Cox2 knockout mouse which will provide an invaluable resource for the in vivo studies. Limited preliminary analyses have shown that lincRNA-Cox2 is selectively expressed in the lung, and that knockout does not impact upon the development of these animals [37].",

However, in addition to NEAT1, SFPQ is also known to repress the transcription of CXCL8 through binding within its promoter region. Following reports that NEAT1 expression is increased after viral infection of mouse neural cells [40], Imamura et al.\n[23] examined the role of NEAT1 in the antiviral response within HeLa and A549 epithelial cells. Activation of TLR3 using poly(IC), or infection with influenza virus or herpes simplex virus, was shown to stimulate NEAT1 expression, resulting in NEAT1-dependent increases in paraspeckle formation [23]. Significantly, increased CXCL8 expression also occurred as a result of the translocation of SFPQ from the CXCL8 promoter sites to the paraspeckles (Figure 1D). Of relevance, knockdown and overexpression identified 85 additional genes that were regulated by NEAT1, including several that are involved in the antiviral response [23].",

Lnc-DC knockdown impacted upon the expression of 664 protein-coding genes, resulting in impaired antigen uptake, reduced allogenic CD4+ T cell production and attenuated cytokine release. Interestingly, lnc-DC is located within the cytoplasm and its action is mediated through activation of STAT3, a transcription factor that is important for dendritic cell differentiation. Detailed analysis showed an interaction between the 3\u2032-end of lnc-DC (residues 265\u2013417) and the C-terminus of STAT3 (residues 583\u2013770). This prevented de-phosphorylation of the Tyr705 (Y705) by Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) and maintained STAT3 in its active phosphorylated form (Figure 1E).",

This action was mediated through an interaction between PACER and the inhibitory p50 homodimer (of NF-\u03baB). PACER decreased p50\u2013p50 occupancy at the Cox2 promoter and permitted the binding of the active p50\u2013p65 form of NF-\u03baB and assembly of the RNA polymerase II pre-initiation complex [16] (Figure 1F). This event was associated with the recruitment of p300 histone acetyltransferase and increases in histone acetylation. Of relevance, these researchers demonstrate that baseline PACER expression and access to the Cox2 promoter were established and maintained by the chromatin boundary/insulator factor CTCF, which opened the chromatin structure in this region [16].",

Mechanistic studies showed that interaction between NRON and karyopherin importin-\u03b21 (KPNB1) blocked the nucleocytoplasmic transport and therefore the transcriptional activity of NFAT [24] (Figure 2A). Subsequent studies in resting cells indicated that the heavily phosphorylated NFAT is located within a large cytoplasmic RNA\u2013protein complex that contains NRON, a scaffold protein [IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein (IQGAP)], and three NFAT kinases [casein kinase 1 (CK), glycogen synthase 3 (GSK), and dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase (DYRK)] [45]. Knockdown studies showed a functional synergy between NRON and IQGAP1 in blocking NFAT de-phosphorylation, a process that is required for nuclear translocation/activation and induction of IL-2 [45] (Figure 2A). NRON is therefore a constitutively expressed, intronic lncRNA that forms a complex with other proteins to bind the inactive NFAT and localise this transcription factor in the cytoplasm.",

NeST, which was formally known as Tmevpg1, is expressed in TH1 CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer cells [46]. Earlier work showed that expression of NeST was increased in TH1 but not TH2 polarised cells, correlated with Ifng expression, and was dependent upon the TH1-specific transcription factors STAT4 and T-bet [47]. By using mouse strains overexpressing NeST, Gomez et al.\n[30] showed increased clearance of Salmonella infection but reduced resistance to Theiler's virus, a mouse picornavirus. Mechanistic analysis indicated that nucleus-located NeST induced the expression of Ifng in trans in activated CD8+ T cells through an interaction with WDR5, a core subunit of the MLL H3K4 methyltransferase complex, leading to histone methylation at the Ifng locus [30] (Figure 2B).

There was also downregulation of 656 genes associated with the cell cycle and nuclear division [14]. Its mechanism of action is currently unknown, although knockdown had no effect upon H3K4me3 levels, DNase hypersensitivity, and RNA polymerase II binding, thus indicating that lincR-Ccr2-5\u2032AS does not function by modifying epigenetic marks and chromatin accessibility (Figure 2C). Given that lincR-Ccr2-5\u2032AS expression was highly correlated with seven of the 23 genes implicated in chemokine-mediated signaling pathways, including six that were located in the same genomic region, these investigators proceeded to examine its role in cell migration.

By comparison, little is known about B cell function, although Bolland et al.\n[48] have described a role for lncRNAs in the chromatin remodelling associated with the variable, diversity, and joining (V(D)J) recombination required to produce antigen receptors (Ig or TCR).

An example of the former is NEAT1, which controls HIV-1 replication by regulating the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic export of Rev-dependent instability element (INS) containing HIV mRNA [50]. Another well-characterised example is polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) RNA produced by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) that is able to modulate viral gene expression as well as subvert the host immune response. Thus, induction of PAN RNA is important in the switch from latent to lytic infection 51, 52, a process mediated by an interaction between PAN and the demethylases UTX and JMJD3 to remove the suppressive H3K23me3 mark within the KSHV viral genome (Figure 3A)\n[31]. Of note, PAN also physically interacts with LANA (latency associated nuclear antigen), a protein that maintains latency by binding to the KSHV genome, and has a role in regulating the dissociation of the LANA protein upon viral activation [53]. In addition to regulating the viral life cycle, PAN RNA also suppressed the expression of host genes involved in the inflammatory and antiviral response [52], a process mediated through activation of the polycomb repression complex 2 (PRC2) (Figure 3A) [29]. Overall, these studies imply that the viral non-coding PAN RNA is a regulator of both viral and host gene expression.",

            "text": "Enhancer regions regulate the expression of protein-coding genes, often over large distances and in an orientation-independent manner. These regions are characterised by increased sensitivity to nuclease, p300/CBP acetyltransferase, and RNA polymerase II (RNAP) binding, as well as by deposition of chromatin marks including histone H3K4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) and H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) [54]. Recent studies have also demonstrated that these sites are associated with active transcription to produce enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) \u223c0.5\u20135 kb in length 1, 22, 55, 56. Of relevance, the recent release of the FANTOM 5 consortium has identified >43 000 eRNAs across 808 cells/tissues [57]. However, until recently it was unclear whether eRNAs represented transcriptional noise or were instrumental in mediating the action of the enhancer regions. To address this question, Lam et al.\n[58] investigated the role of eRNA transcription during Rev-Erb-\u03b1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1; Nr1d1) and Rev-Erb-\u03b2 (nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 2; Nr1d2)-mediated gene repression in mouse macrophages, a process occurring through the recruitment of the nuclear receptor corepressor (NcoR)-HDAC3 to promoter and enhancer sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of Rev-Erb-\u03b1 and \u03b2 and subsequent sequencing showed that the majority (90%) of binding sites were located >1 kb from transcription start sites and within putative enhancer regions. Subsequent global run-on sequencing revealed that 76% of these enhancers were transcribed. To provide direct evidence that transcription of these eRNAs was linked to mRNA expression, these investigators focused on two eRNAs and their nearest neighbouring genes; Cx3cr1 and Mmp9. Knockdown of these eRNAs reduced expression of Cx3cr1 and Mmp9 but not that of other local genes (Figure 3B). Furthermore, cloning of the enhancer region revealed that although the core regions containing the transcription factor binding sites were able to enhance gene expression in cis, the magnitude of cis regulation was notably increased when the eRNA region was also cloned. Similarly, we recently described widespread expression of eRNAs following exposure of human monocytes to LPS and that LPS-induced expression of IL1B is dependent on a downstream eRNA that also appeared to regulate CXCL8 expression [13].",

This was demonstrated in a series of elegant experiments by Kaikkonen et al.\n[59] that examined the sequential changes that occurred during the remodelling of the enhancer landscape following activation of mouse bone BMDM. Specifically, Kaikkonen et al.\n[59] examined the changes associated with the selection and activation of \u223c3000 new enhancer regions following exposure to the TLR4 agonist, Kdo2-lipid A (KLA). This showed an initial interaction at the enhancer site between the TLR4-induced p65 component of NF-\u03baB and the macrophage-specific transcription factors, PU.1 and C/EBP. However, the subsequent establishment of the enhancer region, through the acetylation of histone H4K5/8, was coupled to eRNA transcription. Thus transcription of eRNAs appears to play a role both in the establishment of enhancer regions [59] and in enhancer-mediated gene expression in cis\n[58]. This conclusion is supported by studies in other cell types 60, 61, 62, 63, as well as by the FANTOM 5 data which showed that eRNA expression was predominantly bidirectional and strongly correlated with enhancer activity [57].",

            "text": "In concluding, we need to return to the question of whether lncRNAs are novel regulators of the immune response? As a starting point, investigators often address this question by using RNA sequencing to detect the differential expression of known and novel lncRNAs. However, as with all profiling studies, one of the great challenges is the identification of functionally relevant lncRNAs from the large lists that are commonly produced. This problem is compounded by the fact that lncRNAs generally demonstrate poor evolutionary sequence conservation, thereby preventing the use of this traditional approach for the identification of functionality. Interestingly, although this indicates that most lncRNAs are likely to be non-functional, even those lncRNAs that are known to be conserved across multiple species (such as Malat1, Cyrano, and Xist) are not reported using existing alignment programmes [6]. This has led to speculation that these algorithms, which are based upon whole-genome alignments, may be an inappropriate approach for detecting conservation in rapidly evolving lncRNAs. This underlines the need for better bioinformatics tools that can be employed to identify \u2018conserved\u2019 lncRNAs and their homologues [6]. Despite these limitations, cell-based studies have identified several lncRNAs that regulate the innate immune response. Importantly, these studies have also characterised their mechanism of action and, as this number increases, it is hoped that this information can be employed to refine the bioinformatics tools required for the identification of functional sequences and/or structural motifs.",

            "text": "Figure 1: LncRNAs in the innate immune response. (A)LincRNA-COX-2 is located 3\u2032 of the COX2 gene and is expressed in response to Pam3Csk4 stimulation of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. It has widespread effects on inflammatory gene expression, repressing the transcription of anti-inflammatory genes in non-stimulated cells and promoting the expression of proinflammatory genes following Pam3Csk4 exposure via an interaction with hnRNP-A2/B1 and hnRNP-A/B [28]. (B) Using human THP1 macrophages, THRIL was identified as an antisense lncRNA (overlapping BRI3BP) that promotes TNF transcription by forming a complex with hnRNPL and binding to the promoter of TNF[15]. THRIL is expressed basally; however, this is decreased in a negative feedback loop following Pam3Csk4-induced TNF\u03b1 release [15]. THRIL has also been shown to regulate basal and Pam3Csk4-stimulated gene expression. (C)Lethe expression is induced in mouse embryonic fibroblasts following treatment with TNF\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, and dexamethasone, and prevents NF-\u03baB binding to NF-\u03baB response elements [25]. (D) In basal cells, SFPQ1 is bound to the CXCL8 promoter to repress its transcription, as well as to NEAT1 lincRNA within the paraspeckle bodies. NEAT1 expression is upregulated upon viral infection, leading to an increase in the size of NEAT1-containing paraspeckle bodies, the relocation of SFPQ1 from the CXCL8 promoter and derepression of CXCL8 transcription [23]. (E)Lnc-DC expression is required for differentiation of human monocytes into dendritic cells. Lnc-DC promotes STAT3 phosphorylation through inhibiting the action of Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) [26]. (F)PACER is located upstream of the Cox2 transcriptional start site and is expressed in the antisense direction. PACER induced COX2 expression by removing the repressive action of the p50 homodimer (of NF-\u03baB) bound at the Cox2 promoter [16].",

Upon T cell activation, several of the proteins and NRON disassociate from the complex, and increased intracellular levels of Ca2+ activate calcineurin to facilitate the dephosphorylation of NFAT, thereby allowing it translocate to the nucleus 24, 45. (B)NeST is a lincRNA located downstream of Ifng which promotes the transcription of Ifng in TH1 CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer cells in mice. NeST binds to the methyltransferase WDR5 leading to methylation of the Ifng promoter 30, 47. (C)LincR-Ccr2-5\u2032AS positively regulates the expression of genes involved in immunity and defence but negatively regulates genes involved in the cell cycle and nuclear division. Specifically, lincR-Ccr2-5\u2032AS regulates the transcription of several chemokine receptor genes (located in the same loci as the lincRNA-Ccr2-5\u2032AS gene) in mouse CD4+ TH2 cells that are required for cell migration [14].",
