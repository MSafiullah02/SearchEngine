In the group of patients with diarrhea, the median age was 56 years (\u00b118) and 32 (58%) were female. Only 2 patients symptoms which were statistically more frequents in the group with diarrhea than in the group without diarrhea were: myalgia (44 vs 36, p=0.05), sore throat (21 vs 11, p=0.027), sneezing (22 vs 10, p=0.006) and the others GI symptoms: nausea (25 vs 12, p=0.008), abdominal pain (19 vs 7, p=0.004) and vomiting (9 vs 2, p=0.028). It is important to note that patients with diarrhea were less admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (4 vs 8, p=0.027).",

Diarrhea was present in half of our patients; compared to the review of Li et al. diarrhea was clearly more often noticed in our study. A study with a prospective methodology confirmed our data. Lechien et al. described an occurrence of diarrhea in 51% of cases in 417 mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients (6) . We can argue that their population was only ambulatory cases with mild or moderate COVID-19 and possibly the occurrence of diarrhea in hospitalized patients is different. However, more than half of our patients were hospitalized, and we have the same result. Our main point is that diarrhea is probably more prevalent than 5.8% in cases of COVID-19. We have few assumptions to explain the differences between Asia studies in comparison to these results. Firstly, the theoretical possibility of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome associated with a clinical impact, but not described until now. On the other hand, the affinity of SARS-CoV-2 for the ACE2 can be specific to an ethnic group and explain a variability of clinical expression between different ethnic groups. Finally, most of the studies in the review of Li et al. had a retrospective methodology. Our study was also retrospective, and data was collected from the medical files of patients; however, we have a strong and accurate description of functional symptoms due to our national guidelines which recommended a home follow-up for patients who were not hospitalized (7) . Practically, patients who were not hospitalized or patients who were discharged were called 7 days (\u00b17 days) after the first symptoms and every week until their recoveries to follow their clinical evolution.",

Between March, 1 st and March, 17 th 2020, we reported the data about 114 patients infected with COVID-19. For each patient the diagnosis was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR on respiratory samples (2). Out of the 114 patients, 55 (48%) had diarrhea. In our study, the main symptoms (>50% of cases) were fatigue (107[94%]), cough (92[81%]), fever (> 38\u00b0C) for 90[79%] and pain syndrome (78[68%]",
