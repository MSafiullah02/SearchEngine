            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) profoundly affected the United States swine industry since its emergence in May 2013 (Huang et al., 2013; Madson et al., 2014). Outbreaks in the United States and Canada were suspected to be caused by consumption of PEDV-contaminated feed or feed ingredients (Pasick et al., 2014; Bowman et al., 2015a). Feed has since been confirmed as one of the many routes of PEDV-transmission, which has led to investigations into identifying ways to mitigate infectivity of contaminated diets or feed ingredients (Dee et al., 2014; Cochrane, 2015; Schumacher et al., 2016). Preliminary work from our previous studies suggested PEDV cross-contamination of feed may occur during feed manufacturing (Woodworth, 2015). However, infectivity of this batch-to-batch contamination was not established using bioassay. Due to the lack of additional data detailing PEDV cross-contamination during feed manufacturing, it is hypothesized that strategically sequencing batches during feed production may reduce the risk of PEDV cross-contamination. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to determine if feed batch sequencing methods could minimize PEDV cross-contamination.",

The feed was mixed for 5 min before aseptically sampled. Clean disposable gloves were worn while using a disposable plastic cup to subsample 5 equally spaced locations within the mixer. The subsampled feed formed a 400 to 500 g sample which was placed in a closeable plastic specimen bag. Feed was then discharged at a rate of approximately 4.5 kg/min into the bucket elevator (Universal Industries, Cedar Falls, IA) which had a boot pit depth of 2.54 cm from the edge of the cup to the boot bottom and contained 74 buckets (each 114 cm3). Feed carried by the buckets then exited the bucket elevator through a downspout where an additional 400 to 500 g sample was collected directly into a plastic specimen bag once the feed stream began. Mixer and bucket elevator specimen bags were set on ice in a cooler until transported the same day for rRT-PCR analysis.

A total of 66, 10-d-old pigs were purchased from a conventional breeding farm and delivered to the Iowa State University Laboratory Animal Resource facilities. All pigs were confirmed negative for PEDV, porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and porcine rotaviruses (groups A, B, and C) by virus-specific rRT-PCR on rectal swabs and were serologically negative for PEDV. Pigs were randomly divided into groups of 3 per room. Rooms had independent ventilation systems and solid flooring that was minimally rinsed to reduce PEDV aerosols. Pigs were fed liquid milk replacer (Esbilac; PetAg, Hampshire, IL) and a commercially pelleted diet (All Natural Starter 2; Heartland Co-op, Alleman, IA). The pelleted diet did not contain any animal protein with the exception of dried whey. The milk replacer and pelleted feed were not evaluated for the presence of PEDV genetic material. Previous studies using similar procedures and the same feed have resulted in no pigs which were inoculated with the negative control samples becoming positive for PEDV (Schumacher et al., 2016; Cochrane et al., 2017). Pigs had ad libitum access to feed and water at all times. After 2 d of acclimation, each pig was administered PBS feed suspension inoculum (as described above) by orogastric gavage using an 8-gauge French catheter [0 dpi (day postinoculation)]. Rectal swabs were collected daily but analyzed on -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, and 7 dpi (with remaining swabs saved if additional analysis was required) from all pigs at ISU VDL for PEDV RNA by rRT-PCR. All pigs were euthanized at 7 dpi for necropsy by i.v. overdose of pentobarbital sodium solution (Fatal-Plus; Vortech Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Dearborn, MI). An aliquot of fresh cecal contents for PEDV rRT-PCR was sent to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (Ames, IA).",

To our knowledge, this is the first experiment that demonstrates cross-contamination across batches in a feed mill by a viral pathogen as demonstrated by bioassay. Although cross-contamination occurred, feed batch sequencing did reduce the amount of detectible PEDV RNA in feed after sequencing 2 batches of swine diet following the positive batch. Thus, sequencing virally contaminated feed appears to be similar to sequencing medicated feed in effort to reduce carryover. Sequencing a batch of medicated-free feed has been shown to reduce significant drug carryover in medicated feed manufacturing (Herrman et al., 1995; Martinez-Kawas, 2008) and has been adopted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as an approved clean-out procedure for manufacturing medicated feed (FDA, 1976). Similar to medicated feed, the amount of PEDV detectible RNA in knowingly contaminated feed from our study decreased after sequencing and therefore appears to potentially mitigate cross-contamination during feed manufacturing.",

Manufacturing equipment was not cleaned nor disinfected between batches during feed mixing and conveying to mimic the feed manufacturing process in a commercial mill. Even after 2 sequences, detectible PEDV RNA persisted in feed from the bucket elevator whereas no PEDV RNA was detected in feed from the mixer. This observation could be due to cross-contamination that occurred within the boot of the bucket elevator. Buckets within the bucket elevator are designed to pick up their load from the boot\u2014which is dead space or pit area\u2014that fills with feed at the bottom foot pulley. This space is filled with previously discharged product, thus charging the boot. In commercial settings, manual clean-out of the boot is not done on a regular basis (Tilley, 2013) due to time constraints, difficult accessibility, messiness, and was seemingly unnecessary prior to this research. Therefore, the boot can create a potential source of cross-contamination as batches of feed are manufactured. Another source for persistent PEDV detection in conveyed feed could have originated from contaminated equipment surfaces following PEDV positive feed production. In a complementary study to the current experiment, we monitored the rapid widespread contamination that ensued after production of a PEDV-contaminated batch of feed and demonstrated swabs collected from the plastic bucket elevator buckets and rubber belt remained rRT-PCR positive during feed sequencing (Schumacher et al., 2017). An additional source of cross-contamination is possibly from the mixer. Although the mixer was empty and clean between discharges by commercial feed manufacturing standards, some feed (approximately 1.4 kg via preliminary data) always remained at the bottom of the mixer. Therefore, it is possible for cross-contamination of feed to occur at multiple sites during feed manufacturing.",

Undesired microorganisms are quite difficult to remove once introduced; therefore, enhanced protocols for feed mill housekeeping could be critical to prevent cross-contamination (Cochrane et al., 2016). However, housekeeping in general can be difficult for some systems for a variety of reasons such as additional labor, constant accumulation of dust and debris, and lack of downtime to perform cleaning protocols. Additionally, wet disinfection is not ideal for feed mills since mainly dry ingredients are used and because most of the equipment has limited accessibility needed for chemical cleaning (Huss et al., 2015). Instead, feed production facilities must rely on physical cleaning and good manufacturing procedures to prevent spread of microorganisms; however, these methods have been proven to increase contamination (Huss et al., 2015). Even with chemical disinfectant, PEDV genetic material has proven difficult to eliminate in the FSRC (Huss et al., 2017). In other studies, and in our own preliminary data, RNA can still be detectable by rRT-PCR following disinfection treatment (Bowman et al., 2015b). Therefore, perhaps more enhanced measures are needed for cleaning and decontamination if a feed mill becomes contaminated with PEDV.",

For example, in the mixer bioassay, only 1 pig from sequence 1 and 1 pig from sequence 2 became infected by 2 dpi in contrast to the mixer positive control where 9 of 9 pigs were infected by 2 dpi. This is likely due to the lower amount of virus in sequenced batches that can induce an infection. Similarly, in another study that used serial PEDV tissue culture dilutions to determine the minimum infectious dose, only 1 neonatal pig became infected at the lowest serial titration as compared to all pigs that became infected when challenged with higher PEDV concentrations (Thomas et al., 2015). Therefore, it seems sequencing decreased the magnitude of infectivity similarly seen with minimum infectious dose studies (Thomas et al., 2015; Schumacher et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Since the sequencing protocol did not eliminate the risk of producing infectious feed after the first sequence, this suggests that other strategies in addition to sequencing may be needed in the feed processing chain. Such strategies may include thermal or chemical mitigation to further decrease the risk of PEDV transmission (Cochrane, 2015; Cochrane et al, 2017). This may be especially true considering the stage of pig production sequenced feed is fed. For example, high health herds from nucleus farms, boar studs, or breeding stock multiplication units are critical to swine production. Porcine epidemic diarrhea infection in these herds would disrupt swine production and have devastating economic impact. Thus, sequencing alone may not provide enough hazard mitigation for these swine herds since the magnitude of the risk of infection increases when feeding larger populations (Davies et al., 2015). Further research by our group is underway investigating additional PEDV mitigation methods during feed manufacturing.",

The results of the present study suggest that a sequencing protocol can be used as a risk-reduction but not risk-elimination procedure for infectious PEDV carryover from the first sequenced batch. Manufacturing feed with a high possibility of contamination prior to manufacturing diets for at-risk animal populations (i.e., early nursery pigs or lactating sows) should be avoided to reduce exposure to infectious PEDV carryover. Concerning findings from this study revealed that sequenced rRT-PCR-negative feed was infectious. Additional research is needed to define ways to further minimize the risk of viral pathogen contamination during feed manufacturing.",
