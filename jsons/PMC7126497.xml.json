Family comprises 5 genera recognized by ICTV: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Thogotovirus and Isavirus, and 2 proposed genera \u2013 Quaranjavirus and Influenzavirus D. Influenza A viruses are most variable of all orthomyxoviruses being the cause of influenza epidemics and pandemics. Now 18 hemagglutinin (HA) and 11 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes of influenza A virus are recognized. Most of them have waterfowl as a host. Only influenza viruses of H1, H2 and H3 subtypes are known to cause pandemics and circulate in human population for considerable time. Only sporadic cases of infection on human-animal interface by influenza A(H5), A(H6), A(H7), A(H9) and A(H10) were observed.",

In so called \u201cAsian flu\u201d pandemics in 1957\u20131958, caused by influenza A(H2N2) virus around 1\u20132 million lethal cases were registered [1]. This virus emerged in humans following antigenic shift resulting from reassortment between circulating human H1N1 influenza virus and avian H2N2 influenza viruses. This reassortant 1957 pandemic viruses possessed the HA (4), NA (6), and PB1(2) gene segments of an avian H2N2 virus while the remaining five were of human H1N1 virus origin [2]. Pandemic started in Northern China in February 1957 [3] and in several weeks spread to South East Asia. In USSR first cases were registered in Central Asia (Tashkent, Dushanbe, Almaty), first wave of pandemic reached European part of USSR in the end of May 1957 [4]. Mortality rate in Leningrad in 1957\u20131959 was near 1.5% of population [5]. In 1968 influenza A(H2N2) virus was superseded by influenza A(H3N2) virus.",

Yet evidences of A(H2N2) virus infection in wild birds and poultry are regularly registered. Most of humans born after 1968 are immunologically na\u00efve to influenza A(H2N2) virus. It raises a concern that influenza A(H2N2) can be a potentially pandemic virus. Influenza pandemic preparedness measures include development of rapid diagnostic tests for potentially pandemic viruses. Real-time PCR is a state-of-the-art technology in influenza diagnostics. To date in-house conventional RT-PCR for detection of A(H2N2) viruses has been developed [12]. Conventional PCR has many disadvantages in diagnostic use due to laboriousness, high risk of contamination and long turnaround time. Several protocols for influenza subtyping using conventional PCR were published [21], [22]. Recently, Hoffmann and colleagues described RITA, realtime RT-PCR assay for wide spectrum of influenza A viruses, including H2 strains [13]. Yet, we had no opportunity for experimental comparison of RITA and our protocol for influenza A(H2) detection.",
