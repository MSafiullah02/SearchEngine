One puff into each nostril was recommended, and volunteers who developed an infection while traveling were told to use at least 3 puffs per nostril until symptoms were reduced. This study took place over an 8-wk period across Finland and the United Kingdom between November 2006 and March 2007. Volunteers were instructed to use a 5-point scale to assess their health and to record infectious episodes and symptoms in a daily diary. The activetreatment group (Nasaleze cellulose with PGE) experienced significantly fewer infections than the control group (20 vs 57; P<.001) and far fewer days on which an infection was obviously present (126 d in the active group vs 240 d in the control group; P<.05). Consequently, volunteers in the active group were less likely to pick up an airborne infection when PGE was added to this novel cellulose extract. Volunteers in the control group were much more likely to report more than 1 infectious episode over the treatment period or to endure longer periods of infection. The investigators concluded that the combination Nasaleze Travel formulation significantly reduced the number of airborne infections to which volunteers were exposed while traveling.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, airborne infections are commonplace all year round nowadays; although the chance of picking up an infection in the summer months is only 1 in 4 compared with the chance in winter, special factors may increase this risk. Long-haul jet flights appear to pose a particular risk in that at no other time are humans likely to be squeezed as tightly together with 400 potential sources of common cold infection. The chances are that any number of passengers will have the tendency to spread an airborne infection in the confined space of a jetliner, making this an ideal environment for transmission of airborne disease. Experiments on exposing uninfected volunteers to others with common cold infections have shown that the chances of catching a cold are directly related to the number of hours of exposure to infection. Hence, one is much more likely to get a cold on a long-haul flight to the United States than on a short hop to Europe. Current lifestyles often demand air conditioning, which may contribute to infection. Although the lining of the nose is covered by a thin layer of mucus that protects against infection, air conditioners unfortunately extract moisture from the air; therefore, they may cause some drying of the protective mucous blanket in the nose and predispose to infection. This feature is one that the active test compound Nasaleze Travel \u00ae (cellulose and powdered garlic extract [PGE] combination; Nasaleze Limited, Isle of Man, United Kingdom) may improve significantly, simply because of the way it works. Cold air may also help viruses establish a hold in the nose because they reproduce better in a cold environment.",

With modern jet travel, viruses are spread rapidly, which is why influenza spreads so quickly around the world during an epidemic.",

            "text": "Unfortunately, because of the extensive number of airborne infections, reinfection is common. Published literature on the activity of garlic extracts (among others) against viral infection is sparse. 1,2 It has been reported, however, that during an influenza epidemic, the former Soviet Union imported more than 500 tons of garlic cloves for acute treatment. 3 Among the viruses thought to be sensitive to garlic extracts are human cytomegalovirus, human rhinovirus type 2, herpes simplex types 1 and 2, and influenza B. Many consumers already take natural remedies such as Echinacea, vitamin C, zinc, and garlic supplements for preventive purposes and report an absence of infection with colds and symptoms associated with viral replication. 4 Cellulose powder is used as a thickener in many liquid nasal sprays and is generally regarded as safe for consumption. The unique proprietary grade of micronized cellulose used in this study (Nasaleze \u00ae ) is administered with a patented device that ensures that a suitable amount of material will be drawn from the container and delivered into the nose. Compared with liquid nasal sprays, which require preservatives, powdered cellulose inhibits bacterial and viral growth to a limited extent. Although it is not a medicine, this formulation is classified as a medical device that is safe to use throughout the year. This powdered cellulose product addresses the cause of allergic reactions, rather than the symptoms, because it works as a facial mask in preventing inhaled pollen, dirt, and allergens from reaching the lungs. In a healthy individual, the nose and the nasal tract positively extract these materials from inhaled air as it passes through on its way to serve the lungs. This filtration effect is created by very low peripheral air pressure (generated by the internal shape of the nasal tract) as the air goes through the system. This linear, low air pressure area positively attracts entrained allergens and at the same time attaches this material onto the mucous membranes (Figs 1 and 2) . 5 Mucus has the ability to rapidly adsorb and render harmless any particle that touches its surface. Spent mucus is eventually disposed of via the digestive tract. Thus, clean, allergen-free air is supplied to the lungs. A unique feature of the cellulose powder formulation described herein is that it turns into a gel on contact with the moisture that is always present in the nasal cavity. This gel is similar to normal mucus and helps to maintain delivery of a supply of clean air to the lungs.",
