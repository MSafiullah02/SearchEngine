            "text": "Biological and chemical weapons have been used throughout history.1 For millennia, indigenous South American peoples deliberately used plant-derived arrow poisons such as curare and toxins from poison dart frogs, although these preparations were used mainly for hunting. Similar toxins were used in Africa. The ancient Greeks, for whom toxikon meant \u201carrow poison,\u201d tipped arrows with winter aconite, and this practice continued into medieval Europe, persisting into the seventeenth century in Spain and Portugal.2 Soldiers in India used smoke screens, incendiary weapons, and toxic fumes as early as 2000 bce, and the Sung Dynasty in China employed a wide variety of arsenical smokes and other poisons in battle. The military use of toxins dates from at least the sixth century bce, when Assyrian soldiers poisoned enemy wells with ergot-contaminated rye. In 423 bce, during the Peloponnesian War, Thracian allies of Sparta captured the Athenian fort at Delium by using a long tube and bellows to blow poisonous smoke from coals, sulfur, and pitch into the fort. Greek fire (likely composed of rosin, sulfur, pitch, naphtha, lime, and saltpeter) was invented in the seventh century ce and proved to be a very effective naval weapon. Various poisons saw battlefield use during medieval times, and the use of poisons for murder (including assassinations) became widespread. Other examples before the twentieth century include the contamination of water by dumping the corpses of dead humans or animals into wells, the use of snakes and other creatures as poisonous vectors, and occasionally, fomites to transmit infections such as smallpox to unsuspecting victims. This latter technique was used with remarkable success during the French and Indian War (1754-1767), when Sir Jeffrey Amherst was alleged to have given \u201cgifts\u201d (blankets) harboring the pus and scabs from smallpox victims to unsuspecting Native Americans. The Indians possessed no immunity against smallpox and thus experienced very high rates of infection and mortality as smallpox swept through the local tribes.3\n",

            "text": "During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the science and technology necessary for the development of sophisticated biological and chemical weapons proceeded apace. World War I saw the first large-scale use of \u201cpoison gas,\u201d including lacrimators, chlorine, phosgene, arsenicals, cyanide, and sulfur mustard. By the end of the war, nearly one in every three rounds was a chemical munition. Dr. Shiro Ishii and other Japanese scientists in the infamous Unit 731 worked on the weaponization of anthrax, plague, smallpox, and tetrodotoxin as well as a variety of chemical agents during World War II. There are even suspicions that the bomb used in the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Czechoslovakia in 1942 contained botulinum toxin.4 After World War II, ricin was used as an injectable assassination weapon, and in the 1970s and 1980s T-2 toxin, a trichothecene mycotoxin, was alleged to have been the toxic component of the \u201cyellow rain\u201d employed against H\u2019Mong refugees from Laos. More recently, Iraq and Iran both used chemical weapons against each other in the Iran-Iraq War of the 1980s, and Iraq had a weapons program that included the development of sulfur mustard, nerve agents, \u201cAgent 15\u201d (an anticholinergic incapacitating agent), botulinum toxin, epsilon toxin from Clostridium perfringens, and aflatoxin.5 Militia groups in the United States and terrorist groups throughout the world have used ricin for political purposes.",

Since that time, at least 140 nations have either signed or ratified this treaty.6 However, the Soviet Union and Iraq began violating the treaty in short order. In the Soviet Union, weapons scientists stepped up research and development of numerous biological and chemical weapons as part of one of the largest and most comprehensive biological-weapons programs in history. Soviet scientists created large stockpiles of weaponized anthrax, plague, smallpox, tularemia, nerve agent, mustard, and other biological and chemical agents.5\n",

In that year, a small quantity of weapons-grade anthrax was accidentally released from a manufacturing plant located in the former city of Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) in Russia, resulting in 77 cases and 66 deaths. Dr. Matthew Meselson, a Harvard scientist, was permitted to study the event many years later and reported the results of his work in a 1979 Science article. Meselson determined that the majority of the deaths had occurred among victims living in a narrow, 4-km-wide band downwind from the plant. Animal deaths were confirmed as far as 30 km downwind. Meselson further concluded that less than 1 g of weapons-grade anthrax had been released from the plant.7 If his calculations are accurate, weaponized anthrax possesses staggering potential as a biological weapon given its stability, its relative ease of production, and its ability to be dispersed in a clandestine manner over great distances.",

A large outbreak of avian influenza involving the H5N1 strain and human cases occurred in 2004 and originated in two countries from this region.18 No sustained human-to-human transmission was reported, but there is some evidence that isolated episodes did occur, and the potential exists for genetic reassortment between avian and human or animal strains of influenza. A recent report in the journal Science linked the influenza virus responsible for the 1918 epidemic to a possible avian origin.19 If true, avian influenza may pose a much greater danger to human populations than previously reported. The disease presents in humans in a fashion similar to other types of influenza viruses. It usually begins with fever, chills, headaches, and myalgias and often involves the upper and lower respiratory tract with development of cough, dyspnea, and, in severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome. Laboratory findings may include pancytopenia, lymphopenia, elevated liver enzymes, hypoxia, a positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for H5N1, and a positive neutralization assay for H5N1 influenza strain. in vitro studies suggest that the neuraminidase (NA)-inhibitor class of drugs may have clinical efficacy in the treatment and prevention of avian influenza infection.20\n",

As few as four amino acid substitutions in any two antigenic sites can cause such a clinically significant variation. These minor changes result in an altered virus able to circumvent host immunity. Moreover, genetic reassortment between avian and human or avian and porcine influenza viruses may lead to the major changes in HA or NA surface proteins known as antigenic shift. In contrast to the gradual evolution of strains subject to antigenic drift, antigenic shift occurs when an influenza virus with a completely novel HA or NA formation moves into humans from other host species.

All patients admitted to the hospital with suspected pneumonia should receive the following measures: (1) they should be placed in droplet isolation until it is determined that isolation is no longer indicated (standard precautions are appropriate for most community-acquired pneumonias; droplet precautions for nonavian influenza); (2) they should be screened for risk factors of possible exposure to SARS-CoV; and (3) they should be evaluated with a chest radiograph, pulse oximetry, complete blood count, and additional workup as indicated. If the patient has a risk factor for SARS, droplet precautions should be implemented pending an etiologic diagnosis. When there is a high index of suspicion for SARS-CoV disease, the patient should be treated in terms of SARS isolation precautions immediately (including airborne precautions), and all contacts of the ill patient should be identified, evaluated, and monitored.22 Although ribavirin, high-dose corticosteroids, and interferons have been used in treatment, it is unclear what effect they have had on clinical outcome. No definitive therapy has been established. Empiric antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia following the current American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines is recommended pending etiologic diagnosis. Diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV include antibody testing using an enzyme immunoassay and RT-PCR tests for respiratory, blood, and stool specimens.23 In the absence of known SARS-CoV transmission, testing is recommended only in consultation with public health authorities. Testing for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumococcus, chlamydia, mycoplasma, and legionella should be conducted, as the identification of one of these agents excludes SARS by case definition. Clinical samples can be obtained during the first week of illness with a nasopharyngeal swab plus an oropharyngeal swab and a serum or a plasma specimen. After the first week of illness, a nasopharyngeal swab plus an oropharyngeal swab and a stool specimen should be obtained. Serum specimens for SARS-CoV antibody testing should be collected when the diagnosis is first suspected and at later times as indicated. An antibody response can occasionally be detected during the first week of illness, is likely to be detected by the end of the second week of illness, and at times may not be detected until more than 28 days after the onset of symptoms. Respiratory specimens from any of several different sources may be collected for viral and bacterial diagnostics, but the preferred specimens of choice are nasopharyngeal washes or aspirates.23\n",

            "text": "The threats associated with the use of chemical weapons as battlefield or terrorist weapons are not easy to assess.43\n,\n44 Risk assessment of use must take into account national laws, international treaties and conventions, and the likelihood of adherence to these legal obligations. Loopholes in existing agreements can be exploited to develop weapons that are technically not prohibited by international law. Goals and objectives may vary depending on whether military use is planned at the strategic, tactical, or operational level and whether the developer is a national government, a breakaway republic, a kidnapped or recruited scientist, or a terrorist cell. Risk of use may also depend on whether the targets are military versus civilian, human versus nonhuman (animals or plants, including livestock and crops), or individual (as in assassinations) versus large groups, and on whether the aim is death versus incapacitation. Risk also depends on agent availability and on the technology available for production, storage, and dissemination; current advances in technology are associated with a higher risk of weaponization. Two examples from the twentieth century and one from the twenty-first can illustrate the fallibility of intelligence:1.During most of World War II, the Allied perception of risk from possible chemical agent use by Axis powers focused on those agents, primarily pulmonary agents and vesicants, known from World War I. In fact, Germany had developed a new kind of chemical-warfare agent, the compounds later to be called G-series nerve agents. Their existence came as a complete surprise to Western governments when, in the waning days of the European campaign, Allied soldiers advancing into Germany discovered buried nerve-agent munitions and entire nerve-agent factories. Why these agents were never used on the battlefield is a topic of much speculation, but in retrospect they clearly posed the most lethal, yet unrecognized, threat from Germany.45\n2.Assessment of the chemical threat posed by Saddam Hussein at the time of the Gulf War of 1991 centered on the known Iraqi use of sulfur mustard and nerve agents during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. It was not until 1998 that Reuters News Agency reported the discovery by British intelligence that Iraq had stockpiled large quantities of a \u201cmental incapacitant\u201d (incapacitating agent) known as Agent 15.18\n,\n46\n3.The risk of use of chemical agents by Iraq after 2001 was assessed to be high partly because of the known stockpiles of sulfur mustard and nerve agents (as well as the suspected stockpiles of cyanide and the new revelations about Agent 15) from the time of the 1991 Gulf War. President George W. Bush\u2019s summary in October of 2002 of the National Intelligence Estimates (NIE) states, \u201cBaghdad has begun renewed production of mustard, sarin, GF (cyclosarin), and VX. Although information is limited, Saddam probably has stocked at least 100 and possibly as much as 500 metric tons of CW agents.\u201d However, in 2006 the Iraq Study Group (ISG) Report was released and reported that \u201cwhile a small number of old, abandoned chemical munitions have been discovered, ISG judges that Iraq unilaterally destroyed its undeclared chemical weapons stockpile in 1991.\u201d47 Although the initial intelligence proved to be wrong, it does not invalidate the argument that the risk from these agents, if possessed, would be very concerning.\n",

Some compounds not developed to cause injury or incapacitation nevertheless can be very dangerous; hexachloroethane (HC) smoke, for example, can cause the same type of pulmonary damage induced by phosgene, a chemical weapon used in World War I. The CDC lists nearly 70 separate chemicals, including a variety of toxic industrial chemicals and poisons, as potential agents for terrorism. These include osmium tetroxide, long-acting anticoagulants, heavy metals, toxic alcohols, and white phosphorus.49 The April 21, 2000, Morbidity and Mortality Report included an even longer list of chemical agents that might be used by terrorists.50 Pyrolysis, the thermochemical change of an organic material in the absence of oxygen by heat, and products from explosions and conflagrations may release large quantities of cyanide and other toxicants that, although different from the original chemicals present, may still cause death. Industrial chemicals are readily available in large quantities as preformed compounds and should be considered high on the list of potential terrorist agents.51\n,\n52 Toxins that are chemicals produced within biological organisms also represent high-threat agents.53 New chemicals are currently being synthesized on rigid three-dimensional molecular skeletons, the most promising of which are the norbornanes. Norbornane is a bicyclic crystalline hydrocarbon (C7H12).54 Building on norbornane geometry allows for a modular enhancement of the number of functional sites on a given molecule. Many norbornane derivatives, such as the mixture of chlorobornanes known as the toxaphenes, are persistent and have significant acute and chronic toxicity. These norbornane derivatives have been considered as potential candidates for new agents. Novichok 55, 56, 57, 58 (Russian for \u201cnewcomer\u201d) refers to the alleged Russian development of a highly toxic binary nerve agent or generation of nerve agents (sometimes called \u201cfourth-generation\u201d agents). Only sketchy and unverifiable information is available in the unclassified literature, but the existence of these agents would demonstrate the possibility of creating new chemical compounds toxic enough to be used as chemical warfare or terrorist agents. One of the sources of unclassified information is from a dissident Russian scientist who wrote newspaper articles and published a book about the Novichok program and the types of chemical agents that were produced.59 So-called GV analogs combining some of the properties of G-series and V-series nerve agents have also been suggested as potential new agents.38\n",

The idea was to make storage of chemical rounds safer by stopping the production process at the penultimate synthetic step, resulting in two precursor compounds that when mixed would create the desired agent. These two precursors could then be stored separately. Just before use, one component could be inserted into a round, where it would be separated from the other precursor by a thin membrane. The impact and momentum of the launch of the projectile would burst the membrane to allow for mixing of the components and in-flight production of the chemical agent. In practice, this process was often not complete, but the 20% or so of ancillary reaction product was often extremely toxic by itself. Binarization or some similar production-arrest method could theoretically be used by a clandestine terrorist cell to help evade detection and to decrease the risks associated with the production, transportation, and use of chemical agents.",
