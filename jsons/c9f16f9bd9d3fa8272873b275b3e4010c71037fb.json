The underdetermined nature of these empirical mechanisms hinders estimation in the multivariate setting. Spatiotemporal applications alleviate this by allowing relationships to depend only on relative distances in real Euclidean space; we employ this framework as a vessel for embedding arbitrary event types in a new latent space. We demonstrate that learning the embedding alongside a point process model is resilient to ambiguities in the relationships among event types by performing synthetic experiments on short records as well as an investigation into options markets and pathogens.",

Understanding their intrinsic dynamics is of paramount scientific and strategic value: a particular series of discrete options trades may inform an observer on the fluctuating dispositions of market agents; similarly, temporal news publication patterns may betray an ensuing shift in the public zeitgeist. The spread of a novel pathogen, notably the COVID-19 virus, through disjointed pockets of the globe hints to how it proliferates, and how that might be averted [8] . Practically estimating the (n \u00d7 n ) possible excitations between each dyad (pair) of event types is untenable without succinct and interpretable parametrizations. How can one possibly disentangle the contributions of hundreds of options trades within each minute, in a myriad of different strike prices and expiration dates, to the Poisson intensity of a particular type of trade? We must envision the right kind of bias for our model. Spatiotemporal domains [9, 3, 10] exploit physical constraints on interaction locality. In essence, the influence one event bears on another is governed solely by their separation in space, invariant to absolute positioning. We show that it is feasible to conjure a latent spatial representation of the interacting event types by harnessing a spatiotemporal point process, and maximizing their joint likelihood. Much like word embeddings extracted from text corpora and graph embeddings from social networks, we tailor the latent space to capture the system under question: namely the precise interactions between events. Out-of-sample log likelihoods and a number of predictive metrics are improved with this structural imposition in applications that are both spatial and explicitly not spatial.",

In fact, note the meteoric rise of work in Bayesian inference that now permeates serially dependent point processes. Zhang et al. [37] sample the branching structure p i j (see Eq. 6) in order to carefully infer the underlying Gaussian process that constitutes the influence function. Gaussian processes, usually with latent inducing points, are also a prevailing assumption for the direct modulation of the intensity function [38, 36, 39, 40, 41] . Linderman and Adams [42] took an approach that estimated a matrix very similar to our [\u03d5 i j r ], though relied on discretized binning and variational approximation-both of which we avoid. Salehi et al. [31] exploited a reparametrization trick akin to those in variational autoencoders in order to efficiently estimate the tensor of basis-function coefficients. Apostolopoulou et al. [43] augmented the excitatory model with a nonlinear term that enabled the full a posteriori inference of a model with inhibitions, sans variational approximation.
