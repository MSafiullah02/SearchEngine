            "text": "In the absence of a vaccine the medical and scientific community is looking intensely at utilizing a pre or post exposure drug that could decrease viremia. The search for a medication that could reduce risk of serious disease, and ideally of any disease and of asymptomatic shedding of SARS-CoV2 is of urgent interest, particularly to decrease the risk to health care workers, first responders, and others with high risk of exposure to patients with COVID19. The prospect of protecting health-care workers against COVID-19 based on repurposing of existing pharmaceuticals is among one of the recent scientific debates [1,2]. The value of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a prophylactic needs careful documented, empirical research in this context [3]. In order to obtain strong clinical evidence, a large number of scientists and teams have launched prospective studies that were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov over a short period of time. The detailed analysis of these studies, some of them already recruiting, will give an overall picture of HCQ use as a COVID-19 prophylaxis around the world. This will help to identify the gaps to be fulfilled with the idea of getting definitive evidence on the positioning of HCQ for COVID-19 prophylaxis in exposed health-care workers.",

The range of the loading doses was from 400 to 1400 mg on day 1 (Table 1). The most common daily doses were 400 mg (12/31 (39%)) and 200 mg (9/31 (29%)); a 600 mg daily dose was less common and was recorded for only 13% (4/31) of the studies. The remaining six studies used weekly doses of 400 mg (Table 2). Regarding the duration of prophylaxis, it was highly variable, ranging from 5 to 180 days (median = 40 days) for daily regimen, and 3 to 24 weeks for weekly regimen (median = 12 weeks). Of note, the most frequent prophylactic regimen (6/31 (19%)) was an HCQ loading dose of 800 mg on day 1, followed by HCQ 400 mg for four additional days. Among the studies (n = 5) that did not use a loading dose but a 400 mg daily dose, duration of prophylaxis was highly diverse from 4 to 180 days (median = 60). For the studies (n = 2) that reported a 200 mg daily dose, one study used a loading dose of 800 mg on day 1 and 2, followed by 90 days of 200 mg HCQ, and the other one used a loading dose of 400 mg from day 1 to 3, followed by 14 days of 200 mg HCQ.",

This very active recording in ClinicalTrials.gov demonstrates the huge interest of the scientific community regarding this question. Indeed, the debate continues to rage regarding the use of HCQ for COVID-19 and we need to shed more light based on clinical evidence. At the present time, the debate is still a non-documented speculation that will be ended in the next few months.",

The negative point of the high diversity in HCQ dosage and duration of prophylaxis could be that the conclusion of these different studies may be conflicting. Indeed, it would be surprising that a 200 mg daily dose during one month would have the same efficacy and the same ratio benefit/risk than a 600 mg daily dose during three months. As a consequence, the final analysis of these trials should be done through an extensive reading of the results in regards to the clinical design, rather than quickly glancing a 140 characters-based social media message announcing the failure or success of a drug against a disease.",
