It was reported 64 that the nucleocapsid protein inhibited type I interferon production after virion infected the host cells 65 (Hu et al., 2017) , which was considered as a possible mechanism of immune escape. The 66 nucleocapsid protein inhibited cell cytokinesis and proliferation (Zhou et al., 2008) , and regulated 67 several pathways, such as transforming growth factor-beta signaling (Zhao et al., 2008) , AP-1 signal 68 transduction pathway (He et al., 2003) , and NF-KappaB pathway (Zhang et al., 2007b) .

The primary function of 270 nucleocapsid protein was to package the viral genome into nucleocapsids to protect the genomic 271 RNA (McBride et al., 2014). During the formation of nucleocapsids, numerous nucleocapsid proteins 272 bound to the viral RNA and started oligomerization. The viral reproductive strategies would 273 synthesize nucleocapsid proteins as many as possible to meet the requirements of viral assembly, 274 which meant the nucleocapsid proteins were overproduced. The findings that redundant nucleocapsid 275 proteins interfered with the normal physiology of host cells were reported (Surjit et al., 2004; Zhao et 276 al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007a; Zhao et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2017).
