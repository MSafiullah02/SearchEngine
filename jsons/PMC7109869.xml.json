Therefore, we first determined the optimal cultivation conditions using a fermentor to obtain comparable yield with a 2-l flask cultivation. In the early log phase of cultivation at 30 \u00b0C, the growth curve of 2-l flask cultivation by using a shaker at 160 rpm was similar to that obtained by using a fermentor (aeration, 20 l/min; agitation, 220 rpm) (Fig. 1A and B). However, after the middle log phase, the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the fermentor rapidly decreased, probably because of the rapid increase in the number of E. coli cells, which would reduce growth in the late-middle log phase and make it difficult to harvest cells at the same condition every time. To address this issue, we lowered the cultivation temperature to 25 \u00b0C to prolong the growth condition until the late log phase. Although cultivation at lower temperatures slowed the growth rate, the culture condition in the late-log phase became reproducible (Fig. 1C). In practice, harvesting according to the OD600 exceeding 2.5 yielded almost the same weight of cells in repeated cultivations (Table I). The 2.5 OD600 is usable as an indicator for the mid-late log phase. The pH of the culture medium was comparable between the two temperatures examined.\n",

            "text": "Next, we optimized the process of harvesting and washing cells, which is traditionally accomplished by repeated centrifugation (25, 27). Because tangential flow filtration (TFF) is a well-established technique for the rapid concentration of bacterial culture or marine waters (48), we attempted to use it to harvest and wash cells for preparing cell extract with high efficiency of protein synthesis on a laboratory scale. The TFF system comprises a pump, pressure valves and a filtration membrane (Fig. 2A). The required operation time is estimated by considering the flow rate of the permeate through a given area of membrane per unit time (flux), commonly expressed by using the unit l/m2/h (LMH). Flux depends on transmembrane pressure (TMP), which is the difference between the pressures on the upstream (applied pressure) and the downstream (permeate) surfaces of the membrane. It is calculated using the equation TMP = [Pfeed (P1) + Pretentate (P2)]/2 \u2212 Ppermeate (P3). In the TFF system, the tangential flow of the circulating cell solution on the surface of the filtration membrane should be large enough, so that the permeate passes continuously through the membrane without clogging it. Circulating flow rate is controlled by the pump output, affected by the module architecture and pressure resistance of intended targets, and indicated as the difference between pressure Pfeed (P1) and Pretentate (P2). It is represented as delta-P. The system is configured by modulating TMP and delta-P, the values of which should be determined experimentally within the range where flux increases linearly with respect to TMP. Once the effect of TMP on the flux of the membrane is characterized, the system can be easily scaled up by increasing the filtration area.\n",

During these examinations, we also measured the pH and conductivity of the permeate to estimate the required amounts of cell washing buffer.

The addition of \u2018N11-tag\u2019, whose sequence is similar to that of the poly-histidine affinity tag (HAT) (31, 62), to the N-terminus exhibited 20-fold increase in the yield of GST-GFPS2 fusion protein (N11GST-GFPS2 in Fig. 6), suggesting that this problem could be overcome by altering the N-terminal sequence of GST. Therefore, the N-terminal three amino acids, MSP, were replaced with MKP, MSD and MKD to examine the productivities. The replacement of the second amino acid, serine, with lysine improved the efficiency either with AAA or AAG codon, and the third amino acid proline substitution for aspartate showed moderate and additional effects on the productivity (Fig. 6). The sequence MKD encoded by ATGAAAGAT improved productivity the most significantly. These results are consistent with previous reports that translation efficiency in vivo and in vitro is affected by the second codon in an open reading frame (63\u201365). Although an optimum reaction condition for synthesis of a target protein fused to GST would be a little different from those for GST-GFPS2, the replacement of the N-terminal amino acids with MKD is an enough improvement for detection of a target protein in the first screening with linear DNA templates.\n",

If nucleotides and oligonucleotides are not removed completely from the S30 extract during the diafiltration step, the protein synthesis activity, defined as protein yield (mg) per A260, would be significantly reduced. Using TFF in this step makes presents the A260 of the permeate as a direct indicator of the nucleotide concentration that can be used to ensure adequate removal of low molecular weight chemicals and batch-to-batch consistency with regard to the protein synthesis efficiency. S30 extract prepared with our new procedure exhibited \u223c2-fold higher activity per cell weight compared with those of Multi-beads Shocker, probably because the high-pressure homogenizer disrupted cells more effectively than did Multi-beads Shocker (Table IV). The average activity of six preparations was 9.9 \u00b5g/A260, which corresponded to 3.1 mg/g of cells.\n",

Although they appear to be useful, for example, for screening of E. coli strain suitable for cell-free protein synthesis, it is uncertain whether they could be applied for repeated large-scale productions. As being the other approaches, inorganic pyrophosphate, a metabolite of ATP regeneration by creatine phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate, that inhibits protein synthesis, could be utilized as a phosphate donor to regenerate ATP by addition of maltose as a carbon source (68, 69). It improved the cell-free protein synthesis efficiency in a batch mode reaction significantly. The other group has reported that a decrease of the concentration of magnesium ion leads to 16S rRNA degradation in a cell-free protein synthesis system using E. coli A19 strain (70), which may be related to the accumulation of pyrophosphate (71). Therefore, not only improvement of procedures for cell extract but also further analyses of the metabolic processes during in vitro protein synthesis reaction are needed. Furthermore, we intend to use the S30 extract prepared in this procedure as a basic condition and to expand applicable products by addition of purified enzymes useful for production efficiency and detergents for membrane proteins.",
