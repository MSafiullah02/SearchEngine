            "text": "Climate change is one of the biggest threats to health in this century (Costello et al., 2009). It has been suggested that increasing effects of thermal stress could contribute a large number of excess deaths (Basu and Samet, 2002). A substantial body of epidemiological evidence has demonstrated that exposure to temperature exceeding certain comfort limits is associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality (Mercer, 2003; Basu, 2009). Older people are more susceptible to thermal stress due to their diminished ability to perceive thermal variation (Collins et al., 1981) and the reduction in thermoregulatory response (Kenney and Armstrong, 1996; Keim et al., 2002). Even mild heat or cold exposure may lead to adverse health outcomes among these vulnerable persons. Other factors including sex, lifestyle, health and socioeconomic status of an individual are also potential effect modifiers of thermal stress (Kovats and Hajat, 2008; Basu, 2009). However, the majority of epidemiological reports on health effects of thermal stress are ecological studies using morbidity or mortality of population-based data. Detailed information on individual risk factors is usually not available from aggregate data, which makes it difficult to quantify effect modifications by individual characteristics. Inconsistent findings have been reported in studies on effect modification by sex on thermal stress associated mortality (The Eurowinter Group, 1997; Wilkinson et al., 2001; O'Neill, 2003; Schwartz, 2005; Diaz et al., 2006; Medina-Ram\u00f3n et al., 2006; Davie et al., 2007).",

All of these studies focused on the assessment of excess risks of heat waves or winter periods, but all were conducted in temperate regions and none has addressed the association between daily exposure to climatic variables and mortality. In Hong Kong, a typical subtropical city, the effects of thermal stress on mortality have only been reported in studies based on population-level data (Yan, 2000; Leung et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2012). However, the results were not consistent, which may be attributed to the use of different methods and indicators of thermal stress.",

Vapor pressure (E) was calculated using the following equation (National Weather Service, 2009):E=6.11\u00d710[7.5\u00d7Td/(237.7+Td)]where Td is dew point (\u00b0C).",

Previous reports suggested that effects of heat stress are immediate and restricted to current and the following day (Braga et al., 2001; O'Neill, 2003; Stafoggia et al., 2006), and in most studies the strongest heat effects occurred in very short lag periods (Basu et al., 2005; Anderson and Bell, 2009). However, cold effects usually occur after an interval and are more persistent through time (The Eurowinter Group, 1997; Mercer, 2003; Anderson and Bell, 2009). The use of different lags to identify thresholds for cold and heat effects according to their distinct lag patterns could help to avoid underestimation of thermal stress effects. Therefore, we chose the conservative threshold with lag 3 day instead of lag 0\u20131 days to identify the effects of cool days. A previous study from Hong Kong also reported that the greatest correlation coefficients between minimum net effective temperature (NET) and mortality from all causes, CVD and RD occurred at lag 3 or 4 days in winter (November\u2013March) (Leung et al., 2008). Our results support the phenomenon that cold effects are associated with long lags as positive associations between cold exposure and mortality could be observed for lags up to 30 days (Appendix Table A3). This effect of cold stress on mortality may be attributed to the mechanism of cold effects which are more likely to be indirectly mediated through changes in blood composition and blood pressure or infection with a longer time elapsed before death (The Eurowinter Group, 1997; Cheng and Su, 2010).",

The difference in the thresholds may be due to the inclusion of relative humidity and wind speed factors in the derivation of AT. In addition, because the threshold defined in our study was based on data from mortality of an elderly population, which has been demonstrated to be more vulnerable to thermal stress (Ballester et al., 1997; Gouveia, 2003; O'Neill et al., 2005a; Hajat et al., 2007; Baccini et al., 2008; Ishigami et al., 2008; Anderson and Bell, 2009), the threshold of temperature for detectable heat effects in older populations is known to be lower than that for the general population.",

            "text": "We found statistically significant effects of cold stress during cool days but not of heat effect during hot days for exposure at the same or previous day before death. We were able to identify a threshold for heat effects in the general elderly population but no heat effect for our cohort subjects was observed. It may be that the subjects of the cohort were self selected to be enrolled in the Elderly Health Service and were generally more health conscious. Our results are consistent with previous findings from another Hong Kong study, which reported 1.0%\u20132.0% increase in all-cause, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in winter but no significant increased risk for a unit change of NET in summer (May\u2013September) (Leung et al., 2008). However, these results do not concur with those of Chan et al. (2012) who reported that heat effects on excess mortality from natural causes, were associated with daily mean air temperature above 28.2 \u00b0C in summer. There are two possible explanations for these differences. First, there may be important differences between our cohort subjects and the general elderly population. Second, the thermal indices used in the three Hong Kong studies are different. Both AT and NET take into account the effects of humidity and wind speed. AT was developed based on the principles of human physiology and clothing (Steadman, 1979) and widely used in studies on health effects of thermal stress (O'Neill et al., 2005b; Stafoggia et al., 2006; Analitis et al., 2008; Basu and Ostro, 2008; Anderson and Bell, 2009). It has been recognized that changes of relative humidity and wind speed could affect the capacity of sweat vaporization and alter heat exchange between human body and the environment (Gaffin and Moran, 2001; Keim et al., 2002). A local study also documented wind speed as one of the factors that impact on the thermal comfort of people in Hong Kong (Cheng et al., 2012). Therefore, AT is considered to be a better thermal stress measure than air temperature alone.",

Lower or absent heat effects in warmer cities were observed in most multi-city studies (Anderson and Bell, 2009; Hajat and Kosatky, 2010). So the absence of a strong heat effect might be expected in a subtropical city like Hong Kong. An important environmental factor may be air conditioning which is commonly used in summer. The excess consumption of electricity in summer is mainly attributed to air conditioning which accounts for 59.1% of the power consumed, whereas in winter only 2.6% of the electricity consumed is dedicated for space heating (Yee et al., 2004). Acclimatization of the residents and frequent public warnings on the potential adverse health effects of heat exposure may also contribute to the reduction of heat effects (Chau et al., 2009).",

In our cohort, higher rates of pre-existing hypertension, heart diseases, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus were recorded among subjects with the highest BMI level (Appendix Table A4). Increases in blood pressure, plasma cholesterol and plasma \ufb01brinogen levels under cold exposure would aggravate these co-morbidities by increasing the risks of cardiovascular events. On the other hand, significant excess risk was not observed inobese subjects for respiratory mortality. It is possibly related to the smaller sample size as well as the lower prevalence of chronic obstructive airways diseases and asthma in obese subjects compared with normal weight range subjects in the cohort.",

This finding agrees with previous ecological studies on cold stress which reported a higher risk in females (The Eurowinter Group, 1997; Wilkinson et al., 2001; Schwartz, 2005; Diaz et al., 2006; Davie et al., 2007). An investigation on the thermal comfort of a Chinese population also confirmed that females preferred a warmer environment than males with a comfortable operative temperature of 26.2 \u00b0C for females and 25.3 \u00b0C for males (Lan et al., 2008), but the mechanisms underlying sex differences in temperature preferences and physiological responses to thermal stress were not fully explained. Several potential modifiers of thermal stress have been suggested including the sexual dimorphism of body fatness (Hardy and Bois, 1940; Burse, 1979), the higher thermal-metabolic threshold for females (Cunningham et al., 1978) and differences in the endocrine milieu between males and females (Graham et al., 1989). It is possible that the larger body surface to mass ratios and lower resting metabolic rates of females contribute to the higher susceptibility to cold stress (Arciero et al., 1993).",

Second, all the meteorological variables used in our study were recorded from the Hong Kong Observatory, so the apparent temperature could be different from the actual individual exposures, especially for subjects living in suburban areas. Third, as the number of cases in each stratum is not large enough, it is unlikely to have sufficient statistical power for assessment with further stratification, like for obese or non-obese female groups.
