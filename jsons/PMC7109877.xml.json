Several \u2018pipelines\u2019 for discovery of novel ncRNA motifs by comparative genomics have been described (Pedersen et al., 2006; Rivas et al., 2001; Bradley et al., 2007; Washietl et al., 2005) adding to a comprehensive database of known ncRNA alignments (Griffiths-Jones et al., 2003). Visual inspection of alignments is an important quality control step in such pipelines.",

Non-coding RNAs in particular, however, often do not exhibit conservation at the sequence level but do display conservation at the structural level. Compensatory mutations of the bases in an RNA alignment are a signature of this structural-level conservation. (By \u2018compensatory mutations\u2019 we mean substitutions of both the sites involved in a base-pair, such that canonical Watson-Crick or wobble base-pairing is maintained: although we do not know in which order the two substitutions occurred, we presume that the second substitution \u2018compensated\u2019 for the first.) When eyballing an RNA alignment to determine if it includes a structural ncRNA, it is extremely helpful to have a visual indicator of such mutations.",
