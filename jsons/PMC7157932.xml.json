            "text": "In recent history, the Mediterranean diet has been the subject of much interest because of its association in Mediterranean populations with reduced incidence of some chronic diseases including cancer, coronary heart disease (CHD), and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which represent in industrialized countries, ,75% of deaths for individuals of age 65 and older [1]. The beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet have been ascribed at least in part to high intake of antioxidants from fruits and vegetables, nuts, the prevalent consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids from olive oil, a moderately high intake of fish, and a regular but moderate intake of wine primarily during meals 2., 3.. The health benefits of the Mediterranean diet have also been attributed to ingestion of a variety of botanical preparations from herbs and spices, which provide rich sources of flavor-giving and bioactive components including phenolic compounds that possess antioxidant properties [4]. The literature concerning the cultivation and culinary use of vegetables, herbs, and spices in the Mediterranean area date back to the ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Roman civilizations [5]. In modern history, there has been an increasing research focus to define the health benefits of dietary constituents found in traditional Mediterranean foods [6] with the objective of identifying bioactive components and develop strategies for their functional use in preventive medicine and maintenance of health 7., 8.. Traditionally, herbs are referred to as leafy parts of plants, whereas the term spices is generally adopted for preparations from roots, seeds, root bark, berries, flower parts, fruits, or other plant parts. The main objective of this chapter is to discuss the health benefits of a selected group of traditional culinary and medicinal Mediterranean plants for which we deemed sufficient scientific literature information is available to support their potential use in food preparations or for preventative and therapeutic applications (Table 26.1\n). Purposely, we have not covered vegetables and herbs that have been covered extensively in previous scientific reviews and limited our focus to selected traditional Mediterranean plants. Specific emphasis is given to the profile of bioactive components; the chemistry and mechanisms of action of bioactive compounds; the health benefits associated with intake; potential toxicity; and recommendations for consumption.",

            "text": "Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis Linn. Family Labiatae) is a perennial plant native of the Mediterranean area. Rosemary extracts are used routinely for cooking, preservation of foods, cosmetics, or in herbal medicine for anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial applications 9., 10., and for the prevention and treatment of diabetic and cardiovascular diseases [11]. At least 30 components have been identified in essential oils, which have been shown to possess olfactory properties that influence cognitive performance including memory [12]. Rosemary extracts contain many bioactive components including phenolic mono-terpenes (\u03b1-pinene, camphene, limonene) [13], diterpenes (carnosic acid, carnosol), flavones (genkwanin, isoscutellarein 7-O-glucoside), and caffeolyl derivatives (rosmarinic acid). The highest accumulation of these groups of compounds occurs in leaves and it is related to young stages of plant development\n[14]. In general, rosmarinic acid is present at the highest concentration in all rosemary plant organs. Carnosic acid and carnosol are found in stems during young stages, but their concentrations decrease in the vascular system following aging. However, high levels of phenolic diterpenes and rosmarinic acid are found in flowers as a result of in situ biosynthesis and transport from other plant organs. Rosemary extracts in both aqueous and lipid medium have been shown to possess antioxidant activity, which is due to the presence of a catechol group in the aromatic ring of the phenolic terpenes, and cathecols conjugated with a carboxylic acid group in rosmarinic acid. Interestingly, rosmarinic acid is more effective as antioxidant in bulk oil whereas carnosol and carnosic acid perform better in oil-in-water emulsions. These differences in antioxidant efficacy have been attributed to interfacial partitioning of these compounds [15].\n",

            "text": "Many studies have investigated the health benefits of extracts from rosemary plants and documented that extracts exhibited protective effects against oxidative damage to DNA by scavenging hydroxyl and singlet oxygen radicals [16], and prevented the activation of carcinogens by members of P450 family of metabolizing enzymes while increasing detoxification 17., 18.. Aqueous extracts of the young sprouts of rosemary were found to exert anti-lipoperoxidant activity, and protected against radiation-induced hepatotoxicity in Swiss albino mice [19]. Similarly, the oral administration (250 mg/kg body weight) of rosemary extracts to male Sprague-Dawley rats reduced tetrachloride-induced acute hepatotoxicity [20]. Moreover, dietary rosemary extracts at doses ranging from 0.5% to 1.0% were reported to suppress the binding of dimethyl-benz[a]anthracene (DMBA) metabolites to DNA in female Sprague-Dawley rats 21., 22., DNA damage by the carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene [23], and at doses of 500 mg/kg body weight DMBA-induced skin tumors in mice [24]. Extracts of rosemary have also been shown to possess antiviral effects against Herplex simplex\n[25] and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which is recognized as the primary etiological factor in the development of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease [26]. In association with vitamin D3, rosemary preparations and carnosic acid enhanced differentiation of HL60 cells in vitro and exerted antileukemic activity in Balb/c mice [27]. A recent study that screened herb extracts for antithrombotic effects in vitro and in a mouse model reported that rosemary along with thyme extracts showed significant antithrombotic activity possibly through an inhibitory effect on platelet reactivity [28]. Interestingly, the same study reported that the anti-platelet activity of rosemary was heat-stable suggesting that the active components may remain preserved after cooking.",

In humans, rosmarinic acid is absorbed, conjugated, and methylated in the intestine and liver and it is present in plasma and urine in a conjugated form (glucuronide and/or sulfated). Metabolites of rosmarinic acid have been shown to be excreted within few hours 32., 33..",

The genus name of the licorice plant, Glycyrrhiza, is derived from the ancient Greek words for \u201csweet root\u201d\u2018 (glykos=sweet and rhiza=root) [60]. The sweetness of licorice is from the glycyrrhizin contained in the root and is 50 times sweeter than sucrose [61]. Native to southeastern Europe, the licorice root was used as something sweet to chew on and the black juice extract was taken as a refreshing drink by both the Greeks and Romans. Today licorice is found in candies, soft drinks, tobacco products, cough syrups, Guinness beer, and sambuca [60]. Medicinal uses of licorice throughout antiquity included treatment for asthma, cough, skin lesions, ulcers (bladder, stomach, and kidney pain), and diseases of the liver and arteries. Licorice also shows anti-inflammatory and mineralocorticoid properties due to the activity of glycyrrhizinic acid and its metabolite glycyrrhetinic acid, which inhibit cortisol metabolism. Recent studies have shown licorice to possess antiatherogenic effects, and that the presence of saponins and flavonoids in the root provide antioxidant activity [59]. Modern research has verified these uses finding licorice to be an effective expectorant and antiviral agent, as well as an aid for healing stomach and duodenal ulcers [61].",

Following hydrolysis, glycyrrhizin is converted to two molecules of glucuronic acid and the aglycone glycyrrhetinic acid [59]. Glycyrrhizic acid and glycyrrhetinic acid competitively inhibit the enzyme 11\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [62]. 11\u03b2-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase normally catalyzes the oxidation of the active cortisol in the kidney, to the inactive cortisone. The inhibition of cortisol metabolism by glycyrrhizic/glycyrrhetinic acid increases cortisol activity in the kidney. Cortisol has the same affinity to the aldosterone receptors as aldosterone and the effects mimic aldosterone excess [63]. The resulting hypermineralocorticoidism is characterized by sodium retention, hypokalemia, and hypertension [64].",

Licorice is useful in treating gastric and duodenal ulcers as it reduces stomach secretions and produces protective mucus for the lining of the digestive tract [66]. The anti-inflammatory and anti-allergenic activity of licorice arises mainly from the presence of the flavones liquiritin and liquiritigenin which can treat rheumatism and arthritis. These properties are further extended to the treatment of atopic dermatitis; reducing erythema, edema, and itching [67]. Licorice possesses anti-viral properties and has long been used in the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis [61]. In vitro studies have reported anti-viral effects for the influenza virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus, the Hepatitis B virus, and the Epstein Barr virus [59]. The antioxidant activity of licorice stems from the presence of saponins and flavonoids which are known for their antioxidant activity. Of the flavonoids present in the root, isoliquiritigenin is among the most potent [68]. Licorice is also useful as a gentle laxative [66].",

References to chamomile are found in medicinal writings of the ancient Egyptian, Greek, and Romans. The writings of Hippocrates, Dioscorides, and Galen contain descriptions of the chamomile plant. The Greeks and Egyptians used crushed chamomile flowers to treat the skin conditions erythema and xerosis caused by dry, harsh weather [69]. Chamomile is one of the most widely used herbs and has been traditionally used for its mild sedative, spasmolytic, anti-inflammatory, and wound healing properties [70]. The German E Commission has approved chamomile for internal use to treat gastrointestinal spasms and inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, the German E Commission has approved external use of chamomile for inflammation of the skin and bacterial skin diseases, and respiratory tract inflammation [65]. In the United States, chamomile is one of the most widely consumed tea ingredients [70].",

            "text": "The saponifiable fraction of olive oil consists of 98.5\u201399.5% of olive oil and the remainder accounts for the unsaponifiable fraction [91]. Olive oil consists primarily of oleic acid (55.0\u201383.0%) [91]. Additional fatty acids present in olive oil include palmitic acid (7.5\u201320.0%), stearic (0.5\u20135.0%), linoleic (3.5\u201321.0%), linolenic (0.0\u20130.9%), and palmitoleic acid (0.3\u20133.5%) [91]. Oleic acid (18:1 n9) is a monounsaturated fatty acid containing one double bond, making it less susceptible to oxidation compared to polyunsaturated fatty acids with multiple double bonds. Therefore, olive oil tends to have a longer shelf-life than many other oils containing higher amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids [92]. In addition, antioxidant phenolic compounds increase the stability of extra-virgin olive oils compared to refined virgin olive oil [93]. Long-term storage and heating can lead to degradation and changes in the composition of olive oil.",

            "text": "Phenolic compounds also contribute to the health benefits of olive oil, of which 30 have been identified. The major phenolic compounds identified in olive oil belong to five different classes: simple phenols (hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol), secoiridoids (oleuropein, ligstroside, and their hydrolysis derivatives), lignans (pinoresinol and acetoxypinoresinol), flavonoids (luteolin and apigenin), and phenolic acids (p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid). The reported total amount of phenolic compounds contained in olive oils ranges widely in the literature (between 200 mg/kg and 1500 mg/kg). The phenolic compounds are found in higher amounts in the less processed extra virgin olive oil [91]. In addition, the concentration of phenolic compounds depends on the cultivar, degree of maturation, climate, and extraction procedures 91., 94.. The phenolic compound that has been implicated for the bitter taste of olive oil is oleuropein [95]. In dried, unripe olives oleuropein accounts for approximately 14% of the dried weight. However, as the olive matures oleuropein undergoes hydrolysis to several simple phenols that contribute to the complex taste of olive oil. The phenols in the olive fruit are present in the more polar and hydrophobic glycoside form, whereas the phenols present in olive oil are found in the more lipid-soluble aglyconic form. Mediterranean diets rich in olive oil supply approximately 10\u201320 mg of phenolic compounds per day [96]. In addition to fatty acids and phenolic compounds, olive oil contains thousands of other components including tocopherols (\u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3-, and \u03b4-) and \ue062-carotene (which along with chlorophylls is responsible for the color of the oil). Olive oil also contains approximately 0.7% squalene [88].",

Diets containing extra virgin olive oil increased the resistance of LDL to oxidation [112]. Numerous randomized, controlled, crossover human studies have examined the effects of phenolic compounds from olive oil on markers of DNA and lipid damage [summarized in 100]. Cumulatively, these studies have produced conflicting results in regards to the antioxidant effects of the phenolic olive oil compounds in vivo. However, recent results from the EUROLIVE study provided evidence that phenolic compounds from olive possess in vivo antioxidant properties. The EUROLIVE study was a large, crossover trial conducted with 200 individuals from five different European countries [113]. Participants were given 3 similar olive oils (25 ml/day) with different phenolic contents for intervals of 3 weeks followed by 2-week washout periods. The greatest increases in HDL cholesterol levels and greatest decreases in lipid oxidative damage were observed during ingestion of olive oil containing the highest phenolic content [113].",

Numerous epidemiological studies have reported an inverse correlation between olive oil consumption and the incidence of cancers of the prostate [114], breast [115], colon [116], and oral cavity [117]. In comparison to other types of fatty acids, fewer experimental animal studies have investigated the role olive oil on tumor development and have produced inconsistent results [118]. Several mechanisms of action have been investigated in vitro for the anti-cancer properties of olive oil and its constituents including modulation of signal transduction pathways, regulation of gene expression, alteration of the immune system, and modification of cell membrane structure and function [118]. Furthermore, the antioxidant properties of olive oil may reduce the formation of DNA adducts by decreasing oxidative stress from lipid peroxidation [97]. In vitro experiments documented that olive oil down-regulated the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and Bcl-2 [119]. Minor polar compounds from olive oil inhibited NF-kappaB translocation in monocytes and monocyte-derived-macrophages isolated from healthy volunteers [120]. Oleuropeuin aglycone isolated from extra virgin olive oil was found to inhibit cleavage of the HER2 extracellular domain (ECD) and subsequent HER2 expression in breast cancer cells resistant to trastuzumab (Herceptin) [121]. In addition, the oleuropeuin aglycone enhanced the trastuzumab-induced down-regulation of HER2 expression [121]. Phenolic extracts from olive oil inhibited the invasion of HT115 human colon carcinoma cells in the Matrigel invasion assay [122]. In HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells, hydroxytyrosol inhibited cell cycle progression and altered expression levels of proteins associated with cell cycle regulation including cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 6, cyclin D3, p21, and p27 [123]. In colon cancer cells lines, pinoresinol-rich olive oil induced the ATM-p53 cascade [124].",

In a prospective cross-over study, obese and type 2 diabetes patients (n=11) were placed on three different diets including a diet high in saturated fat, a diet rich in monounsaturated fat in the form of extra virgin olive oil, and a diet rich in carbohydrates [126]. The diet rich in olive oil decreased postprandial glucose and insulin concentrations, increased HDL cholesterol, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) concentrations as compared with the carbohydrate rich diet. In another study, the effects of virgin olive oil consumption on changes in membrane fatty acids and signaling proteins were examined in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes (n=16) compared to a control group (n=28). After 4 weeks of olive oil consumption, significant modifications were noted in the fatty acid composition of plasma membrane and there was a reduction in G-protein subunits (G\u03b1s and G\u00df) and protein kinase C alpha (PKC\u03b1). These results suggest that diets rich in olive oil may influence glycemic homeostasis through alteration of membrane lipids and signaling proteins [127].",
