            "text": "Phage display has been used to isolate specific peptides to isolated proteins, inorganic material and complex target structures.29 In this study, the immobilized S1 protein was used as target. Several phages harboring different peptides were identified in protein-based ELISA for the first time. DNA sequencing indicated that 8 of the 10 selected phages shared a consensus peptide, and the other 2 shared a consensus peptide. Interestingly, a putative motif, WHP, was found in all the 10 peptides, suggesting the selected motif may be indispensable in binding to SARS-CoV S1 protein. To confirm the specific recognition of the phage-displayed peptides to the S1 protein, we analyzed their interaction with the S1 proteins from several coronaviruses. The data showed that these identified phages recognized SARS-CoV S1 protein exclusively. They did not react with other S1 proteins indicating that the reaction is specific. At the same time, when we used the same phage bearing an unrelated peptide, no positive result was observed, implying that the reaction was mediated by the S1 protein specific peptides. It has been reported that little evolution has been occurring within SARS-CoV S proteins30; however, more SARS-CoV isolates should be analyzed in the future to confirm the specificity of the phage-based ELISA. Interestingly, when we used the SARS-CoV S1 protein as sample in a Western blot, the phage displayed peptides did not recognize this protein, and this result was consistent with that of our ELISA with the use of denaturated SARS-CoV S1 protein (data not shown). These pieces of evidence indicate that denaturation of the target protein may affect the interaction with their ligand peptides. Mutation of these identified peptide sequences will be done to clarify their function in our further study. In this study, we wanted to use the S1-binding peptides to establish an indirect ELISA to detect SARS-CoV. To analyze the specificity of such an ELISA, several viruses including MHV, a virus that is genetically more closely related to SARS-CoV, human coronavirus 229E, porcine coronaviruses TGEV and PEDV, the avian coronavirus IBV and the porcine arterivirus PRRSV, were selected as controls in this study. The specific peptide-bearing phages could be used as diagnostic reagents in indirect ELISA to differentiate the inactivated SARS-CoV specifically from above-mentioned viruses. As the control phage bearing phage complex from the phage library only had a negligible effect, the current result indicated that the phage-based ELISA was mainly mediated by the foreign peptides displayed on the surface of these phages.",
