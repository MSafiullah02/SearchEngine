Surgery for those who test positive for COVID-19 should be postponed until test results are negative, where possible. However, due to laboratory constraints in the face of the extremely large number of suspect cases, the capacity for routine swabs is not always available.",

This was based on reports from Wuhan, China, that there was a high infection rate among ENT surgeons, and that the use of PAPRs anecdotally reduced the rate of transmission. A caveat was that the reports were not specific about whether the transmissions occurred during the actual surgery or during other perioperative phases (e.g., intubation, extubation, postoperative period). Our local consensus from Infectious Disease input is that for AGPs, even in COVID-19\u2013positive patients, a properly fitted, molded, and handled N95 mask; eye protection (goggles/full face shield); and standard PPE (gown and gloves) should be adequate.6,7 Nevertheless, because there is uncertainty over the exact mechanisms of virus transmission, degree of aerosolization, amount of viral load exposure, and lack of data on appropriate PPE in endonasal AGPs, a more cautious stance was adopted in which the entire surgical and anesthetic team would don PAPRs during the surgery, with the exception of the circulating nurse and operating theater attendant. Intraoperatively, the use of power instruments is avoided as much as is feasible without compromising the surgical exposure\u2014using rongeurs and chisels instead. We also avoid the use of nasal packing or pledgets, which will need to be removed in the postoperative phase, because removal may induce coughing or gagging.",

The safety of operating surgeons should be placed at the highest priority, although current resource limitation (or potential for such in the future) should also be taken into consideration to achieve a balance. Where possible, elective endonasal surgeries that are aerosol-generating should be deferred. For patients who do require urgent surgery, they should be assumed to be COVID-19\u2013positive until proven otherwise, and managed accordingly. In accordance with this, the minimum PPE worn should be an N95 mask with goggles and standard PPE, but we recommend the use of PAPRs (where feasible and available) for the surgical team due to their closest proximity to the patient (Figs. 1 and 2). This is to mitigate the low but possible risk of operating on asymptomatic COVID-19\u2013positive patients, which will increase as community prevalence increases, and in the absence of preoperative COVID-19 testing. For procedures in which headlight and loupes are required, alternative models of the PAPR such as the CleanSpace HALO may be used.",

One percent of blood specimens in a Chinese series contained detectable viral RNA.8 These considerations have wider implications for the rest of neurosurgery and other surgical specialties. Given finite resources, extensive testing and/or use of PPE will not be practical. All elective procedures should be postponed to minimize this theoretical risk as much as possible. Power drills should be irrigated more meticulously to minimize aerosolization.",
