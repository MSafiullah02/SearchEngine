These results support the fetal programming hypothesis, which suggests that maternal environment during gestation can influence progeny postnatal growth and health (Barker et al., 1993). Most studies concerning primiparous heifer prepartum nutrition focus on how nutritional treatments impact reproductive performance (Bellows et al., 1982, 2001; Wiley et al., 1991; Lammoglia et al., 1997; Patterson et al., 2003; Martin et al., 2005; Engel et al., 2008; Sullivan et al., 2009). However, a limited number of studies report the impact primiparous heifer nutrition during late gestation may have on subsequent progeny performance through weaning (Corah et al., 1975; Martin et al., 2005; Engel et al., 2008)",

Not meeting energy requirements of the dam can impact not only her productivity but the performance of subsequent offspring (Houghton et al., 1990; Dunn and Moss, 1992; Beaty et al., 1994; Wu et al., 2004; Hess et al., 2005; Underwood et al., 2010).

Calves born to cows grazing dormant winter range and receiving no supplement had reduced BW at approximately 7 mo of age compared with calves from cows receiving either 0.45 or 0.91 kg/d (32% CP, DM basis) of supplement during late gestation and grazing winter range or cows grazing corn residue. Conversely, Engel et al. (2008) reported no differences in weaning BW or ADG for calves born to DDGS- or soybean hull-fed primiparous heifers. Interestingly, there was no difference in heifer calf weaning BW based on maternal diet (P = 0.86). Martin et al. (2007) and Funston et al. (2010) reported an increase in heifer adjusted 205-d weaning BW and actual weaning BW, respectively, for heifers born to cows supplemented with a DDGS-based supplement during late gestation.

Bailey (2006) reported a 26-kg increase (P < 0.01) in BW at feedlot entry for steers compared with heifers. Additionally, steers had greater DMI, ADG, HCW, and LM area compared with heifers (Bailey, 2006). Previous data also indicate similar differences in steer and heifer performance as well as alterations in the efficiency in which they deposit tissue (Hedrick et al., 1969; Ray et al., 1969; Fox and Black, 1984; Brown and Lawrence, 2010; Long et al., 2010).",

Radunz (2009) reviewed the site-specific preferences for adipocytes. Subcutaneous adipocytes prefer acetate whereas intramuscular adipocytes prefer glucose as a substrate (Smith and Crouse, 1984; Rhoades et al., 2007). Furthermore, Radunz et al. (2012) suggested that increased marbling for calves born to hay-fed dams in late gestation results from increased insulin sensitivity during gestation for hay- compared with corn-fed cows, altering fetal adipocyte development and formation. Also, plasma insulin secretion has been correlated to carcass adiposity and insulin stimulates glucose uptake and lipogenesis in adipocytes (Trenkle and Topel, 1978; Radunz et al., 2009).",

Larson et al. (2009) reported a 19% increase in the proportion of steers grading USDA modest or greater for steers born to protein-supplemented dams compared with steers born to nonsupplemented dams. Similarly, Radunz (2009) reported that calves born to protein-supplemented cows had increased proportions grading USDA Choice or greater. However, Stalker et al.

            "text": "Data for economic analysis are summarized in Table 5. Maternal feed costs were reduced (P < 0.01) $27 and $24/cow for CON dams compared with LO and HI dams due to late gestation supplement costs. However, net return based on weaned calf value was not different (P = 0.23) among maternal treatments. Steer calves were valued $105 greater (P < 0.01) than heifer calves at weaning, resulting in an increased net return for steer calves if sold at weaning. Lack of statistical difference between treatments can be attributed to the tendency (P = 0.14) for calves from HI dams to be heavier at weaning compared to calves from CON dams. Feedlot purchase price tended to be greater (P = 0.07) for HI calves compared with CON calves due to the 16-kg difference (P = 0.03) in feedlot entry BW (Table 3). These data are similar to Larson et al. (2009), who also report an increase in feedlot purchase cost for calves born to protein supplemented dams. Feedlot costs are $10 and $11/calf greater (P = 0.01) for CON-born calves compared with HI- and LO-born calves, respectively. Increased costs are attributed to increased feed costs, which result from numerical increases in DMI reported in calves from CON dams (Table 3). Adjusted carcass value and net returns during the feedlot phase did not differ (P \u2265 0.82) based on maternal treatment. These data differ from both Stalker et al. (2006) and Larson et al. (2009), who reported increased net returns for calves retained from protein-supplemented cows. Whereas Stalker et al. (2006) reported negligible increases in net difference per steer ($0.65/animal), the authors do report an increase in net returns, which can be attributed to increased numbers of calves weaned from protein-supplemented dams (Stalker et al., 2006). Larson et al. (2009) reported a $47/steer increase in net returns for calves from protein-supplemented dams, attributed to an increased proportion of calves grading USDA Choice and increased HCW (Larson et al., 2009).",

            "text": "Findings in the current study differ from previously reported data for late gestation protein supplementation of multiparous cows. Studies conducted by Stalker et al. (2006, 2007), Martin et al. (2007), Larson et al. (2009), and Funston et al. (2010) used mature cows grazing winter range or corn residue, with maternal supplementation provided during late gestation. The stage of gestation in which supplementation occurred was similar to the time of supplementation in the current study. However, differences in calf performance and carcass characteristics could likely be related to control diet quality in those studies compared with the current study. The current study offered CON heifers ad libitum grass hay. As previously reported, this diet was not deficient in energy, MP, or RDP (Summers et al., 2015). Grazing cattle on dormant winter range does not meet the MP requirement for late gestating cattle; therefore, the nonsupplemented dams in the previous studies would have been in a negative energy balance, unlike CON heifers in the current study. It is possible that reducing CON heifer intake to create a negative nutrient balance, similar to that previously observed by our group in multiparous cow studies (Stalker et al., 2006, 2007; Larson et al., 2009; Funston et al., 2010), would result in a greater fetal programming effect. Although calves from HI dams had greater initial feedlot BW compared to calves from CON dams and feedlot production and carcass characteristics were impacted by maternal nutrition, then additional research is warranted to determine the effects differing RUP supplements may have on primiparous heifers grazing low quality forages during late gestation.",
