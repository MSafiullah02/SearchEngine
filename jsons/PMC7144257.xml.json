Up to the date of February 12, 2020, 189 medical teams consisting of 21 569 doctors and nurses from 29 provinces of China were sent to Hubei to deal with COVID-19 pneumonia [4]. The ongoing COVID-19 pneumonia pandemic is currently not under control, with a high risk of spread in China and globally. As of March 22, 2020, a total of 307 297 confirmed cases had been reported in at least 169 countries [5]. Unfortunately, the effect of the outbreak of COVID-19 pneumonia and ultimate scope is unclear so far as the situation is rapidly evolving [6, 7]. As a matter of fact, the fear of ongoing COVID-19 epidemic was and is playing a major role in the economic and social consequences.",

In another Wuhan cohort of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the overall mortality was 4.3% (6/138) [10]. The findings from these three previous studies suggested that older age and underlying comorbidities was associated with disease severity or death of COVID-19 pneumonia patients [8\u201310]. Between December 25, 2019 and February 7, 2020, a total of 179 adult patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were hospitalised to Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital, a special hospital for isolating and treating patients with infectious diseases. As of March 24, 2020, 158 patients had been discharged and the remaining 21 had died.

This was why the overall mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia in the special hospitals (11.1% in the cohort of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital [9] and 11.7% [95% CI, 7.0\u201216.5%] in our current cohort) seemed to be higher than that in the cohort of a general hospital (4.3%) [10].

In case of MERS, several inflammatory mediators, including inducible protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and interleukin-6 concentrations, are strongly associated with mortality [20]. Given that COVID-19 pneumonia is an emerging infectious disease, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes severe illness and fatal outcomes in humans are unknown. More recently, CD8+ T cells have been reported to be significantly decreased in peripheral blood in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [21]. It has been shown that several cytokines and chemokines, such as interleukin-2, interleukin-7, interleukin-10, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, inducible protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 concentrations were higher in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia than in those with mild disease, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection damages human immune system and results in systematic inflammatory response [8]. One important finding in our study was that CD3+CD8+ T cells, but not CD3+CD4+ T cells, in circulation were tremendously reduced in deceased patients compared to either the total survived population or those sex\u2012, age\u2012, and comorbid illness-matched controls. More importantly, CD3+CD8+ T cells \u226475 cell\u00b7\u03bcL\u22121, was a reliable predictor for mortality of patient with COVID-19 pneumonia. These data indicated that progressive immune-associated injury and inadequate adaptive immune responses could be possible mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes severe illness and fatal outcomes.",

As above mentioned, the overall death rate of COVID-19 pneumonia was 4% [17], and most deceased patients were older people with underlying illness [8\u201310]. For a younger cohort of 1716 Chinese medical staff whose age was always <65 years all over the country, 6 (0.3%) died [22]. These data suggest that the majority of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia would recover from the disease, especially younger people. Our current data demonstrated that patients in deceased group were susceptible to undergo multiple organ failure, especially heart failure and respiratory failure. One of the best laboratory parameters inflecting heart injury for predicting mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia was cardiac troponin I, and this parameter remained to be valid in the sex\u2012, age\u2012, and underlying illness\u2012matched control analysis. Our findings suggest that in the care of critical ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, protection strategy of vital organs should be emphasised for their survival. It should be noted that the elevation of cardiac troponin I in COVID-19 patients was just indicative of myocardial injury that was probably secondary to severe hypoxemia. For patients with positive cardiac troponin I result, what we could do was choosing appropriate respiratory support strategy to improve oxygenation and waiting for the recovery of myocardial damage.",
