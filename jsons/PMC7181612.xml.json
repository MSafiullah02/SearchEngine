These islands have diverse geological origins that have influenced the process of bat colonization and species distributions20. The ecological settings and species diversity on these islands for bats are notably different. On Madagascar, more than 45 bat species are known to occur, of which more than 80% are endemic to the island21\u201323. The smaller studied islands of the Western Indian Ocean, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion Island, and Mah\u00e9 (Seychelles), host reduced bat species diversity (e.g. three species on Reunion Island), whereas SECA supports a wide range of bat species. To date, several studies have identified bat-infecting CoVs in countries of continental Africa, including Zimbabwe24, South Africa25,26, Namibia27, and Kenya28,29. CoVs have also been reported in fruit bats (Pteropodidae) in Madagascar, where \u03b2-coronaviruses belonging to the D-subgroup were identified in Eidolon dupreanum and Pteropus rufus30.",

Specifically, 25 sequences were identified as \u03b1-CoVs, and three sequences were genetically related to the \u03b2-CoVs. For \u03b1-CoVs, all sequences detected in our tested Molossidae formed a highly supported monophyletic group, including CoV sequences from Molossidae bats previously detected in continental Africa (Fig. 4). CoVs detected in Mops condylurus (Mozambique), Mormopterus francoismoutoui (Reunion Island), Chaerephon pusillus and Chaerephon sp. (Mayotte), and Mormopterus jugularis (Madagascar) shared 90%\u201398% nucleotide similarity with a CoV detected in Chaerephon sp. in Kenya (Supplementary Table S2). All CoVs found in Miniopteridae clustered in a monophyletic group, including Miniopteridae CoVs sequences from Africa, Asia, and Oceania (Supplementary Table S2). The great majority of \u03b1-CoVs detected in Rhinolophidae bats clustered in two monophyletic groups (Fig. 3); one with African Rhinolophidae CoVs and one with Asian Rhinolophidae CoVs. We also detected one CoV from Rhinolophus rhodesiae, which was 100% similar to a Miniopteridae CoV from this study. Rhinonycteridae CoVs formed a single monophyletic group with NL63 Human CoVs. The Rhinonycteridae CoVs detected clustered with NL63-related bat sequences found in Triaenops afer in Kenya (Fig. 5) and showed 85% similarity to NL63 Human CoVs (Supplementary Table S2). Hipposideridae \u03b1-CoVs mainly clustered into a single monophyletic group, including 229E Human CoV-related bat sequence found in Hipposideros vittatus from Kenya (Fig. 6; Supplementary Table S2).",

The overall prevalence of CoV positive bats was consistent with studies from continental Africa25 and from islands in the Australasian region31, although we detected significant variation in the prevalence of infected bats, according to their family, species, sampling location and season. Our study is nevertheless affected by the strong heterogeneity of bat communities in the island of the Western Indian Ocean, in particular in term of species richness. The high CoV genetic diversity detected in bats from Mozambique and Madagascar is likely to be associated with the higher bat species diversity in the African mainland and in Madagascar, has compared to small oceanic islands20. In addition, CoV prevalence in bat populations may significantly vary across seasons, as found in Mozambique with higher prevalence during the wet season than in the dry season. Several studies on bat CoV have indeed shown significant variations in the temporal infection dynamic of CoV in bats, potentially associated with bat parturition32\u201334.",

Congruence between host and viral phylogenies however suggests a strong signal for co-evolution between Western Indian Ocean bats and their associated CoVs.

For example, in Mozambique, we found a potential Miniopteridae \u03b1-CoV in a Rhinolophidae bat co-roosting with Miniopteridae in the same cave. These host-switching events could be favored when several bat species roost in syntopy40. A similar scenario was described in Australia where Miniopteridae \u03b1-CoV was detected in Rhinolophidae bats31. These infrequent host-switching events show that spillovers can happen but suggest that viral transmission is not maintained in the receiver host species. The host-virus co-evolution might thus have resulted in strong adaptation of CoVs to each bat host species. In addition, viral factors (mutation rate, recombination propensity, replication ability in the cytoplasm, changes in the ability to bind host cells), environmental factors (climate variation, habitat degradation, decrease of bat preys), and phylogenetic relatedness of host species are also critical for the viral establishment in a novel host41\u201344. Nevertheless, apparent evidence of host switching as a dominant mechanism of CoV evolution could be an artifact of a lack of data for some potential bat hosts, leading to incomplete phylogenetic reconstructions38.",

These two human viruses are widely distributed in the world and associated with mild to moderate respiratory infection in humans45. Tao et al. established that the NL63 Human CoVs and 229E Human CoVs have a zoonotic recombinant origin from their most recent common ancestor, estimated to be about 1,000 years ago46. During the past decade, they were both detected in bats in Kenya, and in Ghana, Gabon, Kenya, and Zimbabwe, respectively24,28,47,48. Intermediate hosts are important in the spillover of CoVs, despite major knowledge gaps on the transmission routes of bat infectious agents to secondary hosts49. This hypothesis has been formulated for the 229E Human CoV, with an evolutionary origin in Hipposideridae bats and with camelids as intermediate hosts48. The ancient spillover of NL63 from Rhinonycteridae bats to humans might have occurred through a currently unidentified intermediate host28,50,51. Because receptor recognition by viruses is the first essential cellular step to infect host cells, CoVs may have spilt over into humans from bats through an intermediate host possibly due to mutations on spike genes13,28. Further investigations of CoVs in Kenyan and Mozambican livestock and hunted animals could potentially provide information on the complete evolutionary and emergence history of these two viruses before their establishment in humans.",

As for most emerging zoonoses, CoV spillover and emergence may be associated to human activities and ecosystem changes such as habitat fragmentation, agricultural intensification and bushmeat consumption. The role of bats as epidemiological reservoir of infectious agents needs to be balanced with such human driven modifications on ecosystem functioning, in order to properly assess bat-borne CoV emergence risks.",
