            "text": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a global health problem, which often leads to severe consequences such as liver failure, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There are about 2 billion people who have been infected with HBV, and more than 350 million people are lifelong patients [1], [2], [3]. Immunization therapy is the most effective measure for new infections, but millions of the HBV patients will eventually succumb to the infection sequence due to vaccine failure [4]. Interferon-\u03b1 and polyethylene glycol interferon-\u03b1 are used as anti-HBV agents clinically, however, their application is limited for low curing rate and serious side effects (influenza-like symptoms, fatigue, myalgia, nausea, headache, etc.) [5], [6]. Five nucleoside drugs, lamivudine (3TC), adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), entecavir (ETV), telbivudine (LdT) and tenofovir-DF (TDF), have been approved by FDA for HBV treatment. The disadvantages of nucleosides, such as drug resistance and high recurrence, are becoming an important clinical issue because of the single target [6], [7], [8]. New strategies aiming at viral suppression, promoting virologic clearance and preventing drug resistance are fascinating topics [9]. Therefore, novel anti-HBV agents with unique antiviral target and mechanism are still needed.",

For example, helioxanthin, initially isolated from the shrub of Taiwania cryptomerioides, had unique mechanisms by diminishing HBV promoter activity and blocking viral gene expression and replication. After chemical modification, its more active derivative 8\u20131 (Fig. 1\n) was obtained [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Oxymatrine (Fig. 1) and its derivatives showed anti-HBV activity through suppressing host heat-stress cognate 70 (Hsc70) expression [18]. In our previous study, alisol A from Alisma orientalis possessed potent anti-HBV activity, and a series of high-activity derivatives were obtained (Fig. 1) after chemical modification [19], [20], [21].",

For example, cinnamic acid (2, Fig. 2) could inhibit HIV/SARS-CoV S pseudovirus [33], and the cholesteryl conjugated with the 3, 4-dimethoxy cimmamic acid (3, Fig. 2) could enhance the anti-poliovirus type 1 (PV1) activity [44]. Caffeic acid (3, 4-dihydroxycinnamic acid, 4, Fig. 2) and chlorogenic acid (the ester of 3, 4-dihydroxycinnamic acid with quinic acid, 5, Fig. 2) showed potent anti-HBV activity in vivo and in vitro\n[45], which suggested that the molecular with cinnamic acid moiety might show potent anti-HBV activity. Meanwhile, cinnamic acid has been widely applied as a food additive with good safety [46].",

Compound 18 mainly inhibited 5.6 times of the transcript activity of HBV X promoter (Xp) and increased 9.4 times of the HBV enhancer ENI compared with mock-treated control. HBV sequences are transcribed under the control of promoters and enhancers which are important for replication of HBV [51], [52]. The Xp regulates transcription of the small 0.9 kb mRNA sequence encoding HBV X protein (HBx), which plays an important role in stimulating HBV transcription and replication [53], [54]. The HBV ENI element takes a crucial effect in the overall liver-specific regulation of HBV gene expression [55]. Thus, compound 18 might exert anti-HBV activity by interfering promoters and enhancers to influence HBV transcriptions. Considering that there are about 20 nucleotides overlapped between the minimal Xp sequence and the 3\u2032 end of the ENI [56], [57], [58], compound 18 was presumed to simultaneously influence Xp and ENI on the overlapped region. Further studies are needed to clarify how compound 18 takes effect and which region responds exactly.",

Most of the derivatives displayed potent anti-HBV activity especially inhibited the HBV DNA replication with the IC50 values from 2.44 to 22.89 \u03bc\u039c. The most active compound 18 inhibited not only the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg with IC50 values of 5.52 \u03bc\u039c (SI > 330.0) and 5.52 \u03bc\u039c (SI > 330.0), but also the HBV DNA replication with IC50 value of 2.44 \u03bc\u039c (SI > 746.6). Preliminary mechanism study proposed that compound 18 exerted antivirus effects via interfering HBV promoters and enhancers to influence HBV transcriptions. The low cytotoxicity and acute toxicity in mice indicated that compound 18 may be potential novel non-nucleoside anti-HBV drug candidate with unique mechanisms to be further investigated.",

The anti-HBV activities and cytotoxicity of compounds 1, 6\u201351 were evaluated on the Hep G 2.2.15 cell line. The anti-HBV antigen secretion activities were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Autobio Diagnostics Co., Ltd, China). For detection of HBV DNA, a real-time PCR assay was used. Briefly, 10 \u03bcL of DNA sample was amplified in a 25 \u03bcL mixture containing 2 \u00d7 SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 2 primers specific for HBV: a forward primer (HBV-t1: 5-CAA GGA ACC TCT ATG TAT CCC TCC-3) and reverse primer (HBV-t2: 5-TCC GTC CGA AGG TTT GGT AC-3) covering the 50\u2013base pair insertion from 541 bp to 591 bp. Cytotoxicity was assayed with a modified 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method (Gibco Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All the compounds were dissolved in DMSO (Gibco; solvent control) for the anti-HBV activity and cytotoxicity assays. The concentration of DMSO in the culture was kept below 2.5 \u03bcL/mL to ensure that the growth of the cells was not affected. An antiviral agent, tenofovir (Jiangxi Chenyang Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd, China) was used as a positive control.",
