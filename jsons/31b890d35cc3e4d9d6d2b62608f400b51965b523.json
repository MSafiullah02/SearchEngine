It is challenging to estimate global research and development expenditures and compare those results across countries. The two major issues are obtaining health care data from each country and using a common currency conversion over time (Young et al, 2015) . Despite these important challenges, Chakma et al (2014) made a legitimate effort to do just that, sourcing data from global biomedical agencies, governments and statistical bureaus and rendering those data into US dollars for legitimate comparisons. According to this analysis, in 2012 the USA spent the most on health care research, amounting to US $48.9 billion by public institutions and US $70.4 billion by private industry. The whole of Europe spent US $81.8 billion. All of the countries in Asia-Oceania spent half the amount of the biomedical research increased at a faster pace in Asia-Oceania than in the United States as well as Canada and Europe. In accord with this rising biomedical investment, psychoneuroimmunology research is now growing in the entire Asia-Pacific region.",

There was an increase in competition among countries for recruiting and retaining the best biomedical research talent. This increase in health spending meant more opportunities for Asian-Oceanian scientists to return home to their native country to work and prosper. And, after they returned, many developed productive collaborative research programs with Western scientists where they received their advanced training. It also meant that graduate students, post-docs and professors from countries outside of Asian-Oceania had more employment opportunities in foreign countries. Stated simply, increased funding for biomedical R&D in Asia increased opportunities not only for Asian-Pacific investigators but for scientists around the entire world. The end product has been simply the result of supply and demand. The beneficiaries of this greater investment in biomedical R&D in the entire Asia-Pacific region were not only the investigators but all of us because of the biomedical discoveries that they produced.",

This development challenges two key features of biomedical research: openness in sharing data and global collaboration. And, this umbrage might spread to all countries in Asia-Oceania. As highlighted by the current pandemic with SARS-CoV-2, this is a time when biomedical scientists and pharmaceutical companies around the world are working together to find both treatments and a vaccine for this very contagious coronavirus (Apuzzo and Kirkpatrick, 2020) . Indeed, the former director of the National Institutes of Health, Elias Zerhouni, pointed to the substantial contributions of foreign-national scientists. He noted that foreign nationals have contributed greatly to both patents and scientific discoveries in the USA. He wrote, \"No members of any community should be targeted because of their origins\u2026.The United States should not risk losing critical intellectual assets such as productive foreign-born scientists and engineers to global competitors\u2026\" (Zerhouni, 2019) . This cautionary message was more recently reiterated by the editorial staff of the leading journal, Biological Psychiatry: \"The mission of Biological Psychiatry is to publish impactful scientific communications. To further that mission, we promote diversity in all aspects of the publication process, including authorship, reviewing, and editing. Our diversity efforts aim to increase participation among individuals of underrepresented racial, ethnic, and gender identities; from underrepresented countries or disadvantaged backgrounds; and those with disabilities.\" (Leibenluft, 2020) .",

However, as noted above, that focus changed dramatically early in the 21st century. The Psychoneuroimmunology Research Society (PNIRS) is a global nonprofit society that was formed in 1993. Its primary goal is to promote the study of interactions between the nervous and immune systems and the relationship between behavior and health. PNIRS has a rich history of promoting basic research that can be translated to the clinic (Kelley and McCusker, 2014; Kelley, 2020) , and this extends to Asia. As early as 2002, Christopher Coe, Ph.D., organized a symposium at the annual PNIRS meeting that was held in Madison, Wisconsin. The speakers discussed both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Tai chi (Anonymous, 2002) . Ten years later, the society \"got ahead of the curve\" by recognizing the growing importance of biomedical research in China by forming the Chinese branch of PNIRS, designated PNIRS China , as its official regional affiliate in that country. This PNIRS China affiliate began by serendipity.",

As such, she recommended that Professor Peng invite the then Editor-in-Chief of Brain, Behavior, and Immunity. Professor Kelley readily accepted the ensuing invitation from Professor Peng to lecture in Nantong. He went on to lecture in Dalian and Beijing. During that trip, lots of brainstorming occurred about the idea of forming liaisons between China, Brain, Behavior, and Immunity and PNIRS (Fig. 1 ). The possibility of creating an Eastern affiliate like PNIRS China , as had previously been done in the West with Germany (German-Endocrine-Brain-Immune-Network (GEBIN; Anonymous, 1997) , was considered.",

The practice of TCM has been, and continues to be, used by billions of people in the Sinosphere. The K.W. Kelley, et al. Brain, Behavior, and Immunity xxx (xxxx) xxx-xxx essence of TCM is the balance of body and mind (Fig. 2) , which is considered to be linked by communication between the brain, neuroendocrine and immune systems. Professor Cobol Su, M.D., Ph.D., at the China Medical University in Taiwan recently eloquently summarized this concept with a simple sentence: \"Psychoneuroimmunology has been long stemmed in ancient medicine (Su, 2019) .\" As such, it seemed logical to develop a plan that would establish more formal relationships with Chinese scientists. This would not only promote a better understanding of psychoneuroimmunology but also serve to contribute to improvement of world-wide health care. Furthermore, sharing Western science with Chinese investigators made sense in order to articulate and better understand if and how TCM aligns with Western scientific principles (Anonymous, 2007) . Perhaps the PNIRS affiliate of China would promote development of knowledge about mind-body techniques practiced in other Eastern countries like Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. A summary of these discussions was shared with the President of the PNIRS at that time, Professor Manfred Schedlowski in Essen, Germany. Following discussions of these and other ideas with the PNIRS Executive officers, Professor Schedlowski formally recognized this affiliation on November 26, 2012, in a letter to Quentin Liu, M.D., Ph.D., stating: \"Please accept this letter as an official formal acceptance and recognition of the regional network of Chinese scientists/physicians engaged in research of direct interest to the PNIRS and its official scientific journal, Brain, Behavior, and Immunity. Your China Branch of PNIRS (PNIRS China ) will be recognized as an official regional affiliate of PNIRS.\" (Fig. 3) . Professor Schedlowski hoped that creation of the regional affiliate of PNIRS China would someday permit PNIRS to enjoy its first annual meeting in China.",

            "text": "In 2013, Professor Quentin Liu was (and remains) Vice-president of Dalian Medical University and Director of their Institute of Cancer Stem Cells. Dalian Medical University was one of the first universities in China to focus on Clinical Integrative Medicine. This is a curriculum that combines teaching, practice and research in both traditional and western medicine. Following creation of PNIRS China , Professor Liu moved quickly to establish and organize the first official meeting of this new PNIRS affiliate (Anonymous, 2016) . The participating organizations were Dalian Medical University, Nantong University, Jining Medical University and Sun Yat-sen University. Importantly, Professor Liu enlisted the input of Bo Bai, M.D., Ph.D., the president of Jining Medical University. This academic forum was held in conjunction with the Dalian Psychoneuroimmunology Medical Society. A broad goal was developed that aimed to embrace, learn and share knowledge about psychoneuroimmunology with Chinese colleagues. At the opening ceremony of the first PNIRS China meeting on April 23, 2013, Professor Liu outlined three specific goals for the new PNIRS affiliate: (1) Conduct basic research that can be translated into clinically relevant health applications; (2) Promote the growth of interrelationships among scientists of different scientific and medical disciplines; and (3) Build a platform of academic communication for researchers engaged in psychoneuroimmunology research and teaching. The PNIRS China affiliate would help scientists in China develop an international perspective, to identify and cultivate emerging outstanding young investigators and organize academic forums and experience exchanges among laboratories. Professor Kelley, other scientists and university leaders made presentations during the ceremony. This 2013 meeting was well-attended with 250 registrants. Professor Liu formally presented Professor Kelley with a plaque recognizing the formal creation of PNIRS China (Fig. 4) . Professor Liu extended the opening of PNIRS China by organizing meetings at Jining Medical University and Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou. The integrative aspects of psychoneuroimmunology research were emphasized at all these meetings. Indeed, the call for expanding the knowledge of integrative medicine in continuing medical education programs, as assessed by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education, has recently been highlighted (Ring et al., 2020) .",

Oceania countries are plentiful, including Australia and its territories, New Zealand, and all the islands of Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia. The idea of expanding the presence of PNIRSAsia was presented to the PNIRS Board of Directors. In 2017, they agreed to this proposal and changed the official name of PNIRS China to PNIRS Asia-Pacific (Anonymous, 2017) . The charge was to expand the successful activities of PNIRS China to other countries in Asia-Oceania. Since then, the PNIRS Asia-Pacific affiliate has sponsored nine successful symposia at meetings of scientific societies outside mainland China. These included Taiwan, Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand (Fig. 5 ). At the end of 2019, 69 expert scientists had participated in the 13 official meetings of the PNIRS Asia-Pacific affiliate. Gender of the speakers was equivalent, and all of these scholars generally paid their entire travel expenses.

Increasing evidence has established that immune disorders are involved in many nervous system diseases and that neuroregulatory abnormalities can result in immune dysfunction. Today, more and more Chinese scientists recognize the significance of neuroimmunology and psychoneuroimmunology research in human health and disease therapy and are being attracted to this research field. The establishment of PNIRS China in 2013 was a hallmark development that is already rapidly promoting psychoneuroimmunology research in China. By using data from the official scientific journal of PNIRS, this fact is made clear (Fig. 7A ). Prior to 2016, there were fewer than 100 papers per year submitted to Brain, Behavior, and Immunity. Now, research papers submitted by mainland scientists to this journal amount to nearly 400 per year. More importantly, the quality of these papers has increased substantially, as assessed by the rapid rise in scientific citations. It is also clear that during the past five years, Chinese scientists have greatly increased their collaborative research efforts with laboratories outside of the mainland, which now includes the United States, all of Europe and Australia (Fig. 7B) .",

            "text": "During this decade, most studies on psychoneuroimmunology in China have focused on interactions between immune disorders mediated by microglia and nervous system diseases. Excessive microglial activation is involved in the pathogenesis of many mental health and central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including stress, depression, ischemic or traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases. In turn, psychological and CNS disorders often cause microglial activation. Inhibition of microglial excessive activation or promotion of microglial polarization from an M1-like towards an M2-like phenotype may help to alleviate some of these disorders. Several relevant studies from China on these topics have been published in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity.",

Nitidine, a benzophenanthridine alkaloid, restricts reactive microgliosis and promotes CNS repair following traumatic injury (Yuan et al., 2015) . Suppression of microglial activation by let-7c-5p overexpression is neuroprotective and ameliorates ischemic damage (Ni et al., 2015) . Specific deletion of the protein kinase MST1 in microglia mitigates stroke-induced brain injury (Zhao et al., 2016) . 3. Microglia and neurodegenerative diseases. TREM2 promotes microglial polarization from an M1-like towards an M2-like phenotype and thereby reduces neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease and ameliorates its development . Trans-cinnamaldehyde, a primary bioactive component derived from the stem bark of Cinnamomum cassia, suppresses neuroinflammatory responses by diminishing microglial activation and levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. This reduces memory deficits in mice with Alzheimer's disease (Zhao et al., 2019) . Gut microbial dysbiosis is involved in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis, and fecal microbiota transplantation can protect affected mice by suppressing neuroinflammation and reducing TLR4/TNF-\u03b1 signaling in microglia (Sun et al., 2018) . Galectin-1 reduces neurodegeneration in a Parkinson's disease model by modulating the microglial MAPK/I\u03baB/NF\u03baB axis (Li et al., 2020) . It is important to note that the triptolide (T10), a Chinese herb, protects against neurotoxicity in Parkinson's disease by inhibiting microglial activation with metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 mediating its effect . Thus, as was highlighted by Nobel Laurate Professor Tu Youyou, exploring more Chinese herbs and their mechanisms underlying suppression of microglial activation provide an opportunity for Chinese scientists to develop novel therapeutic strategies for targeted psychological and CNS diseases.",

T cells also infiltrate the spinal cord with an imbalance of Th17/Treg towards Th17 during the development of bone cancer pain. In turn, this promotes microglial activation and further increases pain, while neutralizing IL-17/IL-17A in the spinal cord ameliorates bone cancer pain (Huo et al., 2019) . In addition to the Th17/Treg imbalance, a Th1/Th2 imbalance also occurs in the brain and peripheral blood following cerebral ischemia (Niu et al., 2012) . The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 derived from Th2 cells may alleviate neuropathic pain and contribute to other neuropsychiatric disorders (Nie et al., 2018) .

Indeed, psychopathology manifestations are sensitive to cultural influences (Guinart et al, 2019) . Furthermore, immunological status is arguably different regarding significant backgrounds of genomic constitution, dietary patterns and life styles. It is therefore strongly urged that more exploratory, rather than replicated, translational brain research from the East be valued and promoted.

The very first edition of Brain, Behavior, and Immunity, published in 1987 carried an article by Professor Kusnecov and colleagues, which has since been cited 64 times. In this work, the authors revealed a role for \u03b2-endorphin in enhancing lymphocyte reactivity to concanavalin A (Kusnecov et al, 1987) . At that time, publications in the journal were dominated by laboratories from the United States (5 articles of the 10 in the first issue). Since then, psychoneuroimmunology research in Australia has gone from strength to strength (Fig. 8A) , with a particular boost in 2017 when the PNIRS China initiative was broadened to encompass the rest of Asia and the Pacific. Australians now have the 6th most submissions to Brain, Behavior, and Immunity annually, after the United States, China, Brazil, Germany and the United Kingdom (data for 2017 courtesy of Elsevier). These publications are at least as high quality and impactful as those from other countries. The most recent data published in Nature Index noted that between 2017 and 2018, contributions of Australian scientists to the highest quality journals in the life sciences increased by 8.2% (Anonymous, 2020) . Australia now contributes approximately the fourth most published articles in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity (after the United States, China, United Kingdom and equal to Canada). In 2019, 16 papers were published in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity with Australian first or senior authors. An additional four had Australian collaborators and at least ten employed diverse internationally collaborative research teams. Importantly, many of those articles are examples of the truly global nature of current psychoneuroimmunology research. Several featured upwards of five nations in the author list, integrating technologies, ideas, personnel and student experiences towards research outcomes that could not be achieved by one group alone (Fig. 8B) . These papers covered such diverse research topics as chlamydia and Alzheimer's disease (Woods et al, 2020) to microglial morphology in post-traumatic stress disorder (Smith et al., 2019) to aging and traumatic brain injury .",

As of 2019, there are two Australian Associate Editors at Brain, Behavior, and Immunity (as well as one from Taiwan). In 2019, PNIRS elected its first Australian president, Professor Deborah Hodgson. Around 10% of the PNIRS membership is Australian. The few years since the 2017 incorporation of Australia along with the rest of Asia and the Pacific region into the PNIRS Asia-Pacific affiliation have also witnessed an explosion of internationally collaborative meetings and symposia showcasing Australian psychoneuroimmunology research. Professor Mark Hutchinson organized a symposium in Sydney in 2014. Three years later, Professor Hutchinson teamed with Dr. Luba Sominsky to organize a psychoneuroimmunology satellite workshop to Australia's premiere neuroscience meeting, the Australasian Neuroscience Conference. The 2019 International Brain Research Organization showcased key Australian elements of the PNIRS Asia-Pacific initiative, along with Professor Suzi Hong from the Pacific side of the United States at their meeting in Daegu, South Korea. In 2019, there was also a PNIRS Asia-Pacific symposium integrated into the Queenstown Winter Conference on Brain Research week in Queenstown, New Zealand. This symposium highlighted research from investigators with experience from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States and amply illustrates how far the PNIRS has now come as a global scientific community.",

However, we also expect to see psychoneuroimmunology research becoming more specialized to embrace the specific psychoneuroimmunology needs of different international communities. For instance, the psychoneuroimmunology consequences of endemic diseases like malaria or dengue might be of key relevance for South-East Asia. China may benefit from an individualized response to novel coronaviruses. Australia and the United States are now investing heavily in space exploration, making psychoneuroimmunology research important in this context for these countries. Air pollution may have important psychoneuroimmunology implications all over the world, but the types of pollution may differ. On the other hand, historically different approaches to our understanding of psychoneuroimmunology among different communities worldwide may bring important advances to all of us. The holistic integration of body and mind that is the cornerstone of traditional medicine in China is revolutionizing Western medicine and popular approaches. Likewise, the strong social support networks of indigenous communities have key implications for stress and mental health management for everyone. Thus, globalizing psychoneuroimmunology research does not just mean more of the same in new countries, but a true advance in our approach to understanding how the world we live in affects our brains and bodies.",

This placed Japan as the 13th country in the world with the highest number of publications in the journal. In addition, there were 231 Japanese authors that contributed to papers. The number of Japanese members in PNIRS is only four at the present time. Although these data might make it appear as though Japanese investigators do not have a strong interest in psychoneuroimmunology, a growing number of Japanese scientists are performing research related to this field. The Japanese Society for Neuroimmunology was established in 1988 by physicians who specialize in intractable neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and the paraneoplastic syndrome. These physicians are interested not only in clinical treatments, but also in the basic mechanisms underlying the interactions between the nervous and immune systems. When PNIRS Asia-Pacific organized a symposium for the first time in Japan at the 2019 annual meeting of the Japan Neuroscience Society, the Japanese Society for Neuroimmunology published a record of this symposium in its official journal (Shimada, 2020; Pal et al., 2020; Kelley and Shimada, 2020) . Collaborations between the executive board members of the society and PNIRS Asia-Pacific are currently in the works, and the Japanese Society for Neuroimmunology and PNIRS Asia-Pacific hope to hold joint symposia in the near future. In addition, the National Institute of Neuroscience at the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry has one of the most active laboratories that perform research related to neuroimmunology and neuroinflammation (Yamamura et al, 2019) .",

            "text": "In the history of modern immunology, Japanese immunologists have made outstanding achievements using molecular biological techniques to elucidate the fundamental principles of immunology. The most recent example is from the famous laboratory of Tadamitsu Kishimoto, M.D., from Osaka University. His life work led to development of a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor (Kishimoto, 2005) . This antibody, known as tocilizumab, is used for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Because of its immunosuppressive properties that inhibit the cytokine storm, it has recently been approved for late stage clinical trials in both China and the USA as treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Professor Susumu Tonegawa was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1987 for his work showing that genetic material rearranges itself to form millions of different antibodies (Tonegawa, 1983) . His discovery revealed the mechanism of the adaptive immune system, which had been the central question of immunology for over 100 years. Professor Tasuku Honjo established the basic conceptual framework of class switch recombination through his discovery of DNA deletion (Honjo and Kataoka, 1978) and activationinduced cytidine deaminase (AID) (Muramatsu et al, 2000) . Other leading Japanese immunologists have also contributed to the identification of cytokines, their receptors and signaling pathways, including interferon \u03b1, interferon \u03b2, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-18, IL-8/ CXCL8, CXCL12, CXCR4, Fas receptor and Fas ligand (Kumanogoh and Ogata, 2000 for a review). The contributions of Japanese research to the field of innate immunity include identification of ligands for most of the Toll-like receptors (Akira and Takeda, 2004) . Professor Honjo was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2018 for his discovery of program cell death 1 (PD-1), a negative co-receptor of the effector phase of the immune response. Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy is now approved in the United States, European Union and Japan, and it has revolutionized the treatments for cancer (Chowdhury et al, 2018) . PD-1 could also be a novel key molecule in psychoneuroimmunology. Augmented T cell responses in Pdcd1\u2212/\u2212 mice, which lack the inhibitory receptor PD-1, induce a systemic decrease in tryptophan and tyrosine levels. This leads to a substantial deficiency in brain serotonin and dopamine, resulting in anxiety-like behavior and exacerbated fear responses (Miyajima et al, 2017) .",

It is therefore an opportune time for the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of Japan to launch a new grant program starting in fiscal year 2020 under the name of \"Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas.\" This new grant program aims to promote the creation of novel research areas by young investigators through co-creative and interdisciplinary efforts between researchers in diverse fields that will lead to radical transformation and changes in the existing framework of academic disciplines. Through these efforts, Japanese scientists of new generations will make significant contributions to the emerging field of psychoneuroimmunology.",

By all accounts, in less than 10 years, this PNIRS affiliate has been very successful in bridging the gap between Eastern and Western scientists interested in psychoneuroimmunology research. This advance is evidenced by the rapid growth in both the number and citations to high-quality manuscripts published in Brain, Behavior, and Immunity by countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Beginning in 2019, the PNIRS Asia-Pacific committee furthered global collaboration in this field with the creation of a program that promotes scientific exchanges of faculty, post-docs and graduate students between laboratories in the East and West: PNIRS Asia-Pacific Global Research Connections. Biomedical research today is a global enterprise that is becoming more and more integrative in nature. Age-old practices from the East, including meditation/mindfulness, exercise and dietary interventions, are now becoming accepted in the West. It is the continuing goal of the PNIRS Asia-Pacific affiliate to promote crosstalk between biomedical scientists in the East and West.",
