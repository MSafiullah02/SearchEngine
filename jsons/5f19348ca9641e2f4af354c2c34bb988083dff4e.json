In fact, physicians should not overlook other clinical symptoms in the shadow of COVID-19. Another new clinical experience was that CRP might be negative in patients with COVID-19. Therefore, CRP is not a sensitive marker in this condition. Late referral of patients can increase mortality rate while those who timely visited the hospital had better response to treatment. Finally, many subjects had actually negative results for COVID-19, but they had fear of the virus indicating an exaggerated rate of panic of the disease.",
