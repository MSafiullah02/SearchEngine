Among these three main classes, the known or putative metallopeptidases are more consistently represented across species varying from 105, for example, in Trypanosoma cruzi to 164 in mouse (and 161 in the human) (Table 19 .1). The other two classes exhibit a greater diversity ranging in the number of genes for cysteine proteases from 26 in T. cruzi to 162 in mouse (and 160 in the human). For the serine peptidases this distribution is even more pronounced: from 14 in T. cruzi to 245 in mouse (210 in human). There are a smaller number of aspartic peptidases although some are of key therapeutic importance (e.g. the b-and a-secretases implicated in Alzheimer pathology) and even less variety in the number of threonine peptidases. This greater consistency of representation of metallopeptidases across species probably reflects more generic cellular functions and their distinctive catalytic mechanisms which require a water molecule activated by a divalent metal ion, commonly zinc.",

            "text": "The complete repertoire of peptidases expressed by a tissue or organism is now referred to as the \"protein degradome,\" a concept originally introduced by Lopez-Otin and colleagues (Cal et al. 2003) . Comparative analysis of mammalian degradomes has revealed that rodents generally have a more complex combination of peptidases compared with primates, mainly due to the expansion of peptidase families involved in reproduction and host defence (Puente et al. 2005) . These authors also found several genes implicated in reproduction, nutrition and the immune system, which are functional in rat, mouse or chimpanzee, but have been inactivated by mutations in the human lineage. These findings suggested that conversion of specific peptidase genes into pseudogenes has contributed to the evolution of the human genome. A recent example of this \"pseudogenisation\" is found in the ACE3 gene in the human (Rella et al. 2007 ). Approx one-quarter of the 80 or so human inherited diseases caused by mutations in protease-coding genes (http://www. uniovi.es/degradome/) are linked to metallopeptidases (see Table 19 .2). Abnormal functioning of these genes is implicated in such diverse pathologies as inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and neurodegeneration. Understanding the normal roles of these enzymes and their homologues is important for the design of novel and selective therapeutics. Animal venoms are a natural source of a wide range of metallopeptidases which have biological implications (Moura-da-Silva et al. 2007) and some bacterial toxins (e.g. botulinum, tetanus) exert their toxic actions as metalloproteases, in their case by blocking neurotransmitter release by proteolysis of synaptobrevin (Schiavo et al. 1992 ).

            "text": "Organisms use proteolysis for a wide range of purposes. They include complete protein digestion of dietary proteins as a source of amino acids by the digestive proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin), degradation of structural components e.g. extracellular matrix by the matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), intracellular protein turnover important in post-mitotic cells to prevent accumulation of malfunctioning proteins (lysosome, ubiquitin-proteasome system) including partial digestion of external antigens in immune surveillance, degradation of cyclins at different stages of the cell cycle, conversion of precursor-proteins into their final biologically active structures (zymogens, pro-enzymes, prohormones, other cryptic peptides) and ectodomain shedding to initiate or modulate cell signalling. Highly specific proteolysis can regulate G protein receptor signalling (proteinase-activated receptors) (Bunnett 2006) , and nuclear transcriptional events through regulated intramembrane proteolysis (Wolfe 2009 ). This chapter will predominantly focus on processing events that utilise metalloproteases, and their physiological and pathological consequences. The process of protein biosynthesis itself involves proteolytic processing: the removal of initiator methionine, signal peptide, cell localization signal and propeptide, where present. A primary mechanism in post-translational modifications of proteins is hence the co-translational removal of the N-terminal methionine from a nascent protein, a process which ultimately determines the half-life of a protein by exposing a new N-terminal residue, as originally proposed by Varshavsky and colleagues (the N-end rule) (Bachmair et al. 1986 ). Proteins retaining the initiator methionine have shorter half-lives (Frottin et al. 2006 ). This has led to the definition of specific protein degradation signals or \"degrons\" that can allow rapid degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system in eukaryotes and the ClpAP protease in bacteria (Ravid and Hochstrasser 2008; Mogk et al. 2007 ). The initiating step, the methionine removal, is catalysed by methionyl aminopeptidases (MetAP) and, although the eukaryotic MetAP was originally thought to be cobalt-dependent, it is likely that the physiologically relevant cation for this enzyme is zinc (Bradshaw et al. 2004; Leopoldini et al. 2007 ). Methionine removal subsequently followed by modification of the N-terminal residue is often crucial for the function, or dysfunction, of a protein. In this context, the posttranslational conversion of an N-terminal glutamate to a cyclized form (pyroglutamyl) is relatively common and is catalysed by the zinc metalloenzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC) (Huang et al. 2005) . This can modify, among other substrates, the Alzheimer's amyloid-b (Ab) peptide rendering it more hydrophobic with a greater propensity to aggregation (Cynis et al. 2008) . Small molecule inhibitors of QC may provide novel therapeutics in the treatment of AD (Schilling et al. 2008 ) and see below (Sect. 19.7).",

They are also subdivided into distinct classes and in the human genome practically all classes are present. In this chapter we shall focus on zinc metallopeptidase families belonging to one of these clans, namely MA, since these are principally involved in the cell-surface or extracellular post-translational modifications of proteins and peptides. Representatives of this clan require zinc for their activity and are often referred to as \"zincins.\" They contain histidine residues as zinc ligands in the typical zinc binding motif, His-Glu-Xaa-Xaa-His (HEXXH). They are further sub-divided according to the nature of the third zinc ligand: gluzincins use a glutamyl residue which lies 18-72 amino acids C-terminal to the HEXXH motif; metzincins use a His or Asp within an extended zinc motif HEXXHXXGXXH/D. They are termed metzincins because of a strictly conserved methionine-containing turn (the Met-turn) in their structure which is thought to provide a hydrophobic base at the zinc-binding site (St\u00f6cker et al. 1995) .",

A key function for this enzyme is in \"trimming\" proteasome-produced peptides for class I antigen presentation and it is upregulated by cytokines, e.g. g-interferon (Beninga et al. 1998) . Another example of key pathophysiological significance is the type II membrane glycoprotein, glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII; NAALADase), which has two distinct roles: in the brain it inactivates the neuropeptide N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate by cleaving off the a-linked glutamate whereas in the intestine it sequentially releases g-linked glutamates from folyl-poly-g-glutamates (folate hydrolase activity). It is also identical with the prostate cancer marker PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen), which is highly expressed in aggressive prostate tumours and which might provide a target for immunological or other therapeutic approaches to the disease (Els\u00e4sser-Beile et al. 2009 ). The recent structural solution of a catalytically inactive mutant (E424A) of GCPII in complex with its substrate (N-Ac-Asp-Glu) has, for the first time, revealed the detailed reaction mechanism for this dual zinc-containing metallopeptidase (Klus\u00e1k et al. 2009 ).",

Arguably, ACE is better termed peptidyl-dipeptidase-A because, as a carboxydipeptidase, it has a number of important substrates and functions in addition to the processing of angiotensin, but it is generally referred to as \"ACE.\" Relatively recently in the timescale of vertebrate evolution the ACE gene underwent an internal duplication producing the so-called somatic form of the enzyme which has two catalytic sites (the N-and C-domains) which, while similar, show some differences both in substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity. X-ray crystal structures for each of these domains in complex with selective inhibitors have revealed the molecular basis for this selectivity in the two peptide processing domains (Watermeyer et al. 2008) . Use of an alternative initiation site produces a form of ACE with only a single catalytic site expressed exclusively in mammalian testis which is critical to male reproduction (Hagaman et al. 1998) .",

            "text": "Vertebrates are now known to express the homologous peptidase ACE2 (Tipnis et al. 2000 ) whose actions seem to counterbalance those of ACE. ACE is, of course, of great importance in the regulation of blood pressure through its conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I into the vasopressor octapeptide angiotensin II by removal of the C-terminal dipeptide. Potent inhibitors of ACE, such as captopril or lisinopril, are hence highly effective anti-hypertensive agents (Menard and Patchett 2001) and do not inhibit ACE2 (Tipnis et al. 2000) . Figure 19 .1 illustrates the similarities between ACE and ACE2 and their counter-regulatory roles in angiotensin metabolism and hence cardiovascular biology. Most notably, ACE2 comprises only a single catalytic metalloprotease extracellular domain and its transmembrane and C-terminal cytoplasmic domain share no similarity with ACE but with a small membrane protein, collectrin, involved in amino acid transport in the kidney (Danilczyk et al. 2006 ). ACE2 appears to be a dual function protein since it also is involved in amino acid transport through interactions with its collectrin-like domains but functions as a protease (a strict carboxypeptidase) through its extracellular ACE-like domain (Kowalczuk et al. 2008 ). ACE2 has also been subverted into acting as the cellular receptor for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and the associated down-regulation of surface ACE2 following infection predisposes to the The domain organisation (a) and cellular topology (b) of ACE isoforms and collectrin, and a schematic representation (c) of proteolytic processing events involved in the functioning of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). (a and b) ACE isoforms (somatic -sACE, testicular -tACE, and ACE2) and collectrin, are type I integral membrane proteins with a signal peptide at the N-terminus and a short, C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The numbers above the proteins represent the amino acid numbering of the sequences. tACE and ACE2 possess a single HEXXH Zn-binding motif (HEMGH in both), which forms the active site, whereas sACE possesses two of these. Collectrin lacks a catalytic site but has 47.8% sequence identity with the non-catalytic extracellular, transmembrane and cytosolic domains of ACE2 and no similarity to ACE. (c) shows the processing pathway in the RAS from the protein precursor angiotensinogen (452 amino acids in the human), to the biologically active angiotensin peptides (the octapeptide angiotensin II and the heptapeptide angiotensin-(1-7). ACE -angiotensin-converting enzyme, NEP -neprilysin, AT 1 -type 1 angiotensin II receptor), AT 2 -type 2 angiotensin II receptor and Mas -angiotensin (1-7) receptor. The conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin (1-9) by ACE2 is kinetically 400 times less favourable than the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7) (Rice et al. 2004) acute, and potentially fatal, lung injury in the disease. Hence in a number of distinct disorders: SARS infection, cardiovascular disease, liver fibrosis and diabetes, effects all mediated through impaired angiotensin peptide metabolism, upregulation of ACE2 expression and activity can be beneficial (Turner 2008) .",

These enzymes are principally involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix, important in tissue remodeling and repair, and hence have trivial names such as collagenases, gelatinases, etc. but are generically referred to as matrix metalloproteases, matrixins or MMPs. Excessive activation of MMPS can result in significant pathological tissue damage as seen, for example, in arthritic conditions. The matrixins are generally synthesized as inactive precursors although differences exist in the activation mechanism. The matrixin proenzymes are held in a catalytically inactive state due to the presence of a \"cysteine switch\" (Van Wart and Birkedal-Hansen 1990), which involves interaction between a conserved cysteine in the propeptide and the catalytic zinc ion hence preventing the binding and activation of a crucial water molecule. Because of the importance of cysteine in the latency of the proenzymes, they can commonly be activated by thiol-blocking agents such as aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) (see e.g. Allinson et al. 2004) .",

NEP is a type II integral membrane protein composed of a short, cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region and a large extracellular region that folds into two domains that enclose a large, central cavity that contains the catalytic site (Oefner et al. 2000) . Ten cysteine residues in the extracellular domain are conserved between all family members and are involved in intrachain disulphide bonds required for maintenance of structure and activity (Turner et al. 2001) . NEP has important roles in modulating pain (through its actions on enkephalin peptides), blood pressure (through inactivation of atrial natriuretic peptide), prostate cancer (through metabolism of the mitogenic peptide, endothelin-1) and the immune system, being also identical with the common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen, CALLA or CD10 (LeTarte et al. 1988 ). It was for some long time the only known peptidase in family M13, but additional homologues are now known, including the endothelin converting enzymes (ECE-1 and ECE-2) responsible for the post-translational processing of the protein precursors of the endothelin family of hypertensive peptides ( Fig. 19.2) . This processing pathway, like many protein processing events involving hormones, neuropeptides and growth factors, involves the initial removal of the N-terminal signal prepeptide to generate a physiologically inactive proprotein subsequently processed in the secretory pathway at dibasic cleavage sites to its active form by one of the seven subtilisin-like proprotein convertases, which include furin (Rholam and Fahy 2009) . As intracellular, serine proteases they are not considered further in this chapter. In the endothelin pathway, it is likely that either furin or PC7 catalyses this processing event (Blais et al. 2002) . However, the endothelin processing pathway is unusual in protein processing events since the product of prohormone convertase action is another physiologically inert intermediate, termed \"big endothelin,\" which is in turn converted to the vasoactive endothelin by the metallopeptidase, ECE-1. When first identified, as the most potent, endogenous human vasoconstrictor known at the time, the endothelin system held much hope for development of novel cardiovascular therapeutics such as ECE-1 inhibitors, a promise that has yet to be fulfilled (Kirkby et al. 2008) .",

Endogenous physiological inhibitors of NEP have been described -sialorphin and opiorphin -which have analgesic activity of comparable potency to morphine, which is consistent with their inhibition of enkephalin inactivation by NEP (Rougeot et al. 2003; Wisner et al. 2006) . In recent years, much attention has focused on a newly discovered physiological activity of both NEP and ECE, is cleaved by a dibasic endopeptidase such as furin to generate biologically inactive big endothelin-1 (39 amino acids) (Yanagisawa et al. 1988 ). Big ET-1 is then cleaved at a Trp-Val bond by the metalloproteinase ECE-1 to release endothelin-1 (21 amino acids). Active ET-1 contains 2 intramolecular disulphide bonds (shown as straight lines) namely their ability to degrade the neurotoxic Alzheimer's amyloid peptide, Ab (Iwata et al. 2000) . Up-regulation of NEP (or ECE) may therefore provide an option for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by stimulating clearance of Ab -a therapeutic example of enhancing protein processing (Belyaev et al. 2009 ). While the homologous NEP and ECE serve complementary roles in Ab metabolism, they play opposing roles in the progression of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer through their respective effects on endothelin maturation (ECE-1) and inactivation (NEP) (Fig. 19.3) . Hence, upregulation of prostatic NEP or downregulation of ECE-1 could provide therapeutic options for this untreatable and aggressive stage of prostate cancer (Papandreou et al. 1998; Dawson et al. 2004 ).",

MPP removes an N-terminal targeting signal from mitochondrial precursor proteins hence targeting nuclear-encoded proteins to their correct location within mitochondria. IDE plays a role in insulin metabolism but also may be another physiologically significant amyloid (Ab)-degrading enzyme (Edland 2004) . This family are characterized by an inverted zinc-binding domain (HXXEH rather than HEXXH) although the reaction mechanism is similar, namely nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond by a water molecule activated by the zinc and polarized by an active site glutamate residue. The lack of potent or specific inhibitors for peptidases of this family has significantly hindered studies of their physiological functions, particularly in the case of IDE. However, mice with targeted deletion of the IDE gene show hyperinsulinaemia and glucose intolerance as well as increased accumulation of Ab in the brain supporting the proposed protein processing roles for the enzyme (Farris et al. 2003) .",

In androgen-dependent prostate cells, epithelial cells express high levels of NEP. NEP levels are up-regulated by androgens which also stimulate epithelial growth. Although epithelial cells produce the mitogenic peptide ET1 it is inactivated by NEP and does not stimulate cell growth. The stromal cells produce low levels of ECE-1 converting big ET-1 into ET-1 and this action is again opposed by the action of NEP. When androgen levels are low as in typical therapeutic surgical or drug regimes, NEP levels decrease allowing mitogenic peptides produced by epithelial cells to exhibit their growth-promoting effect. Also, under these conditions, the stromal cells express higher levels of ECE-1 producing even more ET-1 and encouraging cell invasion. ECE-1 levels then increase in epithelial cells which become metastatic and are no longer influenced by stroma. Hence, inhibition of ECE-1 activity in the stroma (or up-regulating the activity of NEP in epithelial cells) could provide a novel therapeutic strategy in prostate cancer by manipulating metallopeptidase levels.

Protein prenylation enhances membrane association of proteins. Human farnesylated-protein converting enzyme 1 may be important for processing prelamin A, a farnesylated protein that is cleaved twice. In cells with a defective peptidase gene, incompletely processed prelamin A accumulates in the nuclear envelope. Farnesylated-protein converting enzyme 1 performs the second processing step for prelamin A, releasing a 15-residue peptide containing the prenylated C-terminal Cys (Pendas et al. 2002) . The Oma1 endopeptidase is believed to degrade misfolded membrane proteins, thereby helping to maintain the integrity of the mitochondrial inner membrane (Kaser et al. 2003) .

They are all integral membrane proteins, and their extensive hydrophobicity, even within the sequences containing the active site residues, indicates that they cleave their substrates either within the membrane or very close to it. These peptidases are involved in the regulation of gene expression by the two-step proteolysis of transcriptional regulators. For example, following an initial cleavage in the lumen of the Golgi by the serine protease, (site-1 protease, S1P) (Bartz et al. 2008) , the zinc metallopeptidase S2P releases the N-terminal transcription factor domain, sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), from its membrane-bound precursor ( Fig. 19.4) . The released domain then enters the nucleus and activates genes that control cellular levels of cholesterol and phospholipids (Zelenski et al. 1999) . Bacterial RseP peptidase also cleaves transmembrane sequences and it now seems very likely that intramembrane proteolysis is a general activity of peptidases in family M50 related to cell regulation and signalling. The structure of a bacterial S2P-like protease has revealed elements of this unusual catalytic mechanism in which zinc and water-mediated peptide bond hydrolysis occurs in the hydrophobic environment of the lipid bilayer (Feng et al. 2007 ). Intramembrane proteolysis is involved in such diverse physiological and pathological events as bacterial sporulation, hepatitis C viral infection and Alzheimer's disease (Weihofen and Martoglio 2003) . In the latter case, it is an aspartic protease, g-secretase, that catalyses the intramembrane proteolytic processing event that is the final step in production of the neurotoxic amyloid Ab peptide (see below).",

However, the selective proteolysis of cell-surface proteins by proteases, commonly referred to as secretases or sheddases, is a more recent discovery, which is providing insight into a number of pathological conditions (see e.g. van Goor et al. 2009 for recent review). We first observed that the metalloproteinase ACE, which itself is an ectoenzyme at the endothelial cellsurface, could be released or shed from the membrane through the action of another distinct integral membrane proteinase, inhibitable by EDTA, and hence presumably a metalloenzyme (Hooper et al. 1987) . Hence, the soluble form of ACE found in plasma and used diagnostically to assess the effectiveness of ACE inhibitor therapy is derived as a result of a highly specific post-translational processing of the membrane-bound form of ACE. The physiological function of soluble ACE, if other than a down-regulation mechanism, is unknown although the soluble ectodomain could conceivably act as a ligand for another protein. ACE secretase, as we subsequently named the proteolytic activity, has turned out to be the prototype for a Fig. 19 .4 Schematic presentation of two-step proteolytic processing of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) precursor protein -an example of intramembrane proteolysis. First, the SREBP precursor protein is cleaved within the luminal loop between two transmembrane regions by a membrane-anchored serine protease termed S1P (the site-1 protease). Then, the site-2 protease (S2P) cleaves the processed protein within the transmembrane domain but close to the cytoplasmic membrane surface, releasing the SREBP transcription factor. S2P contains the conserved HEXXH motif common for metalloproteases. The regulatory cytoplasmic domain (R) of the SREBP precursor protein interacts with a cholesterol-sensor protein. The processing events are activated only if the cholesterol level is low (adapted from Wolfe 2009) family of such membrane protein secretases or sheddases, which cause the release of specific membrane proteins, normally from the cell-surface into the extracellular medium (Hooper et al. 1997; Huovila et al. 2005) .",

ADAM17 seems to be important (but not exclusive) to the shedding of these ligands and itself can be activated through activation of G protein-linked receptors by, for example, thrombin, endothelin-1 and angiotensin II. This process of indirect, receptor-mediated activation of the EGF receptor through ADAM-mediated protein processing has been termed transactivation and has particular implications in vascular remodelling and in cancer. In some cases, MMPs rather than ADAMs may contribute to shedding events. For example, MMP-9 may mediate the shedding of the b2 integrin subunit (CD18) from macrophages, N-cadherin and also the soluble CD40 ligand involved in platelet activation (Vaisar et al. 2009; Dwivedi et al. 2009; Mench\u00e9n et al. 2009 ).",

The cellular prion protein, which is essential for the development of a prion disease occurs both as a glycolipid-anchored membrane form and as a soluble, secreted form . Both ADAM9 and ADAM10, but not ADAM17, contribute to prion shedding and, intriguingly, the ADAM9-mediated shedding is an indirect process acting via ADAM10, which cleaves the prion protein only three residues away from the site of addition of the lipid anchor (Gly 228 -Arg 229 ) (Taylor et al. 2009 ). However, this shedding process does not appear to regulate the conversion of the prion protein to its transmissible neurotoxic form. Not surprisingly, in the light of its close involvement in the development of dementia, the complex processing of APP has been studied far more intensively and has led to a number of possible therapeutic avenues involving manipulation of protease activity or expression for treatment of the disease, some of which are currently in clinical trials.",

It was the Ab peptide which was originally identified as the main constituent of the extracellular neuritic plaques which characterize AD (Glenner and Wong 1984; Masters et al. 1985) and led to the formulation of the \"amyloid cascade\" hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (Hardy and Higgins 1992) . Accumulation of Ab is a characteristic feature of AD and its prevention is a primary target in therapeutic strategies. Late-onset forms of AD may primarily be due to deficiencies in Ab clearance rather than its formation (Hama and Saido 2005) and hence understanding clearance mechanisms and their regulation could be of fundamental importance and provide novel approaches to AD treatment. The exact role of the C-terminal proteolytic product AICD remains unclear and controversial but it probably acts as a transcriptional regulator together with the APP-tail binding protein Fe65 and the histone acetyltransferase (HAT), Tip60 (Cao and S\u00fcdhof 2001; Belyaev et al. 2009) (Fig. 19.5) .",

APP is a constitutive, transmembrane protein which undergoes proteolytic cleavage by b-and g-secretases producing a soluble ectodomain referred to as sAPPb, the neurotoxic amyloid b peptide (Ab) and the APP intracellular domain (AICD). Ab has the property to form neurotoxic oligomers and then to aggregate further, ultimately forming the so-called senile plaques, which are one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. This APP processing pathway is considered amyloidogenic in contrast with the cleavage of APP by the metalloproteinase a-secretase (ADAM protein) within the Ab domain, which prevents formation of Ab. This non-amyloidogenic processing leads to formation of the soluble ectodomain sAPPa, a short peptide p3 and AICD. AICD binds to the neprilysin (NEP) promoter and activates neprilysin expression (NEP) (Belyaev et al. 2009 ). This binding requires AICD stabilisation by Fe65 and also involves the histone-acetyl transferase, Tip60. AICD also controls expression of some other genes. If the NEP gene is silenced through histone deacetylation by HDACs, expression of NEP is inhibited. However, incubation of cells with VA, and hence inhibition of HDACs, allows AICD to bind to the NEP promoter and re-activate NEP expression (Belyaev et al. 2009 ). NEP, a cell-surface ectopeptidase, in turn, degrades Ab and reverses amyloid plaque accumulation. Ab can also be cleaved by ECE-1, ACE, matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs) and by the serine peptidase, plasmin. Cleavage of Ab can occur within the cells, at the cell surface (both along the neurites and cell bodies) and in the extracellular space. NEP and plasmin between them can cleave monomeric and oligomeric forms of Ab (Nalivaeva et al. 2008) ( Fig. 19.5) . Thus, the action of a-or b-secretases produces the largest products of APP -the soluble ectodomain proteins sAPP a and sAPP b , which play an important role in proliferation of neuronal cells and development of the nervous system (Caille et al. 2004; Conti and Cattaneo 2005; Taylor et al. 2008) . Metabolism of APP can undergo either an \"amyloidogenic\" pathway through the action of b-and g-secretases and production of Ab, or a non-amyloidogenic pathway, when APP is cleaved by a-secretase (Hooper and Turner 2002) . a-Secretase cleaves APP inside of the Ab sequence between lysine and leucine in positions 16 and 17, and prevents formation of the Ab peptide. Hence, inhibition of the amyloidogenic processing of APP and activation of the activity of a-secretase are possible approaches for prevention of AD (Lichtenthaler and Haass 2004) .",

The constitutive process of secretion of sAPPa under the action of a-secretase occurs at the cell surface (Parvathy et al. 1999 ). However, the regulated a-secretase activity, stimulated by cholinergic agonists such as muscarine and carbachol (Canet-Aviles et al. 2002) or phorbol esters (Zhu et al. 2001) , is reported to be localised mainly intracellularly (Jolly-Tornetta and Wolf 2000). In transgenic mice expressing human APP moderate neuronal overexpression of ADAM10 was shown to reduce the formation of Ab and prevent its deposits in the plaques. In contrast, expression of a mutant inactive ADAM10 led to an increase in the number and size of amyloid plaques in the brain of the same transgenic mice (Postina et al. 2004 ). Transgenic mice lacking ADAM10 or ADAM17 genes are lethal, suggesting that a-secretase plays an important role in the viability of the organism (Killar et al. 1999) , although these enzymes do have other important developmental and regulatory roles.",

Therapeutically, BACE1 provides an attractive drug target for AD since BACE knockout mice do not form Ab and appear to be healthy (Luo et al. 2001 ). Numerous approaches have been undertaken to find a clinically effective inhibitor of human b-secretase activity, mostly in the field of peptidomimetic, noncleavable substrate analogues (Hunt and Turner 2009 ). However, new endogenous protein substrates are continually being discovered for BACE-1, e.g. it cleaves membrane proteins APLP-1 and -2, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), membrane-bound sialyltransferase and LDL-receptor-related protein (LRP), and so caution is needed since BACE may have unexpected physiological roles. Most recently, BACE-1 is known to be required for proper myelination to occur through its processing of neuregulin (Willem et al. 2006) . The cytosolic fragment of APP formed by BACE (C99) is then a substrate for g-secretase (Fig. 19.5) . The latter represents a complex of several proteins involving presenilin proteins as the catalytic core. They are intramembrane proteases like the S2P protein but representing a different catalytic class of proteinase (aspartic rather than metallo). The signal peptide peptidases also represent aspartic intramembrane proteases. There are also examples of serine-type intra-membrane proteases, e.g. rhomboid proteases (Wolfe 2009 ).",

            "text": "Until recently, accumulation of Ab in the brain and other tissues was thought to be an irreversible process, leading to development of AD. However, in the brain there are biochemical pathways for elimination of Ab (Nalivaeva et al. 2008 ). In the last few years, several proteases, such as the metalloenzymes NEP, IDE, ECE-1 and ECE-2, as well as the serine proteinase plasmin have been found to be capable of degrading Ab in vitro and in vivo (Leissring et al. 2003; Turner et al. 2004 ). Most of these act extracellularly either as membrane-bound (ECE-1, NEP) or as soluble extracellular proteins (IDE, plasmin). IDE is anomalous in terms of its subcellular distribution since it is largely cytosolic (Akiyama et al. 1988 ) but also occurs within some organelles (mitochondria, peroxisomes) as well as in a soluble, secreted form yet it lacks any secretory signal in its sequence (Zhao et al. 2009 ). The mechanism of its secretion remains an enigma and it has been termed an \"unconventionally secreted protein\" (Zhao et al. 2009 ). Figure 19 .5 shows schematically Ab peptide aggregation and its proteolytic degradation by these various enzymes. Pathological down-regulation of these enzymes could predispose to accumulation of Ab and the development of AD. Thus, a possible therapeutic approach for treatment of AD might be a chronic upregulation of one or more of these proteases, either pharmacologically or through a gene therapy approach. These proteases are localised in a variety of subcellular compartments and cell types in the brain and remove Ab prior to its accumulation.",

This has particularly been the case in relation to the potential feedback regulation of the Ab-degrading enzyme, NEP (Pardossi-Piquard et al. 2005; Chen and Selkoe 2007) . However, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies have established that NEP expression is directly regulated through acetylation of core histones on the NEP promoter mediated via AICD and the inhibition of histone deacetylation with histone deacetylase inhibitors such as the anti-convulsant drug, valproate, or trichostatin A can potentiate NEP expression and activity (Belyaev et al. 2009 ). Valproate treatment in vivo in mice can reduce amyloid plaque formation (Qing et al. 2008) (Fig. 19 .5). These observations add to the growing body of literature (Saha and Pahan 2006; Fischer et al. 2007 ) emphasizing the potential beneficial effects of HDAC inhibitors in the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders, in this case through manipulation of metalloprotease expression.",

(a and b) ACE isoforms (somatic -sACE, testicular -tACE, and ACE2) and collectrin, are type I integral membrane proteins with a signal peptide at the N-terminus and a short, C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The numbers above the proteins represent the amino acid numbering of the sequences. tACE and ACE2 possess a single HEXXH Zn-binding motif (HEMGH in both), which forms the active site, whereas sACE possesses two of these. Collectrin lacks a catalytic site but has 47.8% sequence identity with the non-catalytic extracellular, transmembrane and cytosolic domains of ACE2 and no similarity to ACE. (c) shows the processing pathway in the RAS from the protein precursor angiotensinogen (452 amino acids in the human), to the biologically active angiotensin peptides (the octapeptide angiotensin II and the heptapeptide angiotensin-(1-7). ACE -angiotensin-converting enzyme, NEP -neprilysin, AT 1 -type 1 angiotensin II receptor), AT 2 -type 2 angiotensin II receptor and Mas -angiotensin (1-7) receptor. The conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin (1-9) by ACE2 is kinetically 400 times less favourable than the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7) (Rice et al. 2004)",
