            "text": "Earlier, Sanger\u2019s method of DNA sequencing was the only easy and popular method to determine the sequence of DNA molecule. On top of everything, this dideoxy chain termination method was diligently used for more than three decades from its discovery. Since the start of the twenty-first century, high-throughput sequencing technology has made an impact on the genomics research because it enabled genome-wide sequencing and screening far easier, inexpensive, and reproducible with lesser need of manpower (Metzker 2010). Using NGS, the genome of the bacteria can be sequenced in a single run. Sequencing of the DNA allows us to provide the basic information, i.e., the sequence/order of the nucleotides. After recognizing that this could be a magic tool to understand the gene sequences and location of the gene regulatory molecules, a UK-based team led by Dr. Frederick Sanger initiated work on DNA sequencing in 1972. He finally developed the \u201cdideoxy chain termination\u201d method for DNA sequencing and also published his work in 1977 (Sanger et al. 1977a). The method was based upon the base-specific termination of the growing chain. DNA polymerase adds the nucleotides on the chain, but upon the incorporation of dideoxynucleotide, the chain terminates due to its inability of the phosphodiester bond formation between newly coming nucleotide and dideoxynucleotide. In the same year 1977, a US team led by Maxam and Gilbert also published a chemical-based sequencing method in which the sequencing of DNA was dependent on chemical cleavage protocol (Maxam and Gilbert 1977). This method was based upon the use of harmful chemicals such as dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and hydrazine and hence was not that popular among molecular biologists. In contrast, the Sanger\u2019s method was accepted widely because of its easy protocol and use of lesser harmful reagents (Obenrader 2003). However, both Fredrick Sanger and Walter Gilbert were awarded with the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1980 for their DNA sequencing method discovery. Using Sanger\u2019s method, bacteriophage \u03a6X174 genome of 5386 bp was sequenced, and it was the beginning of the full DNA genome sequencing (Sanger et al. 1977b).",

Soon after this, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the first eukaryotic genome of size 12,156,677 bp sequenced in 1996 (Goffeau et al. 1996). Major breakthrough happened when human genome (14.8 billion bp) was sequenced and got published in 2001. The human genome was sequenced using two different approaches by two different independent teams. Using shotgun approach (where the genome got fragmented randomly), Dr. Craig Venter\u2019s team from a company called Celera Genomics published its dataset in 2001 (Venter et al. 2001), whereas Francis Collins group from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI, NIH) used the BAC contigs (bactigs) approach for the mapping of sequence.",

Apparently, the high rise in the complex diseases and their relation with the mutations/changes in the genome demand a far-flung knowledge of the genome sequence. Thus, it is required to sequence the genome of huge number of individuals as well as other organisms for the diagnosis and treatment in short period of time with low cost. This prompted the need of high-throughput sequencing technologies, which can provide information at substantially lower cost. Further, the development of high-throughput next-generation sequencing technology has proven that it can generate enormous data (millions of sequences) cost effectively and rapidly.",

In the last almost 15 years (from 2005), there are massive changes in the generation of sequencing technology. In short, changes in generation means the change in chemistry and platform. The widely accepted method of sequencing, i.e., Sanger\u2019s method of DNA sequencing, covered the first-generation sequencing along with Maxam-Gilbert method. Both methods were capable of sequencing about 1 kilobase length DNA fragment at one shot. In the process of analyzing longer sequences, researchers used the \u201cshotgun technique\u201d where overlapping sequences were cloned and sequenced separately followed by assembly into contigs (Anderson 1981). Sanger\u2019s method is one of the best methods for years to come for the sequencing of gene cloned in heterologous system because of its precision, robustness, and ease of use.",

Both methods were equally accepted in the beginning, but Sanger\u2019s method was extensively used for the routine sequencing purposes, which was based on the chain termination method. In the chain termination method, upon incorporation of the dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs), the growing chain terminates. Fragments of varied length (length varied by single nucleotide) of the DNA molecule then run on the traditional slab gels and pattern of bands obtained for the sequence determination. Subsequently, radiolabeling is replaced with fluorescently labeled (automated method of sequencing) ddNTPs, and the laser light at different wavelengths does the sequence determination (Smith et al. 1986). This method can generate a maximum read length that ranges from 800 to 1000 bp. In this method, only one fragment can be sequenced in one capillary, which means the output of one run is the length of the sequenced fragment.",

For sequencing of the whole genome of an organism, random fragmentation is done at particular size range and then fragments ligated to the oligonucleotide adaptors, which are platform specific, followed by independent parallel sequencing. Parallel analysis increases the sequencing speed. NGS offers the capability to produce massive volume of data from a single run at a very low cost in a very short duration without the need of fragment cloning strategy, which is generally used in conventional method. As we can see, there is a vast difference in the cost per genome sequencing in 2001 ($100M) as compared to the cost in 2017 (<$1K) (data from NHGRI genome sequencing program). Complete draft sequence of the human genome with the help of automated Sanger\u2019s method was published in 2001, which was the outcome of 13 years of rigorous efforts of international project of $2.7 billion. On the contrary, using NGS platform, the whole human genome can be sequenced in a week for a few thousand dollars (Gullapalli et al. 2012).",

The speed of the reaction is very fast as it just takes 3\u20134 s at room temperature to complete the reaction from addition of nucleotide to chemiluminescent detection. Later, 454 Life Sciences (a USA-based biotechnology company which was later acquired by Roche) took over this technology and commercialized it with some modifications. Pyrosequencing uses the enzyme luciferase from Photinus pyralis (American firefly) and recombinant ATP sulfurylase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Karamohamed et al. 1999). Two different approaches are available in pyrosequencing: (i) solid phase (Ronaghi et al. 1996) where DNA gets immobilized (based on three-enzyme cascade method with washing step) and (ii) liquid phase (Ronaghi et al. 1998) in which a nucleotide-degrading enzyme, pyrase, has been added (based on four-enzyme cascade method without washing step) which excludes the requirement of solid support because of which reaction can be performed in a single tube.",

However, traditional epidemiology generally catches the source of an outbreak, for example, by case control studies (King et al. 2012). For the past so many decades, laboratory investigation played a significant role in investigation and management of outbreak (Sabat et al. 2013). Now, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)-based typing is encouraging the employment of next-generation sequencing for investigations of public health. WGS is very useful in the detection of outbreak and its management locally and globally and also in the monitoring of evolution of multidrug resistance pathogens (Albiger et al. 2016). First application of WGS in public health was to dissect the epidemiological connections in hospital-acquired infections, for example, bacterial (Acinetobacterbaumannii) outbreak in 2010 in a hospital in Birmingham, UK (Lewis et al. 2010). In a very short time, several studies have shown that WGS has taken charge for interpretation and stopping of the transmission pathways of pathogens in hospital outbreaks. Few examples of characterization of newly emerging pathogens, which helped to stop the transmission/spread between patients at the same center and inter health care centers transmission, are Methicillin Resistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), carbapenem resistant Klebsiellapneumoniae (Harris et al. 2010; Snitkin et al. 2012) and early detection of K. pneumoniae high-risk clone (HiRiC) (Zhou et al. 2016).",

Upon characterization, WGS has the ability to reveal about isolates like species, strain, virulence, antibiotic resistance and much more information from the genome other than phylogenetic information to manage the case and outbreak. Investigation of foodborne disease and its outbreak management is the most important area for public health welfare, and WGS promises to identify those bacteria. According to a WHO survey, approximately 1900 million people get infected with foodborne pathogens every year and out of them, a big proportion (7,15,000) are not able to survive (2007\u20132015, Food Borne Disease Burden Epidemiology Reference Group). Great improvement has been found in the outbreak detected and outbreak solved (management) of listeriosis by traditional gold standard method in countries like France and US after implementation of WGS. Information about drug resistance and virulence characters can be taken into account for the clinical practice but more correlation among genotype and phenotype is required. Further, NGS data mining may disclose new targets, which may help in the investigation of outbreak by highly clonal pathogens. Remarkably, a major downside of NGS is that there is no standard guideline from controlling agencies for the sharing of data.",

There are organisms in our microbiota, which cannot be cultured and identified. Some very well-known spots are found for the colonization in the human body like stomach, vagina, colon, skin, esophagus, oral cavity, nose and hair. In 2008, National Institute of Health (NIH), USA has started two high-profile human microbiome projects of international level, namely, Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract (MetaHit) on the foundation of NGS as a tool. These projects were initiated to isolate and characterize microbes present in the healthy individuals and diseased and to develop the new methods for computational analysis of sequenced genomes. In the MetaHit program, from the sequencing of gut microbiome of 124 healthy adults having obesity, it was found that there are >1000 bacterial species present in the human gut microbiota. This revolutionary project was based on the de novo assembly of short reads from human microbiome datasets (Qin et al. 2010; Arumugam et al. 2011).",

The ongoing advances in sequencing platforms are not only supporting the characterization of whole genome of microbes but also are a valuable tool for the taxonomic identification of microbiomes, which are an inhabitant of particular niche. This enables us to detect polymicrobial infections and colonization at better perspective. Also, identification of new species using sequencing of metagenomes by implementing whole genome sequencing method or 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing from a mixed population. A new approach, that is, metatranscriptomic method of sequencing, has made the contribution in functional analysis of the interactions among different microbes of a single microbiome. In case of whole genome sequencing, we get longer read length, which enables us in better assembling of genome from diverse organisms. By using reference sequences or denovo clustering, taxonomy profiling can also be performed. Nowadays, it is very much noticeable that imbalance of gut microbiome (also known as dysbiosis) is intensely connected with the immune disorder development and/or improper metabolic functioning (Kim et al. 2015). Here, we can say that microbiomics has its use in a very controlled manner at the point of care. For instance, if a person is suffering from meningitis and doctors/clinicians are not able to identify (pathogen eluding the clinicians like criminal eluding the police), then microbiomics plays pivotal role for the identification of the responsible pathogen, be it bacteria or amoeba. This identification helps the clinicians to precisely medicate (precision medicine) the patient with choice of antibiotics. In other words, genomics in these cases is life saving.",

Earlier, the origin of the disease causing microbe and its diagnosis was only based upon the evidence of the existence of a given pathogen in a particular given sample. This standard time-taking method of culture-based identification/detection is still being used. However, this classical approach has many limitations, which include problem in cultivation of certain species of microbes like viruses and some other pathogens, which are hard to grow in culture. Further, culturing of microbes is time consuming and too expensive. Nucleic acid based diagnostic methods, for example, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), have progressively replaced the culturing method. PCR-based method is cost effective, sensitive and specific but the main limitation is that it demands prior hypothetical knowledge. It can only identify the conserved targets of the pathogen and cannot distinguish between genotypes; this again restricts the detection of new emerging pathogens (Lecuit and Eloit 2014). Other methods for diagnosis were also developed, which include multiplex PCR assays, enzyme-linked immunoassays and pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to widen the pathogen detection sensitivity and specificity. But, these conventional methods also do not prove to be much useful because of insensitivity for clinical diagnosis.",

The field of \u201cdiagnosis genomics\u201d or \u201cpathogenomics\u201d has unveiled emerging and re-emerging pathogens that translate the genomic technologies into methods for diagnosis. This new method has facilitated high-resolution mapping of the genetic determinants in microorganisms that uphold the pathogenicity. Whole genome sequencing and targeted amplicon sequencing of rRNA genes have come up as favored technologies for microbial identification from primary human specimens and to analyze the dynamic genomes with a high moldability that is a must for pathogens to cling to life in arduous environment (Edwards and Rohwer 2005; Weinstock 2012). Analysis of genomes using whole genome sequencing delivers high-resolution information to differentiate microbial strains that possess difference of as low as one Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP), thereby it can replace other multiple tests. For the detection of pathogenic microorganism from patients having suspected infections from uncultivable microbe and or not possible to diagnose by standard diagnostic method, whole genome sequencing method is an ideal option. In such cases, specimen directly from the patient can be sequenced. Here is an example of the strong ability of the whole genome sequencing method in diagnosis of a pediatric instance of alymphocytosis or severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and recurrent meningoencephalitis, where this whole genome sequencing together with a dedicated bioinformatics software (Naccache et al. 2014) diagnosed the Leptospirasantarosai in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (total DNA from CSF) using Illumina platform within 48 hours\u2019 time from the sample collection, where 475 sequence reads were aligned with the pathogen out of 3,063,784 total reads (Wilson et al. 2014).

Recently, studies are based on newer methods like pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) or multilocus variable number tandem repeat (MLVNTR) analysis to identify the specific species of microbe in animals and humans (Sabat et al. 2013). Nonetheless, still so much is left to understood, mainly frequency of transmission (number of contacts needed for the transmission from animals), risk factor linked with the acquiring of zoonotic agent and how the transfer of pathogen from animal to human is affected by antibiotic use in animal. For all these topics, NGS shows a newer perspective. This is also unraveling the difference in previously indistinguishable strains of human and animal (Harrison et al. 2013). Besides, NGS also permits a wide range analysis of how the use of antibiotics changes the specific microbiome and effects on interspecies transmission. Current projects are based on whole genome sequencing methods that will help to understand the dynamics and mechanism of transmission of pathogen between animals, human and environment. A recent study by a veterinary research group has revealed the presence of mcr-1gene (using whole genome sequencing method) in three E. coli strains isolated from poultry meat. Although this gene is not carried by any human strain, two of the three strains were related to ST117 (avian pathogenic E. coli), which is a common strain between human and poultry animal.

Also, it was revealed that human and animal isolates of the same farm were only varied by few number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP). This analysis supports the possibility of zoonotic transmission of MRSA isolates. The study further shows that mecC-MRSA ST130 isolates can transmit between animal and human (Harrison et al. 2013). And this mecC gene is liable for the resistance to the penicillin like antibiotic methicillin. This study emphasizes the role of farm animal (livestock) as a likely reservoir of antibiotic resistant pathogen.",

Furthermore, the reports reveal that this new bacteria is now playing the lead role to cause diphtheria in past years in several economically developed countries. Here also, next-generation sequencing approach enables us to identify the novel virulence genes rapidly acquired by C. ulcerans and a putative pathogenicity island, which possesses the diphtheria toxin gene. This rapid acquisition of genes changes the virulence of the strain even in single round of zoonotic transmission. During genomewide sequencing/SNP profiling of pair of patient and domestic animal companion, it was revealed that there is very less or almost no difference between their profiles. This supports the idea that C. ulcerans encounter zoonotic transmission between human and animal. In addition to this, these results demonstrate that NGS helps in improving the phylogenetic and epidemiological studies by giving insights between closely relative isolates.",

However, the information obtained from NGS data will also bring advantage to the medical field with respect to better diagnostics and therapeutics.
