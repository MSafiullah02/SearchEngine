Although a standard precaution was taken, this nosocomial infection was neither modified by isolation of patients nor protected by measures such as wearing N95 masks against the new pathogen, because the cause of this atypical pneumonia was unknown in the early phase of the outbreak [24]. All the infection spread originally from one case from Hong Kong within 2 months. It implies that natural course of nosocomial infection of SARS was observed in Vietnam. This was an unfortunate event but was a major advantage for us to assess genetic risk factors, minimizing other confounding factors. Moreover, the study population was limited to be Vietnamese ethnicity for genetic analysis. Questionnaires taken by trained interviewers and chest radiographs of all cases in this study, and clinical records of most of the cases were available to evaluate clinical status in detail. As a result, 44 out of 54 accessible cases of ethnic of Vietnamese were enrolled and this achieved high coverage of this study. Although the number of cases is not enough to reach a definite conclusion in a case-control design, we were able to extract an attractive candidate gene in this study.",

The frequency of D allele of SARS cases was not different from that of the healthy contacts, and the D allele did not appear to influence development of SARS itself. There was also no difference in the frequency of D allele between healthy contacts and non-contacts. In other words, contact history did not affect the genotype distribution.",

This pathological status is characterized by increased permeability of alveolar\u2013capillary barrier, which consists of two separate barriers, microvascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium [25]. When these barriers are damaged, the permeability of alveolar\u2013capillary barrier increases and protein-rich edema fluids flow into alveolar spaces from blood vessel [25]. A previous report indicated that AT-I increased vascular permeability in Rat [26]. Another report showed that AT-II induces apoptosis of human alveolar epithelial cells [27]. The degree of epithelial injury seems to influence the outcome of ARDS [25]. The serum ACE levels of individuals who have genotype DD are almost twice as high as that of genotype II [16]. It is conceivable that D allele might influence the activity of renin\u2013angiotensin system via elevation of serum or local ACE level, and then this may lead to damage of endothelium or epithelium of the lung.",
