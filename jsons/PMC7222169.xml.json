            "text": "The Papillomaviridae (PV) family was once part of the larger family of Papovaviridae which was split into Polyomaviridae and Papillomaviridae by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (Van Regenmortel 2000). According to the most recent ICTV classification, the PV family includes two subfamilies Firstpapillomavirinae with 52 genera and Secondpapillomavirinae with one genus and one species (Van Doorslaer et al. 2018). Genera are named according to the Greek alphabet from alpha to omega, and following exhaustion of the alphabet the term dyo and treis (Greek for second time and third, respectively) coined to accommodate the extra genera e.g. dyo-deltapapillomaviruses (Bernard et al. 2010). There are about 405 known reference PVs uptodate as listed in the curated PAVE database (https://pave.niaid.nih.gov/), 226 of these are human papillomaviruses (HPVs) and 179 from different animal species (Van Doorslaer and Dillner 2019). HPVs are the most studied and are distributed over 5 genera (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Mu and Nu). The other PV genera are from other mammals, birds and reptiles (Bernard et al. 2010). Below the genus level are species and below the species level are PV types (de Villiers et al. 2004). Different genera have less than 60% similarity within the L1 gene, while species share between 60 and 70% similarity and types share between 71 and 89% similarity. The ICTV is responsible for nomenclature of viruses down to species level, and below species level, the International Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Reference Centre (Karonliska Institute, Sweden) and the Animal Papillomavirus Reference Centre (University of Arizona, USA) assigns unique PV-type numbers after the complete genome has been sequenced, cloned and confirmed by the Centre (M\u00fchr et al. 2018).",

            "text": "Traditionally, PVs have been thought to evolve slowly because they replicate by co-opting high-fidelity host cellular DNA polymerases that have an error rate of about 4.3 \u00d7 10\u2212 5 substitutions per nucleotide site per year (Korona et al. 2011). The general assumption is that PVs have co-evolved with their hosts (Chen et al. 2009a; Bravo and Felez-Sanchez 2015; Dube Mandishora et al. 2018). Selection pressures due to host immune responses differ among PV genes and result in these genes displaying different substitution rates. Further, the cellular polymerases of different host species may differ in their degree of fidelity such that virus lineages infecting different hosts might display different substitution rates (de Oliveira et al. 2015). The popular views about PV evolution have been (1) they are static and slow evolving viruses with very low mutation rates (2) host linked co-divergence (3) strict tissue tropism (4) host specific and (5) lack of recombination (Bravo et al. 2010). However, the understanding of PV evolution has advanced over the years, with various alternative mechanisms such as inter-species transmission, adaptive radiation and recombination (Angulo and Carvajal-Rodriguez 2007; Carvajal-Rodriguez 2008; Gottschling et al. 2011; Robles-Sikisaka et al. 2012).",

PV recombination could be more appropriately named, gene conversion, but it has been so widely used that changing it would introduce confusion to the whole subject. Recombination has a potential major impact on PV evolution, pharmacogenomics and vaccine development. In other viruses, recombination has been associated with emergence of novel viruses, increase in virulence and pathogenesis, changes in tissue tropisms and expansion of viral host ranges (Martin et al. 2011; Simon-Loriere and Holmes 2011).",

However, the study of PV recombination has been hampered by technical difficulties associated with the accurate alignment of highly diverse PV gene sequences (Posada and Crandall 2001). One of the most commonly used approaches to recombination detection is the use of the various recombination analysis tools implemented within the RDP4 software package (Martin and Rybicki 2000). During recombination detection, RDP4 rigorously tests the quality of sequence alignments to guard against the detection of false-positive recombination signals that arise due to sequence misalignment (Varsani et al. 2006).",

This common recombination event shows HPV30 as the recombinant and HPV54 as the major parent. HR-HPV54 is also a major parent in 3 other recombination events, event 3 and 6 in R2 and event 9 in R3. Thus, HPV54 is a major parent in a total of six recombination events in all the three analyses.

Chen et al. demonstrated specific host niche adaptation of primate PVs ensued thereafter by host co-divergence to have occurred at least 40MYA (Chen et al. 2018, 2019), which concurs with our prediction. Our observation suggests that more than 76MYA these viruses were in the same biological niche (same host). As the hosts evolved and diversified, the viruses adapted to specific host niches, which eventually led to coevolution with specific hosts, and this occurred before the speciation events of all primate host species including humans. Recombination events among Cetacean PVs detected in this study have also been previously reported elsewhere (Robles-Sikisaka et al. 2012), but were not the mainstay of this study.",

These infections create a conducive environment for recombination to occur within the same biological niche or anatomical site through availing or enhancing DNA viral load, which in turn increases the probability of genomes to recombine.

However, the Alpha-PVs A1 and A2 trees showed congruence, seemingly rendering recombination an unimportant driving force in their evolution. The congruence can be explained by the low number (82) of Alpha-PV sequences currently available for the analysis to make inferential conclusions. Thus, the low number of sequences imply a lack of power for detection of phylogenetic incongruence. Moreover, the fact that essentially 7 sequences (PpPV1, MfPV7, HPV54, HPV70, HPV68, HPV39 and HPV66) of the 82 Alpha-PVs showed recombination events explains how these could not have changed the phylogeny of the whole Alpha-PV genus, with or without recombination regions from these 7 sequences.
