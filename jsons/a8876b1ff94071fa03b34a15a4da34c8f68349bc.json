It starts as an interstitial edema before it turns into alveolar edema, because the pulmonary veins lie in the interstitium.

This process is rapid, and only very early edema can be seen as a pure interstitial linear pattern in chest radiographs.",

ARDS is a situation where an alveolar capillary injury occurs as a result of variety of causes (e.g., sepsis). Chemical pneumonitis is a pulmonary edema that occurs due to inhalation of noxious chemical substance such as ammonia, smoking inhalation, near drowning situations, and gastric acid aspiration. The mechanism of pulmonary edema is the result of one of three mechanisms: irritation of the tracheo-bronchial tree that leads to infl ammation and pulmonary edema formation; absorption of the noxious material from the respiratory tract, which can affect the lungs directly by its metabolites; and asphyxiation due to inhalation of high concentration of the noxious material that will displace oxygen from the blood and cause tissue hypoxia. Drug-induced and transfusion reactions pulmonary edema arise due to anaphylactic lupus-like reaction formation. The radiographic picture cannot be differentiated from ARDS unless you have history of drug ingestion or recent transfusion reaction. Classic examples of drugs causing pulmonary edema are heroin, aspirin, and penicillin. Negative pressure pulmonary edema is a term used to describe noncardiogenic edema that arises due to acute airway obstruction (type 1), or after the relief of chronic airway obstruction (type 2).",

Most community-associated MRSA strains carry the Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) gene, which is rarely found in the hospitalacquired MRSA or the normal strain of S. aureus .
