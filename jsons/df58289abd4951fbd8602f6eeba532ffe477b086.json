The particles size of 0.3 micron is used as a standard to measure the effectiveness of HEPA filters, but this does not mean they are not able to catch smaller particles. A paper from the NASA 3 well explains that HEPA filters are highly effective in capturing a very high proportion, up to 100%, of nanoparticulate contaminants, ranging in size from 0.1 to 0.001 micron (diffusion regime) because they don't fly straight, collide with other fast-moving molecules, move around in random pathways and hit the filter fibers remaining stuck in them. This is known as the Brownian movement. The intersecting regime has just a small drop in efficiency that affects the particles of around 0.3 \u03bcm, defined as most penetrating particle size (MPPS). This value for a typical HEPA filter varies from 0.2 to 0.3 micron, depending on flow rate, and lowering the flow speed, a simple HEPA will perform as an ULPA filter.",
