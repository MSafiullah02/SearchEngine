Diseases of the gastrointestinal tract are among the most frequent complications of the acquired immunode\u00aeciency syndrome (AIDS). Oesophageal disease occurs in 30\u00b1 40% of patients, and the incidence of diarrhoea may be as high as 90%, particularly for patients with severe immunode\u00aeciency. 1\u00b14 The incidence of some disorders has been unfavourably altered by the widespread use of prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. 5\u00b16 Over the last decade, greater experience with gastrointestinal disorders in these patients has resulted in a better appreciation of the spectrum of potential aetiologies, and an improved approach to evaluation and therapy. Fortunately, our therapeutic options have expanded due to the application of old drugs to new problems as well as through the development of newer agents. Nevertheless, truly effective therapy is still lacking for some opportunistic infections. This review will focus on the therapy and prophylaxis for the most common infections involving the gastrointestinal tract in HIV-infected patients (see Table 1 ).",

            "text": "Oropharyngeal and oesophageal candidiasis are common opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients, and are frequently the initial manifestation of infection. Oropharyngeal candidiasis (thrush) is readily diagnosed by the characteristic white plaques which coat the buccal mucosa. Oropharyngeal candidiasis may occasionally present as diffuse erythaema without plaques or angular cheilitis. 7 It is important to differentiate oral hairy leukoplakia from thrush, given the different aetiology and therapy. Although Candida albicans is by far the most common cause of candidiasis, other nonalbicans species cause the same disease including C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata. 8 In SUMMARY Although there have been dramatic strides in the therapy of human immunode\u00aeciency virus infection over the last few years, the number of infected people world-wide is tremendous and, at least in developing countries, continues to expand. Complications which involve the gastrointestinal tract are common in these patients, because the gut is a major site for involvement by opportunistic infections and neoplasms in patients with the acquired immunode\u00aeciency syndrome. It is important to recognize the clinical spectrum of gastrointestinal diseases, as well as the appropriate and most cost-effective diagnostic strategies, as therapies for a number of these disorders are both widely available and highly effective. This review summarizes the major gastrointestinal infections which are seen in patients with the acquired immunode\u00aeciency syndrome, and their treatment. general, determining the aetiologic species is unnecessary since therapy is the same. Clinically, oesophageal candidiasis may be strongly suspected in the patient with thrush, moderately severe immunode\u00aeciency (CD4 lymphocyte count < 200/mm 3 ), and oesophageal symptoms. 9 However, thrush may be absent in one-third of patients with oesophageal candidiasis. 9 A de\u00aenitive diagnosis rests on the identi\u00aecation of typical yeast forms in endoscopic mucosal biopsies or oesophageal brushings. The detection of Candida does not exclude other disorders, as Candida may coexist with other oesophageal processes in 14\u00b125% of symptomatic patients. 1 ",

            "text": "Therapy Topical non-systemic therapy has been the mainstay of treatment for oropharyngeal candidiasis. Although nystatin is effective, clotrimazole troches have now largely replaced nystatin as the principal non-systemic agent used due to its ease of administration, palatability, negligible side-effects and drug interactions, and effectiveness. Clinical cure is seen in 65\u00b194% of patients following 14 days of clotrimazole therapy. 13, 14 The \u00aerst oral systemic antifungal agent available for widespread clinical use was ketoconazole. This agent has a broad spectrum of antifungal activity which includes Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomyces, has minimal ef\u00aecacy for Cryptococcus and lacks activity against Mucormycosis and Sporothrix. 15 It requires an acid milieu for absorption. Fluconazole, released in 1990, has a broader spectrum of antifungal activity than ketoconazole, including Cryptococcus. Excellent absorption, regardless of gastric pH, and long half-life (%30 h), make this an ideal oral antifungal agent. Importantly, the pharmacokinetics of\u00afuconazole are similar in HIV-infected patients as compared to other immunocompromised hosts. 16 Fluconazole is excreted solely in the urine; therefore, dose adjustments may be required in patients with renal insuf\u00aeciency. Itraconazole is the newest oral systemic antifungal agent. Like\u00afuconazole, it has a broad spectrum of antifungal activity, prolonged half-life and is well tolerated. Similar to ketoconazole, elevations in gastric pH retard absorption. 17 Contrasts and comparisons between these agents are listed in Table 2 The drugs marked with * have been used for prophylaxis. candidiasis in HIV-infected patients. Fluconazole has been shown to be superior to clotrimazole troches for oropharyngeal candidiasis. 13, 14 The largest comparative trial 14 suggested overall equivalency, although uconazole-treated patients were more likely to have mycologic cure (65% vs. 48%) and had a lower rate of relapse at 2 weeks (82% vs. 50%); this relapse difference was equal at 1 month follow-up. Single-dose therapy with\u00afuconazole 150 mg is as effective as a 7-day treatment course. 18 Unlike oropharyngeal disease, non-systemic therapy (e.g. nystatin) is largely ineffective for oesophageal candidiasis. At most centres,\u00afuconazole has become the drug of choice for oesophageal candidiasis in AIDS. Randomized trials have shown\u00afuconazole to be superior to ketoconazole for both oropharyngeal 19, 20 and oesophageal candidiasis. 21 In a prospective randomized trial, Laine and colleagues 21 compared ketoconazole 200 mg/day to\u00afuconazole 100 mg/day in 143 patients with AIDS and oesophageal candidiasis. Endoscopic cure and symptom resolution were found in 91% and 85%, respectively, of\u00afuconazole-treated patients, compared to 52% and 65%, respectively, for patients randomized to ketoconazole. Clinical cure paralleled endoscopic cure. Both drugs were well tolerated with very few side-effects. The response rate of oesophageal candidiasis with\u00afuconazole tends to be very rapid, with most patients experiencing signi\u00aecant clinical improvement by 3\u00b15 days. 12, 22 Itraconazole 200 mg/day was found to be equivalent to ketoconazole 200 mg b.d. for oropharyngeal and oesophageal candidiasis. 23 Another study 24 found greater endoscopic cure at 3 weeks (75% vs. 38%) with\u00afuconazole 100 mg b.d. compared to itraconazole 100 mg b.d., although no differences in short-term clinical remission (78% vs. 73%) were demonstrated. In the largest study reported to date, Barbaro et al. 25 randomized 2213 AIDS patients with a \u00aerst episode of Candida oesophagitis to\u00afuconazole or itraconazole. Clinical cure was achieved in 81% of\u00afuconazole-treated patients compared to 75% of itraconazole-treated patients (P < 0.001), although there was no difference at the end of the follow-up period (96%). Approximately 25% of patients in both groups required an increase in dosage at 2 weeks.",

Because of its toxicity, this drug is used almost exclusively in patients with thrush and/or oesophageal candidiasis with clinical and/or microbiologically resistant Candida. Although large studies evaluating the ef\u00aecacy of amphotericin B for oesophageal candidasis in AIDS have not been conducted, clinical experience suggests this agent is highly effective. The use of intralipid with amphotericin B infusion may reduce some of the side-effects. 29, 30 Low doses of amphotericin B (0.5 mg/kg/day for 7\u00b110 days) are usually adequate therapy for oropharyngeal and oesophageal candidiasis. The availability of a new lipid formulation (liposomal amphotericin B) reduces the side-effects and toxicity and maintains ef\u00aecacy, although at a markedly increased cost. 31 A suspension form of amphotericin B for oral use is now commercially available, and may \u00aend its greatest utility in patients with resistant thrush. 32",

A number of studies of both oropharyngeal and oesophageal candidiasis have now documented clinical and microbiological resistance to these azole agents, most notably\u00afuconazole. 33, 34 Testing of Candida isolates from patients with AIDS have found resistance in up to 33%. 35\u00b137 The mechanism(s) for drug resistance are incompletely understood. Risk factors for resistance include prior use of azole drugs including total dosage, severe immunode\u00aeciency (CD4 lymphocyte count < 100/mm 3 ), and recurrent episodes of candidiasis. 27\u00b139 Some patients may harbour resistant strains without any prior azole therapy. 35 In vitro resistance correlates with clinical resistance. 38, 40\u00b143 With prolonged azole use, there may be selection of a single resistant strain 44\u00b146 as well as an increase in nonalbicans strains, 8 which are inherently more resistant to these drugs. 46 Despite an increase in MIC, clinical response to\u00afuconazole is usually maintained regardless of high-level resistance. 37 With\u00afuconazole resistance, the MIC to other azoles, such as itraconazole, may also increase; 36 resistance to one azole therefore suggests cross-resistance to others. 47 Although most\u00afuconazoleresistant strains remain susceptible to itraconazole, there is an upward shift of the MIC to itraconazole, 48 which may result in a poor clinical response. Return of sensitivity to\u00afuconazole has been noted following drug discontinuation. 34 It is unclear whether intermittent azole use leads to greater resistance than continued drug administration. 49 Mild drug resistance can often be overcome with increases in the dosage of the antifungal agent; up to 800 mg/day of\u00afuconazole have been used. If higher doses are clinically ineffective or cause side-effects, switching to another azole can be tried; if there is no response, amphotericin B is effective. Microbiological and clinical resistance to amphotericin B is very rare. Nystatin or clotrimazole may occasionally be effective in patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis and clinical resistance to systemic azole agents. Combination therapy of\u00afucytosine with azoles for drug resistance has not been well studied. 50 Until further studies are available which clarify the mechanisms of drug resistance, it appears prudent to limit the use of azoles where possible.",

In contrast to ganciclovir, foscarnet has no myelosuppressive effects, but causes renal insuf\u00aeciency and disturbances in calcium, phosphorus and magnesium homeostasis. 74 Foscarnet is an anionic compound that binds divalent cations, such as calcium and phosphorus, which accounts for the metabolic effects on these cations. Adjustments in dosage based on creatinine clearance, and the intravenous administration of isotonic saline prior to and during foscarnet infusion help prevent renal insuf\u00aeciency. 74 When symptomatic, electrolyte disturbances may be treated by oral supplementation. Coadministration of foscarnet with intravenous pentamidine should be avoided given the similar effects on calcium homeostasis. Similarly, drugs which cause renal insuf\u00aeciency such as amphotericin B and aminoglycosides should be used cautiously when administering foscarnet. Genital ulceration in both males and females has been reported, and appears to be due to exposure of these tissues to high urinary concentrations of foscarnet. 74 The newest agent released for the treatment of CMV disease is cidofovir. This drug is a nucleotide analogue with activity against all herpes viruses; it has a very long half-life and can be given once weekly. It must be given with probenecid to prevent renal insuf\u00aeciency. 75 To date this drug has been tested exclusively in patients with retinal disease, but future studies assessing ef\u00aecacy for gastrointestinal CMV disease are anticipated. The ef\u00aecacy, tolerability and cost of ganciclovir have established it as \u00aerst line therapy for gastrointestinal CMV disease in AIDS. Our current policy for the therapy of gastrointestinal CMV disease is to administer intravenous ganciclovir, assuming there are no major contraindications to this agent such as pancytopenia. We treat with induction doses for 2\u00b14 weeks, depending on the clinical and endoscopic response. In our experience, oesophageal disease tends to respond more rapidly than does colonic disease. Endoscopic re-examination following therapy is important for those patients with persistent symptoms. Ophthalmological examination is mandatory at the time of diagnosis in all patients to exclude retinal disease; long-term drug administration will be necessary in these patients. Failure to respond to ganciclovir may be the result of low serum levels 76 or drug resistance. 62 For patients with major contraindications to ganciclovir or in whom bone marrow stimulating factors are ineffective, foscarnet should be given. If a patient does not respond to ganciclovir (and the diagnosis is well established), foscarnet is usually effective. 68, 77 Combination therapy of foscarnet and ganciclovir appears to be effective for ganciclovir failures and has been used as primary therapy. 78, 79 (See Table 3 for comparisons between ganciclovir and foscarnet.)",

In one study, 80 the incidence of CMV disease at 1 year was 14% in the treated group compared to 26% in the placebo group. The number of patients developing gastrointestinal CMV was low in both groups. The development of resistance is a concern with long-term use of oral ganciclovir.

            "text": "The emergence of the AIDS epidemic has greatly expanded the spectrum of gastrointestinal protozoal infections. Unlike fungi and viruses, these pathogens primarily involve the small intestine. As such, they play the greatest role as causative agents of diarrhoea. These pathogens may also infect biliary epithelium, resulting in the AIDS cholangiopathy syndrome. 95, 96 Cryptosporidia In most series, Cryptosporidium parvum is the most common protozoal infection causing diarrhoea, identi-\u00aeed in up to 11% of symptomatic patients. 97 Although a cause of acute diarrhoea, cryptosporidiosis is most commonly found in HIV-infected patients with chronic diarrhoea. Outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis are well described in both immunocompetent and immunode\u00aecient hosts and result from contamination of public water sources. 98, 99 In contrast to immunocompetent patients with cryptosporidiosis, where spontaneous cure is uniform, the natural history is much more variable in HIV-infected patients. 100 This variablity is due to the effect of immunode\u00aeciency, as patients with CD4 lymphocyte counts > 180/mm 3 usually have a selflimited illness, 101 whereas in patients with a CD4 count < 50/mm 3 , the disease is often devastating, resulting in severe malabsorption, electrolyte disturbances, dehydration and weight loss, with a median survival of <12 weeks. 100 The pathogenesis of mucosal injury is poorly understood, although the degree of architectural distortion (villous atrophy) and in\u00afammation are related to the parasite burden. 102 Therapy. Over 60 therapies have been used for the treatment of intestinal cryptosporidiosis, most without success. 103 Several case reports suggest that immune reconstitution, either through potent antiretroviral therapy 104 or improvements in nutritional status, 105 may result in a clinical remission. A novel therapy includes the use of bovine colostrum. This consists of a concentrate of immunoglobulin prepared from bovine colostrum following immunization with cryptosporidial antigens; 106, 107 case reports have demonstrated clinical improvement in 50% of patients following the use of bovine colostrum. The results of an open-label trial 108 found a reduction in stool frequency and weight in patients receiving the powder (but not pill) formulation of bovine immunoglobulin, although less than half of the patients had a 50% reduction in stool weight or clearance of the pathogen from the stool. 108 Letrazuril, a drug with activity against coccidia, was found to have some ef\u00aecacy in two studies. 109, 110 The most effective agent currently available for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis is paromomycin. This non-absorbable 111 oral aminoglycoside agent has previously been used for the treatment of other parasitic diseases, but its mechanism of action for cryptosporidiosis is unknown. In vitro models using a human enterocyte cell line suggest an antimicrobial effect, 112 whereas a study using cryptosporidia in culture did not demonstrate sensitivity with this agent. 113 Case reports and small open-label trials of paromomycin have documented response rates up to 100%. 103, 114\u00b1116 In a study of 35 patients, a complete response was seen in 20% of patients, with a partial response observed in an additional 43%; 116 responders had higher preserved immune function as assessed by CD4 count. In a prospective open-label trial of 24 patients, 22 (92%) had a clinical response, with a complete remission observed in 18. 115 In the 22 responders, clearance of the organisms was noted on follow-up stool studies and/or small bowel biopsy. Other studies, however, have found persistent oocyst excretion, despite clinical improvement. 114 The ef\u00aecacy of paromomycin was best shown in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial of 10 patients, where both stool frequency and oocyst excretion were signi\u00aecantly reduced with paromomycin as compared to placebo. 117 Although the available literature supports the use of this agent, in our experience and others, 99 those patients with the most severe disease (and most severe immunode\u00aeciency) are the least likely to respond. If the CD4 count is >200/mm 3 , drug discontinuation after clinical cure is appropriate with close follow-up. For those patients with a CD4 count < 100/mm 3 in whom therapy is clinically effective, long-term administration is required to prevent relapse. Nevertheless, despite continued therapy, relapse may still occur. 115 ",

Intense investigation has demonstrated that these parasites are common intestinal and biliary pathogens in patients with AIDS. 118\u00b1120 Microsporidia are a heterogeneous group of obligate intracellular spore-forming (coccidian) protozoa which may involve a variety of organ systems causing either localized or disseminated disease. 121, 122 The environmental source and mode of transmission of these pathogens are unknown. Six microsporidial genera have been linked to human disease; gastrointestinal disease has been reported from only two of these, Enterocytozoon bienusi and Encephalitozoon intestinalis; E. bienusi is the cause of most cases of gastrointestinal disease. 121 Coinfection with these two microsporidia or with other pathogens has been reported. 123 In some studies of HIV-infected patients, microsporidia are the most commonly identi\u00aeed pathogen. Kotler and Orenstein 119 found microsporidia in 39% of AIDS patients undergoing gastrointestinal evaluation for diarrhoea. This high prevalence is probably not related to an increasing incidence of disease, but rather to greater recognition and improved diagnostic testing. Although electron microscopy of small bowel biopsies is considered the gold standard for diagnosis, recent studies have shown haematoxylin and eosin, brown-brenn, Giemsa, or modi\u00aeed trichrome staining of small bowel biopsies to have sensitivities of 77\u00b183% with speci\u00aecities approaching 100%; 121, 124 large comparative trials of stool testing with small bowel biopsy are lacking. 125 Immunouorescent stains are being developed and are likely to provide additional sensitivity over current stool testing methods.",

In these patients, non-pathogenic amoeba (non-pathogenic zymodemes) including Entamoeba dispar, are likely, as they are indistingushable by light microscopy from pathogenic amoeba. 139 Other non-pathogenic amoeba such as Entamoeba hartmanii and Entamoeba coli have also been commonly identi\u00aeed on stool testing of homosexual HIV-infected men with diarrhoea. 136 It may be expected that colonization, even with nonpathogenic strains, might cause signi\u00aecant disease in immunocompromised patients. Instead, a benign clinical course has been found. A number of symptomatic patients in whom Entamoeba were identi\u00aeed had other potential pathogens, suggesting that a search for other causes is always appropriate in a symptomatic HIVinfected patient with diarrhoea and amoebic cysts. In addition, despite clearance of these protozoa from the stool, treatment has not been shown to reliably cure diarrhoea, suggesting that in most patients these do not represent pathogens (e.g. Entamoeba dispar). It is interesting to note that in the developing world, a higher percentage of asymptomatic infection may be due to pathogenic organisms. Metronidazole (750 mg t.d.s. for 10\u00b114 days) is highly effective for E. histolytica, and relapse is rare. Because metronidazole is not an effective agent for cysts, use of a luminal acting agent to eradicate intestinal colonization is recommended for those with invasive amoebiasis.

Indeed, the mean CD4 lymphocyte count in patients with MAC is 60/mm 2 . 140, 143 Although Mycobacterium tuberculosis can present in an atypical fashion in HIV-infected patients, gastrointestinal involvement remains rare, especially in developed countries. 144 MAC has rarely been reported to involve the oesophagus, biliary tree and colon; small intestinal disease is the most common site of luminal gastrointestinal involvement. 145 The pathogenesis of MAC is believed to be ingestion of mycobacteria with subsequent small intestinal infection, followed by widespread dissemination. 146 Nevertheless, autopsy studies of AIDS patients with MAC bacteremia may fail to identify any foci of disease in up to 30% of patients. 147 The liver and spleen are the most common sites for dissemination. 148 Small bowel involvement is often diffuse. Massive in\u00aeltration of the small bowel, mimicking Whipple's disease, has been described, and may account for the severe malabsorption seen in some patients. 149 Although diarrhoea is common, systemic symptoms and signs of fever and wasting often dominate the clinical presentation. Positive blood cultures establish the diagnosis of disseminated MAC, but does not prove active gastrointestinal disease. In those with suspected disease, blood cultures may be negative, necessitating repetitive cultures, bone marrow biopsy or empirical therapy. The presence of a positive stool culture suggests, but does not prove, gastrointestinal involvement; stool culture positivity is a marker for subsequent disseminated disease. 150, 151 Therapy. Therapy for MAC has improved substantially over the last decade. Previously used multi-drug regimens were poorly tolerated, associated with signi-\u00aecant side-effects, and had low ef\u00aecacy. 152 More recently, dual therapy with clarithromycin and ethambutol has been shown to reduce bacterial load and provide clinical bene\u00aet. 153 In general, single-agent therapy is insuf\u00aecient and frequently leads to resistance. 154 Clarithromycin appears to be the most effective single agent; ethambutol is also effective. 154, 155 A combination of rifabutin, ethambutol and clarithromycin was shown to be superior to rifampin, ethambutol, clofazamine and cipro\u00afoxacin; 155 bacteremia was cleared at 1 month in 78% of those receiving three drugs as compared to 40% in the fourdrug regimen; survival was also signi\u00aecantly greater with the three-drug regimen (8.6 vs. 5.2 months, respectively). Relapse at 16 weeks was not seen in the three-drug group, suggesting the absence of resistance. Lifelong therapy is often given if a patient responds, because clearance of bacteria does not prove cure, as complete eradication is probably never achieved. Depending on the clinical setting, there may be initial concern over the possibility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in some patients. Multidrug regimens are effective for M. tuberculosis with microbiological and clinical cure observed at 9 months, provided drug resistance is not present; 156 long-term therapy is thus unnecessary.",

Placebo-controlled trials of this agent found a reduction in incidence of bacteremia and improvement in some clinical parameters, but no differences in survival. 157 Based on this evidence, rifabutin was recommended for AIDS patients with CD4 count < 50/mm 3 . 158 More recently, prophylaxis trials have compared clarithromycin to placebo, 159 and azithromycin to rifabutin vs. the combination of these two agents. 160 These studies show clarithromycin to be highly effective as monotherapy with a 6 month incidence of infection of 6% as compared to 16% for placebo. 159 Of the 19 patients developing infection, 11 (58%) had clarithromycin-resistant strains. In the other study, 160 azithromycin was found to be superior to rifabutin, with the combination regimen most effective. However, side-effects were signi\u00aecantly more common with the multidrug regimen (15.3% vs. 6% vs. 2.3%). As with the previous study, 159 patients developing clinical disease while on azithromycin had developed in vitro resistance. These studies in combination suggest that the preferred therapy for prophylaxis should consist of a macrolide antibiotic, probably clarithromycin 500 mg b.d. Because of side-effects and drug interactions with dual therapy including rifabutin, monotherapy is appropriate for prophylaxis. Nevertheless, resistance commonly develops.",

            "text": "Unusual presentations of common bacterial diseases became apparent early in the AIDS epidemic where Salmonella sp. 161 or Campylobacter sp. bacteremia 162 were reported as initial manifestations of AIDS. Bacteria were frequently identi\u00aeed in earlier studies of diarrhoea in HIV-infected patients. 163, 164 Currently, the prevalence of these infections as causes of diarrhoea are not well known, although are probably lower than in the past given the use of trimethoprim\u00b1sulphamethoxazole for prophylaxis. The spectrum of bacterial causes of diarrhoea and clinical presentation in AIDS are similar to immunocompetent patients. Blood and/or stool cultures are usually diagnostic; blood cultures may be positive when stool cultures are negative. 165 Colitis may be identi\u00aeed by\u00afexible sigmoidoscopy; mucosal biopsies should be performed in severely immunocompromised patients as CMV colitis may appear endoscopically similar. The role of enteroadherent E. coli as a cause of diarrhoea is unknown. 166 Clostridium dif\u00aecile colitis is an important cause of diarrhoea in HIV-infected patients. A high frequency of C. dif\u00aecile colitis would be anticipated in these patients, given the prevalence of antibiotic use and frequent hospitalizations\u00d0both factors which have been linked to C. dif\u00aecile disease. 167, 168 In the appropriate clinical setting, detection of C. dif\u00aecile toxin is diagnostic. Faecal leucocytes are usually present (60%) and are an important clue to the diagnosis. 168 Flexible sigmoidoscopy is warranted in the patient in whom the disease is suspected but stool toxin is negative. The clinical presentation and response to therapy of C. dif\u00aecile colitis are no different in HIV-infected as compared to uninfected patients. 169 Metronidazole, which can be administered either orally or intravenously, represents \u00aerst line therapy. Vancomycin should be reserved for those patients with contraindication to or failure with metronidazole or when the disease is lifethreatening; this agent is only effective when administered orally. Clinical cure can be obtained in essentially all patients. The relapse rate appears to be similar in HIV-infected as compared to uninfected patients. 169 ",

            "text": "An important entity not clearly linked to a speci\u00aec infection is the HIV-associated idiopathic oesophageal ulcer (IEU). These lesions can present at the time of seroconversion, 170 although typically occur when im-munode\u00aeciency is severe; the median CD4 count in these patients is <50/mm 3 . 80 Several studies have identi\u00aeed HIV-infected in\u00afammatory cells in the ulcer base of these lesions, suggesting an aetiological role for HIV. 171, 172 However, HIV has not been identi\u00aeed in oesophageal squamous mucosa but rather in in\u00afammatory cells, and has been found in HIV-infected patients with oesophageal diseases other than IEU. 173, 174 These lesions present similarly to ulcerative oesophagitis from other causes; severe odynophagia is almost uniformly present. IEU are almost as common as CMV oesophagitis in patients with AIDS, comprising %40% of oesophageal ulcers in these patients. 81 The diagnosis is one of exclusion; CMV oesophagitis and IEU are indistinguishable clinically, radiographically and endoscopically. 175 Therapy. Treatment of HIV-associated IEU is rewarding. Prospective studies have documented healing rates of over 90% with oral corticosteroids. 176 The regimen most commonly employed is prednisone 40 mg/day decreasing to 10 mg/week for a 1 month treatment course. 176 Shorter courses of therapy may be effective for smaller ulcers. Although bene\u00aecial, intralesional injection of corticosteroids should be considered as second line therapy. 172 The side-effects of corticosteroids are well recognized; patients with AIDS may be more likely to develop CMV disease while on therapy. 177 Because oropharyngeal and/or oesophageal candidiasis may complicate steroid use and confuse the therapeutic response, we routinely use short courses of azole therapy with prednisone. The response to corticosteroids is rapid, with most patients experiencing signi\u00aecant pain relief within days. 176 Although not as well studied, thalidomide also appears to be highly effective for IEU. 178, 179 Its mechanism of action is unknown, but it has been suggested that it is an inhibitor of tumour necrosis factor-a production. 180 In doses of 200\u00b1 300 mg/day, thalidomide has been documented to result in a clinical response rate and endoscopic cure in over 90% of treated patients. 178, 179 Thalidomide is well tolerated, with the main side-effect being somnolence; administration of the drug at bedtime tends to overcome this. Peripheral neuropathy and skin rash have also been seen. 181 The major fear with thalidomide is the inadvertent use in the \u00aerst trimester of pregnancy, which consistently results in severe birth defects. Thus, most would not use this agent in women of child-bearing age, unless the patient is surgically sterile. Both prednisone and thalidomide are similarly effective for oropharyngeal apthous ulcerations. The relapse rate of IEU is %40\u00b150% regardless of therapy. 81, 176 SYMPTOMATIC THERAPY OF DIARRHOEA For patients in whom antimicrobial therapy is ineffective or no speci\u00aec cause for diarrhoea is found, symptomatic therapy will be necessary. When the diarrhoea is mild, bulking agents, bismuth or Kaopectate may provide relief. With more severe diarrhoea, medications to reduce intestinal transit are required. We routinely use diphenoxylate (Lomotil) in doses up to 10 tablets/day. Larger doses may cause anticholinergic side-effects, because diphenoxylate is combined with atropine in Lomotil. 182 Despite the potential for abuse, narcotic agents are also highly effective. In patients with severe diarrhoea, tincture of opium (paregoric) is very effective. It is usually provided with a dropper which provides a morphine concentration of 0.4 mg/mL. The normal dose is 5\u00b110 mL/day in divided doses, and the dose can be titrated up to 20 mL/day. Some patients may experience somnolence or abdominal cramps; these tend to dissipate over time. Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, is an antisecretory agent with a variety of inhibitory functions throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Initial studies in patients with AIDS found this drug to provide effective control of diarrhoea in %50%. 183\u00b1185 However, a large randomized placebo-controlled trial failed to demonstrate ef\u00aecacy of this agent in patients with and without identi\u00aeable pathogens. 186 The drug is given subcutaneously in doses of 50\u00b1100 lg t.d.s. Side-effects include decreased biliary motility (gallstones), diabetes and steatorrhea, the latter of which may potentially exacerbate diarrhoea. Although the drug has not been clearly proved to be effective, its use may be attempted in patients with severe diarrhoea requiring hospitalization (e.g. cryptosporidia). We consider a clinical response to be a reduction in stool frequency/volume of at least 50%.",
