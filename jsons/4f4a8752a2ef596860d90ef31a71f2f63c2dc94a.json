Viral respiratory infections are found in association with asthma exacerbations [1, 2] . The infections associated with these wheezing events are multiple and include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, coronavirus and other viruses as well as typical and atypical bacteria [3] . Previous studies have shown differences in the bronchoalveolar cytokine profiles between non-asthmatic and asthmatic patients [4] . Several cytokines have been described to play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma, such as IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-4, IL-5 and chemokines (MCP-1: monocyte chemoattract protein-1; RANTES: regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) [2] . In this regard, TNF-a induces pro-inflammatory events, apoptosis and emphysema in lung tissues [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . IL-1 induces releases other cytokines and chemokines and eosinophil accumulation producing neutrophilic inflammation in respiratory disorders [10] [11] [12] [13] . In addition, IL-1b can induce increased production of IL-4 and IL-5 that increase IgE production [14, 15] involved in allergic airway inflammation [16] [17] [18] [19] . MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattract protein-1) and RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) are important in leucocyte recruitment to lung tissues during lung inflammatory events [1, 2, 20, 21] . However, circulating cytokine response after viral or bacterial respiratory infections in asthmatic and non-asthmatic status has been little studied. Increased circulating blood levels of several cytokines during viral respiratory tract infection have been reported [2] . These cytokines may represent inflammatory markers with different profiles in asthmatic and non-asthmatic patients. In addition to the asthmatic background, the infection type (viral or bacterial) and the site of respiratory infection (upper or lower) could be important to define the circulating cytokine profile. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe changes in the level of several inflammatory (IL-1b, TNFa) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) cytokines and chemokines (MCP-1 and RANTES) in the systemic circulation during acute viral or bacterial infections in patients with asthmatic or non-asthmatic background and their relationship with the respiratory infection site (upper and lower).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 78, "end": 81, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 164, "end": 167, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 168, "end": 170, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 407, "end": 410, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 539, "end": 542, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 799, "end": 802, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 900, "end": 903, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 904, "end": 907, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 908, "end": 911, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 912, "end": 915, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 916, "end": 919, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1068, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1073, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1078, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1083, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1187, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1188, "end": 1191, "text": "15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1233, "end": 1237, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1242, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1247, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1252, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1459, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1462, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1463, "end": 1466, "text": "20,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1467, "end": 1470, "text": "21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1739, "end": 1742, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Patients. The study population was drawn from outpatient clinics. Male and female patients (n = 43) presenting clinical diagnosis of acute respiratory infection (ARI) were studied ( Table 1 ). The inclusion criteria were those individuals who had at least one respiratory symptom, such as cough, wheeze, running nose or sneeze, and who were suspected by a professional physician to have respiratory infection. Patients with previous diagnosis of asthma according to the criteria of the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Program [22] , but without asthma manifestation (only asthma background), were selected and classified as asthmatic patients in this study (n = 14). Patients without antecedents of asthma (no asthmatic background) were classified as non-asthmatic patients (n = 29). No patients were treated with antibiotics, antiallergic or steroid drugs when blood samples were obtained. Patients with asthmatic background did not present asthma manifestations at least one month previous to the moment of blood sample obtaining. Suggestive clinical and X-rays findings were used for the diagnosis of pneumonia (asthmatic: n = 8; non-asthmatic: n = 9) or bronchitis (asthmatic: n = 6; non-asthmatic: n = 20). Pneumonia criteria were as follows: temperature >38\u00b0C, cough with or without sputum, hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain, myalgia, dyspnoea, fatigue, rales, rhonchi, wheezing, bronchial breath sounds, dullness to percussion and gastrointestinal symptoms. Regarding chest radiography, the presence of pleural effusion, lobar consolidation or diffuse infiltrates was observed. The physical examination of patients presenting acute bronchitis showed the presence or absence of fever and tachypnea, cough with or without sputum, wheezing, rhonchi and prolonged expiration. Evidence of lung consolidation was absent. Viral (only the presence of studied viruses: asthmatic: n = 5; nonasthmatic: n = 16), bacterial (only the presence of studied bacteria: asthmatic: n = 4; non-asthmatic: n = 7) and mixed (the presence of both studied bacteria and viruses: asthmatic: n = 5; non-asthmatic: n = 6) infection was confirmed by the presence of the agent in specimens from nasopharynx and bronchoalveolar lavage. This study was performed in 43 patients who were obtained from a patient screen (161 patients). Only patients with confirmed presence of studied micro-organisms in both types of samples were selected. Healthy individuals with similar age (15-72 years) and sex (n = 10) were studied as controls. Controls were individuals without respiratory symptoms, evidence of lung radiography alterations and negative micro-organism results in bronchoscopy and nasal samples. We excluded individuals who had cardiac disease, immunodeficiency and chronic inflammatory disease. In addition, they were negative for studied micro-organisms and had normal levels of IgE, normal chest radiography and non-asthmatic background. Blood samples were obtained from patients at the time when specimens from nasopharynx and bronchoalveolar were obtained. Serum from controls and patients was stored at \u00c070\u00b0C until use.

The source of increased levels of cytokine/chemokines in the patient's circulation after lung infection could involve lung tissues and/or systemic tissues. The respiratory tract is a frequent primary site of microbial infections resulting in the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. During the lung inflammatory events, the alveolar compartmentalization could be lost, allowing the passage of released cytokines to the bloodstream by any other organ to the pulmonary endothelium or inversely from the lung to the bloodstream.

These cytokines stimulate B-lymphocytes to produce IgE [14, 15] and increase allergic airway inflammation [16] [17] [18] . Increased levels of circulating chemokines found in asthmatic patients could reflect lung chemokine production that may be important in leucocyte recruitment to lung tissues. RANTES is involved in the chemoattraction of eosinophils, monocytes and T-lymphocytes, and therefore, it has high relevance in asthma [21] . MCP-1 is involved in the recruitment of regulatory and effector leucocytes (monocytes, lymphocytes and basophils) into tissues [20] . Therefore, chemokines could play an important role in asthma pathogenesis and in ARI.
