Cheetahs have a number of morphological and physiological characteristics that are related to their ability to sprint at high speeds (>70 miles per h) in pursuit of prey [Wrogemann, 1975; Kingdon, 19771 . Because of their swift and elusive character, demographic estimates of wild cheetahs vary considerably, from 1,500 to 25,000 animals [Frame and Frame, 1981; Myers, 1975 Myers, , 1986 Joubert and Mostert, 1975; Eaton, 1974; Hamilton, 19861. Free-ranging cheetahs presently inhabit a broad section of central, eastern, and southern Africa. Although the area of the cheetah's range is vast, population density estimates are rather low (estimated at less than one animal per 6 km2), which has raised the possibility that cheetah density in certain areas is lower than the ecosystem could support [Frame and Frame, 1981; Myers, 19751 . The species has been classified as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and is listed as appendix I of the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species [CITES, 19841. In light of the cheetah's endangered status, as well as its aesthetic appeal to humankind, the species has historically been the object of multiple attempts to propagate in captivity. For reasons that were unclear until recently, however, the cheetah has not been easy to breed. Despite the widespread capture and training of wild cheetahs by Eurasian rulers for several thousand years, there is but a single report of a captive litter (in the palace of Akbar, a fifteenth century Mogul emperor) until the 1950s [Guggisberg, 19751 . The difficulty in breeding cheetahs prompted several conservation initiatives including: 1) the development of the North American Regional Cheetah Studbook in 1983 [Marker, 19831, now in its fourth edition; 2) the inclusion of the species as a target animal of the Species Survival Plan (SSP) of the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums (AAZPA) in 1984; and 3) the establishment of a multidisciplinary research program to provide a biological explanation for the relative difficulty in breeding cheetahs as compared to other felids (lions, tigers, pumas, etc.) . Results of these studies have established the species as a paradigm for understanding the interaction of genetic, reproductive, and epidemiological factors in conservation management of threatened and endangered species [O'Brien et al., 1983; Wildt et al., 1983 Wildt et al., , 1984a O'Brien et al., 1985; Wayne et al., 1986; O'Brien et al., 1986 O'Brien et al., , 1987 Wildt et al., 19871. An important aspect of the description of a species conservation program is the development of a demographic and genetic profile of the captive-bred population. Toward this end, a cheetah studbook for North American zoos was published in 1983 and is updated annually by one of us (L.M.) [Marker, 1983 , 1985a , 19861. In 1988 , an international studbook of the cheetah will be compiled as well. We present here a report on of the progress of acquisition, breeding, and mortality of the captive cheetah in North American facilities from 1871 to 1986. The results suggest that the cheetah breeding program is in a precarious position due to several factors that we believe can be reversed by implementation of a number of coordinate management decisions.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 382, "end": 399, "text": "[Wrogemann, 1975;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 400, "end": 414, "text": "Kingdon, 19771", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 550, "end": 573, "text": "[Frame and Frame, 1981;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 574, "end": 585, "text": "Myers, 1975", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 586, "end": 599, "text": "Myers, , 1986", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 600, "end": 626, "text": "Joubert and Mostert, 1975;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 627, "end": 639, "text": "Eaton, 1974;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 640, "end": 656, "text": "Hamilton, 19861.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1009, "end": 1032, "text": "[Frame and Frame, 1981;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1033, "end": 1045, "text": "Myers, 19751", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1237, "text": "[CITES, 19841.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1750, "end": 1768, "text": "[Guggisberg, 19751", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1935, "end": 1954, "text": "[Marker, 19831, now", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2321, "end": 2349, "text": "(lions, tigers, pumas, etc.)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2572, "end": 2594, "text": "[O'Brien et al., 1983;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2595, "end": 2613, "text": "Wildt et al., 1983", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2614, "end": 2635, "text": "Wildt et al., , 1984a", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2636, "end": 2657, "text": "O'Brien et al., 1985;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2658, "end": 2677, "text": "Wayne et al., 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2678, "end": 2698, "text": "O'Brien et al., 1986", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2699, "end": 2721, "text": "O'Brien et al., , 1987", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2722, "end": 2742, "text": "Wildt et al., 19871.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3030, "end": 3043, "text": "[Marker, 1983", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3044, "end": 3051, "text": ", 1985a", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 3052, "end": 3068, "text": ", 19861.

Examination of this figure shows that the majority of the increase in the captive cheetah population before 1972, when the numbers reached 167, can be attributed to imports. During the 1956-1972 period, there were 305 wild-caught imports and only a few captive births (N = 21). Importation of cheetahs was terminated by the passage of the Endangered Species Act in 1973 (see Fig. 2 ). At about the same time, the captive reproduction of cheetahs increased to a peak of 37 births in 1975, followed by a temporary decline until 1980, after which a high of 41 births in 10 captive litters occurred in 198 1. From 1982 to 1985, the number of births decreased continuously.

As shown in Figure 2 , cheetah mortality gradually increased over the 30-year breeding period, clearly correlating with population growth (Fig. 1) . The timing of death in the cheetah population, however, revealed some marked trends. First, the incidence of infant mortality before age 6 months (Table 2) species [O'Brien et al., 1985; Ralls and Ballou, 1982a,b; Ralls et al., 19791 . The extent of infant mortality varied widely among institutions (0-100%; Table 3 ) and also between years (Table 2) . When the frequency of infant mortality is computed for those cubs born to related parents (inbred), the frequency is 23/56 = 41%. The frequency for cubs born from unrelated parents (noninbred) was 130/361 = 36%. Although the frequency of inbred infant mortality was slightly higher, this difference is not statistically significant (x2 = 0.53; P 2 0.1). We have interpreted the apparent equivalence of survivorship among inbred vs. outbred cheetah litters as a reflection of an ancestral genetic homogenization event that purged large portions of genetic variation from the species [O'Brien et al. 1985, 19871. The age of death of cheetahs recorded in the North American Regional Cheetah Studbook is presented in Figure 5 . Two points are evident from analysis of these data. First, the most vulnerable age is infancy (0-1 month) when the mortality is 10 times the frequency than at any other age. Second, there is a clear demarcation between time of death for wild-caught animals vs. captive-bred animals. The captive-born animals died almost equivalently from age 2 to 10 years if they survived the first 6 months. With few exceptions, wild-caught animals lived to be 12-16 years of age. At face value, this distribution would suggest that once wild cheetahs survive in the field to an age where they can be captured and shipped to the United States, their survivorship is extended nearly 5 years longer than their captive-bred counterparts in U.S. zoos.

As expected, most deaths were attributable to infant mortalities resulting from stillbirths, premature births, congenital defects, infection, mother neglect, or cannibalism (N = 79 individuals; 36.9%). The second most predominant killer was feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a fatal coronavirus disease that killed 39 animals (1 8.2%). All of the FIP diagnoses involved animals that died after 1982 when a major clinical epizootic occurred at Wildlife Safari Park in Oregon [O'Brien et al., 1985; Pfeifer et al., 1983; Evermann et al., 19861 . Although FIP had been reported in other cheetah facilities earlier than 1982 [Van Rensburg and Silkstone, 1984; Horzinek and Osterhaus, 1979; Worley, 19861 , the extent of documentation of the Oregon epizootic alerted the U.S. wildlife veterinary community to the extremes of morbidity that this disease can cause in cheetahs. It is possible that the FIP virus was present earlier in cheetah colonies, but was not recognized before 1982 since the disease is difficult to diagnose. For example, a common complication of FIP is kidney and/or liver complications, which are listed as the next most common cause of mortality in captive cheetahs (combined total of 41 animals [19%] ). It may be significant, however, that many cheetahs that have died of kidney and liver damage are not associated with coronavirus infection [M. Worley, personal communication] .

The breeding program, however, is not self-sustaining, and has shown a marked decline from 1982 to 1985 (Fig. 2) . The captive population has traditionally had a low effective breeding size (less than 15% of the total), and the 1986 population of 193 animals has an N, of 28 animals.

More unusual was the observation of allogeneic skin graft acceptance among unrelated cheetahs, revealing genetic monomorphism at the major histocompatibility complex, an abundantly polymorphic locus in nearly all mammals [O'Brien et al., 19851 . A comparative analysis of cheetah ejaculates revealed a sperm count one-tenth of that observed in domestic cats and an extremely high frequency (71%) of morphological spermatozoa1 abnormalities [Wildt et al., 1983, 19871 . In addition to these phenotypic observations, patterns of skeletal variation also show significant asymmetry of bilateral characters, a phenomenon generally common in inbred animals [Wayne et al., 19861 . The combined genetic, reproductive, and morphological data placed the cheetah in a status reminiscent of deliberately inbred mice or livestock and prompted us to hypothesize that in its recent history the species had probably suffered a demographic contraction or population bottleneck necessarily followed by inbreeding [O'Brien et al., 19871 . Based on the genetic and physiological similarities of the southern and eastern African subspecies, we concluded that the proposed bottleneck was an ancient one, perhaps dating back to the global mammalian extinctions near the end of the Pleistocene over 10,000 years ago.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 155, "end": 195, "text": "[reviewed in O'Brien et al., 1985, 19861", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 416, "end": 438, "text": "[O'Brien et al., 19831", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 662, "end": 684, "text": "[O'Brien et al., 19851", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 881, "end": 907, "text": "[Wildt et al., 1983, 19871", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1112, "text": "[Wayne et al., 19861", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1458, "text": "[O'Brien et al., 19871", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Considering the combined results of the genetics, physiology, structure, and natural history of the captive cheetah populations, there are several recommendations that seem important to improve the demographic patterns. First, outbreeding individuals within the present captive population should be optimized primarily to mask the potentially deleterious physiological effects of inbreeding among cheetahs. This strategy could be extended by the introduction of new animals of different genetic lineages. A particular advantage may be achieved by the inclusion of East African animals into the program, an approach that was apparently successful at Whipsnade ( Table 5 ) . The probability of outbreeding depression [Shields, 19821 is miniscule because the genetic distance between the two subspecies is trivial, 10 times less, for example, than the genetic distance between human racial groups [O'Brien et al., 19871. Second, because the N, may be typically low because of inherent genetic impoverishment, the only way to reverse decline may be to increase the size of the breeding population. Soule et al. [1986] have estimated that in order to have a viable population, a principal aim would be to retain 90% of the endemic genetic variation for over 200 years. Experience with domestic animal breeding has determined that inbreeding depression can be avoided if the rate of inbreeding per generation remains below 1%. This translates into an effective breeding size (N,) of at least 50 animals. If the cheetah's present N, (14.5%) cannot be improved by husbandry, a total population of 340 animals would be required to maintain an effective breeding size of 50. Increasing the captive population could be achieved in some ways that would not impact on the remaining free-ranging populations. The first is to expand the managed captive population to an international studbook, a process actually begun in 1987 with L.M. designated as International Studbook Keeper. Second, inclusion of all captive cheetahs in studbook management should be implemented as well as consideration of recently acquired animals being captured in habitats where cheetahs are legally hunted and trapped, as is the case in Southwest Africa/Namibia [Morsbach, 19871. Finally, increased research on physiology, reproduction, nutrition, genetics, and behavior of captive cheetahs should be encouraged. Although we know much about the cheetah compared to other threatened species, there are many unanswered but approachable questions. A recently drafted master plan developed by the cheetah propagation group of the Species Survival Plan of the AAZPA has listed basic research in reproduction as a primary end of the SSP. This plan has defined research goals in the related fields of reproduction, nutrition [Setchell et al., 19871, behavior, genetics, husbandry [Grisham, 19881, pathology [Gosselin et al., 19881 , and epidemiology. The anticipated results may provide the key to stabilization of the worldwide captive population with the ultimate end of release of captive-bred animals to suitable natural habitats.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 715, "end": 730, "text": "[Shields, 19821", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 894, "end": 917, "text": "[O'Brien et al., 19871.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1113, "text": "[1986]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2225, "end": 2242, "text": "[Morsbach, 19871.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2781, "end": 2886, "text": "[Setchell et al., 19871, behavior, genetics, husbandry [Grisham, 19881, pathology [Gosselin et al., 19881", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 661, "end": 668, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Captive propagation at the National Zoological Gardens of South Africa", "authors": [{"first": "D", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Brand", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1980, "venue": "INTERNA-TIONAL ZOOLOGICAL YEARBOOK", "volume": "20", "issn": "", "pages": "107--112", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, Part of the Endangered Species Act.
