As the samples investigated have been taken from the Upper Bunter and the Lower Muschelkalk it seems useful to treat briefly the problems about the boundaries between Middle Bunter and Upper Bunter and between Upper Bunter and Muschc1kalk. In the Netherlands one usually starts the Upper Bunter with the Rot salt deposits. Also BOICK (1959) takes this view with regard to his subdivision of the German Bunter. The Rot is considered identical with the Upper Bunter and can be divided into the Rot salinar and the younger Rot pelites. The underlying Solling Group belongs to the Middle Bunter. Another boundary has been proposed by TRUSHEIM (1963) . Both the Solling and the Rot belong to the Upper Bunter; so the latter cannot be considered identical with the Rot. The boundary between the upper part of the Middle Bunter, the Hardegsen Group, and the Solling Group is marked by an uncomformity (\"H-Diskordanz\") whose occurrence has been demonstrated from the Dutch-German border up to Thiiringen and which can be correlated with the well-known fossil land surface in southern Germany. It may be regarded as the most important hiatus within the Bunter, if not within the whole German Triassic (TRUSHEIM 1963, figs. 2, 8) . Because of the comparatively small regional extension of the Rot salinar we prefer the \"H-Diskordanz\" as a criterion for the boundary between the Middle Bunter and the Upper Bunter. Unlike the interpretation by the K.N.Z. we consider the red sandy shales underlying the salt deposits to be the Upper Bunter (Solling Group; compare Table 1) .",

Remarks and comparisons: Some spores considered as Calamaspora have been found in sample 34. Because of the few specimens found and the bad preservation it has been impossible to compare our forms with the numerous species of Calamaspora mentioned in the palynological literature. Calamaspora sp. possesses an irrigular, but fundamentally circular outline; diameter approx. 60 ft. Exine smooth with fine infrastructure; thickness approx. 1 ft. Length of the Y-mark rays approx. 4/5 of the spore radius; usually the sutures are widely opened. Strongly folded. Calamaspora sp. differs from Calamaspora nathorstii (Halle 1906) Klaus 1960 , which is important to Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic stratigraphy, by its bigger size and its thicker exine.",

However Apiculatisporites includes megaspores (compare POTONIE 1956, p. 30) ; the usage of American authors considering apiculate forms to Punctatisporites is objectionable; the position of Spinososporites is discussed by POTONIE (1958, p. 21) ; the latter author also dealt with the relation Apiculatasporites-Planisporites (POTONIE 1960, p. 21 ). Yet LESCHIK (1956a) considers Apiculatasporites alete; because of the trilete type species this is not permissible.

Recently this subject was discussed again by BHARADWA] and SINGH (1964) ; they do not find any important differences. Because of differences existing in equatorial flattened specimens, however, we want to follow Klaus. In equatorial view Aratrisporites shows a slightly concave proximal outline (KLAUS 1960, t. 44, f. 41) ; Saturnisporites differs by a straight to slightly convex outline (Plate XIII, fig. 4 ). These differences suggest a different shape of the spores and justify a separation. We are not convinced of the zonal character of the genus.",

Differences in the projection of the infrabaculate proximal exine cause a seeming ridge, split by a seeming crack (Fig. l7e) . Also the unthickened distal exine is sensitive to folding (Fig. 17b) . Specimens in polar view without any folding are very rare (Fig. l7c) . Specimens in equatorial view show clearly the thickened proximal exine and the elliptical outline (Fig. 17d) . Because of the original ellipsoid shape the pollen grains do not show any preference for their position during sedimentation; consequently they can be fossilized in diverging positions.",

The variation of this species turns out to be very diverging and includes amongst others progressive transitions to the other Triadispora-species (Fig. 22) . This may be an argument for placing these species within the variation of T. crassa, in order to avoid a subjective specific subdivision. For stratigraphical reasons, however, a separation remains desirable (compare p. 326). The variation of the genus Triadispora reminds one of the analogue divergences in the pollen in situ of Ullmannia frumentaria, investigated by GREBE and SCHWEITZER (1962) . A wide variation combined with the occurrence of abnormal forms is also demonstrated within the striate pollen studied by BHARADWA] (1962). Frequently a wide variation of recent coniferal saccate pollen is due to interspecific hybridizing. For example the hybrid Pinus uncinata X Pinus silvestris produces pollen grains possessing both abnormal shapes and varying dimensions compared with the parents (AYTUG 1962).",

He disagrees with Klaus' conception about its fundamental trilete character. In some rare cases faint lines may suggest an V-mark, but probably these are secondary phenomena. Furthermore the species possesses the characteristic thickened bladder base, already 352 H. VISSCHER reported by JANSONIUS (1962) . Because of the alete character the Canadian species cannot be placed within the genus Triadispora.

Although trisaccate the species has been placed within a bisaccate genus. By creating a new trisaccate genus the relation with T. crassa would not be clear.

The latter fact has been the argument for placing Angustisulcites, together with Illinites, within the Aletestriatiti nov. subinfraturma.

Remarks and comparisons: By many authors (GREBE 1957; KLAUS 1960; BHARADWA] 1962; ]ANSONIUS 1962; HART 1964; FREUDENTHAL 1964) the type species of Lunatisporites Leschik 1956a and Taeniaesporites Leschik 1956a (respectively Lunatisporites acutus Leschik 1956a and Taeniaesporites kraeuseli Leschik 1956a are considered identical; in this case both genera have to be united. We agree with this conception. However, in the literature there is no unanimity about the question of taxonomical priority, which is given to Lunatisporites as well to Taeniaesporites. LESCHIK (1956a) described both genera in the same paper; Lunatisporites at p. 56, Taeniaesporites at p. 58. The descriptions are poor and insufficient. GREBE (1957) restudied the type species and did not notice any important differences. However, she united both genera with Lueckisporites Potonie & Klaus 1954 . LESCHIK (1959 disagrees with Grebe's concept about the nature of the semi-lunar dark area on the central body of Lunatisporites; this should be a morphological feature instead of an optical effect. KLAUS (1960) followed GREBE (1957) . BHARADWA] (Febr. 1962) states that there are no differences between the two genera. On account of \"page priority\" he considers Taeniae-sporites a synonym of Lunatisporites Leschik 1956a emend. Bharadwaj 1962 ANSONIUS (April 1962) stated the same concept. But because of the better preserved holotype he gives priority to Taeniaesporites Leschik 1956a emend. ]ansonius 1962 . KLAUS (1963a disagrees, since according to the \"page priority\" Lunatisporites should have been chosen. He appeals to LESCHIK (1959) in order to maintain a separation between Lunatisporites and Taeniaesporites Leschik 1956a emend. Klaus 1963a . HART (1964 also considers the type species identical, but next he argues inconsistently by maintaining Taeniaesporites without mentioning Lunatispontes as a synonym. The latter genus can be found in the list of synonyms of the genus Protohaploxypinus Samoilovich 1953 emend. Hart 1964 . FREUDENTHAL (1964 follows ]ANSONIUS (1962) . ]ansonius has been perfectly correct and logical in choosing Taeniaesporites. Bharadwaj was guided by the \"page priority\" when he chose Lunatisporites. On the other hand, this \"page priority\" has been the very motive of KLAUS (1963a) to separate the genera. However, the idea of \"page priority\" is not provided by the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Art. 51 is very plain when it states: \" ... The author who first unites taxa bearing names or epithets of the same date has the right to choose one of them, and his choice must be followed\" .",

Comparison: Striatoabietites differs from Tubantiapollenites n. gen. by the absence of a reduced trilete (roof-shaped) or monolete (straight) mark in the proximal intexine. Striatoabietites aytugii n. sp. Remarks and comparisons: Usually the shape is faintly diploxylonoid but occasionally it may become more pronounced. S. aytugii differs from T ubantiapollenites balmei (Klaus 1964) nov. comb. by the absence of a (reduced) trilete or monolete mark in the proximal intexine. Diagnosis: See diagnosis of Taeniaesporites Leschik 1956a emend. KLAUS 1963a (KLAUS 1963a . This excellent diagnosis can serve without restrictions as a description of a new striate genus, which includes among others all the forms recognized by KLAUS (1963a). Since species of Taeniaepollenites n. gen. were mostly placed within the genus Taeniaesporites Leschik 1956a and since the latter genus has to be considered a synonym of Lunatisporites Leschik 1956a emend Bharadwaj 1962 , it seems useful to check the concepts about the intexinal V-mark within these genera. LESCHIK (1956a) creates both Lunatisporites and Taeniaesporites, not mentioning the existence of an V-mark. Also the illustrations do not show a tetrad mark. However, the genera are placed within the Disacciatriletes.",

Protosacculina jansonii Freudenthal 1964 may be considered conspecific with this species; we restudied the holotype but could not demonstrate the intexinal mark with certainty. To propose a new combination seems incorrect, because in that case\" Tubantiapollenites jansonii\" should be based on a holotype without the characteristic tetrad mark. T. schulzii differs from Tubantiapollenites balmei (Klaus 1964) nov. comb. by its circular equator. Tubantiapollenites striatitoides n. sp. possesses small haploxylonoid sacci and a smaller number of taeniae. Remarks and comparisons: A generic differentiation of monocolpate pollen grains is hampered by the few characteristics which can be used in describing the species; this is due to the relatively simple shape. So provisionally it seems more reasonable to use the genus Cycadopites in a very broad sense (compare e.g. jANSONIUS 1962). Even the relation with Monosulcites (Cookson 1947) ex Couper 1953 is not clear; within the variation of a species both Cycadopites-like specimens and forms corresponding to the description of Monosulcites are found.",

Other data from the Rot is given by SCHULZ (1965) and by REINHARDT and SCHMITZ (1965) . An important stratigraphic diagram is published by KLAUS (1965) . Finally, I ought to mention two papers by CLARKE (1965a, b) on Keuper and Permian palynology, respectively.",
