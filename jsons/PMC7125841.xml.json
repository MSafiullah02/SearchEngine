            "text": "Mathematical models describing the population dynamics of infectious diseases have been playing an important role in a better understanding of epidemiological patterns and disease control for a long time. In order to predict the spread of infectious disease among regions, many epidemic models have been proposed and analyzed in recent years (see [1], [2], [3], [4]). However, most of the literature researched on epidemic systems (see [5], [6], [7], [8]) assumes that the disease incubation is negligible which causes that, once infected, each susceptible individual (in class S) becomes infectious instantaneously (in class I) and later recovers (in class R) with a permanent or temporary acquired immunity. The model based on these assumptions is customarily called an SIR (susceptible-infectious-recovered) or SIRS (susceptible- infectious-recovered-susceptible) system (see [9], [10]). Many diseases such as measles, severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) and so on, however, incubate inside the hosts for a period of time before the hosts become infectious. So the systems that are more general than SIR or SIRS types need to be studied to investigate the role of incubation in disease transmission. We may assume that a susceptible individual first goes through a latent period (and said to become exposed or in the class E) after infection before becoming infectious. Thus the resulting models are of SEIR (susceptible- exposed-infectious-recovered) or SEIRS (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-susceptible) types, respectively, depending on whether the acquired immunity is permanent or not. Many researchers have studied the stability, bifurcation or chaos behavior of SEIR or SEIRS epidemic systems (see [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]). Michael et al. [11] study the global stability of an SEIR epidemic system in the interior of the feasible region. Greenhalgh [17] discusses Hopf bifurcation in models of SEIRS type with density dependent contact and death rates. In addition, some literature on the SEIR-type age-independent epidemic systems has been investigated by many authors (see [15], [17], [18]) and their threshold theorems are well obtained.",

Although many epidemic systems can be described by differential and algebraic equations (see [2], [13], [16], [23]), they are studied by reducing the dimension of epidemic models to differential systems and the dynamical behaviors of the whole systems are not better described. By reducing the dimension of an SEIR epidemic system via substituted algebraic constraint into differential equations and using the methods of reconstructed phase and correlation dimension, Olsen and Schaffer [13] studied the system described by differential equations that is chaos with a degree of seasonality \u03b21=0.28. However, we can find more complex dynamical behaviors if the SEIR epidemic system is described by differential and algebraic equations via an analysis of the whole system. The systemic parameters in this paper are same as [13]. In particular, the system is hyperchaotic when systemic parameter \u03b21=0.28 in this paper. Some authors study biologic systems based on seasonal forcing. Kamo and Sasaki [24] discuss dynamical behaviors of a multi-strain SIR epidemiological model with seasonal forcing in the transmission rate. Broer et al. [25] studied the dynamics of a predator-prey model with seasonal forcing.",

In particular, the systems (1.1) are normal systems if rank[\u039e(t)]=n. Some authors have discussed chaotic dynamical behavior and chaotic control based on differential and algebraic systems.

The contribution of this paper can be divided into three main parts. In the first part, an SEIR epidemic system with seasonal forcing in transmission rate, which is a new form of differential and algebraic system, is modeled. We discuss the cases of only one varying parameter, two varying parameters and three varying parameters, respectively. For the case of one varying parameter, the periodic, chaotic and hyperchaotic dynamical behaviors of the system are analyzed via the bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponent spectrum diagram and Poincare section. For the cases of two and three varying parameters, the dynamical behaviors of the system are investigated by using Lyapunov diagrams. In the second part, for the hyperchaotic dynamical behavior of the system, we design a tracking controller such that the infectious trajectory of the system tracks an ideal state id(t)=0. In the last part, the case for the degree of seasonality \u03b21=0 is studied. Taking isolation control, we reach the aim of elimination of the disease, and it is easy to implement in real life.",

Hereby, the projections of hyperchaotic attractor on a phase plane are of more complicated fold and tensible trajectories.

We consider three cases: only one varying parameter, two varying parameters and three varying parameters. For the case of only one varying parameter, we analyze the dynamics of the system by using the bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponent spectrum diagram and Poincare section. For the cases of two and three varying parameters, a Lapunov diagram is applied in the analysis of dynamical behaviors. Furthermore, for the hyperchaotic dynamical behavior of the system, we design a tracking controller such that the disease gradually disappears. In particular, we discuss the stability and the transcritical bifurcation for the degree of seasonality \u03b21=0. The disease is eliminated by taking isolation control which is an effective measure. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illuminate the proposed control methods.",
