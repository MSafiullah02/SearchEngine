However, this hormone is more than a simple marker of stress levels\u2014it is necessary for the correct functioning of almost every part of the body. Excesses or deficiencies of this crucial hormone also lead to various physical symptoms and disease states [1]. Although cortisol is not essential for life per se, it helps an organism to cope more efficiently with its environment with particular metabolic actions on glucose production and protein and fat catabolism. Nevertheless, loss or profound diminishment of cortisol secretion leads to a state of abnormal metabolism and an inability to deal with stressors, which, if untreated, may be fatal [1, 2].",

Cortisol levels in normal individuals are highest in the early morning at around 8 a.m. and are lowest just after midnight. This early morning dip in cortisol level often corresponds to increased symptoms of inflammatory diseases or other pathologies in man [3]. Overlaid upon this diurnal variation is the pulsatile nature of cortisol release under the control of local and central \u2018clocks\u2019 [4]. By mimicking this pulsatile cortisol release, it is hoped to reduce the detrimental side effects of exogenous corticosteroids whilst enhancing their anti-inflammatory properties [4, 5].",

This is particularly evident when they are administered at pharmacological doses but is also important in controlling normal immune responses. As a consequence, corticosteroids are widely used as drugs to treat many different inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatic diseases [e.g., rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)], inflammatory diseases of the upper airways (rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis), pulmonary inflammatory diseases [bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, interstitial lung diseases (such as sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonias, idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonias, idiopathic fibrosing interstitial pneumonias)], inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis), infections (including tuberculosis), inflammatory skin diseases (e.g., psoriasis, atopic dermatitis) and kidney diseases (e.g., glomerulonephritis). Corticosteroids may also be used in organ transplantation to reduce the chance of rejection (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-10811-3_32). Thus, although the early effect of cortisol is to stimulate the immune system, cortisol and synthetic corticosteroids predominantly repress the inflammatory response by decreasing the activity and production of immunomodulatory and inflammatory cells.",

Seven days later the patient was able to walk to the shops for the first time in years.

The specific characteristics of the INFLAMMATORY SYSTEM and the inflammatory response in each disease and the site of inflammation differ, but both involve the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells and changes in the structural cells of the target organ. All are characterised by an increased expression of many INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, enzymes, receptors and ADHESION MOLECULES. The increased expression of these proteins is the result of enhanced gene transcription since many of the genes are not expressed in normal cells but are induced in a cell-specific manner during the inflammatory process [7].",

The basic structure of the A ring is a 1\u03b1, 2\u03b2-half-chair, whatever the substitutions. Rings B and C are semi-rigid chairs with minimal structural influence by substituent groups. In contrast, the shape of the D-ring depends on the nature and environment of the substituent groups. Modern corticosteroids such as prednisone, prednisolone, fluticasone, budesonide, dexamethasone and deflazacort are based on the cortisol (hydrocortisone) structure with modification to enhance the anti-inflammatory effects such as insertion of a C=C double bond at C1,C2 or by the introduction of 6\u03b1-fluoro, 6\u03b1-methyl and 9\u03b1-fluoro and/or further substitutions with \u03b1-hydroxyl, \u03b1-methyl or \u03b2-methyl at the 16 position, for example, in dexamethasone (Fig. 32.2) [8, 9]. Reduced binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor is achieved by insertion of the C=C double bond at C1,C2, and lipophilic substituents suchas 21\u03b1-esters attached to the D-ring increase glucocorticoid receptor (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1; NR3C1; GR) binding and enhance topical deposition and hepatic metabolism. These substitutions are seen with budesonide and fluticasone two of the most commonly used inhaled corticosteroids [8, 9]. Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) is a prodrug of the active form, beclomethasone (beclomethasone-17-monopropionate, BMP). Ciclesonide is a prodrug that is enzymatically hydrolysed, by esterase enzymes of the airways, to a pharmacologically active metabolite, C21-desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (also termed des-ciclesonide or RM1). The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of GR has a pocket on the floor of the binding cleft that lies beneath the C17 residue of the steroid backbone. The degree of occupancy of this pocket affects the affinity, duration of action and side effect profile of ligands, and computational chemistry can design drugs with improved clinical characteristics including those without a steroid backbone to improvesafety [10].",

The latter class is able to modulate the activity of a GR agonist and/or may not classically bind the GR LBD. SEGRMs were expected to present the same or better efficacy compared to classical corticosteroids but cause minimal side effects. SEGRAs and SEGRMs are collectively denominated SEGRAMs (selective glucocorticoid receptor agonists and modulators) [11]. Although this transrepression vs transactivation concept has been proved to be too simplistic, the SEGRAMs have been helpful in elucidating various molecular actions of the glucocorticoid receptor [11]. The exact structural and lipophilic requirements to optimisecorticosteroid pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to separate their anti-inflammatory efficacy from their side effects are still unclear, but corticosteroids with improved clinical characteristics are likely to be synthesised as our knowledge in this area increases.",

The glucocorticoid receptors [GRs or nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1 (NR3C1)] are transcription factors belonging to the superfamily of nuclear receptors that are localised to the cytoplasm of target cells. GRs are expressed in almost all cell types, and their density varies from 200 to 30,000 per cell [9, 12] with an affinity for cortisol of ~30 nM, which falls within the normal range for plasma concentrations of free hormone. The human GR gene is located on the long arm of the chromosome 5 and expresses two major mRNAs variants, termed GRa (previously GR\u03b1) and GRb (GR\u03b2). The human GRa mRNA further expresses multiple isoforms [named GRa-A (classic form), GRa-B, GRa-C1, GRa-C2, GRa-C3, GRa-D1, GRa-D2 and GRa-D3]. All human GRa isoforms translocate into the nucleus in response to ligand, while they are differentially distributed in the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus in the absence of ligand. GRa-B and GRa-C1 possess transcriptional activities similar to that of GRa-A, whereas GRa-C2 and GRa-C3 isoforms have stronger transcriptional activities, while GRa-D1, GRa-D2 and GRa-D3 demonstrate weaker activities [9, 12\u201315].",

In addition, cells with sumoylation-deficient FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) fail to interact with Hsp90 and GR, thus facilitating the recruitment of the closely related protein, FKBP52, which enhances GR transcriptional activity [9, 24\u201326].

Combining DNase I accessibility assays with chromatin immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing, the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1) was identified as a major partner for productive GR-chromatin interactions. This highlighted the critical role for AP-1 in regulating GR-mediated transcription and recruitment to co-regulatory elements. Indeed, the baseline chromatin accessibility of GR recruitment to GREs is dependent on AP-1 binding. This may account for the importance of AP-1 and its components such as c-Jun in gene regulatory networks that distinguish asthmatic subjects who respond poorly to corticosteroids [32].",

In general, corticosteroids substantially reduce mast cell-/eosinophil-/lymphocyte-driven processes while leaving unaltered, or even augmenting, neutrophil-mediated processes [9, 15, 43\u201345]. For example, corticosteroids may enhance neutrophil function as a result of increased leukotriene B4 and superoxide anion production, in addition to inhibiting their apoptosis [44]. GCs modulate inflammatory cell survival, inducing apoptosis in T and B lymphocytes and eosinophils while delaying constitutive neutrophil apoptosis and promoting non-inflammatory phagocytosis of apoptotic cell targets, a process important for the successful resolution of inflammation [45, 46]. Corticosteroids in autoimmune diseases decrease the cell and tissue damage mediated by T cellsand autoantibodies and immunocomplexes. Interestingly in allergic diseases, corticosteroids reduce the number of mast cells within the inflamed tissue; however, they do not appear to inhibit mediator release from these cells [9, 15, 43, 44]. Treatment with topical corticosteroids also reduces the number of activated T lymphocytes (CD25+ and HLA-DR+) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and peripheral blood from asthmatic patients [47].",

In addition to their suppressive effects on inflammatory cells, corticosteroids may also decrease endothelial permeability and inhibit plasma exudation and/or leucocyte transendothelial migration in most tissues [9, 15]. Inflammation drives angiogenesis by direct and indirect mechanisms, promoting endothelial proliferation, migration and vessel sprouting, but also by mediating extracellular matrix remodelling andrelease of sequestered growth factors and recruitment of proangiogenic leucocyte subsets. By facilitating greater infiltration of leucocytes and plasma proteins into inflamed tissues, angiogenesis can also propagate chronic inflammation [49], and high doses of topical systemic corticosteroids may reduce both neo-angiogenesis and the increased blood flow present at sites of inflammation [9, 15]. At sites of acute and/or chronic mucosal inflammation, there is often an increased secretion of the major secretory mucins (MUC5AC and MUC5B). The effect of the glucocorticoids on the expression of these mucins is still quite controversialand may be cell- and tissue-type dependent [50].",

Despite the wide pleiotropy (multiple actions) and redundancy that exists in the cytokine and chemokine families, and the subsequent inability to ascribe precise roles to most of these molecules in inflammatory disease pathogenesis, it is clear that these proteins are important mediators in chronic inflammation (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-10811-3_5). The development of TUMOUR NECROSIS FACTOR-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and INTERLEUKIN (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23 antagonists has provided evidence that, in many inflammatory bowel, rheumatic and skin diseases, these mediators plays a key driving role in inflammation, despite different clinical relevance of each inflammatory mediator in different tissues and diseases [53, 54] (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-10811-3_33). This does not appear to be the case with all inflammatory diseases, however [9, 15, 51, 52]. Interestingly, corticosteroids can also enhance the expression of keyanti-inflammatory molecules such as IL-10 and IL-1ra in some inflammatory diseases but again not all [9, 15]. For example, corticosteroids increase the production of IL-10, but not IL-1ra, at sites of inflammation in asthma [9, 15].",

Leukotrienes, particularly cysteinyl leukotrienes, are thought to play a key role in some chronic and acute inflammatory diseases but do not appear to be major targets for corticosteroids that are unable to block leukotriene biosynthesis and their release [55]. However, corticosteroids in vitro accelerateLTC4 catabolism by inducing the activity of a LTC4-degrading enzyme, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-related enzyme (\u03b3-GTPRE) [56]. Analysis of serum from patients with increasing severity of asthma identified 15 metabolites that were significantly altered in asthma although some such as dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, cortisone, cortisol, prolylhydroxyproline, pipecolate and N-palmitoyltaurine correlated significantly with ICS and oral corticosteroid use. In contrast, oleoylethanolamide increased with asthma severity independently of steroid treatment. Overall, the data indicated that asthma was characterised by a systemic metabolic shift according to disease severity and that corticosteroid treatment significantly affectsmetabolism [57].",

Overexpression of HDAC2, but not HDAC1, improves corticosteroid sensitivity in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) macrophages from stable COPD patients [23] through a mechanism that involves the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-\u03b4 pathway [9, 15]. Sub-bronchodilator low doses of theophylline, at concentrations that do not inhibit phosphodiesterase (PDE)4 activity, can enhance HDAC2 activity in vitro, and functionally this enhances glucocorticoid effects. Combined theophylline and ICS treatment improves lung function and sputum neutrophilia in stable COPD patients and lung function in smoking asthmatics [9, 15]. This effect may be via phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)\u03b4-induced hyperphosphorylation of HDAC2 particularly since PI3K\u03b4 is upregulated in peripheral lung tissue of patients with COPD. Use of inhaled PI3K\u03b4-selective inhibitors may even prove more efficacious in improving patient responses to ICS [63]. The results of an ongoing phase IIa large controlled study [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03345407] on the efficacy of a highly selective inhaled PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor (GSK2269557) in patients with stable COPD are awaited with interest.",

There is some evidence that this may be linked to changes in HDAC and HAT activities. p38 MAPK may also modulate GR responses by changing GR phosphorylation status. Phosphorylation of GR on Ser134 is p38 MAPK-dependent and significantly downregulates dexamethasone-dependent genome-wide transcriptional responses and cell functions.

Neutrophilic asthma is associated with GC refractoriness and increased IL-17 expression and Th17 cells. An animal model of asthma demonstrated that Th17 cell transfer causes a dexamethasone-insensitive neutrophilic inflammatory response and bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine. More importantly, IL-17 inhibits budesonide sensitivity in primary human bronchial epithelial cells through modulating PI3K and HDAC2 expression [9, 15, 64, 65].",

In human experimental models of virally induced asthmatic exacerbations, neither ICS nor oral prednisolone prevents the worsening of airway inflammation or improves clinical symptoms. IFN\u03b3 may be one of the dominant mediators responsible for chronic persistent airflow obstruction in severe asthma, and primary bronchial epithelial cells stimulated with IFN\u03b3 do not respond to GC. These inflammatory responses are, however, completely ablated by treatment of cells with a JAK-STAT inhibitor. Exposure of primary human airway epithelial cells to RV-16 causes a relative GC resistance by preventing GR nuclear import. This is reversed by suppression of the RV-16-induced JNK and NF-\u03baB pathways [9, 15, 66].",

This is in contrast to their biological effects which last for 18\u201336 h [10, 63, 68].The pharmacokinetic properties of topical drugs depend upon a combination of tissue deposition/targeting, receptor binding, volume of distribution, tissue retention and lipid conjugation. In addition, in order to achieve a good therapeutic index, drugs need to possess a low oral bioavailability and small particle size, rapid metabolism, high clearance, high plasma protein binding and a low systemic half-life. Furthermore, an ideal compound would be inactive at sites distal to the target organ/tissues [69, 70].",

Alternatively, for IBD the corticosteroid can be altered to reduce gastrointestinal absorption and/or enhance first-pass hepatic metabolism. Prolonged retention in the tissue can be achieved by increasing lipophilicity, as with fluticasone propionate (FP) and fluticasone furoate (FF) and mometasone furoate, or by forming soluble intracellular fatty acid esters, as with budesonide and ciclesonide [9, 15, 63, 72, 73].",

For example, fluticasone (both propionate and furoate) has high lipophilicity and binding affinity for the GR, resulting in a high volume of distribution and long plasma half-life. However, the systemic side effects of fluticasone that arise from systemic absorption are limited due to its almost complete first-pass metabolism in the liver and, in the case of gastrointestinal delivery, low absorption from the gastrointestinal tract [10, 63, 74]. In general, for topical corticosteroids, treatment efficacy and side effects are directly related to tissue dose.

In addition, ICSs have profound effects on the function, terminal differentiation and activation status of macrophages and monocytes in asthma. In particular, they reduce the expression of macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. ICS treatment reduces peripheral blood levels of monocytes and also their low affinity IgE receptor expression. ICS, by regulating DC CCR7 expression, can modulate DC migration to local lymphoid collections.

Current national and international guidelines for the management of stable COPD patients recommend the use of inhaled long-acting bronchodilators, ICS and their combination for maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe stable COPD (https://goldcopd.org) [63]. Several large controlled clinical trials of inhaled combination therapy with ICS and LABAs/ULABAs in stable COPD have shown that this combination therapy is well tolerated and produces a modest but statistically significant reduction in the number of severe exacerbations and improvement in FEV1, quality of life and respiratory symptoms in stable COPD patients (see also Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-10811-3_23). In addition, the Towards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) study showed a 17% relative reduction in mortality over 3 years for patients receiving salmeterol/fluticasone propionate, although this just failed to reach significance. Some patients with COPD do respond to ICS however. The Groningen and Leiden Universities Corticosteroids in Obstructive Lung Disease (GLUCOLD) study suggested that particular phenotypes of COPD benefit from fluticasone propionate \u00b1 salmeterol by reducing the rate of lung function decline. In ICS-responsive patients, the expression of genes associated with cell cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, epithelial cell signalling, p53 signalling and T-cell signalling was decreased. Overall, the long-term benefits of ICS on FEV1 decline in moderate-to-severe COPD were most pronounced in patients with fewer pack-years and less severe emphysema and inflammation [76].",

Autoimmune liver diseases result from an immune-mediated injury of different tissues, with autoimmune hepatitis targeting hepatocytes and primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis targeting cholangiocyte. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommends the use of combination therapy with prednisone (or prednisolone) and azathioprine as first choice treatment. Monotherapy with prednisone is preferred in cases of pregnancy, however. For combination therapy, the induction dose of prednisone is 30 mg daily for 1 week, followed by 20 mg daily for 1 week, followed by 15 mg daily for 2 weeks. The maintenance dose is 10 mg daily until treatment is stopped. For monotherapy, a typical induction dose of prednisone is 60 mg daily for 1 week followed by 40 mg in the second week and 30 mg daily in the third and fourth week. The maintenance dose of prednisone is 20 mg daily until the endpoint or deep clinical remission. Prednisone should be tapered over time and eventually discontinued. AASLD recommends at least 3 years of treatment. Upon completion of prednisone, patients are classified as in remission, relapsed or treatment failure based on their histopathological and laboratory response to corticosteroids and the presence or absence of clinical symptoms. Mycophenolate mofetil, calcineurin inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors and biological agents are reserved for selected nonresponsive patients and administered only in experienced centres. Liver transplantation is a life-saving option for those patients who progress to end-stage liver disease [88\u201390].",

However, the highest risk factor appears to be prolonged use.

The number needed to harm to cause one additional tuberculosis event is lower for patients with COPD treated with ICSs in endemic areas than for those in nonendemic areas (909 vs. 1667, respectively) [129].

Several SEGRAMs have been reported which show dissociated properties in human cells and are now in clinical development, showing good separation between transrepression and transactivation actions in the skin. This suggests that the development of SEGRAMs with a greater margin of safety is possible and may even lead to the development of oral compounds that have reduced adverse effects. Furthermore, the newer inhaled corticosteroids used today, such as fluticasone (both propionate and furoate), mometasone and budesonide, appear to have more potent transrepressing than transactivating effects, which may account, at least in part, for their selection as potent anti-inflammatory agents [9, 15]. These new potent corticosteroids are particularly effective as topical agents, and their use has overtaken that of oral/systemic corticosteroids for many diseases. An alternative approach to obtain safer drugs is the use of soft drugs, such as ciclesonide, which are only activated at the site of inflammation. Ciclesonide is a novel inhaled corticosteroid for the treatment of asthma. Ciclesonide itself is inactive and needs to be cleaved by lung-specific esterases in order to bind to the GR. According to data from healthy volunteers and asthma patients, ciclesonide affects serum cortisol levels significantly less compared to beclomethasone dipropionate or fluticasone propionate, indicating that ciclesonide might have lesssystemic effects and hence a superior safety profile [9, 15].",

            "text": "Corticosteroids are the most effective therapy for chronic immune and inflammatory diseases in current use. Despite their success over the past 70 years, and especially since the advent of new potent halogenated compounds, worries about the detrimental side effects of systemic corticosteroids have limited their long-term use. This has resulted in the increasing use of topical corticosteroids targeted to the site of inflammation rather than systemic administration. Improvements in risk/benefit ratios are likely to occur, as greater understanding of the role of chemical substitution of the synthetic corticosteroids becomes clear and more potent tissue selective drugs are developed. Drugs that target distinct aspects of corticosteroid function, switching on or off genes, are also under development and, along with non-steroidal agents that target different aspects of the inflammatory response, are likely to lead to safer drugs with a much reduced side effect profile. However, until these become widely available, current systemic and topical corticosteroids are likely to remain the major treatment for most acute and chronic inflammatory diseases.",

In response to many external and internal stimuli (such as circadian rhythm and stress responses), neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus release the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) that travels to the anterior pituitary, where it stimulates the corticotroph cells of the anterior pituitary to release the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) that by binding to cell surface ACTH receptors, located primarily on the adrenocortical cells of the adrenal gland, stimulates the production of both glucocorticoids (cortisol) and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone), which are termed for this reason corticosteroids. Cortisol has many functions in different cells and tissues, including hepatic gluconeogenesis (for this reason the molecules mimicking its effect are also termed glucocorticoids). Cortisol also inhibits the secretion of both CRH and ACTH",

The glucocorticoid can freely migrate across the plasma membrane where it associates with the cytoplasmic GR. This results in activation of the GR and dissociation from the heat shock protein (hsp90) chaperone complex. Firstly, activated GR translocates to the nucleus where it can bind as a monomer either directly or indirectly with the transcription factors, activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), preventing their ability to switch on inflammatory gene expression \u2460. Secondly, the GR dimer can bind to a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) that overlaps the DNA binding site for a pro-inflammatory transcription factor or the start site of transcription thereby preventing inflammatory gene expression \u2461. Thirdly, the GR dimer can induce the expression of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor I\u03baB\u03b1 \u2462, and fourthly glucorticoids can increase the levels of cell ribonucleases and mRNA destabilising proteins, thereby reducing the levels of mRNA \u2463",
