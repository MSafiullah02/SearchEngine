All these factors, may lead to unusual stress, moral injury or mental health problems even in the setting of trained caregivers accustomed to high workload [2].

Also, a pilot-test of the survey instrument among HCW was recommended to assess its validity. However, owing to time constraints, this was not done. Further assessments of this questionnaire in other populations could improve its reliability. The survey duration was voluntarily reduced knowing the current workload of physicians. Our study was timed after the announcement of an extension of the duration of the ongoing semester of this academic year, which could be a confusion bias of stress. Indeed, in France, residency is divided into semesters within different departments (in May and November).
