Those with direct contact had worse quality of life scores after their shifts, although this improved following self-quarantine and off duty shifts.At baseline, both those with direct and indirect contact had equally high perceived stress levels. At follow up 1 year later, stress levels were greater in those who had direct contact with SARS patients during the outbreak.Depression was greater in participants with direct contact with SARS patients (38.5% vs. 3.1%) but there was no significant difference in post-traumatic stress symptoms (33% vs. 18.7%).Major depression and new onset of any psychiatric disorder were more common among health care workers with a history of psychiatric illness, with new episodes of psychiatric disorders occurring in 5% of participants 1-2 years after the outbreak. 4% participants had mental health symptoms, which was lower than in the general population. However, the level of somatic symptoms was higher, especially in medical staff.",
