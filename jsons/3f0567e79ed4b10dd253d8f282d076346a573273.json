            "text": "Background: Cryptosporidium is among the most common causes of severe diarrhea in African children 0-23 months old. It is associated with excess mortality, stunting and malnutrition. The most common manifestation of cryptosporidium is intestinal diarrheal disease. However, respiratory cryptosporidiosis has been documented in up to a third of children presenting with diarrhea. It is unclear whether respiratory involvement is a transient phenomenon or a reservoir for gastrointestinal (GI) disease. This study aims to evaluate the role of respiratory cryptosporidiosis in pediatric diarrheal disease. Methods: This is a prospective, observational study conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) in Blantyre, Malawi. Young children aged 2-24 months hospitalized with diarrhea will be enrolled. Enrolled children will have induced sputum, nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and stool samples collected. All participants positive for cryptosporidium on sputum/NP/stool PCR testing will be followed up fortnightly after discharge from the hospital up to 8 weeks post-discharge. Sputum/NP/stool sample collection will be done at each visit. The primary outcomes will be presence of Cryptosporidium spp. in sputum/NP/stool. The secondary outcome will be presence of respiratory and GI symptoms, mortality and stunting. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Malawi College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (COMREC) and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) research ethics committee. Discussion: The study began recruitment activities at QECH in February 2019. The protocol allows for expansion of recruitment to secondary sites within Blantyre and Chikwawa districts in the event that targets are not met at QECH. Study recruitment is expected to continue until early 2020.",

The Global Enteric Study (GEMS) identified Cryptosporidium as the second most common cause of diarrhea among infants (0-11 months) in all four African countries studied (The Gambia, Mali, Mozambique and Kenya) regardless of HIV prevalence, and among the top five causes for older children (12-23 months) [2] . The Etiology, Risk Factors and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development Program (MAL-ED) noted that cryptosporidiosis is the fifth highest attributable pathogen in all pediatric diarrhea in the community setting, and has increased frequency among those with prolonged and severe diarrhea [1] . Cryptosporidiosis is associated with excess mortality in children who had the infection in infancy, and this excess mortality persists into the second year of life. Respiratory cryptosporidiosis has been documented in up to a third of children presenting with diarrhea [5] ; furthermore, respiratory detection without intestinal involvement has been reported, raising the possibility of primary respiratory infection with Cryptosporidium spp., either by inhalation or by contact with fomites [6] .",

Studies have evaluated sputum induction among pediatric patients who have severe or very severe pneumonia. In > 1000 procedures performed in children with severe pneumonia admitted to Kilifi District Hospital in Kenya, only 1 serious adverse event occurred (a child with a known seizure disorder had a brief convulsion during the administration of hypertonic saline; the procedure was stopped and the child recovered without sequelae [9] . Of 108 children enrolled into the pilot study in New Caledonia, none had an adverse event sufficiently severe to require increased oxygen therapy or nebulization or that led to termination of the procedure [9] . The Pneumonia Etiology Research in Child Health (PERCH) conducted induced sputum on all enrolled children between 1 and 59 months of age at 5 African sites. Induced sputum was successfully obtained on the vast majority of children at all study sites and with the correct training and resources was regarded as relatively straightforward and safe [10] .",
