Records of birth, death, reportable communicable and selected noncommunicable conditions (such as cancers, birth defects, neurological conditions), and hospitalization data\u2014e.g. admissions by cause, length of stay\u2014are essential data bases providing basic tools of epidemiology and health management. The use of detailed individual data, such as in mandatory reporting of infectious diseases and birth defects, e.g., is needed for case-finding and follow-up activities which is vital for population health monitoring and good epidemiologic management of disease outbreaks and routine monitoring functions of public health. However, caution is needed in data use to avoid individual identification to prejudice privacy, or that could be used punitively, such as in denial of access to health insurance or employment for smokers, alcoholics, or AIDS patients on the grounds that these are known causes of health damage that may be attributed to self-inflicted risk factors or preexisting conditions. This may become even more important if preexisting conditions or genetic susceptibility come to be used as determining factors to access health insurance or employment. Reporting is mandatory for physical for sexual abuse and criminally linked injuries as a measure essential for protection of vulnerable groups such as children, women, elderly, ethnic minority groups, or the general public from serious harm from bullying, abuse, violence or incitement to genocide.",

This book provides a full narrative of the development and implementation of this policy of genocide, while also setting it in the broader context of Nazi racial policies toward the Slavs, and toward Gypsies, homosexuals, petty criminals and \u2018asocials\u2019.\u201d (preface xiv).Evans continues: \u201cFor many years, and not merely since 1933, the medical profession, particularly in the field of psychiatry, had been convinced that it was legitimate to identify a minority of handicapped as \u2018a life unworthy of life\u2019, and that it was necessary to remove them from the chain of heredity if all the many measures to improve the health of the German race under the Third Reich were not to be frustrated. Virtually the entire medical profession has been actively involved in the sterilization programme, and from here it was but a short step in the minds of many to involuntary euthanasia\u201d (page 82). \u201cBy the time the main killing programme had ended, in August 1941, a large part of the medical and caring professions had been brought in to operate the machinery of murder.\u2026 the circle of those involved had grown inexorably wider, until general practitioners, psychiatrists, social workers, asylum staff, orderlies, nurses and managers, drivers and many others had become involved, through a mixture of bureaucratic routine, peer pressure, propaganda and inducements and rewards.\u2026 Having proved itself in this context, it was ready to be applied in others, on a far larger scale.\u201d (p. 101).The T4 euthanasia program was administered directly from Hitler\u2019s main office \u201cThe euthenasia program was preceded by mass sterilization of nearly 400,000 \u2018unfit\u2019 Germans before the war broke out\u201d (p. 105).(Evans RJ.

The eugenic theory assumption was that a healthy population must be \u201cfree\u201d of \u201cracially contaminated\u201d individuals and inferior groups which led to a public policy to eliminate racially \u201cunclean\u201d members through forced sterilization and murder opening the door to a euthanasia program of mass execution of mentally and physically handicapped Germans and others in psychiatric facilities, which provided a working model for the industrialized murder of the Holocaust. This was in direct conflict to a 200-year tradition of Germany\u2019s socially-oriented public health grounded in the political philosophy of human rights and social justice, many of whose advocates were mostly exiled or murdered.

An outline of genocides of the past 100 years is seen in Box 13.2\n. The Turkish genocide of Armenians in 1917 was followed by horrific genocides carried out under the flag of communism in Soviet USSR in the 1920s, in the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China under Chairman Mao in the 1950s and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia in the 1980s, nationalism in the former Yugoslav republics in the 1990s and ethnic hatred in Darfur in the early years of the 21st century, and in civil war in Syria in the second decade of the 21st century. Totalitarian dictatorships, past war and defeat, ideologies of exclusiveness, ethnic purity and religious fundamentalism increase risks for genocide. Perpetrators use dehumanizing, demonizing and delegitimizing hate speech to desensitize or intimidate bystanders and to incite, mobilize, order and instruct followers to carry out mass murder.Box 13.2Eugenics and Genocide: \u201cthe Slippery Slope\u201dEugenics was a movement within the \u201cSocial Hygiene\u201d concept of the early part of the 20th century. It was widely promoted to improve the population by reducing births among mentally ill and handicapped people. Legislation in some states in the US was upheld in decisions of the Supreme Court.In 1942, the American Journal of Psychiatry published three articles, one arguing that \u201cfeebleminded\u201d people should be killed (i.e., euthanasia). A rebuttal argued against euthanasia. An unsigned editorial position was that \u201ceuthanasia\u201d would be appropriate in some cases, and that parents\u2019 opposition to this procedure should be the subject of psychiatric concern. The arguments referred to the context of eugenics and the murder of mental patients in Germany. The editorial pointed out that those genetic theories in psychiatry could be a precursor for future similar proposals. Forced sterilization was also practiced in Canada and Sweden.This idea was promoted by Hitler in Mein Kampf and adopted by the Nazi party, which was legally elected to office in 1933. Organized massacres of mentally-ill and handicapped children and adults led to practices of various modes of killing, including starvation and gas chambers. These methods were then applied in concentration camps and the Holocaust murder of six million Jews and millions of others.Genocide represents the most extreme assault on the respect for life. During the 20th century, an estimated 200 million have died during genocide. Totalitarian dictatorships, past wars and defeat, ideologies of exclusiveness, ethnic purity, and religious fundamentalism increase risks for genocide.

It was meant to follow the natural course of syphilis in 399 infected African-American men in Alabama and 201 uninfected men. The men were not told that they were being used as research subjects. The experiment had been intended to show the need for additional services for those infected with syphilis. However, when penicillin became available in 1942, the researchers did not inform or offer the men treatment, even those who were eligible when drafted into the army in 1942. The experiment was stopped in 1972 as \u201cethically unjustified\u201d when the media exposed it to public scrutiny.The case is considered unethical research practice because, in the time it was conducted, it did not provide the patients with information on the research nor on the availability of curative care when it became available. The patients\u2019 well-being was put aside in the interest of a descriptive study.A similar experiment was conducted by the US Public Health Service in full cooperation with the Guatemala Ministry of Health during 1946\u20131948 in which soldiers, prisoners, and others were deliberately exposed to prostitutes known to be infected with syphilis. This experiment was terminated when it was revealed in the US media by a historian.In 1997, President Bill Clinton apologized to the survivors and families of the men involved in the experiment on behalf of the US government. The Tuskegee experiment is the source of widespread lingering suspicion of public health in the African-American community to the present time.Source: Adapted from Tulchinsky TH, Varavikova EA.

This surveillance is mostly anonymous, but relies on individually identifiable data needed for reportable and infectious disease control as well as for causes of death, birth defects, mass screening programs, and other special disease registries. It may also be necessary to monitor the effects of chronic disease, for example, to ascertain repeat hospitalizations of patients with congestive heart failure to assess the long-term effects of treatment, and the effects strengthening ambulatory and outreach services to sustain chronic patients at a safe and functional level in their own homes.",

Clinical research uses experimental methods to establish the efficacy and safety of new or unproven interventions; many drugs and procedures in common use have never been subjected to randomized controlled trials. In practice, many methods are devised that are held to be effective and safe by expert opinion and documented as such. Researchers comparing HIV or hepatitis B transmission rates among intravenous drug users not using needle exchange programs would be doing unethical research, according to accepted current standards, by giving safe needles to the experimental group and withholding them from the control group. The scientific justification of an experiment must be made explicit but would not likely be approved by an Ethical Review Board (Helsinki Committee).

The importance of responsible medical journalism to keep a watchful eye on the possibilities of misleading scientific publications is of great importance for the ethical and legal aspects of public health.Box 13.4The Wakefield EffectIn 1998, one of the top medical journals in the world, Lancet, published an article by a number of well-known researchers headed by Dr. Andrew Wakefield. The article reported on 12 cases of autistic children and allegedly showed a connection to immunization with MMR vaccine (measles-mumps-rubella).The immediate effect of this \u201crevelation\u201d was widespread alarm in the United Kingdom and abroad concerning MMR vaccine and a drop in immunization coverage with measles-containing vaccines in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. This was mainly triggered by mothers refusing to have their child vaccinated with the \u201crisk of autism\u201d. As a result, measles epidemics occurred in the United Kingdom and in many other countries with the disease again becoming endemic in many parts of Europe and spreading to North and South America by travelers and tourists.After a long series of investigative journalism in the British press, the article came under scientific scrutiny and the withdrawal of many of the coauthors, but consistent insistence by the lead author of its authenticity. Coauthors admitted to having been credulous and insufficiently vigilant in agreeing to be associated with the paper. British medical authorities later found Dr. Wakefield guilty of medical fraud and the UK General Medical Council withdrew his license to practice medicine. In 2000, 12 years after the original publication, Lancet formally withdrew the article. This fraudulent scientific publication caused a serious loss of the credibility of immunization in general, and especially regarding MMR vaccine, one of the greatest life savers of public health.The return of measles in Europe to endemicity with frequent international transmission, fostered loss of confidence by mothers in immunization. Measles-containing vaccines were particularly affected due to the publicity given to the Wakefield case and issues of scientific integrity. Fraud and conflict of interests were proven in this case. The journal editors failed to ensure the scientific integrity of the lead author and coauthors, and were negligent in failure of the journal to retract fraudulent and disproven publications in real time, instead of waiting 12 years after publication.In other public health issues, single publications of findings of small sample and poorly assessed studies published in haste without adequate critical review occur frequently. In electronic media, the problem of disinformation provokes great anxiety and rejection of well-established successful public health interventions such as fluoridation, and folic acid fortification of flour, with unsubstantiated and disproven claims that they may cause cancer, asthma, and other ill effects.The interface between ethics, law, and science in public health requires continuous sensitivity to the downstream effects of reducing public trust and reduced parental compliance with immunization of their children and putting other children at risk.Source: Adapted from Tulchinsky TH, Varavikova EA.

A study comparing myocardial infarctions in New York counties that banned trans fat usage to counties that did not showed a greater reduction in acute myocardial infarctions in the counties that had banned trans fats. The ethical issue will be to see the rate of acceptance of this finding in other jurisdictions versus traditional opposition to too much interference by the state. The same issue regarding folic acid fortification of flour to reduce birth defects is similarly both a professional and ethical question. Virtually all European countries have ignored the evidence and fail to adopt mandatory fortification thus harming poorer population groups with less money to buy healthier foods. The delay in implementation of proven safe and effective public health measures is one of the key ethical issues in public health practice.",

Ethics in health also requires commitment to advancement of health care and use of best practices of international standards to the maximum extent possible under the local conditions in which the professional is working. This is not an easy commitment as there is often dispute and outright hostility to public health activities in part because of past ethical distortions of great magnitude. But this is an optimistic field of activity by virtue of the great achievements it has brought to humankind. Preparation for disasters and unanticipated health emergencies can raise issues of security, quarantine, isolation, rationing of vaccines due to insufficient supplies\u2014e.g., in influenza epidemics\u2014or restrictions on community events or family burials as in the case of Ebola in West Africa in 2014\u201316.",

While resource allocation is a political decision, failure to act can be as injurious and unethical as being directly responsible for harmful acts. Public health as a profession and a movement or ideology must be willing to point out the effects of nonaction as well as of ethical or nonethical acts.
