Among different polymorphisms, it has been speculated that ACE2 rs2106809 might exhibit primary effects on the ACE2 levels. The circulating ACE2 levels tend to be greater in CC or CT genotype compared with that in the TT genotype. One possible mechanism can be mediated by microRNA, which could modulate endothelial function via translational repression and/or posttranscriptional degradation.",

A recent single-cell RNAsequencing (RNA-seq) analysis indicated that Asian males may have a higher expression of tissue ACE2 (13) . In another case control study conducted in the north eastern Chinese Han population, the serum ACE2 activity negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI), pulse pressure, and estrogen levels in female EH (essential hypertension) patients (14) . These observations point both to a cardiovascular protective effect of circulating levels of ACE2 and simultaneously prove that estrogens participate in the upregulation of ACE2 expression and activity levels (15) . This might explain the relative protection of female vs. male in COVID-19 infection. Taken together, this evidence seem to indicate that the putative sex predisposition to COVID-19, with men being more susceptible, might be reflective of a peculiar ACE plasma profile.",

For example, ACE levels in children (6 months to 17 years of age) are 13-100 U/l compared with 9-67 U/l in adults when using an FAPGG-based enzymatic activity assay. Of note is the fact that children with confirmed COVID-19 have generally presented with mild symptoms. Cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among children in China have been less severe than those in adults, according to a new study. In a study of 1,099 patients in China, just 0.9 percent of the confirmed cases were under the age of nine, while only 1.2 percent were between 10 and 19 years old (17) . A similar phenomenon in a mouse study in North Carolina was registered by Baric et al.-although SARS-CoV can replicate fairly well, younger animals are really resistant to infection in terms of the disease. When older animals were tested, the severity of SARS illnesses rose (18) .",

By a buffering effect, and much like neutralizing antibodies, soluble ACE2 may help children and asymptomatic people to better counteract virus spreading to a cell target. On one hand, this could help them to contain infection. On the other hand, this could also let these carriers be an important reservoir of circulating virus, and so this deserve much of our attention in the near future.",

Now, circulating level of ACE2 may have prognostic effect in monitoring COVID-infection, and the genetic analysis of ACE2 polymorphisms might be a key element of individualized care for its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. In this context, an ELISA-based accurate quantification of human soluble ACE2, not only in serum and EDTA plasma but also in more accessible human body fluids (e.g., saliva, urine, tears, and milk), should be proposed as a first rapid test screening. To be noted, a standardized protocol for sampling, transport, and storage before its dosage, must be rigorously followed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of inter-and intra-individual quantitation during the course of pathology. Furthermore, correct tests should be carried out in simultaneously in aged-matched healthy volunteers for comparisons. If the current hypothesis is correct, ACE2 determination, by both ELISA and more sensitive HPLC-MS methods, may represent a less extensive and time-consuming means to monitor COVID-19 infection both at pre-clinical and clinical levels.",
