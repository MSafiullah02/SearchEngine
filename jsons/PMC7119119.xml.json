            "text": "The Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Health Care Settings 2007 updates and expands the 1996 Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals. The following developments led to these revisions of the 1996 guideline:1.The transition of health care delivery from primarily acute care hospitals to other health care settings (eg, home care, ambulatory care, free-standing specialty care sites, long-term care) created a need for recommendations that can be applied in all health care settings using common principles of infection control practice, yet can be modified to reflect setting-specific needs. Accordingly, the revised guideline addresses the spectrum of health care delivery settings. Furthermore, the term \u201cnosocomial infections\u201c is replaced by \u201chealth care\u2013associated infections\u201d (HAIs), to reflect the changing patterns in health care delivery and difficulty in determining the geographic site of exposure to an infectious agent and/or acquisition of infection.2.The emergence of new pathogens (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] associated with SARS avian influenza in humans), renewed concern for evolving known pathogens (eg, Clostridium difficile, noroviruses, community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [CA-MRSA]), development of new therapies (eg, gene therapy), and increasing concern for the threat of bioweapons attacks, necessitates addressing a broader scope of issues than in previous isolation guidelines.3.The successful experience with Standard Precautions, first recommended in the 1996 guideline, has led to a reaffirmation of this approach as the foundation for preventing transmission of infectious agents in all health care settings. New additions to the recommendations for Standard Precautions are respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette and safe injection practices, including the use of a mask when performing certain high-risk, prolonged procedures involving spinal canal punctures (eg, myelography, epidural anesthesia). The need for a recommendation for respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette grew out of observations during the SARS outbreaks, when failure to implement simple source control measures with patients, visitors, and health care workers (HCWs) with respiratory symptoms may have contributed to SARS-CoV transmission. The recommended practices have a strong evidence base. The continued occurrence of outbreaks of hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses in ambulatory settings indicated a need to reiterate safe injection practice recommendations as part of Standard Precautions. The addition of a mask for certain spinal injections grew from recent evidence of an associated risk for developing meningitis caused by respiratory flora.4.The accumulated evidence that environmental controls decrease the risk of life-threatening fungal infections in the most severely immunocompromised patients (ie, those undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT]) led to the update on the components of the protective environment (PE).5.Evidence that organizational characteristics (eg, nurse staffing levels and composition, establishment of a safety culture) influence HCWs' adherence to recommended infection control practices, and thus are important factors in preventing transmission of infectious agents, led to a new emphasis and recommendations for administrative involvement in the development and support of infection control programs.6.Continued increase in the incidence of HAIs caused by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in all health care settings and the expanded body of knowledge concerning prevention of transmission of MDROs created a need for more specific recommendations for surveillance and control of these pathogens that would be practical and effective in various types of health care settings.\n",

This became a concern during the SARS outbreaks of 2003, when transmission associated with aerosol-generating procedures was observed. Also new is a definition of \u201cepidemiologically important organisms\u201d that was developed to assist in the identification of clusters of infections that require investigation (ie multidrug-resistant organisms, C difficile). Several other pathogens of special infection control interest (ie, norovirus, SARS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] category A bioterrorist agents, prions, monkeypox, and the hemorrhagic fever viruses) also are discussed, to present new information and infection control lessons learned from experience with these agents.

An important administrative priority that is described is the need for appropriate infection control staffing to meet the ever-expanding role of infection control professionals in the complex modern health care system. Evidence presented also demonstrates another administrative concern: the importance of nurse staffing levels, including ensuring numbers of appropriately trained nurses in intensive care units (ICUs) for preventing HAIs. The role of the clinical microbiology laboratory in supporting infection control is described, to emphasize the need for this service in health care facilities.

One important change is the recommendation to don the indicated personal protective equipment (PPE\u2014gowns, gloves, mask) on entry into the patient's room for patients who are on Contact and/or Droplet Precautions, because the nature of the interaction with the patient cannot be predicted with certainty, and contaminated environmental surfaces are important sources for transmission of pathogens.

Much of the evidence cited for preventing transmission of infectious agents in health care settings is derived from studies that used \u201cquasi-experimental designs,\u201d also referred to as nonrandomized preintervention and postintervention study designs.2 Although these types of studies can provide valuable information regarding the effectiveness of various interventions, several factors decrease the certainty of attributing improved outcome to a specific intervention. These include: difficulties in controlling for important confounding variables, the use of multiple interventions during an outbreak, and results that are explained by the statistical principle of regression to the mean (eg, improvement over time without any intervention).3 Observational studies remain relevant and have been used to evaluate infection control interventions.4, 5 The quality of studies, consistency of results, and correlation with results from randomized controlled trials, when available, were considered during the literature review and assignment of evidence-based categories (see Part IV: Recommendations) to the recommendations in this guideline. Several authors have summarized properties to consider when evaluating studies for the purpose of determining whether the results should change practice or in designing new studies.2, 6, 7\n",

            "text": "This guideline contains 4 changes in terminology from the 1996 guideline:1.The term \u201cnosocomial infection\u201d is retained to refer only to infections acquired in hospitals. The term \u201chealth care\u2013associated infection\u201d (HAI) is used to refer to infections associated with health care delivery in any setting (eg, hospitals, long-term care facilities, ambulatory settings, home care). This term reflects the inability to determine with certainty where the pathogen was acquired, because patients may be colonized with or exposed to potential pathogens outside of the health care setting before receiving health care, or may develop infections caused by those pathogens when exposed to the conditions associated with delivery of health care. In addition, patients frequently move among the various settings within the health care system.8\n2.A new addition to the practice recommendations for Standard Precautions is respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette. Whereas Standard Precautions generally apply to the recommended practices of HCWs during patient care, respiratory hygiene/cough etiquette applies broadly to all persons who enter a health care setting, including HCWs, patients, and visitors. These recommendations evolved from observations during the SARS epidemic that failure to implement basic source control measures with patients, visitors, and HCWs with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection may have contributed to SARS-CoV transmission. This concept has been incorporated into CDC planning documents for SARS and pandemic influenza.9, 10\n3.The term \u201cAirborne Precautions\u201d has been supplemented by the term \u201cAirborne Infection Isolation Room\u201d (AIIR), to achieve consistency with the Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health Care Facilities,11 the Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health Care Settings 2005,12 and the American Institute of Architects (AIA) 2006 guidelines for design and construction of hospitals.13\n4.A set of prevention measures known as the protective environment (PE) has been added to the precautions for preventing HAIs. These measures, which have been defined in previous guidelines, consist of engineering and design interventions aimed at decreasing the risk of exposure to environmental fungi for severely immunocompromised patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT during the times of highest risk, usually the first 100 days posttransplantation or longer in the presence of graft-versus-host disease.11, 13, 14, 15 Recommendations for a PE apply only to acute care hospitals that provide care to patients undergoing HSCT.\n",

            "text": "Infection is the result of a complex interrelationship between a potential host and an infectious agent. Most of the factors that influence infection and the occurrence and severity of disease are related to the host. However, characteristics of the host\u2013agent interaction as it relates to pathogenicity, virulence, and antigenicity also are important, as are the infectious dose, mechanisms of disease production, and route of exposure.55 There is a spectrum of possible outcomes after exposure to an infectious agent. Some persons exposed to pathogenic microorganisms never develop symptomatic disease, whereas others become severely ill and even die. Some individuals are prone to becoming transiently or permanently colonized but remain asymptomatic. Still others progress from colonization to symptomatic disease either immediately after exposure or after a period of asymptomatic colonization. The immune state at the time of exposure to an infectious agent, interaction between pathogens, and virulence factors intrinsic to the agent are important predictors of an individual's outcome. Host factors such as extremes of age and underlying disease (eg, diabetes56, 57, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome [HIV/AIDS],58, 59 malignancy, and transplantation18, 60, 61) can increase susceptibility to infection, as can various medications that alter the normal flora (eg, antimicrobial agents, gastric acid suppressors, corticosteroids, antirejection drugs, antineoplastic agents, immunosuppressive drugs). Surgical procedures and radiation therapy impair defenses of the skin and other involved organ systems. Indwelling devices, such as urinary catheters, endotracheal tubes, central venous and arterial catheters,62, 63, 64 and synthetic implants, facilitate development of HAIs by allowing potential pathogens to bypass local defenses that ordinarily would impede their invasion and by providing surfaces for development of biofilms that may facilitate adherence of microorganisms and protect from antimicrobial activity.65 Some infections associated with invasive procedures result from transmission within the health care facility; others arise from the patient's endogenous flora.46, 47, 48, 49, 50 High-risk patient populations with noteworthy risk factors for infection are discussed further in Sections I.D, I.E, and I.F.",

            "text": "Droplet transmission is technically a form of contact transmission; some infectious agents transmitted by the droplet route also may be transmitted by direct and indirect contact routes. However, in contrast to contact transmission, respiratory droplets carrying infectious pathogens transmit infection when they travel directly from the respiratory tract of the infectious individual to susceptible mucosal surfaces of the recipient, generally over short distances, necessitating facial protection. Respiratory droplets are generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks91, 92 or during such procedures as suctioning, endotracheal intubation,93, 94, 95, 96 cough induction by chest physiotherapy,97 and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.98, 99 Evidence for droplet transmission comes from epidemiologic studies of disease outbreaks,100, 101, 102, 103 from experimental studies,104 and from information on aerosol dynamics.91, 105 Studies have shown that the nasal mucosa, conjunctivae, and, less frequently, the mouth are susceptible portals of entry for respiratory viruses.106 The maximum distance for droplet transmission is currently unresolved; pathogens transmitted by the droplet route have not been transmitted through the air over long distances, in contrast to the airborne pathogens discussed below. Historically, the area of defined risk has been a distance of < 3 feet around the patient, based on epidemiologic and simulated studies of selected infections.103, 104 Using this distance for donning masks has been effective in preventing transmission of infectious agents through the droplet route. However, experimental studies with smallpox107, 108 and investigations during the global SARS outbreaks of 2003101 suggest that droplets from patients with these 2 infections could reach persons located 6 feet or more from their source. It is likely that the distance that droplets travel depends on the velocity and mechanism by which respiratory droplets are propelled from the source, the density of respiratory secretions, environmental factors (eg, temperature, humidity), and the pathogen's ability to maintain infectivity over that distance.105 Thus, a distance of < 3 feet around the patient is best considered an example of what is meant by \u201ca short distance from a patient\u201d and should not be used as the sole criterion for determining when a mask should be donned to protect from droplet exposure. Based on these considerations, it may be prudent to don a mask when within 6 to 10 feet of the patient or on entry into the patient's room, especially when exposure to emerging or highly virulent pathogens is likely. More studies are needed to gain more insight into droplet transmission under various circumstances.",

Droplet nuclei (ie, particles arising from desiccation of suspended droplets) have been associated with airborne transmission and defined as < 5 \u03bcm in size,105 a reflection of the pathogenesis of pulmonary tuberculosis that is not generalizeable to other organisms. Observations of particle dynamics have demonstrated that a range of droplet sizes, including those of diameter \u2265 30 \u03bcm, can remain suspended in the air.109 The behavior of droplets and droplet nuclei affect recommendations for preventing transmission. Whereas fine airborne particles containing pathogens that are able to remain infective may transmit infections over long distances, requiring AIIR to prevent its dissemination within a facility; organisms transmitted by the droplet route do not remain infective over long distances and thus do not require special air handling and ventilation. Examples of infectious agents transmitted through the droplet route include B pertussis,110 influenza virus,23 adenovirus,111 rhinovirus,104\nMycoplasma pneumoniae,112 SARS-CoV,21, 96, 113 group A streptococcus,114 and Neisseria meningitides.95, 103, 115 Although RSV may be transmitted by the droplet route, direct contact with infected respiratory secretions is the most important determinant of transmission and consistent adherence to Standard Precautions plus Contact Precautions prevents transmission in health care settings.24, 116, 117\n",

Such transmission has occurred over distances > 3 feet but within a defined air space (eg, patient room), suggesting that it is unlikely that these agents remain viable on air currents that travel long distances.

Important factors contributing to health care\u2013associated outbreaks include environmental contamination, persistence of spores for prolonged periods, resistance of spores to routinely used disinfectants and antiseptics, hand carriage by HCWs to other patients, and exposure of patients to frequent courses of antimicrobial agents.167 Antimicrobials most frequently associated with increased risk of C difficile include third-generation cephalosporins, clindamycin, vancomycin, and fluoroquinolones.",

A recent survey of US infectious disease physicians found that 40% of the respondents perceived recent increases in the incidence and severity of C difficile disease.174 Standardization of testing methodology and surveillance definitions is needed for accurate comparisons of trends in rates among hospitals.175 It is hypothesized that the incidence of disease and apparent heightened transmissibility of this new strain may be due, at least in part, to the greater production of toxins A and B, increasing the severity of diarrhea and producing more environmental contamination. Considering the greater morbidity, mortality, length of stay, and costs associated with C difficile disease in both acute care and long-term care facilities, control of this pathogen is becoming increasingly important.",

Between December 2002 and February 2005, approximately 760,000 individuals were vaccinated in the Department of Defense and 40,000 in the civilian or public health populations, including approximately 70,000 who worked in health care settings. No cases of eczema vaccinatum, progressive vaccinia, fetal vaccinia, or contact transfer of vaccinia were reported in health care settings or in military workplaces.218, 219 Outside the health care setting, there were 53 cases of contact transfer from military vaccinees to close personal contacts (eg, bed partners or contacts during participation in sports such as wrestling220). All contact transfers were from individuals who were not following recommendations to cover their vaccination sites. Vaccinia virus was confirmed by culture or PCR in 30 cases, 2 of which resulted from tertiary transfer. All recipients, including 1 breast-fed infant, recovered without complications. Subsequent studies using viral culture and PCR techniques have confirmed the effectiveness of semipermeable dressings to contain vaccinia.221, 222, 223, 224 This experience emphasizes the importance of ensuring that newly vaccinated HCWs adhere to recommended vaccination site care, especially those caring for high-risk patients. Recommendations for pre-event smallpox vaccination of HCWs and vaccinia-related infection control recommendations are published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report,216, 225 with updates posted on the CDC's bioterrorism website.205\n",

Infectious prions are isoforms of a host-encoded glycoprotein known as the prion protein. The incubation period (ie, time between exposure and and onset of symptoms) varies from 2 years to many decades. However, death typically occurs within 1 year of the onset of symptoms. Approximately 85% of CJD cases occur sporadically with no known environmental source of infection, and 10% of cases are familial. Iatrogenic transmission has occurred, with most cases resulting from treatment with human cadaver pituitary-derived growth hormone or gonadotropin,228, 229 from implantation of contaminated human dura mater grafts,230 or from corneal transplants.231 Transmission has been linked to the use of contaminated neurosurgical instruments or stereotactic electroencephalogram electrodes.232, 233, 234, 235\n",

The possible transmission of BSE to humans causing variant CJD (vCJD) was first described in 1996 and was subsequently found to be associated with consumption of BSE-contaminated cattle products primarily in the United Kingdom. There is strong epidemiologic and laboratory evidence for a causal association between the causative agent of BSE and vCJD.237 Although most cases of vCJD have been reported from the United Kingdom, a few cases also have been reported from Europe, Japan, Canada, and the United States. Most persons affected with vCJD worldwide lived in or visited the United Kingdom during the years of a large outbreak of BSE (1980\u20131996) and may have consumed contaminated cattle products during that time (see http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/cjd/cjd.htm). Although there has been no indigenously acquired vCJD in the United States, the sporadic occurrence of BSE in cattle in North America has heightened awareness of the possibility that such infections could occur and have led to increased surveillance activities. Updated information may be found at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/cjd/cjd.htm. The public health impact of prion diseases has been reviewed previously.238\n",

SARS is caused by SARS-CoV, a previously unrecognized member of the coronavirus family.247, 248 The incubation period from exposure to the onset of symptoms is typically 2 to 7 days, but can be as long as 10 days and in rare cases even longer.249 The illness is initially difficult to distinguish from other common respiratory infections. Signs and symptoms usually include fever above 38.0\u00b0C and chills and rigors, sometimes accompanied by headache, myalgia, and mild to severe respiratory symptoms. A radiographic profile of atypical pneumonia is an important clinical indicator of possible SARS. Compared with adults, children are affected less frequently, have milder disease, and are less likely to transmit SARS-CoV.135, 249, 250, 251 The overall case fatality rate is approximately 6%; underlying disease and advanced age increase the risk of mortality (see http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_05_07a/en/).",

There is ample evidence for droplet and contact transmission;96, 101, 113 however, opportunistic airborne transmission cannot be excluded.101, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 149, 254 For example, exposure to aerosol-generating procedures (eg, endotracheal intubation, suctioning) has been associated with transmission of infection to large numbers of HCWs outside of the United States.93, 94, 96, 98, 253 Therefore, aerosolization of small infectious particles generated during these and other similar procedures could be a risk factor for transmission to others within a multibed room or shared airspace. A review of the infection control literature generated from the SARS outbreaks of 2003 concluded that the greatest risk of transmission is to those who have close contact, are not properly trained in use of protective infection control procedures, and do not consistently use PPE, and that N95 or higher-level respirators may offer additional protection to those exposed to aerosol-generating procedures and high-risk activities.255, 256 Organizational and individual factors that affect adherence to infection control practices for SARS also were identified.256\n",

The precise combination of precautions to protect HCWs has not yet been determined. At the time of this publication, the CDC recommends Standard Precautions, with emphasis on the use of hand hygiene; Contact Precautions, with emphasis on environmental cleaning due to the detection of SARS-CoV RNA by PCR on surfaces in rooms occupied by SARS patients;138, 254, 257 and Airborne Precautions, including use of fit-tested NIOSH-approved N95 or higher-level respirators and eye protection.258 In Hong Kong, the use of Droplet and Contact Precautions, including the use of a mask but not a respirator, was effective in protecting HCWs.113 However, in Toronto, consistent use of an N95 respirator was found to be slightly more protective than a mask.93 It is noteworthy that no transmission of SARS-CoV to public hospital workers occurred in Vietnam despite inconsistent use of infection control measures, including use of PPE, which suggests other factors (eg, severity of disease, frequency of high-risk procedures or events, environmental features) may influence opportunities for transmission.259\n",

In addition, individuals who are responsible for cleaning the environment may be at increased risk of infection. Development of disease and transmission may be facilitated by the low infectious dose (ie, < 100 viral particles)288 and the resistance of these viruses to the usual cleaning and disinfection agents (ie, they may survive < 10 ppm chlorine).289, 290, 291 An alternate phenolic agent that was shown to be effective against feline calicivirus was used for environmental cleaning in one outbreak.275, 292 There are insufficient data to determine the efficacy of alcohol-based hand rubs against noroviruses when the hands are not visibly soiled.293 Absence of disease in certain individuals during an outbreak may be explained by protection from infection conferred by the B histo-blood group antigen.294 Consultation on outbreaks of gastroenteritis is available through the CDC's Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases.295\n",

Although none of these viruses is endemic in the United States, outbreaks in affected countries provide potential opportunities for importation by infected humans and animals. Furthermore, there is a concern that some of these agents could be used as bioweapons.212 Person-to-person transmission has been documented for Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, and Crimean-Congo HFVs. In resource-limited health care settings, transmission of these agents to HCWs, patients, and visitors has been described and in some outbreaks has accounted for a large proportion of cases.297, 298, 299 Transmission within households also has been documented in individuals who had direct contact with ill persons or their body fluids, but not in those who did not have such contact.300\n",

In less developed countries, outbreaks of HFVs have been controlled with basic hygiene, barrier precautions, safe injection practices, and safe burial practices.298, 305 The preponderance of evidence on HFV transmission indicates that Standard, Contact, and Droplet Precautions with eye protection are effective in protecting HCWs and visitors coming in contact with an infected patient. Single gloves are adequate for routine patient care; double-gloving is advised during invasive procedures (eg, surgery) that pose an increased risk of blood exposure. Routine eye protection (ie goggles or face shield) is particularly important. Fluid-resistant gowns should be worn for all patient contact. Airborne Precautions are not required for routine patient care; however, use of AIIRs is prudent when procedures that could generate infectious aerosols are performed (eg, endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy, suctioning, autopsy procedures involving oscillating saws). N95 or higher-level respirators may provide added protection for individuals in a room during aerosol-generating procedures (Table 3, Appendix A). When a patient with a syndrome consistent with hemorrhagic fever also has a history of travel to an endemic area, precautions are initiated on presentation and then modified as more information is obtained (Table 2). Patients with hemorrhagic fever syndrome in the setting of a suspected bioweapons attack should be managed using Airborne Precautions, including AIIRs, because the epidemiology of a potentially weaponized hemorrhagic fever virus is unpredictable.",

One retrospective study demonstrated the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a simplified barrier isolation protocol for wound colonization, emphasizing handwashing and use of gloves, caps, masks, and impermeable plastic aprons (rather than isolation gowns) for direct patient contact.364 However, to date no studies have determined the most effective combination of infection control precautions for use in burn settings.

Pathogenic bacteria have been recovered from toys used by hospitalized patients;378 contaminated bath toys were implicated in an outbreak of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa on a pediatric oncology unit.80 In addition, several patient factors increase the likelihood that infection will result from exposure to pathogens in health care settings (eg, immaturity of the neonatal immune system, lack of previous natural infection and resulting immunity, prevalence of patients with congenital or acquired immune deficiencies, congenital anatomic anomalies, and use of life-saving invasive devices in NICUs and PICUs).63 There are theoretical concerns that infection risk will increase in association with innovative practices used in the NICU for the purpose of improving developmental outcomes, Such factors include co-bedding379 and kangaroo care,380 which may increase opportunity for skin-to-skin exposure of multiple gestation infants to each other and to their mothers, respectively; although the risk of infection actually may be reduced among infants receiving kangaroo care.381 Children who attend child care centers382, 383 and pediatric rehabilitation units384 may increase the overall burden of antimicrobial resistance by contributing to the reservoir of CA-MRSA.385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390 Patients in chronic care facilities may have increased rates of colonization with resistant garm-negative bacilli and may be sources of introduction of resistant organisms to acute care settings.50\n",

Ambulatory care is provided in hospital-based outpatient clinics, nonhospital-based clinics and physicians' offices, public health clinics, free-standing dialysis centers, ambulatory surgical centers, urgent care centers, and other setting. In 2000, there were 83 million visits to hospital outpatient clinics and more than 823 million visits to physicians' offices;441 ambulatory care now accounts for most patient encounters with the health care system.442 Adapting transmission prevention guidelines to these settings is challenging, because patients remain in common areas for prolonged periods waiting to be seen by a health care provider or awaiting admission to the hospital, examination or treatment rooms are turned around quickly with limited cleaning, and infectious patients may not be recognized immediately. Furthermore, immunocompromised patients often receive chemotherapy in infusion rooms, where they stay for extended periods along with other types of patients.",

Overall, 29 clusters were associated with common source transmission from contaminated solutions or equipment, 14 were associated with person-to-person transmission from or involving HCWs, and 10 were associated with airborne or droplet transmission among patients and health care workers. Transmission of bloodborne pathogens (ie, HBV, HCV, and, rarely, HIV) in outbreaks, sometimes involving hundreds of patients, continues to occur in ambulatory settings. These outbreaks often are related to common source exposures, usually a contaminated medical device, multidose vial, or intravenous solution.82, 448, 449, 450, 451, 452 In all cases, transmission has been attributed to failure to adhere to fundamental infection control principles, including safe injection practices and aseptic technique.

The main transmission risks to home care patients are from an infectious home care provider or contaminated equipment; a provider also can be exposed to an infectious patient during home visits. Because home care involves patient care by a limited number of personnel in settings without multiple patients or shared equipment, the potential reservoir of pathogens is reduced. Infections of home care providers that could pose a risk to home care patients include infections transmitted by the airborne or droplet routes (eg, chickenpox, tuberculosis, influenza), skin infestations (eg, scabies69 and lice), and infections transmitted by direct or indirect contact (eg, impetigo). There are no published data on indirect transmission of MDROs from one home care patient to another, although this is theoretically possible if contaminated equipment is transported from an infected or colonized patient and used on another patient. Of note, investigations of the first case of VISA in home care186 and the first 2 reported cases of VRSA178, 180, 181, 183 found no evidence of transmission of VISA or VRSA to other home care recipients. Home health care also may contribute to antimicrobial resistance; a review of outpatient vancomycin use found that 39% of recipients did not receive prescribed antibiotics according to recommended guidelines.476\n",

For health care organizations that outsource microbiology laboratory services (eg, ambulatory care, home care, LTCFs, smaller acute care hospitals), it is important to specify by contract the types of services (eg, periodic institution-specific aggregate susceptibility reports) required to support infection control.",

A safety culture is created through (1) the actions that management takes to improve patient and worker safety, (2) worker participation in safety planning, (3) the availability of appropriate PPE, (4) the influence of group norms regarding acceptable safety practices, and (5) the organization's socialization process for new personnel. Safety and patient outcomes can be enhanced by improving or creating organizational characteristics within patient care units, as demonstrated by studies of surgical ICUs.621, 622 Each of these factors has a direct bearing on adherence to transmission prevention recommendations.256 Measurement of an institution's culture of safety is useful in designing improvements in health care.623, 624 Several hospital-based studies have linked measures of safety culture with both employee adherence to safe practices and reduced exposures to blood and body fluids.625, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630, 631 One study of hand hygiene practices concluded that improved adherence requires integration of infection control into the organization's safety culture.560 Several hospitals that are part of the Veterans Administration health care system have taken specific steps toward improving the safety culture, including error-reporting mechanisms, root cause analyses of identified problems, safety incentives, and employee education.632, 633, 634\n",

Observed rates of appropriate glove use has ranged from a low of 15%644 to a high of 82%.649 However, 92% and 98% adherence with glove use have been reported during arterial blood gas collection and resuscitation, respectively, procedures in which considerable blood contact may occur.642, 655 Differences in observed adherence have been reported among occupational groups in the same health care facility640 and between experienced and nonexperienced professionals.644 In surveys of HCWs, self-reported adherence was generally higher than actual adherence found in observational studies. Furthermore, where an observational component was included with a self-reported survey, self-perceived adherence was often greater than observed adherence.656 Among nurses and physicians, increasing years of experience is a negative predictor of adherence.644, 650 Education to improve adherence is the primary intervention that has been studied. Whereas positive changes in knowledge and attitude have been demonstrated,639, 657 no or only limited accompanying changes in behavior often have been found.641, 643 Self-reported adherence is higher in groups that received an educational intervention.629, 658 In one study, educational interventions that incorporated videotaping and performance feedback were successful in improving adherence during the study period, but the long-term effect of such interventions is not known.653 The use of videotaping also served to identify system problems (eg, communication and access to PPE) that otherwise may not have been recognized.",

In the absence of visible soiling of hands, approved alcohol-based products for hand disinfection are preferred over antimicrobial or plain soap and water because of their superior microbiocidal activity, reduced drying of the skin, and convenience.558 Improved hand hygiene practices have been associated with a sustained decrease in the incidence of MRSA and VRE infections primarily in ICUs.560, 561, 713, 714, 715, 716 The scientific rationale, indications, methods, and products for hand hygiene have been summarized in previous publications.558, 716\n",

A facility may need to stock gloves in several sizes. Heavier, reusable utility gloves are indicated for non\u2013patient care activities, such as handling or cleaning contaminated equipment or surfaces.11, 14, 738\n",

Personal eyeglasses and contact lenses are not considered adequate eye protection (see http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/eye/eye-infectious.html). NIOSH guidelines specify that eye protection must be comfortable, allow for sufficient peripheral vision, and adjustable to ensure a secure fit. A health care facility may need to provide several different types, styles, and sizes of eye protection equipment. Indirectly vented goggles with a manufacturer's antifog coating may provide the most reliable practical eye protection from splashes, sprays, and respiratory droplets from multiple angles. Newer styles of goggles may provide better indirect airflow properties to reduce fogging, as well as better peripheral vision and more size options for fitting goggles to different workers. Many styles of goggles fit adequately over prescription glasses with minimal gaps. Although effective as eye protection, goggles do not provide splash or spray protection to other parts of the face.",

OSHA program components include medical clearance to wear a respirator; provision and use of appropriate respirators, including fit-tested NIOSH-certified N95 and higher-level particulate filtering respirators; education on respirator use, and periodic reevaluation of the respiratory protection program. When selecting particulate respirators, models with inherently good fit characteristics (ie, those expected to provide protection factors of \u2265 10% to 95% of wearers) are preferred and theoretically could preclude the need for fit testing.764, 765 Issues pertaining to respiratory protection remain the subject of ongoing debate. Information on various types of respirators is available at http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respirators/respsars.html and in several previously published studies.764, 766, 767 A user-seal check (formerly called a \u201cfit check\u201d) should be performed by the wearer of a respirator each time that the respirator is donned, to minimize air leakage around the face piece.768 The optimal frequency of fit testing has not been determined; retesting may be indicated if there is a change in wearer's facial features, onset of a medical condition that would affect respiratory function in the wearer, or a change in the model or size of the respirator that was initially assigned.12\n",

Although some studies have demonstrated effective prevention of M tuberculosis transmission in hospitals in which surgical masks instead of respirators were used in conjunction with other administrative and engineering controls.636, 769, 770 the CDC currently recommends N95 or higher-level respirators for personnel exposed to patients with suspected or confirmed tuberculosis. Currently, this recommendation also holds for other diseases that could be transmitted through the airborne route, including SARS261 and smallpox,108, 129, 771 until inhalational transmission is better defined or health care-specific PPE more suitable for preventing infection is developed. Wearing of respirators is also currently recommended during the performance of aerosol-generating procedures (eg, intubation, bronchoscopy, suctioning) in patients with SARS-CoV infection, avian influenza, and pandemic influenza (see Appendix A).",

In the absence of continued transmission, it is not necessary to provide a private bathroom for patients colonized or infected with enteric pathogens as long as personal hygiene practices and Standard Precautions (especially hand hygiene and appropriate environmental cleaning) are maintained. Assignment of a dedicated commode to a patient, and cleaning and disinfecting fixtures and equipment that may have fecal contamination (eg, bathrooms, commodes,797 scales used for weighing diapers) and the adjacent surfaces with appropriate agents may be especially important when a single-patient room cannot be assigned, because environmental contamination with intestinal tract pathogens is likely from both continent and incontinent patients.54, 798 The results of several studies that investigated the benefit of a single-patient room in preventing transmission of C difficile were inconclusive.167, 799, 800, 801 Some studies have shown that being in the same room with a colonized or infected patient is not necessarily a risk factor for transmission;790, 802, 803, 804 however, for children, the risk of health care\u2013associated diarrhea is increased with the increased number of patients per room.805 These findings demonstrate that patient factors are important determinants of infection transmission risks.

For individuals who are especially vulnerable to adverse outcomes associated with certain infections, it may be beneficial to either remove them from the home or segregate them within the home. Persons who are not part of the household may need to be prohibited from visiting during the period of infectivity. For example, in a situation where a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis is contagious and being cared for at home, very young children (age under 4 years)832 and immunocompromised persons who have not yet been infected should be removed or excluded from the household. During the SARS outbreak of 2003, segregation of infected persons during the communicable phase of the illness was found to be beneficial in preventing household transmission.249, 833\n",

The cleaning and disinfection of all patient care areas is important for frequently touched surfaces, especially those closest to the patient, which are most likely to be contaminated (eg, bedrails, bedside tables, commodes, doorknobs, sinks, surfaces and equipment in close proximity to the patient).11, 72, 73, 834 The frequency or intensity of cleaning may need to be changed, based on the patient's level of hygiene and the degree of environmental contamination and for certain infectious agents with reservoirs in the intestinal tract.54 This may be particularly important in LTCFs and pediatric facilities, where patients with stool and urine incontinence are encountered more frequently. In addition, increased frequency of cleaning may be needed in a PE to minimize dust accumulation.11 Special recommendations for cleaning and disinfecting environmental surfaces in dialysis centers have been published previously.18 In all health care settings, administrative, staffing, and scheduling activities should prioritize the proper cleaning and disinfection of surfaces that could be implicated in transmission. During a suspected or proven outbreak in which an environmental reservoir is suspected, routine cleaning procedures should be reviewed, and the need for additional trained cleaning staff should be assessed. Adherence should be monitored and reinforced to promote consistent and correct cleaning.",

Effective methods for visitor screening in health care settings have not yet been studied, however. Visitor screening is especially important during community outbreaks of infectious diseases and for high-risk patient units. Sibling visits are often encouraged in birthing centers, postpartum rooms, pediatric inpatient units, PICUs, and residential settings for children; in hospital settings, a child visitor should visit only his or her own sibling. Screening of visiting siblings and other children before they are allowed into clinical areas is necessary to prevent the introduction of childhood illnesses and common respiratory infections. Screening may be passive, through the use of signs to alert family members and visitors with signs and symptoms of communicable diseases not to enter clinical areas. More active screening may include the completion of a screening tool or questionnaire to elicit information related to recent exposures or current symptoms. This information is reviewed by the facility staff, after which the visitor is either permitted to visit or is excluded.832\n",

Covering sneezes and coughs and placing masks on coughing patients are proven means of source containment that prevent infected persons from dispersing respiratory secretions into the air.107, 145, 897, 898 Masking may be difficult in some settings, (eg, pediatrics), in which case the emphasis by necessity may be on cough etiquette.899 Physical proximity of < 3 feet has been associated with an increased risk for transmission of infections through the droplet route (eg, N meningitidis\n103 and group A streptococcus114) and thus supports the practice of distancing infected persons from others who are not infected. The effectiveness of good hygiene practices, especially hand hygiene, in preventing transmission of viruses and reducing the incidence of respiratory infections both within and outside900, 901, 902 health care settings is summarized in several reviews.558, 716, 903\n",

The primary breaches in infection control practice that contributed to these outbreaks were reinsertion of used needles into a multiple-dose vial or solution container (eg, saline bag) and use of a single needle/syringe to administer intravenous medication to multiple patients. In 1 of these outbreaks, preparation of medications in the same workspace where used needle/syringes were dismantled also may have been a contributing factor. These and other outbreaks of viral hepatitis could have been prevented by adherence to basic principles of aseptic technique for the preparation and administration of parenteral medications.452, 453 These include the use of a sterile, single-use, disposable needle and syringe for each injection given and prevention of contamination of injection equipment and medication. Whenever possible, use of single-dose vials is preferred over multiple-dose vials, especially when medications will be administered to multiple patients.",

Blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid of all 8 cases yielded streptococcal species consistent with oropharyngeal flora and there were changes in the CSF indices and clinical status indicative of bacterial meningitis. Equipment and products used during these procedures (eg, contrast media) were excluded as probable sources of contamination. Procedural details available for 7 cases determined that antiseptic skin preparations and sterile gloves had been used. However, none of the clinicians wore a face mask, giving rise to the speculation that droplet transmission of oralpharyngeal flora was the most likely explanation for these infections. Bacterial meningitis after myelography and other spinal procedures (eg, lumbar puncture, spinal and epidural anesthesia, intrathecal chemotherapy) has been reported previously.905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 910, 911, 912, 913, 914 As a result, the question of whether face masks should be worn to prevent droplet spread of oral flora during spinal procedures (eg, myelography, lumbar puncture, spinal anesthesia) has been debated.915, 916 Face masks are effective in limiting the dispersal of oropharyngeal droplets917 and are recommended for the placement of central venous catheters.918 In October 2005, HICPAC reviewed the evidence and concluded that there is sufficient experience to warrant the additional protection of a face mask for the individual placing a catheter or injecting material into the spinal or epidural space.",

The application of Contact Precautions for patients infected or colonized with MDROs is described in the 2006 HICPAC/CDC MDRO guideline.926 Contact Precautions also apply where the presence of excessive wound drainage, fecal incontinence, or other discharges from the body suggest an increased potential for extensive environmental contamination and risk of transmission. A single-patient room is preferred for patients who require Contact Precautions. When a single-patient room is not available, consultation with infection control personnel is recommended to assess the various risks associated with other patient placement options (eg, cohorting, keeping the patient with an existing roommate). In multipatient rooms, \u2265 3 feet spatial separation between beds is advised to reduce the opportunities for inadvertent sharing of items between the infected/colonized patient and other patients. HCWs caring for patients on Contact Precautions wear a gown and gloves for all interactions that may involve contact with the patient or potentially contaminated areas in the patient's environment. Donning PPE on room entry and discarding before exiting the patient room is done to contain pathogens, especially those that have been implicated in transmission through environmental contamination (eg, VRE, C difficile, noroviruses and other intestinal tract pathogens, RSV).54, 72, 73, 78, 273, 274, 739\n",

The preferred placement for patients who require Airborne Precautions is in an AIIR, a single-patient room equipped with special air handling and ventilation capacity that meet the AIA/Facility Guidelines Institute standards for AIIRs (ie, monitored negative pressure relative to the surrounding area; 12 air exchanges per hour for new construction and renovation and 6 air exchanges per hour for existing facilities; air exhausted directly to the outside or recirculated through HEPA filtration before return).12, 13 Some states require the availability of such rooms in hospitals, emergency departments, and nursing homes that care for patients with M tuberculosis. A respiratory protection program that includes education about use of respirators, fit testing, and user seal checks is required in any facility with AIIRs. In settings where Airborne Precautions cannot be implemented due to limited engineering resources (eg, physician offices), masking the patient, placing the patient in a private room (eg, office examination room) with the door closed, and providing N95 or higher-level respirators or masks if respirators are not available for HCWs will reduce the likelihood of airborne transmission until the patient is either transferred to a facility with an AIIR or returned to the home environment, as deemed medically appropriate. HCWs caring for patients on Airborne Precautions wear a mask or respirator, depending on the disease-specific recommendations (see Section II.E.4, Table 2, and Appendix A), that is donned before room entry. Whenever possible, nonimmune HCWs should not care for patients with vaccine-preventable airborne diseases (eg, measles, chickenpox, smallpox).",

The latter is based on molecular typing studies that have found indistinguishable strains of Aspergillus terreus in patients with hematologic malignancies and in potted plants in the vicinity of the patients.941, 942, 943 The desired quality of air may be achieved without incurring the inconvenience or expense of laminar airflow.15, 157 To prevent inhalation of fungal spores during periods when construction, renovation, or other dust-generating activities that may be ongoing in and around the health care facility, it has been recommended that severely immunocompromised patients wear a high-efficiency respiratory protection device (eg, an N95 respirator) when they leave the PE.11, 14, 944 The use of masks or respirators by HSCT patients when they are outside of the PE for prevention of environmental fungal infections in the absence of construction has not been evaluated. A PE does not include the use of barrier precautions beyond those indicated for Standard Precuations and Transmission-Based Precautions. No published reports support the benefit of placing patients undergoing solid organ transplantation or other immunocompromised patients in a PE.",

Category IB/IC\nIV.A.2.When hands are visibly dirty, contaminated with proteinaceous material, or visibly soiled with blood or body fluids, wash hands with either a nonantimicrobial soap and water or an antimicrobial soap and water.558\nCategory IA\nIV.A.3.If hands are not visibly soiled, or after removing visible material with nonantimicrobial soap and water, decontaminate hands in the clinical situations described in IV.A.2.a\u2013f. The preferred method of hand decontamination is with an alcohol-based hand rub.561, 974 Alternatively, hands may be washed with an antimicrobial soap and water. Frequent use of an alcohol-based hand rub immediately after handwashing with nonantimicrobial soap may increase the frequency of dermatitis.558\nCategory IB\nPerform hand hygiene:IV.A.3.a.Before having direct contact with patients.663, 975\nCategory IB\nIV.A.3.b.After contact with blood, body fluids or excretions, mucous membranes, nonintact skin, or wound dressings.663\nCategory IA\nIV.A.3.c.After contact with a patient's intact skin (eg, when measuring pulse or blood pressure or lifting a patient).167, 976, 977, 978\nCategory IB\nIV.A.3.d.If hands will be moving from a contaminated body site to a clean body site during patient care.

Do not wear the same pair of gloves for the care of more than 1 patient. Do not wash gloves for the purpose of reuse, because this practice has been associated with transmission of pathogens.558, 727, 740, 741, 742, 986\nCategory IB\nIV.B.2.d.Change gloves during patient care if the hands will move from a contaminated body site (eg, perineal area) to a clean body site (eg, face).

Category II\nIV.B.3.c.Routine donning of gowns on entrance into a high-risk unit (eg, ICU, NICU, HSCT unit) is not indicated.364, 746, 747, 748, 749\nCategory IB\n\nIV.B.4.Mouth, nose, and eye protectionIV.B.4.a.Use PPE to protect the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth during procedures and patient care activities that are likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions, and excretions. Select masks, goggles, face shields, and combinations of these according to the need anticipated by the task to be performed.113, 738, 779, 895\nCategory IB/IC\n\nIV.B.5.During aerosol-generating procedures (eg, bronchoscopy, suctioning of the respiratory tract [if not using in-line suction catheters], endotracheal intubation) in patients who are not suspected of being infected with an agent for which respiratory protection is otherwise recommended (eg, M tuberculosis, SARS, or hemorrhagic fever viruses), wear one of the following: a face shield that fully covers the front and sides of the face, a mask with attached shield, or a mask and goggles (in addition to gloves and gown).93, 94, 95, 96, 113, 126, 134\nCategory IB\n\nIV.C.Respiratory hygiene/cough etiquetteIV.C.1.Educate HCWs on the importance of source control measures to contain respiratory secretions, to prevent droplet and fomite transmission of respiratory pathogens, especially during seasonal outbreaks of viral respiratory tract infections (eg, influenza, RSV, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus) in communities.10, 14, 24, 261, 683\nCategory IB\nIV.C.2.Implement the following measures to contain respiratory secretions in patients and accompanying individuals who have signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection, beginning at the point of initial encounter in a health care setting (eg, triage, reception and waiting areas in emergency departments, outpatient clinics, and physicians' offices).20, 24, 145, 901, 987\nIV.C.2.a.Post signs at entrances and in strategic places (eg, elevators, cafeterias) within ambulatory and inpatient settings with instructions to patients and other persons with symptoms of respiratory infection to cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing, use and dispose of tissues, and perform hand hygiene after hands have been in contact with respiratory secretions. Category II\nIV.C.2.b.Provide tissues and no-touch receptacles (eg, foot pedal\u2013operated lid or open, plastic-lined wastebasket) for disposal of tissues.20\nCategory II\nIV.C.2.c.Provide resources and instructions for performing hand hygiene in or near waiting areas in ambulatory and inpatient settings; provide conveniently located dispensers of alcohol-based hand rubs and, where sinks are available, supplies for handwashing.558, 901\nCategory IB\nIV.C.2.d.During periods of increased prevalence of respiratory infections in the community (as indicated by, eg, increased school absenteeism, increased number of patients seeking care for respiratory infection), offer masks to coughing patients and other symptomatic persons (eg, persons who accompany ill patients) on entry into the facility or medical office126, 898, 899 and encourage them to maintain special separation (ideally, at least 3 feet) from others in common waiting areas.20, 23, 103, 111, 114, 134\nCategory IB\nIV.C.2.d.i.Some facilities may find it logistically easier to institute this recommendation year-round as a standard of practice.
