About a third of patients with HLH have a monogenetic predisposition affecting lymphocyte cytotoxicity, including familial hemophagocytic syndromes (FHL2\u20105) 2, several albinism syndromes with immunodeficiency (GS2, CHS, HPS2) 3 and X\u2010linked lymphoproliferative syndromes (XLP1+2) 4. These conditions can be summarized as 1\u00b0HLH. EBV infection is a key trigger of the HLH syndrome in XLP, but EBV and other viral or bacterial infections can also trigger disease in patients with FHL or albinism syndromes 5. However, in most FHL patients under the age of one year routine microbiological investigations do not detect an infectious agent in our German cohort. Therefore, it remains unclear if and which trigger is required for disease manifestation in these patients.",

About a quarter of 2\u00b0HLH patients have underlying diseases associated with immune activation such as autoimmune or autoinflammatory disease or malignancy 9. In these cases, infections, in particular with viruses, are frequent additional disease triggers. Secondary HLH induced by various infections, most prominently EBV and leishmania 1, without obvious underlying disease, are responsible for an additional 50% of cases with 2\u00b0 HLH.

This is reflected by infiltrations of T cells and macrophages in HLH target organs such as the liver 10, bone marrow, and brain, as well as by the detection of excessive levels of inflammatory cytokines produced by these cells 11. Studies in perforin knock\u2010out mice have shown that T cells, mainly CD8+ T cells are critical for disease pathogenesis 12. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations are significantly more activated in virus\u2010infected mice with genetic defects of cytotoxicity than in virus\u2010infected controls 13. These studies have defined T\u2010cell hyperactivation as a key feature of 1\u00b0HLH providing a rationale for treatment approaches mainly targeting activated T cells such as ATG 14, etoposide 15 or alemtuzumab 16. It remains far from clear, however, whether activated T cells are as important in 2\u00b0HLH. Elevated sCD25 is frequently taken as indirect evidence of T\u2010cell activation in HLH, but CD25 can also be shed from other cells including non\u2010hematopoetic cells 17, 18 and its correlation to cellular markers of T\u2010cell activation remains to be examined.",

Only three of these patients had proven viral infections, two with EBV and one with CMV. Thirty patients were classified as 2\u00b0 HLH, all without infections. They included 12 patients with MAS, 1 patient with metabolic disease, 1 patient with osteopetrosis and A91V mutation in perforin and 16 patients who could not be assigned a clear underlying disease. Thirty\u2010two patients were classified as 2\u00b0 V\u2010HLH, 4 of them had underlying diseases. Among these 32 patients, 19 had evidence of acute EBV infection by serology and/or PCR. Other acute viral infections diagnosed in the context of HLH by PCR included CMV (4), ParvovirusB19 (3), Adenovirus (2), HHV6 (2), Coronavirus (1), Parainfluenza (1), HSV (1), RSV (1). Two patients had positive PCR for two viruses (HHV6+CMV and EBV+CMV) (Supporting Information Table 1a). HLA\u2010DR expression on CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD4+ T cells and sCD25 levels (by chemoluminescence) from the serum, were measured in all 93 patients, since the age\u2010dependent variability of HLA\u2010DR expression and sCD25 level in healthy donors is limited. For all other investigations, we only included patients younger than one year (18 1\u00b0HLH, 6 2\u00b0HLH, 6 2\u00b0V\u2010HLH) because of the extensive variability in T\u2010cell differentiation marker expression beyond that age.",

We analyzed HLA\u2010DR expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients with active HLH (n = 93) in the absence of immunosuppressive therapy. This included patients with 1\u00b0 (n = 31) and 2\u00b0HLH with (n = 32) or without documented viral infection (n = 30) as summarized in Table 1. Irrespective of age, healthy donors show HLA\u2010DR expression on CD4+ or CD8+ T cells below 12% 21, 22 (Fig. 1A). The proportion of T cells with increased HLA\u2010DR expression was significantly higher in patients with HLH. Among CD8+ T cells, this was moderate (mean 21%) in patients with 2\u00b0HLH in the absence of an apparent infection, but much higher (median 61.5%) in patients with 2\u00b0HLH triggered by a virus infection (2\u00b0V\u2010HLH) as well as in patients with 1\u00b0HLH (mean 64.4%) (Fig. 1B, upper panel). T\u2010cell activation was not significantly different between the 19 patients with EBV\u2010associated HLH and the 13 patients with HLH in the context of other viral infections (data not shown). Interestingly, the pattern of HLA\u2010DR expression was different among CD4+ T cells, which showed a moderate increase in the fraction of HLA\u2010DR expressing cells in both groups of 2\u00b0 HLH patients (mean 8.7 and 12%), while it was much higher (mean 37.8%) in patients with 1\u00b0HLH (Fig. 1B, lower panel). We performed ROC analysis to determine the cut\u2010off for optimal sensitivity and specificity of HLA\u2010DR in discriminating between healthy donors and patients with any form of active HLH. A percentage of HLA\u2010DR expression below 14% among CD8+ T cells and 5% among CD4+ T cells achieved sensitivities and specificities well above 80%. However, HLA\u2010DR expression could not differentiate between 1\u00b0 and 2\u00b0V\u2010HLH (Fig. 1C).",

It therefore remains unclear to which extent sCD25 levels reflect T\u2010cell activation in different HLH conditions. sCD25 serum levels were highly elevated in all three groups of patients. However, 1\u00b0HLH patients had significantly higher serum levels of sCD25 (all above 6000 U/mL) compared to both 2\u00b0HLH groups (Fig. 1D). Unexpectedly, there was a poor correlation between HLA\u2010DR expression on CD4+ or CD8+ cells and sCD25 levels in all patient groups (Fig. 1 E,F). The only significant correlation was observed between the fraction of HLA\u2010DR+CD8+ T cells and sCD25 levels in patients with 1\u00b0 HLH (Fig. 1F).

Since the variability of the percentage of na\u00efve and memory cells increases with age 25, we restricted our analysis to patients and controls younger than one year of age (Supporting Information Table 1B). Patients with 2\u00b0HLH without apparent infection (n = 6) had about 90% na\u00efve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, similar to healthy controls and to asymptomatic patients with 1\u00b0HLH. In contrast, the majority of CD8+ T cells had an effector\u2010memory phenotype in about 60% of patients with 1\u00b0HLH and 50% of patients with 2\u00b0V\u2010HLH (n = 6). Advanced T\u2010cell differentiation was less pronounced among CD4+ T cells, where a predominant effector\u2010memory phenotype was observed in 14.5% in patients with 2\u00b0V\u2010HLH. Notably, this was more pronounced in patients with 1\u00b0HLH (35%) (Fig. 2B). Overall, the pattern of T\u2010cell activation was variable between different individuals (Supporting Information.

However, disease states meeting all current diagnostic criteria for the syndrome of HLH can occur without obvious evidence of T\u2010cell activation. Second, the pattern of CD8+ T\u2010cell activation in 1\u00b0HLH, in most cases in the apparent absence of a microbial trigger, is very similar to that in 2\u00b0HLH triggered by a viral infection. Third, strong activation of cytotoxic CD4+ T cells is a signature of 1\u00b0HLH that is much less pronounced in virus\u2010triggered 2\u00b0HLH. These findings are relevant for understanding the pathogenesis of different HLH variants and have implications for their differential diagnosis.",

However, this has not been analyzed in larger cohorts with clearly defined disease subtypes and the current possibilities to confirm genetic disease. Here, we observed a strong activation of the CD8+ T\u2010cell compartment in patients with 2\u00b0V\u2010HLH and 1\u00b0HLH, while this was less pronounced in patients with 2\u00b0 HLH in the absence of infections, including patients with MAS. In some infants, disease states fulfilling all current clinical criteria of 2\u00b0 HLH even occurred in the absence of any measurable T\u2010cell activation. In patients with 1\u00b0HLH and 2\u00b0 V\u2010HLH, activation was polyclonal with a mild perturbation of the normal repertoire. A large fraction of CD8+ T cells had a CCR7\u2212CD45RA\u2212 effector memory phenotype that was associated with downregulation of CD127, and upregulation of HLA\u2010DR, PD\u20101, CD57, and perforin. This differentiation pattern is similar to that of virus\u2010specific CD8+ T cells in patients undergoing an acute virus infection in the absence of HLH. In CMV infection, the percentage of CD127\u2212 cells correlates with the level of viral replication 34 and incomplete virus control increases the fraction of CD57+ CD8+ T cells 26. CD57 defines T cells with a high lytic granule content and cytotoxic activity 27. Thus, the CD8+ T cell phenotype that was highly represented in 1\u00b0HLH and 2\u00b0 V\u2010HLH (CCR7\u2212 CD45RA\u2212 CD127\u2212 HLA\u2010DR+ PD\u20101+ CD57+ and perforin+) is a phenotype that is also observed in patients with highly active, uncontrolled viral infections in the absence of features of HLH 35, 36, 37.",

This was less than expected from a previously reported cohort of 122 patients with HLH, in which 25 patients with a positive family history were reported to have an infectious trigger 5. Obviously, although in most patients an extensive search for systemic viral infections including EBV, CMV, adenovirus, HHV\u20106, and HHV\u20108 and Parvovirus has been performed, these investigations do not rule out all infections, particularly with respiratory or gastrointestinal viruses. It is unclear, however, whether a local infection without systemic spread is sufficient to trigger and maintain the very strong systemic T\u2010cell activation observed in 1\u00b0HLH. At least in perforin\u2010deficient PKO mice, only systemic persistent infection with LCMV or MCMV can induce HLH 12, 38, while local infections with respiratory viruses (RSV, pneumonia virus of mice, influenza) do not cause HLH in PKO mice 39. Overall, it therefore remains a relevant possibility that the highly activated T\u2010cell phenotype observed in human 1\u00b0HLH is in most cases not driven by a persisting viral (or other microbial) infection. This would imply that in humans, perforin\u2010mediated control of T\u2010cell stimulation is required for maintenance of T\u2010cell homeostasis even in the absence of continued viral stimulation.",

In 1\u00b0HLH, the percentage of CD4+ T cells with a highly activated HLA\u2010DR+CD127\u2212PD1+CD57+perforin+ phenotype was higher than in 2\u00b0V\u2010HLH. Although perforin\u2010expressing CD4+ T cells with cytotoxic activity have been described in persistent virus infections such as HIV, EBV and CMV infections 28, 40 in none of these conditions these cells reach the levels we observed in primary HLH. The stronger activation of CD4+ T cells in 1\u00b0HLH than in 2\u00b0V\u2010HLH suggests qualitative differences in the activation of T\u2010cell populations. Thus, the cytotoxicity defect and the associated impaired elimination of stimulating APC 41 could favor additional recruitment of CD4+ T cells into the inflammatory response through prolonged presentation of antigen via MHC class II. What is the function of the cytotoxic CD4+ T cells? It has been speculated that they play a role in containing viral infections tropic for MHC class II positive cells such as EBV in B cells 40. They could also take over a prominent role in antiviral responses to pathogens that have evolved mechanisms to evade antigen presentation on MHC class I molecules 42. However, in view of the above considerations, it is also conceivable that these cytotoxic CD4+ T cells have a role in human T\u2010cell homeostasis that is independent of infection control, e.g. by controlling APC 41.",

In fact, we have recently documented similar sCD25 levels in immunodeficient patients fulfilling clinical HLH criteria that completely lacked T and NK cells 6. In the current study, we have formally labeled these patients as 2\u00b0HLH, but as discussed previously, it is questionable whether the hemophagocytic inflammatory syndrome in these patients should really be called HLH. This study further illustrates, that the current clinical criteria for HLH cannot differentiate between T cell driven disease (\u201cbona fide\u201d HLH) and hemophagocytic syndromes without T\u2010cell activation 6. Because of obvious implications for therapy, in particular if targeting T cells, a revision and prospective validation of the diagnostic criteria is needed. Our data suggest that inclusion of markers of T\u2010cell activation should be considered.
