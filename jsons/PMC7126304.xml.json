As with other CoV, including SARS CoV, the exact epidemiology, including whether there are larger numbers of mild illness, remains unknown. Males over 60 yrs of age seem to be at higher risk of severe disease symptoms and death among those infected. While the greatest spike in cases occurred near 2014, new cases continue to be reported.

Structural proteins include spike (S), envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N, and membrane (M) protein [9]. MERS CoV attaches to the host cell functional receptor human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDDP4). The most immunogenic of the four structural proteins is the S protein, which is the virus\u2019 only surface glycoprotein \u2013 it mediates viral attachment and fusion via the hDDP4. Since this receptor is widely found in endothelial and subendothelial tissues in lungs, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), and kidneys, this may at least in part explain the associated multisystem organ failure associated with severe cases.",

Of the 24, there were 20 healthcare workers that came into contact with the patient. Human to human transmission is well documented, mostly nosocomial outbreaks, but propagated transmission seems to be limited. Healthcare associated clusters of MERS CoV are associated with most reported cases [10], [11], [12]. The estimated Ro or reproductive rate is estimated at 0.7 [7], [13], [14], although in health care settings it is estimated at >1; still low when compared with measles, a highly contagious viral illness with Ro 12 \u2013 18 [15]. That notwithstanding, the risk of human to human transmission for MERS CoV or other infections cannot be understated. Not surprisingly, diagnosis has been delayed in certain regions that suffer from overcrowding and poor infection control measures. MERS CoV is still considered a risk for epidemics in Saudi Arabia.",

Camel to human transmission is known [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Research suggests MERS CoV originated in bats before camels which may be the intermediate host. Closely related CoV have been found in bats from other regions [23], [24]. For example, a novel CoV found in a vesper bat from South Africa is very similar to MERS CoV, differing by only one amino acid. Studies suggest dromedary camels are the primary source for human infection. Nearly 67% of human cases are male, and the median age among reported cases is 52 [7]. The majority of cases are of Middle East origin, even though cases have been reported from outside the region, where they likely are seeking care, or are returning from travels. A CoV similar to the MERS CoV cases has been found in Camels from Egypt, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Direct contact with saliva of infected camels, or consuming milk or meat from same are considered a risk factor. One study noted the seroprevalence of MERS CoV is several times higher in people with regular exposure to camels compared with the general population [17], [18], [19] although there are cases w/out contact with sick animals or products derived from them.",

Some studies have shown MERS CoV is associated with an attenuated interferon (IFN) response, and does not induce inflammatory cytokines [7], [32], [33]. However a study by Lau demonstrated delayed Proinflammatory cytokine induction by MERS CoV in Calu 3 cells, while there was a lack of production of antiviral cytokines TNF alpha, IFN beta, and IP 10 (5). TNF alpha is noted as an important acute phase pyrogen that inhibits viral replication. IFN beta can induce antiviral response via upregulation of host factors. By attenuating TNF alpha and IFN beta MERS CoV in comparison to SARS CoV may more readily evade innate antiviral host immunity. The possibility that MERS CoV attenuates innate immunity while inducing an inflammatory response in human lung epithelial cells also exists. A macaque model for MERS CoV revealed the virus caused localized to widespread pneumonia in all infection animals. MERS CoV was noted by Lau et al to increase IL 8. In RSV, higher levels of IL 8 seems to correlate with increased disease severity.",

One attempt which shows early animal efficacy is by a vaccine candidate consisting of chimeric virus-like particles (VLP) expressing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV. The researchers have fused canine parvovirus (CPV) VP2 structural protein gene with the RBD of MERS-CoV; it self-assembles into chimeric, spherical VLP (sVLP). This sVLP retained certain parvovirus characteristics, such as the ability to agglutinate pig erythrocytes, and structural morphology similar to CPV virions. Immunization with sVLP induced RBD-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. sVLP-specific antisera from these animals were able to prevent pseudotyped MERS-CoV entry into susceptible cells, with neutralizing antibody titers reaching 1: 320. Of note, Interferon (IFN) - IFN-\u03b3, IL-4 and IL-2 secreting cells induced by the RBD were detected in the splenocytes of vaccinated mice by ELISpot. Mice given sVLP or an adjuvanted sVLP vaccine elicited T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated immunity. Although early stage, research sVLP displaying the RBD of MERS-CoV may become, or lead to an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV. Human research is needed [41].",
