The presence of hypertension was defined by a self-report of the doctor\u2019s diagnosis, the use of antihypertensive medications, or an average blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg or higher. Other comorbidities including stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, angina, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema were ascertained by self-report. Cardiovascular disease was defined if participants had stroke, myocardial infarction, angina, coronary heart disease, or congestive heart failure, whereas lung disease was defined if participants had asthma, chronic bronchitis, or emphysema. Kidney disease was defined by a history of kidney problem or hemodialysis, an estimated creatinine clearance of less than 60 mL/min (using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula), or the presence of microalbuminuria (spot urine microalbumin to creatinine ratio \u226530 mg/g). Thyroid dysfunction was defined by current use of thyroid medications (thyroid hormone or antithyroid agents) or abnormal thyroxine level (T4 < 5.4 or T4 > 12.8 \u03bcg/dL). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height square (m2). Plasma homocysteine was measured by an automated fluorescence polarization immunoassay method with the Abbott IMX system and the Abbott Axsym system (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL). Serum vitamin B12 and red blood cell folate levels were measured using the Bio-Rad Laboratories folate/vitamin B12 radioassay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). C-reactive protein (CRP) was quantified by latex-enhanced nephelometry with a Dade Behring Nephelometer II Analyzer System (Dade Behring Diagnostics, Inc., Somerville, NJ). Plasma fibrinogen concentration was determined by the Clauss clotting method with an STA Compact Analyzer (Diagnostica Stago, Parsippany, NJ). Total cholesterol, serum thyroxine level, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and uric acid were measured with Hitachi analyzers (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). The participants were identified to have recent exercise hobby if they did moderate or vigorous activities for at least 10 minutes in leisure time or muscle-strengthening activities over past 30 days. Current smoker was determined by plasma cotinine level of 14 ng/mL or greater. Alcohol intake was determined by asking \u201cIn any 1 year, have you had at least 12 drinks of any type of alcohol beverage?\u201d and was dichotomized.",

We further calculated the differences of DSST score (\u03b2 coefficients) while stratified on each of the baseline characteristics to investigate whether the association between HAV seropositivity and DSST performance was similar across participant subgroups, as defined by a range of baseline characteristics. Effect modifications of baseline characteristics on the association between DSST performance and HAV seropositivity were examined by creating interaction terms, namely, Baseline Characteristics \u00d7 HAV Status, in linear regression.

This indicates that HAV infection may play a role in the decline of cognitive function or persons with lower cognitive performance may have increased risk for HAV infection. In our study, we have such strength as using a large national representative sample and comprehensive consideration of covariates. Several reports previously investigated the prevalence of HAV infection among people with intellectual disability. Williamson and colleagues (24) reported that the prevalence of HAV antibody in residents of institutions for intellectual disability was higher than that in the general population. Poovorawan and colleagues (25) demonstrated a high prevalence (92%) of HAV antibody among the young residents in the Institute for the Mentally Handicapped. These reports were in line with the negative association between HAV infection and cognitive function; however, they had weakness in terms of small sample size and external validity. Participants of the previous reports were confined to small groups of intellectual disabled patients. Moreover, no cognitive test was administered in any of the studies. To our knowledge, our study is the first report to describe the association between HAV infection and cognitive function among community-dwelling older adults using a large group of geographically dispersed and ethnically diverse national population-based sample. Potential confounders affecting cognition were comprehensively considered.",

Possible explainable factors include lifestyle, environment, inflammatory, and immunologic effects of HAV infection on brain damage and co-occurred complications of acute HAV infection. With regard to lifestyle and environmental factors, HAV-seropositive participants in our study tended to live in a poorer environment and pay less attention to health on the account of lower education level, lower annual family income, lower level of folate, and less exercise activity. We did not adjust for other factors associated with poor environment and unhealthy behavior, such as lead poisoning or illicit drug use. In aspects of comorbidities, we observed a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus in HAV-seropositive participants, whereas no significant differences in cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. Indeed, neither biologic findings in the atheromatous plaque (26) nor longitudinal reports from the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation studies (27) supported the notion that exposure to HAV might be associated with an excess risk for atherosclerosis or cardiovascular events. In contrast, because the majority of the diabetic participants in our study were affected with type 2 diabetes, a high prevalence of HAV seropositivity among the diabetic elders implies a possible interplay between HAV infection and type 2 diabetes. Wang and colleagues (28) recently reported a related finding that HCV infection was an independent predictor of type 2 diabetes. Although the mechanistic relationship between HAV infection and cognitive dysfunction is still unclear, direct demyelination and disruption in tryptophan metabolism were implicated in HCV-infected patients with neurological or psychological manifestations (29\u201331). Altogether, future research effort to provide a deeper understanding of the association between HAV infection and cognitive dysfunction is needed.",

            "text": "Our study has the following limitations that deserve comments. First, the cross-sectional nature of data does not allow any causal inference. The relationship between cognitive function and HAV infection should be studied prospectively, and more studies are needed to clarify if direct effects of HAV on cognitive function exist. Second, we relied on self-report to ascertain medical comorbidities and health-related behaviors. Such variables were potentially affected by depression, which was not examined in the NHANES participants older than 60 years. Third, some possible confounding factors such as hepatitis E virus (HEV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections were unknown in our study population. HEV is transmitted through the fecal\u2013oral route and may have neurological or extrahepatic manifestations as HAV (2,34). Homosexual men and drug users are at increased risk for HAV and HIV infections (35). HIV infection is related to persistent and progressive changes in emotional and cognitive functions (36). However, because data on HIV and HEV infections among the NHANES participants older than 60 years were not available, the possibility of coinfection cannot be excluded. Fourth, the DSST was the only neurocognitive test in the NHANES 1999\u20132002, so we had no other neurocognitive tests for comparison. Finally, we had no information about the time when participants were infected with HAV, so we could not know when participants with seropositive HAV had lower cognitive function after infection.",
