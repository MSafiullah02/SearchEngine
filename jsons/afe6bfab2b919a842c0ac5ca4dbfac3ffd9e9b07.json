Bananins are a class of compounds with a unique structural signature incorporating a trioxa-adamantane moiety covalently bound to a pyridoxal derivative to add potential cytoprotective functionality [15] . Several parent adamantane derivatives are already used clinically [16, 17] , although the antiviral activity of the newly developed bananin has not yet been investigated extensively. In vitro assays demonstrated that bananin effectively interferes with SARS-CoV ATPase activity by inhibiting helicase activity. Furthermore, in a cell culture system of SARS-CoV, bananin inhibited viral replication at a half maximal effective concentration of less than 10 lm and a concentration causing 50% of cell death of over 300 lm, suggesting that it represents a promising anti-viral drug candidate [10] . To investigate bananin primary targets, bananin-resistant viruses were selected by culturing SARS-CoV (GZ50 strain; Gen-Bank accession number AY304495) on fetal rhesus monkey kidney cell line FRhK-4 in the presence of high concentrations of this adamantine derivative. The half maximal effective concentration of bananin on these mutant viruses was demonstrated to be more than 50 lm.

Thus, co-immunofluorescense and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed, although no evidence of helicase-membrane protein interaction could be obtained (Doc. S1 and Fig. S1 ).

From a structural point of view, the A68V mutation, occurring in a predicted protein transmembrane region, should exhibit only a minor functional relevance. The case is different for the R124W mutation, which is outside the trans-membrane segments, with the arginyl residue being very conserved in all the available related sequences. Thus, the zero Shannon's entropy value calculated for the totally invariant 124 position of the membrane protein sequence suggests some functional role for such R \u2044 W replacement.

The fact that tertiary and quaternary structures can be predicted for SARS-CoV helicase [13] allows a deeper insight into the function \u2044 structure correlations for native and mutated forms of the viral enzyme. Preliminary analysis on the frequency of amino acid substitutions among the 78 complete sequences of SARS-CoV helicase available from the NCBI databases indicates that S259 and L297 are totally conserved sites.

The fact that the S259 \u2044 L helicase mutant is fully active is consistent with the above hypothesis proposing that this amino acid substitution, which is critical for bananin binding, does not interfere in the interaction of the enzyme with its natural substrates.
