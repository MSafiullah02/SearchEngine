Respiratory infections due to HBoV are systemic, elicit B cell immune responses, and can be diagnosed serologically.

Viral infections of the lower airways are a major cause of morbidity and even mortality in infants and small children. The classical perpetrators are rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and adenovirus, but interesting newcomers, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, and, more recently, human bocavirus (HBoV), also cause severe disease.

However, this cannot be regarded as a general HBoV seroprevalence in this age group because of the fact that all of our children had been enrolled on the basis of their respiratory symptoms. According to PCR, acute HBoV infection has been shown to be most prevalent in children aged 6 months to 3 years [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . It is possible that children \u04406 months of age are protected by maternal antibodies. In our study, however, only 5 children were as young as 5-6 months of age (2 in the coinfection group and 3 in the control group), and none were HBoV seropositive. The seroprevalence seemed to increase with age, reaching a maximum of 52% among children 1-2 years of age and then decreasing to 27% among children 3-5 years of age. This decrease suggests that the denatured antigen, which is inherent to the immunoblot method, might not be recognized by the past immunity antibodies of the older children. Such a time-related conformational dependence is characteristic for the B cell immunity of the B19 virus [27-29, 41, 42] .

To ensure that antibodies to B19 would not cross-react with HBoV (and, thus, interfere with our results), all children were examined for B19 B cell immunity. However, there were more B19 IgG-positive children among the HBoV IgG-negative group than among the HBoV IgG-positive group.

Infections associated with low virus loads were, however, prevalent and were suggested to reflect virus persis-tence. High viral load and viremia were noted mainly in the absence of other respiratory viruses, suggesting a causative role for HBoV in acute wheezing. In the present study, serodiagnostic findings strongly support this causality. A low viral load in the nasopharynx thus seems to be of little clinical significance. Even though the VP2 immunoblot assay used here is not intended to be the final diagnostic tool, our findings clearly show the diagnostic value of serological testing in acute HBoV infection. The diagnostic criteria for a bocavirus infection are currently unsettled. Using only HBoV-positive PCR results in NPAs as the criterion, some cases of acute HBoV infection (evidenced by viremia and/or serodiagnostic findings) would be missed. Furthermore, a number of false diagnoses would be obtained, perhaps as the result of persisting HBoV DNA or mucosal contamination. Serological testing, coupled with quantitative PCR, should be included in diagnostics, as shown here, to strengthen the causal association between HBoV and respiratory disease. With this combination of diagnostic tools, it is now possible to also evaluate other clinical manifestations possibly caused by HBoV, such as pediatric gastroenteritis [45] .
