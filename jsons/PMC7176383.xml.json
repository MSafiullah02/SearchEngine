This approach is particularly relevant in Timor-Leste, a small and young island nation with a fragile health-care system that is a challenging context in which to provide care during the current pandemic. Until March 21, 2020, no confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported in Timor-Leste,2 but we now face the challenge of effectively containing the spread of the virus and minimising the impact of local transmission. At present, all suspected cases are referred to the COVID-19 Isolation Centre in Dili, where patients are tested and isolated pending test results; contacts are traced and isolated. The Ministry of Health releases a daily update on the number of people tested and cumulative numbers of positive and negative cases. Anybody entering Timor-Leste is quarantined for 14 days in facilities advised by the government.",

We also hope that by prioritising urgent care, we can enable health-care systems to function in the face of the growing pandemic and prevent them from becoming overwhelmed by COVID-19-related illness. The screening and triage algorithm will be used in conjunction with a rapid questionnaire to optimise the integration of a new system into an established clinical triage protocol in Timor-Leste, to avoid the creation of new pathways. This approach will also facilitate effective documentation and communication between health-care facilities, and support surveillance efforts. We are cascading this core framework through all national health-care facilities using small teams of doctors and nurses to educate, communicate, and adapt the framework in consultation with local health-care workers. By April 24, 2020, we should have reached every government hospital and community health centre in the country (>80 health-care facilities).",
