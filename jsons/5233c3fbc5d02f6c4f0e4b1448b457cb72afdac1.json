Compared with previous criteria (SIRS and severe sepsis), qSOFA had better discriminative value and hazard ratio for predicting death, ICU admission, and ICU stay longer than 72 hours. The strong prognostic accuracy of qSOFA for mortality was confirmed with an AUROC of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74-0.85), which was greater than that of SIRS and severe sepsis (AUROC, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.59-0.70 for both). This is in line with the Sepsis 3 task force study that reported an AUROC of 0.81 for qSOFA for non-ICU encounters. 8 Recently, 2 retrospective studies also confirmed the good prognostic ability of qSOFA to predict mortality and ICU admission. 10, 11 Following the publication of Sepsis-3, a prospective validation study focused on ED patients was required to support the new recommendations and assist in changing SI conversion factors: To convert bilirubin from mg/dL to \u03bcmol/L, multiply by 17.04; creatinine from mg/dL to \u03bcmol/L, multiply by 88.4; lactate from mmol/L, to mg/dL divide by 0.111. a Sex identification was not available for 7 participants.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 618, "end": 619, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 746, "end": 749, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 750, "end": 752, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "b The Glasgow Coma Scale score ranges from 3 to 15 with a maximum of 4 points for eye response, 5 points for verbal response, and 6 points for motor response. c The P value compares France with all the other countries in the study. d The number of patients for those with white blood cell counts is 872; creatinine values, 861; bilirubin, 624; platelets, 843; lactate values, 640. e Ranges from 0 to 4, with higher scores representing greater severity of the syndrome. f Severe sepsis is defined as a SIRS score of 2 or higher and lactate levels higher than 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL). g Score ranges from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating greater likelihood of having sepsis. h Scores ranges from , 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating greater severity of organ failure. the paradigm. In the cohort with a SIRS score of 2 or more reported herein, the mortality was 11%, and the high sensitivity (93%; 95% CI, 85%-98%) was associated with a poor specificity (27%; 95% CI, 24%-31%). Nearly 75% of patients had at least 2 points of SIRS, but far fewer had lifethreatening organ dysfunction. Similarly, previous studies reported that 68% to 93% of patients admitted in the ICU had at least 2 elements of SIRS. 12-14 This indicates that having 2 or more elements of SIRS does not discriminate well enough for organ dysfunction. The very low mortality rate of patients with qSOFA score less than 2 is a strong argument to replace SIRS without the risk of missing critically ill patients. Moreover, there was no difference in the rate of the falsenegative of SIRS and qSOFA for the prediction of death or ICU stay of more than 72 hours (7%; 95% CI, 4%-10% and 9%; 95% CI, 7%-11%). Although qSOFA was not meant to replace SIRS in the definition of sepsis but rather help clinicians for early detection of sepsis, 15 these results suggest that ED patients with infection and a qSOFA score of 2 or more should be considered for sepsis even in the absence of a SOFA score or more 2. More than 70% of patients with a qSOFA of 2 or more had a SOFA score of at least 2 points as previously reported. 8 Although blood lactate was known to be associated with severe outcome in patients with sepsis, [16] [17] [18] [19] there was no added value of hyperlactatemia to qSOFA in this study. This confirms the findings of the Sepsis-3 task force, which suggested qSOFA performs effectively and there is no added value when stratified by blood lactate level. This along with other findings could result in a complete change of the current clinical approach because the severity of sepsis up until now has been assessed in ED patients using lactate levels. 20, 21 In-hospital death 74 (8) 22 (3) 52 (24) 21 (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) 15 (3) 59 (18) 15 (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) 5 (2) 69 (11) 8 (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) 39 (6) 35 (20) 14 (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) Intensive care unit Admission 131 (15) 58 ( The qSOFA score ranges from 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating greater likelihood of having sepsis.

First, we did not follow up discharged patients and only focused on in-hospital mortality, which was because we used the Sepsis-3 primary end point of in-hospital mortality. It is possible that a discharged patient could have been readmitted or could have died in the first 28 days. Second, the worst value of qSOFA criteria during the ED stay of the patient was recorded. This could have biased the results to a higher qSOFA score. Because the qSOFA can vary in a short time frame, these results could not be extrapolated to the detection of sepsis at the time of the arrival, for instance to be used as a nurse triage tool. A spe-cific study on the value at ED entry should be performed to answer this question. Third, there was a substantial part of missing data regarding laboratory results, so the calculation of SOFA may not be accurate. It is possible that with more complete data, the SOFA score may actually perform better than qSOFA. However, qSOFA seems much more appropriate in the ED as an early detection tool. Similarly, one-third of patients with at least 2 SIRS criteria did not have blood lactate measurement, resulting in a possible misclassification in the severe sepsis category. Fourth, we did not exclude patients with \"do not attempt resuscitation\" status or with set limitations of care, and this could have skewed the mortality rate. Fifth, although the study was adequately powered, only 74 patients met the primary end point, which may be considered relatively low. Sixth, experts could not have been blinded to the value of the components of the scores, and this could have influenced their adjudication as to whether the ED presentation was related to an infection.
