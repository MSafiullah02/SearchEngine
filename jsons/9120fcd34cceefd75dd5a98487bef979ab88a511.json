Numerous studies suggest that efficient replication of many, if not all, viruses essentially depends on a functional UPS. Consequently proteasome inhibitors (PI) have been found to interfere with efficient replication of many viruses. The mechanisms by which the UPS is involved in regulation of replication of individual viruses are different. Depending on the virus the UPS has been shown to be important for entry, transport, gene expression, assembly or egress of the virus. The introduction of proteasome inhibitors in the clinical praxis as anti-cancer or anti-inflammatory drugs now rise the question whether these compounds present a new class of supplementary or even alternative antiviral drugs. The following article will give an short overview on the structure and function of the UPS, the currently available PI and the various aspects of virus UPS interaction. Finally the potential of different PI as antiviral approaches for the treatment of virus infections is discussed.",

            "text": "Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites and thus widely depend on the cellular machinery for replication and transcription as well as protein and energy metabolism. Options for antiviral therapy are limited to drugs targeting virus-encoded enzymes like DNA-or RNA-polymerases which control replication of the viral genome (e.g. inhibitors of herpesvirus polymerase, of HIV reverse transcriptase or RNA-dependent RNA polymerases), proteases which catalyse processing of viral (poly)proteins (e.g inhibitors of HIV protease) or viral proteins which are involved in uncoating and viral egress (e.g. inhibitors of Influenza virus neuraminidase or M2/hemagglutinin fusion). These drugs are highly specific for certain viruses or virus families and show a satisfying overall in vivo tolerance. However, prophylaxis or even broad therapeutic treatment over a long period of time favours evolvement of drug resistant mutants, particularly when the drug dose or the drug itself is suboptimal and reduces virus replication only marginally. The molecular basis for this phenomenon is a high mutation rate of viral genomes (especially of RNA viruses) combined with a high reproduction rate leading to millions of progeny viruses in one generation. Consequently, drug-mediated modulation of specific cellular pathways essentially involved in virus replication represents an attractive complementary or even alternative strategy to block virus multiplication. Cellular genes have much lower mutation rates so that the problem of drug-resistance should be limited. However, drugs modulating cellular pathways may have a higher toxicity and thus undesirable side effects could limit their in vivo utility.",

            "text": "The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the central cellular mediator of regulated protein turnover in living cells. Apart from degradation of misfolded proteins, the proteasome also functions in defined processing of inactive precursor proteins (Ciechanover and Schwartz, 1998) . Furthermore, by catalysing generation of immunogenic peptides for MHC-I presentation, the UPS plays an important role for the MHC-I-restricted cellular immune response against viruses (Kloetzel, 2004) . Moreover, the UPS is essentially involved in regulation of transcription, signalling, cell-cycle, apoptosis and protein sorting which represent crucial processes for viral replication. Therefore, intervention into these elementary cellular processes may have more or less severe consequences for replication of certain viruses. Therefore, it seemed legitimate to investigate whether proteasome inhibitors (PI) are useful complementary or alternative therapeutics for treatment of viral infections for which no or only suboptimal drugs are currently available. A new impetus for these studies was the development of pharmacologically potent PI like PS-341 (Bortezomib) which recently has been introduced in clinical use as an anti-cancer drug in relapsed myeloma patients that are refractory to conventional chemotherapy (Adams, 2002) . The clinical data support that partial and time-limited inhibition of the UPS is a calculable option for therapeutic intervention, even though certain adverse and toxic effects depending on the dose and the individual patient situation might occur (Richardson et al., 2003) .",

The poly-ubiquitinylated proteins are finally recognised by the proteasome for degradation or processing (for details see Fig. 1 , Ciechanova and Schwartz, 1998) . Additionally, the UPS catalyses mono-ubiquitinylation of certain proteins. Mono-ubiquitinylation has been shown to regulate protein function and serves as a signal in protein sorting and membrane receptor recycling but does not target the protein for proteasomal degradation (Fig.1) . Interestingly, processes depending on mono-ubiquitinylation of proteins can be suppressed by PI indicating that they directly or indirectly require proteasome activity (Dupre et al., are two functionally distinct proteasome types -the 20S proteasome and the 26S proteasome. The barrel-shaped 20S proteasome comprises four stacked rings each composed of 7 \u03b1 or \u03b2 homodimeric subunits that enclose a central chamber. The two central \u03b2-rings harbour three main proteolytic activities, a chymotrypsin-like (CT-L) activity that cleaves after large hydrophobic residues, a trypsin-like (T-L) activity that cleaves after acidic residues and a peptidylglutamyl-peptide hydrolysing (PGPH) or caspase-like activity that also cleaves after acidic residues. There are two further activities that cleave after branched-chain residues or small neutral amino acids. The primary sequence of these proteolytically active \u03b2-subunits and their mechanisms of action differ from those of other known cellular proteases. 2001) . present in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of all eukaryotic cells. There Figure 1 : The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The ubiquitin-proteasome system involves a cascade of enzymes which catalyse mono-or poly-ubiquitinylation of substrates starting with ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), followed by ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2) and ubiquitin ligases (E3) which finally mediate covalent conjugation of ubiquitin to the target protein. Repeated cycles of ubiquitin conjugation result in generation of insoluble polyubiquitinylated proteins which are then recognised by the proteasome as mis-folded and damaged proteins and are degraded or processed. Eukaryotic cells contain one E1, several E2 and more than 100 different E3 enzymes. The E3 enzymes are suggested to determine the specificity of ubiquitinylation. Mono-ubiquitinylation of proteins is associated with changes in protein function and plays a role in protein transport and sorting, as well as transcription regulation.",

The p50/p65 heterodimer remains in an inactive state by association with its inhibitors I\u03baB\u03b1 or IkB\u03b2 in the cytoplasm. Various stimuli are able to trigger activation of NF-\u03baB by induction of proteasomedependent I\u03baB degradation following its phosphorylation by the IKK complex and ubiquitinylation by the SCF (Skp1/Cu11/F-box) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Baldwin, 1996; Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000) . The active p50/p65 heterodimer is then translocated into the nucleus where it binds to the promoters of responsive genes. Apart from I\u03baB degradation, the 26S proteasome also controls processing of the NF-\u03baB p105 and p100 precursors to generate the NF-\u03baB p52 and p50 subunits. Furthermore, p50 can be retained in the cytoplasm by binding to its precursor p105. Following stimulation of the cells p105 can be completely degraded by the UPS allowing translocation of p50 into the nucleus (Beinke and Ley, 2004 ).",

Today, a variety of peptide aldehydes with higher potency and increased selectivity towards the 20S proteasome like MG132, MG115 and PSI have been developed. Binding of peptide aldehydes to the active site \u03b2-subunits results in formation of a reversible hemiacetal adduct between the aldehyde group and the hydroxyl group of the N-terminal threonine residue. Due to the highly reactive functional aldehyde group, cross-reactivity with cellular proteases remains a major drawback of this class of inhibitors that limits their in vivo utility. As a strategy to overcome these limitations, boronic acid derivatives of peptide aldehydes with improved selectivity and higher affinity were developed (Adams et al., 1998; Gardner et al., 2000) . Studies on their mode of action revealed that the empty p-orbital of boron accepts the oxygen lone pair of the N-terminal threonine residue to form a stable tetrahedral intermediate. Boronic acid-based inhibitors can be truncated to dipeptides, thus improving important therapeutic characteristics like solubility and membrane permeability. Apart from that, slower dissociation rates of boronic acid peptides lead to a prolonged inhibition of the proteasome. The most common representatives of this class in the context of in vivo studies and clinical applications are MG262 and PS-341 (see below).",

Thus, lactacystin irreversibly inhibits the CT-L and T-L activity of the proteasome. Although it was originally believed to exclusively target the 20S proteasome, there is increasing experimental evidence that lactacystin also inhibits cathepsin A (Ostrowska et al., 2000) .

The most extensively studied inhibitors are PS-341 (Bortezomib, Velcade) and PS-519. Both compounds have been tested as potential therapeutics for oncological and inflammatory conditions. Bortezomib has demonstrated activity in phase II trials as a treatment option for renal cell cancer, lung cancer, sarcoma and lymphoma (Richardson et al., 2003; Davis et al., 2004; Kondagunta et al., 2004; Maki et al., 2005) . Since 2003, bortezomib has been approved for clinical use in patients with multiple myeloma. PS-519 is the most advanced inhibitor in the context of inflammatory diseases like psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, multiple sclerosis, sepsis and vascular restenosis and has entered phase II clinical studies for the indications of acute stroke and myocardial infarction (Phillips et al., 2000; Palombella et al., 1998; Elliott et al., 1999; Kondagunta et al., 2004) .",

The reported side-effects include fatigue and/or low fever, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal symptoms, electrolyte disturbances, headache, anemia, arthralgia, low diarrhea, frequent skin rashes and peripheral neuropathy (Richardson et al., 2003; Davis et al., 2004) . Autoradiography experiments in rats showed that bortezomib is present in all organs except CNS, spinal cord, testes and eyes thus sparing these organs adverse effects of proteasome inhibition. Apart from that, proteasome inhibition by bortezomib is reversible and it could be shown that the inhibitor is rapidly metabolised (Adams, 2002) .

For other viruses, however, the proteasome represents a barrier and a degradative factor. In vitro studies also revealed that the interaction between the UPS and the virus presumably depends on the cell type. Most interestingly, the UPS may play different and even opposing roles during different stages of virus replication. Consequently, virus replication is either PI-sensitive or -insensitive and proteasome inhibition either suppresses or even supports replication of the virus depending on the specific situation. So far, antiviral effects of PI have been demonstrated in vitro for members of seven virus families -retroviridae, herpesviridae, parvoviridae, picornaviridae, orthomyxoviridae, paramyxoviridae and coronaviridae. For other viruses it has been shown that certain steps in virus replication are controlled by the UPS, however, an antiviral effect of PI has not been demonstrated yet. Involvement of the UPS in the interaction between the virus and cellular metabolism does not necessarily imply that proteasome inhibition blocks virus replication as shown for Adenovirus transcription/translation which depend on the cellular gene expression machinery. Data arise exclusively from in vitro experiments using virusinfected cell cultures. However, preliminary data from animal experiments performed in our laboratory raise the hope that PI do not only suppress virus replication in vitro but also in vivo (Gille, Pr\u00f6sch., unpublished observation, see below).",

Since PI do not influence the entry of Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) and Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) which only require the early and not the late endosome, the target for PI might be localised beyond the early endosome. The exact mechanism of PI-dependent inhibition of influenza virus entry, however, remains unclear up to date. A cellular target for proteasomal degradation seems more likely because viral proteins have not been found to be ubiquitinylated. Similar to influenza virus, PI also suppress entry and nuclear translocation of Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) strain JHM, a murine Coronavirus, into mouse astrocytoma cells (DBT cell line) (Ros and Kempf, 2004) . Treatment of MHV strain JHM infected cells with PI caused a strong accumulation of incoming virus in the early endosome and led to a missorting into the lysosome. MHV may enter its target cells either by plasma membrane fusion or by endocytosis depending on the virus strain and the cell type (Nash and Buchmeier, 1997) . Correspondingly, replication of MHV strain JHM which enters DBT cells via the endocytotic pathway was highly sensitive to proteasome inhibition, while MHV strain A59, which enters the cells by fusion, was less efficiently inhibited by PI.",

The underlying mechanism remains unclear because the proteasome does not seem to be involved in cleavage/processing of capsid protein VP and the virus did not co-localise with the early or late endosomal or the lysosomal compartment. Furthermore, uncoating of parvoviruses occurs in the nuclear core or in the nucleus but not in the cytosol.",

            "text": "Generally, virus budding at the outer plasma membrane follows the same strategy of \"inwards\" budding of membranes into so-called multivesicular bodies and association with the protein trafficking and ubiquitin-vacuolar sorting system. Accordingly, budding of certain retroviruses including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) type 1 and 2, Rous Sarkoma Virus (RSV), Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV) and Mazon Pfizer Monkey Virus (MPMV) as well as the rhabdovirus VSV and the paramyxovirus SV5 was strongly inhibited by PI (Patniak et al., 2000; Schubert, et al., 2000; Strack et al., 2000; Harty et al., 2001; Ott et al., 2003, recently reviewed in Klinger and Schubert, 2005; Schmitt et al., 2005) . Intensive studies on HIV-1 revealed in the absence of a functional UPS retarded budding structures, which accumulated and the released HIV-1 particles were not infectious. It was also shown that processing of the Gag-polyprotein but not the envprecursor, was strongly impaired. As a consequence Gag processing intermediates accumulated in the cell and the intracellular and virusassociated levels of the capsid protein p24 were strongly reduced. Interestingly, the viral protease which normally cleaves the Gag-polyprotein was not targeted by PI Klinger and Schubert, 2005) . Despite intensive investigations, the mechanism of PI-dependent inhibition of HIV budding is not completely understood. Several studies demonstrated that the C-terminal portion of Gag proteins of different retroviruses (e.g. p6 of HIV-1 and SIV Gag, p12 of Mo-MLV Gag, p9 of EIAV Gag) is monoubiquitinylated. The ubiquitin residue was suggested to play a role in function of the L-domains that are present in these proteins and are required for budding (Ott et al., 1998 (Ott et al., , 2002a (Ott et al., and b and 2003 Pornillos et al., 2002) . Since treatment with PI causes an accumulation of polyubiquitinylated proteins, limititation of the endogenous pool of free ubiquitin may prevent Gag ubiquitinylation. However, HIV-1 p6 Gag mutants deficient for ubiquitinylation showed an unchanged phenotype, indicating that ubiquitinylation alone is not sufficient for virus budding . Moreover, mono-ubiquitinylation of Gag alone does not provide an explanation why budding of some retroviruses like Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV) and Mouse Mamma Tumour Virus (MMTV) are insensitive to PI (Patniak et al., 2002; Ott et al., 2003) . The structure of the Gag L-domains and their interaction with different components of the UPSdependent vacuolar protein-sorting system seems to be more crucial for virus budding. Only viruses with proteins containing an L-domain of the PPXYtype (e.g. MuLV, RSV, Ebola virus) or the PTAP type (e.g. HIV-1 and-2) but not of the YXDL-type (e.g. EIAV) are sensitive to PI (Shehu-Xhilaga et al., 2004; Klinger and Schubert, 2005) . By binding to different \"bridging molecules\", L-domains mediate interaction between the viruses and the vacuolar protein-sorting system required for budding. L-domains of the PPXY-type are able to bind different HECT ubiquitin ligases like WWP1, WWP2 or Itch, while L-domains of the PTAP-motif bind Tsg 101 (e.g. HIV, Ebola virus VP40) which then recruits other components of the endosomal sorting system like ESCRT-I,-II,-III and thus connects the Gag protein to the vacuolar protein sorting system (Garrus et al., 2001; Amit et al., 2004; Martin-Serrano et al., 2001 .",

Inhibition of HCMV replication occurs at the immediate early (IE) stage of infection by suppression of the IE gene expression. Virus adsorption as well as entry and trafficking of the capsid/tegument complex into the nucleus are not influenced. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that PI specifically block generation of the IE2 messenger while generation of the IE1 messenger is not affected. Both IE1 and IE2 messengers are generated by different splicing of the IE locus, suggesting that the proteasome may be involved in regulation of IE2 mRNA splicing. In accordance with this it was found that expression and localisation of several splice factors are altered in the absence of a functional UPS (Rockel and Mikecz, 2002) . Since the IE2 protein is essential for induction of early and late viral proteins and for virus-dependent cellular gene expression, PI are detrimental to HCMV replication. The structure of the IE gene locus of RCMV is very similar to that of HCMV regarding its modular composition and splicing processes, thus, it might be assumed that PI inhibit replication of RCMV and HCMV by the same mechanism.",

One example is the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) type 1. Establishment and maintenance of latency in neuronal cells has been found to depend on the proteasomal degradation of the viral UL9 protein which may facilitate reactivation of the virus by binding to and unwinding of the origin 3. UL9 interacts with the neurone specific NFB24 protein and is thus recruited to an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex facilitating its ubiquitinylation and proteasomal degradation. Proteasome inhibition allows accumulation of UL9 and thus induce viral replication/reactivation (Eom and Lehmann, 2003) . Similarly, reactivation of latent integrated HIV may benefit from proteasome inhibition (Krishnan and Zeichner, 2004; Schwartz et al., 1998) . As a reason it has been speculated that key factors required to effectively activate the HIV-l LTR are degraded or repressed in latently infected cells and that their stabilisation by PI then promotes transcription. Accordingly, latently infected cells show increased expression of various proteasome subunits and inhibition of the UPS may restore this process.",

Consequently, PI increased their infectivity by preventing viral degradation during entry. This effect is especially relevant for HIV strains entering the cell by fusion, while strains using the endocytotic pathway are less successible (Wei et al., 2005; Schwartz et al., 2001) . One explanation might be that the proteasome degrades Gag proteins within the cytoplasm. Similarly, PI support transduction of the recombinant AAV (rAAV). Normally, in less efficiently transduced cells incoming virus is effectively degraded by the proteasome (Douar et al., 2001; Hansen et al., 2000; Duan et al., 2000) . Inhibition of the proteasome enhances nuclear accumulation of the virus and viral gene expression (Duan et al., 2000; Jennings et al., 2004) . Since rAAV is of great interest as a vector for gene therapy, proteasome inhibition has demonstrated to promote transgene expression (Yan et al., 2002) .",

All studies so far have been carried out with PI developed as research tools only which are not suitable for clinical use. To evaluate PI as antiviral therapeutics, these experiments have to be confirmed with clinically approved PI like PS-341 and PS-519 and have to be verified in animal settings.

This emphasises the need to develop PI with increased specificity and reduced toxicity. Alternatively, drugs which target the more specific E3 ubiquitin ligases involved in virus UPS interaction should be more specific and less toxic. Development of such compounds, however, requires the knowledge of viral and cellular factors involved in the interaction between virus and UPS. A further question which has to be addressed is the influence of PI on (re)activation of highly prevalent latent or persistent viruses to exclude that treatment of an acute infection with one virus does not trigger reactivation of another virus. This question is also of substantial interest for the use of PI in anti-cancer therapy because persistent viruses like EBV or HCMV are co-factors for tumour genesis.",
