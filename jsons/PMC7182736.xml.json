The phosphatidylinositides exist at low concentration, often for fleeting moments during the signalling cascade, and to add to their complexity interact with a variety of other signalling pathways to regulate metabolism as well as having other fundamental regulatory roles in the cell. These lipids are not for the faint hearted and require a special class of character in terms of dedication, determination and perhaps a sense of optimism if one is to unravel their roles in cellular signalling. Professor Michael Wakelam was one such character who possessed all these qualities as a scientist and pioneered the understanding of the role of lipids in cell signalling.",

            "text": "Michael was educated at the University of Birmingham, undertaking both his undergraduate degree in Medical Biochemistry (1977) and PhD in Biochemistry (1980) at the university. He had a huge affinity for the city and was a great source of information about where to go for the best restaurants I am told by my Birmingham colleagues. He did his first post-doc at the University of Konstanz, Germany and it was here that he studied the fusion of cell membranes in myocytes (Wakelam, 1983). This is a calcium stimulated process and Michael set out to study the role that lipids, and in particular phosphatidylinositols, play within this. Using a combination of radiolabels, thin layer chromatography and Dowex columns, he demonstrated that there was a rapid conversion of phosphatidylinositides to phosphatidic acid and 1,2-diacylglycerol during myoblast fusion. This was an early demonstration of how three lipid signalling pathways can interact to regulate fundamental cellular processes. He then moved to Imperial College London as a Beit Memorial Fellow before joining the University of Glasgow in 1985 as a Lecturer, where he was subsequently promoted to Senior Lecturer and then Reader. While at Glasgow and working with Miles Houslay and colleagues, he examined the role of desensitization of signalling pathways. While every signalling pathway needs to have a mechanism to turn the signal off, glucagon-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in hepatocytes was known to dip shortly after the initial burst of activity of the glucagon pathway (Murphy et al. 1987). In a series of papers Wakelam and Houslay examined this process demonstrating that this was not down to product inhibition through cAMP and instead other signalling pathways interacted to dampen the initial burst of activity. While most studies of the time relied on the incorporation of radioactive labelled substrates such approaches could not discriminate within a class of lipids and address basic questions about whether particular fatty acids made a difference. To address this Michael and Trevor Pettitt developed a 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl derivatisation and HPLC method for the analysis of diradylglycerols, and in particular diacylglycerides (DAGs) (Pettitt and Wakelam, 1993). This allowed them to investigate individual DAGs, identifying pools of polyunsaturated fatty acid containing DAGs that were derived from the phosphatidylinositol pool and a separate group of DAGs derived from phosphatidylcholines. This method still performs very favourably even when compared with the reverse phase approaches most of us use in lipidomics today.",

Here he joined the Cancer Research UK (CRUK) Institute for Cancer Studies and conducted many of his ground breaking studies into the role lipid signalling plays in cancer cell biology. He was also more actively involved in mass spectrometry. In conjunction with the chromatography methods he had co-developed, mass spectrometry began to give a unique insight into how specific lipids contribute to pathways, demonstrating that there is more than just the lipid head group in determining the role of a given lipid. With Robin Irvine of the University of Cambridge and colleagues, the Wakelam group investigated the processes that regulate cell adhesion. For those of us with long memories this was still largely a mystery to the scientific community (and is still not fully understood). Using a combination of GFP-tagged proteins, mass spectrometry of lipids, RNAi knockdown of enzymes and some inventive enzymology they demonstrated that phospholipase D2-derived phosphatidic acid regulates integrin-mediated adhesion through the generation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (Powner et al. 2005).",

I originally met him at a symposium when I was still feeling my way into the lipidomics world and remember his warm words of encouragement and the offer of chatting over a beer about where my work was going. He was a great internal PhD examiner for two of my best PhD students who I think had enjoyable vivas despite appearing at the end intellectually exhausted and quite drained\u2014but in a good way! I hugely enjoyed his company at conferences but I think I will leave the final words to my two former PhD students:Dr. Lee Roberts, now Associate Professor of Molecular Physiology and Metabolism, University of Leeds who commented \u201cHe was very approachable, a complete gentleman and incredibly insightful when it came to discussing science and my PhD work. As my internal PhD examiner he arranged a tea and biscuit break during the viva.
