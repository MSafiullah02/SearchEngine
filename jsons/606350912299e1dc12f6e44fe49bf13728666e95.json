The role of other viral respiratory pathogens has not been studied in this population. YK Delta children <3 years of age hospitalized with respiratory infections and same aged community control children were prospectively enrolled between October 2005 and September 2007. Polymerase chain reaction detection of viruses was performed on nasopharyngeal samples. Characteristics of hospitalized and asymptomatic control children were analyzed. From October 2005 to September 2007, 440 hospitalized and 425 control children were analyzed. Respiratory viruses were detected in 90% (395) of hospitalized children: 194 (44%) rhinovirus, 131 (30%) adenovirus, 102 (23%) RSV, 77 (18%) para influenza viruses (PIV), 66 (15%) human metapneumovirus (hMPV), 23 (5%) influenza, and 25 (6%) coronavirus. Fifty-two percent (221) of control children had a virus detected, most commonly rhinovirus (33%), and adenovirus (16%). RSV, PIV, hMPV, and influenza were significantly more common in hospitalized cases than control children, but rhinovirus, adenovirus, and coronavirus were not. RSV and hMPV were associated with higher severity of illness. In this study, RSV remains the most important virus associated with respiratory hospitalization, although hMPV and PIV were also common. RSV and hMPV were associated with more severe illness. Rhinovirus and adenovirus were detected in two-thirds of hospitalized children, but their frequent detection in control children made their role in respiratory hospitalization uncertain. J. Med.

For Alaska Native children in the Yukon Kuskowkim (YK) Delta, the LRTI hospitalization rate was 284/1,000 infants/year during 1994-1997 [Karron et al., 1999; Singleton et al., 2006] , while the RSV-associated hospitalization rate was 178/1,000 infants/year, a rate five times higher than that reported for the general US infant population. High RSV hospitalization rates and prolonged seasonality led to specific palivizumab recommendations for this population in the 2009 Redbook RSV chapter [Pickering et al., 2009] . Despite a decrease in RSV hospitalizations from 178 to 104/1,000 infants/year between 1997 and 2004, possibly due to increased availability of running water, decreased household smoking, and palivizumab use [Singleton et al., 2003 [Singleton et al., , 2006 , there was little change in the overall infant LRTI hospitalization rate during this period, and three-fourths of LRTI hospitalized cases pathogen had not detected [Singleton et al., 2006] .",

We reviewed individual medical records for underlying medical conditions, respiratory hospitalizations during the year before hospitalization and outpatient respiratory visits during the month before hospitalization. Positive bacterial cultures from normal sterile sites in study children were reported. Disease severity was assessed using a severity index for RSV (1 point each for length of stay >5 days, SaO 2 <87, PCO 2 >45, pH <7.35, or apnea, 2 points for mechanical ventilation) [McConnochie et al., 1990] . Severe disease was defined as an index !2 [McConnochie et al., 1990] .",

During October 1, 2006 through September 30, 2007 (Year 2) we recruited control children regionwide during monthly village recruitment trips. During each monthly trip we enrolled children from three villages in three of six YK Delta subregions for a total of 36 villages. Although control children were not matched for village with cases, each subregion was visited six times during Year 2. We obtained informed consent, administered the questionnaire, reviewed individual medical records, and obtained a NPS using the same method as for hospitalized children.",

To assure comparability between case and control children, the analysis to calculate AFE was restricted to Year 2, when control children were recruited regionwide, and to positive PCR results obtained from the NPS specimen (since only NPS specimens were obtained on control children).

Viruses were detected in 90% of hospitalized cases. While rhinovirus and adenovirus were the most frequently detected viruses, their rate of detection was similar in hospitalized cases and control children, so their contribution to hospitalized illness was uncertain. In contrast, RSV, hMPV, PIV, and influenza (Group 1 viruses) were detected in 55% of hospitalized cases, and few community controls, and the estimated percent of hospitalized cases attributable to these viruses was 45.2%. Sensitive PCR assays make it possible to consistently detect a wide range of respiratory viral pathogens, but a detected virus may be associated with persistence of virus after an earlier illness.

Although RSV hospitalization rates have decreased in YK Delta children, LRTI hospitalization rates have remained relatively stable, suggesting an increasing role of other pathogens.

According to unpublished YKDRH immunization coverage data, approximately half of YK children <3 years of age received influenza vaccine during the study seasons; study numbers were too small to evaluate influenza vaccine protection. Rhinovirus was commonly detected in both hospitalized (44%) and control (33%) children, and the non-positive AFE indicated a lower likelihood of rhinovirus being the causal pathogen. The clinical significance of a positive rhinovirus PCR result has been questioned [Makela et al., 1998 ] since rhinovirus is detected in asymptomatic children [Nokso-Koivisto et al., 2002; Freymuth et al., 2006] , commonly found as a co-pathogen [Aberle et al., 2005] and has been shown to persist in 50% of cases 2 weeks after an acute infection [Jartti et al., 2004] . However, rhinovirus has been identified as the single virus in some LRTIs [Papadopoulus et al., 2002; Guittet et al., 2003] , and in our study there was a trend toward positive association with hospitalization for rhinovirus during summer months.",

Although control children were recruited in a systematic fashion to represent the entire region, a recruitment strategy with matching by time and village may have given a better AFE estimate, but was impractical. Control children were older than case children. We did not do frequency matching; however, age adjustment did not make a difference in the AFE supporting the validity of these results. Since this was a consented study with a recruitment rate of 66%, the enrolled cases may not be representative of all cases. Additionally, the 2 years of the surveillance may not be representative of the overall viral epidemiology.",
