ARDS is usually severe, with Pa0 2/Fi02 < than 150 and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) should be high and optimized according to a mechanical basis. In our experience, we initially select PEEP according to the methods used in the ExPress trial where PEEP was adjusted based on airway pressure and was kept as high as possible without increasing the maximal inspiratory plateau pressure above 28 to 30 cmH 20 [10] . In more severe respiratory failure, we also set PEEP according to the transpulmonary press ure, by using esophageal-pressure measurements. In secondary, but also in primary ARDS the lungs can suffer substantial effects of ehest wall elastance and may be effectively compressed by high pleural pressures with their alveoli collapsed at the end of expiration, even though moderate or high PEEP levels are applied. Therefore, PEEP is set at a level necessary to obtain a positive end-expiratory transpulmonary-pressure to improve the oxygenation, an end -inspiratory transpulmonary-presure less than 20 cmH 20 to minimize stress-inducing ventilator lung injury, and a pulmonary driving pressure (end-inspiratory transpulmonary pressure less end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure)~10 cmH 20 to avoid straininducing ventilator lung injury (Fig. 3 ).

The adjunctive therapies developed to reduce the stress of mechanical ventilation on the already damaged lungs include: Nitric oxide (NO) , extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), arterial venous carbon dioxid e removal, high-frequency oscillatory vent ilation, and liquid ventilation. We prefer to use NO because of its availability and easy impl ementation and we have observed better improvement in oxygenation combining this therapy with prone ventilation, as previously described [12] . Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV): NPPV has been used in respiratory failure due to viral pneumonia, even in cases of high transmission r isk like in the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong [13] . In one study, the efficacy in SARS pneumonia with mild acute lung injury (ALl) was high an d no cases of healthworker infection were observed. However, appli cation of NPPV to patients with HINI influenza has not been well evaluated and it is not indicated for impending respiratory failure. In mild cases or in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or chronic respiratory restriction, NPPV could be useful to support the resp iratory system, but it should be applied in healthcare facilities where staff have been adequately trained and with strict enforcement of personal protection measures; use of expiratory viral and bacterial filters are necessary to provide safer ventilation.",

Antivirals are indicated to prevent the rapid spread of the disease in a specific population, to prevent the pneumonia syndrome in susceptible patients, or to treat patients with influenza pneumonia. For critically ill influenza patients, antiviral treatment options are limited because no parenteral drug is available and no drug has been proved to be effective once life-threatening disease occurs. Currently, four antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of influenza: Amantadine, rimantadine (both cannot be used for the treatment of HINI influenza due to resistance), oseltamivir, available only for oral administration, and zanamivir, available as an inhalation agent; the two latter drugs are both sialic acid analogs that inhibit viral neuraminidases by competitively binding with the active enzyme site of influenza A and B viruses. The neuraminidase is critical for viral release from infected cells after replication. The earlier the administration of these agents, and the shorter the duration of fever, the greater the benefit of drug intervention [14, 15] . Oseltamivir has also been shown to reduce lower respiratory tract complications such as bronchitis and pneumonia [16] . In a prospective case control study, multivariate analysis suggested that treatment with oseltamivir decreased the likelihood of death (odds ratio 0.21 [confidence interval 0.06-0.80, p = 0.02]) [17] . Immunosuppressed patients (leukemia, organ transplantation, and hematopoietic stern cell transplantation) have a higher rate of viral pneumonia and higher attributable mortality [18] ; viral shedding is also prolonged in these patients to an average of 11 days [19] , which is associated with the development of resistance [20] . A standard dose and duration of antivirals may not be adequate in this population; for these reasons, some authors have advocated a higher dose of oseltamivir (300 mg daily) in these patients [18] .",

The most frequent reported adverse effect seen with oseltamivir is nausea and vomiting, but this leads to medication interruption in only a sma11 number of cases. Neuropsychiatrie disorders (seizure, confusion or hyper-excitation of the nervous system) and severe skin reactions (e.g., toxie epidermal necrolysis) are more severe adverse events that have been observed in some cases during the pandemie. These unusual events have been related to a single nucleotide polymorphism in a gene located near the enzymatie active site of human cytosolic sialidase, a homolog of the virus neuraminidase that is the target of oseltamivir. This polymorphism has been found to occur in 9.3 % of the Asian population [21] .",

In one interim analysis of the pandemie in Australia, the authors found that there was no evidence of significant protection from seasonal vaccine against pandemic influenza virus infection in any age group [35] . A new vaccine has been developed, but there have been concerns based on the experience during the 1976 -77 flu season, during whieh a swine flu outbreak at Fort Dix, New Jersey led the federal government to expedite vaccine production. Some 40 million people had been vaccinated by the time Guillain-Barre syndrome was identified as a side effect. However, with the pandemic as a reality, it is considered that the benefit of the vaccine far outweighs the risks,",

The morbidity and mortality caused by this first influenza pandemie in the 21st century, characterized by an unusual increase in the number of cases of primary viral severe community-acquired pneumonia requiring mechanieal ventilation, has been substantial. Interestingly this high er incidence of severe cases appeared in a younger age group than that usually involved in the annual seasonal flu outbreak. The percentage of the population that acquired influenza during this pandemie has not yet been estimated but certainly it was much higher than during seasonal influenza; this higher incidence may explain the high number of cases of severe primary pneumonia observed in the Southern Cone. The apparently less aggressive nature of the infection and the younger population affected may explain an estimated mortality rate of 0.05 -0.1 %, lower than that observed in seasonal influenza, as complications and mortality in seasonal flu are more frequent among patients 2: 65 years old and in those with chronic disorders, including cardiac or pulmonary diseases, diabetes mellitus, hemoglobinopathies, renal dysfunction, and imrnunosuppression, also usually associated with older age. lmproved and standardized optimal leu care for patients with influenza HIN I 2009, including young and immunocompetent patients, with or without comorbidities, should lead to lower mortality than that previously observed for influenza pneumonia when mechanical support is required.",

Consistent with this partieular situation, the health system in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires began to show evidenees of eollapse, use of ventilators inereased eritieally, aehieving an extremely unusuallevel; about a quarter of the available ICU beds were oeeupied by young and previously healthy patients with ARDS associated with severe bilateral pneumonia due to 'swine flu' who needed meehanical ventilation.By the time of writing this ehapter, during the end of the winter in the southern hemisphere, it is evident that pandemie HINI influenza is highly prevalent in South Ameriea. In September 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) Direetor General, Margaret Chan, estimated that up to 30 % of people in densely populated countries risk being infeeted with HINI pandemie 2009 influenza, while Dr, Thomas Frieden, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, predicted that about 800,000 people may potentially have been infeeted in New York City by the spring. These figures are diffieult to extrapolate globally and to eonfirm, as epiderniologieal studies looking at the population at risk in different world areas are laeking, but the huge number of severely ill patients with ARDS due to primary influenza pneumonia (an extremely unusual eomplieation) observed in the Southern Cone, suggest that these estimations eould be realistic. Calculating the population-eorreeted mortality rate from estimations made in New Zealand[5], it ean be inferred that by the end of winter in the southern hemisphere, up to about 40 % of the population in Argentina eould be infeeted by this novel agent.",
