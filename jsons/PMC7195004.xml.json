Globally distributed IBV induces an acute, highly contagious infectious disease affecting chickens and results in huge annual losses in the poultry industry. IBV was first reported in North Dakota, USA, by Schalk and Hawn 1931 (Schalk & Hawn, 1931) as a novel respiratory disease affecting chickens. Only chickens and pheasants act as the natural hosts for IBV (Ignjatovic & Sapats, 2000). IBV initially infects the respiratory tract; for some IBV strains further virus spread may involve kidneys and oviduct causing reduction of growth rate, decreased performance and reduction of egg quality and quantity (Cavanagh, 2003). Also another shift of tissue tropism causing proventriculitis has been recorded (Yu et al., 2001a). The infection spreads by aerosols, direct contact and indirectly through contaminated fomites (Ignjatovic & Sapats, 2000).",

            "text": "IBV harbors a monopartite RNA genome of positive polarity which is approximately 27.6 kb in size and codes for four structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein, the membrane (M) glycoprotein, the nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein, and the envelope (E) protein (Spaan et al., 1988). The N protein is a major structural protein, which is highly conserved among different IBV serotypes. The spike (S) glycoprotein, an integral membrane protein, is another major structural protein of the IBV; it is post translationally cleaved into the S1 (N terminal part) and S2 fragments. In their matured forms the S1 constitutes trimers of the globular head while the S2 forms the trimerized stalk domain of the peplomer spikes in the viral lipid envelop (Cavanagh, 2007, Belouzard et al., 2012). The S1 protein carries the receptors binding site and thus plays an important role in tissue tropism and induction of protective immunity (Belouzard et al., 2012, Wickramasinghe et al., 2011). Along the S1 gene three hypervariable regions (HVRs) are distinguishable that are targets of neutralizing and serotype specific antibodies (Moore et al., 1997, Cavanagh et al., 1988). Variation in these epitopes has been implicated in escape from vaccine-induced immunity (Belouzard et al., 2012).",

Consequently, cross protection between these different serotypes is limited (Jackwood, 2012, Wickramasinghe et al., 2014, Cavanagh, 2005, Kuo et al., 2010). New S1 genotypes of IBV that are often also showing antigenic variation and, hence, define new serotypes, appear to emerge frequently in different parts of the world (Jackwood, 2012). Frequent mutations have been made accountable for the emergence and evolution of multiple S1 variants (Jackwood, 2012, Cavanagh et al., 1992) including point mutations, insertions, deletions, and also recombination between different strains (Adzhar et al., 1997, Hewson et al., 2014). Recombination tends to be not a rare event during IBV replication and the emergence of chimeric viruses harbouring sequences from two or more viruses were reported previously (Jia et al., 1995, Abro et al., 2012).",
