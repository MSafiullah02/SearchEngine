FCoVs are also associated with mild or subclinical enteric infections (Pedersen et al., 1981). Despite the high prevalence of FCoVs in feline populations around the world (Bell et al., 2006, Horzinek and Osterhaus, 1979, Kiss et al., 2000, Pedersen, 1976, Sparkes et al., 1992), only 5\u201312% of seropositive cats develop FIP (Addie and Jarrett, 1992, Addie et al., 1995).",

            "text": "FCoVs are further classified into two serotypes that differ in their growth characteristics in cell culture and antigenicity relative to canine coronaviruses (CCoVs) (Pedersen et al., 1984). Type II FCoVs are the result of recombination between a type I FCoV and CCoV (Herrewegh et al., 1998). Both types of FCoV can cause FIP (Pedersen et al., 1984). Type I and II FCoVs have different cell tropisms that can be explained by differences in the binding specificity of their respective spike proteins (Hohdatsu et al., 1998). Based upon recognized differences in the spike genes of these two virus types, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses has been employed as an alternative method to distinguish between type I and II viruses (Addie et al., 2003, Benetka et al., 2004). The prevalence of type I and II FCoV has been surveyed in many countries, including the USA (Vennema, 1999), UK (Addie et al., 2003), Japan (Hohdatsu et al., 1992, Shiba et al., 2007), Austria (Benetka et al., 2004), and Switzerland (Kummrow et al., 2005). Regardless of which assays were used, the majority of infections were attributed to type I FCoV. Although both type I and II FCoV can cause FIP, their likelihood of association with FIP was controversial in different studies (Kummrow et al., 2005, Hohdatsu et al., 1992).",

Recently, the evolution of CoVs has been extensively studied (Dong et al., 2007, Vijaykrishna et al., 2007, Woo et al., 2007) and the prototype FCoV strain 79-1146 was placed in group 1a together with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and two wild animal CoVs (Vijaykrishna et al., 2007). As strain 79-1146 is a type II virus isolated long time ago (McKeirnan et al., 1981), the genetic information carrying in current FCoVs might be quite different. To explore the relationship between FIP and different FCoV serotypes and to better understand the prevalence and genetic diversity of the recent type I and II viruses, naturally infected cases collected over the past 5 years from our teaching hospital were investigated. Despite the higher prevalence and genetic diversity of type I FCoV, infection with type II FCoV appears to be highly significantly correlated with FIP.",

The temperature cycling (Mastercycler Personal, Eppendorf), consisted of 3 min of preheating at 94 \u00b0C; 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 50 \u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 40 s, with a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 5 min. Multiplex-nested PCR was performed on 2 \u03bcl of the first PCR product using nested primers (Addie et al., 2003).

In comparison to the low nucleotide sequence similarity between type I and II FCoV (56.2\u201363.6%), homology within all analyzed type I viruses (83.3\u201395.2%) and within all type II viruses (91.7\u201399.4%) appeared to be much higher (Fig. 1, Fig. 2\n). The nucleotide divergence between local FCoVs was between 6.2% and 11.7% for five type I viruses (Table 4\n) and between 0.6% and 3.1% for five type II viruses (Table 5\n). These findings revealed that, within the time frame of this study, type I FCoVs displayed more genetic diversity than type II viruses. The phylogenetic trees constructed using the partial S gene sequences are shown in Fig. 3\n. Apart from one local type I virus (NTU2R) and local CCoVs (NTU2 and 9) that originated from the same lineage, other type I viruses displayed divergence.

In concordance with others findings, our results indicate that the majority of FCoV infection in Taiwan is due to type I viruses (88.7%). Our sequence analyses revealed that the type I virus is more genetically diverse than type II virus, a phenomenon that might be due to the large type I-infected population around the world and the possibility of a lengthy persistence of the virus in the asymptomatic cats (Addie et al., 2003, Herrewegh et al., 1997). Cats that are co-infected with both type I and II viruses were detected at a rather high frequency in this study (15.8%, 6 among a total of 38 FIP cases) (Table 1). Similar findings (6.8%, 5/74) were reported in a study that employed RT-PCR to type FCoV using organ pools from cats with FIP in Austria (Benetka et al., 2004). Did both types of viruses participate equally in the pathogenesis of FIP in these co-infected cats? Or one type plays a more significant role than the other?

            "text": "A study conducted in Swiss cats using an IFA assay reported that infection with type I FCoV was more frequently associated with clinical signs and/or FIP (Kummrow et al., 2005). In contrast, using a different assay (RT-PCR), our results revealed that it is type II virus that significantly correlated with FIP (p\n = 0.0046). A previous seroprevalence study conducted by Hohdatsu et al. (1992) in Japan also concluded that FIP due to type II FCoV might be higher than type I viruses. In our study, type II FCoV was detected on the rectal swabs from three healthy cats using RT-PCR. Follow-ups were possible for two of these three cats. None of the rectal swabs collected during the past 3 years for these two cats were positive for FCoV (data not shown). Similar finding was observed from one specific pathogen-free cat experimentally infected with a type II virus (strain Wellcome) (Stoddart et al., 1988). Unlike other seven cats that died from the infection, this cat did not develop clinical signs of FIP and the viral shedding ceased at day 14 post-infection. Taken together with the observations from the aforementioned studies, infection with type II FCoV seems to follow a different course than infection with type I virus. Type I virus was demonstrated to be able to persist in cats living in multi-cat households for more than 6 years (Addie et al., 2003) and for at least 7 months in a single experimentally infected cat (Herrewegh et al., 1997). To our knowledge none of the similar finding has been reported in the naturally occurring type II FCoV infection. Type II virus is more likely to cause acute infections that result in either FIP or recovery without persistence. This distinction might explain why, in the epidemiological studies from various countries, the prevalence of type II virus is consistently lower than that of type I virus (Addie et al., 2003, Benetka et al., 2004, Hohdatsu et al., 1992, Kummrow et al., 2005, Shiba et al., 2007, Vennema, 1999).",

Since type II FCoV originated from a double recombination between type I FCoV and type II CCoV (Herrewegh et al., 1998, Pratelli et al., 2003), it was believed that the S gene of type II FCoV would be more closely related to type II CCoV. When the wild animal CoV, type II CCoV, and type II FCoV were aligned (Fig. 2), however, type II FCoVs had higher similarity to a raccoon dog virus strain CoV/GZ43/03 and a Chinese ferret badger CoV strain CoV/DM95/03 (97.6\u201399.4%) than to either reference type II FCoV (93.5\u201397.6%) or type II CCoV (95.2\u201398.8%). This finding indicates that, in addition to CCoV, there are viruses from other families of animals (e.g., Mustelidae) that share a common evolutionary origin in the S gene with type II FCoVs.",
