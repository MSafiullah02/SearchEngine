A subtle difference that is not well-specified may exist between infectious diseases (any disease that can be caused by an infectious agent-e.g., tetanus) and communicable diseases (any infectious disease that can be transmitted directly or indirectly by an infected person). The dynamics of infection may be different from the dynamics of the clinical disease itself. Thus, the incubation period for a clinically visible infectious disease may overlap with the infectious period (period of transmissibility). Moreover, infections may frequently be subclinical but may be transmitted from an infected person. An infectious disease is the result of interactions within a dynamic system consisting of the pathogen, the environment, and the characteristics of the host. Several factors may influence the transmission dynamics related to the pathogen (e.g., antigenic stability, virulence, reservoir), the environment (e.g., occupational setting, climatic conditions) and finally the host (e.g., age, gender, genetic predisposition, immunity, behavior).",

In a formal recommendation (Commission Recommendations 19-09-2003 concerning the European schedule of occupational diseases) the European Commission defined occupational infectious diseases as any infectious or parasitic (sic) disease that can be transmitted to man by animals or remains of animals, as well as other infectious diseases caused by work in disease prevention, healthcare, domiciliary assistance, and other comparable activities for which an infection risk has been proven. These definitions are added in a short list of five agents, including tetanus, tuberculosis, brucellosis, amoebiasis, and viral hepatitis. A classification of communicable occupational diseases can be made according to the pathogen involved-i.e., bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic (see Table 7 .1). Other classification schemes relative to the mode of transmission may be used, such as contact-(direct or indirect, interhuman vs. zoonotic), vector-(mechanical or biological), or vehicle-(air, food, or water) borne. In this regard, the difference between a reservoir (the agent multiplies within the host) and a vector (just carrier of the pathogen) of an infectious agent may be important. Biological terrorism agents may form a specific subcategory themselves. ",

            "text": "The prevalence of communicable diseases affecting the workplace depends on the specific occupation examined. In work presented by the International Labor Organization, it is estimated that between 1.9-2.3 million work-related deaths occurred worldwide in 2000 (data available at www.ilo.org/safework). In the same work, the lower limit of work-related diseases was 1.6 million and approximately 320,000 (20%) were attributed to communicable diseases (data available at www.ilo.org/safework). The epidemiology appears to differ per country and depends on gross domestic product (GDP) per sector. The type of profession is also very important. The healthcare professions are characteristically associated with an occupational risk from blood-borne pathogens that has led to the implementation of specific protection measures (Beekmann & Henderson 2005; Brunetti et al. 2006; Puro et al. 2005; Sadoh, Fawole, Sadoh, Oladimeji & Sotiloye 2006) . A large study from the Netherlands examining data from a region with a half-million people (and two major hospitals) discovered an incidence of exposure to blood-borne pathogens of 1.2 cases per day-both in the hospital and the community setting (van Wijk et al. 2006) . Athough the incidents were split between the hospital and the community setting, they were related to occupational activities 95 percent of the time and, more specifically, healthcare activities in 84 percent of the cases (van Wijk et al. 2006) . High-risk incidents predominantly involved hospital personnel (van Wijk et al. 2006 ). In another large study from the United Kingdom, known hepatitis C virus or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmissions to health care workers was reported to be at the rate of 1.43 per year. In the same study, HIV and hepatitis C transmissions were occurring at an approximate rate of 0.009 per 1,000 hospital beds per year. The risk of infection when exposure involved sources with no risk factors was significantly lower (less than one in one million for HIV transmission). More work is necessary to correctly identify prevalence and incidence of specific disease entities according to profession, and recent studies have shown unexpected observations (Olsen, Axelsson-Olsson, Thelin & Weiland 2006) . In particular, health care workers have an increased risk from occupational infectious diseases that may occasionally lead to death. The annual death rate for occupational events, including communicable diseases has been calculated around 17-57 deaths per 1 million workers, however more accurate estimations are necessary (Sepkowitz & Eisenberg 2005) .",

The corresponding figures for the also tick-borne Anaplasma phagocytophilum were 17 percent vs. 5 percent, respectively (Cisak et al. 2005) . A high proportion of asymptomatic cases was noted in the same study.

Climate and climatic changes, for example, may play an important role in the geographical distribution of pathogens. For example, colder than usual temperatures were blamed for the recent H5N1 avian influenza epidemic in Turkey (Giesecke 2006) . Other infections whose epidemiology is especially affected by climatic changes are those that are vector-borne (e.g., malaria, dengue, leishmaniasis), and tick-borne diseases (Kovats, Campbell-Lendrum, McMichael, Woodward & Cox 2001; Lindgren & Gustafson 2001; Lindgren, Talleklint & Polfeldt 2000; Lindsay & Birley 1996) . This is not due to effects of the climate on the microorganism itself, but rather to the vectors of the microorganism. Disease incidence for tick-borne encephalitis significantly increased in a Northern European country, and was highly related to factors such as consecutive mild winters and higher temperatures that favored tick activity (Lindgren & Gustafson 2001) . Climatic changes may have more pronounced effects in vulnerable populations that are protected by low-quality health services (Lindsay & Birley 1996; Lindsay & Martens 1998) .

Of great importance in controlling communicable diseases in the working environment are institutional guidelines and standard operating procedures regarding exposure to certain pathogens. Such guidelines have been established, especially for the health care environment, and especially with regard to blood-borne pathogens and agents of biological terrorism. Competent occupational physicians, together with other available specially trained personnel (e.g., infectious disease specialists or infection control nurses for the healthcare environments), implement guidelines and intervention measures when required. Although harmonization of procedures at a global level has not been established yet, guidelines for specific exposures from organizations with an established expertise-e.g., Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or other similar organizations and committees (Puro et al. 2005 )-are universally accepted and incorporated into infection control manuals in hospitals and other institutions around the globe.",

Recent research shows that compliance may be influenced by risk perception of the worker (Ganczak et al. 2006; van Gemert-Pijnen et al. 2006) . Primary prevention is of paramount importance in instances of vulnerable populations where low rates of use of such measures have been reported (Yang et al. 2005 ); however, one should not underscore the importance of education and training in such populations. In a cohort study of 600 female bar workers, a simple intervention consisting of regular screening for sexually transmitted infections, together with syndromic management and relevant information and counseling was offered-it was not only well-received, but also resulted in significant reductions in the prevalence of gonorrhea, HIV, and other sexually transmitted infections (Riedner et al. 2006 ).",

It affected workers in processing and distribution centers of the United States postal service who handled envelopes contaminated with anthrax spores (Greene et al. 2002; Holtz et al. 2003; Jernigan et al. 2001) . The most commonly seen occupationally acquired form of anthrax is the cutaneous form that occurs through direct skin exposure of people working with sick animals (Oncu & Sakarya 2003) . It presents with the characteristic black eschar. This form of the disease was observed in wool-sorters in the past (Carter 2004) , and occupations at risk include agricultural workers, herdsmen, and those handling sick animals or their products-e.g., hair, meat, bone and bone products, and wool (Oncu & Sakarya 2003; Smego, Gebrian & Desmangels 1998) . In nonendemic areas, imported goat hair, hides (Need author names here, not article name 2006) and wool may be implicated in human cases. If left untreated, all forms may lead to sepsis and death. Treatment consists of supportive care and appropriate antimicrobials that can also be used for prophylaxis over an extended duration (Bossi et al. 2004a) . Vaccines focusing on the protective antigen of the microorganism are available and are used especially in military vaccination programs (Grabenstein, Pittman, Greenwood & Engler 2006) . A lot of research in newer vaccines is ongoing (Baillie 2006; Scorpio, Blank, Day & Chabot 2006 ).",

The microorganisms are shed by the genital material of infected animals (e.g., placental tissue) and may exist in the environment for months (Parker et al. 2006 ). Professionals at risk include veterinarians (Abe et al. 2001) , meat processing plant workers, sheep and dairy workers, cattle and livestock handlers (Sadecky 1981) , and staff working in research laboratories using sheep (Simor et al. 1984) . Zoo workers also may be at risk (Ohguchi et al. 2006) . In a recent epidemiological study, two high-risk village areas for positive Q fever serology were identified (Psaroulaki et al. 2006 ). Use of manure in the garden, ownership of animals (especially goats), and the presence of tick-infested or aborting animals were identified as important risk factors for Q fever seropositivity (Psaroulaki et al. 2006) . Outbreaks in slaughter houses have been described (Carrieri et al. 2002; Gilroy et al. 2001 ). An effective whole-cell vaccine is licensed in Australia (Parker et al. 2006 ).",

            "text": "Tuberculosis is caused by the microorganism Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is one of the most frequent infectious diseases worldwide, and its transmission is airborne. The disease can be extremely contagious. During an occupational outbreak, a single patient working in a shipyard (with an eight-month delay in diagnosis) was the source of a huge outbreak in a small town in Maine (Allos et al. 1996) . Those at highest risk were the ones working closest to the infected person (Allos et al. 1996) . Unfortunately, tuberculosis infections may not be recognized early (de Vries, Sebek & Lambregts-van Weezenbeek 2006) . The infection usually involves the lung parenchyma, but can also present in extra-pulmonary forms such as lymphadenopathy, bone and joint infections, and serious meningoencephalitis. Occupations at risk include health care workers and correctional workers. Nurses are among the professions at highest risk (Tzeng 2005) . Rates of latent infection in health care workers may be extremely high, especially in endemic areas with poor quality of protection (Kayanja, Debanne, King & Whalen 2005) . Transmission, however, has been found to be strongly associated with health care work, even in settings with low incidence of tuberculosis (Diel, Seidler, Nienhaus, Rusch-Gerdes & Niemann 2005) . From 2510 reported cases of tuberculosis during a 10-year study in San Fransisco (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) , 31 (1.2%) occurred in healthcare workers (Ong et al. 2006 ). Work-related transmission was documented in about one in three of these healthcare workers, but rates of such acquisition gradually decreased over the study period (Ong et al. 2006) . Delayed diagnosis of tuberculosis (especially if the index case is an older patient) may be one of the main causes of transmission from patient to health care worker (de Vries et al. 2006) . Although several outbreaks have been described in prisons (Bergmire-Sweat et al. 1996; Drobniewski 1995; Jones, Craig, Valway, Woodley & Schaffner 1999; Laniado-Laborin 2001; McLaughlin et al. 2003; Ruddy et al. 2004; Skolnick 1992; ), a recent study identified mainly demographic (rather than occupational) factors associated with the disease in correctional health care workers (Mitchell et al. 2005) . Nevertheless, continued vigilance to control occupational exposure is warranted (Mitchell et al. 2005) .",

Thus, professions with such exposure (and especially healthcare workers) comprise the main risk groups. Hepatitis B has been associated with a higher risk for transmission to health care workers in comparison with HIV or Hepatitis C. The risk of transmission relates to the degree of contact, the Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status of the source patient, and the serological conversion, which is estimated around 30 percent (Werner & Grady 1982) . The risk appears to be higher during the first five years of employment (Snydman et al. 1984) . Prevaccination with HBV vaccine, and the application of universal precautions in dealing with blood or other potentially infectious material, is paramount in preventive efforts against HBV. Recommendations for postexposure measures have been published, and HBV vaccine (if unvaccinated or with low serological titers), Hepatitis B immunoglobulin, or both, must be started as soon as possible (within 1-7 days) (Puro et al. 2005 Hepatitis C Hepatitis C is also acquired through exposure to blood or other potentially infectious material. Health care workers are again the primary risk group for exposure. The risk of transmission after a percutaneous exposure is in between that of Hepatitis B and HIV, and estimated around 1.8 percent (Range: 0%-7%)(Updated U.S. Public Health Service Guidelines for the Management of Occupational Exposures to HBV, HCV, and HIV and Recommendations for Postexposure Prophylaxis 2001). The risk depends on the type of procedure and the prevalence of the disease in the general population. For emergent thoracotomy and a prevalence in the population of 17 percent, a probability of 0.0027 for chronic Hepatitis C seroconversion has been calculated (Sikka et al. 2004) . Following exposure, close follow-up and treatment of acute seroconversion is indicated because there is no immediate prophylactic action (Puro et al. 2005 ",

Professions with increased risk for exposure include veterinarians, cullers and poultry workers, farmers or those exposed to commercial poultry, people involved in litter management and carcass disposal in affected areas, zoo and nature reserve workers, gamekeepers, biologists, laboratory technicians, and health workers caring for possible human cases. Poultry workers, especially those involved in activities such as butchering and contact with ill birds in the affected areas, seem to carry the highest risk (Bridges et al. 2002) . The role of occupational exposure for health care workers has not been well established. Serological data from the 1997 Hong Kong epidemic indicate that subclinical H5N1 infections may occur (Swayne 2006) , however others have failed to prove such an association during the recent phases of the outbreak in Southeast Asia (Apisarnthanarak et al. 2005) . Person-to-person transmission is probable and requires close and extensive contact (Ungchusak et al. 2005) . The disease has milder forms that present with influenza-like illnesses and/or symptoms from other systems (e.g., conjunctivitis) (Swayne 2006) and severe forms associated with respiratory distress and death (Beigel et al. 2005; de Jong et al. 2005; Shu, Yu & Li 2006; Tran et al. 2004; Yu et al. 2006) . Occupational medicine has its own role and can significantly contribute in reducing the risk of transmission of avian flu to workers at risk via prevention and prophylactic measures (Halpin 2005; Stone 2006; Whitley & Monto 2006) . Such efforts are of paramount importance because humanity is prepar-ing to face a pandemic caused by a novel influenza strain and the first target group with the highest risk is poultry workers (Stone 2006; Swayne 2006; Whitley & Monto 2006) .",

Exposure in closed spaces to active infestations of infected rodents seems to be the most important factor for infection (Mills et al. 2002) . This probably explains the observations of no serological evidence of infection in workers widely exposed to rodents (Fritz et al. 2002) . The virus was first recognized in the United States during 1993 (Duchin et al. 1994) . Farmers appear to be at an increased risk through exposure to rodents or their excreta (Mills et al. 2002; Vapalahti, Paunio, Brummer-Korvenkontio, Vaheri & Vapalahti 1999) , and farm and timber workers were most frequently affected in an epidemic in Chile (Castillo, Naranjo, Sepulveda, Ossa & Levy 2001) . People occupied in hand plowing or planting (Mills et al. 2002) , harvesting field crops (Mills et al. 2002) , or involved in cleaning or other activities of rodent-infested buildings (e.g., barns, vacant dwellings) (Mills et al. 2002) are considered at risk.

At-risk occupations include farmers and migrant farm workers, construction and excavation workers, as well as workers in archeological sites (Coccidioidomycosis in Workers at an Archeologic Site 2001; Werner, Pappagianis, Heindl & Mickel 1972) because the organism is found in the soil in endemic areas (Schmelzer & Tabershaw 1968) . Physicians should keep this entity in the differential diagnosis in people who developed a respiratory infection after traveling to affected endemic areas (Desai et al. 2001 ).",

Tinea corporis and tinea inguinalis were also observed (Sahin et al. 2005) .

Nevertheless, dermatophytoses have a worldwide prevalence and have been described in association with other occupations, including healthcare workers-such as those working in nursing homes (Smith et al. 2002 )-or professional ice hockey players (Mohrenschlager, Seidl, Schnopp, Ring & Abeck 2001) .",

To ensure consistency, collaboration with a more central authority such as the local public health authority may be preferable when assessing these indicators.

According to the working environment and relevant infections, similar guidelines should be established for other professions.
