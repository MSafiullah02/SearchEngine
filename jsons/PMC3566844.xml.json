Septated vacuoles fuse to become a single\nspherical vacuole during adaptation from glucose to methanol. Atg8 is necessary for vacuolar\nfusion during adaptation of P. pastoris cells to methanol. Although vacuole fusion\nrequires the processing of an inhibitory C-terminal peptide of Atg8 by Atg4, it does not\nrequire the lipidation of Atg8 to phosphatidylethanolamine on membranes. Neither Atg7, nor\nthe Gly 116 residue of Atg8 involved in conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine, are\nnecessary for this process. Atg8 localizes to vacuolar membranes and its previously\ndescribed tethering and fusion activities are necessary for vacuole fusion [23]. Vacuole fusion has been studied in vivo and\nrecapitulated in vitro from yeast. It requires multiple SNAREs, but Atg8 was not\nidentified in this analysis [24]. It is therefore\nprobable that Atg8 localized at the vacuolar membrane recruits SNAREs and/or other fusion\ncomponents through its ability to interact with AIMs on many yeast proteins [11], rather than serving as the direct fusogen [25].",

When p62 protein levels increase in cells as a\nconsequence of a block in autophagy, other cellular pathways are dysregulated. In\nparticular, p62 sequesters keap1, an E3 ligase for the transcriptional activator Nrf2. Keap1\nitself is downregulated by autophagy. Thus, as p62 levels increase, free keap1 might\ndecrease, allowing Nrf2 levels to increase, perhaps indirectly having an impact on BLOC1 and\nAP3 mRNA and protein expression [43].",

The first is the conventional\nsecretion pathway for proteins that are synthesized at the endoplasmic reticulum and contain\na signal for translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum, followed by their vesicular\ntransport to the Golgi membranes and subsequent export from the cell. Examples of molecules\nthat follow this pathway include insulin, neurotransmitters, hormones, mucins and collagens.\nThe second pathway is the unconventional secretion process of proteins synthesized in the\ncytoplasm that lack a signal for entry into the endoplasmic reticulum\u2013Golgi membrane\npathway. Examples of proteins that use this pathway include insulin-degrading enzyme,\nacyl-CoA-binding protein (Acb1), fibroblast growth factor 2, interleukin 1-\u03b2\n(IL-1\u03b2) and many galectins. The mechanism of unconventional protein secretion remains\npoorly understood, but there is good evidence that Acb1, and probably IL-1\u03b2, are\nsecreted by an autophagosome-like vesicular intermediate, requiring many but not all\nproteins of the normal degradative autophagic pathway [44,45,46,47,48]. Unlike autophagy, this\nvesicular intermediate captures cytosolic cargo and delivers it to the exterior of the cell,\nbypassing the normal process of autophagosome and lysosome fusion [49]. Data from studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests that\nthis process begins at a new compartment for unconventional protein secretion (CUPS) that\ncontains the proteins Grh1, Vps23, Atg8 and Atg9, as well as\nphosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate [50]. The mechanism\nof formation of the CUPS and secretory autophagosome-like vesicles from this compartment are\nunknown. Several autophagy proteins that produce degradative autophagosomes are probably\ninvolved in the formation of secretory autophagosomes, but how these vesicles avoid fusion\nwith the lysosome and vacuole is not understood. Intriguingly, this unconventional secretory\npathway might be used by many pathogens to evade destruction in the lysosomes and instead\nused for their release from the cells. New evidence suggests that caspases, particularly\ncaspase 3, the death regulator caspase, regulate unconventional protein secretion. A\nsignificant proportion of the caspase-dependent secretome of nutrient-starved human\napoptotic endothelial cells comprises proteins lacking conventional secretion signals,\nsuggesting an association between caspase activation and unconventional secretion pathways\n[51].",

These new roles point to a complex interplay between\nautophagy, cell proliferation and cell death during neural development in mammals\n[70]. Additionally, the knockout of ATG genes in\nmice yields distinct phenotypes ranging from early embryonic to perinatal lethality, or an\nincreased incidence of tumours in adulthood, which are phenomena we do not yet understand,\nbut which also suggest roles for Atg proteins in tumour suppression [71]. The emerging themes that hold great promise for future exploration\nare the roles played by the autophagy machinery in the reprogramming of signalling, membrane\ntransport, cell cycle arrest and in cell survival, death and differentiation (Sidebar A).",

In yeast, this complex includes Atg1, Atg13 and the\nAtg17\u2013Atg29\u2013Atg31 subcomplex. The mammalian Atg1 complex has the yeast Atg1\nhomologue, Unc-51-like kinases 1 or 2 (ULK1 or ULK2, respectively), the\nautophagy-related 13 homologue (ATG13), a molecule functionally similar to yeast Atg17,\nFIP200 (focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-family-interacting protein of 200 kDa) and Atg101\n[72]. Nucleation is the step that recruits\nproteins and lipids for autophagosome biogenesis. It begins with the recruitment of Atg\nproteins, such as ATG14L and WD-repeat proteins interacting with phosphoinositides\n(WIPIs), to the PAS\u2014a step requiring the activity of the class 3, PI3K complex, as\nwell as phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. Membrane expansion and closure\u2014during\nautophagosome formation, an isolation membrane expands from the PAS, either by direct\nflow of membranes from a source such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or by vesicle\nfusion. The isolation membrane surrounds the cargo, and fusion of the growing edge of\nthe isolation membrane completes autophagosome formation. The two UBL-conjugation\nsystems (Atg8/LC3 and Atg12) are involved in vesicle expansion and closure, and SNAREs\nare also probably involved. After autophagosome formation, several Atg proteins are\nrecycled in a process involving Atg9. Autophagosome and lysosome fusion\u2014the\nautophagosome fuses with the lysosome (the vacuole in yeast) to form an autolysosome, in\nwhich the cytosolic cargos are degraded and recycled. This process also involves SNAREs.\nPAS, phagophore assembly site; SNARE, soluble NSF-attachment protein receptor; UBL,\nubiquitin-like.",
