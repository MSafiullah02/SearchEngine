The etiology is partially explained by the physiologic increase in oxygen consumption by almost 20% (caused by fetal and uterine demands). However, the body compensates by increasing tidal volume and to a lesser extent respiratory rate [1, 2]. These changes make the partial pressure of oxygen slightly higher than normal on a blood gas, and would range from 100 to 110 mmHg. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide would be lower than normal for a non-pregnant patient and ranges from 27 to 32 mmHg [3]. Low pulmonary reserves that arise from reductions in functional residual capacity (caused by the gravid uterus and changes in the chest wall morphology) [1] and increased oxygen consumption make pregnant women develop hypoxemia more rapidly during apnea [4].",

Initial management involves lowering the blood pressure urgently especially in patients who have severe elevation of blood pressure that persists longer than 15 minutes. Once pulmonary edema occurs, parenteral therapy is more effective, and nitroglycerin is the agent of choice as recommended by The European Society of Cardiology [8]. Diuretics should be instituted to promote preload reduction recognizing that the pre-eclamptic patient may have complex fluid balance needs due to low oncotic pressure. If necessary, noninvasive ventilation is recommended in patients with increased work of breathing or hypoxemia as it is known to improve these parameters and it may decrease the need for invasive mechanical ventilation [9].",

Certain factors easily obtained by a good history can help the clinician understand who is at increased risk of complications from asthma, such as history of exacerbations, intubations, and recent steroid use. Most exacerbations are characterized by cough, wheezing, and dyspnea. The National Asthma Education and Prevention (NAEP) group recommends obtaining a baseline peak expiratory flow in order to guide further management. A target oxygen saturation should be above 90% with consideration for invasive mechanical ventilation in those who are in impending respiratory failure. A partial pressure of carbon dioxide within the normal range of 36\u201340 on an arterial blood gas can be an early sign of imminent respiratory failure in the gravid patient. Pharmacotherapy with inhaled beta agonists, inhaled anticholinergics and steroids are identical to that in the non-pregnant patient. Care should be taken during mechanical ventilation to avoid a short expiratory time that can cause auto peep [18]. Intravenous magnesium sulfate may be beneficial in acute severe asthma in addition to bronchodilators especially in patients with coexistent hypertension or preterm uterine contractions [18, 19].",

If the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is strongly considered, treatment with unfractionated heparin should be started immediately unless high risk or a contraindication is present for the use of anticoagulants. Unfractionated heparin and low-molecular weight heparin are safe to use during pregnancy because they do not cross the placenta.

Respiratory muscle rest involves institution of invasive or noninvasive mechanical support, and the ventilator must overcome pressures related to airway resistance and elastic properties of the lung to allow adequate ventilation and gas exchange. A trial of non-invasive ventilation can be instituted early on in patients with pulmonary edema. Favorable out- comes have been reported in case reports and series [36]. For patients who require intubation and mechanical ventilation, low tidal ventilation strategy is recommended [37]. Positive end expiratory pressure improves oxygenation and should be used to provide a PaO2 > 65 mmHg while administering the least FiO2. The target PaCO2 is 30\u201332 mmHg since this is the normal level during pregnancy. Marked respiratory alkalosis should be avoided because it may decrease uterine blood flow. Maternal permissive hypercapnia may also be deleterious to the fetus because of resultant fetal respiratory acidosis although this mode of ventilation has been used safely in pregnant women in small trials. Propofol infusion is the sedative drug of choice. If paralytics are indicated, cisatracurium is the preferred agent [38].",

This can be achieved by the use of appropriately sized bolsters at chest and hip level to help elevate the patient above the mattress. This also allows for anterior displacement of uterus off of the inferior vena cava, which is necessary for adequate venous return after 20 weeks gestation.
