EV71 belongs to Enterovirus genus, Picornaviridae family. EV71 is a non-enveloped virus with a single-strand, positive-sense RNA genome. Currently, there are no specific drugs for EV71 infection. Five inactivated whole virus vaccines are currently being developed and showed good safety and immunogenicity in clinical trials (Li et al., 2014). One of the five vaccines has been approved by the China FDA recently (Sinovac Obtains New Drug, 2016). In addition, a formalin-inactivated EV71 vaccine, in a Phase I clinical trial, showed strong cross neutralizing ability against EV71 B1, B4, B5 and C4A subgenotypes but not C4B, C2 and coxsackievirus A16 (Chou et al., 2013). Another EV71 subgenotype C4 vaccine also showed cross neutralizing ability against B4, B5, C2 and C5 subgenotypes (Zhu et al., 2013). The subgenotype restriction of these vaccines compromises their vaccination efficacy and limits their application in the clinics.",

Upon binding to the receptor, type I IFNs induce hundreds of downstream genes, known as IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), and confers an antiviral state of host cells (van Boxel-Dezaire et al., 2006). The specific roles of most of these ISGs in host antiviral response are still largely unknown. Among these ISGs, PKR and p53 promote the apoptosis of virus-infected cells (Balachandran et al, 2000, Takaoka et al, 2003). 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthases (OAS) are activated by IFN during viral infection and produce 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates which activate RNase L and further lead to the degradation of viral RNA (Stark et al., 1998).",

To maintain elevated serum IFN without requiring repeated injections, an adenovirus vectored interferon-\u03b1, named as DEF201, was generated (Wu et al., 2007). Interferon is species specific, so mouse interferon-\u03b1 gene was constructed into adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector under the control of a strong promoter PCMV. Upon intranasal administration, the adenovirus vector transduces the IFN-\u03b1 gene into nasal epithelial cells where IFN-\u03b1 is expressed constitutively. In vivo studies showed that DEF201 could significantly increase the half-life of IFN-\u03b1 and was protective for mice against viruses or bacteria infection including western equine encephalitis virus (Wu et al., 2007), vaccinia virus (Smee et al., 2011), arenavirus (Gowen et al., 2011), rift valley fever virus (Scharton et al., 2015), SARS coronavirus (Kumaki et al., 2011), yellow fever virus (Julander et al., 2011), chikungunya virus (Dagley et al., 2014) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Damjanovic et al., 2014).",

These mIFN concentrations increased in a DEF201 multiplicity of infection (M.O.I.) -dependent manner. Minimal mIFN expression (10 pg/mL) was detected upon treatment with Ad5 vector control. The expression of mIFN stimulated by DEF201 was further evaluated in vivo (Fig. 1b). Upon intranasal treatment of DEF201 at dose of 5 \u00d7 107 PFU per mouse, abundant mIFN (300\u20139000 pg/mL) was detected in mice serum on 1, 3 and 5 day post-infection treatment. mIFN concentrations in the serum of Ad5 vector-treated mice were within the range of 10\u2013100 pg/mL which was used as baseline in this study. On 7 day post-infection treatment, the mIFN concentrations in the serum of DEF201-treated mice decreased to 70\u2013500 pg/mL. These results showed that DEF201 could drive robust expression of mIFN both in vitro and in vivo and the in vivo expression of mIFN stimulated by DEF201 could last for at least 7 days.",

Massive cells infiltration was also observed, suggesting that EV71 infection caused severe inflammation in hind limb muscle tissue. As reported, during EV71 infection, immune cells, mainly neutrophils and macrophages, were recruited to the EV71 infection sites and released abundant pro-inflammatory cytokines which further led to tissue damage (Wang et al., 2003).

            "text": "IFN is mainly involved in innate immune system by directly inhibiting the replication of viruses. However, previous studies reported that IFN also played a role in acquired immune system. IFN could enhance antibody production by enhancing B cell development and differentiation (Neubauer et al., 1985, Jego et al, 2003). IFN also promoted immunoglobulin class switching from IgM to IgG and enhanced the specificity of antibodies (Finkelman et al., 1991). Long term antibody production and immune memory were also induced by IFN (Le et al., 2001). Thus, DEF201 might be able to enhance the neutralizing ability of anti-EV71 antibodies in mice serum during EV71 infection. To evaluate this, 5\u2013day-old BALB/c suckling mice were intranasally dosed with DEF201 (5 \u00d7 107 PFU per mouse) at 24 h prior to challenge. Ad5 empty vector was as control. DEF201-treated mice were vaccinated by UV-inactivated non-replicating EV71 (2 \u00d7 107 PFU per mouse) via i.p. injection, mice serum was collected at different time points post-vaccination and the neutralizing ability of mice serum was evaluated by neutralization assay. As shown in Fig. 8\na\u2013c, in comparison with Ad5 vector control, serum of mice given DEF201 showed 20%\u201330% higher neutralizing ability against EV71 at day 4 (8a), 8 (8b) and 12 (8c) post-injection of UV-inactivated EV71. Statistical studies showed that the percentage of EV71 which was not neutralized by mice serum was significantly lower upon DEF201 treatment, in comparison to Ad5 control (Fig. 8d). The result supported that DEF201 could enhance the production of specific anti-EV71 neutralizing antibodies in vivo.",

In the murine model, 106 PFU DEF201 offered full protection for mice against lethal EV71 infection. For therapeutic application, DEF201 can only offer protection for mice at early stage of EV71 infection (less than 12 h), indicating that DEF201 has limited effects at late stage of mouse EV71 infection when symptoms have already developed. Clinically, the latency of EV71 infection is several days and the limited antiviral effects of DEF201 suggesting that the application of DEF201 in the treatment of EV71 infection is restricted. However, one important point was that, in this murine model, a lethal dose of EV71 virus was used which quickly established a significant infection in mice tissues and led to death of the mice while clinically, EV71 infection is usually a self-limiting disease with mild symptoms featuring hand, foot and mouth symptoms. Thus, there is still a chance that DEF201 might be effective to treat EV71 infected patients developed symptoms as the diseases progression is less severe. To evaluate the clinical therapeutic efficacy of DEF201 against EV71 infection, further studies are necessary.",

Post-infection treatment of DEF201 at 6 h post WEEV infection was also protective. Similar inhibition pattern by DEF201 was also observed for vaccinia virus (Smee et al., 2011), arenavirus (Gowen et al., 2011), SARS coronavirus (Kumaki et al., 2011), yellow fever virus (Julander et al., 2011) and chikungunya virus (Dagley et al., 2014).

In our study, we showed that IFN produced by 5 \u00d7 107 PFU DEF201 was maintained at high levels for at least 7 days in mice serum. This demonstrates that the effective half-life of IFN has been significantly prolonged by DEF201 which is continually releasing the IFN into the bloodstream. To further illustrate whether DEF201 has long term antiviral effects, we tested the antiviral effects of 48 h pre-infection treatment of DEF201 in our EV71 murine model. Due to the age limit of suckling mice model, we were only able to show that DEF201 pre-infection treatment is effective for at least 48 h against EV71 infection. However, previous studies have shown that the antiviral effects of DEF201 could last for at least 13 weeks for WEEV and 56 days for vaccinia virus. This might be due to three reasons: firstly, antiviral state of host cells can last for long term upon IFN stimulation, secondly, the IFN is continually produced by the transduced cells, and thirdly, the immune system stimulated by DEF201 offers long term antiviral protection. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that DEF201 is able to offer long term antiviral protection in vivo.",

Although we did not observe any side effect in suckling mice, the difference between animal models and clinical application should be considered. Thus, further clinical evaluation of DEF201-related side effects is necessary, especially for children since they are more vulnerable for HFMD. In addition, the use of adenovirus 5 vector might stimulate immune response against the vector which might lead to inflammation at the inoculation sites of DEF201 especially for those people who have pre-existing immune response to adenovirus 5, though the inoculation via intranasal administration has minimized the exposure of adenovirus 5 vector to immune system. Thus, further DEF201-related immune response should be evaluated in clinical trials. One approach to avoid immune response to DEF201 for people with pre-existing immune response to adenovirus 5 is to change another delivery vector for DEF201.",
