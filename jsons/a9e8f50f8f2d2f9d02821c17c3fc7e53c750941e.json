In recent years a plethora of data from clinical studies and mouse disease models have demonstrated that excessive inflammasome activation promotes several diseases. In that regard, emphysema a major debilitating components of COPD, has shown a link between IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 and disease. Despite these observations, a causal role for specific inflammasomes in emphysema is unknown.

Furthermore, genetic blockade of Aim2 in gp130 F/F mice prevents the development of emphysema by suppressing augmented ATIIC apoptosis.

Airway and/or lung remodeling are major features of IPF and associated with accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Fbln1), an important ECM protein has four variations (Fbln1a/b/ c/d) and stabilizes other ECM proteins. Fbln1c, one of Fbln1 variants, predominates in both humans and mice, and involves in lung fibrosis.Aims:To determine Fbln1c levels in IPF patients and elucidate the role Fbln1c in pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis.Methods: Fbln1c was measured in IPF patients and bleomycininduced lung fibrosis model. Fbln1c deficiency (\u2212/\u2212) mice were used to investigate the mechanism of Fbln1c regulated remodelling in lung fibrosis.Results: Fbln1 was increased in lung tissue of IPF patients and Fbln1c protein was increased bleomycin-induced experimental lung fibrosis in mice. Fbln1c \u2212/\u2212 mice had reduced airway remodelling and lung fibrosis, and were protected against lung function impairment after 28 days bleomycin challenge. In experimental lung fibrosis, Fbln1c interacted with fibronectin, periostin and tenascin-c to stabilise collagen deposition around the small airway and in whole lungs. Fbln1c regulated transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) activation by binding with latent TGF-\u03b2 binding protein (LTBP1), and mediated phosphorylated Smad3 level, a downstream molecular of TGF-\u03b2 pathway. This process also regulated myofibroblasts number and collagen deposition. Interestingly, Fbln1c \u2212/\u2212 mice also had less inflammatory cells, and interleukin (IL)-33 in lungs of experimental lung fibrosis than WT mice.Conclusions:Our data demonstrates a novel role of Fbln1c in lung remodelling in IPF.

The primary aim of this study was to explore whether having asthma leads to lower PA levels, and/ or whether lower PA levels leads to more asthma in children and adolescents between the ages of 8 and 14 years.Methods: This analysis was conducted in 4983 children who participated in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC) between the ages of 6 and 14. Data on asthma and PA were collected via questionnaires and Time Use Diaries biennially since the children were 4 years old. Bi-directionality of this relationship was investigated using a crosslagged model for PA and asthma implemented using structural equations modelling. Incident-current asthma was defined as doctor's diagnosis since previous wave and either use of asthma medications or current wheeze in the past 12 months. PA was time in minutes spent doing medium to vigorous physical activities in a day. Included confounders were gender, older siblings, socioeconomic z-score and body mass index (BMI).Results: Effect estimates for each regression suggested that there was no association between PA and asthma at any age and in either direction; the adjusted regression coefficients for the effect of asthma on 88, 1.11). Similarly, the adjusted log of OR for the effect of PA on asthma was 0.99 (0.99, 1.00) at each age.Conclusions:These results suggest that PA at any of the observed ages does not prospectively predict incident-current asthma in this longitudinal analysis. Similarly, incident-current asthma does not predict future PA in the observed ages.BLOOD EOSINOPHILS AND SERUM IgE PREDICT RESPONSE TO OMALIZUMAB IN PATIENTS WITH SEVEREALLERGIC ASTHMA: INNOVATE TRIAL POST-HOC ANALYSIS VOLKAN MANGA, MD 1 , MARC HUMBERT, MD, PhD 2 , RATKO DJUKANOVIC 3 , STEVE GREENBERG, MD 4 , THEODORE A.

Biomarker-guided therapy may help to identify subgroups who demonstrate greater clinical benefits from omalizumab than the overall SAA population. Methods: A post-hoc analysis of INNOVATE trial data (Humbert et al. Allergy 2005) was performed to determine the impact of treatment on exacerbation rates and health-related quality-of-life (AQLQ) of SAA patients stratified by peripheral blood eosinophils per mcl (EOS) and serum IgE (IU/ml). Negative binomial regressions were utilized within biomarker strata to estimate response to omalizumab vs placebo, controlling for potential confounders.Results: An exacerbation reduction was observed among omalizumab-treated patients vs placebo in EOS-high strata: EOS\u2265300 (n=245) 38.98%, p=0.0399; EOS\u2265150 (n=316) 39.01%, p=0.0178. Exacerbation reduction increased further upon enriching these strata according to increased IgE (>75 IU/ml): EOS\u2265300/IgE>75 (n=184) 53.88%, p=0.0018; EOS\u2265150/IgE>75 (n=235) 53.75%, p=0.0005.

Results: 303 patients (post BD-FEV 1 : 57 [13] % predicted) were randomised and treated (full analysis set n=274). Change in steps/day at week 12 is shown in the Table; no significant gain in PA was seen by adding T+O or T+O+ExT to SMBM, versus SMBM+P. However, PArelated difficulty and dyspnoea significantly decreased at week 12 for SMBM+T+O versus SMBM+P.

CHANGES IN LUNG FUNCTION AND FORCED OSCILLATORY TECHNIQUE (FOT) PARAMETERS FOLLOWING BRONCHIAL THERMOPLASTY (BT) IN PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY ASTHMA ING AJ 1,4 , LANGTON D 2 , PIERUCCI P 1,2,4 , FARAH CS 1,3,4 Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Macquarie University, Monash University, 3 Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, 4 Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney Introduction/Aim: Bronchial Thermoplasty (BT) improves symptom control and reduces exacerbations in patients with refractory asthma. The precise mechanism remains unclear, but consistent improvement in spirometry has not been recorded. We postulate that assessment of lung function during tidal breathing with oscillometry to measure respiratory impedance may better reflect the clinical improvements reported. Methods: Patients with refractory asthma (GINA Step 5) had the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ5), spirometry, resistance at 5 Hz (R5) and reactance at 5 Hz (X5) recorded before and 6 weeks after completing BT. One centre measured impedance with the forced oscillation technique (FOT) [TremoFlo C-100, Thorasys Medical Systems, Canada] and the other with impulse oscillometry(IOS) [Sensormedics]. Results: The average age was 60.8 (1.4) years in the FOT group and 61.2 (11.4) years in the IOS group. ACQ5 scores improved in both groups. In the FOT group, there were significant improvements in spirometry and X5; and the change in X5 correlated strongly with changes in vital capacity and weakly with ACQ5.Conclusion:The improvement in symptom control following BT may, in part, relate to deflation and consequent improvement in lung mechanics during tidal breathing. Differences in measuring impedance with FOT and IOS techniques will be discussed.Grant Support: University of Sydney Post Graduate ScholarshipTO-132 5 YEAR SINGLE CENTRE EXPERIENCE OF AIRWAY STENTING M.

SHARAN RANDHAWA 1 , RANJAN SHRESTHA 1 Respiratory Department, Fiona Stanley Hospital, WA Introduction: The average risk of developing pneumothorax following TTNB of a lung lesion is about 20%. This can be disabling especially in elderly patients with preexisting respiratory disorders and multiple comorbidities, resullting in hospital admissions either for observation or insertion of chest drain. To date there have been no studies directly correlating any risk factors in predicting poor tolerance to iatrogenic pneumothorax.\u2022 To identify all patients with pneumothorax post TTNB and record the outcomes of their hospital admissions.\u2022 To identify if age, smoking history, preexisting respiratory disease and reduced FEV1 and or DLCO are risk factors for poor tolerance of pneumothorax and increased length of stay in hospital.\u2022 Demographic data of all patients who underwent TTNB (age, gender), primary lung disease, medical histories, smoking status, lung function tests (FEV1, FVC, DLCO, KCO, TLC) and length of hospital stay if complications occurred were retrospectively collected from two centers (Fiona Stanley Hospital and Fremantle Hospital WA) from August 2014 to February 2016.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF51": {"text": "SAFETY AND DIAGNOSTIC YIELD OF TRANSBRONCHIAL LUNG CRYOBIOPSY FOR DIAGNOSIS OF INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASEMICHELLE TAN 1 , KHIN HNIN 2 , DION GROSSER 1 , BRIAN J SMITH 1Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Queen ElizabethHospital, Woodville South, South Australia, 2 Flinders University, Bedford Park, South Australia Introduction: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a heterogeneous group of respiratory conditions requiring clinical, radiological and pathological correlation. Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC), forceps transbronchial biopsy (FTBB), CT guided core biopsy and open lung biopsy are all potential methods for obtaining lung tissue for analysis. The newest of these options is cryobiopsy and the place for this method for diagnosing ILD is yet to be fully determined. Our study aims to analyse and compare diagnostic yield and complications for the two bronchoscopically derived lung biopsy types being TBLC versus FTBB in patients with suspected ILD in the context of our hospital -an academic tertiary care centre.Methods: A retrospective observational study of patients with radiological features suspicious of ILD who have undergone TBLC and FTBB between 1 Jan 2014 and 30 Sept 2016. Results: patients who underwent bronchoscopy, 57 eligible patients (35 females, 61% and 22 males, 39%) with a mean age of 60.1 were identified to have either TBLC (37) or FTBB (20). Grade 1 bleeding occurred in 63% of TBLC and 71% of FTBB while grade 4 bleeding occurred in 2 TBLC cases. Similar proportion of patients in both groups had a pneumothorax (10% vs 10.8%). A better diagnostic yield was achieved with TBLC (51% vs 25%). However, it was not statistically significant with odds ratio 2.1 (95% CI 0.63 to 6.9, p value 0.228). With a mean maximal diameter of 5.4 AE 2.3mm, cryobiopsies were larger than samples obtained from FTBB (2.3 AE 1.7mm, p value <0.001). Conclusion: TBLC appears to be as safe as FTBB with the advantage of larger biopsy size although diagnostic yield of TBLC was not statistically different to FTBB in this single cohort. Larger, prospective studies are needed to establish the role of TBLC in the diagnostic algorithm of ILD. The Authors.

Talc pleurodesis and indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) are approved treatments with similar quality-of-life benefits in randomised studies to date, resulting in equipoise. Freedom from hospitalization and further interventions are important goals of management. The Australasian Malignant Pleural Effusion randomised trial aimed to determine whether IPCs are more effective than talc pleurodesis in reducing total hospitalization days in the remaining lifespan of MPE patients. Methods: Open-labelled, randomized controlled trial recruited 146 participants with symptomatic MPE from nine centers in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and Hong Kong and followed them for 12 months/until death. Participants were randomized (1:1) to IPC or talc pleurodesis, minimized by region (Australasia vs Asia), malignancy (mesothelioma vs others), and trapped lung (vs not). Primary endpoint was total number of days spent in hospital from trial intervention to death, or 12 months. Secondary outcomes included further pleural interventions, patient-reported breathlessness scores, quality-of-life measures, and adverse events. Results: The IPC group spent significantly fewer days in hospital than the Pleurodesis group: median (IQR) 10.0 (14) vs 12.0 (14) days, p=0.026, which represented 6.2 (13.8)% vs 11.1 (33.7)% of their remaining lifespan, respectively, p=0.01. Mean reduction in hospitalization days was 3.6 days per patient: 12.7 (IPC) vs 16.3 (Pleurodesis) days. Fewer IPC-treated patients required further invasive pleural drainages (4.1% vs 22.5%, 95% CI 7.7-29.2%). Improvement in breathlessness and qualityof-life, and adverse event rates were comparable. Conclusion: IPC management reduces the time MPE patients spend in hospital before death and minimizes the need for further invasive pleural interventions, while providing equivalent symptomatic improvement, when compared with conventional talc pleurodesis.

Craniofacial dimensions of the upper airway favouring obstruction have been described in the Chinese population suggesting that this group has an OSA phenotype less dependent on obesity. While OSA is now also recognized to be caused by a hypersensitive ventilatory control system (high loop gain [LG]) and a low arousal threshold (ArTh), no study has examined how ethnicity may influence these traits. We aimed to examine whether LG and ArTh differ between Chinese and Caucasian individuals with OSA. Methods: Chinese (n=45) and Caucasian (n=45) subjects with moderate-to-severe OSA matched by age, gender and apnoeahypopnoea index (AHI) were studied. We measured LG (including the chemoreflex delay, Delay, and cycling period, Tn) and the ArTh by fitting a validated control system model to the pattern of ventilation during spontaneous OSA from clinical polysomnography. Data presented are Median (IQR) unless indicated otherwise. Results: Despite matched AHIs, Chinese subjects had a lower BMI compared to Caucasian subjects (27.2[4.5] vs. 34.0[9.45]kg/m 2 , p<0.001), and longer respiratory event durations (Mean[SEM].

GLANVILLE 1 Lung Transplant Unit, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia, 3 Woolcock Institute, Sydney, Australia, 4 Concord Clinical School, University of Sydney, Australia. Introduction: The pulmonary component of the human respiratory virome (a subset of the human microbiome) is transplanted into the recipient at the time of lung transplantation (LTX). We explored the dynamics of virome transplantation and the role of intercurrent community acquired respiratory viruses (CARV). Methods: A single centre, prospective, longitudinal study with measures of viral load in recipient nasopharyngeal swabs prior to LTX, swabs of explanted lungs, donor lungs prior to implantation and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on post-operative days 1, 7, 21, 42, 63, 84. Samples were processed to isolate nucleic acids, followed by RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qPCR for CARV (Human Rhinovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Influenza A and B, Parainfluenza Virus 1, 2, 3, and Human Metapneumovirus).Results: 18 consecutive LTX subjects (bilateral: heart lung = 17:1) (age 49 AE 13 years, mean AESD) (M: F= 9:9) were recruited. Follow up was 51AE36 days, range 2-108 days. The most frequent CARV was Influenza A, followed by influenza B. In 4 individuals, influenza A virus was detected on the swab of the explanted lung at a low viral load, and in 3 of these, Influenza A was also detected in the day 1 BAL at an increased viral load. Multiple patients had Influenza A detected in consecutive BAL from post-operative days 1, 7 and 21, while Influenza B and Parainfluenza 1/2 were detected from day 21. Indication for transplant was not a determinate of viral detection.Conclusion: Viral load increases in subjects at the time of LTX, likely associated with immunosuppression. CARV appear to be part of the transplant respiratory virome as analysed by BAL, showing progressive expansion of select populations following LTX. The long-term outcomes associated with the ongoing presence of CARV may be elucidated following this longitudinal study.

BairoPite Clinic (BPC) in Dili manages more than a fifth of all TB cases in the country. Improved understanding of TB epidemiology in Timor-Leste will inform quality improvement activities focused on recognition, accurate diagnosis and prevention of TB in children. We aimed to describe the epidemiology and diagnostic features of notified paediatric TB cases at BPC and to compare this to national paediatric TB notification rates.Methods: Prospective collection of demographic, clinical and laboratory data for all patients diagnosed with TB at BPC between January 2014 and December 2014 inclusive. Comparison is made with national notification data with respect to paediatric notification rates.Results:In total, 4090 TB cases were notified. Of these, 426 (10%) were children aged <15y. BPC notified 886 cases, of which 110 (12%) were aged <15y. Contact with a known TB case was reported in 43/110 (39%) BPC cases; 15 (14%) were identified through screening household contacts of infectious index cases. Evidence of BCG vaccination was documented in 36/110 (33%). Malnutrition was identified in 39/110 (35%); HIV in 2/110 (2%). Pulmonary TB was diagnosed in 78/110 (71%) BPC cases and 318/426 (75%) paediatric cases nationally. Bacteriological confirmation occurred in 5/78 (6%) pulmonary cases at BPC and 36/318 (11%) cases nationally. In districts other than Dili and Baucau, 29/131 (22%) paediatric pulmonary TB cases were sputum smear positive.Conclusion:Paediatric TB is common in high TB burden settings such as Timor-Leste but is under-recognised. Malnutrition is an important risk factor; HIV co-infection is rare. Opportunities for prevention include improved BCG coverage and implementation of household contact tracing. Consideration should be given to improved specimen collection and strategic use of PCR to improve diagnostic certainty.

Indications, stent selection, peri-procedure and stent-related complications, survival and impact of stent on symptoms were reviewed.Results: 37 stents (14 silicon; 20 self-expanding metallic, 3 Dynamic Y) were inserted in 32 patients. Stent numbers increased over the first 4 years then stabilised. The case-mix consisted of emergent malignant airway obstruction and outpatients with both benign and malignant pathology. 20 patients were from the Local Health District and 12 were referred from other Health Districts. 11 patients had stents inserted for nonmalignant indications. In these patients, post-operative complications included mucous retention, stent migration, obstructing granulation tissue and mucosal flap tissue. Repeat bronchoscopies to address these complications averaged 4 procedures per patient (range 1-12). 21 patients had stents inserted for malignant indications primarily for palliative indications. 17 patients were able to be either transferred back to their referral centre to complete further therapy or were discharged from their acute hospital admission.
