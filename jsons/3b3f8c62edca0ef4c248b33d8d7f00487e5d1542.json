Children rarely have severe clinical illness but the infection attack rate in a household study was similar for children and adults [23] . The Korean government made a decision on school closure on 23rd February 2020, when there were signs of community spread [24] . The Korean response also included extensive testing and the outbreak in and up to the 28th March 2020, 387,925 tests were performed, 9,478 cases were identified of which 144 died. The epidemic curve in Korea is shown in Figure [ 24] .

Detailed information is not available on gender, age, clinical stage and prognosis of the identified cases. The start of the epidemic shows great similarity with the rapidly rising trend observed at the early stages in Italy and Spain. Although the health authorities and the government in Turkey were quick to take action by cancelling schools and social, cultural, sports activities and scientific meetings, a nationwide lockdown was not put into practice. A rough estimation of the number of ill people and the number of deaths for Istanbul (20 million inhabitants) according to different scenarios from different countries and provinces (Table 1) shows that the consequences of an epidemic similar to that in Italy would be devastating.",
