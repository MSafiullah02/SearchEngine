Those studies found that VL on day 3 of admission was associated with worse disease severity as defined by a clinical score [26] , PICU admission, or respiratory failure [10] , which differs from our findings. In those 2 studies, however, the duration of hospitalization was longer, from 6 to 7 days (compared with 2.3 days in our study), steroid use during hospitalization was not mentioned, and analyses were not adjusted for duration of symptoms, suggesting that the study population and inpatient management strategies differ between institutions. A recent study evaluated sequential VL and cytokine concentrations and mucosal gene expression profiling in 30 infants hospitalized with RSV LRTI. The study showed that intubated infants had lower VL and reduced interferon and CCL5/RANTES concentrations than children with moderate disease [27] .
