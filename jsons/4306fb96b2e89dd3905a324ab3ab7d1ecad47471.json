ORF1, the 5 proximal ORF of HEV, encodes nonstructural proteins involved in RNA replication which share homology with the products of the corresponding ORF of members of the alphavirus-like superfamily of plus-strand RNA viruses. Among animal virus members of this superfamily (the alphavirus and rubivirus genera of the family Togaviridae), the product of this ORF is a nonstructural polyprotein (NSP) that is cleaved by a papain-like cysteine protease (PCP) within the NSP. To determine if the NSP of HEV is similarly processed, ORF1 was introduced into a plasmid vector which allowed for expression both in vitro using a coupled transcription/translation system and in vivo using a vaccinia virus-driven transient expression system. A recombinant vaccinia virus expressing ORF1 was also constructed. Both in vitro and in vivo expression under standard conditions yielded only the full-length 185 kDa polyprotein. Addition of co-factors in vitro, such as divalent cations and microsomes which have been shown to activate other viral proteases, failed to change this expression pattern. However, in vivo following extended incubations (24-36 hours), two potential processing products of 107 kDa and 78 kDa were observed. N-and C-terminus-specific immunoprecipitation and deletion mutagenesis were used to determine that the order of these products within the NSP is NH 2 -78 kDa-107 kDa-COOH. However, site-specific *",

Additionally, sequence alignment across HEV strains revealed that the other member of the proposed catalytic dyad of this PCP, His 590 , was not conserved. Thus, the cleavage of the NSP observed following prolonged in vivo expression was not mediated by this protease and it is doubtful that a functional PCP exists within the NSP. Attempts to detect NSP expression and processing in HEV-infected primary monkey hepatocytes were not successful and therefore this proteolytic cleavage could not be authenticated. Overall, the results of this study indicate that either the HEV NSP is not processed or that it is cleaved at one site by a virally-encoded protease novel among alpha-like superfamily viruses or a cellular protease.",

Most of these motifs are found in the corresponding ORFs of alphavirus-like superfamily members and all of them are found in the corresponding ORFs of RUB and BNYVV (these ORFs are gener-ally termed nonstructural protein ORFs or NSP-ORFs). The presence of an MT motif suggests that the HEV RNAs are capped. The PCP is characteristic of the alphaviruses, RUB and BNYVV, and PCPs are found in members of other plus strand RNA virus families, however, the amino acid alignment between the putative HEV protease and these other viral PCPs was weak [16] . While the function of the conserved X domain is unknown, it flanks a PCP domain in the polyproteins of several plus strand RNA viruses.",

In this construct, pMAL/ORF1, the HEV ORF1 was inserted in frame downstream from the malE gene of E. coli. As shown in Fig. 1 , the pMAL/ORF1 C-terminal construct (pMAL/ORF1C) construct was generated by digesting pMAL/ORF1 with BamHI and religating. This construct contained nt 2959 to 5108 of the HEV genome which, when expressed, was expected to produce a 122 kDa (43 + 79 kDa) MBP fusion protein containing the last 716 aa of the NSP. The pMAL/ORF1 N-terminal construct (pMAL/ORF1N) was generated by digesting pMAL/ORF1 with NruI and PmlI (both blunt end restriction enzymes) and religating in the presence of the blunt end linker with sequence CTAGCTAGCTAG to introduce a stop codon (TAG) in all three reading frames and an NheI restriction site for verification. This construct contained nt 28 to 2429 of the HEV genome which, when expressed, was expected to produce a 131 kDa (43 + 88 kDa) MBP fusion protein containing the first 800 aa of the NSP. pTM1HEV and vvHEV pTM1, a mammalian expression vector derived from a pUC plasmid and designed for gene expression under the control of the T7 promoter vector, was kindly provided by by B. Moss [23] . In this vector, the T7 transcripts begin with the EMCV IRES element for efficient, cap independent initiation of translation. A 5651 bp fragment of the HEV genome from pBSORF1 containing nt 28 to 5679 that included the entire HEV ORF1 (nt 28 to 5109) was introduced into pTM1 using the NcoI site at nt 28 of the HEV genome to align the authentic AUG start of HEV with the AUG used by the IRES. The pTM1 vector also contains the vaccinia virus TK gene flanking sequences for uptake of the expressed gene into vaccinia virus by homologous recombination and selection for TK-mutants. Such a recombinant, vvHEV, was generated using pTM1HEV and the vvWT Western Reserve strain by standard methodology [20] .",

            "text": "In vivo expression of the HEV ORF1 was initially accomplished using vvHEV; similar results were obtained by transfecting with pTM1HEV and this construct was used for site-specific mutagenesis. As shown in Fig. 3A , following standard radiolabeling periods (< 5 h) done three hours post-infection, only the 185 kDa product was observed. This result was reproduced in four cell lines, Chang Liver, HeLa, Vero and HepG2. However, when labeling times were extended to 24 h initiated at 18 h post-transfection, in addition to the 185 kDa product, a 107 kDa product immunoprecipitated by both the N-and C-terminal specific antisera and a 78 kDa product immunoprecipitated only by the N-terminal specific antiserum were also observed. Because of the extended radiolabeling periods, the gels contained a number of additional bands also present in the control vvWT lanes. These results were reproduced in Chang Liver, HeLa, Vero and HepG2 cells. Subsequent experiments showed that when radiolabeling was done at 18 h post-transfection these processing products were detectable, although very faint, following radiolabeling periods as short as 3-5 h (data not shown). However, to ensure that the processing would be detectable, subsequent experiments were done using the prolonged radiolabeling periods. Immunoprecipitation with the N-and C-terminal specific antisera indicated that the 78 kDa product was N-terminal within the NSP and the 107 kDa product was C-terminal [because each serum recognized roughly half of the NSP (see Fig. 1B ), the N-terminal specific antiserum would be expected to immunoprecipitate both products]. This was confirmed when the pTM1-HEV/N-FLAG and C-FLAG constructs were expressed. As shown in Fig. 4A , the anti-FLAG Mab immunoprecipiated the 78 kDa N-FLAG product and the 107 kDa C-FLAG product. Two deletion mutations and a site-specific mutation were also made using pTM1HEV, as diagrammed in Fig. 1. pTM1HEV Bam contained nt 28 to 2959 of the HEV ORF1 and the 108 kDa protein expressed from this construct contains the first 978 aa of the HEV NSP while pTM1HEV S/H lacked 2079 to 2439 of the HEV ORF1 and the 172 kDa protein expressed from this construct lacks aa 684 to 804 of the HEV NSP. The sizes of the proteins produced from these constructs was confirmed by in vitro expression to be as expected (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4B , pTM1HEV BamHI (lanes 3-4), which deleted the C-terminus of the NSP, produced the deleted full-length 108 kDa product and also produced the 78 kDa processing product, confirming the previous finding that this product originates from the N-terminus of the NSP. This result also localizes a putative virus-specific protease domain to within the first 800 amino acids of the NSP. In contrast, pTM1HEV S/H (lanes 5-6) produced its deleted full-length 172 kDa product, but no apparent processing products, indicating that the deletion contains either the cleavage site or a putative protease. The site-directed mutation, pTM1HEV/CtoG, changed C 483 to G. As this was a member of the predicted catalytic dyad, this mutation should abrogate cleavage if the prediction was accurate. However, expression of the pTM1HEV/CtoG construct resulted in production of the full-length 185 kDa product and both the 107 and 78 kDa processing products (Fig. 4C) , identical to the expression of pTM1HEV, indicating that this Cys 483 is not a catalytic residue.",

Two independent HEV Burmese strain constructs were employed in these studies. One construct, pBSORF1, which was used to gener-ate pTM1HEV and vvHEV, was constructed with clones used in determination of the originally reported Burmese strain sequence [32] . The second construct, 625DNA, had six amino acid changes out of a total of 1693 aa in the NSP in comparison to the original Burmese strain sequence. Of these, T1077G (a T at aa 1077 in place of G in the originally reported sequence), C1088W, A1132P, A1254V, and R1315G were in the helicase region while L1543F was in the replicase region; none of these were near the predicted PCP. Interestingly, complete sequencing of the ORF1 sequence in pTM1HEV also revealed the presence of C1088W, A1132P, R1315G, and L1543F, indicating that these residues may be the authentic Burmese strain sequence.

Employment of conditions in vitro shown to activate other viral proteases, namely the presence of divalent cations [19, 31] and microsomoal membranes [34] , were without effect. When in vivo expression was allowed to proceed for extended times, two ORF1-specific products of 78 and 107 kDa were detected. Since the size of these products added to the size of the NSP and these products came from the N-and C-termini of the NSP, respectively, their presence was consistent with proteolysis at a single site within the NSP. However, the PCP predicted in ORF1 was not involved in production of these products since mutagenesis of the predicted Cys 483 catalytic site had no effect on the cleavage. Considering that the other predicted catalytic residue, His 590 , is not conserved across HEV strains, it seems doubtful that this PCP exists. Although predictions derived from computer alignments have often been accurate, there are other examples of when such predictions of proteases did not turn out to be correct [28] . Additionally, it is to be pointed out that in the prediction of the ORF1-PCP, it was noted that the alignment used to predict this PCP was weak [16] . The lack of a PCP within the HEV NSP is novel within the alphavirus-like superfamily in that the other animal virus members (RUB and the alphaviruses) utilize PCPs to catalyze cleavage of their NSP.",

Therefore, if one exists, an ORF1-specific protease would have to be of a novel type and its identification and localization would require extensive site-directed mutagenesis (the deletion analysis done in this study localized the putative protease to the amino-terminal half of the NSP). It is also possible that the cleavage of the NSP observed following prolonged in vivo expression was mediated by an enzyme expressed by the vaccinia virus vector or by a ubiquitous cellular enzyme (cleavage was observed in four different cell lines). The former has not previously been encountered during vaccinia virus expression of other viral NSPs which are processed by their own enzymes, but could be checked by expressing ORF1 with a different system. The latter is consistent with the lack of processing in vitro, but has not been described in the processing of other viral NSPs; it could also be an artifact of prolonged expression. Dependence of NSP cleavage on a cellular enzyme would effect both the host range and tissue tropism of HEV. However, we were unable to authenticate this cleavage in HEV-infected primary hepatocytes.

Consistent with this placement, the pTM1HEV S/H deletion mutant which lacked residues 684 to 804 failed to exhibit cleavage. If this cleavage is authentic, the HEV MT and Y domains would be localized on the 78 kDa product and the proline hinge, X, helicase, and replicase domains on the 107 kDa product. The presence of the helicase and replicase domains on the same protein would be similar to RUB with which HEV is phylogenetically most closely related and unique to these two viruses among animal viruses of the alpha-like superfamily.",

However, cleavage was observed following prolonged in vivo expression but it could not be authenticated because we were unable to detect ORF1-specific products in HEV-infected primary monkey hepatocytes, one of only two reported cell culture systems for HEV. Therefore, the HEV NSP may not be cleaved at all, but if the cleavage following prolonged expression is authentic, it is putatively mediated by a novel virally-encoded protease or a cellular protease. An efficient culture system for HEV will be the most direct means for resolving these questions and when such becomes available, the reagents and constructs produced during this study should be very useful in this regard.",
