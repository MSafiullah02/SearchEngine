Antibacterials were instituted before exclusion of recognised pathogens. Acute viral infection may produce damage to host cells by cytolysis or immunopathological damage. In the early stage, cytolysis is accompanied by viral amplification, such that antivirals may be important in treatment. In the later stage, when adaptive immune response is mounted, viral clearance can be accompanied by severe inflammatory damage, especially with high viral burden.4 An immunomodulating agent, such as a corticosteroid, could reduce tissue damage. As an antiviral we chose ribavirin for its potency against DNA and RNA viruses, and methylprednisolone to achieve immunomodulation.",

The index case's fatal outcome suggested that late administration of combination treatment was probably ineffective. Patients with heavier bodyweights worsened despite intravenous 30 mg methylprednisolone every 12 h. Correction for bodyweight to 1 mg/kg daily resulted in lowering of fever and radiographic improvement in 1\u20132 days, but in most patients fever worsened again thereafter. We therefore increased the initial methylprednisolone dose to 3 mg/kg daily, but several severe cases continued to worsen and required pulsed methylprednisolone. Finally, since step-down of methylprednisolone dose in 2\u20133 days resulted in rebound of SARS in some patients, each dose level was continued for 5 days.

Patients with suspected or probable SARS and convalescent cases were put into isolation cubicles, each accommodating four to six patients, and visits were not allowed. Air change (central air conditioning) was increased to 10\u201312 changes per h. Two exhaust ventilation fans were installed in each cubicle to achieve negative-pressure airflow. Closed-system suction was used for mechanical ventilators, the tubes of which were fitted with high-efficiency particulate air or similar filters. All health-care workers wore surgical or N-95 masks, protective eye-wear, full-face shields, caps, gowns with full sleeve coverage, surgical gloves, and shoe covers. Advanced barriers, such as the Air-Mate HEPA Powered Air Purifying Respirator System (3M, MN, USA) or T4 Personal Protection System (Stryker Instruments, MI, USA) were stocked in case high-risk procedures, such as endotracheal intubation, were required. Staff washed hands with antiseptic rubs after every contact with patients or contaminated objects and after taking off protective garments. Direct contact of eyes, nose, or mouth with hands before sanitisation was discouraged. Environmental or equipment surfaces were cleaned daily and immediately after use with domestic bleach (1000 ppm hypochlorite solution) for non-metallic items and 70% alcohol for metallic items.",
