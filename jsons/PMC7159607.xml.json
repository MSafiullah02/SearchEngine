In a first step, the endonuclease Dicer processes the long dsRNA into small or short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) which are around 21 nucleotides long, of which 19 nucleotides form a helix and 2 nucleotides on each of the 3\u2032 ends are unpaired (Figure 1 A). The actual effector of the RNAi is the ribonucleoprotein complex RISC (RNA\u2010induced silencing complex), which is guided by the siRNA to the complementary target RNA. As a result, the target RNA is cleaved at a specific site in the center of the duplex, 10 nucleotides from the 5\u2032 end of the siRNA strand.6 The catalytic component that cleaves the target RNA (slicer activity), has been identified as the protein designated Argonaut 2 (Ago2).7 An analysis of its crystal structure showed that Ago2 contains a domain which resembles RNase H,8 a long\u2010known protein that cleaves the RNA component of a DNA/RNA duplex. After cleavage, the target RNA lacks those elements which are typically responsible for stabilizing mRNAs, namely the 5\u2032 end cap and the poly\u2010A tail at the 3\u2032 end, so that the cleaved mRNA is rapidly degraded by RNases and the coded protein can no longer be synthesized.",

Antisense oligonucleotides have been employed for the last 30 years to inhibit the expression of genes at the mRNA level. Antisense and RNAi strategies have many things in common, such as the necessity to identify suitable binding sequences on the target RNA, the stabilization of the oligonucleotide by chemical modification, or the transport of the negatively charged polymer across the cell membrane. Experience in the antisense field allowed for very rapid progress to be made with the new RNAi strategy.19 There are, however, important differences between the two technologies: Antisense oligonucleotides are single\u2010stranded (modified) DNA molecules, which primarily induce the cleavage of the target RNA in the cell nucleus by activation of RNase H. In contrast, RNAi is triggered by double\u2010stranded RNA, which functions primarily in the cytoplasm. Ago2, the most important component of the RISC, is localized in the p bodies.20 As a result, the central steps of RNAi appear to take place in these discrete structures of the cytoplasm. In the case of RNAi, an endogenous cellular pathway is followed, which could explain the high efficiency with which siRNAs are able to inhibit the expression of their target genes. They can be up to 1000 times as efficient as traditional antisense oligonucleotides against the same target molecule.21, 22 While no particularly important region could be determined for the normally 15\u201320 nucleotide long antisense oligonucleotides, the seed region (positions 2\u20138 of the antisense strand, Figure 1 A) is of great importance for siRNAs, since it is presumably here that the interaction with the target RNA begins.",

It became clear in a microarray analysis that siRNAs with common seed regions trigger stronger off\u2010target effects than those for which there are only a few complementary sequences. This means that off\u2010target effects can be reduced by clever design of the siRNA. Furthermore, the specificity of siRNAs can be reduced through the incorporation of modified nucleotides. It is comparatively easy to completely inactivate the sense strand by modifications so that the danger of off\u2010target regulation can be reduced to a minimum. Changes to the antisense strand are, on the other hand, more challenging since the inhibitory effects on the expression of the target gene must not be influenced. A single 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl substitution on the ribose of the second nucleotide was shown to be enough to significantly reduce off\u2010target effects while maintaining silencing activity (Figure 5).98\n",

The RNAi approach was directed against Tenascin\u2010C, which is strongly expressed in this tumor tissue. The RNAi treatment was successful in preventing the re\u2010emergence of operatively removed glioblastomas in many patients. This product is currently being developed further by Senetek PLC. Calando Pharma employed an unmodified siRNA against the M2 subunit of the ribonucleotide reductase in a phase I study for the treatment of solid tumors, whereby the siRNA was delivered by a special nanoparticle. The company Silence Therapeutics is planning a clinical study with an siRNA lipoplex (Atu027). The liposomal formulated 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl\u2010modified siRNA (AtuPLEX) is directed against the expression of protein kinase N3 (PKN3). Other companies have announced clinical trials of RNAi approaches against various forms of cancer for the near future.177\n",

The practical application of RNAi rests on several fundamental patents, the most important of which include patents known as Tuschl I and II as well as Kreutzer\u2010Limmer I. While the Tuschl II patent, which refers to the typical 19\u201321 base pair long siRNAs with 3\u2032 overhangs, has already been granted, the decision regarding the Tuschl I patent remains open. The Kreutzer\u2010Limmer I patent has been granted in Europe (but not yet in the US), however its precise extent is not yet decided.153 A strong patent position is held by the US Biotech Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Besides the named core patents on RNAi, they also hold patents on the chemical modification and delivery of the siRNAs. As a result, Alnylam has made several major deals, for example, an extensive research cooperation with Novartis in 2005. In July 2007, Roche AG received from Alnylam a non\u2010exclusive licence for $331 million for the therapeutic use of siRNAs under Alnylam IP and their European research unit. Much attention was generated by the take over of Sirna Therapeutics by Merck & Co., USA, for $1.1 billion at the end of 2006. These transactions show that the major pharmaceutical companies have recognized the potential of RNAi and are prepared to invest a great deal in this new technology. Further details regarding the patent situation as well as related business in the RNAi field have been brought together in a recent review.153\n",

Around a dozen clinical studies based on RNAi are already running, and the first results are promising. Basically, knockdown technologies can be used against any disease in which a deleterious gene is over\u2010expressed (for example, cancer, viral infections, inflammation). Two major obstacles must, however, be overcome before it can become a broadly applicable standard therapy: The question of their specificity and efficient delivery to the target cells.

These undesired effects can be minimized by the clever selection of the sequence and the use of modified nucleotides.",
