In the wake of COVID 19, a complete lockdown was announced by the Indian government on 24th March 2020. The hospital was closed, except for emergency service. The lockdown suspended the sale of alcohol and tobacco products. Many people with substance use disorder (SUD) could not access care or continue the ongoing treatment like buprenorphine maintenance treatment, anti-craving drugs, and withdrawal management. A recent study has shown that in India, as just about one in 37 people affected by alcohol use disorders and one in 20 affected by drug use disorders have received any treatment, ever (Ambekar et al., 2019) .",

Some of the providers would send minimal information about the case or skipping a few essential patient-related data. The mandatory word count was made to above 100 for elaborate details about the cases. At the same time, we are cognizant of the fact that more than 90 % were using a smartphone to enter the case summary and tried to maintain a balance.

It is asynchronous and combines both consultative and educative components. Hence it can suit a busy work schedule of the specialists (Raney, 2017) . At this point, the telemedicine guideline (Governors, 2020) does not allow a medical practitioner to prescribe narcotic and psychotropic drugs directly to the patient. Hence e-consult, along with existing online mental health services, has the potential to enable costeffective and convenient care for patients in this COVID crisis as well as the future (Liu et al., 2020) .",
