            "text": "Cryptosporidiosis is caused by apicomplexan protozoans of the genus Cryptosporidium and is one of the most common agents causing intestinal infection to both humans and livestock worldwide (Chalmers and Katzer, 2013). The parasite infects the digestive tract of the major vertebrate groups, including humans, livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, horses and poultry), pets (dogs and cats), etc. (Chalmers and Katzer, 2013). In cattle, Cryptosporidium spp. infection was first reported in the early 1970s (Panciera et al., 1971). Of the four species commonly found in cattle (C. parvum, C. bovis, C. ryanae and C. andersoni), only C. parvum is generally associated with clinical disease, especially in neonatal calves (Fayer, 2010; Sunnotel et al., 2006; Thompson, 2008). C. ryanae and C. bovis usually infect older calves and young stock, and C. andersoni mainly adults (Langkj\u00e6r et al., 2007). Experimental infections have been carried out and it has been shown that infected animals shed oocysts with no clinical manifestations of the disease (Thompson, 2008). The importance of C. parvum as an etiological agent of gastroenteritis-like syndrome in dairy calves during their first weeks of life has been confirmed (Sunnotel et al., 2006). The main clinical signs are diarrhea, dehydration, weakness, anorexia, abdominal pain and mortality (Fayer, 2010).",

The SRID kit contains four reference standards (IgG concentration: 400, 800, 1.600 and 3.200 mg/dl) and 5 plates (12 wells per plate) with mono-specific antisera in buffered agarose. Colostrum samples were transported and further processed at room temperature and fat was removed through centrifugation. An amount of 3 \u03bcl of each reference standard was placed into the first wells and the same amount of colostrum sample in the remaining wells, by using a 3 \u03bcl precision pipette. The plates were covered and left right-side up at room temperature for 24 h. At 24 h, the diameter of each ring was read by direct measure on the plate and a standard curve was established. The diameters of the reference standards versus their concentrations were plotted on the graph paper provided in the kit.

It contains high concentrations of nutrients, hormones, cytokines, antibodies and a variety of maternal leukocytes that appear to support the growth and maturation of the calf. The neonate calves have a great ability to absorb immunoglobulins and growth factors from the gut (e.g. IgA, IgM, IgG, IGF-1, lactoferrin, and lysozyme) (Costa et al., 2017). Quality of colostrums is always a crucial factor which ensures that there is sufficient amount of antibodies for absorption by the calves.",

These findings suggest that newborn calves are partially protected by colostral antibodies during their first day of life. Similar results have been published by Wang et al. (2003). Our results highlight the importance of colostrum management in prevention of neonatal diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium spp. in calves and are in line with results from previous studies. Preventive colostrum management leads to protection of calves against cryptosporidiosis through passive immunity (Arsenopoulos et al., 2017; Furman-Fratczak et al., 2011). Moreover, a linear relationship between IgG absorption efficiency and IgG density in colostrum has been demonstrated (Stott and Fellah, 1983).",
