This causes deposition of a substantial amount of milk into the rumen (Breukink et al., 1988) . During the retention of this milk in the rumen, fermentation takes place and volatile fatty acids and lactate are produced. A distinct reduction in pH is also noticed (van Weeren-Keverling Buisman et al., 1990) . At necropsy of chronic RD calves, hyperkeratosis of the rumen is found (van Bruinessen-Kapsenberg et al., 1982; Breukink et al., 1988) . Chronic RD calves usually have a reduced growth rate and are small for their age (van Bruinessen-Kapsenberg et al., 1982) , apparently the result of disturbed energy and protein balance (Breukink et al., 1988) . The latter may be partially due to inappetence but may also be affected by jejunal villus atrophy (de Visser and Breukink, 19&Q, Breukink et al., 1988; van Weeren-Keverling Buisman et al., 1988a) and brush border enzyme deficiency (de Visser and Breukink, 1984) .",

In the induction period, from week 7 onwards, the milk replacer was administered intraruminally in increasing proportions until the faeces became clay-like. In week 11, 50% of the ration was infused into the rumen twice daily, the remaining portion being fed from an open bucket. In the recovery period the entire milk replacer diet was again consumed from an open bucket. In calves H and S the induction period was five weeks. In calf E, the induction period was prolonged by two weeks, during which time the percentage of intraruminally administered milk replacer was raised to 63%. Consequently, the recovery period in this calf started two weeks later. During all three periods, milk replacer from the same batch of powder was fed.",

            "text": "The clinical signs of RD in this calf model were less obvious than in RD patients. The typical clay-like faeces were only observed for a short period in the three experimental calves. This may be the consequence of more rapid clearance of rumen contents in this calf model than in chronic RD patients (van Weeren-Keverling Buisman et al., 1990) . When considering the detection of pathogenic micro-organisms in the faeces, two periods of excretion can be distinguished. The first period (weeks 5-7) was directly post-operative, when pathogenic micro-organisms were found in 7 out of 9 samples of the faeces, but only one calf (S) was diarrhoeic in week 7. This may be attributed to increased susceptibility in the surgically stressed animals, post-operative antibiotic treatment, or both. Ampicillin, for instance, is known to reduce colonization resistance maintained by the normal gut flora (van der Waay, 1979), as a result of which pathogenic micro-organisms may start to colonize the intestine. The second period of shedding of micro-organisms was from weeks 12-15, during the recovery period; Pseudomonas aentginosa, rotavirus and coronavirus were isolated. Calf S suffered from slight diarrhoea during the larger part of the recovery period; Pseudomonas was present in 2 of the 5 faeces samples. This is similar to observations in naturally occurring RD calves, in which a period of diarrhoea is observed after initiation of reconditioning therapy. In more than half of these cases, Pseudomonas were found in the faeces (van Weeren-Keverling Buisman et al., 1988a) . Pseudomonas usually shows a multiresistant pattern towards antibiotics (Batra and Garg, 1987) . Pseudomonas ueruginosu is able to cause a haemorrhagic gastroenteritis in calves (Nilsson and Thiirne, 1%2) but clinically healthy intestinal carriers have also been reported in dairy calves and cows (Matthews and Fitzsimmons, 1% Hoadley and McCoy, 1968; Batra and Garg, 1987) . The incidence of Pseudomonas intestinal carriage in veal calves is probably even higher, due to frequent antibiotic treatment or to the subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics which are frequently added to the milk replacer (Hamstra and van Haeringen, 1977) . No information is available about the pathological changes in the intestine in cases of subclinical Pseudomonas infection.",

Coronavirus was detected only in the recovery period, in calf E in week 14 and in calf H in week 15. Rotavirus and coronavirus can both cause diarrhoea and villus atrophy in the jejunum of young calves under three weeks of age (Torres Medina et al., 1985) . However, in this experiment no pathogenic micro-organisms were shed during the period of intraruminal milk administration, while the vilhrs length was decreasing gradually. Thus, the observed vihus atrophy during the induction period is probably caused by another (non-infectious) factor, resulting from the intraruminal administration of the milk. The transitory decline in villus length shortly after the operations may be associated with the well-known relationship between surgery, stress and the shedding of pathogens.",

Its function is the hydrolysis of lactose into glucose and galactose, which are absorbed in the small intestine (Coombe and Smith, 1973) . Normally, lactase activity is highest in very young calves (Huber et al., l%l) and decreases with age. Toofanian et al. (1974) observed a gradual decrease in activity during the first four weeks of life; after that the lactase activity remained constant in calves up to 6 months old. Lactase activity is also influenced by the type of diet offered: continuation of a liquid lactose-containing diet and prevention of the functional development of the rumen prevented the normal post-weaning decline in lactase activity (Toofanian et aZ., 1974) . Supplementation of milk diets with extra lactose resulted in an even higher lactase activity (Huber et al., 1964) . The lactase activity in our study was therefore probably not only influenced by the observed villus atrophy but was also partly the result of a reduced amount of substrate. In the rumen, an unknown amount of lactose is converted into lactate and volatile fatty acids (van Weeren-Keverling Buisman et al., 1990) .",

Restoration of the depressed activity of this enzyme after the induction period was somewhat delayed when compared with the lactase activity. At the end of the recovery period, in week 16, the AP activities of the experimental calves had almost completely regained their initial values. This suggests that AP activity may also be influenced by villus atrophy.",

It is mainly localized in the duodenum and proximal and mid jejunum (Landsverk, 1980) , where it is involved in energyconsuming sugar and lipid absorption (Stighnair-Herb ef aZ., 1986). It is not known if diet or age influence AP activity. However, in diarrhoeic calves up to 4 days of age with experimental Escherichia coli and rotavirus infections, AP activity is reduced (Stighnair-Herb et al., 1986) . This reduction was also found in K&week-old calves with parasitic gastroenteritis (Benz and Ernst, 1986) . In dogs with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, caused by aerobic flora such as enterococci and Escherichiu coli, AP activity was reduced, while lactase activity and the activities of other brush border enzymes were not altered significantly. This suggests that bacterial secretions or metabolites also specifically act on AP activity (Batt and Hall, 1989) .",
