To conserve oxygen, the best arrangement for a patient not requiring 100% oxygen would be to attach an open\u2010ended reservoir limb to the inlet of a bellows, piston, or self\u2010inflating bag, and augment the 21% oxygen being drawn through it as air enriched with a low flow of oxygen (typically 1 l.min\u22121). In this respect, the design concept was similar to that of the \u2018Triservice\u2019 anaesthesia apparatus, which has been used for many years by the British military with good effect [9]. We recognised that at times, some patients would require a high F\nI\no\n2 and so a facility to provide additional oxygen was provided.",

The pneumatic logic components were selected to have the lowest possible internal volumes to reduce oxygen consumption, as these components pressurise and depressurise with each cycle. For the same reason, they were set to operate at the lowest possible gas pressure (2 bar) for which these components are designed. The main force\u2010generating piston is of the smallest practicable diameter, giving a low displaced gas volume, and finally, the pressure of the oxygen delivered to it during the inspiratory cycle is variable: sufficient to deliver the set tidal volume against the chest wall/lung compliance of the patient but no more. The maximum peak pressure that can be generated is in excess of 60 cmH2\no and so is, in effect, determined in each design by the maximum opening pressure of the safety pressure relief valve.",

Despite this, we felt it was worthwhile to investigate this design modification in our study, if only to enable the delivery of new, as yet undiscovered, therapies in the future. We also demonstrate that by delivering NO in a volumetric manner mechanically linked to the inspired tidal volume and therefore minute volume, a predictable F\nINO can be delivered without the use of expensive electronic control systems, analysers or exhaustable NO electrochemical cells.",

They could be readily manufactured in bulk at low cost, or even as disposable single\u2010use items to prevent cross\u2010infection. These ventilators would be ideally suited for use wherever resources are limited (e.g. developing countries, remote locations, military usage), and for the management of mass casualties and victims of a respiratory pandemic.",

The position of the small magnetised piston adjacent to the magnetic valve (A) has opened this valve causing the pressure in the line (P) to be vented to ambient. As no gas pressure is being applied to the base of the shuttle the spring has pushed the shuttle downwards. Oxygen enters via the inspiratory needle valve (I) and is directed to the base of the small piston, pushing it and the large piston to which it is attached upwards. This closes the unidirectional valve (V) causing oxygen enriched air to inflate the lungs via non\u2010return valve (N). Waste oxygen from the pneumatic mechanism is directed to the reservoir limb at (R). Right: valve (B) is permanently supplied with oxygen at 4 bar. At end\u2010inspiration the magnetic small piston triggers valve (B) which, via the unidirectional valve (U), pressurises the line (P) to 4 bar, causing the shuttle valve to change state. Oxygen at 4 bar now enters via the expiratory needle valve (E) pushing the small piston downwards, causing the large piston to draw oxygen enriched air from the reservoir limb (R) through valve (V). Meanwhile, the patient exhales by passive recoil of the lungs through the respiratory non\u2010return valve (N) to atmosphere. Waste oxygen from all parts of the mechanism is directed to the reservoir limb (R) to enrich the air within.",
