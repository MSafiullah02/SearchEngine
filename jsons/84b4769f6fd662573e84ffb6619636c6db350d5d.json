The viral nucleocapsid is surrounded by a lipoprotein membrane containing glycoproteins and carrying projections (peplomers) which form the so-called corona. Due to its lipidcontaining envelope FIPV is relatively unstable and susceptible to the action of current disinfectants (1 7). It appears, however, that the virus is relatively resistant to drying. This can be concluded from an unintended experiment in which a group of specified pathogen-free cats were infected by an FIPV-contaminated litter pan (27) . C L I N I C A L P I C T U R E FIP appears in two different forms: the wet or exudative form which is characterized by peritonitis and/or pleuritis accompanied by ascites and/or pleural effusions and the dry or parenchymatous form which is characterized by granulomatous inflammation of different organs and no or little exudate (28, 29) . Both forms can occur together. Once clinical symptoms are seen FIP usually takes a fatal course. The diseased animals show elevated body temperatures exceeding 39\u00b0C which may prevail for several weeks. The animals do not eat well and lose weight. The wet form of FIP is easily recognized by the typical exudate in the body cavities. Pleural effusions lead to dispnoea which is sometimes the only symptom the owner recognizes. Quite often the patients do not appear to be unwell irrespective of the presence of ascites. In the wet form, disturbances of the central nervous system (CNS) are encountered in about 10 per cent and ocular symptoms in about 4 per cent of the cases (see below). The dry form is often difficult to diagnose. In emaciated animals the pyrogranulomatous lesions may be palpable in the kidneys and mesenteric lymph nodes. The inflammatory nodules in the spleen, liver, pancreas and omentum are chance findings upon laparotomy. Inflammation of the pleura, lungs and heart recognized in most cases by auscultation and X-ray. Massive involvement of the liver may lead to bilirubinaemia and jaundice. About the most important signs of the dry form are the CNS disturbances and ocular symptoms. Central nervous symptoms are recorded in about 40 per cent of the cases (6) and appear as nystagmus, torticollis, wavering gait, paralysis of the fore and/or hind legs, paralysis of the N . trigeminus and facialis, convulsions and a changed behaviour (6, 31, 32). With an incidence of about 35 per cent ocular symptoms are reported-they may be the only clinical symptoms in about 20 per cent of the cases (20). Ocular symptoms in dry FIP are inflammations of the iris and the ciliary body, turbidity of the humor aqueus and corpus vitreum and inflammatory reactions of the retina (3 1,33-35).",

These increased concentrations are due mainly to the immunoglobillins but also to fibrinogen (in about half of the cases exceeding 4 g/l) and the beta-globulins (36). Liver damage leads to augmented transaminase values, sometimes accompanied with increased concentrations of bilirubin. Enhanced urea and kreatinin reflect the renal damage. In the wet form of the disease especially a disseminated intraversal coagulopathy (DIC) may occur. Weiss et al. were able to show experimentally that in the course of DIC the bleeding time, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time are increased. As a consequence of increased consumption these cats show low platelet counts and high concentrations of fibrin katabolites (37). The mechanisms leading to DIC are not known in detail; important factors seem to be the formation of immune complexes followed by comp!ement activation and a lacking capacity of the liver to secrete coagulation factors (3 8).",

The titre values are often useful for the diagnosis of FIP: about 80 per cent of the cats where the disease had been diagnosed by (histo)pathology possess titres of >400 whereas less than 20 per cent show titres of <loo. In sick cats where no signs of FIP have been found histologically, titres of >400 have been detected only in exceptional cases (42).

This explains the symtoms observed during the first phase of the infection. Clinically apparent FIP occurs only when the virus crosses the mucosal barrier. Weiss & Scott were able to demonstrate viraemia where the virus does not float free in the plasma but stays associated with blood monocytes (44). Crossing of the mucosal barrier and appearance of FIP symptoms are dependent upon the infectious dose (2 1). Under field conditions additional factors must be responsible for virus spread in the feline organism. Differences in the biological properties, e.g. the protein structure of the virus envelope are likely to occur by mutation which would lead to viral subtypes of different virulence. There can be no doubt that differences in virulence exist: in addition to FECV which causes only diarrhoea (16) FIP strains with different biological properties have been isolated (25).",

In the course of FIP increasing concentrations of circulating immune complexes were recorded paralleled by an initial rise and a dramatic decrease ante-mortem of complement components (46). Therefore, complement activation is attributed an important role in the pathogenesis.

Only rarely the virus succeeds in crossing the mucosal barrier and spreads throughout the feline organism via infected monocytes and macrophages. Since the macrophage is one of the cell types where various complement components are synthesized (49) this may lead to increased synthesis and/or release of complement. Simultaneously, activated macrophages also produce interleukin 1 which, apart from its stimulating influence on the B and T cell system, is a potent pyrogen and may be responsible for the febrile reaction (50). Viral antigen is expressed on the surface of infected macrophages; this may stimulate specific Band T-cells and lead them to the production of virus-specific antibodies. These antibodies on one hand bind to the viral antigens thereby inducing the formation of circulating immune complexes (Horzinek et al., in press ). On the other hand the antibodies also attach to the surface of the infected macrophages. Both the circulating immune complexes and the antibodies bound to the macrophages activate the complement cascade cuasing release of anaphylatoxin and cytolysis. The macrophages liberate more virus which in turn can infect more macrophages or be phagocytized as immune complexes. Again more macrophages are infected and the vicious circle is closed.",

On the contrary, immunization led to earlier and more pronounced disease symptoms upon challenge infection (40, 52, 54). For the time being only hygienic measures and the avoidance of stress can be recommended. In a single cat household where an animal has died from FIP the floors, carpets, etc. should be cleaned and disinfected. A new animal should not be introduced into the premises earlier than 2 weeks after disinfection. The situation is different in multicat households. Here the question arises which of the other animals are infected and may shed virus. Unfortunately it is not yet possible to identify these virus carriers. Serology is of no help since most of the cats kept in larger groups are seropositive (42). A stress-free environment (avoidance of crowding) seems to be one of the most important prophylactic measures. When introducing a new animal into a seronegative cattery this cat should be tested for FIPV antibodies. If the test results in a positive titre, the animal should be kept in quarantine for 2-3 weeks. If the animal is seronegative, the risk of introducing a viral carrier is small and quarantine is considered unnecessary. As with other viral infections, catteries and animal hospitals pose a special problem. In these establishments hygienic measures are crucial, e.g. regular disinfections of floors, tables, etc., hand disinfection before handling a cat, regular cleaning and disinfection of food bowls, litter pans etc.; since the cat is a territorial and solitary predator, crowding is to be avoided at all cost.",

An experimental therapy can be considered in selected FIP patients which are not emaciated, show no neurological symptoms and eat normally. We have been able to induce remissions which sometimes lasted for several months using the protocol presented in Table 1 . Also cytostatic drugs in connection with corticosteroids have been recommended ( 5 3). When using corticosteroids and cytostatics virus excretions is probably not affected. Before attempting a therapeutic experiment the risk for other cats should be considered and corresponding measures (quarantine of the patient) should be taken. Other therapeutic possibilities are presently explored. The use of lymphokines should certainly be considered in the future. ",
