Up to date, the virus has been classified into two major genotypes, designated as genotype A and genotype B. Several studies focused on the relatedness between genotypes and disease severity (Skiadopoulos et al., 2004; Agapov et al., 2006) . Although most of the published data suggested that disease severity was not related with a particular genotype (Agapov et al., 2006; Pitoiset et al., 2010) , the extensive investigation on pathogenicity, cross-protective effectiveness and epidemiology for different hMPV genotypes has an important role in the vaccine development. A previous work from China reported that hMPV was detected by RT-LAMP assay (Wang et al., 2012) , however, genotypes A and B could not be differentiated by that assay. Therefore, the genotypespecific RT-LAMP assay targeting the M gene of hMPV described in this study would have a better application prospects. LAMP assay is based on autocycling strand-displacement DNA synthesis performed by Bst DNA polymerase. RNA can be amplified effectively using reverse transcriptase (RTase) together with DNA polymerase. LAMP employs a set of four specifically designed primers (not including two loop primers, which only for time saving) that recognize six distinct sequences of the target. Only when two pairs of specific primers match the target sequences exactly can the gene amplification starts. Therefore, RT-LAMP offers a high level of specificity for reverse transcription and cDNA amplification reactions of RNA viruses under isothermal environments plus the advantages of saving time and reducing experimental error. It is not necessary to open the reaction tubes in the detecting process, which can reduce the risk of contamination. In this study, the detecting limits for both hMPV A and B by genotype-specific RT-LAMP were 10 times greater than conventional RT-PCR. No cross-reaction was shown when templates of hMPV A and B were mixed, indicating that this assay was of highly specificity for detecting and differentiating hMPV A and B. According to the reaction time spent for testing the 63 positive clinical samples (13.5-58.2 min, average 24.8 min), the entire testing process can be completed within 1 h under isothermal conditions at 63 \u2022 C. Therefore, the genotypespecific RT-LAMP assay developed in this study can be used for identifying and genotyping for hMPV efficiently and accurately, especially in those laboratories lack of thermocycling equipments.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 320, "end": 347, "text": "(Skiadopoulos et al., 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 348, "end": 368, "text": "Agapov et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 482, "end": 503, "text": "(Agapov et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 504, "end": 526, "text": "Pitoiset et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 778, "end": 797, "text": "(Wang et al., 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the process of LAMP reaction, pyrophosphate ions as byproduct of reaction bind to magnesium ions and form a white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate. Mori (Mori et al., 2004) designed a real-time monitoring turbidimeter for keeping stable and consistent temperature and measure the turbidities from amplification in multiple tubes from different clinical samples realtimely and simultaneously. Using this apparatus, the efficiency of the reactions can be observed real-timely and the exact reaction peak time can be determined, which is useful and helpful for the developing of a new LAMP assay for a specific target. Additionally, results can be readily observed by the white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate generated during the reaction or by color change by the daylight or UV light via adding FDR in the reaction mixture. Besides thermostatic equipment, no more laboratory equipments are required for the result determination. Therefore, RT-LAMP assay is easy to perform and efficient to determine the positive results. In this study, it was found that the reaction time was extended due to adding FDR, suggesting that the shorter reaction time might lead to a false negative result despite no disagreement in the final qualitative judgment of sample detection. Although the results were consistent when judged by turbidimeter and visual observation with naked eyes under the natural light or under UV Lamp when FDR was added, it could not be ruled out the possibility of false negative determination if the clinical samples contain less RNA copies which are close to the detection limit when judged by naked eyes. Therefore, result judged by turbidimeter or addition fluorescent FDR could be more reliable than by observing precipitate only.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 162, "end": 181, "text": "(Mori et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The coincidence rate for detection of hMPV genotypes A and B from 115 clinical specimens was high by the genotype-specific RT-LAMP, RT-PCR and real-time SYBR PCR.
