The co-ordinated scientific activities among different academic and industrial laboratories resulted in remarkable progress towards understanding the virus and its associated disease and facilitated the flow of vaccine discovery efforts [1], [2], [3], [4]. Besides the standard approach using inactivated whole virus (SARS-CoV) as a vaccine candidate [5], [6], [7] nearly all known delivery systems were employed to develop a SARS candidate vaccine. SARS-CoV antigens (namely S and N) were vectored by DNA, recombinant vaccinia, modified vaccinia ankara (MVA), adenovirus, rhabdoviruses, parainfluenza and baculoviruses [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. In studies employing the surface glycoprotein S antigen, neutralising and protective immunity against SARS-CoV have been shown to be induced.",

Among these vectors is the measles virus (MV) vaccine vector [15], [16]. The MV vector is based on the live attenuated MV vaccine [17] that has a documented safety and efficacy profile. MV is an enveloped RNA virus with a non-segmented genome of negative polarity, belonging to the family of Paramyxoviridae, genus Morbillivirus. The MV vaccine induces long-lived immunity upon one or two low-dose injections [18], [19]. Indeed, persistence of antibodies and CD8+ cells has been shown for as long as 25 years after vaccination [20]. Since the attenuation of MV results from an advantageous combination of numerous mutations, the vaccine is very stable and reversion to pathogenicity has never been observed [19].",

Multiple cloning sites were introduced into the MV genome allowing for the addition of multiple foreign genes and their continuous expression by progeny virus. Several marker genes (GFP and LacZ) and genes from hepatitis B virus (HBV), simian or human immunodeficiency viruses (SIV, HIV), west Nile virus (WNV) and human IL12 were inserted in the MV genome [17], [22], [23], [24], [25]. The corresponding viruses were shown to express these genes and to induce humoral and neutralising antibodies against the homologous viruses [25], [26], [27]. MV targets antigen-presenting cells, and generally interacts with the repertoire of the immune system [28], [29] properties that make the vector an attractive model for recombinant vaccine development. In this study we investigated the use of MV vector as a potential recombinant live vaccine against SARS. Our data show that expression of SARS-CoV-S and -N by rMV induces significant neutralising and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV.",

Each of the recombinant viruses expressed the corresponding S or N proteins as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence using a human convalescent anti-SARS serum (Fig. 1A).

Probed by the same antiserum as above, the S protein was detected in a range of approximately 190 kDa (170\u2013200 kDa) the two major forms of the S protein differ by the extent of glycosylation; based on the nucleotide sequence, the predicted full length of unmodified S protein is 138 kDa and has 23 potential glycosylation sites [5], [12].

To assess the above results, different anti-SARS-CoV S and N antibodies were employed to detect these proteins in lysates of infected cells, a single or mixed infection with both recombinants was performed. Fig. 1C shows that different antibodies specifically reacted with either S or N in lysates of a single recombinant virus infection (rMV-S or rMV-N) or in a mixed infection (rMV-S + rMV-N). Similar patterns of proteins was observed as above concluding that the expressed proteins are those of the SARS-Co virus, especially since lysates of non-infected or empty vector-infected cells did not react with the antibodies.",

It is, thus, useful to screen candidate MV-based vectors before moving forward to non-human primates. Groups of five mice were immunised intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 104\n pfu of either virus followed by a homologous boost 2 months later. Pooled serum samples of naive mice and of mice immunised with MV, rMV-S and rMV-N were tested for MV and SARS specific antibodies by ELISA and neutralisation assays. Whereas only rMV-S induced high titres of SARS-CoV neutralisation antibodies, all viruses induced comparably high titres of anti-MV IgGs in transgenic mice (Table 1\n). Interestingly, higher neutralisation titres were induced when tg-mice were injected with 10-fold more of rMV-S (Table 1, between brackets), meaning that immunisation with MV at 104\n pfu is not saturating the immune system of tg-mice. We also observed that the neutralisation titres to SARS-CoV and MV induced by rMV-S immunised mice persisted for a period of more than 6 months (until the termination of the experiments). Taken together, these results indicate that rMV-S efficiently primes and boosts SARS-CoV-specific neutralisation antibodies that persisted till the termination of experiments.",

One dose of 104\n pfu of UV-inactivated viruses was applied and ELISA titres were measured after 8 weeks. The results of Table 2\nshows that inactivated rMV-S failed to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV-S by ELISA. Only a replication efficient virus enabled induction of anti-SARS-CoV-S antibodies. UV-inactivated MV, however, induced anti-MV-antibodies but at a lower titre (2\u20133-fold lower titre than that of a replicating virus). The measured IgGs against MV is merely due to immunisation of tg-mice with the viral protein-oligomers (inactivated virus).

Using recombinant MV-SARS, our data confirm the feasibility of boosting anti-MV and SARS-specific immune responses in the presence of anti-MV immunity. Table 3\nindicates that mice immunised with rMV-N induced high ELISA titres (1:800) towards MV and SARS-CoV-N (1:400) readily at week 4 after the prime. Upon a boost with rMV-N at week 4, an increase of anti-MV and anti-N IgGs were measured at week 8. The end titres of anti-MV and anti-N antibodies increased significantly to 12,800 and 25,600, respectively, and were maintained at high levels up to 20 weeks. It could be argued that viruses, standard MV and rMV-N can boost anti-MV responses without the need for virus replication because essential MV-proteins are components of the virus. However, since SARS-CoV-N is not a structural part of the virion, a boost of anti-N antibody levels requires rMV-N to infect cells and express the additional transgenic SARS-CoV-N gene (that is encoded only by the viral genome). In fact, the failure of UV-inactivated rMV-S to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV-S strongly suggested that rMV replication in tg-mice is integral for the induction of antibodies against the vectored antigens (Table 2). Therefore, the considerable increase in anti-N antibodies after the boost with rMV-N is due to virus replication in the presence of pre-existing anti-MV antibodies. Similarly, but at 8 weeks post-immunisation, mice were boosted with rMV-S (expressing the SARS-CoV-S). An increase in SARS-CoV neutralisation titre was also observed (Table 3). Again, the boost of anti-SARS-CoV-S antibodies occurred in the presence of anti-MV antibodies.",

            "text": "The quest for a SARS vaccine manifested itself intensively after the outbreak. During the past years, several strategies against SARS were suggested as vaccines against SARS, including inactivated SARS-CoV, viral vectors such as adenovirus, vaccinia or rhabdovirus, recombinant SARS-CoV proteins, and DNA-based vaccines (reviewed by See et al. [39]). The surface glycoprotein S was employed as a primary target for prophylactic vaccine candidates to induce virus neutralising antibodies. In this report we also showed that the live attenuated recombinant MV vaccine induced high levels of neutralising anti-SARS-CoV antibodies. In addition, the recombinant MV expressing the SARS-CoV-N antigen induced humoral and cellular immune responses to the N protein. Although the addition of SARS-CoV genes increased the MV genome by 8\u201323%, the efficiency of its replication and ability to induce neutralising anti-MV antibodies were not affected. Interestingly, the immune responses towards MV and the vectored SARS-antigens persisted for more than 36 weeks (until the termination of the experiments), suggesting the suitability of rMV as a vaccine vector against SARS. Here, we do not claim a vaccine against SARS-CoV; however results obtained are a milestone towards further development in the future. Since MV tropism is limited to non-human primates, that pose an ethical hurdle, we did not perform the challenge studies. However, a quantitative comparison of the magnitude of neutralisation titres obtained in this study, together with previous studies, suggests that the highly persisting titres of neutralising anti-SARS antibodies might also be protective. Several studies in corona virus vaccine research, highlighted by experiences with a feline infectious peritonitis corona virus vaccine, reported enhancement of disease rather than protection of immunised subjects [40], [41], [42], [43]. Moreover, a study using recombinant MVA to express the S protein of SARS-CoV, showed enhanced hepatitis after a challenge in ferrets, despite the induction of neutralising antibodies [44]. Although such an effect was not observed in other applications and vectors (reviewed above), it is not known whether the ferret model faithfully reflects the symptoms and pathology of the human disease.",

T cell depletion and passive transfer of antibodies indicated that humoral immune responses to the S antigen appeared sufficient for protection [9], [11], [34], and that cellular immune responses appeared to play a limited role in protection. However, studies of animal corona viruses have suggested that both cellular and humoral immunity may contribute to protection [45], [46], [47]. Since SARS-CoV infection spreads systemically and is not confined to the respiratory tract, the induction of cellular immunity may constitute another boundary against virus infection and spread. Indeed, Kim et al. [48] observed significant reduction of challenge virus upon vaccination with recombinant DNA expressing SARS-N. This is in line with the hypothesis that CTL activity against SARS-CoV-N may be important for protection. The expression of N by rMV elicited quantitative cellular immune responses measured by IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assay. Compared to the previous report [48], the induction of cellular immunity by rMV is, therefore, qualitatively significant.",

In this context, a vaccine that combines SARS-CoV antigens that induce neutralisation (by S) and cellular immunity (by N) may constitute an ideal approach to consider. We performed experiments combining two rMVs (rMV-S and rMV-N) in one immunisation dose and demonstrated the induction of both humoral neutralising and cellular responses against SARS-CoV, and neutralising immunity against MV. The neutralising and cellular immunity induced by a single immunisation dose proves the suitability of rMVs as a multivalent vaccine approach.",

            "text": "The developed recombinant MVs are based on a MV vaccine strain that has a good record of safety and efficacy as a parenteral and mucosal vaccine [49]. Unlike other RNA viruses, the MV genome is very stable, and the recombinant vector stably expresses heterologous genes [17], [22], [23], making MV an ideal vaccine vector. It can be argued that the presence of anti-MV antibodies in the majority of the adult population might restrict application of MV recombinants to infants rather than adults [50]. However, several studies and the result from this report suggest that recombinant MV vaccines could be administered to pre-immunised humans for the following reasons:(i)Re-vaccination of already immunised school children with a measles vaccine, as aerosol and as parenteral vaccine, has been shown to result in a boost of anti-MV responses [35], [38], [49]. In addition, the presence of maternal antibodies was shown to limit the induction of anti-measles antibodies in infants during the first year in life; however, this did not inhibit specific T-cell responses [36], [37].(ii)Vaccination of pre-immunised mice and primates with recombinant MV-HIV has shown induction of anti-HIV-env antibodies in the presence of anti-MV antibodies [27].(iii)Finally, in this study, we observed a significant boost of anti-S and anti-N antibodies in mice pre-immunised with rMV-S and rMV-N.The results presented in this and the previous study [27] opens the possibility for using live attenuated MV-derived vectors to immunise adults. The optimal pre-existing antibody titre(s) allowing efficient immunisation, by the MV vector, however, will need to be determined in detail in the primate model to lay the ground for future clinical studies. Pursuing this technology, not only against SARS but also against other diseases, is considered promising because the MV vaccine is safe, even in HIV patients, highly immunogenic and among the most affordable vaccines used for mass immunisation campaigns worldwide.",
