The development of rapid and efficient automated platforms for the synthesis of nucleic acids and peptides from their monomeric building blocks (Figure 1 (a) and (b)\n) has led to a better understanding of the fundamental interactions these biomolecules play in important biological processes. As a result, the fields of genomics and proteomics have grown exponentially with the development of new therapeutic strategies for disease prevention and treatment. Until recently, the lack of a general and accessible approach for the construction of oligosaccharides meant that only specialized research laboratories were capable of accessing defined glycoconjugates. This has slowed the pace of research in this area and in turn, our understanding of the diverse roles of these compounds in nature.",

The synthesis of these glycoconjugates, which play important roles in the immune response to pathogenic fungi such as Candida albicans,2 began what would become a new chapter in the preparation of glycoconjugates for biological evaluation. Since then, automation has proven to be vastly beneficial. Additional bacterial antigens, cancer antigens, vaccine candidates, and N-linked core oligosaccharides are just a few of the glycoconjugates that have been rapidly synthesized using automation. Moreover, these glycoconjugates have been synthesized on scales that would have been impossible using standard solution-phase synthetic techniques.",

The general process is illustrated in Figure 3\n. Selectively functionalized monosaccharide building blocks containing temporary and permanent protecting groups (commonly referred to as donors) serve as electrophiles and are added sequentially to a growing oligosaccharide chain, which serves as a nucleophile (or acceptor). The acceptor is connected via an inert linker to a solid support that is generally insoluble in organic solvents. Each glycosidic linkage is made by activating the appropriately functionalized monosaccharide building block (donor) in the presence of the growing nucleophilic oligosaccharide (acceptor) to couple to the two molecules. After each glycosylation reaction, the growing oligosaccharide is washed, the appropriate temporary protecting groups are removed to expose the next functional group for coupling, and the process is repeated until the desired oligosaccharide has been synthesized. The oligosaccharide is then removed from the solid support, purified if necessary, and the remaining temporary and permanent protecting groups are removed. The oligosaccharide can then be functionalized for further study.",

The synthesizer was reliable, and solvent delivery and waste removal were relatively efficient. In addition, reaction mixing, which was achieved by agitation of the reaction vessel, was effective in producing a uniform heterogeneous solution. However, the instrument, which was designed for peptide synthesis, had several shortcomings. Reagent delivery, which was achieved via solenoid valves, was imprecise. Therefore, the delivery of small reagent volumes or the delivery of reagents at a controlled delivery rate was difficult to achieve. In addition, the system could not be modified to accommodate additional reagents limiting the number of different glycosylation reactions that could be performed in a single run. Finally, temperature control required manual adjustment of the cryostat therefore, necessitating the continuous presence of an operator. For these reasons, the Seeberger group focused their efforts on the development of a new fully automated solid-phase oligosaccharide synthesizer.",

The use of acetates as temporary protecting groups and the need to install a second mannose residue at the C6 position of the reducing sugar required that imidate 7, with a nonparticipating group at C2, be employed for this synthesis. Glycosylation of mannosyl imidate 7 on to the octenediol-functionalized Merrifield resin using the \u2018double coupling\u2019 strategy and stoichiometric amount of TMSOTf led to a mixture of \u03b1 and \u03b2 anomers.

Methanolysis of the C6 Ac to the corresponding hydroxyl group using Zempl\u00e9n conditions provided the corresponding nucleophile required for extension. Subsequent glycosylation/hydrolysis cycles with imidates 1, 8, and 9 gave the final tetrasaccharide in 44% yield after cleavage from the resin (approximately 82% coupling efficiency at each step).

Their new approach is illustrated in Scheme 13\n.8 The chitobiose core was installed using a \u2018double coupling\u2019 strategy with glucosylamine thioglyoside building block 14 functionalized with a TCA participating group at the C2 amine and a temporary Fmoc group on C4. Two glycosylation cycles were performed using an NIS/TfOH promoter system. Removal of the Fmoc group was accomplished between each cycle using piperidine to expose the next acceptor. The \u03b2-mannosidic linkage was then formed using mannosyl OCB building block 15 consisting of a nonparticipating benzylate at the C2 position, a temporary benzylidene acetal installed at the C4 and C6 positions, and a temporary silyl-protecting group at the C3 position, marking the first use of a benzylidene acetal and an OCB donor in automation. Glycosylation of the chitobiose disaccharide with 15 using triflic anhydride (Tf2O) and di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine (DTBMP), followed by removal of the silyl ether at C3 with TBAF and selective ring opening of the benzylidiene acetal using diborane and dibutylboron triflate (Bu2BOTf), gave the core N-linked trisaccharide which underwent subsequent glycosylation with mannosyl imidate 1. The final assembly of the core N-linked glycan was completed in 3.5% yield after cleavage from the resin under Zempl\u00e9n conditions; the \u03b2-mannosidic linkage was installed with an \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio of 1:3. Although the yields were far lower than the original synthesis of the core N-linked glycan, this work represents the first example of the direct generation of a beta-mannosidic linkage using an automated solid-phase platform.",

This has led to an increase in the general understating of the fundamental roles of these oligosaccharides in a number of biological processes. Current research is directed at identifying monosaccharide building blocks that can be used to access the major glycoconjugate classes including N-linked, O-linked, glycolipids, and glycosylaminoglycans. These oligosaccharides will be used to study important carbohydrate\u2013protein, carbohydrate\u2013nucleic acid, and carbohydrate\u2013carbohydrate interactions involved in normal and abnormal cellular processes. The development of rapid and efficient synthetic protocols for commercialization of these building blocks is the next critical step for expanding the automated solid-phase platform for oligosaccharide synthesis.",
