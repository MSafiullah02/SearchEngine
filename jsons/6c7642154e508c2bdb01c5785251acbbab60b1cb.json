However, other common early-stage cancers (breast, prostate, cervical, nonmelanoma skin) may not. The quality of evidence in some cases is inadequate to support \"one size fits all\" statements applicable to every patient. However, experienced oncology providers should feel confident exercising judgment regarding which patients need to initiate or continue treatment owing to their tumor's more aggressive biology versus those who can tolerate a delay. Decision making may change as efforts by the health care system to mitigate risks for exposure to COVID-19 improve (5) . Indeed, consensus recommendations swiftly began to appear to help providers make appropriate triage decisions (6) . For persons with advanced oncologic disease, futility of treatment in the context of COVID-19 must be frankly considered and discussed.",
