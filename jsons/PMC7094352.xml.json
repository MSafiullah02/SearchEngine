Bioaerosols can cause serious health hazards when they contaminate a human environment. The influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and the avian and swine flu are natural examples illustrating the profound, everyday impacts of bioaerosols on public health (Jung, Lee, & Kimet, 2009). Virus particles are only nanometers in size, so they can remain suspended in the air long enough to be dispersed (Joe, Park, & Hwang, 2016). Filtration is one of the most common methods for removing airborne particulates. It has been applied in various situations, including personal facepiece respirators and central heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems of buildings because it can achieve a high removal efficiency of aerosol particles. Fibrous filters are simple and economical devices capable of efficiently removing submicrometer particles (Wang and Otani, 2013, Sim et al., 2015). Typical filters work using conventional mechanical mechanisms (i.e., impaction, interception, and diffusion). For improving the filtration efficiency and decreasing the pressure drop, electric fields are applied and/or charging particles are used.",

Kim, Sioutas, and Chang (2000) utilized a stainless-steel fibrous filter as the ground electrode of a point-to-plate electrostatic precipitator so that the particle-laden flow passed through the filter. Inculet et al. (2002) used pseudoelectret fibers consisting of two very-fine-diameter wires that were assembled closely together but electrically isolated from each other with a Teflon coating. When a voltage was applied to the wires, a local high-intensity electric field was produced between the two wires, and charged particles were attracted by the assembly.",

Carbon-fiber ionizers produce stable unipolar ions in sufficiently high concentrations with little ozone generation and secondary particles (Han et al., 2008, Park, Yoon, Kim, Byeon, & Hwang (2009), Kim, Yoon, Park, & Hwang (2011), Noh et al. (2011), Park, Yoon, & Hwang (2011)). Thus, they have been considered for use in indoor air purifiers to generate air ions. Park et al. (2009) installed carbon-fiber ionizers in front of a fibrous medium filter to study the effect of air ions on the inactivation of Escherichia coli. Kim et al. (2009) also used carbon-fiber ionizers and studied the antibacterial effects of air ions with different ion exposure times, ion concentrations, polarities of generated ions, and different kinds of bacteria. Lee, Hyun, and Hwang (2014) inactivated aerosolized Staphylococcus epidermidis using both positive and negative air ions simultaneously to achieve a higher inactivation efficiency. Many researchers have studied ionizers for inactivation of bioaerosols; however, the elimination of airborne viruses has not been considered. Huang et al. (2008) performed a removal test of the influenza virus A strain (H11N9) with unipolar air ions. They reported the removal efficiency achieved not by inactivation but by filtration.",

To aerosolize the virus particles, 0.1 mL of the virus solution was diluted with 50 mL of deionized water. The diluted virus solution was aerosolized with a Collison\u2010type atomizer (9302, TSI Inc., USA). Dry clean air of 2 L/min formed a high-velocity jet through an orifice in the atomizer. The pressure drop caused by this jet drew the virus solution up through a tube. The solution was then broken into droplets by the high-velocity air jet. The resultant larger droplets impinged on an impactor, while the smaller droplets made no contact and formed an aerosol that exited through an outlet. The aerosolized viruses passed through a diffusion dryer for water removal and a neutralizer (Soft X-ray Charger 4530, HCT, Korea) to induce a Boltzmann charge distribution. Another portion of clean air was delivered to the test duct and mixed with the particle-laden air flow. The mixture flow rate was varied among 28.8, 48.0, and 96.0 L/min in order to achieve flow velocities of 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 m/s, respectively.",

However, for particles smaller than 15 nm, the increments of the efficiency were indistinguishable, as very small particles have low charge numbers and are thus difficult to be measured. Data analysis was performed for Fig. 5 using paired t-test with SPSS Statistics Version 23. There was a significant average difference between filtration efficiencies (tfilter-ionizer=10.292, tfilter-field=17.813, p<0.05 for both).",

The results imply that the chance of contact between the virus and air ions might increase when there were both positive and negative ions. Lee et al.

Their bipolar ion treatment affected the antibacterial efficiency, which increased as the number of charges in the ion polarity increased and the flow velocity decreased. Noyce and Hughes (2002) explained that electrostatic interactions with numerous charged groups in the cell wall could possibly induce a physiological change in the cell wall structure. Digel, Artmann, Nishikawa, Cook, Kurulgan, and Artmann (2005) reported that when negatively and positively charged ions were applied to test bacteria, after contact and sedimentation of the bipolar ions onto bacterial surfaces, hydroxyl radicals appeared in the cell wall as a result of chemical interactions between the positive ions and the negative ions. As a result of these reactions, the hydroxyl radicals damaged proteins and lipids (Nishikawa & Nojima, 2003).",

After the ionizer was operated in a bipolar mode, all of the positive and negative air ions were eliminated using an ion trap with 20 V of applied voltage. Then the remaining ozone of 30 ppb concentration was carried by air flow to the test duct. When the virus particles captured in a filter were exposed to the ozone flow for 45 minutes, it was found that the antiviral efficiency of ozone was 4.52% which was much lower than that of bipolar ions (please remind that the antiviral efficiency was 96.4%, when the virus particles were exposed to both the ozone and bipolar ions for 45 minutes).
