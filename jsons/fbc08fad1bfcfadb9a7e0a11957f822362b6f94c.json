However, since the conditions of these COVID-19 patients are quickly worsening as described in the results section, and by our clinicians' judgments, it would be difficult for these patients to recover by themselves or by conventional treatment methods during the treatment period. Thus, one could generally regard the conditions before plasminogen treatment are these patients' own controls, so called single arm study. Above all, the key findings of rapid clinical improvements by just plasminogen inhalation are stunning. This means that plasminogen inhalation is an efficient and effective method to relieve the COVID-19 patients from the hyaline membrane formation and ARDS. As ARDS is the key event that can quickly worsen the COVID-19 lung conditions from flulike discomfort to multi-organ failures and even death. We speculate that, if this treatment method can be used more extensively at a larger scale, especially to patients with clinical conditions quickly turning from moderate to severe or critical, we might significantly lower the death rate and the severity of this terrible epidemic emergency. Notwithstanding, before the above conclusions can be firmly made, randomized controlled trials and additional examination parameters and methods are needed to determine the efficacy and optimize the safety profile of plasminogen for treatment of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, such work is currently being carried on by our team.",

Although in most cases the disease is acute and can be resolved by itself, in severe or critical cases, patients may suffer and even die from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, and other serious complications, mainly due to massive diffuse alveolar damage and early hyaline membrane formation. 4, 5 As a predominant and early pathological feature, formed hyaline membranes consist of fibrin matrix incorporating the whole spectrum of serum proteins and cellular debris, 6-8 which forms a barrier to inhibit gas exchange and pulmonary surfactant resulting in ARDS. Moreover, in hyaline membrane disease of premature infants, fibrin deposition in alveoli and alveolar ducts is a crucial factor that may result in death. 9, 10 The plasminogen activator (PA) system is a broad-spectrum protease system where the active component, plasmin, is formed from its precursor, plasminogen and is important in degrading main components of the extracellular matrix including fibrin. Plasminogen is classically regarded as inert and excessive, and the regulation of the PA system is by the activators and inhibitors of the system. 11 However, we have shown before that plasminogen itself is a key regulator in many pathological processes including fibrinolysis, wound healing and infection. [12] [13] [14] [15] Previous studies have demonstrated different results on whether plasminogen is sufficient in ARDS.",

[19] [20] Hence, although hyaline membrane disease in premature infants and COVID-19 pneumonia mainly in normal adults have completely distinct etiologies, inspired by our previous studies, we hypothesize that additional plasminogen supplementation to these COVID-19 patients may still benefit them. As the first attempt, in the current study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of plasminogen by atomization inhalation on COVID-19. The results suggest that using plasminogen by atomization inhalation is an effective and efficient way to combat this rapid epidemic emergency.",

Despite the 5 patients received the daily common supportive treatments with antibiotics and traditional Chinese medicine, the density and range of 'ground glass' opacities in lung increased over time, suggesting a rapid deleterious progress of the disease (CT scanning examination record, not shown here). Surprisingly, just after 2-3 times of plasminogen inhalation, the CT results showed that the numbers, the range and the density of lung lesion-focal in all of the 5 patients treated have diminished or even partially disappeared. Patchy or punctate 'ground glass' opacities have significantly decreased or absorbed.
