In resource-poor settings, inadequate human resources and training present additional barriers to safe and effective use of lifesaving procedures. Simple interventions, such as early recognition and treatment of cardio-respiratory failure, low tidal volume mechanical ventilation, early appropriate antimicrobial treatment, physical therapy, deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcer prophylaxis, require little specialized equipment but are crucial to successful outcome of critically ill patients [4] . Accordingly, these interventions have to be systematically implemented without omission or delay. This seemingly simple and straightforward task has proven to be an enormous challenge and nothing but a distant dream in hospitals worldwide.",

Embracing a safety culture, limiting the number of steps ('less is more'), enhancing and prompting clear prioritized information, patient-and familycentered care delivery (integration of values, beliefs and advanced directives), improved communication and coordination (hand-offs, physician extenders) are all needed for safe and efficient critical care delivery. Considering the exponential spreading of medical knowledge, it appears obvious that clinician memory cannot store and retrieve all of it, particularly during acute care support [9] . Medical textbooks and current guidelines provided by major scientific societies display exhaustive information for best practice, but may be complex to use as an efficient decision support at the point-of-care [11] . Multiple tools have recently been developed, tested and validated to enhance both efficiency and fidelity of acute care delivery. These include: Multidisciplinary rounds, daily goals of care sheets, smart alarms, dashboards and decision supports. Analogous to the complex industry environment (e. g., aviation, nuclear power plants), simplified checklists and care 'bundles' have been recently introduced on a large scale in various medical settings (Table 2) [12, 13] .",

The non-linear trajectory and time-sensitive nature of acute critical illness is characteristic of the complex systems [26] . During the vulnerable period immediately prior to 'phase transition', seemingly minor errors, omissions or delays can profoundly alter the patient trajectory. Simple interventions (fluid bolus, oxygen, transfusion, thrombolytic reperfusion), while beneficial during early hours of critical illness may lose effectiveness or even become harmful later in the course of critical illness (after the 'phase transition') [27] . The importance of timely recognition and appropriate treatment of acute critical illness is nicely illustrated in Fig. 1 , showing the importance of minute delays in the rapid application of basic critical care support to patients in shock [28] . More recently, a multicenter quality improvement intervention targeting patients with severe sepsis in the emergency department showed that rapid implementation of early bundle elements (i. e., appropriate empiric antimicrobials, fluid bolus, lactate) was associated with aborted progression of organ failures making the patients \"ineligible\" for subsequent bundle elements (inotropes, steroids, transfusions, low tidal volume ventilation for ARDS) [29] .",

The timely and appropriate management of these key presentations followed by syndromic diagnoses (shock, respiratory failure, increased intracranial pressure, acute coronary syndrome, etc.), often without full understanding of the underlying condition, constitutes the basics of the acute care of critically ill patients. Keeping in mind the challenges clinicians are facing during early stages of acute critical illness, and the fact that experienced specialist help is often delayed, it is not difficult to imagine the advantages of a systematic and disciplined method that can consistently combine and articulate key diagnostic and therapeutic interventions [35] . Of note, even experienced clinicians are prone to making basic errors during emergency situations exposing patients to harm and clinicians to litigation [36] . [37] . In the 1970 s, Dr. Styner extended the context of the initial ABC approach for the evaluation of critically injured trauma patients and formed the basis of the Advanced Trauma Life Support courses [38] . The ABCDE approach has been implemented into trauma settings successfully for many years. Box 2 provides an example of the ABCDE checklist suitable for various acute care environments. The advantage of the structured approach to life-threatening emergencies has been elegantly demonstrated in a recent study [18] . In this study, the use of checklists by operating room teams markedly decreased critical omissions (23 % vs. 6 %, p < 0.001) in a high fidelity simulation of 106 surgical crises scenarios. Unfortunately, apart from CPR, which is too late, a similar checklist approach is largely missing during golden hours outside operating room and trauma settings [36] . Figure 3 outlines the key elements of a structured approach to acute lifethreatening illness or injury: Primary survey to address immediate life-threats (need for CPR, ABCDE bundle) followed by secondary survey to assess each organ system, identify relevant syndromes and, in parallel, initiate emergent therapies.",

In the current system, much of the effort in critical care is reactionary rather than proactive in implementing best practices aimed at preventing complications. A structured, reliable and error-free approach to the management of acutely ill or injured patients during the early, most vulnerable period is facilitated by point-of-care checklists and algorithms containing brief prioritized information. This approach is rapidly spreading in trauma and operating room settings and other acute care environments should follow soon.",
