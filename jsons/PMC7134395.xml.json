The primary intervention method for preventing transmission of infectious diseases is vaccination. However, the decisions whether to vaccinate themselves can evolve in time depending on the epidemic incidence observed in the population  [6]. That is because in deciding whether to vaccinate themselves, people consider the risk of morbidity from vaccination, the probability that they will become infected, and the risk of morbidity from such an infection  [7], [8], [9]. However, the game theoretical approach could be suitable to describe the decision-making processes  [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15].",

Zhang  [20]  et al. investigated Braess\u2019s Paradox in epidemic game, the results indicated that improving the successful rate of self-protection does not necessarily suppress the epidemic or increase the whole society payoff. By using game theory, Timothy  [21] investigated the social distancing in response to an epidemic. The results showed that social distancing is most beneficial to individuals for basic reproduction numbers around 2. Based on the probabilistic cellular automaton, Schimita  [22]  et al. proposed a vaccination game according to public health actions and personal decisions in which the players are the government and the susceptible newborns. The results supported showed the disease is not fully eliminated and the government implements quasi-periodic vaccination campaigns. Alessio  [23]  et al. analyzed the evolution of voluntary vaccination in scale-free networks and random networks. The results showed that if the vaccine is perfect, scale-free networks enhance the vaccination behavior, however, imperfection may lead to a cross-over effect. Eunha Shim  [24]  et al. investigated the game dynamic model of the vaccine skeptics and vaccine believers. They demonstrated that the pursuit of vaccine skeptics-interest among vaccine skeptics often leads to vaccination levels that are suboptimal for a population, even if complete coverage is achieved among vaccine believers. Han  [25]  et al. studied how the memory and conformism effect on epidemic processes. Their results indicated if the individuals make decision mostly depending on their own payoffs and do not believe too much in the celebrity, the final recovered number will be significantly reduced.",

            "text": "In many social, biological, and physical systems the interactions among the elements of the system are rapidly changing  [26], [27]. In recent years, there have been extensive research activities on time-varying networks, or called temporal networks, which evolve on a time scale comparable to the timescale of the propagation process  [28], [29]. The time-varying structure of link activations affects the network dynamics, from disease contagion to information diffusion  [30], [31]. The role of individual behavior in the spreading of epidemic diseases is becoming increasingly important due to increased travel activity on both short (commuting) and long (leisure or business trips) space and time scales  [32], [33]. Bhushan  [34]  et al. investigated the epidemics process on adaptive time varying networks. Their results showed the interaction patterns of the infected population play a major role in sustaining the epidemic. Michele  [35]  et al. explored the immunization strategies for epidemic processes in time-varying contact networks. Their results suggested that the strong variation of temporal networks, however, limits the efficiency of immunization strategy. Liu  [36]  et al. investigated the contagion processes in activity driven networks. They derived the critical immunization threshold and assessed the effectiveness of three different control strategies. However, the characterization and modeling of time-varying networks are still open and active areas of research  [37], [38]. On the other hand, the researchers often make an assumption on the activity driven network: each activated vertex connects with the other nodes randomly. However, this assumption sometime is unreasonable. That is because the link between the individuals is subject to some certain laws. For example, a Chinese person will connect the other Chinese more often than American people. Generally speaking, an individual may contact his old friends more frequent than other strangers.",

We set a closeness parameter p which is used to describe the way of connection between two individuals. We first investigate the case that vaccination is not allowed. The results show that under different closeness p the final density of recovered increases with the value of \u03bb/\u03bc. However, when vaccination is allowed, under different closeness p the final density of recovered individual first increases and then decreases with the value of \u03bb/\u03bc. Besides, the results point out that the closeness p may have an active role in weakening both the spreading of epidemic and the vaccination. In order to identify the relationship between the individuals\u2019 activities and their states, we design two variables. The results indicate the recovered frequency increases with the increases of the individuals\u2019 activities. Meanwhile, the immune fee has less impact on individuals\u2019 vaccination than the closeness p. With the increase of the value of \u03bb/\u03bc, the recovered frequency of the whole crowds reduces. From the perspective of human behaviors, our findings reveal that the best of intentions may lead to backfire.",

However, this assumption sometime is unreasonable. In general, the link between the individuals is subject to some certain laws. For example, a Chinese person may connect the other Chinese people more often than American people. More generally, an individual may connect with his old friends more frequent than other strangers. The topology of the pattern of contacts between individuals plays a fundamental role in determining the spreading patterns of epidemic processes. In this paper, we research a modified activity driven network. We set a closeness parameter p which is used to describe the way of connection between individuals. Considering a network with N nodes, the epidemic processes in an epidemic cycle (the epidemic cycle is defined in the following) can be described as follows.(1)At each discrete time step t, a network Gt with N nodes and zero edges is generated.(2)Each vertex i becomes active with probability \u03b1i and generates n links. Taking into account the two ways of connection in activity driven network: Each link is connected to the node which has been connected with probability p (we assume if an activated individual has not connected with others, this node will select other nodes randomly). Otherwise, it will connect with an arbitrary node with probability 1\u2212p. Note that when the closeness p=1, all the individuals only connect with the individuals who have been connected, otherwise the individual select others randomly when the closeness p=0.(3)The epidemic model rules are run on the obtained network. Considering the classical compartmental Susceptible\u2013Infected\u2013Recovered (SIR) model, there are three compartments which are susceptible S, infected I and recovered R in the population. At each time step, all individuals update their states in a synchronous way. More specifically, a susceptible node can be infected with a probability \u03bb if it is connected to an infected node. At the same time, the infected nodes may heal to a recovered state with a probability \u03bc. The epidemic process can be characterized by the following equations: (1)\n(4)At time t+1, all the links in the network Gt are removed, and the process starts again from step (1).\n",

Interestingly, we find that a large closeness p is responsible for not only constraining the epidemic diffusion within localized groups but preventing people to vaccinate. Also we may get, no matter how the immune cost is, the average final density of vaccination reduces with the increase of the closeness p. At the same time, the average final vaccination density minimum coincides with peaks in the average final recovered density. Although the individuals may feel crisis according to the outside information (such as TV, broadcast, Internet, newspaper, and so on), however, such crisis awareness is far less than that when they get know their friends are infected. Therefore, if the individuals only connect with limited people, that would weaken their crisis awareness. As a result, people would not take immune even if the disease exists in the network. That would sharply increase the probability of individuals to be infected. However, if the effective number of \u201cacquaintance\u201d becomes smaller and the closeness p is bigger enough (in this paper the p is close to 0.7), the total recovered individuals will reduce with the increase of the closeness p.
