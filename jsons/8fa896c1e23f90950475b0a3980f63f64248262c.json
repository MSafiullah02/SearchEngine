In a cohort of 41 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-2019, it was reported that intensive care unit (ICU) patients had higher plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines in serum, such as IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1, in comparison with non-ICU patients [8] . According to such pathogenetic mechanism, 21 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in China have been treated with Tocilizumab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor, achieving promising results. This led to a series of randomized, controlled trial for the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in the treatment of COVID-19 in Europe and China, confirming the importance of turning off the excessive immune response that occurs in the later stages of the disease.",

Indeed, it is likely that the SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs asymptomatically or with mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization; the prevalence of smoking in these cases is unknown and actually it does not help the clarify the association between smoking and severity of pneumonia. Therefore, it is not currently possible to establish the real prevalence of smoking among all individuals affected with COVID-19. However, according to the studies published so far, smokers represent a minority among hospitalized patients. It would be interesting to investigate the spread of smoking among asymptomatic individuals or those with few symptoms, in order to clarify whether smoking is a real risk factor not only for the clinical course but also for contracting and manifesting the infection.",
