Those who can be identified as ICD-11 case are not globally well known, but suspicious cases are roughly estimated as adults (approximately 4.2 million) and youths (approximately a million) in Japan (data at 2017).",

Those assessed data might intend to statistically reveal our strength of mental health and degree of adaptation in social relations, and then automatic prediction for those who answered personality tests enables to trustfully measure financial limitations for loans and transactions in actual contexts. Therefore, our mental conditions and its social adaptations, to date, have been unveiled by such ways, and those applied services could be built for somewhat vigilance system on mutual trust among citizens. Mental disorder and maladaptation of each individual have possibilities to further pervade unsound influences among the others, and vice versa.

But case studies often mean that there are no effective ways to explore future patterns and expectations based on past clinical cases in the daily interactions (Leary 1983; Kircher and Leube 2003). Traditionally, the clinical psychological way is usually beneficial to manage mental dynamics that are impossible to be generalized and formalized. Clinical psychology and its fundamental assumptions usually hesitate to do generalizations from clinical case studies. That is because each personal condition and mental distress may be too individualized, and rather researchers in this field recommend qualitative and intensive caring ways for understanding each personal experiences embedded in actual conditions.",

Traditionally, those fields must be accumulated from onsite clinical data on diagnosis of patients and analyze statistical trends which localized in each region. Regarding these concerns, to date, online query results mostly reflect citizens\u2019 intentions and latent needs for specific actual events in society. Recently, Ginsberg and his colleagues (2009) had unveiled such facts by their big data, and their findings by statistical analyzations on logistic positive correlations between actual trends of data from CDC4 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA) and web-query data among citizens had become a pioneer for big-data age. Namely this study clearly suggested that citizens were usually apt to seek more accurate and necessary information in uncertainty conditions such as disaster (see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-15-2248-2_10), unwelcome infectious disease, terrorism, and other fascinated events. Their study seemed to be a first breakthrough for researches using web data analysis. As an implication of this finding, many researchers realized significant meanings on synchronizing and corresponding evidence between web trends and offline events. Namely \u201cbig data\u201d can be analyzed by computational engineering methodologies such as artificial intelligence, statistical machine learning techniques, and natural languages processing, and it can open the gate to investigate novel findings automatically.",

Seasonal trends on influenza can be also recognized in each year, and only bizarre peak around the middle of this year can be specified.

How did daily belief systems among Fukushima na\u00efve citizens against the safety surrounding in nuclear power plants deal with? Their attitudes had been rather steadily stabilizing among many of them before the crisis. However, risk cognition, social constructive senses of reality, and meaningful understanding against nuclear disasters among citizens would be collapsed in those conditions.

Many of those systems such as computational controls and sensing networking related to power plants and sensitive artifacts will be impossible to keep under controls unless electric power can be continually provided. Nuclear power plants and its control systems per se always also require independent electric power for controlling those mechanisms. Serial incidents of the Fukushima nuclear power plants can be determined by the serious factors on both the loss of external electric power supply and vent malfunctions for refrigerating systems caused by tremendous tsunami attacks. Besides, until now, the AI-driven robots sensing inner-damaged power plants cannot be activated over the physical limitations because inner-damaged power plants still remain with higher radiation dose (i.e., the human dies immediately and computational mechanisms will be disabled by radiations sooner). Then, the lessons for the digitized future must be intensively deduced and learned by convincible investigations. In the USA, after this disaster, a taskforce team was immediately assembled for investigations to report the cause of the nuclear power plants, reconstruction of the nuclear power plants for safety, and future policy on energy management in the USA (NRC 2011). Their 12 recommendations within this report should be carefully read for future engineers.",
