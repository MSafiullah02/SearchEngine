            "text": "\n\u2018Public Health surveillance is the ongoing systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of health data, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data both to those providing the data and to those who can apply the data to control and prevention programs\u2019.\n1\nPublic health surveillance is therefore, closely linked to action as it provides accurate and validated information to local and national health authorities in order that these same authorities can implement appropriate prevention and control measures and health promotion strategies.\n2\nThis definition was set up several decades ago. Since then, the adoption of the revised International Health Regulations in 2005 has implemented new regulations such as national obligations to guarantee a set of core surveillance and response capacities to prevent international spread of disease irrespective of its origin (biological but also chemical or radio-nuclear sources).\n3\nFurthermore, new diseases have emerged (H1N1pdm09, Middle East Coronavirus), some others have spread dramatically such Ebola virus disease in West Africa.\n4\nIn the context of globalisation, the concept of public health surveillance has evolved to include public health security.\n5,6\nPoliticians and stakeholders rely upon their public health agencies to be informed in a timely fashion and to be able to respond promptly to all potential health treats that may arise as populations need protection whatever the risk. For public health surveillance, this implies the need to monitor a very large spectrum of all hazards health threats. At the same time, as many public agencies are currently facing budgetary constraints, they must allocate theirs resources as efficiently as possible, as surveillance systems cannot be implemented for all known health threats. The priorities for diseases surveillance need to be reviewed regularly in order to guarantee that the most topical public health issues are consistently tackled and to ensure quality and effectiveness of surveillance. Furthermore, best practice recommends periodic evaluation of public health surveillance systems (PHSS).\n7\nLike other national public health agencies,\n8\nthe French National Institute of Public Health (InVS) has implemented several prioritization exercises to guide its own surveillance strategy.\n9\u201311\nIt has also implemented an external and formal evaluation process of its surveillance systems, based on a generic evaluation protocol drawn up in accordance with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines,\n12\nand using a design developed by the European Center for Diseases Prevention and Control (protocol provided by Dr A. Ammon, personal communication). Four surveillance systems for infectious diseases were assessed between 2009 and 2013.\n13\nGiven the current economic context, this assessment process was less than comprehensive as it did not consider the increasingly important question of the costs and the benefits of surveillance systems. The CDC guidelines\n12\nindicate that costs should not be estimated alone but be judged relative to benefits or at least relative to the effects of the surveillance system on prevention, care, research or decision-making. The guidelines state also that \u2018a more realistic approach would be to judge costs on the objectives and usefulness of the system\u2019. However, the CDC guidelines do not clearly define methods to do so. A WHO report issued in 2005 underlined that the evaluation of the costs and the benefits of national surveillance and response systems was an area of great importance. In the report, the authors indicated that little related work has been carried out to that point and highlighted a number of methodological difficulties in evaluating benefits of a surveillance and response system such as implementing the appropriate study design, defining the scope of the surveillance or assigning a monetary value to health outcomes averted.\n14",

These three studies have estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness (or cost-utility) ratio for the more efficient strategy. The fourth cost-effectiveness study focused on HIV surveillance. The authors of that study were not able to estimate the number of cases prevented by the HIV surveillance activities alone (which constituted only a part of the entire HIV prevention program). To overcome this methodological issue, the authors defined a level of cost-effectiveness based on a median value of ratios of 116 cost-effectiveness published studies. Based on this ratio, they estimated the number of HIV infections the entire HIV prevention program would need to prevent in order for it to be considered cost-effective.\n21",

The theory behind this approach is that any product or good or service can be described by a set of characteristics and that the extent to which an individual places value on a product is determined by the level of these characteristics.\n34\nCA asks individuals to state a preference by presenting competing scenarios with both desirable and undesirable characteristics of a product or a service. CA has been applied to health care and public health interventions such as HIV vaccine and cancer control strategies.\n35,36\nMore recently, CA was performed to prioritize zoonotic diseases of public health concern.\n37\nCA has been also used to derive utility weight for QALY or to estimate willingness to pay for CB analysis.\n38\nTo our knowledge, the method has not been used for a PHSS and may be worth exploring. Indeed, this type of economic evaluation could help policy makers and health professionals elicit preferences and help estimate their willingness to pay for a surveillance system according to different system characteristics and performance. This technique may also be useful for estimating the non-use value of a surveillance program.\n39\nThis information could be useful to public health agencies and could help them to prioritize surveillance in a context of limited resources.\n",

Conversely, had we used a query with the term \u2018Public health surveillance\u2019 we would have identified only seven references, none of which being one of those finally selected. Additionally, focusing on public health surveillance evaluation and displaying the different types of studies (economic versus non-economic) led to a much higher number of articles (over 1200 articles) and did not retrieve the selected studies. However, the fact that this review is extensive and that the majority of the selected studies (8/9) were identified in both databases proves that few economic evaluations of a PHSS have been performed to date and that the risk of having missed an article is most probably very low.",

Third, this article did not aim to critically review the quality of the selected studies. Certain methodological issues are pointed out in this article to underline how difficult it is sometimes to perform a full economic analysis in the field of public health surveillance. Finally, our primary objective was to look at the methods used in the economic evaluation of a PHSS. We did not focus on the results of these economic analyses despite the fact that in most of these studies, the authors considered the surveillance system in question either cost-effective or cost-beneficial.\n",

The most frequent approach employed to assess these benefits is to value the health outcomes prevented by the surveillance and response activities or to estimate the costs per number of health outcomes avoided by comparing two surveillance strategies. By using these approaches, other dimensions are overlooked. As an alternative, using other economic methods such as conjoint analysis could show promise for future development.",
