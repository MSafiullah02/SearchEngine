Recent studies revealed that SARS-Cov 2 is related to bat-SL-CoV ZC45 and bat-SL-CoV ZXC21 [2] and can spread from human to human, mainly through respiratory droplets, physical contact, and the oral-fecal route [3].",

Furthermore, in most patients, lung imaging findings are observed earlier than clinical symptoms, which make imaging examinations crucial for screenings and an accurate diagnosis [5]. Chest CT is now the routine for patients with COVID-19 pneumonia at many institutions. In our experience, some patients with positive CT findings may have initial negative result before they were finally confirmed as COVID-19 pneumonia, and they were easily misdiagnosed as common types of viral pneumonia, especially in the non-epidemic area. In addition, there have been a few reports about COVID-19 pneumonia findings on chest CT [5\u201311]; however, the reported CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia were extremely similar to common types of viral pneumonia. To the best of our knowledge, no study so far has compared CT findings between COVID-19 pneumonia and other types of viral pneumonia. Hence, the primary objective of our study was to compare the pulmonary CT findings of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with those with other types of viral pneumonia.",

First, we examined group differences in all variables between patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and patients with other types of viral pneumonia. The Kruskal-Wallis H test (skewed distribution) and chi-square tests (categorical variables) were used to determine statistical differences between the two groups. Second, a univariate regression analysis was applied to estimate effect sizes for the relationships between all variables and two types of viral pneumonia. Last, multivariable logistic models were used to evaluate the associations between exposure (imaging characteristics) and outcome (viral pneumonia). These models included model 1 (not adjusted for other co-variants), model 2 (adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index [BMI]), and model 3 (adjusted for the same factors as model 2 as well as for other significantly associated clinical and imaging characteristics in univariate regression analysis).

Seven consecutive patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, 5 males (mean age, 47.80 years; age range, 28\u201375 years) and 2 females (mean age, 59 years; age range, 47\u201371 years), were included at Changhai Hospital between January 25 and February 9, 2020. One hundred consecutive adult patients with other types of viral pneumonia, 55 males (mean age, 52.98 years; age range, 20\u201391 years) and 45 females (mean age, 51.13 years; age range, 20\u201395 years), were included at Changhai Hospital between April 2011 and December 2020. The patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and the other types of viral pneumonia were confirmed by viral nucleic acid detection (Fig. 1). The 154 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia included 114 moderate cases (74.03%) and 40 severe cases (25.97%). The 100 patients with other types of viral pneumonia included 40 cases (40.0%) of Epstein-Barr virus infections, 29 cases (29.0%) of cytomegalovirus infections, three cases (3.0%) of adenovirus infections, and 28 cases (28.0%) of influenza infections. The interval from the onset of symptoms to the positive CT findings was 8 days (range 4\u201313 days) and 8 days (range 3\u201315 days) in COVID-19 pneumonia group and the other viral pneumonia group, respectively. Among the clinical and imaging characteristics that we investigated, we found significant differences in smoking history, presence of cough, lymphocyte ratios, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, distribution, maximum lesion range, lobe involvement, hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement, and pleural effusion between patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and those with other types of viral pneumonia (p > 0.05).

            "text": "The present study does also provide some new findings. Firstly, we found that a peripheral distribution was associated with a 13.04-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with a diffuse distribution. Furthermore, a maximum lesion range > 10 cm was associated with a 9.75-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with a maximum lesion range \u2264 5 cm, and the involvement of 5 lobes was associated with an 8.45-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia, compared with the involvements of lobes \u2264 2. These findings show that the larger area and more lobes were involved in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia than in those with other types of viral pneumonia, but the distribution was peripheral, which was different from the diffuse distribution of the other vital pneumonia. Secondly, no pleural effusion was associated with a 3.58-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia compared with the presence of pleural effusion. This finding was associated with few alveolar exudations of interstitial pneumonitis. Notably, hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement was found in a few patients and was observed in 43.51% and 20.0% of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and other types of viral pneumonia, respectively. However, hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement was associated with a 2.79-fold risk of COVID-19 pneumonia. This result was different from the study by Bernheim et al [19]. The following reasons would lead to the difference. First, we only included the positive CT finding; however, Bernheim\u2019s study included 20/35 (56%) negative CT findings. Second, the interval from the onset of symptoms to the positive CT findings in this study was different from that in Bernheim\u2019s study. We speculate that hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement is associated with immune responses and that patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have stronger immune responses than those with other types of vital pneumonia, especially in the moderate and severe patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.",

Secondly, all patients with a negative chest CT were excluded, as well as patients with other non-infectious chest CT findings, which could lead to potential inclusion bias and weaken our findings. Thirdly, there may have been a supplementary selection bias in these institutions in terms of which patients were imaged with CT. For instance, patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 pneumonia usually underwent a CT scan, while mild or asymptomatic patients do not. Fourthly, some patients may have received medical intervention once suspected or confirmed to have infection, which was not accounted for in this work. Finally, the group with other types of viral pneumonia only included common viruses and might not be a significant representation of all viral infections.",
