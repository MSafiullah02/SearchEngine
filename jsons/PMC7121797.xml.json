IFNs induce hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), whereby many are regulated by all IFNs, and others are induced more selectively (de Veer et al. 2001; Der et al. 1998). Even for several long-known ISG-encoded proteins with direct or indirect antiviral activity, the mechanisms of action are often still poorly understood. Studies on antiviral activities of specific proteins became more complicated than anticipated, largely because of their high virus-specificity and their involvement in multiple pathways, including normal cellular physiology. Moreover, viral counteracting mechanisms can be very efficient and mechanistic discoveries often depended on mutant viruses. As another level of complexity, some of the antiviral effector proteins also have proviral effects.3\n",

Molecules and signalling cascades involved have been mainly characterized during the last decade and new players are still being identified. A number of germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) sense the presence of so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PRRs involved in host defence against viruses are localized in several cellular compartments and recognize distinct molecular structures, most prominently viral nucleic acids. Activation of distinct PAMP-induced signalling cascades converge in most cases at the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs (Kawai and Akira 2009; McCartney and Colonna 2009).",

Type I IFNs are the key cytokines for innate antiviral immunity, as they are rapidly induced upon virus recognition and act on presumably all cell types. Type I IFNs have been discovered more than 50 years ago and comprise a large group of cytokines. Among these, several distinct IFN\u03b1 subtypes (13 in humans) and IFN\u03b2 are induced directly in response to viral infections. Type II IFN consists of only one member, IFN\u03b3, that is mainly produced by activated T cells and natural killer (NK) cells (Pestka et al. 2004). Type III IFNs are structurally more related to the interleukin- (IL-) 10 cytokine family, but have been classified as IFNs based on their similar biological activity as IFN\u03b1/\u03b2. In humans, this family has three members, IFN\u03bb1\u2013IFN\u03bb3, originally designated as interleukin IL-29, IL-28A and IL-28B, respectively. IFN\u03bbs are also directly induced by viral infections by similar, but probably not identical, mechanisms. In contrast to IFN\u03b1/\u03b2, IFN\u03bbs act only on specific cell types due to cell type-restricted expression of their specific receptor chain. The latter appears to be mainly expressed on epithelial cells and thus IFN\u03bbs have a more restricted/specific role in the antiviral defence (Commins et al. 2008).",

            "text": "Signalling of type I IFNs is initiated by ligand binding to a common heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of the IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 chains. Ligand binding results in the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) by the receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAKs) TYK2 and JAK1. Mainly STAT1\u2013STAT2 heterodimers, and to a lesser extent STAT1 homodimers, are activated in response to IFN\u03b1/\u03b2. Dependent on the cell type, other STAT family members can be activated, but their impact on cellular responses is often unclear. STAT1\u2013STAT2 heterodimers, in association with IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 9, form the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and induce transcription of genes containing IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) in their regulatory regions. Type III IFNs utilize the IL-10R2 and the IFN\u03bbR1 (IL-28R\u03b1) receptor chains and activate TYK2, JAK1 and mainly ISGF3. Accordingly, responses appear very similar to those induced by type I IFNs, although some differences have been reported. IFN\u03b3 binds to IFNGR1 and IFNGR2 and activates JAK1, JAK2 and mainly STAT1 homodimers. STAT1 homodimers bind to IFN\u03b3 activated sequences (GAS) in promoter regions of responsive genes. IFN\u03b3 can also activate other STAT complexes but again, the contribution of these complexes to the overall response requires further characterization. In general, IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 is mainly associated with antiviral and IFN\u03b3 with antibacterial activity, but IFN\u03b3 certainly also exhibits potent antiviral activity and IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 impacts on the antimicrobial defence. It is important to note that in addition to the induction of an antiviral state in responsive cells, IFNs also exert important immunomodulatory activities, mainly by shaping adaptive immune responses (Borden et al. 2007; Schindler et al. 2007).",

IFITM proteins have been found in proximity to the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), the Golgi apparatus, small vesicles, exosomes, or associated with the plasma membrane (Siegrist et al. 2011). They have been originally identified based on their IFN inducibility, although they are also expressed at low levels in untreated cells (Friedman et al. 1984). The antiviral potency of human IFITM1 (9\u201327, Ifi17, fragilis protein 2) has been first demonstrated by overexpression of IFITM1, which led to a marked decrease of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) but not influenza A virus (FLUAV) replication (Alber and Staeheli 1996). First mechanistic insights came from a quite recent study (Brass et al. 2009). Using viral pseudoparticles containing the murine leukaemia virus (MLV) genome and unique envelope proteins from different viruses, IFITM actions could be linked to viral surface proteins and to early steps in viral replication. Envelope proteins from several FLUAV strains, three different flaviviruses (i.e. West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OMSK)), and VSV could confer IFITM1-, IFITM2- and IFITM3-sensitivity to pseudovirus particles, whereas no effect was observed with envelope proteins from three different arenaviruses (i.e. Machupo virus (MACV), Lassa virus (LASV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)), or MLV. Consistent with the pseudovirus particles, overexpression of IFITM1, IFITM2 (fragilis protein 3, 1-8D) or IFITM3 (1-8U, Ifi15, fragilis protein) in human cell lines results in strongly reduced replication of FLUAV. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of IFITM3 enhances FLUAV replication and decreases IFN\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}\n$${{{\\alpha }}} $$\n\\end{document} or IFN\u03b3-mediated anti-FLUAV activity. The effect of IFITM3 on WNV and Dengue virus (DV) replication was confirmed with overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments. No effect was observed on hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, supporting the notion that IFITM actions are virus-specific (Brass et al. 2009). Further evidence for the inhibition of flavivirus and of rhabdovirus entry and/or uncoating by IFITM1-3 has been provided using stably transfected human cell lines (Jiang et al. 2010; Weidner et al. 2010). Very recently, the IFITM-mediated inhibition via viral entry proteins was extended to filoviruses (i.e. Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV)), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Huang et al. 2011), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 (Lu et al. 2011). Consistent with studies in human cells, increased FLUAV replication was observed in embryonic fibroblasts derived from mice lacking the entire Ifitm locus (Table 1) (Brass et al. 2009).\n",

Recent evidence suggests that the inhibition occurs at late stages of the endocytic pathway. IFITM proteins do not decrease the primary attachment moieties for FLUAV (Brass et al. 2009) and do not affect SARS-CoV receptor expression (Huang et al. 2011). FLUAV still localizes to lysosomal compartments upon ectopic expression of IFITM1, 2 or 3. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of IFITMs on SARS-CoV could be circumvented by addition of trypsin, which promotes fusion at or near the plasma membrane (Huang et al. 2011). There is also evidence for different specificities of IFITM family members. Among the murine IFITMs, IFITM3 inhibits FLUAV entry more efficiently than SARS-CoV, MARV, or EBOV, whereas IFITM5 and IFITM6 are more efficient in inhibiting filoviruses (Huang et al. 2011). Interestingly, IFITM3 is posttranslationally modified by S-palmitoylation. Mutation of the palmitoylation site does not alter protein stability or trafficking, but prevents membrane clustering and abrogates its antiviral effect on FLUAV replication (Yount et al. 2010). Although there is accumulating in vitro evidence for an important role of IFITM proteins in the early antiviral defence against a broad range of enveloped viruses, the contribution of IFITM proteins to the antiviral defence in vivo remains to be determined.",

            "text": "The Mx proteins are among the most potent antiviral effector proteins. The Mx family comprises Mx1 and Mx2 in mice, and MxA and MxB in humans. Mx proteins are 70\u201380 kDa in size, belong to the dynamin protein family and differ from the other IFN-inducible GTPases by their stronger induction by type I and type III IFNs as compared to IFN\u03b3. Mx1 localizes to the nucleus, whereas MxA and Mx2 are located near the smooth ER. MxB is found in the intranuclear and/or cytoplasmic face of nuclear pores and has no detectable antiviral activity. Mx1 was identified as an important IFN-induced antiviral factor in early studies with mice exhibiting a genetically determined resistance against FLUAV infection (Haller and Kochs 2011; Haller et al. 2007). Importantly, many laboratory inbred mouse strains, including C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ and 129/J, carry non-functional Mx1 alleles due to large deletions or nonsense mutations (Staeheli et al. 1988). Studies employing Mx1- and MxA-transgenic mice confirmed the importance of Mx proteins for the antiviral defence in vivo. For example, constitutive expression of MxA in Ifnar1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice confers full resistance to Thogoto virus (THOV), La Crosse virus (LACV) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) (Hefti et al. 1999). Mx proteins inhibit replication of a broad range of RNA viruses and some DNA viruses. The mechanism of Mx action has been extensively studied, but is still not entirely clear. Dependent on their localization Mx proteins can recognize and trap essential viral structures, the main targets appear to be viral nucleocapsids. Cytoplasmic MxA blocks the movement of FLUAV and THOV nucleocapsids into the nucleus, while nuclear Mx1 inhibits FLUAV replication prior to the onset of transcription. Mx1 and MxA associate with the viral nucleocapsids and block viral transcription. MxA-mediated changes in trafficking of viral components have also been shown for LACV and African swine fever virus (ASFV). Trapping of viral structures enables Mx proteins to inhibit viral replication already at early steps of infection and provides a very efficient antiviral strategy. It is unclear how exactly Mx proteins interact with viral constituents, but recent structural insights into the basis of Mx oligomerization might help to delineate the mechanism and molecular requirements. Besides, FLUAV strains appear to differ in their sensitivity to MxA actions and this appears to depend on their nucleoproteins (Haller and Kochs 2011; Haller et al. 2007). With respect to human populations, genetic polymorphisms in the MxA gene correlate with increased sensitivity to HCV, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and measles virus (MeV) (Cao et al. 2009; Hijikata et al. 2000; Suzuki et al. 2004; Torisu et al. 2004).",

Overexpression of human GBP1 and its putative murine homolog Gbp2 inhibits VSV and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) replication.

Among the three mammalian ADARs (ADAR1-3) described to date, only ADAR1 is IFN-inducible through an ISRE element in one of the alternative ADAR1 gene promoters. In mice and humans, alternative splicing leads to the expression of the constitutively expressed p110 and the IFN-inducible p150 isoforms. ADAR1 p150 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, ADAR1 p110 is predominantly and ADAR2 and ADAR3 are exclusively found in the nucleus. ADAR3 lacks catalytic activity, shows tissue-restricted expression and has been implicated in negative regulation of ADAR1 and ADAR2. RNA editing by ADAR1 can occur at multiple positions or at highly specific sites. Multiple A-to-G substitutions attributable to ADAR activity have been first described for MeV, followed by a large number of other viruses that mostly contain a negative-stranded RNA or an ambisense genome organization. More site-selective A-to-G exchanges have been reported for example for hepatitis delta virus (HDV), human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) and Epstein-Barr (EBV) virus (Samuel 2011).",

A-to-I editing of viral RNAs can affect virus-host interactions at multiple levels and, importantly, can also have proviral effects. Nucleotide exchanges can lead to amino acid exchanges and altered protein products with different biological activities. This has for example been described for MeV, where extensive hypermutation of the matrix protein is associated with persistent infection of the central nervous system. A-to-I editing can also lead to frame-shift mutations or premature stop-codons and, consequently, to aberrant or reduced viral protein expression, as described for MeV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and LCMV (Samuel 2011). A-to-I conversion can also induce structural changes in RNAs, as RNA duplex structures are less stable when A:uridine (U) base pairs are exchanged by I:U base pairs (Bass 2002; Serra et al. 2004). Reduced duplex-stability likely results in altered dsRNA-mediated activities. In support of this notion, shRNA-mediated downregulation of ADAR1 leads to enhanced activation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) and IRF3 (Toth et al. 2009). Consistently, synthetic I:U-containing RNAs suppress dsRNA-mediated activation of IRF3 and ISG expression in HeLa cells (Vitali and Scadden 2010). A-to-I substitutions can also alter microRNA processing or silencing capacity, or target RNAs for degradation. These effects have been shown for cellular RNAs and are yet to be demonstrated for viral RNAs. It is also likely that RNA editing can lead to viral genome mutations in the case of single-stranded (ss) RNA viruses that use RNA-dependent RNA replication. Furthermore, RNA editing might also indirectly influence virus replication as it could affect cellular transcripts of proteins involved in the antiviral defence (Samuel 2011).",

Thus, ADAR1 and ADAR2 are also crucially involved in cellular processes unrelated to host defence mechanisms. Nevertheless, studies with embryonic fibroblasts derived from these mice clearly established the selective functions of ADAR1 and ADAR2 in editing viral RNAs and in antiviral pathways. Adar1(p150)\n\u2212/\u2212 cells ectopically expressing the receptor for MeV show dramatically increased MeV-induced cytopathic effects and markedly increased virus replication (Ward et al. 2011). This is consistent with the reported increased MeV-induced cytotoxicity in HeLa cells after shRNA-mediated ADAR1 knockdown (Toth et al. 2009). Similarly, other members of the Paramyxoviridae (i.e. Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Sendai virus (SeV), canine distemper virus (CDV)) and FLUAV induce less pronounced cytopathic effects in Adar1(p150)\n\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts than in the respective wildtype cells. No effect of Adar1(p150) deficiency was found for LCMV and VSV replication (Ward et al. 2011).",

For VSV this has been attributed to the interaction of ADAR1 with PKR, inhibition of PKR activity and consequent impairment of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) phosphorylation (Nie et al. 2007). The proviral effect of ADAR1 for HDV is well established. HDV requires site-specific A-to-I editing to switch from the short delta antigen protein, which is essential during early steps of replication, to the longer form, which is crucial for packaging of the viral genome and HDV particle formation (Samuel 2011). Inhibition of HDV occurs upon increased HDV RNA editing conditions, such as overexpression of ADAR1(p110) or ADAR2, or by IFN-mediated increased ADAR1(p150) expression (Hartwig et al. 2004; Jayan and Casey 2002). Proviral mechanisms in the case of HIV-1, KSHV and MPV are less well characterized, but they might involve site-specific editing of viral mRNA and the switch from early to late transcripts, respectively, for the latter two viruses (Samuel 2011).",

            "text": "Most human APOBEC3 family members are expressed constitutively and expression is further enhanced by IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3 (Goila-Gaur and Strebel 2008; Koning et al. 2009; Refsland et al. 2010; Stenglein et al. 2010; Trapp et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2009). APOBEC3 proteins are packaged into retroviral particles and cause extensive C-to-U mutations in the minus-strand of the viral DNA during reverse transcription. C-to-U editing can lead to mutations in viral structural and non-structural proteins causing replication defects at multiple levels. Degradation of uracilated viral cDNAs by cellular DNA glycosylases is believed to contribute to the APOBEC3-mediated antiviral activity (Goila-Gaur and Strebel 2008). Intriguingly, a very recent report implicates APOBEC3A catalytic activity and the cellular uracil DNA glycosylase UNG2 in the clearance of transfected plasmid DNAs, suggesting that APOBEC3s may act as a restriction factor for a broader range of foreign DNAs (Stenglein et al. 2010). In addition, APOBEC3s exert deaminase-independent antiviral functions and these include interference with tRNA-primed initiation of reverse transcription and reverse transcriptase-mediated DNA elongation (Goila-Gaur and Strebel 2008; Narvaiza et al. 2009). Apart from retroviruses, APOBEC3s can also interfere with the HBV life cycle, however, APOBEC3B, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G are not required for the anti-HBV actions of IFN\u03b3 in human cell lines (Goila-Gaur and Strebel 2008; Proto et al. 2008). In contrast, several reports suggest a contribution of APOBEC3s to the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2-induced antiviral activity against HIV-1 (Cheney and McKnight 2010; Goila-Gaur and Strebel 2008; Trapp et al. 2009).",

Murine APOBEC3 also induces hypermutations in retroviral cDNAs, but restriction of its activity to specific viruses appears different from the human APOBEC3G (Browne and Littman 2008; Rulli et al. 2008). Murine Apobec3 has been implicated in the in vivo control of Friend-murine leukaemia virus (FMLV) (Santiago et al. 2011; Takeda et al. 2008) and Apobec3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice show increased sensitivity to mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) (Okeoma et al. 2007, 2009b). Apobec3\n\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with Moloney murine leukaemia virus (M-MuLV) show higher virus titers and develop earlier leukaemia in comparison to control animals (Low et al. 2009). Importantly, pre-treatment of murine cells with IFN\u03b1 results in enhanced Apobec3 expression and resistance against MMTV. No effect of IFN\u03b1 on MMTV replication was observed in Apobec3\n\u2212/\u2212 cells, demonstrating that Apobec3 crucially contributes to the anti-MMTV action of IFNs (Okeoma et al. 2009b). Consistent with data from the human system, dsRNA pretreatment inhibits HBV DNA production in HBV-transgenic and Apobec3-deficient mice to similar levels as in the control HBV-transgenic mice (Turelli et al. 2008) (Table 1).",

OAS1 proteins contain one unit of the OAS domain, OAS2 and OAS3 contain two and three copies of the catalytic units, respectively. Among the murine OAS1 proteins, only OAS1a and OAS1g are catalytically active. OASL proteins contain one OAS unit which is, with the exception of murine OASL2, without catalytic activity (Kristiansen et al. 2011). Mice and humans harbour one RNase L gene, which is widely expressed in most, if not all mammalian tissues and further upregulated by type I IFN exposure in murine cells, but only barely in human cells.

Therefore, OASs are not only antiviral proteins but also considered as PRRs. Activated OAS polymerizes ATP into 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylates (2-5An). Binding of these oligomers to the ankyrin domain of monomeric RNase L leads to dimerization and activation of RNase L. Subsequently, the endoribonuclease degrades viral and cellular RNAs with ssRNA loops and thus prevents viral protein synthesis (Fig. 2). Each of the active human OAS family members appears to have some unique biological features. For example, catalytically active OAS1 is a monomer or tetramer, OAS2 a dimer and OAS3 functions as a monomer. OAS3 synthesizes dimeric 2-5An, whereas OAS1 and OAS2 synthesize trimeric and tetrameric oligomers. As dimeric 2-5An do not efficiently activate RNase L, OAS3 might have different functions. Several overexpression studies demonstrated antiviral capacity for human OAS family members. OAS1 and OAS2 inhibit replication of EMCV, but not VSV, OAS3 is effective against alphaviruses, i.e. SFV and Sinbis virus (SINV) (Chakrabarti et al. 2011; Kristiansen et al. 2011; Sadler and Williams 2008). Little is known about the characteristics of dsRNA recognition and activation of OAS family members. Human OAS1 appears to also bind ssRNA, but activation only occurs upon dsRNA binding, with a preference for longer dsRNAs (Kristiansen et al. 2011). There also might be differential specificities in dsRNA recognition among OAS family members, as recently suggested for murine OAS1a and OAS1b (Elbahesh et al. 2011).\n",

The 3\u2032-phosphate of RNase L cleavage products appears to be required at least for the activation of RIG-I (Luthra et al. 2011; Malathi et al. 2007, 2010). Knockout mice for RNase L are susceptible to EMCV, CV-B4, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and WNV (Table 1), although the RNase L-specific effects seem to be strongly dependent on the cell type and the virus strain. Several reports showed that RNase L can also negatively influence host survival upon virus infection and promote viral replication as shown for HSV-2, SINV, SFV and some reovirus strains (Silverman 2007). On the other hand, RNase L appears to be protective against virus-induced demyelination. Infection of RNase L\n\u2212/\u2212 mice with the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-JHM strain results in higher susceptibility, but does neither affect virus control in the CNS nor IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 expression (Ireland et al. 2009).",

Dependent on the mouse strain, the OAS1b protein exists in two forms, a full-length OAS1b and a truncated form as a result of a point mutation in the OAS1b gene generating a premature stop codon. Only the full-length protein leads to resistance against WNV infection. Notably, most laboratory inbred mouse strains express the truncated version of OAS1b (Kristiansen et al. 2011).

PKR is encoded by the Eif2ak2 gene and is one out of four members of a serine-threonine kinase family that regulates protein synthesis upon diverse stress signals mainly through phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. PKR consists of two N-terminal RNA binding motifs (RBMs) and a C-terminal catalytic kinase domain (KD). PKR is constitutively expressed in all differentiated cells at low levels and is upregulated upon type I and III IFN through activation of an ISRE binding site in the promoter. In uninfected cells, PKR exists as an inactive monomer by autoinhibition of the kinase domain. DsRNA and other ligands like heparin, ceramide and the PKR-associated factor PACT induce the release of the inactive molecule and lead to autophosphorylation and dimerization of PKR. Activation of PKR can also occur through binding of ssRNA containing duplex regions and a 5\u2032-triphosphate. Interestingly, endogenous transcripts also efficiently activate PKR, as known for the IFN\u03b3 mRNA. Once PKR is activated, it phosphorylates the serine residue 51 of eIF2\u03b1 leading to inhibition of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2\u03b2. This prevents exchange of GDP to GTP, thus blocking translation initiation (Fig. 3). Intriguingly, PKR regulates its own activity through inhibition of its mRNA translation initiation in the presence of high PKR protein levels (Pindel and Sadler 2011; Sadler 2010).\n",

            "text": "Although phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and consequent translational regulation was considered as the major function of PKR, several reports have suggested involvement of PKR in different signalling networks. For example, PKR has been shown to regulate the transcription factors IRF1, STAT1, STAT3, nuclear factor NF\u03baB, c-Jun, cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor (ATF) 3 and ATF4 (Pindel and Sadler 2011). Two recent reports suggest that PKR is an important regulator of IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 synthesis/secretion. This has been shown in response to infection with a subset of RNA viruses, like EMCV, SFV and Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). Mechanistically, absence of PKR results in strongly reduced levels of polyadenylated IFN\u03b2 mRNAs. Thus, PKR maintains the integrity of IFN\u03b2 mRNA thereby promoting its translation. PKR action in this case seems to be independent of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Consistently, serum levels of IFN\u03b2 are reduced in EMCV infected Pkr\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Schulz et al. 2010). These data were supported by a later study with in vitro bovine rotavirus (BRV) infections. Virus infection leads to a strong RIG-I-, MDA5- and IRF3-dependent IFN\u03b2 mRNA induction. IFN\u03b2 mRNA levels are normal in fibroblasts derived from Pkr\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, but IFN\u03b2 protein secretion is dramatically reduced (Sen et al. 2011). It is unclear, how PKR prevents mRNA de-adenylation and whether other mRNAs are similarly regulated by PKR-dependent stabilizing mechanism.",

Increased survival rates are found in neonatal mice after subcutaneous inoculation with SINV RNA encoding Isg20 as compared to the respective controls (Zhou et al. 2011).

The studies outlined above show a requirement for its exoribonuclease activity, thus it seems likely that ISG20 directly degrades viral RNA and/or DNA, however, evidence remains to be provided. ISG20 does not degrade transfected replication-incompetent HCV RNA, suggesting that either viral RNA associated with replication complexes or replication intermediates are targets for ISG20-mediated degradation. It is notable in that context, that ISG20 specifically degrades ssRNA but not RNA containing stem-loop structures at the 3\u2032-end (Nguyen et al. 2001). Alternatively, ISG20 might act indirectly by e.g. targeting other (cellular) factors that are required for viral replication. The contribution of endogenous ISG20 to IFN-induced antiviral activity and its role in the in vivo defence against specific viruses needs further delineation.",

IFIT1 (ISG56) and IFIT2 (ISG54) have well established inhibitory effects on protein synthesis by targeting the translation initiation complex. Although this globally affects protein synthesis, IFIT1 might more specifically block translation of viral RNAs.

Only very recently, extensive analyses including gene-targeted mice and mutant viruses established that the antiviral functions of IFITs depend on the 5\u2032-structures of viral RNAs (Daffis et al. 2010; Pichlmair et al. 2011). In higher eukaryotes, 2\u2032-O-methylation of cellular mRNA 5\u2032-caps occurs, in addition to the well-known essential methylation at the N-7 position of the cap guanosine residue, at the ribose-2\u2032-O-position of one or two adjoining nucleotides (Langberg and Moss 1981). Several RNA and DNA viruses also have 2\u2032-O-methylated 5\u2032-capped mRNAs (Fechter and Brownlee 2005; Wei and Moss 1975) and mutant WNV, MHV and vaccinia (VACV) viruses lacking their respective 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity are sensitive to IFIT1 and/or IFIT2 actions (Table 1) (Daffis et al. 2010; Zust et al. 2011). A mechanistic explanation for the 5\u2032-nucleic acid structure-specific IFIT functions came from the finding that IFITs can form multi-protein complexes that bind to \u201cnon-self\u201d 5\u2032-triphosphorylated RNA (PPP-RNA) in human cell lines (Pichlmair et al. 2011). IFIT1 and IFIT5 (ISG58), the latter existing in humans but not in mice, directly bind to PPP-RNA, whereas IFIT2 and IFIT3 (ISG60) can associate with PPP-RNA through interaction with IFIT1. Consistently, siRNA mediated downregulation of IFIT1 inhibits replication of VSV and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), both viruses known to generate PPP-mRNAs, and Ifit1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice and fibroblasts show increased sensitivity to VSV infection (Table 1). Proofing the specificity of IFIT1 action, absence of IFIT1 does not affect replication of EMCV, a virus that does not generate PPP-mRNA. Interestingly, sequestration of viral mRNA rather than direct inhibition of translational initiation appeared as the main antiviral effector function in this study, although the fate of the bound viral RNA remained undefined (Pichlmair et al. 2011).",

            "text": "ISG15 is among the most prominently induced genes during virus infection and in response to type I IFNs. ISG15 is an ubiquitin-like protein that is conjugated to target proteins. The so-called ISGylation of proteins has many common features with protein-ubiquitination. Both involve a series of stepwise enzymatic reactions that result in covalent protein modifications (Fig. 4). ISG15 is synthesised as a precursor protein that is processed to expose a C-terminal LRLRGG motif. The GG motif is adenylated in the presence of ATP and then conjugated sequentially to cystein residues of three enzymes (E1\u2013E3) and, finally, ISG15 is transferred to lysine residues within its target substrates. The E1 enzyme (ISG15-activating enzyme, UBE1L) is specific for the ISGylation pathway, whereas there is an overlap with enzymes involved in ubiquitination for the E2 (ISG15/ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) and E3 (ISG15/ubiquitin ligase) enzymes. Both ubiquitination and ISGylation are reversible processes and several de-ubiquitinating and de-ISGylating enzymes can cleave off the respective protein modification. Similar to ISG15, many enzymes involved in the ISGylation pathway are induced by IFNs, e.g. the E1 enzyme UBE1L, the E2 enzyme UBCH8, the E3 enzymes HERC5 and tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25), and the de-ISGylating enzyme UBP43 (USP18) (Harty et al. 2009; Zhang and Zhang 2011).\n",

            "text": "Unlike ubiquitination, ISGylation does not target proteins for degradation but rather resembles mono-ubiqitination and mainly affects protein function. ISGylation can also increase protein stability by protecting proteins from degradation. ISGylation has a very broad specificity and over 150 putative cellular ISG15 target proteins have been identified so far. ISG15 has a broad antiviral activity against both DNA and RNA viruses. Isg15\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are highly susceptible to FLUAV and influenza B virus (FLUBV), SINV, HSV, and murine \u03b3-herpesvirus 68 (\u03b3MHV68) infections (Harty et al. 2009). Consistent with the involvement of ISGylation, Ube1l\n\u2212/\u2212 mice show increased susceptibility to FLUBV and SINV infection. In contrast, ISG15 and UBE1L are redundant for the in vivo defence against LCMV (see also Table 1). Very recently, the FLUAV NS1A protein was identified as ISG15 target protein in two independent studies (Tang et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2010). FLUAV NS1A protein was shown to directly interact with the major human E3 ISG15 ligase HERC5. Overexpression of HERC5 in human cell lines enhances the anti-FLUAV activity of IFN\u03b2 and, consistently, downregulation of ISG15, UBE1L, UBCH8 or HERC5 by siRNA increases viral protein synthesis and replication (Hsiang et al. 2009; Tang et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2010). Multiple lysine (K) residues within the NS1A can be modified by ISGylation (Tang et al. 2010; Zhao et al. 2010). In vitro ISGylated NS1A is unable to bind to PKR and to dsRNA and fails to dimerize via its RNA-binding domains (Zhao et al. 2010). ISGylated truncated NS1A protein, lacking its second C-terminal nuclear-localization signal, shows impaired interaction with importin-\u03b1 (Tang et al. 2010). Although the major ISGylated lysine residues identified within the NS1A protein differ among the two studies, FLUAV expressing NS1A mutant for specific lysine residue are more virulent in vivo (Tang et al. 2010) or show enhanced replication in IFN\u03b2 treated cell lines, respectively (Zhao et al. 2010).",

ISGylation of these target proteins can have diverse effects, whereby it generally results in increased antiviral activity. For example, ISGylation has been reported to prevent NDV-induced degradation of IRF3 resulting in enhanced IFN\u03b2 production in human fibrosarcoma cells (Lu et al. 2006). This notion was confirmed by a later study showing direct interaction of IRF3 with HERC5 in HEK293 cells (Shi et al. 2010). Ectopic expression of HERC5 potentiates IRF3 transcriptional activity and siRNA-mediated downregulation of HERC5 or ISG15 reduces the expression of IRF3-responsive genes upon SeV infection. Notably, a HERC5 mutant protein that lacks its ligase activity does not affect IRF3 target gene-activation. Downregulation of HERC5 by siRNA results in increased replication of SeV, VSV and NDV. SeV-induced IRF3 poly-ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation is reduced upon ectopic expression of the ISGylation system. IRF3 was shown to be ISGylated predominantly at three lysine residues and, as expected, the triple lysine mutant does not show a change in ubiquitination upon HERC5 downregulation and SeV infection. Furthermore, the triple lysine IRF3 mutant cannot fully rescue IFN\u03b2 reporter gene activation in response to SeV infection in Irf3\n\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryo fibroblasts and displays accelerated degradation in comparison to wildtype IRF3 (Shi et al. 2010).",

ISGylation of cellular proteins has been recently also shown to be responsible for the inhibition of early steps of the FLUAV replication cycle (Hsiang et al. 2009), although proteins involved remained undefined. Negative regulation by ISGylation has been shown for RIG-I. ISGylation of RIG-I leads to reduced basal and virus-induced IFN production and cells derived from Ube1l-deficient mice show significantly lower levels of RIG-I mRNA and protein. Thus, a negative feedback mechanism acting on RIG-I was postulated which might be required to balance cellular innate immune responses (Kim et al. 2008b).",

Ubp43\n\u2212/\u2212 mice show increased resistance against LCMV and VSV and display strongly increased clearance of injected replication competent HBV DNA (Table 1). However, Ubp43\n\u2212/\u2212 mice develop brain injury, accompanied by hydrocephalus and early death and thus in vivo virus challenges have their limitations (Knobeloch et al. 2005; Ritchie et al. 2002, 2004). Fibroblasts derived from Ubp43\n\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit enhanced type I IFN-mediated protection from cytopathic effects caused by VSV and SINV infection (Ritchie et al. 2004). Ubp43\n\u2212/\u2212 cells show dramatically increased levels of ISGylated proteins after IFN treatment which is also associated with increased JAK/STAT signalling and hyper-responsiveness to type I IFN (Malakhova et al. 2003). Curiously, the phenotype of Ubp43\n\u2212/\u2212 cells is not rescued in fibroblasts derived from Ubp43\n\u2212/\u2212\n/Isg15\n\u2212/\u2212 or Ubp43\n\u2212/\u2212\n/Ube1l\n\u2212/\u2212 double knockout mice (Kim et al. 2006; Knobeloch et al. 2005), suggesting that the IFN hyper-responsiveness and the virus-resistant phenotype of Ubp43\n\u2212/\u2212 cells is not associated with de-ISGylating activity. A possible explanation is provided by studies demonstrating that UBP43 also negatively regulates type I IFN signalling (Malakhova et al. 2003, 2006). UBP43 was shown to directly interact with IFNAR2 and, consequently, inhibit JAK/STAT signalling. This effect is independent of UBP43 isopeptidase activity as complementation of Ubp43\n\u2212/\u2212 cells with an enzymatically inactive mutant UBP43 inhibits IFN-induced STAT1 phosphorylation to similar levels as observed in wildtype cells (Malakhova et al. 2006). In line with this, STAT1 phosphorylation is barely affected despite the downregulation of total ISGylation levels in fibroblasts derived from Ube1l\n\u2212/\u2212 mice (Kim et al. 2006).",

The former study defined viperin as an ER-associated protein with anti-HCMV activity in human fibroblasts. Antiviral activity of viperin was subsequently shown for HCV (Helbig et al. 2005; Jiang et al. 2008), HIV-1 (Rivieccio et al. 2006), FLUAV (Wang et al. 2007), SINV (Zhang et al. 2007), WNV and DV (Jiang et al. 2010). Concerning the mechanism of action, detailed studies are only available for FLUAV infections (Wang et al. 2007). Viperin strongly impairs FLUAV release and, consequently, reduces virus replication in stably transfected HeLa cells. The authors demonstrate that inhibition of virus release occurs via disruption of plasma membrane lipid rafts. Viperin expression results in higher fluidity of membranes and, correspondingly, in an increased mobility of the viral haemagglutinin protein. No effect of viperin was observed in the course of VSV infection, a virus whose replication is believed to be lipid raft-independent. Additionally, farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) was identified as viperin-interacting protein and overexpression of FPPS reversed the effects of viperin on FLUAV replication. Consistently, siRNA-mediated knockdown of FPPS reduces virus release. Thus viperin exerts antiviral activity by sequestering FPPS to the ER and inhibiting its enzymatic activity (Wang et al. 2007). FPPS has important roles in isoprenoid biosynthesis by catalyzing the formation of farnesyl diphosphate, the precursor of sterols, dolichols, carotenoids, and ubiquinones (Szkopinska and Plochocka 2005). It remains to be determined which of the FPPS-regulated pathways is essentially involved in facilitating viral release.",

It is unclear if relocation of viperin is beneficial or detrimental for viral replication.

HIV-1 requires its Vpu gene product for virus release in a cell type-specificmanner. BST-2 has been identified as a virus restriction factor by its ability to induce a Vpu-restricted phenotype in cells that otherwise show Vpu-independent HIV-1 release (Andrew and Strebel 2011). BST-2 was also found to inhibit virus release of all retroviruses tested, but also of arenavirus (i.e. LASV), filovirus (i.e. EBOV, MARV) and rhabdovirus (i.e. VSV) family members (Jouvenet et al. 2009; Sakuma et al. 2009; Weidner et al. 2010). The exact mechanism of how BST-2 inhibits virus release is still unclear, but BST-2 tethers virions to the producer cell. BST-2 might contribute to IFN-mediated antiviral activity against a wider range of enveloped viruses that bud from the host cell plasma membrane, however, this remains to be shown. On the other hand, BST-2 might also be proviral in the sense that it enables a shift of the mode of viral transmission, i.e. cell-to-cell versus cell-free spread (Andrew and Strebel 2011).",

The RING domain of many TRIM proteins has an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, whereas the other two domains may be involved in mediating protein-protein interactions. TRIM proteins form high-molecular-mass complexes and localize to specific subcellular compartments either in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. TRIM proteins are involved in diverse cellular processes like cell growth, apoptosis and innate immunity (Ozato et al. 2008). The TRIM family consists of 72 genes in humans, whereby 16 TRIM genes are induced by type I and/or type II IFN (Carthagena et al. 2009). Among the TRIM proteins, TRIM5, TRIM19 and TRIM22 are strongest upregulated by type I and type II IFN. No homologs of TRIM5 and TRIM22 have been found in mice (Carthagena et al. 2009). Several members have reported antiviral activity that is exerted at multiple levels (Kajaste-Rudnitski et al. 2010), but their contribution to the IFN-mediated antiviral response is largely unknown.",

            "text": "TRIM19, better known as promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) protein, is a constitutive component of PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs), which are small nuclear sub-structures. PML, Sp100 and small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) are constitutively present in PML NBs and many other proteins are transiently or permanently associated with PML NBs. PML NBs are potentially highly dynamic and the proteins associated can vary between cell types. PML is expressed constitutively, but type I and type II IFNs lead to a strong increase in the size and number of PML NBs. PML exists as many different isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing and grouped into seven classes (PML I-VII). PML isoforms likely have different functions, which still remain to be defined. In addition, Sp100, Daxx and other PML NB proteins are IFN-inducible. PML NBs are involved in the regulation of chromatin structure, transcription and DNA repair, unfolded protein responses and, in the regulation of apoptosis. Since PML NBs are constitutively present, numerous reports described their contribution to the intrinsic antiviral defence against a broad range of DNA and RNA viruses. The exact mechanisms of viral inhibition are still largely unknown, but they involve inhibition of viral mRNA and protein synthesis (Geoffroy and Chelbi-Alix 2011). Despite the constitutive expression of PML NB constituents, the IFN-mediated induction of PML and Sp100 has in several cases been linked to the antiviral function of PML NBs. For example, the IFN-mediated antiviral effect against an HSV-1 ICP10 mutant virus that lacks the ability to disrupt PML NBs was strongly reduced in Pml\n\u2212/\u2212 cells (Chee et al. 2003). Reduced IFN-induced protection against LCMV (Djavani et al. 2001), human foamy virus (HFV) (Regad et al. 2001) and rabies virus (RV) (Blondel et al. 2010) was reported in Pml\n\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts and Pml\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible to LCMV and VSV infection (Table 1) (Bonilla et al. 2002).",

            "text": "The complexity of host-virus interactions remains a challenging field for future research on innate immune responses. While specificity and molecular mechanisms of viral recognition are important issues, further characterization of antiviral functions of specific ISGs seems equally essential. Many studies have so far only been performed in vitro and/or in overexpression studies and it will be of particular interest how these ISGs impact on antiviral responses under physiological conditions and in vivo. This might not be trivial, as there is most likely a high redundancy of pathways and ISGs can affect viral life cycles at multiple levels. Moreover, several ISGs also exert important, but not fully characterized, cellular functions. Genome-wide association studies in human populations provide another important ongoing future direction. Genetic polymorphisms in any of the ISG loci might reveal association with virus susceptibility or other potential novel immune regulatory functions. Besides, a lot of information has been gained by studies of virus mutants. Viruses have evolved very efficient mechanisms to counteract the host immune system and further analysis from this perspective will help to decipher the multiple levels of virus-host interactions. The more detailed understanding of the exact interplay between viral and cellular factors might help to better control virus infections and to more specifically direct antiviral responses.\n",

Viruses use substantially different replication strategies and we therefore use the life cycle of an enveloped (\u2212)ssRNA virus as an example (depicted in blue letters). The virus binds to its cellular receptor at the plasma membrane, enters the cell via pH-dependent endocytosis and fusion, subsequently uncoated viral nucleoproteins are transported to the nucleus, where virus replication and transcription occurs. Viral proteins are translated by the cellular machinery, core proteins assemble with the viral genome, envelope proteins are transported via the ER/Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane where virus assembly and budding occurs. ISG-encoded proteins targeting different steps during viral replication are depicted in pink letters. ISG products can either inhibit certain steps (\u22a5), modify/degrade viral products (\u2193), or act via unknown/putative mechanisms (?).
