A retrospective analysis of individual case data from China and elsewhere showed a very strong age gradient in the infection fatality ratio (IFR) and case fatality ratio (CFR) [2] . In France, as at 15 March 2020, people older than 75 years accounted for 20% of the confirmed cases but 79% of the deaths [3] . Cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the comorbidities most frequently associated with COVID-19, and many patients died of their original comorbidities [4, 5] . All these comorbidities are highly common among dependent elderly people housed in institutions. Using simple calculation, we present here the impact of several worst-case scenarios in French institutions.",

In France, at the end of 2017, 766,400 people above 60 years of age were housed in retirement homes for dependent elderly people, in long-term care facilities or received home-based care [6] . While the calculation of IFR is based on the proportion of all infected cases, i.e. a precise estimation of the proportion of symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, we restricted our analysis to CFR. The CFR, estimated from China and elsewhere, for 60-69 year-olds, 70-79 yearolds and those 80 years and older were, respectively, 3.6%, 8.0% and 14.8% [2] . We applied the hypothesis that 30-50% of the institutions were infected, a final attack rate (AR) of 30-50% among the residents and applying age-specific fatality ratios, with their confidence intervals (CI), from [2] . By the time the epidemic is over, the resulting death toll in these institutions could be equal to the yearly national death toll caused by seasonal influenza in those older than above 65 years (9,025 deaths on average between 2000 and 2009) or it could largely exceed that figure, depending on the final AR and the proportion of infected institutions (Table) [7] . Among this frail population, part of this excess in mortality may be due to the acceleration of underlying unavoidable process and another part directly attributable to the infection.",

Social isolation will in turn increase the risk of cognitive disorders and further delay diagnosis [16] . Close contacts between residents and nursing staff and frequent contacts within nursing staff, lead to a high probability of infection among the nursing staff. As a consequence, the institution needs to hire temporary staff and organise rotations during a long period of heavy workload. The institutions then need to cope with a double burden: a high burden of disease among residents and severe staff constraints.",
