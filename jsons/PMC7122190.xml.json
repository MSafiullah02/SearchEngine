            "text": "With the advent of technological advancements, the rising scientific era witnessed the emergence of infectious diseases. This led to a sharp increase in global mortality and morbidity rate. Hence the research community held up the war against these pathogens by investigating deep into their molecular mechanisms, their host\u2013pathogen interaction, and their epidemiology for the discovery of fine effective antimicrobial measures for host survival and safety. The researchers treated the pathogenic ailments with useful inventions for long-term medication. Drug generally implies to foreign elements or agents that have some medicinal properties for common therapeutic usage. They can be used for bacterial infections, even as antifungal or antiparasitic agents, for cancer treatments, etc. The discovery of antibiotics was the greatest medical intervention affecting human survivability and health regime (Chain 1979; Fleming 1944; Dougherty and Pucci 2011; Ligon 2004). However indiscriminate usage had dramatically introduced new biological problems that are hard to confront with the present-day scientific solutions. Hence failure of medications did set the dawn of a post-antimicrobial era. The time of the Second World War had limited access to these expensive, rare, systemic medications (sulfonamides, penicillin, etc.). With time, simplified production of formulations eased the use of such treatments. Gradually, these antimicrobial agents mostly antibiotics became the elixir for the ailments from time then (Dougherty and Pucci 2011). Moreover the discoverer of penicillin Sir Alexander Fleming warned the surfacing of resistant forms of Staphylococcus aureus due to improper penicillin usage which would cause serious host complications (Hartman and Tomasz 1984). Few years later resistant forms emerged with 50 % of susceptible strains becoming resistant to the drug. Similar trend was observed in many other microbial species switching their drug sensitivity approach to a severe resistance mechanism thereby affecting healthy non-vulnerable population. This section will discuss in detail the emergence of drug-resistant microbial populations and the factors that govern their drug-resistant feature. The major focus of this segment will highlight the molecular, cellular, clinical, and genetic factors that bring about this severe cause of drug resistance. Beginning from the natural microbial resistance to the evolutionary alteration in the pathogen\u2019s genome, this chapter will cover the idea of how dealing with the conventional drug resistance mechanisms in the twenty-first century will create new frontiers for innovative therapeutic development. The problems and the complex challenge of dealing the multidrug resistance (MDR) mechanism at the molecular level will enable strategies for futuristic drug development for combating fungal, bacterial, and viral resistance mechanism.",

            "text": "The emergence of drug resistance has always been a major concern worldwide right after the introduction of drugs for common use. The crucial role of microbes in causing diseases led to the discovery of antimicrobial drugs (Davies and Davies 2010). Penicillin was the first of its kind as mentioned before to be introduced by Alexander Fleming in 1928 (Fleming 1944). Its effectiveness was against the Gram-positive bacteria, especially Staphylococcus aureus followed by few more antibiotics including streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, macrolides, nalidixic acid, etc. (J. T. Park and Stromistger 1957). However, different drug-resistant microorganisms also started to show up with due time course. In the 1950s, penicillinase-producing S. aureus found its way to the society resulting in the gradual emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant S. aureus. To combat the harmful effects of penicillinase-producing S. aureus, methicillin was developed, but to utter disappointment, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) thwarted mankind in the UK (Brumfitt and Hamilton-Miller 1989; Klevens et al. 2007). Meanwhile, ampicillin and piperacillin were produced as broad-spectrum antibiotics, which also proved to be effective against Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. In the 1960s, a new genre of drugs named cephems was designed and widely used (Bryskier 2000). With time, different generations of cephems were developed according to their antimicrobial spectra. But simultaneously, there was emergence of penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (PISP) in the latter half of 1967 and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP) in the 1970s. Frequent use of cephems was believed to be responsible for the increase of PRSP. Ampicillin, which was earlier effective against Haemophilus influenzae, failed in the 1980s, when the strains gained resistance against antibiotic by producing \u03b2-lactamase (Rubin et al. 1981). In the 1990s, \u03b2-lactamase-producing strains reduced in Japan, but highly resistant \u03b2-lactam strains increased in number through mutations in their PBP (penicillin-binding protein) genes. Such were named \u03b2-lactam-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) strains which were more common in Japan than in other parts of the world. In the latter half of the 1990s, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) was reported in the USA, which was thought to acquire the antibiotic resistance gene from vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) via horizontal gene transfer (Goldrick 2002; Sung and Lindsay 2007). In the early twenty-first century, the increased use of third-generation cephems and carbapenem, quinolones gave rise to increased risk of resistant Gonococci, multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa (MDRP), and quinolone-resistant E. coli. A relatively new concern in this field is the multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis. According to 2013 reports, out of all TB cases worldwide, approximately 5 % were estimated to be MDR-TB where the bacterium is resistant to minimum two of the most powerful first-line anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin (Klopper et al. 2013). When MDR-TB becomes resistant to at least one drug from each group of second-line anti-TB drugs like fluoroquinolones and other injectable drugs, it\u2019s defined as XDR-TB. Apart from resistance in microbes, resistance to chemotherapy by cancer cells emerged to be a major concern in cancer research.",

            "text": "Antibiotic resistance is a serious global issue that has seized the roots of development. Antimicrobial resistance affects host immune profile, modulates with pathogen\u2019s fitness cost, and influences the genetic co-selection of resistant species with their frequency of reversibility potential (Andersson and Hughes 2010). The biologic mechanisms of the microbe are mostly responsible for such a resistant feature to fight the environmental toxic conditions. The inherent property of the pathogen, i.e., the natural resistance of the microbe, is a reason of resistance emergence. The major causative factor of resistance development is also the frequency of appearance of resistant bacteria due to genetic mutations or evolutionary horizontal gene transfer (Dzidic and Bedekovi\u0107 2003; Thomas and Nielsen 2005). These mutations can modulate with the pathogen\u2019s drug uptake and efflux ability along with target alteration. Secondly the exposure of the pathogen to the drug/therapeutic influences the screening of resistant strains. The drug pharmacokinetic properties which affect pathogen\u2019s sustenance and clearance directly measure the degree of resistance mechanism. Human microflora is a hub of microbes and the release or exposure of wide-spectrum antibiotics can trigger resistant microbes to flourish and spread their tentacles of tolerance. Antibacterial agents mostly target bacterial cell wall synthesis, protein synthetic machinery, DNA duplication, and repair processes or transcriptional regulatory processes. Thereby the resistant mutants lack biological fitness. Hence, the natural selection theory suggests less prevalence of antibiotics to decrease the emergence of resistant species. Even the frequency with which the genetic alterations occur within the microbe affecting varying degree of resistance is another factor. The antibiotic selection pressure is another factor of modifying the host\u2019s microbiota. The host system is subjected to a phenomenon of \u201cselective pressure\u201d when treated with antibiotics during infection. With a greater activity scale, the resistance frequency increases. This results in the resistant species surviving in the host population as compared to the susceptible strain with the harsh effect of the antibiotic. So being a reservoir increases the chances of infection spread to a greater extent. Antibiotics like cephalosporins, azithromycin, and fluoroquinolones bring about this effect of \u201cselective pressure\u201d in eukaryotic hosts. A careful and considerate use of antimicrobials is highly recommended for human safety. This high-end technical and materialistic world should concern the appropriate prescription of a much selective and narrow-range antibiotic thereby minimizing the risk of resistance development. Other factors include the drug exposure properties and concentration dosage dealing with their pharmacokinetic profile, the drug-pattern usage and its distribution scale, the immune system of the host (immunocompromised individuals are more prone to infection), pathogen\u2019s fitness cost of tolerance, and influence of nonresistant therapeutics, thereby affecting the pathogen\u2019s transmission intensity. However the poor and developing nations are reeling under the burden of drug resistance which directly affects their economic turnover. As a consequence, one has to raise the standards of high-end sophisticated health services and prevent the prevalence of community-associated infections.",

            "text": "Different factors acts as fulcrum in the process of drug resistance development (Wright and Poinar 2012). But which factors determine the most influential parameter for developing resistance and which factors remain insignificant are still under investigation. It\u2019s yet to be defined that how adaptation enable the microbe to culminate their survival strategy with resistance development. The understanding of the molecular and clinical mechanisms that ignite the \u201ctrigger responses\u201d for microbial acclimatization has just begun. The literature of therapeutic invention has led to the conclusion that the once susceptible strains have developed weapons of resistance against the sensitive drug. For instance, a span of five decades made Streptococcus species resistant to penicillin and S. aureus resistant to vancomycin. This will enable one to formulate new mechanisms for restructuring new designs for drug development against many life-threatening diseases. Among the risk factors responsible for the emergence of drug resistance, illogical and rampant use of antibiotics is one of the crucial reasons for such an issue (Alanis 2005). The uncontrolled application of drugs in agricultural industry and in animals is becoming another rising factor for not only food production but also resistance development. Moreover treating immunocompromised individuals with life-saving drugs, increasing the survival chances of patients with unrestrained drug usage, and greater usage of invasive processes are other factors adding to the therapeutic tolerances. Greater medical advancements have led to control of infection and increased life expectancy of many patients. Even minor causes like lack of effective methods of hygiene and restrictions while handling infected patients can minimize the risk level of resistance to some extent. Not only widespread use of antibiotics but also harsh chemicals like herbicides, organic pesticides, and other toxic agents along with chemotherapies for cancer and viral, parasitic, and fungal treatments have raised the concern for resistance emergence. The resistance mechanism in microbes, plants, and humans portrays certain homology in the proteins conferring such tolerance mechanism. Microbial genetics play a central role in shaping up the molecular structure for centralizing the mechanistic studies of drug resistance. The horizontal gene transfer influencing resistance linkage enables the co-selection of resistant species with tolerance to more than drug (Alonso et al. 2001; Baker-Austin et al. 2006). Reduced use of one drug can\u2019t revert back the resistance if the genetic alterations already support other resistance genes. Moreover co-selection can also lead to clonal substitution of the resistance-linked allele. Similar structural framework of drugs can even confer co-selection. This again challenges the regulatory checks. Drug resistance can be categorized into intrinsic and acquired resistance. The detailed mechanistic approach will be discussed in the sections ahead. Intrinsic mechanism deals with the natural ability of the microbe as an innate immunity mechanism, whereas acquired mechanism deals with the environmental influence bringing about genetic modification, thereby giving a new dimension to resistance aspect.",

Some pumps specifically extrude particular antibiotics such as macrolides, lincosamides, streptogramins, and tetracyclines, whereas multiple drug resistance pumps throw away a variety of structurally and functionally different drugs (Lewis 1994).

These multi-subunit targets play a pivotal role during DNA duplication each comprising of two subunits: GyrA and GyrB for DNA gyrase and ParC/GrlA and ParE/GrlB for topoisomerase IV. One subunit of these complexes functions for the DNA-binding role, whereas the other carries up the ATP-binding and hydrolysis role.

Innumerable mutations impose additive effects to build up the bacterium\u2019s resistant trait.

The structural and functional characterization classifies \u03b2-lactamases into two groups, one having serine at the active catalytic site (classes A, C, D) and another with zinc-dependent metalloenzyme (class B). Being zinc dependent, class B enzymes are susceptible to EDTA and hydrolyze carbapenems. AmpC, a prototypic class C-type enzyme being plasmid borne, is easily transferred among many Gram-negative strains like Salmonella spp., Klebsiella spp., etc. (Jacoby 2009). Even the acetyltransferases, phosphotransferases, and adenylates that modify the aminoglycosides exist on certain mobile genetic units or integrons where they enable resistance transmission. The MLS antibiotics are inhibited by groups of esterases as well as phosphotransferases that modulate 14- and 15-membered macrolides (Nakajima 1999). The acetyltransferases and hydrolases affect streptogramin A and B drugs, respectively. The transferase enzyme concerned with nucleotidyl moiety transfer bestows resistance to lincosamides antibiotics. Even chloramphenicol, which targets the protein biosynthetic machinery, is a bacteriostatic drug which is inactivated by certain groups of acetyltransferases.

The mechanism involved genes contributing to changes in PBPs that confers \u03b2-lactam resistance in Streptococcus as well as Staphylococcus. This gene is encoded by mecA on a mobile genetic unit in resistant Staphylococcus aureus (Wielders et al. 2001). The \u201cstaphylococcal cassette chromosome\u201d is the mobile element comprising of regulatory segments and enzymes responsible for site-specific recombination. The cell wall synthetic process requires a number of PBPs in Staphylococcus aureus. PBP2 enzyme plays dual role in resistant S. aureus where the transpeptidase and transglycosylase activities switch in accordance to drug exposure for imparting susceptibility or tolerance features in the microbe (Brown and Reynolds 1980). The plasmid-borne qnr determinants found widely in Gram-negative species of E. coli, Shigella, non-typhoidal Salmonella, etc., affect fluoroquinolone sensitivity (Piekarska et al. 2011). The pentapeptide repeat protein family includes Qnr as well as MfpA which regulate fluoroquinolone resistance by shielding DNA gyrase and topoisomerase II, respectively. Qnr additionally protects topoisomerase from drug effect. Moreover MfpA in Mycobacterium forms an identical structural outlook of B-DNA-inhibiting ciprofloxacin activity by interaction with DNA gyrase (Montero et al. 2001). Coupled with other modes, Qnr and MfpA can amplify the resistance profile to higher extents. Glycopeptides form the major example of bearing the drug resistance feature due to drug target modifications in Gram-positive spherical bacteria. Multiple clustered proteins contribute to resistance by modulating the peptidoglycan production. The complex elucidation of unveiling the glycopeptide resistance concerns gene clusters like racemases or dehydrogenases forming serine and lactate, respectively, which alter the peptidoglycan framework. The two-component unit regulates the cellular biosynthetic mechanisms. With intact d-Ala available, the reduced interaction efficiency with serine and lactate substrates nullifies. The dipeptidase and carboxypeptidase act in accordance to their respective function of cleaving and removing the terminal d-alanine. The vanA gene cluster conferring vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus has transferred its resistance determinants even in S. aureus encoded on Tn1546 transposon. However, plasmid from E. faecalis forms the initial mode of vanA transfer into Staphylococcus. The erythromycin resistance methylase (erm) influences the macrolide drug-binding affinity by methylation of adenine residues of 23S rRNA (Maravic 2004); Vester and Douthwaite 2001.

Efflux pump mechanism ejects the drug out of the cell and was initially observed during tetracycline resistance development. The five protein transporter families involved in efflux machinery are ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, resistance\u2013nodulation\u2013cell division (RND) protein superfamily, major facilitator (MF) protein groups, small multidrug resistance (SMR) units, and multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) protein superfamily (Poole 2005). ABC group of primary transporters employ ATP hydrolysis for efflux mechanism, whereas the rest secondary groups involve proton-motive gradient force for conferring drug expulsion (Kobayashi et al. 2001). The drug discharge proteins are either categorized into single protein component systems having narrow substrate range or bear two proteins to facilitate the binding of variable structural compounds conferring wide spectrum of resistance phenotypes. RND transporters enable efflux of cytosolic proteins through the inner and outer membrane barriers. The 20 tetracycline efflux transporters comprise of transmembrane spanning regions where the protein expression is regulated under the transcriptional repressor. The inactivation of the repressor by the drug promotes the expression of the tetracycline efflux machinery. TetA-E are the efflux proteins in Gram-negative bacteria, with TetK and L in Gram-positive microbes, and TetR is the repressor (Schnappinger and Hillen 1996). Certain proteins are also involved in electroneutral chemical reactions. Additionally, macrolide and streptogramin tolerance is attributed by a group of ABC efflux protein family called MsrA. Its homologues VgaA and VgaB in Staphylococcus bring about streptogramin A and pristinamycin resistance, respectively (Lina et al. 1999). Mef efflux systems also confer macrolide resistance in Streptococcus. Removal of efflux machinery can revert back the genetic profile to antibiotic susceptibility even with the persistence of chromosomal alterations. E1\u2013E8 are the groups of efflux protein superfamily that confer phenicol resistance. CmlA is an efflux system aiding in chloramphenicol resistance, which promotes an induced attenuation-based resistance mechanism (Bischoff et al. 2005). Porin proteins enable the smooth flow of molecules across the cell membrane barrier in Gram-negative bacteria (Delcour 2009). OmpF in Escherichia coli and OprD in Pseudomonas act as checkpoints to monitor the nonspecific entry of many compounds. OprD mutational changes lead to imipenem tolerance. Simultaneous expression and regulation of OprD and MexEF-OprM efflux complex will confer carbapenem resistance (Lee and Ko 2012; Quale et al. 2006). The bacterial cell envelop restricts and permits selective entry of many hydrophobic and hydrophilic components. Resistance to polymyxin B however doesn\u2019t involve porins but cell envelope alterations. The PmrAB system regulates the LPS and lipid A moiety changes which confers polymyxin B resistance in Salmonella Typhimurium (Gunn 2008).",

            "text": "After all the advancements in cancer research, emergence of drug resistance restricted the efficacy of the therapies. Resistance to cancer chemotherapy results from a range of factors, starting from individual variations in patients and somatic cell genetic differences in tumor, even those from the same tissue of origin (Dean et al. 2005). Resistance can be intrinsic as well as acquired. Chemotherapy resistance occurs when cancers that have been responding to a drug suddenly stop reacting. There are several possible reasons responsible which mainly include:Some cancer cells that escape the harmful effects of the drug mutate and develop resistance toward the drug. Later, upon multiplication, they become more resistant.Gene amplification: A cancer cell has the ability to produce hundreds of copies of genes of a particular gene. This leads to the overexpression of the corresponding protein, which in turn makes the anticancer drug ineffective.With the help of a molecule called p-glycoprotein (P-gp), cancer cells pump out the drug entering the system using their proficient drug efflux pumps.Highly efficient DNA damage repair machinery, one of the survival secrets of cancer cells, also plays vital role in contributing resistance against anticancer drugs (Holohan et al. 2013).Cancer cells may also develop strategies to inactivate the drugs (Holohan et al. 2013).\n",

            "text": "The molecular mechanisms of drug resistance in tumors are discussed in details in the following segments:\nAltered membrane transport: One of the most promising drug resistance mechanisms against antineoplastic agents is the method by which the cell flushes out the cytotoxic compound with the help of some membrane proteins that helps to reduce the inside drug concentration below the cell-killing threshold. These proteins modulate absorption, distribution, and excretion of many pharmacological compounds. ABC transporters are encoded by as many as 48 genes. In the clinical transport-associated MDR, the most commonly involved gene is the MDR1 that encodes for the P-glycoprotein (P-gp; MDR1, ABCB1) which is a phosphorylated and glycosylated 170 kDa protein. Other well-known ABC transporters are the MDR-associated protein 1 (MRP1, ABCC1), the mitoxantrone resistance protein (MXR1/BCRP, ABCG2), and the ABCB4 (MDR3) and ABCB11 (sister P-gp or BSEP) proteins involved in the secretion of hepatic phosphatidylcholine and bile acids, respectively, as well as transport of certain drugs. The most interesting feature of differentiating MDR proteins from other mammalian transporters is their high substrate specificity. Unlike classical transporters, MDR transporters translocate a variety of structurally different hydrophobic compounds along with other unique compounds, and this forms the platform for the cross-resistance to many chemically unrelated compounds. Overexpression of MDR proteins in tumors like hepatomas and lung or colon carcinomas often shows intrinsic resistance (Gottesman 2002; Gottesman et al. 2002). The role of P-gp, in the absence of any therapeutic agent or toxin, is thought to protect the cell from xenobiotics. However, several reports suggest P-gp to have prognostic significance in certain types of neoplasms as well as to play an important role in CNS penetration of drugs (Begley 2004). But all these have failed to correlate with the clinical evidence. So, its mode of action has always been controversial. According to some reports, MDR proteins are not responsible for transporting drugs, but they alter ion transport or signal transduction, thus later on affecting drug distribution. In tumor cells, anticancer drugs and cytotoxic cytokines like TNF/Fas ligand family play an important role in induction of apoptosis and tumor therapy (Reed 2003). Drug-resistant tumor cell lines show resistance to Fas-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis which is reported to be mediated by P-gp. The cells expressing P-gp are resistant to a lot of stimuli responsible for the activation of caspase apoptotic cascade, whereas it is not the case in caspase-independent cell death where cell dies by the action of pore-forming proteins GzB.\nGenetic responses: Drugs such as methotrexate inhibit key enzymes involved in the proliferation pathway of mammalian cells. When transcription of the gene encoding for the enzyme increases, large amount of enzyme is produced that leads to faster proliferation. But the concentration of the drug is limited which cannot block the additional enzyme that is produced. Thus the cells develop resistance against the drug. One way to overexpress the enzyme is by the amplification of the gene encoding the enzyme, which is achieved by replication of a region from the chromosome that results in multiple copies of the same gene. Several drug-resistant cancer cell lines and DNA from two drug-resistant leukemic patients have shown gene rearrangements in their chromosome resulting in the initial activation or enhanced expression of MDR1 gene. Moreover, therapy with rifampicin has also shown to induce MDR1 expression in healthy individuals. Hence, MDR1 overexpression can be affected by gene amplification/rearrangement, rifampicin induction, etc. Another important factor responsible in drug-resistant cancer is the mutation in the apoptotic gene p53. p53 usually induces apoptosis in cells which have undergone DNA damage (Chen et al. 1996). Thus, the target DNA won\u2019t be affected and will continue replicating in the presence of mutated p53. So, the drugs that increase DNA damage will come to no use in certain cancers. In many cancer cases, deletion of p53 was reported to be linked to MDR. Also, reduced expression of p53 in human breast cancer cells altered response to paclitaxel and 5-FU. Other genes involved in apoptotic pathway, like h-ras and bcl2/bax, have also been observed to contribute to drug resistance (Davis et al. 2003). Thus drug resistance arising from genetic responses affects a large variety of anticancer drugs and increases the percentage of surviving mutant cells, which in turn leads to greater tumor heterogeneity.\nEnhanced DNA repair: Cancer cells develop resistance to drugs such as cisplatin by an enhanced ability to remove cisplatin-DNA adducts and to repair the cisplatin-induced lesions with the help of certain DNA repair proteins like XPE-BF (xeroderma pigmentosum group E binding factor). ERCC1 (excision repair cross-complementing protein), a DNA-binding protein, has the ability to recognize cisplatin-induced DNA damage and thus its level increases in cisplatin-resistant cells (Siddik 2003). The level of ERCC1 is also found to increase in carboplatin-resistant tumors.\nAlterations in target molecules: Modifications in the target of a drug is a common way to develop resistance against the same. As seen in antiestrogen (e.g., tamoxifen) therapy for breast cancer, patients undergo a transition from a responsive state to an endocrine-resistant state due to an apparent loss of estrogen receptors in the resistant cancer cells (Ring and Dowsett 2004). So they finally stop responding to tamoxifen treatment, while the growth of their tumors can still be inhibited for a short span by estrogen synthesis inhibitors like aromatase inhibitors followed by complete unresponsiveness to any endocrine modification. Hence, the surviving cancer cells no longer depend on estrogen for growth and the original drug that targets estrogen receptors becomes useless. Another example is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib, which induces apoptosis in cancer cells by disabling the damaged bcr-abl receptors, preventing ATP binding (Capdeville et al. 2002). But reports suggest that during clinical trials, the chronic myeloid leukemic patients in remission had reactivated bcr-abl activity, few patients had amplified copies of the bcr-abl gene, and others had a single point mutation within the ATP-binding site of the gene. Hence, this gene shows to play an important role in initiation and maintenance of cancer and thus related to anticancer drug resistance (Dean et al. 2005). Mutation in the topoisomerase gene is another cause of drug resistance due to its vital role in DNA replication process. Chemotherapeutic drug like etoposide that targets topoisomerase II suffers from resistance when cancer cells mutate the latter in a way to alter its nuclear localization. Chromosomal losses are very common in cancer, and due to its aneuploid nature, there has been the emergence of MDR. While undergoing repeated cell division for a number of times, a cancer cell has the chance of losing the drug-sensitive gene from the chromosome, and also chromosomal rearrangement during mitosis can contribute to the activation or inactivation of different biochemical pathways that can affect the mode of action of the drug. The size of the tumor also matters as the center part of most tumors has limited blood supply. So, the larger the tumor, the lower the drug efficacy. Apart from this, some metabolic enzymes, either alone or together with transporters like P-gps, can alter the drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. For example, enzymes like cytochrome p450s (cyp450) in combination with P-gp greatly affect the drug absorption and bio-distribution to the tissues preventing intestinal transcellular permeability, biliary disposition in the liver, urinary elimination through the kidney, and placental transport.\nMetabolic effects: Effective clearance of drugs can often be achieved by some xenobiotics that have the ability to modify high-density apolipoprotein or by overexpression of the drug-metabolizing enzymes and/or carrier molecules. The increased production of glutathione or ubiquitin leads to drug inactivity by the formation of conjugates that are excreted, for example, cisplatin that becomes resistant to ovarian carcinomas after the overexpression of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase. In some cases, the underexpression of few drug-metabolizing enzymes (e.g., deoxycytidine kinase) can also lessen drug (e.g., arabinosidase) activity in a situation where the drug needs to be catalytically cleaved to be in its active form. Additionally, protein kinase C has been found to have increased activity in the drug-resistant breast carcinoma cells because of its role in both drug exclusion and apoptosis (Caponigro et al. 1997). Breast cancer cells have shown resistance against paclitaxel and vincristine due to the involvement of the extracellular matrix as well. The ligation of the b1 integrins by the extracellular matrix inhibits apoptosis mediated by these two drugs.\nGrowth factors: High levels of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been observed in different drug-resistant cancer cells, whereas cells sensitive to the chemotherapy did not produce any detectable IL-6. The reason behind this resistance was attributed to the activation of the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein family of transcription factors and induction of MDR1 gene expression (Okamura et al. 2004). Reports have also suggested that extracellular factors can contribute to drug resistance against a particular cancer. Like increased levels of acidic and basic fibroblast, growth factors in the media of solid and metastatic tumors can affect the broad-spectrum drug (paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and 5-FU) efficacy and lead to develop resistance. When applied in combination, these two growth factors can give rise to a tenfold increase in drug resistance.\n",

            "text": "The invention of an antibiotic and its widespread acceptance for clinical use have limited time period for their medications. From months to few years, these antibiotics have proven to emerge resistant to their targeted bacterial strain (Bush et al. 2011). For instance, penicillin developed resistance among the bacterial populations within a span of 2 years after its global use. Similarly, vancomycin resistance against enterococci did spread at an alarming rate within 5 years of its introduction during the late 1980s. The resistance involves a collective action of five genes, the major reason why vancomycin resistance took a greater time to evolve (Walsh et al. 1996). The clinically important resistance is dependent bacterial doubling time, where the intrinsic resistance can lead to genetic alterations in 1:100 ratio finally amassing a pool of resistant superbugs. In this population, if the resistant species proves superior and tolerates the antibiotic, then the pool of sensitive population are killed where the resistant species fills up the numbers of the susceptible ones with their own dominant resistant type. A subtherapeutic medication assures practical resistant species outgrowth. Antibacterial resistance generally involves four basic mechanisms of target modification, drug inactivation, decreased drug uptake, and increased efflux systems (Alekshun and Levy 2007). Bacterial drug resistance thereby can be intrinsic due to the inherent property of the microorganism or acquired due to the evolutionary process of spontaneous mutations or gene uptake. Intrinsic mechanism makes bacterium naturally resistant to antibiotics like all mycoplasma withstand \u03b2-lactam action due to lack of peptidoglycan wall. A primary reason for resistance development is due to the spread of the antibiotic resistance genes on the plasmids that get multiplied independently and carried over to the next-generation doublets thereby conferring resistance (Yoneyama and Katsumata 2006). In certain cases, such genes can be evenly segregated onto the mobile genetic elements like transposons that can jump from one DNA locus into another. Similar occurrence happens in Enterococcus-resistant vancomycin strain where the five genes of microbial cargo hop into variant genomic locales. In medical environments, selective antibiotic pressures on pathogens like S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis enable them to switch their antibiotic-susceptible profile to resistant ones. For instance, the methicillin-susceptible strain of S. aureus (MSSA) becomes resistant (MRSA) in patients with surgical treatments within a span of 5 days in hospitals. These isolates become resistant to vancomycin treatment. Hence, the antibiotic pressure alters the sensitivity genomic contour of the pathogen triggering the antibiotic resistance switch, for which new discoveries should target the molecular approach of resistance that makes these pathogens superbugs (Walsh 2000).",

            "text": "The major antibacterial drug resistance strategy involved is mostly the efflux pump mechanism where the microbe pumps out the antibiotic preventing their disruption of cellular processes (Poole 2005). The intrinsic mechanism of resistance is known to induce the expression of efflux pump systems. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the disruption of the functioning of MexB pump raises the sensitivity to antibiotics like tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, \u03b2-lactams, etc. (Lomovskaya et al. 2001). Hence antibiotics can regulate the efflux pump expression in microbes at the transcription level of gene function. Transporters can be expressed due to the modulation of these regulators. In Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the efflux machinery encoded by the mtr operon eases the transport of antimicrobial components. However, mutation in the mtrR gene increases the bug\u2019s resistance to penicillins, macrolides, as well as rifamycins (Veal et al. 2002). Secondly in P. aeruginosa, exposure to fluoroquinolones leads to mutations in the genes encoding for efflux proteins as well as topoisomerases. Again mutation in efflux genes augments the resistance level to fluoroquinolones in P. aeruginosa. Streptococcus pneumoniae is known to be resistant mostly due to the drug efflux pumping out bacterial strategy. The resistance in Streptococcus occurs in a stepwise regulated way initiating in parC mutations, followed by gyrA and then PmrA pump (Jones et al. 2000; Piddock et al. 2002). Each level of mutation confers to a greater degree of resistance. In the 1980s, active efflux became major players in antibiotic resistance that led to the emergence of multiple drug-resistant strains (MDRs). Efflux transporters are known to be polyspecific where they eject out a huge diversity of structurally nonidentical components (Piddock 2006b). Additionally the MDR efflux systems eject out toxic compounds enabling the microbe to escape the classic antibiotic therapy (Paulsen 2003). There are five basic protein families that form the category of bacterial efflux pump system. Two well-known protein families are the ABC superfamily (ATP-binding cassette) along with the MFS (major facilitator superfamily). Other three small units include the SMR (small multidrug resistance), the RND (resistance\u2013nodulation\u2013cell division), and the MATE (multidrug and toxic compounds extrusion) family (Piddock 2006a). Other than ABC family pumps, the rest transporters are termed as secondary transporters conjugated to proton influx, hence called as H1-drug antiporters. Conversely, the primary transporters, i.e., ABC, utilize ATP for their activity.",

            "text": "The most important factor in causing bacterial death is the accumulation of harsh antibiotics within the cytoplasmic fraction for inhibitory effects or growth attenuation. With Gram-positive bacteria lacking an outer plasma membrane barrier, the production of transporters enables the efflux mechanism to confer resistance within such species. Additionally the tough exterior of Gram-negative bacteria avoids drug buildup. As mentioned above, the Gram-positive bacteria comprise of three protein transporter superfamilies, namely, the ABC family of transporters which harnesses cytoplasmic ATP for antibiotic ejection and MF and SMR transporter protein groups which exploit an electrochemical proton gradient for efflux mechanism (Markham and Neyfakh 2001). The molecular mechanism of relating the ATP and proton exchange with drug efflux is still under investigation. Failures in X-ray structural characterization of transporter molecules have also raised major scientific concern. The examples of substrate-specific efflux pumps are either macrolide specific or tetracycline targeted (TetKLZ) which confer an additional function of immunity for the microbe. The issue of drug recognition can be resolved by getting an insight into the structural aspect of proteins regulating the efflux protein expression. The TetR protein binds to tetracycline leading to the overexpression of tetracycline substrate-specific transporter. This drug DNA-binding repressor undergoes a conventional van der Waals mode of interaction where the H bonds facilitate the linkage of tetracycline\u2013Mg2+ complex with the polar amino acids bound with water molecules. The ligand binding occurs proper with a defined chemical architecture. So tetracycline transporters undergo substrate-specific interaction that governs their efflux mechanism. Another level of interaction occurs in the transcriptional regulator of the well-known bacterial species of Bacillus subtilis. The BmrR regulator induces the production of Bmr multidrug efflux protein which expels out intracellular hydrophobic cations (Paulsen 2003). In such case of regulators, the ligand binding occurs by means of both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions rather than hydrogen bonds. So the dependency on structural outlook of substrate specificity becomes limited. The substrate specificity of the transporters is linked to its multidrug abilities. For instance, the evolutionarily distinct transporters of B. subtilis (Bmr, Blt) and S. aureus (NorA) share functional and sequence homology with transporters of Lactococcus lactis (LmrP) and Staphylococcus (QacA) itself as they belong to the identical MF family. They are much more homologous to the tetracycline transporters of Gram-negative bacteria. Even there is very insignificant identity among the same group of transporters like tetracycline, efflux proteins TetK and TetL bear very less similarity to TetZ of C. glutamicum. Both TetK and TetL share much similarity rather than the multidrug efflux units of Staphylococcus QacA. Another example to illustrate the mechanism of substrate recognition and binding is the class of lipocalins (Gunn 2008). These proteins share a similar tertiary structural outlook and bear high binding affinity for diversified substrates (ligands). Some lipocalins are even identical to multidrug efflux units enabling the organic compounds to interact with the hydrophobic protein core. The diversity of substrate binding by lipocalins was well demonstrated through mutagenesis of the hydrophobic binding residues. This resulted in switching the affinity partially toward the hydrophilic fluorescein moieties. This led to the modulation of substrate recognition. Hereby, Gram-positive bacterial species bear different modulated transporters under the ABC, MF, and SMR family to force out the harsh antimicrobial agents.",

The sequence homologies screened many other hypothetical transporter genes in Bacillus. Efflux mechanism can be an opportunistic attempt by these multidrug transporters. For instance, tetracycline transporters have an additional function of transporting monovalent ions like Na+ and K+; other than tetracycline and genetic alterations of such transporters confers antibiotic and saline susceptibility. Examples of such transporters are TetL and TetK from B. subtilis and S. aureus, respectively. Being translationally regulated by tetracycline, these transporters channel the transport of monovalent ions as a side effect of drug transport. Similarly in B. subtilis, the two specific multidrug transporters Bmr and Blt are distinctly and differentially regulated at the transcriptional level (Ahmed et al. 1995). Blt and Bmr transporters extrude polyamines from the bacterium. However the Bmr\u2013BmrR combination functions to assure toxin protection.

Other than target modulation and enzymatic blockage, the efflux pump mechanism in these antibiotic classes showcases tolerance features in Gram-positive strains. The efflux mechanism was due to msrA and msrB genes discovered in Staphylococcus and msrC gene in Enterococcus provided 200-fold and eightfold increase in resistance, respectively (Schmitz et al. 2000). In macrolide-resistant Streptococcus, the mefA or mefE genes augment tolerance level to 60-fold. These genes code for MF family transporters. The mef genes account for macrolide resistance in many Gram-positive as well as Gram-negative pathogens. It is present within mobile transposons; thereby, the tolerance mechanism will spread rapidly among other pathogenic species. Similarly, tetracycline transporters TetK and TetL predominantly account for antibiotic tolerance in Staphylococcus as well as Enterococcus. For greater antibiotic efficiency, decreased affinity of tetracycline derivatives via efflux pump mechanism has been approached, for example, glycyclines. The second approach encourages the use of tetracycline analogs in conjugation with the antibiotic blocking efflux transporters. Fluoroquinolone resistance occurs due to topoisomerase and DNA gyrase modulation by multidrug efflux transporters, for instance, NorA of S. aureus belonging to MF family. Greater NorA expression leads to acquired ciprofloxacin tolerance in addition to intrinsic fluoroquinolone resistance. Targeting efflux pump mechanisms increases the response of pathogen to antimicrobials as well as promotes drug accumulation within the bacterium. Cationic peptides target different resistance mechanism of Pseudomonas against antimicrobials, namely, efflux method and target site modification to highlight the role of membrane barrier as a target for overcoming pathogen tolerance (Lin et al. 2010).",

Accumulation or expelling out antibacterial agents from cells doesn\u2019t modulate with the structure of the antibiotic. Like in penicillins and cephalosporins, the inactivation of \u03b2-lactam ring will cripple the efficacy of the antibiotic itself. B-lactamase is the enzyme that catalyzes this modulation. The active ring enables acetylation and modulation of the peptidoglycan cross-links, whose disruption renders the antibiotic nonfunctional. The lactamase enzyme is produced in the bacterial periplasm to inactivate the cytoplasmic antibiotic targets. A single enzyme can cripple about hundred penicillin particles, so the greater the enzyme, the higher the intensity of antibiotic destruction and the more efficient the strategy. However, other antibacterial compounds like aminoglycosides aren\u2019t prone to such hydrolytic cleavage. Aminoglycosides target the protein synthetic machinery and bear three specific chemical alternates that bring modulation in the ribosomal RNA binding. The aminoglycoside resistance can be due to the adenylyl, phosphoryl, or acetyl transferases which insert either an AMP moiety or phosphate group or bring about amino acid acetylation. These modifications decrease the RNA binding affinity and disrupt with the protein synthesis. The structural elucidation of phosphotransferase shows a direct evidence of evolutionary link to kinase enzyme thereby facilitating the recruitment of bacterial resistance strategies.",

            "text": "The third resistance approach employed by the microbes involves the modulation or reprogramming of the target enzyme in the resistant pathogen. This camouflage mechanism can occur in conjugation with the efflux mechanism thereby adding up to the resistance strategy. For example, the erythromycin-resistant strains alter the adenine moieties by methylation in the peptidyl transferase loop of ribosomal RNA unit (McCusker and Fujimori 2012). The erythromycin ribosomal methylase gene targets the decreased RNA affinity for erythromycin as well as pristinamycin drugs without blocking the protein synthesis. This method of methylation is the prime machinery of resistance in the virulent species of S. aureus and acts as immunity armor against erythromycin-expressing strains. Other than erythromycin, target modulation is also observed in vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) to escape the harsh antibiotic effects. In the resistant Enterococcus, the vanHAX gene encodes a pathway where these three genes play different modulatory roles for providing a survival advantage to the bacterium (Sood et al. 2008). vanH gene enables pyruvate reduction to d-lactate followed by vanA forming d-Ala-d-Lac and vanX hydrolyzing the d-alanine dipeptide rather than d-Ala-d-Lac linkage. Overall, the accumulation of d-Ala-d-Lac substrate becomes the point of elongation and extension at the peptidoglycan terminal strands. This remodulation of the d-alanine dipeptide to d-Ala-d-Lac affects the degree of vancomycin binding by 1000-folds without impairing the glycan and peptide cross-linking efficiency. This tolerance confers a greater profile of vancomycin resistance. Consequently not only does \u03b2-lactamase production affect the resistance mechanism, but also the penicillin-binding proteins bring about lower antibiotic affinity. In Staphylococcus aureus, the characterization of a penicillin-binding protein encoded by the mecA gene will help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of MRSA phenotype.",

Among the life-threatening species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has become a global threat for mortality with time. The major survival advantage of M. tuberculosis is its dormant stage which sustains in asymptomatic hosts that later on leads to disease. Mycobacterium tuberculosis makes use of all the efflux transporters for their survival. The major two mechanisms thought to play a pivotal role in mycobacterial drug resistance are the cell wall barrier and the efflux pump machinery (Silva and Palomino 2011). The genes that encode for efflux transporters have been extensively studied as they encode for proteins that channelize compounds like tetracycline, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and drugs like isoniazid used for tuberculosis treatment itself. Hence, the balance between pumping out antibiotics and enabling cellular drug intake is yet to be explored further for new inventions (De Rossi et al. 2006). In spite of the BCG vaccine, resistance has also been observed against many anti-TB compounds. With the course of time, the M. tuberculosis strains have developed mutations that have actively targeted the drug stimulation giving rise to MDR-TB strains. For instance, the streptomycin resistance develops due to changes in the genes like rrs and rpsL which alters the ribosomal binding site for streptomycin. Even the pncA gene alteration leads to pyrazinamidase resistance in this notorious bug. Isoniazid has drug targets that are involved in the cell wall biosynthesis (mycolic acid), but they don\u2019t entirely confer resistance. The prime reason of natural resistance in M. tuberculosis is decreased cell wall permeability due to high lipid content which limits cellular drug intake. Another factor that comes into play is the efflux system that forces out antimicrobial agents. The microbial efflux and influx balance thereby contributes to the microbial sustenance.",

            "text": "Efflux pump machinery is mostly responsible for the dominance of resistance mechanism among the fungal pathogens. This is a common mechanism of antibiotic resistance in S. pneumoniae. The two efflux pumps in pathogens conferring azole resistance comprise of proteins belonging to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. Moreover, ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters are the major culprits of drug resistance. MFS protein pumps involve the passage of structurally diverse components. MDR1 in fluconazole-resistant Candida strains were known to encode resistance for benomyl as well as methotrexate. The ABC transporters require ATP for substrate channelization for which they bear two ATP-binding cytoplasmic moieties. Other than that, there are four core integral domains that span the membrane a couple of times. In S. cerevisiae, the ABC transporters recognized are classified into MDR, CFTR, YEF, and PDR families. Five CDR (Candida drug resistance) genes in Candida are responsible for azole resistance (White et al. 2002). CDR1 present in Cryptococcus and Candida is structurally similar to human P-glycoprotein. When C. albicans was experimented for its ability to mount up fluconazole, an overexpression of CDR1 levels was found with reduced drug concentrations. Secondly, reduced fluconazole accumulation could be due to the ATP-dependent drug efflux mechanism. A study by Sanglard et al. carried out experiments involving 16 C. albicans clinical isolates from five individuals with HIV infections (Sanglard et al. 1995). The aim was to observe the accumulation of fluconazole with treatment. Fewer amounts of fluconazole levels did correspond to tenfold higher CDR1 mRNA profile. However, with overexpressed CaMDR1 mRNA level, normal CDR1 transcriptomic levels were observed. This concludes that CDR1 is mostly involved in the transport of azole antifungals, whereas CaMDR1 gene specifically enables fluconazole resistance development. A CDR1 mutation enabled greater susceptibility of C. albicans to triazoles. Similarly, CDR2 induction resulted in azole resistance. A double knockout mutant (CDR1 and CDR2 deletion) strain showed greater susceptibility than a single gene disruption. Moreover using membrane potential as the driving force, MDR1 overexpression also leads to azole resistance. A study reported the accumulation of a fluorescent rhodamine 123 dye in C. albicans and C. glabrata (Clark et al. 1996). This dye is specifically transported by the MDR machinery. This mechanism also leads to a phenomenon of efflux competition. Additionally, ABC transporters overexpression is a crucial factor in promoting azole resistance in C. glabrata isolates. However, exposure to azoles can contribute to a transcriptional alteration in CDR profiling. The sterol composition doesn\u2019t influence resistance; rather the genes like ERG16, MDR1, and CDR1 are involved in microbial tolerance mechanism. Secondly continuous azole exposure can lead to an induced expression of ERG16 as well as CDR1 genes, thereby leading to cross-resistance among other azole medications.",

            "text": "The most common example with respect to enzyme alteration is lanosterol demethylase whose overexpression confers azole resistance in C. glabrata. The modification of this enzyme plays a pivotal role in conferring azole resistance mechanism. No difference in sterol distribution was found in two fluconazole resistant and susceptible C. krusei strains. The inhibitory effect of fluconazole was 20\u201340 % higher in C. krusei than C. albicans. This is due to greater active efflux mechanisms in C. krusei isolates. With respect to 14a-demethylase enzyme modification, the azole-susceptible units were found to have an altered peak in the carbon monoxide spectra of the cytochrome. Moreover, this enzyme has low affinity for azole drugs. Whether alteration of the enzyme is the sole factor remains still a question. Thereby, certain cases have reported the overexpression as major criteria for resistance mechanism. The overexpression leads to enhanced copies of the enzyme which promotes ergosterol synthesis and enables resistance development against fluconazole as well as itraconazole. Here the ergosterol increase could be attributed to the overexpressed enzyme as well as to the less susceptibility of both azoles and amphotericin B. Some studies have focused on P-450 levels for conferring cross-resistance in azoles. But in C. albicans, the increased expression doesn\u2019t have much of an impact. Azoles are inhibitors of ergosterol synthesis by modulating the binding with the demethylase enzyme. Further the ERG11 gene was investigated for its role in drug selection pressure. Sequence analysis in C. albicans targeted amino acid substitutions at the active site of the enzyme (i.e., the heme domain) to be responsible for resistance development. ERG11 (ERG16) is the gene encoding for the protein, also termed as CYP51A1 in C. albicans (Marichal et al. 1999). Any alteration or mutation in this gene conferred azole tolerance. Lysine substitution with arginine at 467th residue near the heme domain brought about functional alteration to the enzymatic activity. Even a 464th residue substitution in C. albicans caused heme domain alteration contributing to fluconazole resistance with reduced activity. A study reported a T315A substitution in C. albicans showed twofold reduction in lanosterol demethylase catalytic activity and diminished affinity for fluconazole (Lamb et al. 1997). These substitutions also lead to decreased accessibility of the enzyme active site as was observed when the 105th phenylalanine residue was replaced with leucine in C. albicans. The antifungal agent fluconazole has a channelized entry into the active site where certain point mutations alter the accessibility of the substrates. These mutations are huddled up around three specific regions that are linked with resistance.",

Amphotericin B, the broad-spectrum antifungal agent, targets ergosterol and is active against Candida species, Cryptococcus neoformans, strains of Aspergillus, Zygomycetes, etc. (Brajtburg et al. 1990). The polyene-susceptible pathogens are known to bear sterols in their cell membrane as compared to the resistant ones. The literature suggests sterol addition for counterbalancing the fungal inhibitory effect of polyenes. The physicochemical interplay between membrane sterols and polyene antifungals restricts the binding affinity of drugs. Their interaction can be directly quantified with UV absorbance. The mode of action of amphotericin B involves the aggregation of 8\u201310 polyene molecules to form a porin channel within bilayer membrane for disrupting fungal ionic gradient by loss of potassium ions. This pore enables polyene hydroxyl moieties to protrude inward thereby causing altered permeability and loss of essential cytosolic components. The fatty acyl components also render polyene antifungal susceptibility in yeast. Additionally, amphotericin B also acts as an oxidative load on fungal membranes thereby causing the death of C. albicans. At higher doses, polyenes also hamper the functioning of fungal chitin synthase enzyme. For the unpleasant activity of AmB, the research developed conjugated AmB with liposomes for better functioning in host and least toxicity. Some examples include Amphotec, AmBisome, etc. During liposome and AmB formulation, selective transfer method enables the AmB\u2019s transfer from donor liposome to target the membranal ergosterol facilitated by phospholipases (either pathogen or host) (Boswell et al. 1998). A formulation of liposomal nystatin and polyene Nyotran is under clinical trials for evaluation.",

Some hypotheses have led to the conclusion that initial medications with azoles can lead to amphotericin B resistance. The resistance mechanism can be either due to the category of sterol or the fungal membrane composition. In one study, cross-resistance was observed to amphotericin B in fluconazole-resistant Candida strains from HIV-infected individuals due to modulation in ergosterol synthesis (Heinic et al. 1993). The same isolates also showed cross-resistance to nystatin. Such polyene (AmB as well as nystatin) resistance has also been observed in trauma patients with compromised immune profile. The lipid complexes with AmB have the active amphotericin moiety released from tissue lipases in vivo. This confers resistance to AmB contributing to less drug efficacy but with lipid formulations; the edge shifts to increased efficacy and uptake during drug administration. An alteration in the membrane\u2019s lipid composition due to deficit ergosterol amount lowers the affinity of amphotericin B for binding to plasma membrane. However, the resistance is conferred majorly due to ergosterol and not due to altered sterol composition.

These naturally developed resistant strains produce altered sterols for binding nystatin at decreased affinity. The binding of nystatin to sterol influences cell membrane damage. With greater affinity, the membrane damage increases. Generally, the resistant strain is expected to grow slow as compared to the susceptible one. Polyene tolerance is lost after certain passages in media devoid of nystatin. However, sterol contents result in increased affinity for nystatin. So it\u2019s mutation that plays a role in tolerance development rather than selection. Polyene resistance is mostly studied using cells grown in increasing or gradient concentration of antifungals that generates mutants. The biochemical hypothesis outlines resistance to be a qualitative as well as quantitative factor of sterol content in cells. Altered sterol content decreases the binding of polyenes in resistant cells either due to complete lack of cellular ergosterol amount without associated change in overall sterol composition or by replacing the higher affinity polyene-binding sterols with less binding ones. At times steric modification or thermodynamic alteration in polyene binding can also lead to the resistance mechanism. However the major reason of tolerance due to decreased ergosterol content is not caused due to enzymatic degradation but blockage on synthetic pathway which leads to decreased polyene susceptibility. However it was reported that certain Candida strains possessed certain key sterols that enabled the resistance to polyenes (Hamilton-Miller 1972). D8 sterols possessing strains are more resistant to polyenes than the ones bearing D7 sterols.",

With an efficient penetrating capability into body fluids, 5-FC was targeted against Candida as well as C. neoformans. However, the incidence of primary resistance among fungal pathogens led to the combinational therapy of 5-FC along with other antifungal drugs like amphotericin B along with fluconazole. The cytosine permease enzyme aids the absorption of 5-FC into the fungal cells (Andriole 1999). Immediate to its entry, the compound undergoes modification to 5-fluorouracil by deaminase enzyme. This compound undergoes conversion to fluorouridine triphosphate by UMP pyrophosphorylase which after further phosphorylation is incorporated into the fungal RNA chain, thereby blocking the protein synthesis. Fluorouracil also undergoes conversion to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate which disrupts with the functioning of thymidylate synthase, which aids in DNA synthesis. Thereby, 5-FC disrupts with DNA, RNA, as well as protein synthesis of pathogen cell. The resistance mechanism have been widely investigated and hence have related the disrupted functioning of the enzyme cytosine permease or deaminase (which enables two consecutive absorption and conversion steps of 5-FC) to diminished drug uptake by fungal cells. This is due to a mutational change that not only promotes primary but also intrinsic resistance. Secondly, less catalytic activity of uridine monophosphate pyrophosphorylase and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase also confers 5-FC resistance in C. albicans. Both cytosine deaminase and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase are involved in the pyrimidine salvage pathway and are unessential for de novo synthesis. A change in the bases due to mutation in either one of these salvage pathway enzymes confers resistance in C. albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. In C. albicans, less phosphoribosyltransferase activity was linked to 5-FC resistance in a dose-dependent manner. Resistance to 5-FC due to decreased uptake has been well observed in S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata (Vandevelde et al. 1972). However, this mechanism is not of significance in C. albicans or Cryptococcus neoformans.",

These compounds have selective toxicity benefits in host. The medically important pathogen C. albicans has a multilayered cell wall comprising of \u03b2-glucan and mannoprotein (80 % of cell mass) along with chitin. Among the glucan synthesis inhibitors, chitin biosynthetic genes are disrupted by compounds named as nikkomycins which have been scientifically investigated for commercial use. The three groups categorized as glucan synthesis inhibitors are aculeacins, echinocandins, and papulacandins which disrupt the functioning of \u03b2-(1,3)-glucan synthetase enzyme that leads to synthesis of 1,3-\u03b2, d-glucan. However among the inhibitors, the lipoproteins, i.e., echinocandins, are clinically approved for global use due to their safety, efficacy, and tolerance level. Echinocandins are tested to be potently active against Candida spp., Aspergillus strains, dimorphic molds, and Pneumocystis carinii. Three antimycotic compounds under echinocandins have been thoroughly investigated for safe use, namely, caspofungin, FK-463, and VER-002. No cross-resistance was observed against these three compounds in isolates resistant to triazoles. These inhibitors form a noncompetitive inhibition with secondary effects on either the chitin content or ergosterol content of fungal cell. One study reported the in vitro comparative activity analysis of echinocandin in fluconazole-resistant Candida strains with itraconazole and amphotericin B as test parameters (Cuenca-Estrella et al. 2000). The results showed echinocandin to have potent activity against a range of Candida spp. like C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, etc. However, echinocandins showed to have less activity against C. parapsilosis and C. guilliermondii. Nevertheless, in C. neoformans, the reduced activity of echinocandins is due to decreased fungal glucan synthase activity (Maligie and Selitrennikoff 2005). The resistance mechanism of pathogens against echinocandin is very limited. Kurtz and Douglas experimented with the laboratory-resistant mutants of S. cerevisiae. Echinocandins target the \u03b2-glucan synthase enzyme which is mainly encoded by two genes called FKS1 and RHO1 and regulated by a third gene (Sekiya-Kawasaki et al. 2002). FKS2 is another gene in S. cerevisiae which is homologous to FKS1. Any base alteration in FKS1 genetically causing mutations leads to the development of in vitro resistance to echinocandins (Balashov et al. 2006). This is specifically due to the alteration of the target enzyme, glucan synthase. Some sort of resistance is also developed due to mutations in GNS1 gene coding for fatty acid chain synthesis in cell wall. Conversely, changes in FKS2 gene does not attribute to resistance. The resistance mechanisms for azoles include efflux pumps and fungal membrane composition, which howsoever seems inappropriate for echinocandins as they don\u2019t undergo cytosolic pathway of penetration. Since they don\u2019t traverse the fungal membrane barrier, the entry mechanisms don\u2019t serve as the methods of resistance development in lipopeptides. Even MDR-like gene activation doesn\u2019t confer resistance mechanism to echinocandins. These results finally conclude that FKS1 mutation can alter the protein forming the catalytic target of glucan synthase enzyme, thereby facilitating lipopeptide resistance development in S. cerevisiae. Lastly, a study established that both S. cerevisiae and C. albicans have similar mechanism of resistance to \u03b2-glucan synthase inhibitors (Douglas et al. 1994).",

The drug-resistant strains showed point mutations in a recognized second reading frame of the M segment of the influenza RNA genome. This region, named as M2 encodes for a tetrameric, transmembrane H+ ion channel, required for pH mediated entry of the viral ribonucleoprotein into the cytoplasm. Amantadines used to block this channel, hence preventing viral replication. Early experiments with viral neuraminidase inhibitory drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir showed sensitivity toward both influenza A and B viruses, but recent reports show incidence of higher resistance for oseltamivir than zanamivir. A seasonal influenza H1N1 virus found to be mutated in its neuraminidase gene (H274Y) and thus contribute for developing resistance against oseltamivir (Control and Prevention 2009).

Drug-resistant acyclovir was first encountered as early as in the year 1982 when the drug was systemically circulated, but later drug-resistant strains have been isolated from patients without any history of preexposure to the drug (Nugier et al. 1992). Resistance of HSV to acyclovir is often associated with the viral TK or DNA polymerase mutations (Morfin and Thouvenot 2003). This mutation can lead to a loss of TK function or a modification in TK substrate specificity. Mutations in the TK gene are mainly due to addition or deletion of nucleotides in homopolymer runs of guanines and cytosines, resulting in frame shifting and loss of its function. Drug-resistant TK mutants retain susceptibility to drugs like foscarnet and cidofovir that are independent of viral-mediated phosphorylation, unless a viral DNA polymerase mutation is also present. Given the essential role of DNA polymerase in viral replication, mutations in this gene occur less frequently and have been found to cluster in functional domains II and III.",

But shortly after the introduction of ganciclovir in the late 1980s, cases of drug resistance came into picture (Akalin et al. 2003). On prolonged exposure to ganciclovir, 90 % of resistant CMV isolates were found to have characteristic mutations in the viral UL97 kinase gene (Chou 2008). These mutations apparently reduce the ganciclovir phosphorylation without impairing the major functions of the kinase in viral replication. CMV UL97 drug resistance mutations cluster tightly at codons 460, 520, and 590\u2013607. Mutations M460V/I, H520Q, C592G, A594V, L595S, and C603W are among the most frequently encountered in ganciclovir-resistant isolates. Apart from this, CMV UL54 DNA polymerase mutations can lead to resistance against almost all the available drugs for CMV infection. Many ganciclovir resistance mutations are located in the exonuclease domains and typically confer cross-resistance to cidofovir whereas mutations in and between the catalytic domains can contribute to foscarnet resistance as well as cross-resistance in cidofovir and ganciclovir in a low grade.

All of these target HBV DNA polymerase, which includes reverse transcriptase activity. These kinds of drugs are phosphorylated by cellular enzymes to active form and then incorporated into growing DNA, resulting in premature chain termination, among other inhibitory functions associated with viral replication. Due to the high viral replication rate and the error-prone nature of HBV reverse transcriptase, there has been the emergence of resistance against the above said classes of drugs. Reports suggest that signature mutations in the reverse transcriptase domains of the viral polymerase gene are the main causes of drug resistance as it changes the interaction between the virus and drugs. High-level lamivudine resistance is mostly caused by M204I/V mutations, which are in the YMDD (tyrosine\u2013methionine\u2013aspartate\u2013aspartate) motif in the C domain of the polymerase gene and infrequently by A181V/T mutations. The M204I mutation confers high-level cross-resistance to telbivudine, either alone or in association with the secondary mutations L80I/V or L180M. The N236T mutation, on the other hand, decreases viral replicative capacity in vitro and provides cross-resistance to tenofovir but not to lamivudine or telbivudine. During continued entecavir treatment, additional mutations at I169T and M250V or T184G and S202I are selected, conferring resistance to the same. Report on tenofovir resistance has been seen in two HBV/HIV co-infected patients with prior lamivudine exposure (L180M/M204V mutations) and an extra A194T mutation (Lacombe et al. 2010).",

Despite of continuous research and anti-HIV drug development, no combination of drug studied till date has shown to completely block viral replication. Instead, the virus has developed smart mutations in its different survival pathways and continues to be a threat to mankind. Antiretroviral drugs are either nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), or protease inhibitors. Two important mechanisms by which NRTIs work involve mutations (e.g., M184V, K65R, Q151M) occurring at or near the drug-binding site of the reverse transcriptase gene, leading to increased drug discrimination by this gene, and another way is to make key mutations that actually work to undo the action of the drugs, even if they bind to their target RT correctly (Clavel and Hance 2004). NRTIs behave like plugs by blocking nonextendable nucleoside analog monophosphate to the 3\u2032 end of the growing proviral DNA chain, thus inhibiting viral replication. But this phenomenon can be reversed by a reverse transcriptase reaction where the chain-terminating residue is removed and an extendable primer is reinstated. This kind of reverse reaction of DNA polymerization is called pyrophosphorolysis, and it enables reverse transcription and DNA synthesis to resume. This mechanism can be enhanced by some mutations, mostly those selected by zidovudine (Retrovir) and stavudine. As these two drugs are thymidine analogs, these mutations are often referred to as thymidine analog mutations (TAMs).",

Different mutations conferring resistance to NNRTIs like L100I, Y181C, G190S/A, and M230I involve the amino acids that form the hydrophobic binding pocket.

These proteases cleave the polyproteins immediately after or during the budding process at nine different positions to give rise to various structural proteins (p17, p24, p7, and p6), reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease. All the available protease inhibitors bind to the active site amino acids at the center of the homodimer and prevent cleavage of gag and gag-pol protein precursors in severely infected cells.

            "text": "The emergence of antiparasitic drug resistance has transformed the global epidemiology profile. Drug dosage and pharmacodynamic properties affect the efficiency of any therapeutic regime. The resistance emergence generally initiates with a genetic change followed by a selection process offering the parasite an endurance profile within host for its survival. Parasitic treatment failures depend on the host immune system as well as parasitic factor. Drug dosage, administration frequency, the period of transition from susceptible to resistant form, time point of host infection, and the fitness cost effects influence the resistance transmission. Acquired tolerance, cross-resistance, drug adherence, and absorption features lead to parasite recrudescence. Cross-resistance is a factor which complicates the administration of different classes of antiparasitic compounds with varied modes of action which are rendered futile due to superbug tolerance mechanisms. The aminoquinolines and antifolates are mostly affected. In malaria, for instance, the non-clearance of asexual parasites leads to gametocyte assembly which transmits resistance determinants. The resistance development occurs in two phases of tolerance emergence and spread (Klein 2013). Initially a rare, random, and spontaneous genetic mutation provides the parasite a survival advantage which later gets selective, replicates, and becomes insusceptible to treatment. Other than chromosomal mutations, even the gene copies influence the drug target alteration or efflux of therapeutics. A single de novo mutation can lead to multiple events; however, non-immune individuals acting as parasite reservoirs can even contribute to de novo tolerance. Selection of the resistant parasites occurs due to subtherapeutic drug concentration exposure where the sensitive lot succumbs and leads to the drug resistance spread. The time frame for selection and resistance transmission of parasites portrays the \u201cfitness cost\u201d which enables subsequent gametocyte production and cessation of drug activity. The major factors for emergence and spread of antiparasitic drug resistance include the intrinsic frequency of the parasitic genetic mutation, the fitness cost of tolerance, the drug selection pressure, drug pharmacokinetic properties and dosage, host immune profile, and transmission profile. There is a list of extrinsic as well as intrinsic factors that contribute to the emergence of resistance. Access and availability of drugs due to economical hindrances, distribution statistics, and reluctance of usage are the general factors of reduced remedial aid. Additionally, complex antimalarial drug regimes are being self-prescribed by individuals with the threat of inadequate adherence. Unregulated pharmaceutical trade can lead to the commercialization and use of counterfeit antiparasitic drugs. Other than the above mentioned extrinsic factors, the intrinsic elements include parasite\u2019s cellular, molecular, and clinical features, their species-based innate resistance, drug activity spectrum, and drug response to parasite\u2019s stage susceptibility. All these influence drug resistance in the presence of complete therapeutic adherence. Among parasites, the malarial infections are symptomatic and thereby the individuals develop partial immune response (premunition) against these bugs which keeps a check on the resistance spread. Infection-based immune response selectively eliminates the blood parasites including the de novo resistant strains. The immune status of individuals infected with parasite hereby affects the drug efficiency level. Among the drugs, amphotericin B is the most widely used treatment against leishmaniasis. But the developed resistance is species dependent. The vector control and effective case management hence will enable a check on parasitic diseases.",

Innumerable factors like parasitic behavioral, metabolic, and molecular attributes influence the drug effects, and even the drug\u2019s pharmacokinetic properties affect the pathogen\u2019s response to subtherapeutic treatment levels. The degree of absorption and distribution links the drug\u2019s bioavailability within host. The therapeutic ratio and oral bioavailability influences the emergence of resistance. The extended half-life during the drug\u2019s elimination phase increases the chances of parasitic encounter with selective drug concentrations. For instance, as chloroquine resistance augments, the drug elimination phase gathers insufficient drug amounts, which decreases the selective nature of tolerance. However, prolonged drug exposure extends the selective capacity of parasites in host blood system. The transmission again depends on the host immune profile, drug exposure, parasite duplication profile, and host intracellular processes which influence drug-sensitive pathogens. Repeated drug exposure and parasite subpopulation can contribute to drug resistance. The bar of sensitive parasitic MIC if raised will cause a decrease in the susceptible as well as the selective resistant generations. The balance between de novo resistance and drug elimination phase imposes a discriminatory filter for resistance development and susceptibility inhibition. This selection gives an edge for tolerance in parasites highlighting the elimination phase to be instrumental in conferring antiparasitic resistance. The major challenge is the failure in surpassing phase II clinical trials for antiparasitic drugs. The drug synthesis is economically viable and isn\u2019t driven by commercial requirements. Yet the detailed insight into the genomics profile for unraveling the translational formulations for novel drug discovery is still a challenge.

Monitoring the therapeutic resistance by investigating into pathogen\u2019s phenotypic susceptibility and cellular and molecular alterations in response to drug and developing molecular probes for limiting tolerance can be one of the strategies for refining the present approaches (Pink et al. 2005). The cost and supply of drugs, the diagnostic methodology, and the design of combinatorial therapies can enhance the efficacy of antiparasitic treatments. The combinations are designed in formulations for increased spectrum of activity with either synergistic or additive effect, reduced toxicity, and dosage requirement and prevention of resistance, for instance, combinations like eflornithine and melarsoprol for trypanosomiasis. The combinational therapy works best for combating parasitic infections particularly malaria. Two or more drugs with identical pharmacokinetic properties and different modes of action can slacken the resistance development. Mostly artemisinin derivatives are potent combinatorial medications against malaria due to their pathogen-killing efficiency, reduced toxic effects, and preventive drug resistance features. In combination with mefloquine, artemisinin leaves the mefloquine \u201ctail\u201d unshielded. This drug \u201ctail\u201d eradication phase edges the sieve for resistance emergence.

Additionally, parasite doubling and survival have a greater impact and drug targets can inhibit the further disease progression. Antimalarial drug formulations have also employed resistance reverser mechanism. Another approach will involve refining the conventional drugs for broadening the spectrum of drug action. Such indication for therapeutics had been observed in pneumonia medication, DB289, which is now being clinically tested for malaria as well as African trypanosomiasis (Legros et al. 2002). However, the reluctance of companies to experiment with the risk of testing and toxicity remains an economic challenge. Other strategies involve modulation in drug design for better functioning, like in the case of malarial drugs pyrimethamine whose analogs are being developed to surmount dihydrofolate reductase chromosomal mutations. Antimalarial drug ferroquine bears a chloroquine-like nucleus but with an altered side chain ferrocenic group which lights up its excellent antiparasitic activity against resistant strains (Biot et al. 2005). In vitro tests and molecular approaches ease the parasitic drug monitoring and validation of their therapeutic profile. Chloroquine resistance has been experimented nowadays for producing agents for resistance reversal. Still opportunities for new targets and renewed treatments are being sorted out in the research world today for a ray of anticipation and optimism to combat drug resistance.",

With greater clinical menace, \u03b2-lactamase-producing strains were targeted for the hydrolase enzyme by mechanistic-oriented inhibition.

Modulation of tetracycline and erythromycin structures with alteration in their efflux pump strategies would be appropriate antibacterial therapy. Augmentin is under experimentation with certain additive changes of efflux pump inhibition in combination with macrolides or tetracycline. Even certain semisynthetic analogs of vancomycin have been designed for effective activity against vancomycin-resistant strains. The analogs comprise of a vancosamine biphenyl sugar moiety substitution with higher hydrophobicity and more membrane-oriented and greater activity inhibition between transpeptidases and transglycosylases.

Many of the functions of these efflux pumps target the release of internal cellular constituents instead of securing the cell from exogenous toxins. Elucidation of substrate recognition mechanism by efflux transporters is still a challenging aspect. Basically the DNA array technique for detection of co-regulated genes with efflux systems in induced strains can explicate the functioning of such pumping machinery (Card et al. 2013, 2014). Secondly, certain genetic alterations of mutant generation can result in the accumulation of intracellular metabolites, thereby leading to the functional annotation of many transporters.

These tests don\u2019t consider host factors to puzzle with the outcome which makes them different from therapeutic efficacy protocols. Most importantly, multiple sample tests can be experimented with a range of drug concentrations against the microbes/parasites.

Data presentation in geometric means scales rather percentage profile can solve the issue of standard protocol requirement. In comparison to therapeutic studies, the outcomes are mostly inconsistent due to lack of a stringent protocol and limitation in monitoring the resistance threshold.

The major genetic alterations responsible for microbial tolerance once identified can be validated and explained with molecular approach. Serving advantageous over other methods, molecular biology experiments can involve greater sample numbers for detection or analysis within restricted time period and the ease of sample storage and transportation as compared to in vitro tests. The genes potentially involved in conferring resistance to drugs after being detected needs to be screened for identification of the molecular markers. Any point mutation at the targeted gene strengthens the pathogen\u2019s tolerance level to therapeutics. The greater the frequency and the higher the number of mutational changes, the greater the degree of resistance. For instance, the parasitic dihydrofolate reductase gene is instrumental in contributing to resistance to antimalarial drugs. Sulfadoxine resistance is conferred due to five specific mutations in dihydrofolate reductase gene (Sharma et al. 2015). Higher degree of resistance is contributed due to genetic alterations at three specific positions of 436, 581, and 613, whereas the other positions 437 and 540 add to some amount of parasitic tolerance. The genetic composition of the microbe and the drug response is controlled by many microbial and host factors including drug pharmacokinetic properties. Cumulative genetic modifications forming variant mutants can also influence pathogen clearance and spread of resistance. Increased copy numbers can even attribute to resistance features in pathogens which hampers medication. Several transporter genes encoding putative sodium hydrogen exchange pumps are associated with low drug response. Molecular detection of drug efficacy provides an early indication for geographical monitoring. Such molecular biology methods are essential for detecting the frequency of mutations with drug introduction or withdrawal. Certain drugs bearing technical difficulties of solubility and suspension can be easily tested with such molecular approach. Molecular markers are a direct predictive approach to test the drug efficacy or therapeutic failures that might have led to the selective emergence of resistant species. However, challenges on method sensitivity still continue to persist due to rising mixed pathogen infections in widespread areas. The tests if sensitive will prevent the camouflage of resistant species and avoid discordant outcomes. Due to high consistency in this approach, greater collaborations between research wings and national programmes are being encouraged.",

Intracellular drug absorption, its interaction, host metabolism of drug, and its elimination from the body will influence the dosage of the medication in accordance to its pharmacokinetic properties. The decision of the drug dosage will be required for enabling proper adaptation to the diversified population. For instance, in antimalarial treatment, the poor host absorption property gives rise to variant blood concentrations as the pharmacodynamic features of the drug vary universally. Majorly monitoring the drug efficacy requires consideration of the success rate of the drug or the treatment failures either due to improper dosage or arising microbial resistance strategy. During treatment failure, the drug amount might be slightly less than the MIC of the proliferating superbugs. A lower therapeutic agent dose implies reappearance of the sensitive pathogen after removal of the administered drug with certain drug modulations. Such situations form the argumentative base of microbial resistance mechanism. The drug dosage thereby becomes a very crucial factor for influencing the pharmacological population kinetics of drug variability. Together with such features, certain software modules can formulate these pharmacokinetic attributes and drug characteristic differences to understand interindividual disparity. For assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations, research on the drug properties should be intense for further in vivo evaluation. Simple assay method protocols are developed for an approximation of drug exposure. This initiates national control programmes for monitoring the therapeutic agent effectiveness into a routine wide-scale schedule.

Such microbial immunomodulatory pathogenic components enable efficient sustenance within host. These defined pooled down targets responsible for forming the pathogen\u2019s survival weaponry once optimized can form a database for automated screening and assessment of inhibitors. The hits of the protein targets can be validated for specificity and efficacy. These hits after validation and optimization can undergo in vitro screening process in cell lines followed up by in vivo mechanistic studies. Such strategies offer significant and secured targets for antibiotic generation. Many examples bring up such bioinformatics analysis (Gautam et al. 2016) followed by wet lab validation for greater success rates of drug development. The famous bacterial metallopeptidase, i.e., peptide deformylase, is the sweet target of many potent drugs which mainly blocks the formyl group transfer (Kumari et al. 2013). The major virulence determinants of microbes that are mostly being screened and targeted for drug development involve the secretion system and the signaling cascade mechanism. The bacterial secretion system forms an injection system that punctures into the membrane barrier for transport of virulence proteins modulating with host functioning. The signaling pathway mainly targets either the two-component network system comprising of a sensor kinase and regulatory transcriptional factor or the quorum sensing mechanism involving differential gene expression in conditional responses.

An inevitable interplay between resistance and discovery brings in new challenges either to preserve the efficacy of the present therapeutics or to expand the life of such drugs. This explicit approach had to be central to the present era of resistant bacterial havoc. A check has been imposed for considerate drug prescription for the patients as well as for physicians. Inappropriate and unnecessary antibiotic prescription in developed countries can lead to intermittent therapeutic availability, uncertain effectiveness due to regular use, or chances of self-medication leading to worse consequences. Generally subtherapeutic drug dosage can lead to inhabitation of certain bacterial strains at their dormancy state which cause acute complications during medical crisis. At this juncture, the resistance proves dominant over the infection mechanism. So the major issues are with the carriers of dormant infective strains termed as reservoirs. To conserve the efficacy of drugs as the final resort, a rotation principle of antibiotic usage was implied which led to a devastating scenario in the occurrence of vancomycin-resistant MRSA. Not only swap and switch principle but also combinational primary medications have been approved for life-threatening infections where two units work for neutralizing a specific target, but mixture of variant classes target different activities concomitantly. Examples are Augmentin and Synercid specifically. This combinatorial strategy is a standard approach for anticancer regimes and even for antiretroviral therapy to control cancer and AIDS progression. However, the likelihood of emergence of microbial multidrug tolerance increases. Major cases of drug resistance arise during the extended tenure of treatment therapy (McNairy et al. 2013). Previously there have been reports for widespread use of antibiotics as growth promoters in cattle feed. This results in cross-resistance between different host systems which further reduces the antibiotic life span. A study reported the usage of 1000-fold higher vancomycin for human infections when a vancomycin derivative avoparcin was used for animals in the same year (Walsh 2000). When the Enterococcus isolates from those animals were screened, similar five operons encoding for vancomycin resistance were found as in the non-infected human carriers. This led to a complete ban of avoparcin. Similar cases have also been reported due to tolerance mechanism of Enterococcus against quinupristin/dalfopristin therapy. This resistance was mostly developed due to the use of virginiamycin in Europe in cattle feed since two decades which led to acetyl transferase effect in animal carriers (Walsh 2000). From then, stringency was employed in the approval and usage of antibacterial compounds in cattle feed. The \u201cwaste\u201d in feed would cause \u201chaste\u201d in drug development for deteriorating human health. Overall, the modern molecular and high-throughput approaches can enable screening of microbial genes for candidate targets forming the library of novel synthetic and natural molecules that can be experimented and formulated structurally for better functioning. This will crave new genera of modern antibiotics having effective broad-spectrum activity against the conventional ones. The new age antibiotics will however not hamper the resistance cycle, but haphazard use can affect behavioral changes which would be difficult in achieving with regard to antibiotic value.",

Their primary mode of action against microbes designates their classification as antifungals against fungi or antibiotics against bacteria.\nPharmacokinetics deals with the fate of the drugs after administration within host system. The kinetics of drugs, their absorption, localization, distribution, metabolism, and elimination are the processes studied in pharmacokinetics.\nAntibiotics are medications used to treat bacterial infections, hence termed as antibacterials, for example, penicillins, cephalosporins, etc.\nAntimicrobial susceptibility defines the sensitivity of a particular bacterium or fungus to the dosage of antimicrobial agent thereby affecting the pathogen\u2019s growth or survivability.\n",
