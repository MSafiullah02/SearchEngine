The expanding use of social media has the potential to leverage the early identification of mental health diseases. As data gathered via social media are already digital, they have the ability to power up faster automatic analysis. In this article we evaluate the impact that psycholinguistic patterns can have on a standard machine learning approach for classifying depressed users based on their writings in an online public forum. We combine psycholinguistic features in a rule-based estimator and we evaluate their impact on this classification problem, along with three other standard classifiers. Our results on the Reddit Self-reported Depression Diagnosis dataset outperform some previously reported works on the same dataset. They stand for the importance of extracting psychologically motivated features when processing social media texts with the purpose of studying mental health.",

This attracted the attention of natural language processing researchers. Among them, those who study the language of individuals in relation to their mental health conditions. Social media data has been identified as an emerging opportunity for revolutionizing in-the-moment measures of a broad range of people's thoughts and feelings [16] . Several studies focusing on mental health understanding through social network data have been conducted using Twitter 1 texts. Coppersmith et al. [9] presented a method for gathering data for a range of mental illnesses along with proof-of-concept results that focus on the analysis of four mental disorders: post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, and seasonal affective disorder. Their ultimate goal was to enable the ethical discussion regarding the balance between the utility of such data and the privacy of mental health related information. Later on, Coppersmith et al. [10] released a Twitter dataset of users who have attempted suicide, matched by neurotypical control users. Language modeling techniques were employed to classify these users, along with open government data to identify quantifiable signals that can relate them to psychometrically validated concepts associated to suicide. Nadeem et al. [18] used the same dataset to predict Major Depressive Disorder among online personas based on a Bag of Words approach and several statistical classifiers. More recently, Vioul\u00e8s et al. [24] combined natural language processing features with a martingale framework to detect Twitter posts containing suicide-related content. The results were comparable to traditional machine learning classifiers.",

De Choudhury et al. [13] applied a logistic regression classifier that led to high accuracy results in order to predict suicidal ideation in Reddit users.

A recent study on absolutist thinking, which is considered a cognitive distortion by most cognitive therapies for anxiety and depression, showed that anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation forums contained more absolutist words than control forums [3] . The study, conducted as a text analysis of 63 Internet forums with over 6400 members resulted in a validation of an absolutist words dictionary, presented in Table 1 . Their usage frequency was considered for the rule-based estimator. Analysis of Lexical Categories. Depressed users frequently use negative emotion words and anger words on social networks [12, 19] . Empath [14] is a text categorization open-source software that analyzes text across 200 built-in, prevalidated categories that were generated from common topics in a web dataset. Empath's categories have been human validated and are highly correlated (r = 0.906) with similar categories in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count [21] . As depressed users tend to have an overall more negative connotation of their texts, we used Empath's lexical category (version release 0.41) of a user's overall set of posts for the rule based estimator.",

Apart from assessing each model separately, we considered a feature union of equal weights for tf-idf and the output of the rule-based estimator, combined with a Passive Aggressive classifier. We achieve the best results in terms of precision when using tf-idf weighting with a Passive Aggressive classifier. One explanation for this result may reside in the fact that the Passive Aggressive classifier is an online classifier that learns sequentially. Batch training led to better results for SGD and PA. We believe this happens because the models are being updated along the way and are less prone to overfit. When taking into account the psycholinguistic features we manage to improve the results in terms of recall, while not losing too much precision.",
