It has been found that the pandemic has also affected the content explored by the internet users (Effenberger et al., 2020), as the Internet is an important source of information (Berger et al., 2005). Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether changes in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths are associated with RSV of contents associated with mental health.",

Pooled data analysis confirmed these findings for the number of COVID-19 deaths (Table 1, Supplementary Figures 7 and 8).

However, in four countries (Australia, Canada, China, and the UK), an inverse relationship was shown. Interestingly, these are countries that differ in the incidence of a generalized anxiety disorder (lifetime prevalence of DSM-5 anxiety - 8% in Australia vs. 1% in China) (Ruscio et al., 2017). Similarly, we found a positive correlation between the RSV for \u201cinsomnia\u201d and the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in some countries. Less PTSD symptoms were observed among Wuhan residents during the COVID-19 outbreak who declared better sleep quality (Liu et al., 2020). Despite the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, each of countries included in our analysis is at a different stage of the pandemic. In countries with stable epidemiological situation, we can expect different emotional responses. In addition, an important issue can be related to the sense of security provided by specific governments.",

Moreover, the RSV indexes for \u201csuicide\u201d in 2020 and 2019 were not significantly correlated in neither of countries, and thus seasonal changes in suicide rates are unlikely to account for this observation. Lower suicide rates were also observed during 180 days following terrorist attacks in the USA on September 11, 2001 (Claassen et al., 2010). These findings suggest that in the proximity of life-threatening events, individuals might first consider protecting the most important aspects of their lives and change personal views on health and mortality. This may be associated with the phenomenon of resilience. Moreover, it is likely that a decrease in RSV indexes for \u201csuicide\u201d and \u201cdepression\u201d is the consequence of increased social cohesion during the pandemic (Reger et al., 2020), based on the use of adaptive coping strategies. Moreover, intercultural differences should be taken into account in understanding these observations.",
