Most institutions often have only a minimal number of reserve ventilators on site at any time. When all of the full-feature hospital ventilators are occupied, additional units are usually rented from a vendor. A study by Kaji and Lewis47 in Los Angeles found that 71% of hospitals in the Los Angeles area had fewer than six ventilators available for immediate use at any time. If several local hospitals require additional ventilators, rental supplies may be insufficient to meet need, as it is common for vendors to contract to provide the same finite pool of ventilators to several institutions.",

This predicted available national mechanical ventilator quantity may at first seem reassuring, but it also has potential to mislead. Numerous logistic hurdles will hamper immediate distribution to areas of need during a disaster. Thousands of ventilators may be available at hospitals nationwide, yet an affected community requiring just hundreds of additional devices may not be able to get them in a timely manner. Also, published and unpublished models of varying sophistication portend there will still be a large gap between the total number of ventilators required during the peak of a serious influenza pandemic and available devices.23\n49\n50\n51 In all models, the predicted need will far exceed even the tens of thousands of available ventilators.

This cost does not take into account the cost of the financing to purchase the stockpile or the potential returns from alternative investments those funds could be used for. This considerable expense also does not include the cost of maintaining and storing equipment. Furthermore, the period of treatment being considered is very short and not representative of the typical length of ICU stay. Thus the cost is substantial, imposing significant fiscal limitations on the ability to stockpile.

However, this is often difficult to do during a disaster when ambulances are occupied with the ongoing prehospital response. Moreover, most areas will not have a sufficient number of dedicated critical care transport teams to evacuate large numbers of critically ill; thus, regular critical care staff would be required. This would take critical care staff away from the hospital during transport and would be an inefficient use of valuable staff (ie, 2:1 or 3:1 registered nurse/respiratory technician/medical doctor-to-patient ratio).",

Civilian ground, aeromedical rotor-wing, and fixed-wing assets may assist, if not dedicated to the on-scene major incident response, but the total number of aircraft in the United States is limited (eg, 800 civilian rotor-wing aircraft),78 and all are designed for the transport of one to two critically ill patients at a time.
