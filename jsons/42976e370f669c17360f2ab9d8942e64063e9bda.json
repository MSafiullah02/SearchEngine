The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy, safety, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of interferon alfa (IFN-\u2423) alone or in combination with oral amantadine for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. One hundred nineteen previously untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C were randomly allocated to treatment with IFN-\u24232a at a dose of 6 megaunits 3 times a week subcutaneously for 24 weeks, followed by 3 megaunits thrice weekly for an additional 24 weeks plus amantadine sulphate administered orally 100 mg twice a day for 48 weeks or the same IFN regimen plus a matched placebo. The primary endpoint was undectable serum HCV RNA (<1,000 copies/mL) at week 24 after treatment. At the end of treatment and the 24-week follow-up period serum HCV RNA was undetectable in 20 (34%) and 6 (10%) of the 59 patients treated with the combination IFN-\u2423 plus amantadine and in 20 (33%) and 13 (22%) of the 60 patients treated with IFN-\u2423 alone, respectively (P \u202b\u060d\u202c n.s.). Discontinuation of therapy for adverse events was similar in both treatment groups. Although treatment with IFN-\u2423 worsened HRQOL, combination with amantadine showed a substantial trend to improve fatigue and vigor. In conclusion, combination therapy IFN-\u2423 plus amantadine is as effective as IFN-\u2423 monotherapy in previously untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C. (HEPATOLOGY 2000;32:835-841.)",

Further exclusion criteria were pregnancy and lactation period. Study Design. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted at the university hospitals of Berlin and Frankfurt, Germany. The patients were assigned to treatment with either the combination of IFN-\u24232a plus amantadine sulphate or IFN-\u24232a plus placebo. Randomization was performed with a random number generator in fixed blocks of 4 with a ratio of 1:1. All patients received IFN-\u24232a (Roferon A; Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany) at a dose of 6 megaunits 3 times per week subcutaneously for 24 weeks, followed by 3 megaunits 3 times per week for an additional 24 weeks. Amantadine sulphate (Infex; Merz \u03e9 Co. GmbH Co., Frankfurt a.M., Germany) or a matched placebo was administered orally twice a day with a total dose of 200 mg for 48 weeks. Treatment was prematurely discontinued in patients with detectable HCV RNA 20 weeks after initiation of therapy. The study was approved by the ethics committees at the participating centers and performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki, the German Drug Law, and the ICH/CPMP guidelines \"Good Clinical Practice.\" All patients gave written informed consent before enrollment.",

The lower detection limit of the qualitative assay is 1,000 copies/mL. 18 Genotyping of HCV was performed by reverse hybridization assay (Inno LiPA HCV II; Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium). 19 A second liver biopsy was scheduled at the end of the 24-week follow-up period.",

Emotional and psychologic states were measured at baseline, at weeks 24 and 48 of treatment, and at the end of the 24-week follow-up period by a German adapted and validated \"Profile of Mood States scale,\" which measures 4 factor scores for depression, fatigue, vigor, and anger. 20, 21 Furthermore, quality of life was assessed at the same time points by the \"Everyday Life\" questionnaire (EDLQ), a German validated questionnaire related to the SF-36 Health Survey. 22, 23 The EDLQ assesses the following 6 subscales of the HRQOL or subjective health: body (e.g., make demands on body, concentrate on a task); mind (e.g., cope with illness, accept oneself); everyday life (e.g., solve daily problems, perform personal hygiene); social activity (e.g., get along with family, count on partner's help); zest of life (e.g., enjoy life); and medical treatment (e.g., believe in success of treatment). 23 For every patient a sum score of all items of the subscale was used; missing items were replaced by the mean of the nonmissing items of the subscales. However, missing questionnaires were not replaced. Study End Points. The primary efficacy endpoint for this study was defined as undetectable serum HCV RNA levels 24 weeks after treatment. Patients who did not have a week-24 follow-up assessment for serum HCV RNA were classified as nonresponders in the analysis. Secondary efficacy parameters were the virologic response during and at the end of treatment. As additional secondary endpoints, biochemical and histologic responses were analyzed as well as changes in adverse event load and HRQOL. Liver biopsy specimens were assessed by an experienced pathologist who was unaware of clinical and biochemical data as well as of treatment regimen and response. Histologic results were classified according to internationally standardized criteria. 24 Statistical Analysis. The required number of patients was estimated as n \u03ed 120 (60 in each group). The sample size estimation was based on a type I error rate of \u2423 \u03ed .05 and a type II error rate of \u2424 \u03ed .05. The sustained virologic response rate as primary end point was expected to be 40% for combination treatment with IFN-\u24232a plus amantadine and 12.5% for IFN-\u24232a monotherapy. The primary statistical analysis of efficacy data is based on the intention-to-treat population of 119 patients, who were randomly assigned to treatment and received at least one dose of medication. The differences between virologic response rates were tested with a one-tailed Fisher exact test on a significance level of \u2423 \u03ed .05. Analysis of biochemical response rates was performed by two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test (\u2423 \u03ed .05). All tests, except those for HRQOL, were done by SAS procedures (version 6.12, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). For HRQOL analysis, the differences of sum scores at weeks 24 and 48 during treatment and week 24 after treatment to baseline were tested by Wilcoxon rank sum test using StatXact4 (Cytel Software Corp, Cambridge, MA).",

            "text": "At the beginning of infection many viruses are taken into endosomes, where their fusion glycoproteins are activated at low pH to fuse virus and endosomal membranes, allowing the genome-transcriptase complex to enter the cell. Later, newly synthesized fusion glycoproteins and other virus membrane proteins are transported to the cell surface through the acidic trans-Golgi. Evidence suggests that the M2 protein of the influenza A virus functions as a channel in 2 stages: initially as a virus membrane component, which allows acidification of the virus core; subsequently as a trans-Golgi membrane component, which relieves the pH gradient in this compartment. By blocking M2 protein function, amantadine inhibits virion core disassembly and maintains the trans-Golgi at its normally low pH. 25 The molecular mechanisms of amantadine against other viruses are less well defined. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Because of the lack of appropriate in vitro models, potential (pH-dependent) mechanisms of HCV entry into cells, replication, and processing are largely unknown. Preliminary studies suggested that amantadine inhibits dose-dependently HCV RNA content in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells from hepatitis C virus infected patients. 26 Recently, Smith 14 reported promising results in a small cohort of HCV-infected patients treated with amantadine. In this trial, 22 patients with chronic hepatitis C, who had previously failed a 24-week course of IFN-\u2423, were treated with 200 mg amantadine orally per day for 24 weeks. After a follow-up period of 24 weeks after cessation of amantadine therapy, normalization of ALT levels and reduction in HCV-RNA concentration to less than the detectable limit of the branched DNA assay (200,000 genome equivalents per mL) were observed in 6 of 22 patients (27%). 14 Similar studies also showed biochemical or biochemical and virologic effects of amantadine in patients with chronic hepatitis C. 15, 16 These results were challenged by other pilot trials showing no effect of amantadine or rimantadine on transaminase or HCV RNA levels in patients previously not responding to IFN-\u2423. 15, 27 Additional data suggested that combination therapy of chronic hepatitis C with IFN-\u2423 and amantadine may be superior to IFN-\u2423 monotherapy. 17 The present study is a double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled multicenter trial comparing the efficacy of combination therapy IFN-\u2423 plus amantadine with IFN-\u2423 monotherapy in previously untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C. The patients' characteristics were similar among groups. In both treatment groups no significantly different biochemical and virologic response rates were observed at any investigated time point during treatment and at the end of the follow-up period. Almost identical virologic response rates were observed in both groups at week 4, indicating no effect of amantadine on initial viral kinetics. Thus, amantadine did not reinforce the antiviral activity of IFN-\u2423 in patients with chronic hepatitis C.",

            "text": "The number of adverse events reported was approximately 20% less in patients treated with than without amantadine. In the \"Profile of Mood States\" scale, combination therapy IFN-\u2423 plus amantadine showed a trend to improve fatigue and vigor scores during therapy compared with patients receiving IFN-\u2423 monotherapy. Similarly, in the SF-36 Health Surveyrelated EDLQ a trend for improving HRQOL during the treatment period was observed for all subscales in patients receiving combination therapy compared with patients treated with IFN-\u2423 alone. Similar to the results of the present trial, amantadine has previously also been shown to reduce fatigue in patients with central nervous disease. 28 An open pilot study in IFN-\u2423 nonresponders showed significantly higher biochemical and virologic end-of-treatment response rates in patients treated with IFN-\u2423, ribavirin, and amantadine compared with combination treatment IFN-\u2423 and ribavirin. Six months after therapy a trend for the triple therapy remained. 29 These results were confirmed in a larger open trial of 60 IFN-\u2423 nonresponders, in which 65% and 43% of the triple therapy arm had virologic response at the end of 12-months treatment and a 6-months follow-up period, respectively, compared with 10% and 5% in the double therapy group. 30 The data of the present study do not support IFN-\u2423 synergistic antiviral activity of amantadine, and it appears unlikely that this may be modified by the addition of ribavirin. However, it is tempting to speculate that the enhanced virologic response rates observed in these triple therapy trials may be related to amantadine-induced improvement of HRQOL during treatment leading to less side effects, higher patient compliance, and better adherence to the trial regimen. Further randomized and placebo-controlled trials, including assessment of compliance and HRQOL, are required to address this hypothesis.",

However, at present, the use of amantadine to impair IFN-related side effects should not be encouraged unless further studies support efficacy and safety of the drug in this setting.",
