            "text": "Perinatal health care regionalisation of care calls for an organised neonatal retrieval service [26, 41]. The aims of a quality control programme in newborn transport are similar to those in other areas of medicine: measure the service\u2019s performance, prevent adverse events and progress to continuous improvement, amongst others [14, 15, 38]. Nevertheless, due to the intrinsic characteristics of inter-hospital transport [2], quality assessment can be challenging [24]. Moreover, many newborn transport models coexist, with variations on team composition, resources and training [22, 26, 39]. Performance measures in other areas of medicine, such as emergency medicine, critical care and neonatology, are already defined [31, 35], but consensus on the ideal indicators solely for neonatal transport lack at the moment. Scientific societies, like the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Section on Transport Medicine (SOTM), and recent guidelines [36, 41, 46] emphasise the need to measure indicators in newborn transport. To date, some studies have approached the subject [21, 32], suggesting the use of quality indicators applied to paediatric transport but not exclusive for newborns.",

A dedicated newborn transport consultant, that belongs to one of the 4 maximum newborn level hospitals with specific training in newborn critical care and transport, provides specialised medical care. The rest of health care personnel, an Intensive Care Mobile Unit (nurse and emergency driver technician) and the material resources belong to the local emergency service (SUMMA 112) and do not routinely work with newborns. Emergency driver technicians in SUMMA 112 emergency service are trained in radio communications, ambulance operations and emergency response driving skills. The transport process starts with the referring hospital demanding transport for the affected newborn. The incoming call is received at SUMMA 112 call centre, where patient data are collected and the on-duty newborn transport consultant is contacted to decide the level of care to which the patient should be transported and to provide medical advice to a referring doctor. Suitable level-of-care cot is searched. The newborn transport consultant is deployed along with the dispatch of an Intensive Care Mobile team out of the 27 that are operating everyday in Comunidad de Madrid (SUMMA 112). Both assets are coordinated to arrive separately at the referring hospital to stabilise and retrieve the patient. Stabilisation process takes place according to evidence-based algorithms. Clinical data and transport times are documented on a paper-based medical record. Adverse events are registered through a specific report system.",

Some other metrics were considered clinically relevant based on the experience acquired through the development of the specialised newborn transport programme in the last 10 years and were included because of their high frequency or their impact on the performance. Twenty-four indicators were selected suiting the principles of good quality metrics [28, 29]. Table 1 shows the definition of the quality indicators. They were classified in the six dimensions of quality suggested by the Institute of Medicine, renamed Health and Medicine Division (HMD) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [10, 38]: safety, timeliness, effectiveness, efficiency, equity and patient-centred care.

A two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Stratified analysis was performed when required. When considered relevant to quality improvement, multivariate linear or logistic regression models, where appropriate, were used to investigate associations of the events of interest with the analysed factors. Factors whose association with the indicator was significant, or close to significance (p value < 0.2), in the univariate analysis were entered in the multivariate model. Results of linear regression were expressed as regression coefficients, and results of logistic regression were expressed as odds ratios (ORs), with their 95% confidence interval (CI).

In our programme, pain perception during transport is determined by the clinician and the pharmacological sedation-analgesia is provider-driven. Pain control in pain-susceptible situations seemed more appropriate as an indicator than pain evaluation using validated tools, as the latter does not entail right management. Patient-centred indicators show internal validation with consistent values through time.

This was an indicator more prevalent in winter, probably due to bronchiolitis annual epidemic and during morning time frame because transport overlapping resulted in an increase in response time. Minimising the response time is a prime goal in any transport service [1], especially since it may have a negative effect on the patient, as shown in our study with a significant increase in adverse events. Safety events occurred, which is consistent with the published literature [24, 30, 32]. Safety events in the present study improved through time.",

The retrospective evaluation in two consecutive periods of different lengths may affect the strength of the results; the decision of the period division was made upon major internal changes that were performed in the transport protocol through the first period (2009), in order to evaluate if this affected the performance of the service. The patient\u2019s epidemiologic characteristics and main diagnosis were quite similar through the time study except for the fact that prematurity significantly descended in the second period. To adjust for this confounding factors, logistic regression and stratification was performed. The significant differences found in the quality metrics between the two periods studied may reflect an improvement (i.e. response time) or a worsening (i.e. medical device dislodgement rate) in quality of service but, due to the design and the retrospective nature of the study, it could reflect the influence of other factors or lack of registry of an indicator by transport personnel [30]. The observational nature of the study design limits the possibility of drawing robust conclusions from the data. Observational studies, though, illustrate the real daily conditions of the situation evaluated [33]: the newborn transport process.

Despite increasing international interest for improving the quality of health care, there is still a great variation in the kind of care delivered during newborn transport around the world. It is important to benchmark and compare the performance of different transport systems in order to seek for excellence, but it is also important to choose indicators adapted to the population\u2019s characteristics, newborns in this case, and suitable to assess the quality of team performance through time.
