VZV is a member of the \u03b1-herpesvirus family and is closely related to the other two human virus members of the family, herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2. Acute infection with VZV is followed by cell-associated viremia and the rash of varicella (Arvin, 2001). The virus establishes latency in the nervous system and can reactivate to cause zoster. While varicella is likely transmitted by cell-free airborne virions, in cell culture VZV is highly cell associated, and the virus is propagated by cell-to-cell spread with no infectious virus present in the medium. The virus is thought to spread within the body by cell-to-cell transfer of virus.",

Previous studies showed that VZV, like other members of the herpesvirus family, engages cell surface heparan sulfate for initial attachment (Zhu et al., 1995). Mannose 6-phosphate inhibits infection with cell-free VZV, which implicates the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPRci) in facilitating entry of cell-free virus by interacting with viral glycoproteins that contain phosphorylated N-linked complex oligosaccharides (Gabel et al., 1989, Zhu et al., 1995). Chen et al. (2004) used stable cell lines deficient in MPRci to show that the protein is required for infection by cell-free VZV (Chen et al., 2004). However, soluble MPRci did not bind to viral glycoproteins in ligand-blotting assays (Zhu et al., 1995). Cell lines deficient in MPRci are not impaired for infection by cell-associated virus; thus, MPRci is not a cellular receptor for cell-to-cell spread of the virus.",

HSV glycoprotein D (gD) has been identified as the viral ligand for each of these receptors.

            "text": "VZV encodes at least seven glycoproteins, gB, gC, gE, gH, gI, gK, gL, all of which have well-conserved homologs in HSV (Cohen and Straus, 2001). In contrast to HSV, VZV does not have a homolog for gD. While HSV gD is one of five glycoproteins in the unique short region of its genome, the corresponding portion of VZV encodes only two VZV glycoproteins, gE and its chaperon gI. Since HSV gD is the receptor binding protein for HSV, and VZV gI is not required for infection by VZV (Cohen and Nguyen, 1997), VZV gE might be important for binding to a cellular receptor. HSV gE or HSV gD alone do not mediate membrane fusion. The minimum requirement for HSV fusion to cells is the coexpression of four glycoproteins (gD, gB, gH, and gL) and a cell-surface entry receptor specific for gD (Pertel et al., 2001). Syncytia formation in VZV, a hallmark of cell-to-cell spread, is due to fusion of cell membranes mediated by gH and gL, or gB and gE (Cole and Grose, 2003). While expression of gH or gB alone induce a modest amount of fusion, expression of gE alone is not sufficient for fusion unless it is coexpressed with gB (Maresova et al., 2001). Attempts to generate a VZV gE deletion mutant were unsuccessful (Mo et al., 2002), and a gE minus virus could only be constructed using cells expressing gE (Q.L. and J.C., unpublished data). Taken together, these findings indicate that VZV gE is an essential glycoprotein for VZV. Antibodies to gE neutralize virus in vitro, and immunization with a vector expressing gE protects animals from challenge with virus (Lowry et al., 1992, Wu and Forghani, 1997). Therefore, VZV gE may be involved in viral entry and cell-to-cell spread and is a likely candidate for binding to a cellular receptor.",

At 2.5 days after transfection, half of the cells were harvested for immunoblotting to determine the level of IDE, and the remainder of the cells was infected with cell-free ROka-lacZ. IDE-specific siRNA knocked down the IDE level by about 95% compared with control siRNAs, as calculated by densitometry (\nFigure 4A).

Interestingly, most of the X-gal positive foci in the cells transfected with IDE-specific siRNA consisted of only single isolated blue cells (Figure 4C, panels 3 and 4); in contrast, larger foci involving multiple cells, due to cell-to-cell spread of virus, were present in the cells transfected with control siRNA (Figure 4C, panels 1 and 2).

Two days later, cells transfected with human IDE showed a 3-fold increase in infectivity (\nFigure 6A).

In addition, while bacitracin blocked IDE and inhibited VZV infection and cell-to-cell spread, the antibiotic did not reduce HSV infection or cell-to-cell spread. Although HSV is closely related to VZV and has many homologous genes, our data suggest that HSV does not use IDE as a receptor. These studies allow us to begin to understand the mechanism of VZV entry and cell-to-cell spread.

Aminopeptidase N and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 are, like IDE, members of the zinc metalloprotease family (Delmas et al., 1992, Li et al., 2003). Interestingly, VZV as well as the two coronaviruses use enzymes as receptors, independent of the activity of the enzyme. Although IDE is predominately a cytosolic protein, it is also present on the plasma membrane (Goldfine et al., 1984, Kuo et al., 1993, Yaso et al., 1987). It localizes to apical or basolateral regions in different tissues (Kuo et al., 1993). A novel isoform of IDE is associated with the surface of differentiated, but not undifferentiated, neurons (Vekrellis et al., 2000). This suggests that IDE may have a role in VZV infection of neurons. IDE is also found in endosomes (Duckworth et al., 1998, Hamel et al., 1991). HSV has recently been shown to enter certain cells by endocytosis in a pH-dependent pathway (Nicola et al., 2003). If VZV is endocytosed in certain cells like HSV, then IDE might allow VZV in endosomes to penetrate into the cytosol. The tissue distribution of IDE is ubiquitous (Kuo et al., 1993), which correlates well with the broad tissue tropism of VZV, especially in vivo.",

            "text": "Compared to other human herpes viruses, VZV is unique in that it is transmitted from host to host as airborne virus, yet it disseminates within the hosts by cell-to-cell spread, similar to the pathway used for spread of virus in cell culture (Arvin, 2001). Chen et al. (2004) demonstrated that MPRci is important for cell-free, but not cell-associated, VZV infection. In contrast, IDE functions as a receptor for both cell-free and cell-associated virus. IDE and MPRci share some common features. Both molecules interact with some of the same ligands, including IGF-I, IGF-II, and epidermal growth factor (Kuo et al., 1993). At the subcellular level, IDE and MPRci both localize abundantly in endosomes, a compartment important for VZV trafficking and maturation (Hambleton et al., 2004). Therefore, IDE and MPRci might interact with each other to facilitate virus infection. Chen et al. (2004) showed that virus maturation was altered in MPRci -deficient cells, and cell-free virions were released into the medium in cell culture. In contrast, we did not detect a difference in virus maturation by electron microscopy after treatment with an IDE inhibitor (Figure S2), and inhibition of IDE did not result in release of detectable cell-free infectious virus into the cell-culture media (Q.L. and J.C., unpublished data).",

Two observations from our experiments suggest the possibility that VZV may use more than one receptor. First, blocking IDE resulted in only 25%\u201375% reduction of VZV infection and cell-to-cell spread. A similar limit on the maximum degree of inhibitory efficiency has been seen with other viruses that use more than one receptor (Akula et al., 2002, Cocchi et al., 1998, Shukla et al., 1999). Second, expression of exogenous human IDE in nonhuman cells rendered them more susceptible to VZV infectivity than to virus binding. It is likely that VZV uses another molecule, in addition to IDE, to bind to cells. Investigations are currently underway to identify other cellular molecules that are important for VZV binding and infection.",

The figure represents the results of two independent experiments. Error bars show standard deviations, and t test was used to determine p values.",

(B) Bacitracin reduces the number of X-gal positive foci in melanoma cells infected with cell-free ROka-lacZ 4 days postinfection. (C) Bacitracin inhibits cell-to-cell spread of cell-associated wild-type VZV. Melanoma cells were infected with cell-associated low passage (Molly strain) VZV in the presence or absence of bacitracin (1.0 mg/ml) for 24 hr. Cells were fixed and plaques stained with anti-gE antibody. Cell-to-cell spread was determined by measuring plaque size of virus-infected cells (Collins and Johnson, 2003). The surface area of photographed plaques in bacitracin-treated (N = 35) and -untreated (N = 51) cells was analyzed by Image J software. P values were calculated using a t test. (D) Bacitracin reduces the size of plaques for melanoma cells infected with cell-free ROka-lacZ (lower panels, two representative fields), compared to cells infected in the absence of the antibiotic (upper panels, 2 fields).

(B) Cells stably expressing human IDE show increased GFP by densitometry after transfection with a reporter plasmid that encodes GFP under a T7 promoter and incubation with cell-associated VZV encoding the T7 polymerase (ROka-T7), when compared with a control cell line that does not express human IDE. The result was repeated in three additional experiments using two different cell lines (CHO and SK6-A7), and the range of enhancement of VZV entry by IDE was 2.2- to 12.5-fold. (C) Transfection of CHO cells with HA-IDE results in increased binding of [35S]methionine labeled cell-free VZV compared with cells transfected with control plasmid. Counts per minute (CPM) were obtained by subtracting those from lysates of uninfected cells from virus-infected cells. The binding assay was performed in the presence of heparin to eliminate the contribution of attachment through cell-surface heparan sulfate. Error bars show standard deviations, and t test was used to determine p values. (D) Cotransfection of MRC-5 cells with control siRNA and plasmid expressing HA-IDE followed by infection with cell-free ROka-lacZ show increased size of infectious foci (panel 2), compared with cells transfected with control siRNA and control plasmid (panel 1). Cells transfected with IDE-specific siRNA and control plasmid and infected with ROka-lacZ show smaller-sized infectious foci (panel 3) than cells transfected with control siRNA and control plasmid (panel 1).
