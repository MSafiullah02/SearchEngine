Specifically, mucous membranes of the tracheobronchial tree become hyperemic and edematous, with increased bronchial secretion and impaired mucociliary function.6, 8 In addition, airway reactivity and resistance are heightened, not unlike in asthma, manifesting as a cough or signs of bronchial obstruction such as wheezing or dyspnea on exertion that can persist up to 8 weeks.6, 8 Unlike the case in asthma, the inflammatory changes of the tracheobronchial tree found in acute bronchitis are transient and resolve with clearance of the infection.",

Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis, and physicians would have better agreement on treatment if the consensus on diagnosis were better. Even among family physicians, the diagnostic criteria used to identify acute bronchitis vary considerably.9 Current textbooks and studies of acute bronchitis have varied in their descriptions; yet most physicians think that acute bronchitis is distinguished by the presence of cough with accompanying clinical features of a URI such as rhinorrhea and sore throat. Clinically, a better definition might be acute onset of cough without a history of chronic pulmonary disease or evidence of pneumonia or sinusitis. This definition highlights the first two steps for treatment: 1) identify patients who have chronic pulmonary disease or other coexisting medical illnesses such as congestive heart failure or immunosuppression and 2) appropriately rule out other causes of acute cough, such as pneumonia and sinusitis. After this has been done, the bulk of outpatient presentations of acute cough will be from \u201cuncomplicated acute bronchitis,\u201d which has a nonbacterial cause in more than 90% of cases.12\n",

Diagnostic studies cannot be recommended routinely because no available test can lead to definitive diagnosis of acute bronchitis. Studies are used mainly to rule out other diseases included in the differential diagnosis. For example, chest radiographs may be useful for patients with suspected pneumonia. A productive cough, either purulent or otherwise, is not predictive of bacterial infection, and microscopic examination or culture of sputum is nearly always unrevealing.8 Spirometric studies, although potentially abnormal during an episode of acute bronchitis, should be performed only when asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease is suspected and then only after resolution of the acute illness.",

During the examination, other potential causes of cough must be considered. An important cause of acute and chronic cough is postnasal drip. This is not associated with airway inflammation and can result from viral URIs, acute sinusitis, or allergic rhinitis. Patients with pneumonia can also present with cough associated with fever, wheezing, and malaise. However, these patients usually have focal changes on lung auscultation and radiographs. Clearly, patients with asthma and many of those with chronic obstructive lung disease are predisposed to the development of obstructive airway symptoms in response to common triggers such as URIs. Patients with lung neoplasms and congestive heart failure exacerbations can present with a new cough and dyspnea. Inhalation of toxic or irritating substances such as air pollution, ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, or ozone can also lead to airway irritation and cough. Other more chronic causes of cough include cystic fibrosis, gastroesophageal reflux, and medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Clearly, the differential diagnosis for acute cough includes many diseases that are not self-limited and some that may be life-threatening. These alternative diagnoses must be considered in all patients and an appropriate evaluation must be performed\u2014particularly in those older than 65 years of age with marked lung impairment or those who have a poor performance status with other coexisting medical conditions.",

However, antiviral agents are available for treating influenza, and this pathogen is frequently associated with acute bronchitis. These antiviral agents include neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, as well as amantadine and rimantadine. The major advantage of neuraminidase inhibitors is their activity against influenza B. However, although patterns change yearly, 99% of reported influenza cases in the 1999\u20132000 season were from influenza A. Although it would seem that these agents would hold great promise for the treatment of a primarily viral illness, their usefulness in the treatment of acute bronchitis is hindered severely by their weak efficacy against influenza in general. Also, these drugs are relatively expensive and, historically, physicians have been poor at accurately predicting the presence of influenza, even at the height of a seasonal epidemic.15 These agents have been shown to decrease the duration of influenza symptoms by about 1 day, but only if the treatment is initiated within the first 48 hours of the symptomatic period.15, 16 However, because of problems with cost, poor efficacy, and difficulties with accurate diagnosis of influenza, these agents cannot be recommended for routine treatment of acute bronchitis.",

Furthermore, to the individual physician, the negative effect of antibiotic overuse is difficult to appreciate. Clinicians do prescribe antibiotics in response to patient expectations.18 The assumption, however, that patients are more satisfied with an antibiotic prescription is false. Hamm et al.18 found no association between patient satisfaction and prescriptions for antibiotics among patients seeking care for respiratory infections. Instead, educating patients about the cause of their ailment and spending time with them correlated with patient satisfaction.18 Gonzales et al.19 reinforced this finding by comparing antibiotic prescription rates for acute bronchitis with a baseline period and a study period at four primary care practices. They found that antibiotic use decreased in practices that provided education and clinical contact to patients.19\n",

Even more disappointing is that physicians nationally are more likely to prescribe antibiotics for cough to patients who are white, non-Hispanic, and younger than 65 years, a population arguably least likely to benefit from such an intervention.21\n",

The cause for this rise is multifactorial; however, selective pressure of frequent antibiotic use encourages resistant strains to multiply and spread. For example, it has been demonstrated in daycare centers that previous antibiotic use is the most consistent factor for carriage of penicillin-resistant pneumococcus.22 Before the mid-1980s, virtually all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to penicillin.4 Today, in some areas of the country, more than 30% of S. pneumoniae isolates demonstrate an intermediate to high level of resistance to penicillin. Usually, these strains are also resistant to other antibiotics such as macrolides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and cephalosporins.",

Despite a predominantly viral cause and numerous randomzied controlled studies documenting no meaningful benefit from antibiotics, more than 70% of patients presenting with acute bronchitis are given antibiotic prescriptions. Consequently, penicillin resistance of S. pneumoniae and other bacteria has increased, prompting requests to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. Diagnosis and management of this problem are flawed, even among providers most involved in ambulatory medicine. Obstetricians and gynecologists are increasingly involved in providing primary care and should be knowledgeable about the evidence regarding the cause and management of acute bronchitis.",
