However, at present there is no agreed-on set of public health competencies that family physicians and other primary care practitioners should attain to better ensure they possess the necessary knowledge, skills, and confidence to effectively face diverse public health situations\u2014from common to emergent. Using an iterative consultative process, the authors developed a set of public health competencies relevant to family medicine and primary care.",

This symposium arose out of discussions at the pan-Canadian Public Health Human Resources Task Force concerning the role of primary care practitioners in Canada's public health workforce. The primary goals of the symposium were to identify: (1) the public health competencies that family medicine residents should possess at graduation; and (2) the primary care competencies that community medicine residents should possess at graduation. To help address these goals, a presymposium discussion document was prepared by reviewing existing documents to develop an initial competency draft using a \u201cmulti-level competency model\u201d developed by the University of Toronto's Department of Family and Community Medicine. The resources accessed and reviewed to inform the preparation of the presymposium discussion document included: \u2022the College of Family Physicians of Canada's The Role of the Family Doctor in Public Health and Emergency Preparedness\n1;\u2022the Medical Council of Canada's undergraduate medical education objectives, particularly the seven addressing \u201cPopulation Health\u201d3;\u2022the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada's Objectives of Training for the medical specialty of community medicine4;\u2022the Core Competencies for Public Health in Canada that were developed in partnership with the Public Health Agency of Canada5;\u2022The medical discipline\u2013specific Minimum Competencies for Medical Officers of Health (i.e., public health officers) that were developed under the sponsorship of the Public Health Agency of Canada6;\u2022the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) statement regarding the community medicine objectives required in family medicine residency programs7;\u2022the ACGME statement regarding the requirements for residency programs in public health and general preventive medicine.8\n\n",

This group included 12 residency directors (six family medicine, six community medicine) and 12 residents (six family medicine, six community medicine) from across Canada. The presymposium discussion document, which included a proposed set of draft competencies, was distributed to the participants for their review prior to the symposium. The draft competencies served as the major item for discussion by the participants during the symposium's plenary and small group discussions. Symposium discussions enabled the authors to further revise the discussion document and proposed set of competencies. This revised draft was then sent to all symposium participants for additional review and feedback, which resulted in the proposal of a detailed set of public health competencies relevant to family medicine and primary care (Appendix B, available online at www.ajpmonline.org).",

A key finding arising from this review was that only focused, essential competencies could be realistically identified within each of these 14 domains. This resulted in five public health competencies being identified and approved for inclusion in the competency-based residency curriculum, each accompanied by one or more enabling subcompetencies. These five overarching public health competencies are: \u2022demonstrate an effective approach to disease prevention and health promotion;\u2022demonstrate an effective approach to infectious disease prevention and control, including outbreaks;\u2022demonstrate an effective approach to environmental health issues;\u2022develop and apply the knowledge and skills necessary to assess a population's health;\u2022demonstrate an effective approach to public communication, collaboration, and advocacy.\n",
