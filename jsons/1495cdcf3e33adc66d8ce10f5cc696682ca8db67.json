The federal government has generally provided information in both official languages during the outbreak, for example by using simultaneous interpretation. However, as the situation became more urgent, a gradual easing of language restrictions has occurred. After stocks of sanitizing products were depleted, Health Canada lifted bilingual labeling regulations to allow materials featuring English-only instructions to be distributed (Fortin-Gauthier, 2020) . Five weeks later, this directive was extended to apply to all cleaning products. English has been the primary language of the Prime Minister's daily briefings, unequally supplemented by French (Vachet, 2020) . He also addressed children of the nation in English only, once on March 22 (Tang, 2020) and then on April 5 (CBC, 2020). Official Languages Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly, who is on the emergency response task force, has been mum about these deviations to the norm. Commissioner of Official Languages Raymond Th\u00e9berge has recently spoken out, reminding the federal government that upholding its language obligations during the outbreak was \"a matter of respect and safety for all Canadians,\" and announcing that he would publish a special report on the federal government's respect of the OLA in its response to the COVID-19 crisis (OCOL, 2020).",

The French Language Services Act does not require the provincial government to provide all of its communications in both French and English. However, in 2010, the Treasury Board adopted the Communications in French Directive, following lessons learned from the H1N1 outbreak after French-language documentation had not been distributed. This directive mandates all provincial ministries and agencies to \"consider the Francophone community's specific needs\" and to \"incorporate appropriate approaches into the communications activities, to reach Francophone audiences effectively\" (Government of Ontario, 2010) . In this respect, the province has not fulfilled its duties. Until the third week of April, daily briefings were held in English only (Gratton, 2020) . Written documentation was made available in French hours after publication in English, and there have been delays in posting information in French regarding COVID-19 on the Ontario.ca website. Associate Ombudsman of Ontario Kelly Burke has received complaints about these discrepancies (Carolino, 2020) .",

            "text": "Of all the language regimes in Canada, New Brunswick's is the most generous to its official-language minority. Canada's only officially bilingual province, New Brunswick adopted legislation in 1981 recognizing the equality of the French-and English-language communities-an act which was entrenched in the constitution in 1993. Perhaps because of these enhanced obligations, linguistic shortcomings in the government response to COVID-19 have been felt more acutely. Despite the availability of simultaneous interpretation during briefings, Premier Blaine Higgs has not made use of the service, and has occasionally refused to answer questions fielded by Francophone reporters (Gravel, 2020) . Commissioner of Official Languages Shirley MacLean noted that \"the [New Brunswick] Official Languages Act applies to institutions, not to elected representatives\" (Gravel, 2020; personal translation) . However, New Brunswick's linguistic obligations may be unfulfilled by simultaneous interpretation, rather requiring a French-language interlocutor to provide equal services to both linguistic communities, in the spirit of section 16.1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Radio-Canada, 2020). Qu\u00e9bec Qu\u00e9bec shines by comparison in the domain of COVID-19 minority-language communications. Despite la Charte de la langue fran\u00e7aise providing no obligation to do so, daily briefings by Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault have consistently been held in French and English, without the use of interpreters. However, there have been some gaps in written information distributed to citizens. A \"COVID guide\" sent to all Qu\u00e9bec households was originally available in French only (Chambers, 2020) . It was translated into English and distributed in paper form several weeks later (Montreal Gazette, 2020). The Secr\u00e9tariat du Qu\u00e9bec aux relations canadiennes (SQRC) has published a special edition of its French-language \"COVID guide\" for Francophones outside of Qu\u00e9bec (SQRC, 2020) , filling the gap left by other provinces with respect to minority-language services and demonstrating a form of \"kin-state\" action on behalf of Qu\u00e9bec.",

As previously stated, some governments have relied on simultaneous interpretation or closed captioning of briefings relayed on electronic platforms. Yet these are not accessible to all citizens, notably in rural or remote areas. Some argue that since the rate of bilingualism is higher among Francophones in Canada (Statistics Canada, 2017), everyone should understand the guidelines circulated in English. However, French unilingualism is common, especially among the elderly, and English-French bilingualism is often self-evaluated. Francophones tend to overstate their capacity in English in surveys or during interactions with state institutions (Deveau et al., 2009; Tardif and Dallaire, 2010) . Therefore, in order to ensure proper understanding of daily directives, access to information in French is paramount. There is anecdotal evidence that French speakers outside of Quebec watch the Quebec briefings to access information in French (Liberal Party of Ontario, 2020) . This may prompt citizens to comply with Quebec's guidelines, rather than those of their own province, which could have public safety (and legal) implications.",

They can also lead to health promotion and education resources being underused. These risks are higher for vulnerable members of society, among whom are the elderly (OFLSC, 2016). As we know, COVID-19 disproportionately affects seniors, who make up a comparatively larger proportion of the Francophone population in minority communities compared to the majority and who have a low level of literacy, making it harder for them to navigate the health system (Bouchard and Desmeules, 2017) . Also, second-language proficiency decreases with age, and stressful conditions and cognitive issues such as dementia are aggravating factors (OFLSC, 2018) . It is thus imperative that this segment of the population receive information on COVID-19 in its mother tongue. Some of these observations are also valid for recent Francophone immigrants outside of Qu\u00e9bec.",
