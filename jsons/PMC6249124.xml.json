            "text": "Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) was serendipitously identified in 1996 (Fraser et al., 1996) during active surveillance of pteropodid bats (flying foxes) for Hendra virus, a novel zoonotic paramyxovirus which dramatically emerged in 1994 in Australia (Murray et al., 1995). Lyssaviruses belong to the family Rhabdoviridae, and prior to the description of ABLV, there were six recognised species/genotypes: classical rabies virus (genotype 1), Lagos bat virus (genotype 2), Mokola virus (genotype 3), Duvenhage virus (genotype 4), European bat lyssavirus 1 (genotype 5) and European bat lyssavirus 2 (genotype 6). The description of ABLV precipitated a revision of lyssavirus taxonomy, with genotype 7 defined to accommodate it (Badrane, Bahloul, Perrin, & Tordo, 2001; Gould et al., 1998). Sequence analysis of the ABLV nucleocapsid protein gene (used as the basis for genotypic classification) showed marked nucleotide and amino acid homology (73%\u201374% and 92%, respectively) with classical rabies viruses (CRV), and the ABLV phosphoprotein, matrix protein and glycoprotein genes also show a closer sequence homology to CRV than to the other lyssaviruses (Gould et al., 1998). Further, ABLV and CRV share the same serotype (1), with cross\u2010neutralisation evident against 19 of a panel of 21 monoclonal antibodies (Gould et al., 1998). Rabies vaccine and anti\u2010rabies immunoglobulin protect laboratory animals from ABLV infection (Hooper et al., 1997) and are evidently equally effective in humans, although Brookes, Parsons, Johnson, McElhinney, and Fooks (2005) suggest that maximum vaccine efficacy against ABLV (and other non\u2010RABV lyssaviruses) may require a higher virus\u2010neutralising antibody threshold. Two variants of ABLV have been described, with isolates from pteropodid bats (Pteropus spp.) and yellow\u2010bellied sheathtail bats (Saccolaimus flaviventris) falling into two distinct clades by sequence analysis (Gould, Kattenbelt, Gumley, & Lunt, 2002; Gould, Kattenbelt, Hyatt, Gumley, & Lunt, 1999; Warrilow, Smith, Harrower, & Smith, 2002).",

Rhabdoviruses from the genus Ephemerovirus were known to occur (e.g.,Bovine ephemeral fever, Adelaide River virus), but none from the genus Lyssavirus had been described. Prophetically, St George (1989), postulating the origins of Adelaide River virus, suggested the possibility of an undiscovered rabieslike virus in Australian bats. St. George went further, suggesting that the typically low prevalence of lyssavirus infections in bats meant that an Australian bat lyssavirus might not become evident unless active surveillance was undertaken or unless a human or a domestic animal was infected by a bat.",

A second fatal human case occurred in December 1998, 27 months after a bite from a flying fox (Hanna et al., 2000). These cases precipitated an aggressive public heath campaign promoting avoidance of bat contact and rabies vaccination for vocationally at\u2010risk people. No further human cases were reported until 2012 when a young boy contracted a fatal infection following unsolicited contact with a bat (Francis et al., 2014). This tragic case reignited public and media interest in ABLV, which was further promoted by two related equine cases in 2013 (Shinwari et al., 2014).",

Bats from which only blood was taken were typically sampled under inhalation anaesthetic (Jonsson, Johnston, Field, Jong, & Smith, 2004) with individuals released at the point of capture within four hours. Bats from which brain (or brain and blood) samples were taken were humanely euthanised immediately prior to sampling: larger bats (Pteropodidae and Megadermatidae) by a lethal dose of barbiturate (Lethabarb\u00ae, 325 mg/ml pentobarbitone sodium, Virbac) intravenously or (diluted 1:3) intraperitoneally and smaller bats (Hipposideridae and Vespertilioniformes) by the inhalation of CO2.

Subsequently, an equal volume of challenge virus is added to serum dilutions, and after 24 hr of incubation, the number of fluorescing fields counted. The criterion for positivity was a 50% reduction in infectious centres relative to a positive (NIH reference serum) control.

            "text": "Despite its first description in 1996, there has been limited investigation of the eco\u2010epidemiology of ABLV in Australian bats (Barrett, 2004; Field, 2005). This report shows that ABLV is taxonomically widespread in Australian bats, with evidence of infection found in five of the six families present. The detection of either antigen or antibody in bats in three of the four states/territories surveyed further supports the historic presence of the virus in Australia, as the taxonomic and geographical scale of detections is epidemiologically inconsistent with recent introduction. The lack of detections in NSW likely reflects the limited number of samples from that state. However, the findings indicate that at the population level, infection prevalence is low, with viral antigen not detected in the wild\u2010caught cohort notwithstanding reasonably large sample sizes in some taxa known (from submitted samples) to be susceptible to infection. In Pteropus spp. for example, with a sample size of 475, this translates to an estimated \u201cbackground\u201d infection prevalence in wild populations of <0.5%. That ABLV causes clinical disease, debilitation and death in bats means that infected bats are over\u2010represented in the submitted bat cohort, with such individuals more likely to be found and submitted than healthy bats. With many such submissions being debilitated bats found in urban backyards, the higher infection prevalence in this cohort (e.g., 7.6% in Pteropus spp.) has direct public health significance because of the higher risk of human exposure.",

            "text": "Antigen detection was significantly higher in the genus Saccolaimus (S. flaviventris) than in all other genera, while P. scapulatus had a significantly higher antigen prevalence than other Pteropus species. From a public health perspective, these findings suggest that these two species pose a heightened exposure risk. The lack of antigen detection in Vespertilioniformes other than S. flaviventris may in part reflect their typically smaller size, which makes them less readily detected by members of the public, meaning that relatively few are submitted. The lack of a positively biased sample is a fundamental impediment to the direct detection of infection in these species and to a more complete elaboration of the ecology and phylogeny of ABLV in Australian bats. That said, it appears evident from the findings that Pteropus spp. and S. flaviventris play an important role in the ecology of ABLV. This is supported by phylogenetic analyses to date, which identify two distinct virus clades reflecting sequence variation in Pteropus spp. and S. flaviventris isolates (Warrilow et al., 2002). Given bat diversity in Australia, it is probable that targeted surveillance will reveal further diversity. Such surveillance might usefully focus on the Mollosidae and Vespertilionidae, both of which had multiple genera in which antibodies were detected.",

            "text": "Generically, antibodies provide indirect evidence of past exposure or infection. However, serology has been an irrelevant lyssavirus surveillance tool in nonbat species because of a near 100% case fatality rate. The putative adapted ancestral reservoir of lyssaviruses (Badrane & Tordo, 2001), bats are the only taxa in which antibodies are detected with sufficient frequency to support serosurveillance. The crude antibody prevalence in wild\u2010caught bats in this study was 18%. Some taxa yielded high antibody prevalence in very small sample sizes; conversely, no antibodies were detected in Miniopterus notwithstanding a reasonably large sample size across multiple locations and times. Arguin et al. (2002) reported an anti\u2010ABLV antibody prevalence of 9.5% (22/231) in a multigenera sample of Philippine bats (including Miniopterus) using a RFFIT with a specific ABLV antigen. The detection of only five antibody\u2010positive individuals in a parallel RFITT using rabies virus antigen suggests that the latter has a sensitivity of only 23% relative to the ABLV RFFIT, at least on the virus circulating in the Philippine bats. Thus, notwithstanding the different criteria for positivity in Arguin et al. (2002) (90% or greater reduction in infectious centres versus 50% in the AAHL assay), it is probable that serologic investigations in Australian bats using rabies virus RFITT underestimate ABLV antibody prevalence.",

As discussed above, screening a positively biased sample is one approach to the challenge, but while useful to establish presence, it can constrain understanding of the characteristics of the infection at the population level. An alternative is to increase sample size, but where the test requires destructive sampling (as for lyssavirus FAT), this alternative is untenable from both an ethical and a resource standpoint; statistically, to detect an infected individual at say 0.1% infection prevalence would necessitate the capture and destruction of 1,000 individuals. In bats, serology offers a larger surveillance \u201cwindow\u201d because of the typically persistent nature of antibodies. Whether anti\u2010lyssavirus antibodies represent noninfectious exposure, subclinical \u201caborted\u201d infection, pending clinical infection or recovered infection is unclear and contentious, but in the context of this study, it is also irrelevant. Detection of antibodies in this study is interpreted as evidence of ABLV \u201cinfection\u201d at a population level rather than the status of an individual bat. Nonetheless, serosurveillance has limitations in that the absence of detection of antibodies cannot be interpreted as the absence of susceptibility to infection of taxa, and prevalence comparisons across taxa are not valid in the absence of relative case fatality rates. Finally, serology does not allow identification of the current infection status of an individual nor provide antigenic material to support molecular epidemiology studies.",

While the infection prevalence in wild populations is evidently low, the findings suggest that some species have a higher likelihood of infection, although this interpretation should be constrained by the nonrandom nature of the sampling and the varying sample sizes. Nonetheless, it is evident that the submitted bat cohort (comprising bats rescued by members of the public) poses a substantially higher ABLV exposure risk from a human health perspective. The enduring messaging from both animal and human health authorities in Australia is for members of the public to avoid direct contact with all bats, to call registered and vaccinated wildlife carers to rescue a bat and to seek immediate medical advice should direct contact occur.",
