Briefly, 96-well polyvinyl plates were coated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (DAKO), blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with serum from the treated dogs, diluted 1:500. Bound ATG was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L; Pierce, Rockford, IL) as the secondary antibody. The color reagent was 2,2\u2032-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and plates were read with a Vmax microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) at 405 nm. Standard curves were established with known concentrations of ATG, and sera from dogs before infusion served as controls. A similar procedure was used to detect anti-rabbit antibodies, except that plates were coated with diluted ATG, and bound antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-dog IgM (\u03bc chain) or IgG (H+L; ICN, Aurora, OH) to distinguish between the 2 isotypes. Titers of anti-dog IgG within the ATG preparation were determined as follows: plates were coated with normal dog IgG (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA), and ATG was added in serial 1:2 dilutions; bound antibodies were revealed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and normal rabbit IgG was used as a negative control.",

However, engraftment in dogs after only 1 Gy of TBI was uniformly transient; this suggests a delicate immunologic balance. Results from previously published TBI dose de-escalation studies [26, 27] have allowed us to estimate the residual host T-cell populations in dogs given 2 and 1 Gy of TBI to be 10% and 35%, respectively (Schwartz and Storb, unpublished data, 2005).",

Assuming, next, a reduction of host T cells by rabbit ATG of 50%, the combination of pretransplantation ATG and 1 Gy of TBI should result in an estimated residual host T-cell population of approximately 17%. Thus, ATG plus 1 Gy of TBI fell short of the 10% residual host T cells estimated for 2 Gy of TBI, which permitted sustained engraftment in 11 of 12 dogs studied. It was not clear why 1 of the 5 dogs showed sustained engraftment, although a possible explanation might be fortuitous matching for a more important minor histocompatibility locus. At present, we are unable to determine minor histocompatibility antigens by in vitro tests.",

In this analysis, larger total nucleated cell numbers showed a trend toward a longer duration of engraftment, and this suggests that marrow cells might facilitate their own engraftment in a dose-dependent manner and through a similar mechanism.

The latter observation is corroborated by 2 other studies [22, 31] in which the hosts produced anti-ATG antibodies of the IgG isotype. Dogs in the present study were exposed to ATG for the first time; however, they mounted secondary immune responses. To reconcile these 2 facts, we propose the following explanation: as shown, ATG contained rabbit antibodies that cross-reacted with canine IgG. IgG is also found in membrane-bound form in the B-cell antigen receptor (mIgG-BCR). It is possible that ATG cross-reacted with the mIgG-BCR and triggered B cells through this very effective signaling pathway, leading to their activation and proliferation and to efficient production of IgG antibodies [33], which, in turn, might have ATG complementarities and might lead to neutralization and clearance of ATG.",
