            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious swine disease. The main clinical signs include severe vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration in suckling piglets [1,2,3]. The disease was first identified in the United Kingdom in 1971, and outbreaks have been reported in many pig-producing countries in Europe and Asia [4,5,6,7]. PED outbreaks have recently appeared in the United States [8] and rapidly spread in North America, including Mexico and Canada [9], causing significant economic losses to the swine industry [10,11]. PED is caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the sub-family Coronavirinae [12]. The PEDV has a 28-kb, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome that encodes four structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) [13]. The spike (S) protein is an important envelope glycoprotein of the virus and plays a vital role in interacting with cellular receptors for virus entry, mediating cell fusion, and induction of neutralizing antibodies. Thus, the S protein is considered a suitable candidate for examining the epidemiological status of the virus in the field, strain diversity, the association between gene mutations and viral antigenicity, and developing diagnostic assays and vaccines [14,15,16,17]. Although the most of sow herds had immunized with a CV777-based vaccine, large-scale outbreaks of PED were still reported in China since late 2010. It resulted in high rates of morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets and substantial economic losses in the country. Both modified live vaccines and killed vaccines were commercially available in China, but the current vaccines were less effective against the PEDV variants, and the PED epidemics were not properly controlled. This may be attributed to antigenic and genetic differences between the vaccine strains and the epidemic strains [18,19,20]. Thus, the need for the development of better vaccines against the novel PEDV is urgent in the future.",

Type I interferon (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) is a group of structurally similar, functionally similar, low-molecular glycoproteins, which are the first lines of host defense against virus infection [24]. PEDV could inhibit type I interferon (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and pro-inflammatory cytokines at the transcriptional level by blocking I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation [25,26]. However, the ability of PEDV variant strains and successive passage strains to induce the production of type I interferon (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in host cells has not been reported.",

Analysis of the S gene indicated that the isolated virus SDSX16 belongs to the G2 genotype. Following over 100 successive passages on Vero cells, the adapted SDSX16 virus replicated to high titers compared with wildtype virus. We further uncovered that there were continuous 18 nucleotides (nt) deletion in the spike gene, which caused a six amino acid deletion in the SDSX16-P64 and significantly higher titer than that SDSX16-P63. Compared with SDSX16-P10, the pathogenicity of SDSX16-P75 was weakened, and porcine intestinal epithelial cells, infected with SDSX16-P75, produced higher levels of cytokines, not only at the mRNA levels, but also at the protein levels. Our research found that the deletion of 6 amino acids in the S gene may be associated with increased viral replication in cells rather than attenuation in pigs. These data will lay the foundation for future research on targeted PEDV effective vaccines.",

We then investigated whether the isolate could be efficiently cultivated and maintained in cultured cells. To do this, the isolated PEDV strain SDSX16 was serially passaged in Vero cells for a total of 100 passages (P1 to P100). The time for the onset of CPE was typically 24 h and prominent CPE was observed within 48 h post-inoculation. The development of CPE was faster in later passages. The visible CPE appeared at 18 h and became predominant by 36 h. Virus propagation was confirmed by detecting PEDV antigens by IFA using an anti-PEDV spike-specific monoclonal antibody. The distinct staining pattern for typical syncytia formation was distributed in the cytoplasm. In contrast, neither CPE nor spike-specific monoclonal antibody staining was detected in mock-inoculated cells.

[14,18,19,33] isolates exhibited an insertion of five amino acids at 59\u201362 position, 140 position, as well as the deletion of two amino acid at 163\u2013164 position (Figure 4B). The same insertions and deletions have been found in other variant strains isolated, indicating that epidemics are caused by variant strains in many countries. Moreover, in comparison with the CV777 strain, some amino acid substitutions in the neutralizing region of the core of epitope (COE) (499\u2013638aa) were observed [34,35] and the regions of the aligned sequences, corresponding to these regions were COE (514\u2013642aa, Figure 4C). The sequence analysis revealed that the other variant strains had the same COE mutations. The S gene of SDSX16 at different passage levels (SDSX16 P10-P100 GenBank number: MN241452-MN241464) were analyzed. The results showed that the spike gene had an 18 nt deletion resulting in the deletion of 6 amino acids when the SDSX16 was passaged to the P64, and this deletion was stable until the P100 (Figure 4D).",

Interestingly, the amino acid sequence analysis results of SDSX16-P63, -P64, -P75 showed no mutations in ORF1a/b, M, N, E, and ORF3 genes. Also, the S gene of SDSX16-P64 mainly lost six amino acids than the -P63 S gene and the S gene of -P75 had no amino acid deletion or addition compared to the S gene of -P64. These results suggest that the biggest difference in the genomes of SDSX16-P64 and -P63 is the 6 amino acid deletion in -P64.",

We collected clinical samples from pig breeding farms in Shandong Province where severe acute diarrhea was associated with high mortality in suckling piglets. Isolation of variant strains is important for effective control of piglet PEDV infection and vaccine development. In this study, we successfully isolated a strain of PEDV from the intestinal tissues of a PED-infected piglet. The PEDV SDSX16 isolate showed obvious CPE (syncytium formation) in Vero cells from after passage 5, the viral titers started from roughly 104.15 TCID50/mL and increased after serial passages to 107.6 TCID50/mL. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene sequences showed the SDSX16 isolate belonged to subgroup II. More recently, it has been reported that PEDV G2 strain-based inactivated vaccine candidates are candidates for developing an effective vaccine against the virulent pandemic PEDV strains [39]. These results suggest the SDSX16 strain could be a candidate strain for vaccine development against PEDV variant strains.",

The result found the S gene had greater diversity, while other genes (ORF1a/b, M, N, E, and ORF3) occurred acid point mutants. We further determined the serial passage of SDX16 in Vero cells resulted in the viral growth adaptation and promoting its replication in vitro by growth kinetics and virus titration assay. The serial passage of PEDV and other coronaviruses often results in the attenuation of virus virulence [40,41,42,43,44]. To study whether the serial passages of SDSX16 have influenced the viral pathogenicity, PEDV-seronegative, three-day-old pigs were inoculated orally with SDSX16 different viruses. The results suggested that successive passage resulted in attenuation of the SDSX16 strain, and deleting six amino acids in the S gene might affect the pathogenicity of the virus. Although data indicating pivotal roles of S protein in determining phenotypes of coronaviruses have been accumulated, it remains to be determined whether the mutations in the S gene of SDSX16 contribute to the viral attenuation and virus virulence. Therefore, we will need to apply PEDV reverse genetics systems to further studies to define the genetic mechanisms that underlie the attenuation of PEDV.",

TNF-\u03b1 has an antiviral function, and IL6 is associated with improving humoral and mucosal immune response [21,46]. Variant PEDV (genogroup G2) exhibits higher resistance to the interferon than the existing PEDV and avoids the neutralizing antibody against PEDV [47,48,49]. In order to understand whether there were differences in the cytokine levels between the SDSX16-P10 and -P75 strain. We compared SDSX16-P10 with -P75 and found that IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels could be up-regulated in porcine intestinal epithelial cells. However, the mRNA and protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in cells induced by SDSX16-P75, were much higher than SDSX16-P10. Additionally, it has been reported that highly pathogenic PEDV strain suppressed the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon production through the down-regulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) [25,26,50,51,52]. SDSX16-P75 induces higher levels of cytokine production indicating that the pathogenicity of the SDSX16 strain is weakened by the successive passage in vitro, which is consistent with the results of animal experiments. Our study demonstrated that the ability of PEDV to induce type I IFNs is strain-specific. Thus, Type I IFNs may play an important role in PEDV replication and pathogenesis.",
