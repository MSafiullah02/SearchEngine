While direct causality among factors is nearly impossible to \u201cprove\u201d in complex circumstances such as this, systems researchers rely on such triangulation and multiple evidence-based methodologies to track trends and make sense of emergent linked phenomena (Klenk and Meehan 2015; Poteete et al. 2010; Roe 1998; Moran-Ellis et al. 2006). The literature on hazards and disasters distinguishes between the former as being a precondition (in the form of a hazardous agent or circumstance) to a disaster. A hazard is therefore a disaster waiting to happen. Hazardous conditions set the stage for a disaster to occur. In the case of Ebola, the hazardous agent is the virus itself. The virus itself does not in itself \u201ccause\u201d the outbreak, just as a hazard in itself does not \u201ccause\u201d the disaster. Rather, the social, political, cultural, economic and biophysical conditions and factors we write about in this chapter all contributed to enabling the disease to spread. Here the enablement of disease spread also, notably, extends to the outbreak response, including how these numerous factors hindered the outbreak response.",

The situation is different now. The virus found its way along the human food chain towards the exploding centres of a rapidly urbanizing Africa. It reached large cities with their huge inequities, overcrowding, and underdeveloped sanitation and public health systems, and only extreme measures fuelled by moral panic have thus far (and perhaps temporarily) prevented its global spread in the same way SARS expanded across the globe in 2003.

It was also pointed out that a large pool of exposed but disease-resistant people, such as those now living in Ebola-ravaged areas of West Africa, would facilitate the development of a serum-based vaccine. Even if a vaccine is developed and tested, will it ever be widely available and accessible to all those who need it, in Africa and globally? Will this become yet another source of profits for Big Pharma? As has often been noted, there are \u201ctensions inherent in the socioeconomic construct that is today\u2019s pharmaceutical industry [which on one hand seeks to protect] the health of the public, but on the other it seeks to maximize profit\u201d (Cohen et al. 2006: 2). There may, then, be an understandable concern that seeking a cure or antidote for Ebola might become either an opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry to use Africa as a laboratory (see Chippaux 2004), or as another source of profits for the pharmaceutical industry, rather than promoting the enhancement of well-being. Or, as David Healy has said more dramatically, \u201can incentive to chase blockbuster profits\u2014doing so regardless of patient welfare\u201d (Healy 2012: 55).",

A planetary process of urbanization is underway across vast networks of infrastructure lines, resource supply chains and human travel (Brenner 2014). As much of this urbanization leads to massive peripheral settlement in existing and new urban centres, often in contiguity with previously mostly undisturbed natural landscapes, we can speak of \u201csuburban constellations\u201d at the heart of the process (Keil 2013; Bloch 2015; Mabin 2013; Leahy 2011). A new landscape of risk emerges (Bloch et al. 2013). In mining towns, sometimes physically remote and isolated but connected through global metabolisms and labour markets, we can speak of a \u201cferal\u201d form of suburbanization that confronts human and non-human nature in direct encounter (Shields 2012). By 2030, it is expected that urbanized land on the planet will cover 1.2 million square kilometres which is twice as much as in 2000. This massive urbanization is unequally distributed across the globe, with China and Africa absorbing the lion\u2019s share of global urbanization during the next generation. We can expect significant consequences for climate change, biodiversity, etc. (Seto et al. 2012; Oxfam 2008). In this context, Ebola, once thought of as being an isolated problem in remote rural areas, has become an urban disease affecting cities and their peripheries, where its spread tends to be rapid and seemingly random due to massive human interaction and often dense and unhygienic living conditions.",

The Ebola crisis points further in this direction: public health institutions and procedures in cities are absolutely critical (and they often failed in the cases of SARS as well as Ebola).

The health burden of climate change also includes the emergence and increased incidence of infectious and water borne diseases. The current Ebola outbreak was a chance encounter between a 2-year old child and a fruit bat, the reservoir for the virus (Baize et al. 2014; Sa\u00e9z et al. 2015; WHO 2015). Some studies cite climate variability as the cause for fruit bats to migrate long distances and reside near cities and towns (Frumkin et al. 2008; Pinzon et al. 2004). An Action Aid (2006) study on the increasing flood frequency in six African cities reports that \u201cclimate change is altering rainfall patterns and tending to increase storm frequency and intensity\u201d. In Sierra Leone, recent extreme weather observed includes heavy rains that cause flash floods, mass land movement, injuries and fatalities, and infrastructure damage (Figs. 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3). Heavy rains precipitated the 2012 cholera epidemic that started in Guinea (7350 cases and 133 fatalities) and eventually spread to Sierra Leone (23,124 cases and 299 fatalities) (WHO 2012).\n\n\n",

An oft-neglected consideration of the disease ecology is the role that stigmatization may play in disease transmission dynamics. Stigma is a common aspect of all cultural systems and quite often used in the service of social control (Goffman 1963). As such, despite the reality of the lethality of Ebola, the challenges that stigmatization poses for the effectiveness of outbreak response should not be trivialized. Patients may conceal the fact that they are infected, for various reasons related to stigmatization. For instance, one Liberian physician observed that \u201cSome patients don\u2019t tell the truth. They come to you with a different story, like \u2018abdominal pain\u2019. It\u2019s because of the stigma of Ebola. They think they won\u2019t be treated and they\u2019ll be sent away\u201d (York 2014c). Stigmatization in the Ebola outbreak situation is not limited to patients. Health care workers, for example, were evicted from their homes by landlords out of fear (York 2014b). Furthermore, mobs in rural villages attacked journalists and health care workers (including those engaged in educational efforts but especially those responsible for removing the deceased). Similar to the situation with HIV/AIDS (Lewis 2006), orphans whose parents had succumbed to Ebola also became stigmatized during the earlier stages of the outbreaks. Given that UNICEF found that as of 6 February 2015, there existed 16,000 orphans in the Ebola-affected West African countries (UN NewsCentre 2015), the potential for a tragic problem has loomed. However, a UNICEF official remarked on a positive note that:There were fears that stigma around Ebola would isolate the orphaned children, which would mean there would be thousands of abandoned children, but that has, luckily, not materialized.

This is an especially important issue in light of the observation by the WHO Director-General that the Ebola outbreak response urgently required outside assistance (Weintraub 2014). Western hospitals were reluctant to allow medical staff to go to West Africa, or take in Ebola-infected patients, due to worries of being labelled as the \u201cEbola hospital\u201d in their community, or because of concerns that taking such actions would cause anxiety amongst in-house hospital staff (York 2014a). At another level, stigmatization may be understood as coming from the conflation of race with disease. This association may be bolstered by the term \u201cEbola\u201d itself. According to one linguist, \u201cEbola\u201d connotes to American listeners the very idea of Africa because of its sound similarities to \u2018ebonics\u2019 or \u2018ebony\u2019 in the American vernacular (Troutman 2014).",

The effects of such neocolonial influences are seen, for example, in the way in which medical research in the Global North has benefited from blood, parasites, and viruses collected from the people of the Global South. The patented vaccines developed from such materials benefit those in the Global North (and especially the private pharmaceutical companies). As noted by Fearnley (2015), such biomedical gains did little to help build public health capacity and infrastructure within West Africa. Dealing with such enduring forms of stigmatization is vexing because of the structural dimensions involved in the geopolitics of dependency and Global North-South relations. One way forward, however, may be seen in the recent efforts of the African Union to establish an Ebola Solidarity Fund and an African centre for disease control by mid-2015 (Anders 2015). This initiative may have the potential to serve as an impetus to organize and institutionalize efforts against the types of stigmatization that ensue from structural dependency and power differentials embedded in neocolonialism.",

As such it has been noted that there is a \u201ctendency (in) the international media to attract viewers (which) has led some careless journalists to focus almost exclusively on the fear-invoking mode of death from the disease\u201d such as the garish images of victims \u201ccoughing up blood\u201d (Wallace 2014). Such foci are often fed by stereotypes about Africa, which are also linked to the oft-depicted image of Africa as a site of primitivism and catastrophe, the sources of which lie in colonial discourses of backwardness, exoticism and savagery. Thus, while it may be that having a fear of Ebola is a somewhat understandable response and not in itself a colonial attitude, the colonial legacy nevertheless exerts a tacit and often unrecognized influence on the fear. Specifically, it may \u201cfan the flames of fear\u201d or to put it in more technical terms, the colonial legacy may contribute to the phenomenon known as the \u201csocial amplification of risk\u201d, whereby peoples\u2019 perceptions of risk are unreasonably intensified (Kasperson et al. 1988).",

The need to engage communities in successful health initiatives is well-established (Israel et al. 1998) and yet this seems to have been lost in the urgency of the international response. International initiatives responding to the Ebola epidemic focused on immediate treatment responses, the development and delivery of vaccines, security and containment, and large initiatives like building hospitals. For example, Canada\u2019s contribution to the Ebola campaign was the provision of protective gear, setting up mobile labs, and the delivery of an experimental vaccine (Public Health Agency of Canada 2014). At best, these responses have been slow, expensive, difficult to coordinate, and unsustainable (Gundan 2014). At their worst, the responses met resistance by local populations, and were slow to adapt to the local contexts, thus rendering such responses ineffective and inefficient, and in the end, leaving the communities vulnerable to the next health crises.",

            "text": "The importance of acknowledging and respecting concerns and practices of local communities and their socio-political context has been identified as a major issue in implementing health policies and practices (Nichter 2008). In reviewing the trajectory of the response to the Ebola outbreak, Petherick (2015) noted the general lack of trust between medical teams and local communities. This lack of trust contributed to community responses ranging from hiding Ebola cases from health workers, to attacking health workers and health facilities, driven by the belief that medical staff were spreading the infection, rather than trying to contain it. Mitman (2014) argues that the colonial history between Africa and Europe is one underlying source of this mistrust, a history that began with slave traders and missionaries and continues with the current European exploitation of resources and labour and Western military involvement in a range of conflicts. In the early to mid 1900s, American medical researchers followed this path of exploitation, extracting blood, tissue and, ultimately, knowledge, on expeditions to Africa, with some amount of coercion and without benefit or explanation to local populations (Karamouzian and Hategekimana 2015). This history of violence, invasion and exploitation has not been forgotten and could only have been reinforced by the presence of Western military personnel supporting biohazard-suited health workers (Bayntun et al. 2014).",

Moreover, strengthening these local community organizations can also be part of a strategy to build primary health care in general (Anders 2014). However, obtaining international support for grassroots initiatives is challenging. Most international funding is directed to EU or US organizations, which may have local initiatives and a history of working successfully in the area, but little funding is generally directed to local grassroots organizations or to the development of sustainable health infrastructure (Gundan 2014).",

So the WHO must be supported\u2014not just in words but with significant financial and material resources\u2014in order to meet the immediate challenges of new disease outbreaks and also to build the longer-term capacity of local public health agencies so that local units can function effectively and sustainably, since future outbreaks are inevitable in today\u2019s globalized world. This applies not only to the need to increase the supply of material resources needed for the emergency response, but also the training of local staff so that they can thwart the threat themselves.
