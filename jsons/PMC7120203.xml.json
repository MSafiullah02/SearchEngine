            "text": "Epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE), an enteric disease of domestic ferrets was first described in the USA in 1993 [1]. Clinically, the disease is characterized by a foul-smelling bright green diarrhea with high mucus content, lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting. Morbidity approaches 100 %, but mortality is usually below 5 %, with juvenile ferrets often developing only mild disease. ECE was found to be associated with an alphacoronavirus, designated ferret enteric coronavirus (FRECV) [2]. This disease or the enteric coronavirus agent associated with it has since spread in the USA and other countries worldwide [3\u20135]. Close to a decade after the recognition of ECE, a systemic disease, characterized by feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)-like clinical signs and lesions, began to emerge in ferrets across the USA and Europe [6\u20139]. Clinical findings include anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea and the presence of large palpable intra-abdominal masses. A marked resemblance to FIP is the gross observation of widespread whitish nodules on serosal surfaces and within the parenchyma of abdominal and thoracic organs. A systemic pyogranulomatous inflammation is the consistent histologic lesion observed in the affected organs, reminiscent of FIP. The agent associated with this disease, was found to be another alphacoronavirus, designated, ferret systemic coronavirus or FRSCV, and is most closely related to FRECV [6, 10]. The disease continues to spread worldwide with more recent reports from the UK, France and Japan [11\u201314].",

            "text": "Comparative sequence analysis of the distal one-third of the genomes of one FRSCV and one FRECV strain [10] showed that these two viruses share at least 96 % nucleotide sequence identities in the membrane, nucleocapsid and non-structural protein genes, ORFs 3 and 7b. However, their spike (S) proteins showed only 79.6 % amino acid sequence identity. This allowed the development of two S genotype-specific conventional [10], as well as real-time RT-PCR assays [15] for routine detection of these viruses in ourlaboratory. Limited preliminary data have shown that genotype 1 (FRSCV-like) ferret coronaviruses were found associated with the systemic type of illness while genotype 2 (FRECV-like) ferret coronaviruses were detected in cases of ECE [10]. Recent literature evidence indicates that there is no association between the S genotype and virus pathotype [4, 5]. The differentiating genotype-specific RT- PCR assays were recently used in a study that determined the prevalence of coronavirus among domestic ferrets in Japan [5]. The investigators noted that the majority of ferrets that were shedding the genotype 1 ferret coronavirus in feces were not ill with the systemic disease and that some were even asymptomatic. In the Netherlands, partial spike gene sequence analysis reported by Provacia et al. [4] showed that genotype 1 ferret coronavirus strains were also found present in feces of asymptomatic ferrets. These findings bring to mind the \u201cin vivo mutation\u201d theory proposed by Chang et al. [16] and Pedersen [17] for FIP-inducing feline coronavirus strains. It may well be the case for ferret coronaviruses that the virus commonly found in normal feces may just be the \u201cprecursor\u201d to a more pathogenic strain. Wise et al. [10] noted the presence of a truncated 3c-like protein gene in two out of three genotype 1 strains identified in ferrets with systemic disease, reminiscent of the 3c gene mutations identified in FIP viruses in cats [16\u201318].",

            "text": "\nPolymerase chain reaction ( PCR) is a method to amplify a fragment of double-stranded DNA to millions of copies, based upon repeated cycles of double-stranded DNA template denaturation, primer annealing and elongation. A primer is a short single-stranded DNA sequence, also called an oligonucleotide, that \u201cprimes\u201d the reaction at the appropriate annealing temperature by binding to the complementary sequence of the denatured DNA target. Using the deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs) in the reaction, the Taq polymerase enzyme then catalyzes the polymerization of nucleotides to polynucleotides beginning at the 3\u2032 end of the primer in the elongation step. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR) is used when the original target template is RNA, such that the RNA is first reverse-transcribed into \u201ccopy DNA,\u201d or cDNA, by the reverse transcriptase enzyme. The cDNA is then amplified in the PCR step. Conventional PCR/RT-PCR [19\u201322] requires the visualization of the amplified DNA or the PCR product, in an agarose gel matrix submerged in buffer through the process of electrophoresis. Electrophoresis subjects the PCR product to an electric current flow in the buffer that causes the DNA to migrate through the gel matrix according to its molecular weight. The PCR product is stained with an intercalating dye that fluoresces upon exposure to UV light, enabling its visualization alongside a DNA size marker ladder.",

With a hydrolysis probe-based real-time PCR, also called a \u201cTaqman\u201d-probe based assay, the amplification of DNA in every cycle results to a steady buildup of fluorescence signal in the reaction that can be detected using a specialized thermocycler with a built-in real-time nucleic acid detection system (e.g., Cepheid SmartCycler system). The probe, an essential component of the reaction mix, is a synthetic oligonucleotide with a sequence complementary to the target DNA flanked by the primers. The probe is labeled at its 5\u2032 end with a fluorescent reporter dye (e.g., FAM) and with a fluorescence quencher (e.g., BHQ-1) at its 3\u2032 end. There is no fluorescent signal emitted as long as the probe remains intact. In the presence of the specific target DNA in the reaction, after the primers and probe anneal to their complementary sequence, polymerization takes place in the elongation phase of the PCR cycle, during which the probe is degraded via the 5\u2032 exonuclease activity of the Taq DNA polymerase. Probe degradation leads to the release of the reporter dye from the probe and from its proximity to the quencher molecule, resulting to the accumulation of fluorescence signal in the reaction mix at every PCR cycle.",

Always handle with gloves, protective clothing and eyewear (personal protective gear).Buffer RLT contains guanidine thiocyanate. It is harmful by inhalation, in contact with skin, and if swallowed.When handling fresh animal tissues and feces, personal protective gear must be worn at all times and work must take place in Biosafety Level (BSL) 2 containment using a BSL 2 hood with the HEPA-filter blower on. The blower may be turned off once the specimens are inactivated in the RLT lysis buffer.For animals exhibiting FIP-like lesions, collect sections of grossly affected tissues (i.e., mesenteric adipose tissue and lymph nodes, lung, liver, and spleen). Tissue homogenization is optimally performed by rapid agitation in the presence of a bead or beads using a laboratory mixer mill. Alternatively (if a mixer mill is not available), 25 mg of tissue can be directly disrupted and homogenized in 750 \u03bcl of buffer RLT with \u03b2-ME in a microcentrifuge tube using a disposable RNAse-free pestle. The tube is then centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rpm (~2300 rcf for a 24-well microcentrifuge (i.e. Eppendorf Centrifuge 5417 C) to clarify the lysate. Transfer 700 \u03bcl of the lysate into a fresh tube, then proceed directly to step 5 (addition of 70 % EtOH) to continue with the RNA extraction.Buffer RW1 contains ethanol and therefore is flammable.Removal of residual RPE buffer in this step is crucial. The wash buffer contains EtOH which is inhibitory to PCR.Holding RNA samples at 4 \u00b0C or below prior to running the RT-PCR is very important to keep its integrity. This minimizes the chance of any trace contamination with ribonucleases (RNase enzymes) in the sample to be active and degrade the RNA.To minimize exposure of a PCR reaction to RNA/ DNA contamination that lead to false positives, it is optimal to designate a \u201cclean\u201d room where master mixes can be prepared separate from where nucleic acids are extracted and PCR templates added. Additionally designate \u201cclean\u201d pipettes for use solely for master mix preparation and dispensing, and negative control addition.The purpose of the negative control is to monitor the integrity of the master mix, ascertaining that it remains free of contaminating positive PCR template (no amplicon observed in the gel) for the run to be valid.It is best to use a positive control RNA template diluted sufficiently to a working concentration that produces only a moderately strong band/amplicon in the gel. This will minimize the production of large amounts of positive PCR products that build up over time in the environment and often lead to PCR contamination.Take care that the agarose solution does not boil over while melting it in the microwave. To prevent this from occurring, the microwave should be turned off immediately as bubbling starts to occur, the flask taken out and swirled for even mixing of the solution, then heated again in the microwave until the agarose is completely melted. Protective mitts must always be used when handling the flask with the heated/melted agarose.Ethidium bromide is a mutagenic substance. Always wear personal protective gear when working with this chemical.Before pulling out the combs, make sure that the agarose gel is already fully set. The gel at the bottom of the wells will get torn off as the comb is lifted out if the gel is not yet fully set. Prior to use, always check that the gel is intact at the bottom of every well. A hole in the bottom of the well will cause the loaded PCR product to leak out.If using gel combs with smaller teeth, decrease the amount of PCR product + loading dye to be applied, accordingly, to each well, taking care that the product does not overflow out of the well. Overflow will lead to contamination of the neighboring well which may lead to false positives.Bromophenol blue, a common loading dye, migrates at a rate similar to that of a 300 bp DNA fragment.Each SmartCycler II processing block or unit has 16 sites or wells. Each site or well is an independently controlled and programmable I-CORE (Intelligent Cooling/Heating Optical Reaction) module. Up to six blocks may be daisy-chained together and operated with a single computer, mimicking a 96-well reaction set-up. Each block gets designated a letter, from \u201cA\u201d to \u201cF\u201d, in a 6-block set-up.Alternatively, a graph may be created from scratch by clicking \u201cNew Graph\u201d at the bottom of the screen, assigning a name to the graph (e.g., FAM Amp curve), then selecting the options on the right depending on the purpose of the graph, then click \u201cSave Graph\u201d.Changing the \u201cUsage\u201d setting of the nonrelevant dyes, Cy3, TxR, and Cy5, from \u201cAssay\u201d to \u201cUnused\u201d will remove the data columns assigned for these dyes in the Results Table, leaving results displayed only for \u201cFAM\u201d, giving a more compact table of results.To chill a SmartCycler reaction tube rack, we recommend just keeping it in the refrigerator (4 \u00b0C) and not in the freezer.The Ct (cycle threshold) value is the PCR cycle number at which the fluorescence signal emitted by the generated PCR product is above background noise and crosses the manually set threshold line. The higher the amount of the starting target template in the sample, the lower the Ct value. A negative sample or control will not cross the threshold throughout the run and will have a Ct = 0. If the negative control shows a Ct > 0, this indicates that there is template contamination in the master mix, and hence the results of the run are not valid. The contamination issue should be addressed and the run repeated.\n",
