Here, with a focus on Israel, we sequenced 212 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and use them to perform a comprehensive analysis to trace the origins and spread of the virus. A phylogenetic analysis including thousands of globally sampled sequences allowed us to infer multiple independent introductions into Israel, followed by local transmission. Returning travelers from the U.S. contributed dramatically more to viral spread relative to their proportion in incoming infected travelers. Using phylodynamic analysis, we estimated that the basic reproduction number of the virus was initially around ~2.0-2.6, dropping by two-thirds following the implementation of social distancing measures. A comparison between reported and model-estimated case numbers indicated high levels of transmission heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 spread, with between 1-10% of infected individuals resulting in 80% of secondary infections. Overall, our findings underscore the ability of this virus to efficiently transmit between and within countries, as well as demonstrate the effectiveness of social distancing measures for reducing its spread.",

Shortly later, the etiological agent of the disease was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (Zhou, et al. 2020; Zhu, et al. 2020) , and the disease caused by the virus was named coronavirus disease 19 . The virus has since spread rapidly across the globe, causing a WHO-declared pandemic with social and economic devastation in many regions of the world. The infectious disease research community has quickly stepped up to the task of characterizing the virus and its replication dynamics, describing its pathogenesis, and tracking its movement through the human population. Parameterized epidemiological models have been particularly informative of how this virus has spread with and without control measures in place (e.g., Tian, et al. 2020) , and have been used to project viral spread both in the short-term (Flaxman, et al. 2020 ) and in the more distant future (Kissler, et al. 2020) .",

So-called \"genomic epidemiology\" allows for effective reconstruction of viral geographical spread as well as estimation of key epidemiological quantities such as the basic reproduction number of a virus, its growth rate and doubling time, and patterns of disease incidence and prevalence. Such insights have been used to inform policy makers during various pathogen outbreaks, as occurred for example in the 2014-2016 outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa (Khoury, et al. 2018; Armstrong, et al. 2019) , and during this current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (Bedford, et al. 2020; Fauver, et al. 2020 ).",

We sought to gain this understanding within the context of existing epidemiological knowledge, including that the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Israel were reported in early-February, followed by many identified SARS-CoV-2 cases in travelers returning to Israel mainly from Europe and the United States. Growth in the number of verified cases rapidly ensued, which led to increased measures of social distancing, including the cessation of passenger flights to Israel, school closure, and eventually a near complete lockdown across the entire state of Israel. Quarantining of returning travelers from Europe was implemented between February 26 and March 4, 2020, and subsequently all incoming travel to Israel was arrested on March 9. In the meantime, the rate of testing was ramped up, eventually reaching a rate of more than 1,500 tests per million people per day. The reported daily incidence and reported numbers of daily severe cases peaked around mid-April and have dropped steadily since then. Despite this knowledge, many questions remain: Which of the multiple SARS-CoV-2 introductions resulted in sustained local transmission? How did the virus spread across the state? What was the magnitude of the virus's reproduction potential within Israel, and to what extent did control measures mitigate its spread? Here, through a comprehensive set of phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses, we quantitatively address these questions.",

A total of 224 unique single nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified between the Wuhan reference sequence and this set of sequences from Israel. Figure 1 shows the distribution of identified SNVs along the genome and their counts in the sequenced samples. Of these SNVs, 141 were non-synonymous, 72 were synonymous, and the remaining 11 were in noncoding regions. One of the most abundantly detected SNVs was a non-synonymous variant D614G found in the spike protein, which was present in 90% of the sequences. This variant has generated much interest as it has been reported to potentially increase the transmissibility of the virus (Korber, et al. 2020) . Of note however, the alternative hypothesis that the observed increases in this variant's frequency is due to demographic considerations and genetic drift has not been ruled out. We also found five different high confidence genomic deletions, spanning between one and eighteen nucleotides (Fig. 2 ) (Methods), each of which was found in one to two samples. Three of these five deletions occurred in multiples of three and were in-frame deletions or affected non-coding regions. Of the remaining two deletions, deletion #3 spanned ten nucleotides, and likely prevents the translation of ORF7a. Deletion #4 occurred at the end of ORF8 and causes the replacement of the last amino acid with an additional five amino acids. Notably, an 81 nt in-frame deletion in ORF7a has been previously reported (Holland, et al. 2020) , as has been a 382 nt deletion in ORF8 (Su, et al. 2020) , suggesting that the virus is to some extent tolerant to deletions in these ORFs.",

Figure 3 shows the time-resolved phylogeny inferred using the 214 Israeli sequences (212 sequenced here and two additional ones sequenced previously) in addition to 4,693 representative sequences from across the world. This phylogeny allowed us to characterize the major viral clades circulating within Israel and to infer the geographic sources and timing of virus introductions into the state. We found multiple introductions into Israel from both the U.S and Europe, the latter including mainly the U.K., France and Belgium. Over 70% of the clade introductions into Israel (confidence intervals ranging from ~50% to ~80%, see Methods) were inferred to have occurred from the U.S., while the remaining were mainly from Europe. During the entire epidemic in Israel, very close monitoring of all incoming infected travelers was imposed, and reports show that only ~27% of infected returning travelers were from the U.S. The discrepancy between these estimated proportions suggests that the travelers returning from the U.S. contributed substantially more to the spread of the virus in Israel than would be proportionally expected. This may have occurred due to the gap in policy that allowed returning non-European travelers to avoid quarantine until March 9, or due to different contact patterns of those who returned from the U.S. Moreover, this suggests that had flights from the U.S. been arrested at the same time that flights from Europe were arrested (between February 26 and March 4, instead of by March 9), a substantial fraction of the transmission chains in Israel would have been prevented.",

However, many of these analyses have to date modeled reductions in RE as stemming from the depletion of susceptible individuals (Volz, Baguelin, et al. 2020) , rather than from reductions in R0, the latter of which would be consistent with lowering of contact rates. Other analyses, particularly those that use the birth-death model approach for phylodynamic inference, have allowed for changes in R0 over time (Danesh, et al. 2020; Vaughan, et al. 2020 ), but cannot as easily accommodate structure in the infected host population (e.g., that some individuals are exposed but not yet infectious, and that transmission heterogeneity exists between infected individuals). Our phylodynamic analysis here, based heavily on existing coalescent-based model structures that have been applied to SARS-CoV-2 (Volz 2020), instead allows for this structure to be accommodated and for R0 to change in a piecewise fashion over time.",

Recent epidemiological analyses have estimated considerable levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission heterogeneity, with ~7-10% of infected individuals estimated to be responsible for 80% of secondary infections (Bi, et al. 2020; Endo, et al. 2020) . Instead of assuming a given level of transmission heterogeneity for Israel, we instead performed phylodynamic inference of the SEIR model across a range of transmission heterogeneities ranging from ph = 1% to 20% of infected individuals being responsible for 80% of secondary infections. We estimated \" prior to March 19 to be approximately 2.0 across this superspreading range, with estimates increasing towards R0 = 2.4 to 2.6 at extremely high levels of superspreading (ph = 1-2%) ( Figure 5A ). Across this superspreading range, we robustly estimated that quarantine measures had the effect of reducing R0 by approximately two-thirds (a = ~30%; Figure 5B ; see Table S2 for model parameter priors and estimated values). Figure 5C shows the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 cases by April 22, estimated by our phylodynamic analyses across the considered superspreading range. Estimates of the cumulative number of cases is highly sensitive to the level of assumed transmission heterogeneity, particularly at high levels of superspreading (ph = 1-5%). Comparison between these inferred cumulative cases and reported case numbers (dotted line in Figure  5C ) indicates that SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics were driven by an extremely high level of viral superspreading. Specifically, if we assume almost complete case reporting, our phylodynamic analysis indicates that between 5-9% of infections are responsible for 80% of secondary infections; with lower assumed levels of case reporting, between 1-5% of infections would be responsible for this 80% of secondary infections.",

Inferred patterns of prevalence corroborate epidemiological findings that the number of cases started to decline in early April. Inferred patterns of cumulative incidence indicate that reporting rates were initially low, but improved considerably over the time course of viral spread. The 'leveling off' of cumulative incidence around late March/early April observed in both the reported case data and in our inferred epidemiological dynamics, ground-truthing the results of our phylodynamic analyses. .

We have hereby succeeded in tracking the main transmission chains that led to SARS-CoV-2 spread in Israel, and applied phylodynamic analysis to infer key epidemiological parameters governing its spread. Our results suggest that superspreading events are a main feature of SARS-CoV-2 spread, suggesting that focused measures to reduce contacts of select individuals/social events could dramatically mitigate viral spread. Finally our results highlight how global connectivity allows for massive introductions of a virus, and emphasize how border control and shelter-in-place restrictions are crucial for halting viral spread.",

Similarly positions to which no reads were mapped were also deemed uncertain, and such positions were assigned with an \"N\". All deletions were manually verified: (a) over 98% of the reads covering the deletion site mapped to both ends of the deletion (i.e, bore evidence of the deletions), (b) the deletion was based on over 40 independent reads (on average >1,000 reads), and (c) coverage was high at both ends of the deleted region.

In line with recent analyses (sarscov2.phylodynamics.org), we assumed that the epidemiological dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 were governed by Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) dynamics. Transmission heterogeneity has previously been described for viral pathogens including SARS-CoV-1 (Lloyd-Smith, et al. 2005 ) and appears to be important in the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 (Bi, et al. 2020; Endo, et al. 2020) .

We set the prior on to be uniform between 0 and 2, thereby allowing R0 to either increase, decrease, or remain unchanged after March 19. An exponential prior with mean 1.0 was used for the initial size of the class. The J and $ were assumed to be negligibly small at the beginning of the SEIR dynamics. The PhyDyn \" parameter was set to 2019.7 and a constant population size coalescent model was used prior to this date when proposed trees had earlier root dates. SEIR dynamics were assumed to begin on February 1 st . Sequences sampled from Israel were randomly assigned to $ with probability $ and to J with probability 1 \u2212 $ . XML files to run both BEAST2 and PhyDyn were generated using a custom Python 3 script which was designed to edit a template XML file originally generated with BEAUti and manually edited. MCMC chains for each parameter set were run for at least 1.9 million steps. Convergence was assessed based on visual inspection of parameter traces. Longer MCMC chains and additional replicates are currently being conducted. The first 50% of MCMC steps were discarded as burn-in. BEAST2 log and tree files were combined using LogCombiner. Maximum clade credibility trees were generated using TreeAnnotator. BEAST2 and PhyDyn outputs were visualized using Python 3, Matplotlib (Hunter 2007) , Seaborn, and Baltic (https://github.com/evogytis/baltic).",
