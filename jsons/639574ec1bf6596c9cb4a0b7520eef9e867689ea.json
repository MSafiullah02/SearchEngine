An important clinical consideration is the pathophysiology of myocarditis in COVID-19. There may be direct viral invasion or the disease may be an immune disease. 2,3 Finally, there is a possibility that the patient reported by Irabien-Ortiz et al. may have had a concurrent medical disorder such as another viral infection that could have induced the myocarditis.
