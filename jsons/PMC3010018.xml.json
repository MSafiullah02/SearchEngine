A study of interactions of a synthetic peptide representing the TM domain of HA with model membranes revealed that the peptide, which forms a coiled-coil in the membrane, increased the ordering of the lipids (15). Furthermore, it was recently reported that this TM peptide dehydrates the membranes (16). We previously showed that the FP of HA increases the ordering of the bilayer surface at acidic pH, implying that it also dehydrates the membranes (10). Consider the current hairpin model for viral membrane fusion (1\u20133), which holds that upon acidification, HA undergoes conformational changes, forming a hairpin structure. Its FP inserts into the cell membrane, and its TM domain is fixed at the viral membrane, thus bringing two membranes into close proximity. Consequently, the cell membrane is dehydrated by the FP, and the viral membrane is dehydrated by the TM, which would create a local hydrophobic zone right at the fusion site around the HA hairpins. We are particularly interested in what effects this local membrane dehydration might have on viral fusion.",

The spectra were analyzed with the use of a nonlinear least-squares (NLLS) fitting program (17) based on the stochastic Liouville equation (18,19). The spectral analysis generated two sets of parameters that characterize the rotational diffusion of the nitroxide radical in spin labels. The first set consists of R\u22a5 and R\u2016, which are respectively the rates of rotation of the nitroxide radical around a molecular axis perpendicular and parallel to the preferential orienting axis of the acyl chain. The second set consists of the ordering tensor parameters, S0 and S2, which are defined as follows: S0 = \u2329D2, 00\u232a= \u23291/2(3cos2\u03b8 \u2212 1\u232a, and S2 = \u2329D2, 02 + D2, 0-2\u232a, where D2, 00, D2, 02, and D2, 0-2 are the Wigner rotation matrix elements, and \u03b8 is the angle between the rotating axis of the nitroxide radical and the director of the bilayer (the preferential orientation of lipid molecules) (17,19). S0 indicates how strongly the chain segment to which the nitroxide is attached is aligned along the normal to the lipid bilayer. Because a change in S0 of the headgroup spin label is correlated with hydration/dehydration of the lipid bilayers (20), S0 is the most important parameter for this study. S2 is a measure of the molecular nonaxiality of the motion of the spin label. It was found to be much smaller than S0, with much less sensitivity to changes in bilayer structure induced by TM/lipid interactions. The estimated error from the NLLS fit for the spectra (the standard deviation of converged values of a fitted parameter) is \u00b10.01 for S0 of 5PC and 14PC, and \u00b10.006 for S0 of DPPTC, \u00b15% for R\u22a5. In general, the spectra, especially those from chain spin labels, are not very sensitive to R\u2016, so we obtained initial estimates of N \u2261 R\u2016/ R\u22a5 and fixed N in the final fits. This issue arises because R\u2016 is relatively large, and thus its effects on the spectrum are mostly averaged out (21,22). The estimated error is \u00b10.05 for the fraction of the spin label in each component spectrum in multiple-component spectral fits.",

(The spectrum with TM-wt/lipids = 1/75 is illustrated in Fig. SF1 of the Supporting Material.) These spectra were successfully simulated with two components with distinct order parameters. The S0 of the first component (0.55), which is independent of the concentration of TM-wt, is slightly higher than the S0 of 5PC in vesicles without TM-wt (0.52). The S0 of the second component is 0.61, 0.64, and 0.69 for the spectra with TM-wt/lipids of 1/100, 1/88, and 1/75, respectively. These values are > 0.59, the order parameter of 5PC at 24.0\u00b0C in the gel phase-like domains in pure DMPC bilayers (data not shown). These gel phase-like domains coexist with the liquid crystal phase domains near its main phase transition (23). The second component is less abundant than the first one, with a relative population of 0.21, 0.26, and 0.32, respectively, for the three spectra with the high concentration of TM-wt. Note in Fig. 1\nB that the values of S0 of 5PC for the spectra with TM-wt/lipids of 1/100, 1/88, and 1/75 are averaged order parameters over their two components. It is likely that the spectra of DPPTC and 14PC from the vesicles with high concentrations of TM-wt also consist of two components, but they are not resolved. These results indicate that at high concentrations of TM-wt, highly ordered membrane domains are induced in DMPC/DMPG/Chol = 40/30/30 membranes.",

When DMPG was completely removed (i.e., in DMPC/Chol = 70/30), the S0 of 14PC decreased only as TM-wt was incorporated (dashed line in Fig. 2\nB). It can be seen that lowering the concentration of DMPG reduces the membrane ordering effect of TM-wt, and in the vesicles without DMPG incorporation of TM-wt, it only disorders the membrane. (We could not obtain ESR signals from DPPTC in vesicles with a concentration of DMPG < 30% after TM-wt was incorporated; therefore, no results regarding the dependence of S0 of DPPTC on the concentration of DMPG in these vesicles are presented).",

The amount of PI in LLE is 8% (Avanti, http://www.avantilipids.com). Assuming that the relative amounts of negatively charged lipids in mast cell membrane and in LLE are not significantly different, the content of PG in LLE would likely be <8%. Thus, the comparable membrane ordering effects by TM-wt in LLE and in DMPC/DMPG/Chol = 40/30/30 may imply that in LLE not only the electrostatic interactions of TM-wt with PG but also those with PI and PS contribute to the membrane ordering effect of TM-wt, i.e., the electrostatic interaction between TM-wt and DMPG is not specific.",

This alignment allows two positively charged amino acid residues, the lysine near the N-terminus and the arginine near the C-terminus (both located at the interface of the bilayer), to interact with the negatively charged headgroups in the vesicles. We are more interested in the interactions of lipids with the lysine than with the arginine, for two reasons. First, the N-terminus lysine residue of TM in HA is positioned near the surface of the outer leaflet of the viral membrane, whereas the C-terminus arginine residue is positioned near the surface of the inner leaflet of the viral membrane. Thus, the former can have a more direct effect on interactions between the viral and target membranes during viral fusion than the latter. Second, lysine is a highly conserved residue in amino acid sequences of the TM in HA of influenza, but the arginine is not (15). We substituted the lysine with a negatively charged residue glutamic acid and incorporated the mutated peptide (TM-mut1) into MLVs of DMPC/DMPG/Chol = 40/30/30. We found that at pH 7 and 37\u00b0C, the S0 of all three spin labels in the vesicles hardly changed with the concentration of TM-mut1 in the vesicles (dotted lines in Fig. 1, A\u2013C). Thus, the N-terminus lysine is important for the membrane ordering effect by TM-wt.",

We found that incorporation of the mutated peptide (TM-mut2) into MLVs of LLE had no effect on the ordering of the three spin labels in the vesicles (dotted lines in Fig. 3, A\u2013C), indicating that the leucine residue near the N-terminus is also important for the membrane ordering effect of TM-wt.

For 5PC, a spin-labeled PC, the interaction of its zwitterionic headgroup with TM-wt is weaker than the electrostatic interactions of the negatively charged headgroups with TM-wt. Thus, 5PC would be less favorably partitioned into the highly ordered membrane domains. That is, the actual amount of lipids contained in the highly ordered membrane domains may be more than 20\u201330% of that in the whole membrane, but it is not likely to be > 50% of the total lipids. This means that these membrane domains may exist as discrete regions dispersed in the vesicle membranes. Because the ordering of the membrane outside these highly ordered membrane domains is the same as or only slightly higher than the ordering of the membrane without TM-wt in LLE and DMPC/DMPG/Chol = 40/30/30 vesicles, the membrane ordering effect of TM-wt is localized in these discrete domains. Given the correlation of increased membrane ordering with membrane dehydration, we also suggest that these domains are highly dehydrated (20,26,27).",

On the basis of the observed correlation between membrane ordering (dehydration) and LLE vesicle aggregation, we propose the following mechanism for TM-induced vesicle aggregation: 1) To reduce exposure of the hydrophobic domain surfaces to the aqueous solution, aggregation of LLE vesicles would most likely occur between these membrane domains. 2) Two aggregated LLE vesicles are connected by a water capillary bridge between two highly ordered membrane domains, as illustrated in Fig. 5. A capillary bridge of a liquid (water or a solvent) will form when two surfaces (plane or curved surface), which are wetted by the liquid, are brought close together (the liquid-air interface is a meniscus, hence the capillary bridge (32,33)). 3) Because of the correlation between the ordering of the headgroups and the ordering of the membrane surface water (27), the water on the surface of the highly ordered membrane domains is also highly ordered. Thus, the water capillary bridge between two highly ordered membrane domains (green in Fig. 5) is made up of the highly ordered water on the membrane domain surface that is interfaced with the surrounding nonordered bulk water (blue in Fig. 5). The orientations of the water molecules and hydrogen-bonding structure in the two water phases are significantly different (27).",

According to the Young-Laplace equation, \u0394p = 2\u03b3/R, which relates the pressure differences across the interface, \u0394p, with \u03b3 and R (the principal radius of the interface meniscus), the pressure inside the bridge is anisotropic. That is, the pressure along the direction of the symmetry axis of the bridge is negative due to the negative principal curvature 1/R1, whereas the pressure in all directions perpendicular to the axis is positive due to the positive principal curvature 1/R2. This surface tension effect, a boundary condition for the mechanical equilibrium of the water capillary bridge, is consistent with the Maxwell stress tensor inside the bridge, which has a negative z-component (a stretching force along the symmetry axis of the bridge), and positive x- and y-components (compressing forces). This stress tensor is generated by an electric field inside the bridge as a result of polarization of water molecules, i.e., due to the preferential orientation of electric dipoles of water molecule along the axis of the bridge (27). The capillary negative pressure in water capillary bridge 108 nm high observed in silicon-based nanochannels was previously estimated to be \u223c\u221217 \u00b1 10 bar (34). The attractive forces in the water bridge between two LLE vesicles would probably be much larger than this value because the distance between the two aggregated LLE vesicles is <10 nm, as revealed in our transmission electron micrographs (data not shown).",

Conceivably, a very strong attractive force that is highly localized in the apposed membrane region between the vesicle and the virus particle is responsible for such a dramatic vesicle membrane deformation. This raises the question as to how this force is generated.",

In the prehairpin state, the FP is inserted into the cellular membrane and the TM domain is anchored in the viral membrane, such that two membranes are connected (1\u20133). Insertion of FP dehydrates the cellular membrane around the FP (10). On the other hand, it is likely that the highly ordered membrane domains induced by TM-wt that we observed in membranes containing negatively charged lipids may also exist in the viral membrane, so that the viral membrane around the HA trimers would be dehydrated. Now we would like to extend our suggested mechanism for vesicle aggregation to viral fusion. We suggest that in the prehairpin state, a highly ordered water capillary bridge may form between the dehydrated cellular and viral membranes around the HA hairpins. The attractive forces in the water capillary bridge, which pull the two membranes together, facilitate the conformational change of HA trimers from a prehairpin to a complete hairpin. These forces would be the same as those observed in the initial stage of fusion between PC vesicles and influenza virus particles mentioned above (35). They are hydrophobic forces between the locally dehydrated membranes due to changes in the structure of membrane surface water and headgroups induced by HA-lipid interactions. They are not likely generated only as a result of conformational changes of HA, as suggested by a spring-loaded mechanism (36).",
