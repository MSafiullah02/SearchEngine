However, the opposite has happened in other countries (Fig 1) . Just this past week, the number of affected countries shot up from 37 to 61 and the number of new cases reported each day are growing exponentially.

Another limitation is that we used the time-series data of confirmed cases to calculate according to the official date of diagnosis. So, the date we estimated that the R t went below one should be delayed by about 10~17 days (the incubation period of 7 days added days from onset to diagnosis of 10 days). Although we estimated the time when the epidemic was under control had a delay than the actual time, it could still provide information of the trend of the epidemic.",
