The pandemic, caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is rapidly leading to saturation of intensive care units and inpatient beds. The need for full-time physicians and nurses dedicated to patients with COVID-19 is requiring fast and complex reorganisation of clinical activities in many divisions, including IBD units.2, 3\n",

Indeed, a systematic review4 showed that the risk of hospital admission (odds ratio 0\u00b748, 95% CI 0\u00b729\u20130\u00b780) and surgery (0\u00b767, 0\u00b746\u20130\u00b797) is significantly reduced by use of biologics for patients with IBD. The probability of relapse after stopping effective immunomodulators or biological therapy is about 50% and is associated with an increased need for steroids, and risk of hospital admission and surgery.5\n",

First, SARS-CoV-2 infection should be considered as a serious rather than an opportunistic infection, as the risk of infection is not related to concomitant immunosuppression. Second, severe COVID-19 might be associated with cytokine storm and is possibly related to a hyper-immune response in addition to virus-related damage. Third, around 5% of patients who relapse because of withdrawal of effective therapies will require hospital admission against a backdrop of overwhelmed hospital capacity. Thus, the risk and benefits of continuing or stopping biologics should be carefully balanced and should not be assumed to be a general rule for all patients with IBD, especially given the length of time the pandemic is likely to last.",
