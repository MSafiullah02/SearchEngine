Due to their versatile metabolisms, Paracoccus species are considered as important organisms for bioremediation and are suggested to be involved in degrading and removing refractory pollutants such as 4-chlorophenol from wastewater (Gomez-Acata et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 2015). Several Paracoccus species can carry out denitrification, and are frequently isolated from denitrifying reactor (Neef et al. 1996; Shi et al. 2013). In addition, P. denitrificans is isolated from microbial fuel cell anode biofilm communities and can generate electricity using formic acid as an electron donor (Kiely et al. 2010). Furthermore, P. denitrificans can be immobilized in gels with Nitrosomonas europaea for efficient nitrogen removal from wastewater and have great potentials in their applications (Kokufuta et al. 1988; Uemoto and Saiki 1996). Hence, understanding biofilm formation in Paracoccus species may optimize the functions of biofilm-based bioreactors.",

            "text": "Biofilms are generally a thick layer of cells where microcolonies with mushroom-like structures or mound-like structures could often be observed inside. The thick layer and metabolic activity of cells form microenvironments in biofilms, with micro-scale gradients or patches of chemicals, such as electron acceptors and donors, nutrients, pH, and cell-to-cell communication signals (Flemming et al. 2016). The biofilm architecture could be highly organized, even including water channels to facilitate the transport of liquids (Wilking et al. 2013). One of the remarkable features of P. denitrificans biofilm is that it forms a very thin and flat biofilm with less than \u223c4 \u03bcm thickness in a liquid-air interface (Yoshida et al. 2017), making it an interesting model for biofilm formation as compared to other model organisms such as P. aeruginosa that form multilayered biofilms (Heydorn et al. 2002; Sauer et al. 2002) Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analysis showed that the cells in the biofilm are often densely packed and frequently arranged in chains (Yoshida et al. 2017). Since P. denitrificans is non-motile, it is suggested that the cells spread on the surface by cell division, resulting in dense biofilms with chains of cells. Similarly, a monolayer biofilm is also observed in another Paracoccus species which biofilm morphology changes depending on the culture conditions (Srinandan et al. 2010).",

            "text": "Given the thin layer of cells and lack of motility, initial attachment would have more direct impact on the biofilm structure in P. denitrificans compared to other bacteria that undergo several stages to finally form a mature biofilm. Bacteria secrete various types of EPS to adhere to surfaces and form biofilms. The main EPS components are polysaccharides, proteins, lectins, and nucleic acids (Flemming and Wingender 2010; Schooling and Beveridge 2006). Bacteria often produce several types of EPS that interact with each other and play different roles in forming biofilms. For example, V. cholerae produces an extracellular Vibrio polysaccharide (VPS), biofilm-associated protein 1 (Bap1), and the matrix proteins, rugosity and biofilm structure modulator A (RbmA) and rugosity and biofilm structure modulator C (RbmC) (Berk et al. 2012; Yan et al. 2016). VPS in the biofilms maintain the 3-dimensional biofilm structure by accumulation between cells, whereas Bap1 acts as cell-to-surface adhesion and RbmA functions as cell-to-cell linkage. Bap is a group of proteins that are monomeric repetitive adhesins. Baps in Gram-negative bacteria are repeats-in-toxin (RTX) family of proteins and composed of three domains: N-termini, core large repeats and C-termini (Satchell 2011). Molecular sizes of Baps vary, ranging from 1873 to 8682 amino acids (aa), depending on the core repeat sequences (Lasa and Penades 2006). Baps are localized at cell surfaces and mediate cell-to-surface and/or cell-to-cell adhesion. In Gram-negative bacteria, Baps are secreted directly from the cytoplasm to extracellular space by their ABC transporters known as Type I secretion system. RTX adhesins contain glycine-aspartate-rich peptide repeats at the C-termini and each peptide binds to a calcium ion (Satchell 2011), which is important at least for some Baps to function (Martinez-Gil et al. 2012). One of the best studied Bap proteins in Gram-negative bacteria is LapA, which is involved in cell adhesion of Pseudomonas fluorescens (Hinsa et al. 2003).",

            "text": "An analysis of EPS components in P. denitrificans using EPS-degrading enzymes suggested that an extracellular proteinaceous component influences biofilm formation (Yoshida et al. 2017). In line with this observation, the biofilm formation of P. denitrificans requires BapA for its initial cell attachment (Kumar and Spiro 2017; Yoshida et al. 2017). BapA protein of P. denitrificans contains a large repeat region consisting of 891 tandem repeats of aspartate and alanine although the precise roles of this extremely acidic sequence are still unknown. This repeat sequence is unique to this protein, while other Baps typically contain 80 to 300 aa repeat unit sequences (Satchell 2011). BapA protein of P. denitrificans is secreted extracellularly by Type I secretion system BapBCD. BapA is localized at the cell surface and makes the cell surface more hydrophobic, which presumably drives cells to attach to the substratum (Yoshida et al. 2017). It was further shown that BapA is a calcium-binding protein and it is necessary for cell attachment (Kumar and Spiro 2017). Consistent with these results, divalent cations are shown to enhance biofilm formation in a Paracoccus species and EDTA treatment can detach biofilm formation (Srinandan et al. 2010).",

            "text": "BapA protein regulation in P. denitrificans is not well studied, but nitric oxide (NO) has been reported to control the BapA level that partially involves cyclic diguanosine monophosphate (cyclic-di-GMP). Cyclic-di-GMP is an intracellular second messenger involved in biofilm formation of many bacteria by controlling EPS production and motility. For example, in P. aeruginosa, accumulation of cyclic-di-GMP downregulates cell motility and upregulates EPS production (Valentini and Filloux 2016). Low concentration of cyclic-di GMP due to degradation by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) induces cell dispersal from biofilms. The intracellular cyclic di-GMP level is controlled by its synthesis by diguanylate cyclase (DGC), and degradation by PDE.

DgcB has an N-terminal response regulator domain, implying a signal cascade from a sensor partner. dgcA overlaps with a gene coding a protein that has heme-nitric oxide/oxygen binding (H-NOX) domain. H-NOX protein commonly functions as a sensor for the gaseous signaling agent nitric oxide (NO) (Plate and Marletta 2013), suggesting that H-NOX protein in P. denitrificans regulates the biosynthesis of cyclic-di GMP. P. denitrificans produces NO as an intermediate of denitrification. Kumar and Spiro showed that NO stimulates biofilm formation in P. denitrificans (Kumar and Spiro 2017). Using a series of mutants, they showed that altering the NO and cyclic-di GMP levels controls the abundance of BapA protein on the cell envelope and biofilm formation. It is suggested that NO controls biofilm formation via both H-NOX/cyclic-di-GMP dependent and independent pathways. In other bacteria, NO often leads to biofilm dispersal (Arora et al. 2015; Barraud et al. 2009), and the opposite reaction or tolerance against NO could be one of the reasons why Paracoccus species become abundant in denitrifying reactors (Singh et al. 2015).",

AHL consists of a lactone ring and an N-acyl side chain whose length ranges from 4 to 20 carbons, which may have additional modifications (Arashida et al. 2018). P. denitrificans produces N-hexadecanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C16-HSL) as its QS signal (Schaefer et al. 2002), which is synthesized by a luxI homolog, pdnI (Toyofuku et al. 2017). The pdnI mutant strongly aggregates and forms a thick biofilm in comparison to the wildtype, indicating that QS down-regulates aggregation in P. denitrificans (Morinaga et al. 2018). It suggests that C16-HSL regulates EPS production, and this relation, once verified, would provide a direct link between QS and biofilm formation.",

While P. denitrificans does not respond to short-chain AHLs (C4 to C8-HSL) alone, when C4- and C6-HSL are present together with C16-HSL, it can modulate the threshold concentration and less C16-HSL is required to inhibit cell aggregation of the pdnI mutant. On the other hand, more C16-HSL is required to inhibit aggregation in the presence of C8 and C10-HSL. Such interaction with other signals suggests how this bacterium forms biofilm in a polymicrobial community.",

MVs are involved in various bacterial and host-bacterial interactions and are also used as a platform for therapeutics such as vaccine development (Toyofuku et al. 2015). MVs isolated from P. denitrificans can induce QS targeted gene expression and can also regulate cell aggregation by delivering C16-HSL (Toyofuku et al. 2017). Furthermore, one MV contains a much higher amount of C16-HSL than the threshold concentration that would induce gene expression in a P. denitrificans cell. Signals packed in MVs would lead to binary signaling, where QS is triggered only in cells that receive MVs, out of the whole cell population. In addition, the calling distance of this digital signaling system would be longer than the free diffusion of signals, as packaging in MVs would prevent the signals from being diluted below the threshold concentration. MVs released from P. denitrificans also show a propensity of cell targeting and have a high affinity to kin species than other species such as P. aeruginosa and P. putida (Toyofuku et al. 2017) (Fig. 2). MVs can also absorb free long-chain AHLs from the environment that can be utilized by P. denitrificans (Morinaga et al. 2018). Hence, MVs are involved in trafficking signals that lead to different socioecological consequences. The delivery of hydrophobic signals by MVs is also reported in other bacteria (Brameyer et al. 2018; Feitosa-Junior et al. 2019; Mashburn and Whiteley 2005) and could be a general way to disperse the signals.",

Further understanding of environmental factors that control cyclic-di-GMP levels and QS, together with identification of QS-regulated biofilm formation factors, could be key in understanding biofilm formation. In addition, BapA protein, the key factor in the surface attachment of this bacterium, alters the hydrophobicity of the cells, and it would be of interest to examine the influence of BapA expression on MV delivery and C16-HSL signaling in biofilms. One of the advantages of keeping the biofilm thin is that each cell in the biofilm has more access to nutrients than in thick biofilms. However, this aspect is yet to be explored in detail. Biofilm thickness is a key property of its function (Suarez et al. 2019), and optimizing the uptake of nutrients by biofilms could be applied to industries including wastewater treatment process using biofilms. P. denitrificans has great potentials in its application for biotechnology, and understanding its biofilm formation may ultimately lead to optimize its functionality.",
