            "text": "Seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines have traditionally been made from inactivated virus grown in embryonated eggs. However, this approach has several limitations including manufacturing delays while vaccine seed viruses are egg-adapted and insecurity of egg supply with potential of supply disruption if pandemic virus also infects chicken flocks. Egg-based vaccines may also not be suitable for individuals with severe egg allergies.1 Despite more recent development of large-scale facilities for mammalian cell culture of influenza virus,2 this remains susceptible to delays while seed viruses suitable for cell culture are generated and screened. The predictability and speed of recombinant protein manufacture are major advantages for vaccine production. A potentially more reliable approach to pandemic vaccine production, therefore, is the use of recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA). Protective neutralising antibodies to HA are seen after influenza infection or immunization.3,4 The US government awarded contracts to a range of vaccine companies including Protein Sciences Corporation (PSC), Medicago, Novovax, Fraunhofer Institute, and Vaxinnate to produce recombinant influenza vaccines using various techniques.5 PSC pioneered the use of the baculovirus expression system to produce influenza vaccine based on rHA (Flublok\u00ae), which was licensed by the FDA in 2013 for seasonal influenza protection in adults.6 The pandemic variant of this rHA vaccine is known as Panblok\u00ae. While Panblok protected birds against lethal H5 or H7 infection,7 only low levels of seroprotection were obtained in human subjects indicating the need for an adjuvant.8",

It was first detected in North America in April 2009 and spread rapidly around the world, leading to a declaration by the World Health Organization of a global pandemic on June 11, 2009.28 The new influenza virus was at least as contagious as seasonal influenza and spread quickly, particularly among younger people. Some degree of pre-existing immunity was seen in older adults especially those aged over 60, possibly due to previous exposure to antigenically related influenza A viruses. Recent seasonal influenza vaccines (2005\u20132009 provided minimal protection against the novel pandemic strain.29 While the 2009 pandemic was not as severe as initially feared, it did cause an upsurge in hospital and intensive care unit admissions for severe respiratory illness, hypoxemia, multi-organ failure and requirement for ventilator support.30 Given the need for rapid development of pandemic vaccines, a variety of approaches were utilised involving inactivated and live attenuated vaccines. We used an alternative approach to develop a vaccine using recombinant hemagglutinin from H1N1/2009pdm combined with Advax delta inulin adjuvant (Panblok-H1/Advax vaccine).26",

The influenza vaccine seed strain initially distributed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was A/H1N1/California/04/2009. (Source: CDC ID number 2009712047; Passage 1 MDCK cells). Although this strain subsequently provided unsatisfactory egg production yields delaying vaccine manufacture while an alternative higher-yield strain was identified, PSC had already cloned the HA from the A/California/04/2009 virus RNA as a template using a reverse transcriptase PCR reaction (RT-PCR) to generate cDNA which was cloned into a baculovirus transfer vector and then used to transfect Spodoptera frugiperda (expres SF+\u2122) (SF+) insect cells using calcium phosphate precipitation with linearized Autographa californica multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). The clones were sequenced to compare their sequence to the published CDC A/H1N1/California/04/2009 HA sequence but no perfect match was found, a situation that is not uncommon in initial cloning of seasonal influenza strains. Several clones had a Proline at position 200 (Pro200) in the HA1 domain, a variant that also appears in other H1N1 viruses (Supplementary Figure 1). Position 200 in the HA1 domain maps near the distal tip involved in receptor binding according to the predicted HA crystal structure (Supplementary Figure 2). To ensure 100% consistency with the CDC published sequence of A/California/04/2009 (Acc# FJ966082) that had a Serine at position 200 (Ser200), site directed mutagenesis was performed on the baculovirus clones to change the Pro200 to a Ser200. Both Pro200 and Ser200 rHA protein variants were then manufactured so that their behavior could be studied.\n\n\n",

To better understand the unusual behavior of the A/California/04/2009 virus and, in particular, the differences in behavior of the Pro200 vs. Ser200 rHA, we generated a homology model of A/California/04/2009 HA using Modeler, a homology modeling program, using a crystal structure of an earlier HA protein, 3AL4.pdb, as a template. This was then used to conduct receptor binding analysis using the molecular docking program, Autodock vina, with binding energies of the Pro200 vs. Ser200 rHA calculated for both avian and human sialic acid receptors. These binding studies confirmed that the Pro200 \u2192Ser200 substitution had a significant impact on the predicted binding conformation of the HA head region to avian and human sialic acid receptors (Fig. 1, top panels). The predicted binding energy of the Ser200 HA variant for both the human and avian sialic acid receptors was lower than the binding energy of Pro200 HA (Table 1), which could help explain the lack of RBC agglutination activity of the Ser200 rHA variant. The model further showed the Pro200 \u2192Ser200 HA mutation altered the binding mode of the HA head to the sialic acid receptors. Having Ser200 allowed formation of H-bonds between Ser200 and sialic acid causing the receptor molecule to move toward the \u03b1 helix and lose contact with Y104 (Fig. 1, bottom panels). Since Ser200 is located above the H192 that forms the base of the pocket, H-bonding between Ser200 and sialic acid prevents the receptor contacting the base of the binding pocket and interacting with H192. This may cause the HA to bind its receptor with a reduced affinity. Furthermore, since the receptor is not entering deep into the binding pocket, entry of water will hydrate potential contact sites and further reduce the stability of the interaction. In contrast, Pro200 loses the H-bonding ability of this position with sialic acid and as a result the receptor can now form H-bonds with the base of the pocket (H192 and Y104). Furthermore, since the receptor is now capable of entering deep into the pocket potential hydration of H-bonding sites is avoided and this may result in a more stable binding of the Pro200 HA with its receptor.\n\n",

Despite the Ser200 rHA antigen having no agglutination activity in vitro, when used to immunise mice it still induced antibodies (Fig. 2) able to neutralise the agglutination activity of the Pro200 rHA variant which retained agglutination activity as well as the agglutination activity of a local pandemic virus isolate named SF3 strain that was characterized as an A/California/07/2009-like virus. SF3 was isolated from a patient admitted to Flinders Medical Center in South Australia with acute influenza infection. The isolate was propagated in MDCK cells and the HA gene sequenced and confirmed to match the published H1N1/2009pdm sequence. The immune sera from Ser200 rHA immunized mice was also able to neutralise the HA activity of a commercial inactivated A/California/07/2009-like vaccine (Panvax\u2122, CSL, Australia). Notably, addition of Advax adjuvant to the Ser200 rHA resulted in a significant increases in both anti-influenza serum IgG1 and IgG2a levels in immunised mice.

Surprisingly, the 2 variant rHA sequences produced during the initial baculovirus cloning that contained Pro200 in the receptor-binding site did have potent RBC agglutination activity. To assess its suitability for use as an antigen in HI assays, we tested the Pro200 rHA for recognition by a reference ferret hyperimmune sera to A/California/07/2009 (BEI No. NR-15429, NIH).

As previously reported, HI assay results are highly dependent on both the actual HA antigen as well as the species of RBC used, making international standardisation of such assays problematic. High inter-assay variability may help explain the markedly different baseline estimates of H1N1/2009pdm seroprotection reported by various laboratories around the world. Indeed, we obtained different estimates of baseline seroprotection rates in our study population depending on which HA antigen we used for the HI assays. The lowest baseline seroprotection estimate for the HI assays were obtained when using the SF3 antigen, then inactivated A/California/07/2009 grown in eggs, and with the highest estimate obtained using the Pro200 rHA (data not shown). Importantly, while the different HA antigens provided different estimates of baseline seroprotection, the fold-change in pre- to post-immunisation HI titers in study subjects was highly correlated between the 3 different HA antigens (data not shown).

In addition to HI activity, MNT assays detect antibodies that block other vital virus functions including fusion and nucleic acid unwrapping.36 HI and MNT results were compared at baseline and post the second immunisation in the groups that received 45\u03bcg Panblok-H1 with or without Advax adjuvant. At baseline, most samples had low or undetectable HI titres, although many were positive by the MNT assay, indicating the HI assay had a lower sensitivity than the MNT assay. There was consequently only a very weak correlation between baseline HI and MNT results in each individual (Fig. 3A), with many subjects with undetectable HI titres having positive MNT titres against H1N1/2009pdm. This suggests that MNT can identify subjects who despite being negative by HI nevertheless have seroprotective levels of neutralising non-HI antibodies. Interestingly, post-immunization there was a much stronger positive correlation between HI and MNT levels in each subject (Fig. 3B), suggesting the vaccine induced similar proportions of both HI and MNT antibodies. Advax adjuvant had equally favorable effects on both HI and MNT responses with the mean fold increase in HI and MNT being \u223c2\u20133-fold higher when compared with Panblok-H1 alone.34\n\n",

The MNT assay detects neutralising antibodies targeting the HA stem that thereby neutralise both homologous and heterologous strains,36 whereas HI assays only detect neutralising antibodies directed against the HA head and hence are specific to homologous virus. As expected from the differences in the sequences of the HA head region, FLU005 study subjects showed no increase in HI against heterologous A/PR8 or A/X31 viruses, post-immunization (Fig. 4, left side).

A seasonal vaccine (Flublok\u00ae) based on insect-cell expressed rHA was at the time of the 2009 pandemic still awaiting FDA approval but has since been licensed in the USA for use in adult subjects. 2009 presented a rare opportunity to test this novel rHA vaccine technology in the context of a real-life pandemic. The baculovirus expression technology used to produce Panblok-H1/Advax was extremely fast as it avoided the need for creation of egg- or cell culture adapted influenza viruses. Indeed, development of Panblok-H1/Advax was performed in just 3 months from initial virus identification to first human trial dose administered, making this potentially one of the fastest vaccine development programs in history. Surprisingly, when rHA was expressed from the initial CDC recommended A/California/04/2009 reference sequence it did not show any agglutination activity. This is not a unique occurrence as one of the complexities of the study of influenza viruses is that some variants have limited receptor recognition, with several alternative structural mechanisms existing for adaptation of binding properties and with a broad range of HA residues having the ability to influence receptor binding. Furthermore, as the ability of HA to agglutinate RBC relies on its ability to multimerize we speculate that another potential reason for the failure of the Ser200 rHA to agglutinate RBC could be that this variant failed to assemble properly in HA timers and rosettes needed for agglutination activity. Hence, it had both a lower avidity for sialic acid receptors but also was unable to cross-link them to induce RBC agglutination. The CDC subsequently issued a different vaccine seed strain, A/California/07/2009, which was later used in manufacture of inactivated H1N1/2009 vaccines, and also by PSC in manufacture of a A/California/07/2009 rHA for inclusion in their 2010 and subsequent year seasonal trivalent Flublok vaccines. Ironically during original mnufacture the A/California/04/2009 rHA gene had spontaneously reverted during cloning to Pro200 sequences with agglutination activity but following the procedure used for seasonal influenza vaccine manufacture, the HA sequence was mutated back to the CDC A/California/04/2009 Ser200 reference sequence which had the agglutination problem. Imposing a further delay on vaccine delivery was the requirement for a 29-day mycoplasma culture to allow lot release. In future, it should be possible to use the FDA-approved 14-day PCR mycoplasma assay thereby removing 2 weeks from the time needed for vaccine release. Nevertheless, despite these challenges Panblok/Advax was the first H1N1/2009 vaccine in the world to become available for clinical testing, and in the FLU005 trial was confirmed to be immunogenic, safe and well tolerated.",

We reported the study results using the wild-type SF3 virus, an A/California/07/2009-like virus isolated from a local patient with pandemic influenza. This may have understated the overall seroprotection levels reported for Panblok-H1/Advax relative to other reported vaccines. Furthermore, whereas many other pandemic vaccine studies included mainly young healthy subjects, our study included an extremely high proportion of elderly, obese and chronic disease subjects and this likely negatively impacted on our overall seroprotection levels. Subjects over 50 y of age have been reported elsewhere to have lower influenza vaccine responses.37,38 Hence direct comparisons are difficult of HI titers between different studies with results being highly dependent on the assay and antigen used.39 Furthermore, seroprotection rates measured by HI assay likely understate total protection particularly when compared with MNT assays. MNT assays provide a more sensitive measure of seroprotection given their ability to also detect antibodies that target other important viral epitopes such as the stem region involved in viral fusion.40 The H1N1/2009pdm MNT assay provided a much higher estimate of baseline immunity to H1N1/2009pdm across the study population, as many subjects that had a negative HI were seropositive by MNT assay. Advax adjuvant induced a \u223c3-fold increase in MNT tters vs. \u223c2-fold higher titers by HI assay. While the HI assay did not detect any vaccine effects on heterologous antibodies against the A/PR8 or A/X31 virus strains, the more sensitive MNT assay showed that Panblok-H1/Advax induced seroconversion against A/PR8 in \u223c2/5th of the trial subjects. This raises the possibility that Panblok-H1/Advax induced HA stem antibodies in some subjects. As stem antibodies confer broad cross-protection against heterologous influenza viruses, this will be an important area for future study. The ability of Advax adjuvant to induce broader cross-protective responses has been seen in animal studies where formulation of an inactivated Japanese encephalitis virus antigen with Advax resulted in robust cross-protection against heterologous flaviviruses including Murray Valley Encephalitis and West Nile virus.17 This enhanced protection was transferrable from immunised to na\u00efve mice using memory B cells, suggesting Advax enhances production of broadly cross-protective memory B cells. Recent human influenza studies showed that subjects that received Advax-adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine had a higher day 7 post-immunisation plasmablast responses and enhanced expression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase translating into greater antibody avidity and CDR3 complexity.41",

Furthermore, inactivated virus vaccines contain contaminants including viral RNA and neuraminidase and nuclear protein that act as inbuilt adjuvants.43 Inactivated influenza vaccines lose their immunogenicity when administered to toll-like receptor (TLR)-7 knockout mice, thereby demonstrating the importance of viral RNA to innate immune activation and vaccine immunogenicity.44 Panblok-H1 alone or together with Advax adjuvant was very well tolerated. The most common local reaction was injection site discomfort with other local reactions such as bruising, redness, and swelling with most of local reactions being low grade. Surprisingly, post-immunisation headaches were significantly lower in subjects that received Advax adjuvant (2.9%) compared with Panblok-H1 alone (10.9%), suggesting the Advax adjuvant suppressed immunisation headaches though a currently unidentified mechanism.34 While adjuvants were ultimately not essential for immunogenicity of A/California/07/2009 vaccines, this was a rare exception as vaccines against high-pathogenicity avian influenza strains such as H5N1 or H7N9 have clearly shown adjuvants are needed for adequate seroprotection.",

In particular, wet-laboratory methods for study of new viruses require that the virus first be successfully cultured, and even then there is a risk that the virus will mutate in culture and not be fully representative of the wild-type viruses causing the pandemic. This was highlighted by the problems of the A/California/04/2009 reference sequence, with the rHA from this sequence having no agglutination activity. While this problem was ultimately solved by the more representative A/California/07/2009 strain, this caused time delays due to the problems with vaccine manufacture. As we show here, rapid analysis of new mutant influenza strains based in silico structural modeling can provide important early insights into key virus properties, including its ability to bind human and avian sialic acid receptors. In the future such in silico approaches are likely to become more routine in the analysis of new pandemic viruses.",

In fact, there was an extremely low 3.9% rate of late H1N1/2009pdm seroconversion between weeks 6 and 26, suggesting most of subjects were protected during the peak period of the pandemic when the pandemic virus was widely circulating in the community. It would also have been useful to do a direct comparison within the study between the immunogenicity of the Advax-adjuvanted recombinant hemagglutinin vaccine and a commercial inactivated virus vaccine, but this was not possible as at the time that the FLU005 study commenced, no pandemic vaccine based on inactivated virus was yet available. While it would be useful to have crystal structures of Pro200 and Ser200 HA bound to the human and avian sialic acid receptors to confirm the predictions of our in silico structural models, we have previously used a similar modeling approach to predict the structure and behavior of HA from the novel H7N9 influenza strain31 and were able to confirm the accuracy of the model against the published crystal structure.",

Every 3 plates, we included a standard antibody, corresponding to the test virus, to check if the assay has been done properly. The medium used for the dilutions was DMEM supplemented with 3% FBS and TPCK-trypsin. The working dilution of the virus had been determined by virus titration before use on MDCK cells. In all experiments, only fresh aliquots of virus were used. Firstly, 50\u00b5l of the serially diluted samples and 50\u00b5l of virus were mixed in 96-well plates and incubated 1 hour at 37\u00baC with 5% CO2. Half-logarithmic dilution steps were chosen to have a broad range of serum dilution. Standard antibodies with a mid-range titer were included as a positive control. Then 100\u00b5l of 1.5\u00d7105 MDCK cells were added to each well. Incubation was done overnight at 37\u00baC with 5% CO2. After removing media, plates were washed once with PBS then fixed with 100\u00b5l of fixative (50% MeOH/Aceton) per well for 10 minutes, and followed by an immunostaining step to detect the amount of Influenza viral nucleoprotein. Hundred \u00b5l per well of mouse anti-Influenza A virus nucleoprotein antibody (BEI, NR-4544), 1:5,000 dilution in 1% BSA/PBS was added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing, 100\u00b5l per well of detection biotin-anti-mouse IgG1 1:5,000 in 1% BSA/PBS antibody plus Streptavidin-HRP 1:2,000 were added and incubated for 1 hour. After washing, 50\u00b5l per well of DAB substrate was added and incubated for about 10 minutes to allow color development. Plates were washed thoroughly with tap water, dried inverted overnight and scanned and counted using ImmunoSpot\u00ae Image analyzer (version 5.0.41, Cellular Technology Ltd, Cleveland, OH) adapted to microneutralisation and virus titration. The microneutralisation gives results as end point titer which is expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum with infected cells number less than X. X is half of the difference between the average number of infected cells of positive control wells and the average number of infected cells of negative control wells. All wells with several infected cells below this X value are considered as positive for neutralisation. This absence of infectivity indicates the presence of virus-specific antibodies in the samples in enough amount to prevent the Influenza virus from infecting the cells. To decrease the variability of the results, we did the microneutralisation in duplicates for each sample. Replicate assays were combined as geometric means to give a single titer. For calculation, a negative MNT titer was assigned a value of 5, which was half of the minimum detectable; and titres greater than the final dilution were assigned a value of 1280, which was twice the maximum detectable.",
