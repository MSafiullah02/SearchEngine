One of the main tools of the policymakers is to control the contact rate among the population, commonly referred to as social distancing, in order to reduce the spread of the disease. We pose a mean-field game model of individuals each choosing a dynamic strategy of making contacts, given the trade-off of utility from contacts but also risk of infection from those contacts. We compute and compare the mean-field equilibrium (MFE) strategy, which assumes individuals acting selfishly to maximize their own utility, to the socially optimal strategy, which is the strategy maximizing the total utility of the population. We prove that the infected always want to make more contacts than the level at which it would be socially optimal, which reinforces the need to reduce contacts of the infected (e.g. quarantining, sick paid leave). Additionally, we compute the socially optimal strategies, given the costs to incentivize people to change from their selfish strategies. We find that if we impose limited resources, curbing contacts of the infected is more important after the peak of the epidemic has passed. Lastly, we compute the price of anarchy of this system, to understand the conditions under which large discrepancies between the MFE and socially optimal strategies arise, which is when public policy would be most effective. arXiv:2005.06758v1 [q-bio.PE]",

Previous work has explicitly included contact behaviors as control variables into the classical SIR model and have shown that different dynamics can emerge with adaptive behavior [1] [2] [3] . Disease dynamics has also been studied with game theory, focusing mostly on steady-state problems or those related to vaccination [4] [5] [6] . Optimal control theory is also often used to study policy interventions on infectious disease dynamics [7, 8] . Our work here builds on these previous models to pose a mean-field game problem of social distancing, explicitly modeling the feedback between the individuals and the population structure. The individual, which is susceptible (S), infected (I), or recovered (R), each chooses a dynamic contact strategy to maximize its accumulated utility over the time period.",

Depending on the number of contacts each individual makes, the dynamics of the population follow the SIR model, and the anticipated population structure influences the computation of an individual's optimal strategy.

The realistic conditions that we impose are the following. Starting from zero contacts, increasing the number of contacts results in increased utility, reflecting human need for social interactions as well as the economic gain of spending time at work.

We see that the spread of infection is mitigated by the behavioral changes by the susceptible population, compared to the classical case in which no adaptive behavior is considered. As we showed in Proposition 1 and 2, the recovered and infected population have no incentive to lower their contact rates, and so they continue at their maximum level of activities. The susceptible population lowers their contact rate to balance their immediate utilities and their expected cost of possibly getting infected. (Fig. 4a) . If the disease has longer recovery time (small \u00b5), the classical model predicts faster spread, but we see that the MFE solution does not always move in the same direction. For example, when \u00b5 = 0.02, it might be intuitive to predict that since \u00b5 is small, the population will get infected faster, but because we explicitly consider the decision of each individual in our model, we predict a very gradual epidemic, as it becomes optimal to further suppress contacts to avoid getting infected in the first place (Fig. 4b) . b I and a I are parameters which would not be included in the classical SIR model, but they will change the predicted epidemic curves. If a disease does not particularly affect the infected individual's productivity (high b I ), the disease will spread as if its transmission rate \u03b2 is higher (Fig. 4c) . The epidemic spread as predicted by the classical SIR model would not change with a I , but the MFE solution shows smaller epidemic and flatter growth rate for high a I , as individuals choose to make less contacts to avoid the high cost of becoming infected (Fig. 4d) .

First, we can pose the problem with different compartmental models. For example, if we take the SIS model, we would see different optimal strategies since the infected also face the burden of social distancing. In the case of COVID-19, it will be most useful to include a compartment with asymptomatic transmission, which behaves like S from the central planner's perspective. The socially optimal strategies depended on being able to distinguish the S and the I, when it is not always the case. The lack of available testing of COVID-19, for example, provides the uncertainty within the population as well as from the central planner's perspective. Second, we can add heterogeneity to the population by including state variables such as age, socioeconomic status, or level of prosociality. By explicitly adding the different subpopulations, we can understand the game theoretic dilemma at play between the old vs. the young, the financially stable vs. the unstable, or the prosocial vs. antisocial.

Even if only the susceptibles are practicing social distancing, it still decreases the number of contacts of the system, and so the infected population reaches a smaller peak (Fig. 3,  4) .

            "text": "If cost is imposed to the central planner in changing the contact rates of the individuals, we find the new socially optimal contact rates, depending on k, which is the per capita unit cost of changing contact rates. For k = 0 and k 1 respectively, we find the cost-imposed socially optimal solution to be the previously computed c opt and c eq . For k values in between (Fig. 7) , we commonly see that when it is too costly to decrease the infected contact rate for the whole time period, it is most beneficial to at least focus on decreasing after the epidemic has subsided. An assumption here is that cost of central planning is constant in time, when it may not be in real world situations. When outbreak is at its peak, more public attention is on the disease, and it may be easier to implement social distancing or secure funding for quarantining. However, when the disease has subsided, it might be harder to convince the public to behave differently. This result reinforces the need for formal social distancing policy which goes beyond the peak of the epidemic. When the disease is prevalent, social distancing can be naturally favored due to individual optimization, but to sustain it for longer requires centralized public policy to prevent second peaks. This general result is in agreement with other studies of COVID-19 policies which mention the likely possibility of second peaks [12] [13] [14] . Additional work, using more realistic central planning cost depending on time and population structure, will help us better understand how such long-term social distancing policies should be implemented.",
