Considering that Ang-(1-7) inhibits the growth of several cell lines [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , it has been suggested that the heptapeptide may also reduce the proliferation of cancer cells and tumors.",

Three lung cancer cell lines including human adenocarcinoma SK-LU-1 and A549 cells and non-small cell lung cancer SK-MES-1 cells were incubated with Ang- (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) to determine the effect of the heptapeptide on cell growth [12] . Ang-(1-7) potently inhibited the growth of all cell lines of lung cancer at subnanomolar concentrations [12] . The antiproliferative effect of Ang-(1-7) was associated with reduction in serum-stimulated phosphorylation of the MAP kinases ERK1/2 [12] . In addition, the inhibitory effect of Ang-(1-7) was mediated by Mas receptor, since it was blocked by the Mas receptor antagonist D-Ala7-Ang-(1-7) (A-779) and not affected by AT 1 or AT 2 [12] . In vivo evidence was obtained by the intravenous administration of Ang-(1-7) in mice with A549 human lung tumors [15] . Ang-(1-7) infusion was very well tolerated by the mice and resulted in a reduction of tumor volume by 30% compared to the size prior to treatment [15] . These findings were associated with a decrease in the proliferation marker Ki67 [15] .",

COX-2 is overexpressed in 70-90% of adenocarcinomas [16] . Clinical trials with nonselective inhibitors of COX-2 decreased the risk for lung cancer, suggesting that a reduction in COX-2 is associated with inhibition of lung tumor growth [17, 18] . Ang-(1-7) significantly reduced COX-2 mRNA and protein in both A549 tumor xenografts and A549 cells in culture [15] . It should be pointed that Ang-(1-7) has significant advantages over the administration of nonselective and selective COX-2 inhibitors for lung cancer since the heptapeptide-mediated reduction in COX-2 is associated with antithrombotic and antiinflammatory activities without the side effects related to COX-2 inhibitors [19] . In regard to antiangiogenic activity, athymic mice with A549 lung tumors were injected daily with 1000 \u03bcg/kg of Ang-(1-7) for 5 days, followed by a 2-day drug-free, and sacrificed after 42 days [20] . Ang-(1-7) markedly decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein and mRNA, vessel density and A549 lung tumor growth [20] . The antiangiogenic effect of Ang-(1-7) was also mediated by Mas receptor [20] .",

It was found that miRNA-149-3p plays a role in cellular migration processes [21] and miRNA-513a-3p controls the protein level and molecular function of integrin-\u03b28, thus reducing cell migration and inflammation [22] . Another recent line of investigation is the use viral vectors to deliver Ang-(1-7). Chen and coworkers [23] constructed a mutant adeno-associated viral vector AAV8 (Y733F) that produced stable and highly efficient Ang-(1-7) expression in a xenograft tumor model. AAV8-mediated Ang-(1-7) overexpression inhibited tumor growth in vivo by downregulating Cdc6 and antiangiogenesis. These findings provide useful information for future investigations on drug development.",

To investigate the mechanisms beyond antitumor effect of Ang-(1-7) in GBM, Liu and coworkers evaluated the crosstalk between Podocalyxin (PODX) and Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor signaling in GBM cells, and examined its effect on GBM cell invasion and proliferation [35] . It has been previously reported that PODX enhances invasion in many human cancers including GBM. The authors found a significant negative correlation between the expression of PODX and Mas in GBM tumor tissues from 10 patients (r = \u22120.768, p < 0.01) [35] . The stable overexpression of PODX in LN-229 and U-118 MG human GBM cells decreased the mRNA and protein expression of Mas receptor, resulting in low density of Ang-(1-7)-binding Mas on the cell membrane. Overexpression and knockdown of PODX respectively reversed and enhanced the inhibitory effects of Ang-(1-7) on the expression/activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and cell invasion and proliferation in GBM cells. PODX inhibited Ang-(1-7)/Mas signaling by downregulating the expression of Mas through a PI3K-dependent mechanism in GBM cells. This effect increased GBM cell invasion and proliferation [35] .",

These effects were mediated by Mas receptor since they were completely blocked by A-779 [39] . In addition, Ang-(1-7) significantly reduced the growth and the vessel density of human nasopharyngeal xenografts [39] . Mechanistic investigations revealed that, also in this tumor, Ang-(1-7) inhibited the expression of the proangiogenic factors VEGF and PlGF. The effects and signaling pathways involved in the Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis in NPC were further investigated both in vitro and in vivo [40] . Ang-(1-7) inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in NPC-TW01 cells. Ang-(1-7) induced autophagy by increasing the levels of the autophagy marker LC3-II and by enhancing p62 degradation via activation of the Beclin-1/Bcl-2 signaling pathway with participation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and p38 pathways [40] . Pretreatment with Ang-(1-7) also inhibited tumor growth in NPC xenografts by stimulating autophagy, while no autophagy was observed following Ang-(1-7) posttreatment [40] . To sum up, Ang-(1-7) plays a role in autophagy downstream signaling pathways in NPC, supporting its therapeutic potential for reducing the incidence of primary NPC tumors and for preventing recurrent disease [40] .",

Ang-(1-7) administration reduced circulating levels of plasma placental growth factor (PlGF) levels in patients with clinical improvement, but not in patients without clinical benefit [46] .

This study intends to investigate the effectiveness of TXA127 for the mitigation of severity and/or incidence of thrombocytopenia, as well as safety when administered as a self-injected, subcutaneous solution. TXA127 was administered to patients with breast cancer in the adjuvant setting to determine the effect of Ang-(1-7) on cytopenia [47] . No dose-limiting toxicities were reported, and Ang-(1-7) reduced thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia [47] . Patients with ovarian, Fallopian tube, or peritoneal carcinoma receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin or cisplatin were also treated with TXA127. Once more, Ang-(1-7) reduced thrombocytopenia following gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy [48] . These data suggest that Ang-(1-7) may be beneficial in attenuating multilineage cytopenias following bone marrow-toxic chemotherapy.",

The antitumor effect of Ang-(1-7) was due to reduction of angiogenesis, cancer-associated fibrosis, osteoclastogenesis, tumor-induced inflammation, and metastasis, as well as inhibition of cancer cell growth and proliferation. In clinical trials, Ang-(1-7) was well tolerated with limited toxic or quality-of-life side effects and showed clinical benefit in cancer patients with solid tumors. In conclusion, these findings so far suggest that Ang-(1-7) may act as chemotherapeutic agent, reducing cancer growth and metastases by pleiotropic mechanisms as well as targeting the tumor microenvironment. Further clinical trials are needed to confirm safety, and to determine doses and clinical indications.",
