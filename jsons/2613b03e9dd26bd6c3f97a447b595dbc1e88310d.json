Reoviruses infect respiratory and intestinal epithelium and disseminate systemically in newborn animals. Until now, a strategy to rescue infectious virus from cloned cDNA has not been available for any member of the Reoviridae family of dsRNA viruses. We report the generation of viable reovirus following plasmid transfection of murine L929 (L) cells using a strategy free of helper virus and independent of selection. We used the reovirus reverse genetics system to introduce mutations into viral capsid proteins s1 and s3 and to rescue a virus that expresses a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene, thus demonstrating the tractability of this technology. The plasmid-based reverse genetics approach described here can be exploited for studies of reovirus replication and pathogenesis and used to develop reovirus as a vaccine vector.",

Reovirus infection is initiated by viral attachment to host cells via the filamentous attachment protein s1 (Furlong et al., 1988) . The s1 protein engages cell-surface carbohydrate (Chappell et al., 1997 (Chappell et al., , 2000 and junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) ( Barton et al., 2001b; Campbell et al., 2005) , an integral component of intercellular tight junctions (Martin-Padura et al., 1998) . Following attachment to the cell surface, reovirus internalization is mediated by b1 integrins (Maginnis et al., 2006) , most likely via clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Ehrlich et al., 2004) . In the endocytic compartment, viral outer-capsid proteins s3 and m1/m1C are cleaved by acid-dependent cysteine proteases Ebert et al., 2002) , resulting in generation of infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs) (Borsa et al., 1981) . During ISVP formation, s3 is removed and a hydrophobic conformer of m1/m1C is exposed, facilitating endosomal membrane penetration and delivery of transcriptionally active reovirus core particles into the cytoplasm (Chandran et al., 2002; Odegard et al., 2004) , where the remainder of the replication cycle occurs.",

Despite extensive efforts in several laboratories, generation of an animal dsRNA virus entirely from cloned cDNAs has not been achieved. This critical technological gap is perhaps the single most important limitation to studies of these viruses. Previous efforts on reovirus and rotavirus reverse genetics have resulted in entirely RNA-based (Roner et al., 1997) or partially plasmid-based (Komoto et al., 2006) systems that permit replacement of one or two viral genes. These approaches have been used to rescue temperature-sensitive reovirus strains (Roner et al., 1997) , define packaging signals in reovirus RNAs (Roner and Steele, 2007) , and isolate rotaviruses containing engineered changes in the viral attachment protein (Komoto et al., 2006) . However, neither the reovirus nor rotavirus reverse genetics systems in their current configurations permit selective introduction and recovery of desired mutations in each viral gene segment.",

Neither helper virus nor coexpression of viral replication proteins is required for recovery of wild-type (WT) virus or engineered viral mutants.

We also recovered a recombinant virus that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) by replacement of the s3 open reading frame (ORF) with GFP. The establishment of plasmid-based reverse genetics for reovirus will allow heretofore technically unapproachable problems in dsRNA virus biology to be studied, provide a platform for development of analogous marker rescue systems for other segmented dsRNA viruses, and foster exploration of reovirus as a vaccine vector to elicit protective immunity against a variety of mucosal pathogens.",

As all reovirus (+)-sense RNAs are terminated with a 5 0 guanosine (Furuichi et al., 1975a (Furuichi et al., , 1975b , plasmid-generated transcripts are anticipated to possess native 5 0 ends (Roner and Joklik, 2001) (Figure 1A) . Murine L929 fibroblast (L) cells, which efficiently support reovirus replication (Barton et al., 2001a) , were infected with the attenuated, T7 RNA polymerase-expressing vaccinia virus strain rDIs-T7pol 1 hr prior to transfection with the ten reovirus cDNA plasmids ( Figure 1B ). Nascent transcripts were synthesized with the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme fused to the 3 0 terminus, which is expected to generate a native 3 0 end upon autocatalytic removal (Roner and Joklik, 2001 ) ( Figure 1A ). Thus, this (B) Schematic of approach. The ten reovirus cDNA constructs are transfected into murine L cells expressing T7 RNA polymerase from recombinant vaccinia virus strain rDIs-T7pol, which is replication defective. Nascent transcripts correspond to viral mRNAs containing the native 5 0 end. Self cleavage by the HDV ribozyme generates the native viral 3 0 end. Following 5 days of incubation, transfected cells are lysed by freeze-thaw, and viable viruses rescued from cloned cDNAs are isolated by plaque assay using L cells. (C) Kinetics of virus production following plasmid transfection of L cells. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA according to the protocol in (B) and lysed at the intervals shown. Viral titers in cell lysates were determined by plaque assay. (D) Infectious center assay following plasmid transfection of L cells. Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA, trypsinized at the intervals shown posttransfection, washed, counted, diluted, and applied directly to monolayers of untreated L cells. The number of the infectious centers was determined by plaque assay. expression strategy should yield ten unique reovirus mRNA species competent to complete all steps in the viral RNA life cycle. Accordingly, rescued viruses were recovered from cell-culture supernatants by plaque assay on L cell monolayers ( Figure 1C ).",

At 24-48 hr posttransfection, times corresponding to the primary round of infection, eight or fewer infectious centers per 10 6 cells were detected ( Figure 1D ). The number of infectious centers increased substantially between 48 and 72 hr posttransfection to 18 to 90 per 10 6 cells, suggesting that a secondary round of infection had ensued by the 72 hr time point. Viral titer in transfection lysates was below the limit of detection ($10 PFU/ml) at 24 hr but was detectable at 48 hr and increased logarithmically at time points thereafter ( Figure 1C ). The ratio of viral PFU in transfection lysates to infectious centers was $10 to 100 at 48 and 72 hr. These results indicate that initiation of productive reovirus replication from transfected plasmids is inefficient, with approximately 1 cell per 10 5 to 10 6 cells giving rise to, on average, 10 to 100 viable virus particles that establish infection of the culture. In our experiments, yields of WT virus 5 days after plasmid transfection are regularly in the range of 10 4 -10 6 PFU/ml ( Figure 1C ).",

To confirm that viruses isolated using the plasmid-based rescue procedure contained the expected combination of gene segments, genomic dsRNA isolated from recombinant strain (rs) T3D and rsT3D/T1LS1 was resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining ( Figure 2A ). The electropherotype of rsT3D was indistinguishable from that of strain T3D, the origin of the cloned cDNA sequences used to generate rsT3D. Likewise, rsT3D/T1LS1 displayed an electropherotype consistent with nine cloned gene segments derived from T3D and a single cloned gene segment, S1, derived from strain T1L. To exclude the possibility of contamination, a silent point mutation, G to A at nucleotide 2205, was introduced into the L1 gene of all virus strains generated from cloned cDNAs ( Figure 2B ). This change has not been observed in any reported T3D L1 sequence (Wiener and Joklik, 1989 ) and serves as a signature for viruses derived through plasmid-based rescue. As anticipated, sequence analysis of rsT3D and rsT3D/ T1LS1 revealed the expected G to A substitution (Figure 2C) , confirming the plasmid origins of these isolates.",

Purified virions of rsT3D and rsT3D-s1T249I were treated with trypsin and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As expected, a digestion pattern consistent with formation of ISVPs (loss of s3 protein and generation of the d fragment of m1C protein) was observed for both viruses ( Figure 4B ). However, the stability of rsT3D and rsT3D-s1T249I s1 proteins differed. The band corresponding to rsT3D s1 diminished in intensity immediately after trypsin addition until it was eventually undetectable ( Figure 4B ). However, the rsT3D-s1T249I s1 band was intact even after 60 min of digestion. Thus, the T249I polymorphism is an independent determinant of s1 cleavage susceptibility.",

In contrast, titers of rsT3D-s1T249I remained relatively stable throughout the assay time course. Loss of infectivity of rsT3D correlated with kinetics of s1 cleavage (compare Figures 4B and 4C ), indicating that changes in viral infectivity after trypsin treatment are governed by the cleavage state of s1.

Exposure of T3D to an intestinal wash results in s1 cleavage (Chappell et al., 1998) , raising the possibility that failure of T3D to infect the intestine is in part attributable to s1 cleavage susceptibility. To test whether susceptibility of s1 to proteolytic cleavage is associated with diminished T3D growth in animals, we assessed the capacity of rsT3D and rsT3D-s1T249I to infect the intestine and disseminate systemically following PO inoculation ( Figure 5A ). Newborn mice were inoculated perorally with each strain, and viral titers in the intestine and brain were determined at 4, 8, and 12 days after inoculation. At all time points tested, titers of rsT3D-s1T249I in the intestine were greater than those produced by rsT3D. Furthermore, rsT3D-s1T249I produced greater titers in the brain at days 8 and 12 than did rsT3D. However, when inoculated by the intracranial (IC) route, rsT3D and rsT3D-s1T249I produced equivalent titers ( Figure 5B ), although rsT3D reached peak titers at earlier time points than did rsT3D-s1T249I. These findings indicate that a Thr-Ile polymorphism at amino acid 249 in T3D s1 controls viral growth in the murine intestine and systemic spread to the CNS. (Chappell et al., 2002) . The three monomers in the crystallized fragment are shown in red, yellow, and blue; the model is shown in gray. The inset shows an enlarged view of the b spiral region in s1 that influences susceptibility of the molecule to cleavage by intestinal proteases (Chappell et al., 1998) . Side chains of Arg245 and Thr249 are depicted in ball-and-stick representation. (B) Electrophoretic analysis of viral structural proteins of rsT3D and rsT3D-s1T249I during treatment with trypsin to generate ISVPs. Purified 35 S-methionine-labeled virions were treated with trypsin for the indicated intervals and loaded into wells of a 4%-20% polyacrylamide gradient gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was prepared for fluorography and exposed to film. Samples of untreated virions appear in the lanes labeled ''V.'' Viral proteins are labeled. Positions of molecular weight standards (in kDa) are indicated. The experiments shown are representative of two performed for each virus.

However, reverse genetics technology permits testing of tightly focused, rational hypotheses about complex questions of virus structure, virus-cell interactions, and viral pathogenesis through direct engineering of the viral genome without a need to devise complicated selection strategies for isolation of viral mutants. Furthermore, reverse genetics of RNA viruses has supported rapid generation of vaccines against these and other infectious agents and propelled their use as gene delivery vehicles (Blaney et al., 2006; Horimoto and Kawaoka, 2006; Riezebos-Brilman et al., 2006) .",

Thus, this new technology provides (Olland et al., 2001) , in which cathepsin L cleavage sites are depicted in blue between amino acids 243 and 244 and between 250 and 251 . Surrounding residues, from amino acids 241 to 253, are shown in yellow. The C-terminal residues of s3, from amino acids 340-365, are colored red. Tyr354, which is altered in several PI , D-EA (Ebert et al., 2001) , and ACA-D viruses (Clark et al., 2006) , is shown in green. The viriondistal end of s3 is at the top of the figure, and the virion-proximal end and N terminus are at the bottom. The inset shows an enlarged view of the boxed region of s3 using the same color scheme. Side chains of amino acids 243, 244, 250, 251, and 354 are depicted in ball-and-stick representation. (B) Chymotrypsin treatment of rsT3D and rsT3D-s3Y354H. Purified virions were treated with chymotrypsin for the indicated intervals and loaded into wells of 10% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie blue. Viral proteins are labeled. The experiments shown are representative of two performed for each virus. (C) Growth of rsT3D and rsT3D-s3Y354H in L cells treated with E64. L cells were preincubated in medium with or without E64 at the concentrations shown. The medium was removed, cells were adsorbed with virus for 1 hr, and fresh medium with or without E64 was added. After 24 hr incubation, viral titers in cell lysates were determined by plaque assay. The results are presented as the mean viral yields, calculated by dividing titer at 24 hr by titer at 0 hr for each concentration of E64, for triplicate experiments. Error bars indicate SD. (B) RT-PCR analysis of rsT3D and rsT3D/S4-GFP. Viral dsRNA was extracted from purified virions and subjected to RT-PCR using primers specific for T3D S4 and GFP sequences. Numbers delineate the S4 RNA nucleotide position corresponding to the 5 0 end of S4-specific primers. (C) Viral protein expression in cells infected with rsT3D/S4-GFP. L cells were infected with rsT3D or rsT3D/S4-GFP at an MOI of 1 PFU per cell and incubated for 24 hr. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies specific for mNS, sNS, and s3 proteins. (D) Image analysis of cells infected with rsT3D/S4-GFP. L cells were infected with rsT3D/S4-GFP, stained with antibodies specific for mNS (blue) and s3 (red) proteins at 24 hr postinfection, and imaged by confocal laser scanning microscopy.

This difference in infectivity is hypothesized to be a direct result of s1 cleavage (Nibert et al., 1995; Chappell et al., 1998) , presumably due to removal of the JAM-A-binding region of the molecule. Although the T249I substitution in expressed T3D s1 renders it resistant to cleavage by trypsin (Chappell et al., 1998) , until now it has not been possible to define the role of s1 cleavage in T3D infectivity for lack of means to generate a mutant T3D virus with the T249I change. This virus has been generated using reverse genetics, and our findings indicate that cleavage susceptibility of viral attachment protein s1 due to a single polymorphism at amino acid position 249 is the basis for reduced infectivity of T3D ISVPs relative to virions ( Figure 4C ) and contributes to diminished growth of T3D in the murine intestine following PO inoculation ( Figure 5A ).",

A C-terminal Y354H mutation in s3 protein of strain T3D was selected during persistent infection of L cells (PI viruses) and by serial passage of virus in L cells treated with either E64 (D-EA viruses) (Ebert et al., 2001) or ammonium chloride (ACA-D viruses) (Clark et al., 2006) . Using reovirus reverse genetics, the Y354H substitution was introduced into a WT T3D genetic background, and the resultant virus, rsT3D-s3Y354H, demonstrated accelerated kinetics of s3 cleavage ( Figure 6B ) and diminished sensitivity to the growth-inhibitory effects of E64 ( Figure 6C ). Residue 354 is located in a position thought to be important for controlling access to protease-hypersensitive regions in s3, residues 208-214 and 238-242, thereby influencing s3 cleavage kinetics (Jan\u00e9 -Valbuena et al., 2002) . Therefore, it appears that residue 354 in s3 is a gatekeeper for the viral outer capsid, serving to regulate the balance between viral stability and an irreversible, proteolytically triggered disassembly cascade committing the virion particle to either replication or inactivation.",

These results reveal the potential for exploitation of reovirus as a gene-transduction vector with application in the development of new mucosal vaccines, more effective oncolytic agents (Coffey et al., 1998) , and high-level expression of foreign genes in animal cells. Ideal reovirus vectors will contain stable s1 proteins and combine excellent extracellular stability with highly efficient intracellular disassembly. We find that each of these parameters can be independently adjusted through strategic alterations in outercapsid proteins. Manipulation of inner-capsid proteins and the genomic RNA itself should allow construction of viruses able to circumvent other aspects of virus-cell and virus-host interactions that pose potential barriers to antigen and gene delivery by reovirus.",

Thus, the reovirus plasmid-based marker rescue system is suited to the isolation of viable viral clones by plaque assay, followed by expansion in cell culture to attain quantities of virus sufficient for phenotypic analyses. Manipulations that severely cripple viral replication or particle assembly are more challenging to study because these changes may prohibit virus isolation. However, recovery of a GFP-expressing virus, rsT3D/S4-GFP, demonstrates that marker rescue of lethal mutations is possible by transcomplementation (in this case with WT s3 protein) (Figure 7 and Figure S1 ). This result also agrees with our previous finding that inhibition of reovirus replication by RNAi-mediated reduction of viral protein synthesis is reversible by transcomplementation with ectopically expressed WT protein (Kobayashi et al., 2006) . Furthermore, transcomplementation allows precise definition through systematic mutational analysis of functional domains in reovirus proteins that are essential for viral replication (Kobayashi et al., 2006) . It should be possible to apply this technique to the new marker rescue system for delineation of structure-function relationships in reovirus proteins and RNA.",

To generate pT7-L1T3D, pT7-L2T3D, pT7-L3T3D, pT7-M1T3D, pT7-M2T3D, pT7-M3T3D, pT7-S2T3D, pT7-S3T3D, and pT7-S4T3D, viral cDNA-containing fragments were subcloned into p3E5EGFP (Watanabe et al., 2004) . Viral cDNAs fused at their native 5 0 termini to the phage T7 RNA polymerase promoter were inserted into p3E5EGFP by partial or complete replacement of plasmid sequences encoding GFP and the Ebola virus leader and trailer, resulting in ligation of native 3 0 termini to the HDV ribozyme sequence. To generate pBacT7-S1T3D and pBacT7-S1T1L, encoding the T3D S1 and T1L S1 genes, respectively, S1 cDNAs fused to the T7 promoter and a portion of the HDV ribozyme were first cloned into the BseRI site of p3E5EGFP, and fragments containing the S1 gene flanked 5 0 by the T7 promoter and 3 0 by the HDV ribozyme and T7 terminator sequences were subcloned into the XbaI site of pBacPAK8 (Clontech). pBacT7-S1T3D and pT7-S4T3D were used as templates to generate mutant constructs pBacT7-S1T3DT249I and pT7-S4T3DY354H, respectively, by introduction of specific nucleotide substitutions using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) (Table S4 ). To generate pT7-S4GFP, S4 nucleotide sequences 150-768 within pT7-S4T3D were replaced with the GFP ORF. Nucleotide sequences of recombinant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
