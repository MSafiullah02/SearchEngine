            "text": "Asthma is a highly prevalent chronic respiratory disease affecting 300 million people worldwide. A significant fraction of the cost and morbidity of asthma derives from acute care for asthma exacerbations. In the United States alone, there are approximately 15 million outpatient visits, 2 million emergency room visits, and 500 000 hospitalizations each year for management of acute asthma. Common respiratory viruses, especially rhinoviruses, cause the majority of exacerbations in children and adults. Infection of airway epithelial cells with rhinovirus causes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as recruitment of inflammatory cells, particularly neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. The host response to viral infection is likely to influence susceptibility to asthma exacerbation. Having had at least one exacerbation is an important risk factor for recurrent exacerbations suggesting an 'exacerbation-prone' subset of asthmatics. Factors underlying the 'exacerbation-prone' phenotype are incompletely understood but include extrinsic factors: cigarette smoking, medication non-compliance, psychosocial factors, and comorbidities such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, rhinosinusitis, obesity, and intolerance to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications; as well as intrinsic factors such as deficient epithelial cell production of the anti-viral type I interferons (IFN-a and IFN-b). A better understanding of the biologic mechanisms of host susceptibility to recurrent exacerbations will be important for developing more effective preventions and treatments aimed at reducing the significant cost and morbidity associated with this important global health problem.",

The highest prevalence rates have been reported in the United Kingdom (415%) and New Zealand (15.1%) [2] . In 2004, asthma exacerbations resulted in 14.7 million outpatient visits, 1.8 million emergency room visits, 497 000 hospitalizations and 4055 deaths in the United States alone [3] . Case-fatality from asthma in the United States is estimated at 5.2 per 100 000, with wide variations across Europe (e.g. 1.6 per 100 000 in Finland and 9.3 per 100 000 in Denmark) [2] . While only 20% of asthmatics have had exacerbations requiring treatment in the emergency department or hospitalization, these patients account for more than 80% of total direct costs [4] . This is in large part because the average cost of a hospital admission for asthma treatment in the United States in 2010 was US$9000 [5] .",

These episodes are distressing to patients and result in considerable utilization of health care resources and loss of work productivity and school attendance. Most exacerbations are managed in the outpatient setting. In the United States in 2004 there were 14.7 million visits to physician offices and hospital outpatient departments for acute asthma, but that still left 1.4 million patients who required emergency room management of their asthma exacerbation.",

Among these, there were 2770 intubations for respiratory failure associated with acute severe asthma (Table 1) . Further data from the NIS demonstrates that all age groups experienced hospitalization at similar rates, with a slight predominance of the 35-54-year age range, representing 31.7% of admissions for asthma. However, the NIS shows that mortality increases dramatically with increasing age. Children and adolescents have the lowest mortality rate (0.02%) and the elderly have the highest mortality from asthma (1.9% for ages475). Notably, among the approximately 4210 asthmatic patients who die from acute asthma annually in the United States, the majority (approximately 2/3) still occurs outside the hospital [8] .",

However, asthma prevalence is higher in post-pubertal females than postpubertal males and this fact is a large part of the explanation for the higher numbers of adult females seeking care for acute asthma [9, 10] . The higher prevalence of asthma in adult females contrasts with the higher prevalence of asthma in male children [11] . This difference in gender predisposition for asthma in adulthood vs. childhood likely reflects the complicated effects of sex hormones in asthma pathogenesis. Evidence for a role of estrogen in asthma comes from observations of increased asthma exacerbations during menses [12] , a higher incidence of adult-onset asthma in women taking hormone replacement therapy [13] , and from animal models [14] .",

While respiratory viruses cause most exacerbations, there are several different viruses that can cause exacerbation (including rhinovirus, influenza, and coronavirus), each with different seasonal variation. For example, exacerbations precipitated by rhinovirus can be documented throughout the year, with a predilection for late spring (April-May) and fall months (September-November) [21] . Interestingly, hospital mortality from asthma is highest in the winter months (January-March) perhaps related to higher rates of influenza infection [22] . Longitudinal adult prospective studies demonstrate a relationship between obesity and asthma, although this relationship may be confounded, in part by age, gender, and co-morbidities such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and sleep-disordered breathing [23] . Data from longitudinal studies suggest that there may also be a link between obesity and risk of asthma exacerbations, including exacerbations severe enough to warrant treatment in the emergency department or in the hospital [24] . The mechanisms by which obesity could be a risk factor for asthma exacerbation are not known, but it is interesting that obesity is associated with the production of proinflammatory factors and chemokines both in animal models and humans. These factors include eotaxin, an eosinophil chemoattractant, that is increased in the sputum during acute asthma [25, 26] as well as leptin, IL-6, and TNF-a [27] . However, there does not seem to be a relationship between BMI and sputum eosinophil counts suggesting that alternative inflammatory mechanisms may be contributing in obese asthmatics [28] .",

Factors such as non-white race, Medicaid insurance, other public or no insurance, and markers of asthma severity predicted risk of frequent visits. These data suggest that patients presenting with recurrent exacerbations are prone because of risks that relate to social factors, poor access to care, and inadequate chronic asthma control.

In a 1.5-year, prospective analysis of 2780 adult patients, those with a history of recent severe exacerbation requiring an emergency room visit or hospitalization in the past 3 months were at significantly increased risk of having recurrent, future exacerbations (odds ratio 6.33, 95% confidence interval 4.57-8.76) [24] .

Notably, a significant percentage of asthmatics had multiple exacerbations requiring three or more bursts of oral corticosteroids per year ranging across all levels of severity: mild (5%), moderate (13%), and severe (54%). Near fatal events were also not infrequent among these groups: mild (4%), moderate (6%), and severe (23%). In addition, case-control studies demonstrate that asthmatics with multiple exacerbations compared with those with single exacerbations are at increased risk for severe exacerbation, defined as initiation or escalation of systemic corticosteroids, despite more intensive maintenance anti-inflammatory treatment [31] . Characteristic features of the exacerbation-prone subjects include irreversible airflow limitation, chronic sinusitis, psychological dysfunction, and intolerance to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications [31, 32] .",

The European Network for Understanding Mechanisms of Severe Asthma characterized subjects with severe asthma and found that the subgroup with prior near-fatal asthma (NFA) differed from asthmatics of all severity groups with respect to reduced compliance with prescribed asthma medications and less corticosteroid use [33] . Interestingly, the NFA group was more similar to mild-to-moderate, rather than severe, asthmatics with regard to clinical and inflammatory parameters. Other studies have confirmed that asthmatics who suffer near fatal exacerbations are not distinguished by lung function, AHR, duration of asthma, gender, smoking status, ethnicity, and prevalence of atopy, but are distinguished by medication non-compliance, poor asthma control, and less corticosteroid use [34] [35] [36] . Asthmatics who experience near fatal exacerbations are an important subgroup of asthma, because better interventions for education, compliance, and use of inhaled corticosteroids might reduce the incidence of recurrent near fatal events. In addition, there is an association between admission to an intensive care unit and skin test sensitivity to fungal allergens, including Alternaria and Cladosporium [37] . The results of this cross-sectional study need to be replicated in further studies, but it is possible that environmental intervention to reduce exposure to moulds could help reduce the frequency of asthma exacerbations in certain asthmatics.",

            "text": "Asthma is associated with accelerated loss of lung function, although it is likely that a subgroup of asthmatics drives this association [38, 39] , and a minority of asthmatics (27% in one cohort study of difficult-to-control asthmatics [40] ) develops some degree of irreversible airflow obstruction. This subgroup of asthmatic patients with chronic airflow obstruction is at increased risk for acute asthma exacerbation, because reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) has been shown to be an important risk factor for multiple asthma exacerbations requiring either hospital care or systemic corticosteroids [31, 41] . The relationship between FEV 1 and risk of asthma exacerbation could be because exacerbations cause or promote long-term reductions in lung function or alternatively, the relationship may be a result of specific types of airway inflammation or specific host factors, such as smoking, that increase the risk of both exacerbation and lung function decline. A recent retrospective cohort study provided evidence in favour of exacerbation as an independent risk for accelerated loss of lung function. Specifically, the effect of severe exacerbations, defined by hospitalization or a decrease in FEV 1 X20% and X500 mL, on the progression of airway obstruction was evaluated in 93 non-smoking asthmatics with moderateto-severe disease before treatment with inhaled corticosteroids [42] . Those asthmatics who experienced at least one severe exacerbation had accelerated loss of lung function compared with those who did not have any exacerbations. The relationship between exacerbations and accelerated loss of lung function was independent of airflow obstruction at baseline. Indeed, one severe exacerbation per year was associated with a 30.2 mL greater annual decline in FEV 1 and more severe airflow obstruction after 11 years of follow-up. A possible explanation is that the multiple inflammatory pathways activated during acute exacerbation, including elevation of matrix metalloproteinases [43] , may have long-term consequences for airway remodelling [44] that result in airway narrowing. In this way asthma exacerbation may become selfperpetuating with one exacerbation causing changes in lung function that promote a subsequent exacerbation. This cycle may help explain the 'exacerbation-prone' phenotype ( Fig. 1) .",

The abnormality resolved completely within 24 h of treatment with mechanical ventilation, corticosteroids, and bronchodilators. Reproduced, with permission, from Fahy [102] . exacerbation in both children and adults [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . With the development of PCR techniques for viral detection, multiple community-based studies have consistently shown this. For example, in a study of children experiencing asthma exacerbations with decreased peak flow rates, viruses were detected in airway secretions in 80% to 85% of the cases, with rhinoviruses being the most commonly detected virus [54] . Other studies report rates of viral infection in acute asthma of between 55% and 78%, and rhinoviruses and coronaviruses are the most common culprits [52, 53] . Other viral causes include influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae [49, 53, 55, 56] . Newer virus detections methods such as DNA microarray-based viral detection methods show that multiple serotypes of rhinoviruses are detectable in airway secretions during respiratory infection in asthmatics [57] .",

For example, there appears to be a synergistic interaction between exposure to high levels of allergen and viral infection in causing a severe deterioration of asthma. For example, a case-control study of 60 adult patients compared those hospitalized with acute asthma to two control groups -patients with stable asthma and patients hospitalized for non-asthma conditions [55] . Compared with controls, a significantly higher proportion of acute asthmatics were both sensitized and exposed to allergens, including dust mite, cat, and dog allergen (66% vs. 37% and 15%, respectively). Most interestingly, the combination of sensitization, high exposure to one or more allergens, and viral detection significantly increased the risk of hospitalization for asthma compared with controls with stable asthma.",

Subjects challenged with allergen before and after intranasal inoculation of rhinovirus had increases in the latephase allergen responses to histamine and ragweed during their colds [58, 59] . These findings are corroborated by studies using segmental airway challenge before, during, and after infection with rhinovirus. Allergic rhinitis subjects infected with rhinovirus, and then challenged with allergen during their colds had greater histamine release (both during and 48 h after allergen challenge), as well as greater recruitment of eosinophils to the airway 48 h afterwards [60] . These effects persisted up to 1 month following the infection and were not observed in nonatopic subjects. Viral infection is likely to cause inflammation that primes the airway for enhanced responses to allergen exposure. It is likely that viral and allergic mechanisms act cooperatively to create an acute, severe asthmatic response.",

            "text": "Most of our understanding of the role of viruses in acute asthma is from studying the biology of rhinovirus infection, as this is the predominant virus causing exacerbations. Rhinovirus affects both the upper and lower airways, and primarily infects the epithelial cells lining the airway in close contact with the environment [61] . Infection of airway epithelial cells produces a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10), regulated on activation normal T cell expressed (RANTES), granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and eotaxin (Fig. 4) [62] [63] [64] . These cytokines and chemokines recruit inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils to the airway. Neutrophils are the predominant inflammatory cell detected in airway secretions during acute exacerbation [65] [66] [67] . Subjects who report having a respiratory tract infection as the trigger for their exacerbation have significantly higher percentages of neutrophils in their sputum [65] . This is probably caused by increases in epithelial IL-8 production, which is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils. Although corticosteroids can reduce epithelial cell expression of several chemokines, such as RANTES and IL-8, they may not be effective at inhibiting the other virus-induced pathways of inflammation, and their effectiveness at preventing virus-induced exacerbation remains controversial [68] .",

Rhinovirus infection stimulates the production of T-helper type 1 (Th1) cytokines, including IFN-g and IL-12, by peripheral blood mononuclear cells [72] . IFN-g has similar anti-viral activities as IFN-a and IFN-b. These include up-regulation of class I MHC, inhibition of viral replication, and the induction of several IFNsensitive genes [73] . Clinical studies show that decreased generation of IFN-g is associated with more severe colds and increased severity of acute asthma [74, 75] . The Th1 cytokines induced by rhinovirus infection during acute asthma differ from the production of Th2 cytokines more typical of chronic asthma (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) [72] . The balance of Th1 and Th2 cytokines may be an important determinant of the severity of exacerbation. For example, during experimental infection of asthmatic subjects with rhinovirus, the ratio of sputum IFN-g (Th1) to IL-4 (Th2) correlated inversely with peak cold symptoms and time to virus clearance [75] . This suggests that generation of robust Th1 responses may be important for limiting the effect of viral airway infection and that failure to generate such responses may increase the risk of virus-associated asthma exacerbations (Fig. 4) .",

Among patients hospitalized with acute asthma, those infected with rhinovirus are more likely to be current smokers [21] , and there is a high prevalence of current smoking (35%) in adults presenting with acute asthma to emergency departments [76] . In addition, smoking was found to be the most powerful independent modifiable risk factor for multiple exacerbations requiring hospital care in a prospective HMO-based study [41] . Another important modifiable risk factor in this study was exposure and allergic sensitivity to cat or dog, further underscoring the interaction between allergic and viral causes. Cigarette smoke has several effects on the airway that could promote asthma exacerbations. For example, cigarette smoking is associated with airway neutrophilia [77] and with changes in airway epithelial mucin stores that could affect viral clearance from the airway [78] (Fig. 4) . Other important extrinsic susceptibility factors include co-morbidities such as chronic rhinosinusitis, history of pneumonia, obesity, and GERD, and intolerance to NSAIDs [24, 31, 79] . Psychosocial factors such as depression, poor social support, public insurance, and unemployment play an important role as well [29, 80] .",

            "text": "Recently, exciting advances have been made in our understanding of susceptibility factors that are intrinsic to the asthmatic airway and that could promote exacerbations in a subset of asthmatics. Specifically, experimental models which infect primary bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic and healthy subjects with rhinovirus have shown that epithelial cells from healthy subjects are quite resistant to infection but that cells from asthmatics have enhanced viral replication and cell lysis [81] . In addition, apoptosis, rather than direct lysis, of an infected cell was important for controlling viral production and release of inflammatory mediators, and early induction of apoptosis was dramatically impaired in asthmatic vs. healthy cells [81] . Furthermore, asthmatic cells were deficient in the production of IFN-b, an early important anti-viral cytokine, and exogenous IFN-b restored the apoptosis defect in asthmatic cells and inhibited viral replication, suggesting that anti-viral pathways are intact in asthmatic cells but there is a deficiency in activating key anti-viral cytokines (Fig. 4) . Similar results were also discovered for IFN-l, a novel type III IFN with similar anti-viral properties [82] . This deficiency was observed whether or not asthmatics were taking inhaled corticosteroids. These defects in asthmatic epithelial cells also extended to macrophages from asthmatics, which were also deficient in IFN production. These data are important because a deficient anti-viral response to rhinovirus infection could enhance viral replication, cell damage, and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in exacerbation of asthma. At this time the mechanism of this suboptimal anti-viral response is poorly understood and specific interventions to remedy it are not available.",

Corticosteroids have been shown to enhance innate immunity and epithelial host defense while reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production, which may explain their role in reducing asthma exacerbation [68] . Furthermore, rhinovirus infection of epithelial cells leads to up-regulation of its own viral receptor, ICAM-1, whereas, corticosteroids can inhibit the induction of ICAM-1 by rhinovirus [87] . Corticosteroids also reduce AHR, a strategy that might lead to better control of exacerbations [88] . Despite their clear benefits, asthmatics at risk for exacerbation are generally under-treated with inhaled corticosteroids. An emphasis on asthma exacerbations as a specific outcome in asthma therapy in the recent guidelines of the NIH/NHLBI National Asthma Education and Prevention Program should help to educate providers about the need for corticosteroid use in patients with fewer daily symptoms, but recurrent exacerbations [6] . Recognizing that exacerbations occur even in some asthmatics using chronic systemic corticosteroids highlights the need to continue working towards more effective, mechanism-targeted therapies.",

            "text": "Asthma is a highly prevalent global health problem with significant morbidity and mortality. Cost is largely driven by acute care visits for the disease including clinic, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations. A minority of asthmatics, approximately 20%, is responsible for the majority of health care costs associated with exacerbations. A subset of asthmatics is 'exacerbation-prone' and the clinical characteristics of this subgroup include a history of cigarette smoking, psychosocial factors, medication non-compliance, and co-morbidities such as rhinosinusitis, obesity, GERD, and NSAID intolerance. Intrinsic host factors for this asthma subgroup are beginning to be identified, such as deficient epithelial cell production of anti-viral type I IFNs. Mechanistic studies in humans focusing on the 'exacerbation-prone' asthmatic will be important for better understanding how we can develop new preventions and treatments aimed at reducing the significant cost and morbidity associated with asthma.",
