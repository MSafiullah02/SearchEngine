            "text": "Prohibitin 2 (PHB2), also designated as B-cell receptor-associated protein 37 (BAP 37) and repressor of estrogen receptor activity (REA), is an ubiquitous, abundant and evolutionarily highly conserved protein with homologues in bacteria, yeast, Drosophila and mammals [1]. In yeasts, it has been well defined that PHB2, in a complex with highly homologous prohibitin 1 (PHB1), is localized in mitochondria and plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial inheritance and morphology [2]. PHB2 is involved in mitochondria-related cell processes like life span, cell growth, and apoptosis [3], [4]. In mammals, in addition to its mitochondrial functions, PHB2 has been found in multiple cellular compartments and possess diverse functions ranging from acting as scaffolding proteins at the plasma membrane to transcriptional regulators in the nucleus. PHB2 has been found at the plasma membrane of B lymphocytes in association with the IgM receptor [5]. PHB2 was shown to repress the transcriptional activity of various transcription factors, including steroid hormone receptors, either directly or through interactions with chromatin remodeling proteins [6], [7], [8], [9]. Interestingly, nuclear PHB2 was shown to protect sister-chromatid cohesion during mitosis [10]. In our previous work, we showed that PHB2, as a transcriptional repressor, interacts with both MyoD and myocyte enhancer factor2 (MEF2) and represses both MyoD- and MEF2-dependent gene transcription [6]. MyoD and MEF2 transcription factors are well-defined, critical factors in myogenesis [11]. Myoblast differentiation is regulated by cooperative interactions of myogeneic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (e.g. MyoD) with MEF2 and by signaling pathways that regulate MyoD and MEF2 activity [11], [12]. When stably expressed in C2C12 myogenic cells, PHB2 inhibits myogenic induction and phenotypic muscle differentiation [6]. Furthermore, PHB2 was found to mediate transcriptional repression by recruiting histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC5 [6], [13]. However, the molecular mechanisms of regulating PHB2 function remained largely elusive.",

Evidence has emerged that suggests PHBs can be regulated by phosphorylation. Indeed, several studies have noted the presence of multiple potential serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation sites in PHB2. Ross et al. have identified PHB2 as a serine and tyrosine phosphorylated protein using orthophosphate labeling coupled with phosphoamino acid analysis [14]. They mapped the tyrosine phosphorylation site of PHB2 to Tyr248 through mass spectrometry. However, the serine/threonine phosphorylation of these sites of PHB2 in vitro and in vivo and their upstream kinases has not been validated. Akt, as a serine/threonine kinase, was shown to bind to PHB2 directly in our previous study. Although PHB2 contains a consensus Akt phosphorylation site (86-RPRKIS-91), we failed to prove that Akt could phosphorylate PHB2 [6]. The consensus Akt phosphorylation site in PHB2 also fits the expected consensus calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs) phosphorylation sites (RXXS/T). Therefore, it is possible that CaMKIV could phosphorylate PHB2 at this consensus site.",

This truncated PHB2 which has similar domain region found to interact with Akt in a yeast two-hybrid screening with the full-length Akt as bait [6], interacts specifically with CaMK IV but does not with the empty vector pGBKT7 (Fig. 1A left). As expected, the Akt, as positive control was also found to directly interact with PHB2 in yeast. To map the minimal region of PHB2 that interacts with CaMK IV, GAL4-AD constructs containing various regions of truncated PHB2 were generated and tested for their ability to interact with CaMK IV in yeast. As shown in Fig. 1B, the C-terminus of region of PHB2 (amino acid 120 to 299), but not the N-terminal region of PHB2 (amino acid 57\u2013120), interacted with CaMK IV.

Consistent with the capacity of CaMK IV to phosphorylate PHB2 at this site, we demonstrated that a PHB2 S91A mutant is refractory to CaMK IV-directed phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, lane 3), suggesting that PHB2 serine 91 serves as the major phosphorylation site for CaMK IV.",

To this end, we employed a MEF2 activity-dependent reporter assay in which the expression of the reporter gene luciferase is controlled by three MEF2 DNA binding elements (3 \u00d7 MEF2-luc). C2C12 cells were transfected with 3 \u00d7 MEF2-luc along with constructs for wild type PHB2 (Xp-PHB2) or phosphorylation-defective PHB2 (Xp-PHB2mut) in combination with or without constitutively active CaMK IV (CaMKIVca). As shown in Fig. 4A, both Xp-PHB2 and Xp-PHB2-mut significantly reduced MEF2-dependent luciferase activity. Since active CaMK IV strongly activates the MEF2 transactivation activity as previously reported [17], we found that the reduction of MEF2 activity by PHB2 was reversed by active CaMK IV, but Xp-PHB2-mut-mediated repression could not be effectively relieved by active CaMK IV (Fig. 4B). This finding suggests that the phosphorylation of PHB2 by active CaMK IV de-represses the transcriptional inhibitory effect of PHB2 on MEF2 activity, which could be one of the mechanisms underlying CaMK-mediated activation of MEF2.",

Its amino terminus containing hydrophobic stretches anchors PHB2 to the membrane [20], whereas the C-terminal part of PHB2 seems always responsible for binding other partners. Our data show that the long C-terminus region of PHB2 (amino acid 120 to 299) interacts with CaMK IV. This region of PHB2 has been also demonstrated to contain several domains which bind to several other proteins including PHB1 [21], HDAC1 [13], Ring finger 2 (RNF2) [7], estrogen receptor (ER) [8] and Akt [6]. As compared with Akt binding ability to PHB2, a C-terminal domain of PHB2 (amino acids 232\u2013299), which is not necessary for Akt binding, is indispensable but not sufficient for specific interaction with CaMK IV. PHB2 has been shown to have multiple binding partners in multiple cellular compartments. For example, mitochondrial PHB1 [21] and spningosine-1-phosphate (S1P) [22] interact and cooperate with PHB2 to maintain normal mitochondrial functions; PHB2 also bond to several transcription factors, such as ER [8], MyoD and MEF2 [6], and inhibited their transcriptional activities. It has been shown that cytoplasmic brefeldin A-inhibited guanine nucleotide-exchange protein 3 (Big 3) interacts with PHB2 and traps PHB2 in the cytoplasm to inhibit its nuclear translocation, which rescues ER alpha transcriptional activity from PHB2 inhibition [23].

            "text": "Several studies have indicated that the serine and tyrosine residues in PHB2 are phosphorylated [14], but phosphorylation of these sites in vitro and in vivo and upstream kinases has not been validated. We for first time mapped the exact serine phosphorylation site of PHB2 to serine91 and demonstrated that CaMK IV is one of its upstream serine/threonine kinases. Serine91 is present in the conserved PHB domain (amino acids 39\u2013201) and is highly evolutionarily conserved in human, mouse, rat, xenopus, zebrafish, drosophila and S. Pombe. However S. cerevisiae contains an alanine at this position and plants lost this phosphorylation motif completely, suggesting a gain of function at this point of divergence. It is interesting to note that this CaMKIV consensus motif is not conserved in PHB1, while threonine258 in PHB1, which is phosphorylated by Akt, is not conserved in PHB2 [26]. So far, there is no evidence to show that Akt could phosphorylate PHB2. Our previous data showed that Akt could interact with PHB2 but did not phosphorylate it [6]. These findings are striking, given the high degree of identity between the relevant sites in PHB1 and PHB2, and suggest that PHBs are differentially regulated by distinct mechanisms.",

            "text": "MEF2 transcription factors play central roles in the activation of the genetic programs that control cell differentiation, proliferation, morphogenesis, survival and apoptosis of a wide range of cell types [27]. CaMK IV is a potent activator of MEF2 activity. One of the mechanisms by which CaMK IV activates MEF2 is the CaMK IV phosphorylation of the transcriptional repressor HDAC5, resulting in the de-repression of the MEF2-dependent gene transcription [28], [29]. HDAC5 represses MEF2-dependent gene transcription by direct binding to MEF2 [30]. Phosphorylation of HDAC5 by CaMK IV leads to disruption of the interaction between MEF2 and HDAC5, which results in the translocation of HDA5 from nucleus to cytoplasm and releases the repression [28], [29], [31]. Although strong evidence suggest a role for CaMK in the transmission of signals that converge on HDACs, the existence of distinct signaling mechanisms that control HDACs remains possible. Indeed, our results provide another potential mechanism underlying the activation of MEF2 by CaMKIV: CaMKIV phosphorylates another MEF2 repressor PHB2 to relieve its inhibition of MEF2. Our previous study showed that PHB2 interacts with MEF2 and represses MEF2 activity by further recruiting HDAC1. To explore whether similar mechanism is subjected to HDAC5 after PHB2 is phosphorylated by CaMK IV, we performed the subcellular localization and co-immunoprecipitation assays. However, we neither could detect obvious translocation of PHB2 induced by CaMK IVca using GFP fluorescence assay (unpublished data) nor demonstrate CaMK IVca decreases the interaction between PHB2 and MEF2 or PHB2 and HDAC1 using co-immunoprecipitation assay (unpublished data). Thus, how CaMK IV signaling rescues MEF2 from repression by PHB2 is currently under further investigation.",
