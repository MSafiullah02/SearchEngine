            "text": "Georeferenced digital aerial photographs were used to assess changes in overstorey vegetation cover since 1948 in the Victoria River District, Northern Territory, Australia, across a range of lowland tropical savanna habitats and with explicit consideration of known and variable site-specific grazing and fire management histories. Vegetation surveys at corresponding locations on the ground identified five distinct woody vegetation communities defined primarily by water drainage and secondarily by soil characteristics. Air-photo analyses revealed that, contrary to popular perceptions and in contrast to results from other habitats, there has been no generalized net increase in overstorey woody vegetation cover across the full range of lowland savanna habitats. Rather, different habitats exhibited distinctly different vegetation change mechanisms: low-lying seasonally inundated 'wet' habitats have experienced woody vegetation increase since 1948, whereas well-drained 'dry' habitats have experienced overstorey vegetation stability or loss. In almost every instance woody vegetation increase could be attributed to the invasion or proliferation of a single species, Melaleuca minutifolia F.Muell. The extent of M. minutifolia increase was unrelated to historical grazing/fire regime. Demographic analyses for this species revealed that recruitment was often episodic and that synchronized recruitment events occurred uniformly across the full range of historical management treatments, most likely as a consequence of favourable climatic conditions in years with an extended wet season. Heavy grazing facilitated juvenile survival and/or recruitment, most likely by reducing grassy fuel loads and eliminating landscape fire. We conclude that while there has been no generalized net increase in overstorey woody vegetation cover in lowland environments, savanna dynamics are complex, and multiple change mechanisms have occurred simultaneously in different habitats, some of which have been significantly transformed since 1948. Where net woody vegetation increase has occurred it is primarily a natural consequence of episodic M. minutifolia establishment in climatically favourable years, but the extent and magnitude of this effect is likely mediated by fire/ grazing regime.",

            "text": "Increases in woody plant abundance in response to grazing and associated changes in fire regime have been reported almost universally in savanna ecosystems around the world (Archer 2002 ; references therein). Woody vegetation increase can reduce grass productivity (Harrington & Johns 1990; Scanlon & Burrows 1990; Dyer et al . 1997 ) thereby threatening the longterm economic viability of pastoral enterprises. Largescale changes in the structure or condition of savanna habitats may also compromise wildlife habitat and contribute to the decline of biodiversity (Franklin 1999; Woinarski et al . 2001) . Furthermore, changes in woody plant abundance that are anthropogenic in origin acquire economic and political importance in light of national carbon-sequestration budgets arising from international climate-change agreements (Burrows et al . 1998) . Despite the obvious importance of the topic there has been little progress toward developing a general theory of savanna woody vegetation dynamics, and there is a remarkably sparse empirical database upon which to build such a theory. Here we examine the landscape-scale response of an Australian tropical savanna subjected to an intensive grazing regime for different lengths of time.",

            "text": "In the Victoria River District (VRD) of the Northern Territory, Australia, there has been widespread speculation and limited inquiry into the extent and nature of woody vegetation increase in savanna environments over the past century. For instance, Lewis (2002) , using repeat photography, documented woody vegetation increase that is in some locations very dramatic, most notably on major watercourses and alluvial floodplains. Scientists and pastoral managers consistently report the spread of several tree species (such as 'rosewood', Terminalia volucris R.Br. ex Benth. and 'bauhinia', Lysiphylum cunninghammii (F. M. Bailey) de Wit) onto formerly treeless grasslands on cracking-clay soils in the VRD (Dyer et al . 1997; Crowley & Garnett 1998; A. Andersen, pers. comm. 1999) . Such clear evidence of vegetation 'thickening' in the region, while undisputed, is largely anecdotal in nature and thus impossible to assess quantitatively, and the causal mechanisms are unknown. Managers and scientists in the VRD tend to emphasize the role of changing fire management rather than grazing, citing the cessation of traditional Aboriginal burning that followed the establishment of pastoralism in the region (Jacklyn 2000) . In practice, fire and grazing are interrelated. For example, Bowman (1997) demonstrated that in the VRD the Australian boab (Adansonia gibbosa (A.Cunn.) Guymer ex Baum) proliferates on heavily grazed lowland habitats where grassy fuels are too diminished to support fire, but declines on sandstone plateaux where intense fires are common. A similar mechanism is apparently responsible for observed woodland thickening in grazed savanna habitats in northern Queensland, Australia (Burrows et al . 1998 ). Crowley and Garnett (1998) reported that the spread of Melaleuca viridiflora Sol. Ex Gaertn. ('ti-tree') has effectively transformed extensive grasslands and mixed woodlands on Cape York Peninsula into ti-tree woodlands. The authors attributed these changes to the reduction in fire frequency and/or inten-sity that accompanied the transition from traditional Aboriginal management to pastoral management (see also Crowley & Garnett 2000) , but noted that the actual timing of M. viridiflora recruitment events depended upon favourable climatic conditions even where fire regimes were consistently favourable.",

Fensham and Fairfax (2003) assessed changes in woody vegetation cover on a very large scale across the whole of the VRD (120 000 km 2 ) and detected general increases in vegetation cover across a range of habitat types. The scale of their study was too large to consider site-specific management variables, and extended into regions not affected by pastoral operations. The authors suggested that observed increases were a consequence of naturally fluctuating climatic conditions. Similarly, Bowman et al . (2001) documented generally increasing woodiness across a range of habitats in Litchfield National Park (200 km north-east of the VRD), an area with no significant history of pastoralism and minimal recent anthropogenic disturbance. Observed changes were apparently the result of increased rainfall in recent decades, changing fire regime, or both.",

            "text": "Very few studies have systematically examined savanna dynamics across a range of habitat settings with explicit consideration of site-specific management histories. One exception is the study by Bowman et al . (2001) which reported increases in woody vegetation across the full range of a steep topographic gradient, from lowland plains to an adjoining plateau. In contrast, in the VRD where lowland environments are heavily grazed, emerging evidence indicates that vegetation responses to different fire and grazing treatments vary significantly across the major topographic gradient, i.e. from seasonally inundated floodplains of major rivers to the effectively ungrazed and unmanaged sandstone plateaux (Fig. 1 ). Sharp and Bowman (2004) reported that on sandstone plateaux, changes in total woody vegetation cover are directionally random, spatially patchy, and unrelated to vegetation composition, despite the general decline of fire-sensitive species since the cessation of traditional Aboriginal fire management. Observed change patterns among fire-tolerant dominant tree species are likely a consequence of natural cycles of die-back and re-growth in response to spatially heterogeneous stochastic rainfall events. In contrast, Sharp and Whittaker (2003) demonstrated the widespread and dramatic increase of woody vegetation on alluvial floodplains, apparently a direct consequence of severe overgrazing by cattle and the resulting absence of landscape fire since the 1970s. The focus of the present study is the intervening lowland habitats between plateau and river. Because the management histories of different portions of the study area are variable and known, this setting provides an opportunity to consider the combined effects of different levels of grazing and landscape burning. This paper examines patterns of change in woody vegetation cover across the full range of lowland habitats, not merely where anecdotal evidence suggests that changes have occurred, and assesses these patterns with explicit consideration of site-specific historical management treatments. The paper also explores in greater depth the ecological mechanisms responsible for observed thickening on low-lying 'wet' habitats dominated by Melaleuca and Terminalia spp. Mechanisms responsible for observed changes on 'dry' lowland habitats, supporting tall open Eucalyptus and Corymbia woodlands, are explored elsewhere (Sharp unpubl. data) .",

The property is bounded by two seasonally flooded tidal rivers, the Victoria River to the south and the Fitzmaurice River to the north, and is dissected by rugged sandstone plateaux and steep escarpment cliffs. The climate of the region is monsoonal. Mean annual rainfall is 938.5 cm y -1 , 85% of which falls between November and March. Mean daily maximum temperature is 34.8 \u040a C (Bureau of Meteorology 2001) . This study is located within the pastoral lowlands of the Angallarri Valley, extending 75 km north and east from Bradshaw Homestead. The study area is bounded to the west by the escarpment cliffs of the Yambarran Plateau and to the east by the braided river channels of the seasonal Angallarri River. The entire study area is relatively flat. Slope was measured at each of 67 vegetation survey sites (below), and varied from 0 to 4%; mean slope was 1.2%. However relatively minor variations in slope have a major impact on vegetation. Many savanna species do not tolerate seasonal inundation, so distinct habitats are effectively defined by water drainage (Fig. 1) . Soils and landforms within the study area have been described by Hollingsworth and Aldrick (1997) , vegetation by Orr (1997, 1999) , and fire regimes by Yates et al . (2000) . Soils are primarily alluvial deposits, ranging from cracking clay or clay-loam soils on low-lying plains to loamy and sandy soils on gently sloping rises nearer the escarpment. Vegetation varies from nearly treeless grassland on cracking-clay plains to tall open woodland on colluvial rises and rocky escarpment foot-slopes.",

Probably for much of that time the area was actively managed on a landscape scale, most notably by intensive and deliberate seasonal burning in accordance with traditional management practices (see Bowman 1998) . The region was colonized by Europeans and converted for pastoral use in the later part of the nineteenth century. Colonization resulted in major disruption of Aboriginal management activities, but Aboriginal people provided most of the labour force for the pastoral industry until the late 1950s, and adapted their traditional fire use to pastoralism. Pastoral managers still burn their pastures in some contexts (Lewis 1991) , but unmanaged areas tend to burn both more often and with higher intensity than do areas under active pastoral management (Dyer et al . 1997; Crowley & Garnett 2000 ; see also Yates et al . 2000) .",

Early pastoral operations were extensive and effectively uncontrolled. Fences were poor and scattered, and cattle numbers were naturally limited by poor pasture quality and the relative absence of fresh water late in the dry season (Gardener et al . 1990; Winter 1991) . Pastoral intensification began in the 1960s with the establishment of effective fencing and artificial watering points. Stocking rates increased dramatically and peaked in the mid-1970s. Significantly, though, the northward extension of fenced pastoral operations in the Angallarri Valley was slowed by access difficulties. Several large paddocks were only established in the 1980s, and large areas of suitable lowland habitat were never converted to controlled pastoralism (Sharp unpubl. data) . The property was acquired by the Australian Defence Force in 1997 for use as a military training area, and was de-stocked in 1998-1999, just prior to the commencement of this study. The existence of edaphically similar habitats that have been grazed intensively for different lengths of time makes the property an ideal location on which to examine the interaction of landscape burning and controlled pastoralism in north Australian savanna environments.",

Vegetation cover at each location was assessed by the following sequential methodology, using ERMapper vs. 6.1 (Earth Resources Mapping, Perth, Australia) image analysis software: 1. Hard-copy photographs were scanned in 8-bit greyscale and combined to produce georectified mosaics (geoposition SE < 20 m) of the entire study area with a resolution of 1 pixel equal to 2 m. 2. Geographically identical sections were excised from both the 1948 and 1993/7 parent mosaics at the 114 mapped locations. Excised mosaic segments generally measured 600 m \u03eb 600 m for practical reasons related to ground-truthing. However, smaller segments were sometimes utilized ( n = 19) in order to avoid landscape discontinuities or imperfections in the hardcopy photographs that would otherwise obstruct the photographic vegetation signature. The smallest mapped location measured 400 m \u03eb 400 m. 3. The excised images were blur-filtered to remove graininess effects caused by the paper texture of the hardcopy photographs. 4. The images were contrast-enhanced to emphasize the boundaries of individual tree canopies. 5. A numerical greyscale threshold (0-255) was chosen to yield a binary classification of tree cover versus background. The threshold was chosen visually by on-screen comparison of the binary image with the original parent image and continual adjustment of the threshold until the boundaries of individual tree canopies matched most closely. The selection of an appropriate threshold level was greatly aided by zooming and roaming within the parent image to compare individual tree canopy boundaries at high magnification. 6. Percent woody vegetation cover was calculated from the binary canopy classification for both 1948 and 1993/7 at each mapped location. This methodology has been shown to produce reliable estimates of overstorey woody vegetation cover (Sharp & Whittaker 2003; Sharp & Bowman 2004) .",

Survey sites were selected without reference to the 1948 aerial photographic mosaic, i.e. without regard for the vegetation change history of particular locations.

The fitted line for Group 5 (slope = 0.79 \u03ee 0.06; n = 38) indicates a significant tendency for vegetation cover decline on tall-open woodlands dominated by C. latifolia and/or Eucalyptus tectifica. Vegetation change on rocky foot-slopes (Group 3) has been negative (slope = 0.35 \u03ee 0.13; n = 5). The observed net decline in woody vegetation cover for these two groups was a consequence of complex interactions between overstorey trees and understorey shrubs in response to changing grazing and fire regimes, as explored fully in Sharp (unpubl. data) .",

It generally occurred as the dominant species on low-lying seasonally inundated plains like those included in Group 1, but also occurred in the understorey of tall open Eucalyptus or Corymbia woodlands (i.e. Groups 4 and 5) in locations where drainage was poor. Invasion and/or growth of M. minutifolia was clearly responsible for observed woody vegetation increases on Group 1 sites. Many of these sites were essentially mono-specific stands. Within Group 1 the percent dominance of M. minutifolia was significantly (P = 0.032) related to RCI category; on sites with increasing cover (n = 8) M. minutifolia accounted for an average of 59.4% of Fig. 5 . Locations of at which overstorey woody vegetation cover was assessed by aerial photographic analysis. Where woody vegetation composition is known locations are assigned to one of five TWINSPAN groups. The direction of woody vegetation cover change (1948-1993/7 ) is indicated at each location. Paddocks are assigned to one of three grazing categories corresponding to the date of paddock establishment. total woody basal area, compared to 20.9% on sites where cover was unchanging (n = 3). Melaleuca minutifolia may also have been responsible for increasing vegetation cover in other habitats. On two of three Group 5 sites exhibiting dramatic vegetation increase (sites 9 and 31, Fig. 6 ), M. minutifolia (basal area of 1.00 and 3.06 m 2 ha -1 , respectively) had abundances equal to or greater than those of the dominant overstorey tree on those sites, Corymbia latifolia (basal area of 1.01 and 1.25 m 2 ha -1 , respectively). Demographic distributions for both species on those sites suggest that understorey invasion by M. minutifolia was actually replacing a pre-existing Corymbia woodland (see below; see also Sharp unpubl. data) .",

However, nowhere within the study area was T. platyptera sufficiently abundant to account for a large proportion of total woody vegetation cover (see Table 1 ).

The steeper slope and negative intercept for site 36 likely reflects faster initial growth conditions when the site was relatively treeless (i.e. 8.2% cover in 1948) and newly established trees were relatively free from competition. Our assumption that growth rings are annual was unsupported, but appears reasonable in the context of seasonally waterlogged habitats in a monsoonal environment. Note that due to the high incidence of hollow/rotten tree cores among larger Melaleuca trees, very few individuals of diameter >10 cm were aged. Age estimates based on extrapolation of the above growth relationships to larger trees should be treated with appropriate caution.",

None of these histograms conformed to the classic reverse-J distribution (with abundant juveniles and gradually decreasing abundances of larger size-classes) generally associated with continuous stand replacement. Some histograms revealed almost no juvenile trees. Nearly every histogram revealed identifiable demographic peaks. Recruitment of M. minutifolia seedlings thus appears to have been episodic, although some recruitment apparently also occurred in off-peak years. For M. minutifolia low woodlands (i.e. Group 1 sites; n = 6), histograms at every location revealed a distinct demographic peak at diameter = 10-11 cm, and a lesser peak at diameter = 13-14 cm (as in Fig. 8a ). This pattern was consistent across the full range of fire/grazing variation. Utilizing estimated sizeage relationships derived above, these peaks represent establishment events in approximately 1973-1975 and 1966-1968, respectively . Where M. minutifolia existed in the understorey of tall open Corymbia/Eucalyptus woodlands (Groups 4-5; n = 5) four of five histograms revealed high abundances of juvenile trees, with abundances dropping off rapidly at size classes greater than 6 cm (as in Figs 8b, c) . This pattern suggests that M. minutifolia may have only recently invaded (since 1986, with peak establishment in 1990) these habitats.

First, the perception of general woody vegetation increase in the region (e.g. Jacklyn 2000) does not apply within the present study area. Net overstorey vegetation cover change since 1948 has been zero or slightly negative. This finding cautions the uncritical acceptance of repeat landscape photography as proof of widespread landscape-scale changes (as in Lewis 2002) . Change was neither uniform nor random. Different woody vegetation groups showed clear tendencies for either vegetation increase or decline, a result which suggests that different change mechanisms have occurred in different habitats. In general it appears that low-lying habitats with poor drainage (i.e. 'wet' habitats) have experienced woody vegetation increase, whereas 'dry' habitats have experienced woody vegetation stability or loss, a conclusion that extends also to adjacent floodplains and sandstone plateaux (Sharp & Whittaker 2003; Sharp & Bowman 2004) . Ecological mechanisms responsible for changes on dry lowland habitats (Groups 3-5) are examined fully in Sharp (ubpubl. data) . Subsequent analysis in this paper focuses on change mechanisms on wet lowland habitats (Groups 1-2).",

Species identified as invasive in these habitats by Dyer et al. (1997) were present in Group 2 (see Table 1 ) but the group as a whole showed no significant tendency for either woody vegetation increase or decline. This may reflect the fact that anecdotal reports of increases on cracking-clay plains were all derived from grazed areas, while Group 2 sites in the present study were located across the full range of historical management treatments. A related study on nearby alluvial floodplains with a history of heavy grazing (Sharp & Whittaker 2003 ) recorded significant increases on cracking-clay plains dominated by T. volucris, consistent with other anecdotal reports in the region, and a pastoral manager of Bradshaw Station (I. McBean, pers. comm. 2000) has reported a general increase in tree abundance on grazed crackingclay plains in recent decades. Where increasing woody vegetation abundance was observed by air-photo analysis it was almost entirely due to the spread or invasion of Melaleuca minutifolia. Importantly, the magnitude of vegetation change on sites dominated exclusively by M. minutifolia (i.e. Group 1 sites) did not vary significantly relative to grazing history (Table 4) , a result which suggests that observed increases on these habitats were not driven primarily by changing grazing/fire regimes.",

The recruitment events responsible for these demographic peaks probably occurred in 1973-1975 and 1966-1968, respectively . That this demographic pattern was consistent across the full range of grazing treatments (see, e.g. Figs 8a,b) suggests that these recruitment events were a product of climatic conditions that affected the entire study area, and not of site-specific management histories. Nonetheless numerical demographic indices indicated that fire/grazing regime also affected M. minutifolia recruitment. Melaleuca minutifolia stands in grazing category 1 were skewed toward a preponderance of smaller trees, with corresponding decreases in average tree diameter and the proportion of adult trees (Table 4 ; Fig. 8b,d) . These results probably reflect reduced fire mortality among seedlings and juveniles on heavily grazed/infrequently burnt locations. The most recent establishment event appears to have occurred since 1986 (i.e. diameter \u05456 cm).",

Furthermore, on some locations within these habitats where aerial photographs revealed an increase in woody vegetation cover since 1948, extreme densities of small M. minutifolia trees indicated that the species had been recently invasive (e.g. Fig. 8b ). Such invasions were only evident on grazed locations, probably a direct consequence of reduced fire mortality under grazing (compare Fig. 8b,c) . Sharp (unpubl. data) demonstrated that M. minutifolia was actually only one of several species proliferating in the understorey of tall open woodlands subjected to heavy grazing, and that such invasions contributed to the decline and even complete disappearance of the original overstorey woodland.",

Arrows indicate the approximate dates of episodic Melaleuca minutifolia establishment events. favourable to seedling recruitment were in the past sufficiently powerful to drive net woody vegetation increase within M. minutifolia low woodlands even where grazing was light and burning was frequent. It is likely that germination requires specific climatic conditions but that subsequent survival is affected by grazing and fire regime. This is apparently the case for M. viridiflora, a related species known to have increased dramatically in portions of northern Queensland. Melaleuca viridiflora is thought to require multiple consecutive years with above-average rainfall for seedling establishment to occur (Crowley & Garnett 1998) . Melaleuca minutifolia has similar habitat affinities, requiring seasonal inundation for establishment and growth. Nonetheless climate records (Fig. 9) showed that neither identified establishment event (1966-1968 and 1973-1975) corresponded to periods of uniquely high cumulative rainfall or to any other identifiable climatic trend. Net annual rainfall is unlikely to predict M. minutifolia establishment. Other climatic factors like the length of the wet season may be the primary predictors (Crowley & Garnett 1998) .",

We propose that observed M. minutifolia increases are a consequence of the maturation of episodic cohorts that established during favourable hydrological conditions in the 1960s and again in the early to mid-1970s. Demographic evidence suggests that conditions favouring M. minutifolia establishment recurred in the 1980s but that subsequent seedling survival and recruitment has been affected by fire regime, which is in turn a direct product of grazing intensity (Fig. 3) . Where grazing has been sufficiently intense to reduce or eliminate fire mortality among M. minutifolia seedlings, the stage has been set for further woody vegetation increase within M. minutifolia low woodlands, and also for M. minutifolia proliferation within the understorey of tall open Eucalyptus and Corymbia woodlands. In the latter instance M. minutifolia proliferation may result in the decline of the pre-existing overstorey tree species (Sharp unpubl. data) .",

Suggestions of landscape-scale processes based upon anecdotal evidence derived from particular habitats preferentially (Jacklyn 2000; Lewis 2002 ) should be interpreted with caution. Even where perceptions of change are accurate it may be impossible to distinguish 'anthropogenic' management effects from 'natural' climatedriven dynamics. This fact will make carbon-storage accounting, for which only anthropogenic changes are politically relevant, exceedingly difficult. In this study we assert that observed M. minutifolia increases are primarily climate-driven, a conclusion consistent with Fensham and Fairfax (2003) , but also that the extent and magnitude of this effect is mediated by management regime, as in Crowley and Garnett (1998) . Other adjacent and interspersed habitats are experiencing dramatic changes which are evidently managementdriven, and which almost certainly affect pastoral productivity (Sharp & Whittaker 2003; Sharp unpubl. data) .

The spread of M. minutifolia may therefore be seen as a positive outcome for conservation management. However, where M. minutifolia has proliferated in the understorey of pre-existing Corymbia woodlands, the demographic distributions of the overstorey stands suggest that M. minutifolia invasion may be destructive of these habitats (Sharp unpubl. data) . Similar structural transformations are thought to affect wildlife populations in other savanna environments (Franklin 1999; Woinarski et al. 2001 ), but in the absence of habitat-specific data, any assertions about the impacts on wildlife of vegetation changes are bound to be purely speculative.",
