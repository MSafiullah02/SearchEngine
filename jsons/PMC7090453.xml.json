Cough is a common event following premedication with an opioid such as fentanyl (given prior to induction of anesthesia) and can be prevented by a single intravenous dose of lidocaine.3 One of the reasons complete muscle relaxation during endotracheal intubation in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients is recommended is to reduce coughing.4 In addition, coughing and bucking are also prevalent events during extubation. Emergence coughing is a challenging issue and a variety of medications have been proposed to prevent it. Again, administration of intravenous lidocaine (which is readily available) prior to tracheal extubation can effectively reduce emergence coughing without any other significant side-effects.5 Consideration should be given to injections of lidocaine at the beginning and the end of any procedure requiring intubation and/or extubation in patients with COVID-19.\n",
