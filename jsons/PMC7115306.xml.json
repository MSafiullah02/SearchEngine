            "text": "In this article we explore the general utility of recent work from disaster research for the enhancement of contemporary methods and approaches to Environmental Assessment (EA). In particular we discuss the potential disaster research has for assessing slowly evolving and under-appraised environmental problems, including environmentally related health impacts and those problems involving the cumulative impacts of the ever changing relations between the urban, ex-urban and rural regions. To illustrate and discuss this potential of disaster research we give context and substance to our analysis by focusing on two case studies, the first involving water contamination/pollution problems in rural Ontario and the other focusing on the changing ecological and social landscapes of areas which surround the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). These particular cases were selected because frequently EA may neglect or at least minimize the potentially significant impacts of the urban/ex-urban/rural dynamic. This may be perhaps because of the complexities inherently involved in this dynamic, often involving longer time scales and expansive distances, thus making the incorporation and consideration of the factors related to this dynamic difficult. Nonetheless, the adoption of certain principles and the general orientation of disaster research, especially if coupled with cumulative impact assessment, may better enable environmental assessors to broaden the conventional lens of EA. In turn, this may facilitate the identification of not only the physical and biological antecedents to many environmental problems, but their social and political economic undercurrents as well, thereby providing a means through which some of the difficulties of incorporating the urban/ex-urban/rural dynamic can be addressed. Notably, the analysis of both the physical and social dimensions in a disaster research inspired EA process will enable assessors to more effectively grapple with the vexing issues related to the complex cumulative and latent effects of many understudied and conventionally neglected environmental problems. We begin with an overview of recent approaches in disaster research that are of relevance to EA.",

            "text": "Situated within the agricultural heartland of Ontario, the town of Walkerton is located on the Saugeen River about 150 km northwest of Toronto and 30 km east of the shores of Lake Huron. Although relatively close to the Great Lakes, the town is entirely dependent upon groundwater that is drawn from wells. During the third week of May 2000, Walkerton (population: 4800) became the site of the largest outbreak of a waterborne infectious disease in Canadian history. After a public outcry, an independent inquiry was commissioned a month later to determine the causes of the outbreak as well as to fulfill the extended mandate of making recommendations about how best to manage the water supplies in the province. The Inquiry concluded that the contamination of the municipal water supply occurred after a period of very intense rainfall whereupon cattle manure containing the pathogen E. coli O157:H7 spread on the fields of a nearby farm was washed into a particular well (Walkerton Inquiry, 2002). As this pathogen can only survive in groundwater for very short periods of time, it was suspected that rapid flow of water contaminated with the pathogen was able to reach the municipal water supply because of the presence of fractures in the carbonate substrata structure of the region. Aside from identifying the source of contamination, the Inquiry Commission also identified a list of other factors that contributed to the outbreak, including malfeasance on the part of the local water operator and serious deficiencies in the provincial regulatory framework that governs water management.",

One of the difficulties faced in identifying the particular pathogen involved in the Walkerton case was that E. coli O157:H7 was normally associated with food-borne, and not waterborne, outbreaks. Sometimes referred to as \u201chamburger disease\u201d, illness due to E. coli O157:H7 first began to be recognized as a newly emerging public health problem in the 1980s with the onset of several sporadic outbreaks throughout North America (Nadakavukaren, 2000). From a DIA perspective, the association of the disease with food served as distracting decoy phenomenon.",

Such an orientation has practical implications for EA, which may benefit from such an expanded perspective by employing a wider scan that would be alert to broader social and ecological trends (for example, see Krieg, 1998, Krieg, 1995 for trends regarding the distribution of hazardous waste in North America). In this spirit, let us consider some of the relevant trends in terms of the Walkerton disaster, starting with that related to increased incidence of water contamination in the North American context. By being knowledgeable about such trends, EA processes may be redirected to focus on the more likely scenarios in environmental and land use planning.",

            "text": "One relevant trend that EA professionals may want to consider is the increase in new and emerging diseases more generally, as it is likely that the protection of groundwater from such threats will become an issue of growing importance in the future. In recent times, Western societies have witnessed the rise of a new class of emerging (and re-emerging) pathogens that are extremely insidious and virulent, including, to name just a few: the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, HIV/AIDS, West Nile, Huntavirus, Ebola, the Lyme disease virus, the avian flu virus, the monkey pox virus, and the hoof-and-mouth pathogen (Drexler, 2003, Levy and Fischetti, 2003, Garrett, 1994, Institute of Medicine, 1992). The bacteria E. coli O157:H7 involved in the contamination of the Walkerton groundwater is another example from this new group of pathogenic threats. The emergence of these new pathogens has several important implications for planning in general and rural planning in particular. First, it needs to be recognized that a wide range of social and environmental factors are involved in the evolution of these pathogens as well as in the onset of the respective disease epidemics themselves. Such factors include: ecological, human demographic and behavioural changes; travel and commerce; technology and industry; microbial adaptation and change; and the breakdown of public health measures. For this reason, whether contamination occurs within the groundwater source, through the food distribution system, or through the air and soils, the wider contextual factors that could amplify or mitigate the spread of the pathogen need to be considered as part of the assessment and planning process. In particular, the possible interactions of such factors need to be studied. For example, as is argued below, the need to monitor groundwater for pathogens may not be possible under the tight fiscal circumstances that many resource-based communities face.",

            "text": "The rural geographic dimension of the new and emerging pathogenic threats is often neglected in groundwater management. Part of the latency of the disaster incubation involved in disease outbreaks is a function of the fact that most of the relevant incubating processes and factors are occurring in remote locations \u2014 they are \u201cunder the radar\u201d of most observers. Such tendencies are especially worth noting in light of such disaster incubation elements as rigidities in institutional beliefs (as for example with respect to rural versus urban, as well as municipal versus provincial versus federal government agencies) and neglect of outside complaints (as for example, the neglect of the input and concerns of farmers by government agencies). Furthermore, most of the new and emerging pathogens are based on animals raised or otherwise inhabiting relatively remote areas. For example, it is thought that the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) originates from the simian reservoir in the rural jungles of East Africa (Institute of Medicine, 1992); the SARS coronavirus in the palm civet cat reservoir of rural Southern China (Guan et al., 2003, Martina et al., 2003) and the avian flu virus in the wild duck and fowl reservoir of the same region (Institute of Medicine, 1992). The crossover of the pathogen from the animal to the human reservoir is influenced by distinctly social processes; thus, for example, it has been noted that the paving of the Kinshasa Highway through the forests of the Rift Valley led to increased traffic thereby facilitating the spread of disease from remote posts to urban areas as prostitutes working the stretch of road plied their trade. Local doctors estimate that as many as 30% of those living in this area are infected with HIV (Preston, 1994:382), while strong evidence indicates that the SARS coronavirus crossover occurred in live animal markets in urban centers where animals were brought in from rural areas to be sold. The significance of the interrelationship between humans, animals and the environment highlights the importance of the interface of urban\u2013rural areas and particularly the encroachment of humans into formerly untouched environs, as seen by the rise in cases of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) (Buck and Aron, 2001:32) and Lyme disease. Incidence rates increased as exposure to the vectors transmitting the viral agent increased as development into forested areas brought humans into closer contact with deer mice carrying the sin nombre virus in the case of HPS and wilderness ticks hosting the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and carried in songbirds and mice in the case of Lyme disease (Bourette, 2005).",

            "text": "A second general trend refers to increased incidence of contamination within rural areas themselves. Although drinking water contamination problems tend to be associated with developing nations \u2013 the World Health Organization notes that the leading cause of illness and deaths in most developing countries is attributable to gastrointestinal infections from the ingestion of water containing pathogens (Nadakavukaren, 2000) \u2013 the Walkerton outbreak dramatically illustrates that the waterborne route of the disease may pose an equal, if not greater, threat to public health in the North American, and particularly, Canadian context. The potential for groundwater contamination is particularly noteworthy in light of the finding that approximately 90% of Canada's drinking water is stored as groundwater (Howard, 2000). At the same time, almost 70% of those reliant on groundwater as a source of drinking water live in rural areas (Howard, 2000). The Center for Disease Control and Prevention data indicates that between 1971\u20131992 there were on average 31 outbreaks of waterborne diseases per year in the United States (Nadakavukaren, 2000) while there were 39 published reports of waterborne outbreaks/incidents associated with drinking water in Ontario alone from 1974 to 1996 (Edge et al., 2003). In many cases, waterborne disease afflictions run their course in 5\u201310 days and the victim recovers completely without treatment (Nadakavukaren, 2000:337). As a result, it should be noted that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Nadakavukaren, 2000) estimates that for every case of waterborne disease identified, 25 more never appear in the statistics because of haphazard reporting. Edge et al. (2003) estimate that only one-tenth of waterborne outbreaks are reported. Thus the problem of pathogenic contamination of drinking water may be much more pervasive than what is currently realized. In this way, the neglect of the issue of pathogenic contamination of groundwater may in fact illustrate Turner's observation that in disaster incubation, there is a psychological tendency to minimize an emergent threat. Again, EA would clearly benefit by being cognizant and vigilant of such tendencies.",

In this connection, the EPA has found that the leading source of pollution of contaminated rivers in North America is agricultural runoff (Mallory, 2000, Nadakavukaren, 2000). In the case of Ontario, agricultural runoff in the form of manure (i.e. nutrients), as opposed to herbicides or pesticides, is particularly problematic because of the nature and type of farming practiced in this region. Reflecting a more general trend throughout North America, from the Second World War onward, agriculture in the province has become more industrialized, with fewer farms that are larger in size and growing many more animals per farm. Thus, for example, although today agriculture and food is Ontario's second largest industry, employing some 640,000 people (OMAFRA, 2000b), the number of farmers has dropped dramatically over time \u2013 between 1951 and 1998 the number of dairy farmers in Ontario went from approximately 40,000 to 7200; while the number of pork producers dropped from 93,000 to 5500 (OMAFRA, 2000b). Notably, Walkerton itself is situated within one of the rural Ontario counties with the highest number of cattle per unit area grown in what are referred to as \u201cfactory farms\u201d (Nikiforuk, 2000).",

For example, a survey of groundwater quality in farm wells across Ontario found that 30% of the wells had bacteria levels above the safety guidelines (Michael Goss cited by Rankine and Boyd, 1998). Second, a Health Canada study published in 1999 found that those counties with the highest cattle density (including Walkerton) routinely registered the highest rates of E. coli O157:H7 infection in the province between 1990 and 1995 (Nikiforuk, 2000). Further still, for several years prior to the outbreak, Ontario Ministry of Environment inspectors were aware that the well contaminated in Walkerton was vulnerable to contamination by surface water (referred to as GUDI \u2014 groundwater under the direct influence of surface water) and that the Ontario Drinking Water Objectives of 1994 required that such sources be monitored continuously for chlorine residuals and turbidity, which they were not in the case of Walkerton (Walkerton Inquiry, 2002). If such knowledge existed, the pertinent question that arises is why were preventative planning measures not taken and how could such information be incorporated into effective drinking water management and planning practice? In other words, to use the lexicon of DIA, why were danger signals missed?

First, it suggests that other similar disasters may be incubating, since water-related incidents tend to be underreported and since monitoring has been shown to be frequently inadequate. Ex-urban areas appear to be at particular risk as the hazards associated with factory farming accumulate and converge. The relatively brief history of farming on such a scale makes it difficult to understand its implications fully and in historical context. Second, the case points to the risks of incomplete or partial approaches to monitoring in which some of the risk factors may be watched, but less so in relation to other factors. Over time, key risk interrelationships may thus unfold but be missed until disaster strikes. Third, the case casts doubt on the reliability or effectiveness of environmental assessment processes to identify the probable cumulative effects of an activity like factory farming \u2014 or, more precisely, the recurring reality that many significant development activities are not subject to rigorous or formal assessment at all. Fourth, the case confirms the paradox of groundwater resources: they are relied on heavily but taken for granted, literally out of sight and mind most of the time.",

Not only did such communities have to deal with reductions in the transfer payment funds available to them, but, at the same time, they were forced to absorb the costs of new responsibilities and practices that were formerly conducted by higher levels of government (i.e. the downloading of costs and services from federal and provincial levels to the municipal level). The smaller tax base of rural communities meant that these municipalities did not have an abundance of public money available to them to invest in infrastructure and public projects. Consequently, they lacked the sophisticated equipment and facilities as well as the highly trained personnel generally found in larger cities. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that most of the recent outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 have occurred in municipalities with small water systems. (Nadakavukaren, 2000:602).",

The need to pay for private water testing was especially difficult for the town of Walkerton. To compete with other small towns in luring new residents, business and industry, inexpensive water is a major selling point, and Walkerton offered the cheapest water rates in the area even though its utility company was losing money (Perkel, 2002:30). Therefore, any additional financial costs associated with the water monitoring functions (such as privatized water testing) could not be easily assumed by the Walkerton Public Utilities Company (PUC). Furthermore, as part of Ontario's neo-liberal initiative to cut public spending, the number of inspections conducted by the Ministry of the Environment, the number of site visits and other contacts between MOE officials and municipal water officials, all decreased dramatically (Walkerton Inquiry, 2002). For example, from 1994 to 2000, annual planned inspections for the Walkerton region decreased from 25 to 10, the number of actual annual site inspections decreased from 16 to 10, while the amount of employee resources expended on municipal water requirements decreased from 10.17% to 5.12% (on a province-wide scale, the number of inspections fell by 50%)(Walkerton Inquiry, 2002).",

The reality is quite different and the speed of cumulative change is dramatic, with impacts that may or may not be perceived, assessed or managed. Sprawl continues despite greenbelts and moraine protection, leapfrogging over urban/rural boundaries as new subdivisions appear. Farmland is lost through severances or conversion, in some cases replaced by large residential estates and in many instances further fragmenting habitats and ecological corridors. Moraines are depleted or damaged by development. Groundwater resources are depleted or neglected. Big pipes traverse regions, distorting regional hydrological systems. Rivers and sub-watersheds are stressed. Factory farming intensifies contamination risks. Overall, cumulative impacts at the regional level are insidious, obscured by the urban/ex-urban/rural dynamic. Urban/rural boundaries have significance at administrative, geographic and psychological levels, but in an ecological sense these boundaries exist to a diminishing extent. What is assumed to be an urban shadow, with incremental influence over the hinterland, is in practice a more rapid, synergistic process of regional transformation. In this regard, the rural image that is cultivated in places like Headwaters Country can backfire, reinforcing visions of an undisturbed and salubrious setting even as irreversible change occurs.",

            "text": "The experience of environmental assessment (EA) has provided abundant evidence that impacts frequently originate from sources and pathways that are difficult to detect, assess and manage. Even as the art and science of EA continue to be refined, impacts are to a great extent becoming more difficult to detect and study \u2014 originating, accumulating and playing out in ways that undermine common assumptions. At the regional scale, the urban/ex-urban/rural dynamic exemplifies the complicated challenge of perceiving impacts early enough to influence their timely management. In this dynamic, when rapidly growing urban centers exert inordinate development pressure, sprawl transforms rural places to ex-urban, and less visible but insidious impacts unfold in remaining rural areas. In a context of increasingly globalized economic activity, this unfolding dynamic increases the challenges of cumulative impact assessment and management at the regional scale. The sustainability challenges facing rural and ex-urban places have been well documented in a variety of literature (for example, Audirac, 1997, Daniels, 1999, Duany et al., 2000, Nelson, 1992, Storper, 1997). In this article we have examined two types of change \u2013 an area level disaster and the specter of transformative regional change \u2013 in rural and ex-urban settings in Southern Ontario. In both cases, water systems, one underground and the other watershed-level, figure prominently. Both cases underline the need for more enlightened and sophisticated approaches to assessment and planning. At present, there is relatively little use of longer-term, wider scale and preventive approaches to planning for water in Southern Ontario, but accumulating experience with water crises of various scales should stimulate increased experimentation. We have argued here that the foundations of improved practice include: 1) use of disaster incubation analysis to consider a fuller range of present and historical risk factors; 2) increased use of advanced EA tools such as cumulative effects assessment (CEA) and strategic environmental assessment (SEA), and use of scenario planning to detect weak signals of problematic development trends, cumulative effects and future risk factors.",

They reflect the increasing vulnerability of rural and ex-urban places to an intensifying urban shadow along with global forces. The resulting challenges are complex, trans-jurisdictional and multi-scalar. The lurking risks and cumulative changes are compounded by incomplete approaches to assessment, underreporting, latency of risk phenomena and decoy issues. In the particular case of Southern Ontario, persistent urban sprawl ensures continued challenges. EA, in its advanced forms, when applied in a consistent and rigorous fashion and supplemented with innovative approaches such as those informed by disaster incubation analysis, could make a substantial difference and nudge the urban/ex-urban/rural dynamic toward a different pattern of planning, decisions and outcomes.",
