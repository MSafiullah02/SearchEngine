The United States is highly connected to the rest of the world, and importations occur largely as a result of air travel by U.S. residents and international visitors. We developed a model to assess the risk of measles virus importation from Europe, Asia, and Africa through air travel. We projected 308 (95% prediction interval, 151-518) total measles cases imported from 66 countries during 2006-2015; 290 importations were reported. The model projected a spike in importation risk from Israel during October 2018, coincident with large, importationtriggered outbreaks in New York and New Jersey. Our model shows U.S. importation risk primarily originates from European and Asian countries. Models such as this inform preemptive actions to mitigate infectious disease threats, but only if we prioritize global surveillance and data sharing.",

The rapid, long-distance transmission potential posed by global air travel has become more evident during the last two decades, particularly in the context of emerging pathogens. In 2002, SARS coronavirus emerged in China. It spread rapidly to 36 countries, transmitted largely by air travelers, causing 8,098 cases and 774 deaths worldwide 3 . Six years later, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic spread quickly across the world from Mexico; it caused 284,000 deaths worldwide and stoked widespread fear of a repeat 1918 influenza pandemic 4 .

Relying on global measles incidence data and 2006-2015 airline itinerary information for international arrivals into the United States from other countries, we quantified the potential for measles importation using a framework previously developed to model arbovirus spread 15, 16 . For simplicity, we broadly define this potential as the projected \"risk of importation\" and quantify it with crude estimates of the absolute number of importations per time period and the ratio of these importations between locations and time periods. Because a multitude of factors can modify how this potential for importation translates into actual imported cases, we focus on this projected potential and not the absolute estimates. We validated our approach with data on reported measles importations. This model provides the risk of measles importation, both where importations are most likely to occur (i.e., into which U.S. cities) and where they are most likely to originate (i.e., from which countries). This work provides a platform that public health officials can use for real-time risk estimates and demonstrates the value of global disease surveillance efforts.",

For some countries measles surveillance data were not available for all periods. Hence, we restricted our analysis for each country to months when data were available. The final data set comprised 7,260 country-months (92% of those possible over the study period). During this time, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 412 confirmed imported measles cases. Of these, 376 (91%) originated in one of the 66 countries included in our analysis, and 290 (70% of all importations) were reported during months when measles surveillance data were available from origin countries.

Global incidence of measles was characterized by annual periodicity, with several distinct outbreaks in Europe, Asia, and Africa ( Figure 1 ). In Africa, large outbreaks occurred in Malawi (134,000 cases; 2010), Nigeria (58,000 cases; 2013), Burkina Faso (54,000 cases; 2009), and Zambia (38,000 cases; 2010-11) [17] [18] [19] [20] . In Asia, a large measles outbreak occurred in the Philippines (59,000 cases; 2014), and both India and China reported substantial average annual case counts (34,000 and 47,000, respectively) 21 . In Europe, notable outbreaks occurred in Bulgaria (23,500 cases; 2009-10), France (16,000 cases; 2010-11), and Ukraine (2005-06: 42,000 cases; 2011-12: 14,000 cases) [21] [22] [23] . Overall, most travel to the United States originated from Europe (68%) and Asia (30%), with only 2% from Africa. In the most recent years, 2010-2015, travel volume increased consistently, by 4%, 6%, and 10% per year from Europe, Asia, and Africa, respectively ( Figure 2 ). .

In contrast, travel to the United States from all regions peaks in July and August ( Figure S3 ). The temporal alignment of incidence and travel is critical to importation risk.

We also compared the full model (with both travel and incidence data) to travel-only or incidence-only models, finding that the full model was significantly more likely to predict the reported importations (likelihood ratio [LR]=44 compared to incidence-only and LR=22 compared to travel-only; Table S5 ).

With increasing global incidence, the potential for reintroduction of measles virus into countries where the disease had been eliminated, particularly through air travel, poses a significant threat.

While herd immunity limits endemic transmission and large-scale outbreaks in the United States, without complete immunity (United States was estimated in 2010 to have 92% overall immunity), potential for transmission from importations remains. This becomes particularly problematic when infected travelers live or interact within clusters of susceptibility, producing even greater potential to spark local transmission [33] [34] [35] . To mitigate the risk posed by frequent reintroductions, it becomes critical that we understand when and from where infected travelers will arrive, and where they will go, enabling public health agencies to potentially limit their numbers through public awareness and vaccination and limit transmission through prioritized resources and rapid detection and response.",

Work by Sarkar et al. recently highlighted the potential to assign risk based on source case and travel data, and how importation can compound outbreak risk produced by non-medical exemptions 36 . Massad et al. estimated the number of imported measles cases into Saudi Arabia during Hajj, emphasizing the risk of transmission and global dissemination following the annual pilgrimage 37 . While these previous studies have demonstrated the value of accounting for both travel and case data, our study is the first to estimate monthly measles importation risk and numbers from international sources into the United States and validate them with detailed data on reported importations collected by the CDC. As we demonstrate, because measles incidence and travel fluctuate over time, correctly accounting for their synchrony through highly time-resolved estimation is critical to appropriately attribute risk. This time-resolution, coupled with measles-specific clinical characteristics (i.e., incubation time, time to characteristic rash), enabled us to accurately project the monthly number of measles importations from specific source countries to specific states in the United States As expected, we found that importation risk typically concentrates in states/districts with large populations or those with airports that serve as common ports of entry (e.g., New York, California, District of Columbia, and Massachusetts), though some exceptions were found (e.g., Hawaii). We found that two factors (cases of disease in the country of origin and air travel volume) combined to drive importation risk. Periods of elevated importation risk were generally the consequence of large-scale outbreaks (e.g., in France or the Philippines). However, the minimal importation risk produced by large outbreaks in Bulgaria and Malawi demonstrate the necessity of sufficient travel. Overall, both Asia and Europe contributed similar overall importation risk to the United States, with Asia's greater measles cases countering Europe's travel volume. Despite massive measles outbreaks and high incidence, Africa contributes only minimal estimated and reported risk, highlighting the critical importance of accounting not only for cases, but also connectivity.",

In October 2018, eight imported cases from Israel were identified in New York and New Jersey, resulting in outbreaks totaling at least 275 cases largely concentrated among the orthodox Jewish community 38 . Historically, Israel has presented a minimal importation risk to the United States, with only 5 total importations reported from 2006-2015 (we estimated 7). Using projected travel data and real-time surveillance data, our model estimated a dramatic increase in risk, peaking in October 2018, coincident with an outbreak of 4,250 reported in Israel.

Age, for example, is typically associated with infection risk (through susceptibility and contact) and individual likelihood of traveling (e.g. travel purpose, destination) 39, 40 . Traveler's countries of residence, which was not available at the granularity needed and thus not accounted for, may impact the probability of infection: U.S. residents constituted 40% of international travel to the United States, but 62% of imported measles cases (during 2001-2016) 28 . However, the travel data do account for the actual origin country and U.S. destination state/state group, giving confidence to our attribution of risk to locations.

            "text": "While random individual variability should have minimal impact on accuracy, population-wide characteristics can have a large impact. We saw this during the 2010 Bulgarian outbreak where 90% of cases were among the Roma population and, despite 6 estimated importations, none were reported 22, 41 . Similarly, the 2013 Dutch outbreak, which was concentrated (>84%) among spatially-isolated orthodox Protestants, produced only 2 reported importations compared with 7 estimated 42 . Both populations have well-documented histories of insufficient vaccination, are typically socially and spatially isolated, and may be less likely to travel internationally or interact with travelers 41-43 . This model is also sensitive to data limitations, particularly with reported measles cases (often underestimated and underreported [44] [45] [46] [47] ) and reported importation cases (required for validation). For an imported case to be reported, the person must either (1) seek medical care, be diagnosed, then be reported by the provider, or (2) be linked to secondary cases who sought care. Even with highly characteristic measles symptomology and essentially no asymptomatic infections, historically, measles reporting has been incomplete, even in the United States [46] [47] [48] [49] . Moreover, foreign visitors might be less likely to seek care, particularly if they depart from the United States early during the infectious period. Importation estimates during a large measles outbreak in Japan during 2007-2008 highlight the challenges of using reported data. While an estimated 4,000-18,000 cases occurred in 2007 50,51 , World Health Organization (WHO) data on reported measles cases include only five cases. This significant underreporting of cases in the country of origin (i.e., Japan) led our model to estimate no importations when ten were reported. In contrast, following national policy changes to require reporting of all measles cases, Japan reported more than 17,000 cases in 2008, from which our model estimated 16 importations. Interestingly, no importations into the United States from Japan were reported during 2008, potentially resulting from changes in vaccination policies, travel advisories, behavior changes, or underreporting of importations 50 . Similarly for Pakistan, reported cases were consistently lower than those found in published sources, contributing to fewer estimated importations than reported 52 .",

First, reducing the risk contributed by resident travelers is essential, accomplished through increased risk awareness 55 and vaccination coverage 56 among travelers (particularly high-risk travelers and those from communities with heterogeneous vaccination coverage 57 ). Second, this work stresses the tremendous value of information to both domestic biosecurity and global disease control. Our world is highly connected, and infectious diseases are global problems that require global cooperation and efforts, including global disease surveillance systems. The better global systems are at collecting and sharing data, the more timely and accurate those data will be, and the more likely it is that they will be useful in preparedness efforts to prevent outbreaks and protect people. Here we focus on measles importations into the United States, but our methods can readily be applied to other countries and other diseases. Virulent pathogens, like arboviruses, zoonotic coronaviruses, Nipah virus, and highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria, continually emerge around the world and, with the right conditions, can rapidly spread across local and global populations.

Because India reported relatively consistent annual measles case counts (median=32,546; IQR=27,440-43,480), the estimated mean annual cases and importations for India should not change substantially were data for 2006-2013 included.

Mean annual estimates were used rather than cumulative estimates as data were not available during part of the study period for several high-risk countries (e.g., data from China were not available for 2006-2010, nor were data available from India for 2006-2013, during which 10 and 50 importations occurred respectively). On average, estimated measles importations predominantly originated from Asia and Europe (60% and 35%, respectively), with only 5% reported from Africa annually. Taken alone, neither case nor travel data fully captures of the risk of measles importation: among the three regions, Asia and Africa reported the majority of measles cases (61% and 27%), with only 12% occurring in Europe. In contrast, 68% of travel volume to the United States originated from Europe, compared to 30% from Asia and only 2% from Africa. Using this model and accounts for reported cases, travel volume, andEstimated risk of importation into the United States, by countryThe five countries with the highest average annual estimated risk of measles case exportation to the United States were India, the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, the Philippines, and China (Table 2,",
