These included osteopathic, naturopathic and chiropractic care, in addition to standard medical care. The U.S. Dept Health & Human Services lists three reasons why, at that time, standard medical care was ineffective. First, physicians mistakenly believed Pfeiffer's bacillus (rather than a virus) was responsible, despite a lack of supportive scientific evidence. Secondly, masks were relied upon despite their ineffectiveness with viruses (masks CAN prevent bacterial spread). Lastly, although few physicians believed in miasmas and imbalances in the humours, their remedies derived from these theories. (U.S. Dept Health & Human Services 2009)",
