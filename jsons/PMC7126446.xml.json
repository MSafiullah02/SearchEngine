            "text": "The complement system plays a crucial role in the elimination of invading pathogens and generation of an optimal host response. It can be activated by a cascade mechanism of the classical pathway (CP), alternative pathway (AP), or the lectin pathway (Carroll and Fischer, 1997). However, a wealth of data has clearly demonstrated that undesired activation of complement is responsible for the initiation, amplification or perpetuation of tissue damage and inflammation in a number of pathological situations (Morgan and Harris, 2003). Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an emerging infectious disease with severe mortality, affected many countries in 2003 and the coronavirus is the etiologic agent (Peiris et al., 2003). In terms of pathogenesis of SARS, viral load in the first phase may in turn result in host inflammatory response during the second phase. The SARS complications are associated with severe inflammatory tissue destruction due to excessive activation of the innate immune system and a notable proportion of the patients progressed to septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction (MODS) in the later phase of viral infection (Li et al., 2003). Considerable clinical and experimental evidence implicated that complement appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of these late post-viral complications, which could even be predicted by increased complement activations (Sahu and Lambris, 2000, Abe, 2006, Sarma et al., 2006). Hence, antiviral agents combined with inhibition of complement cascade reaction may represent an attractive and efficient therapeutic strategy for SARS.",

A multiherb remedy, which contains five ingredients of Herba Houttuyniae, Flos Chrysanthemi Indici, Herba Artemisiae Scopariae, Herba Eupatorii, and Fructus Tsaoko, was recommended for the treatment and prevention of SARS by State Administration of TCM of the People's Republic of China. According to TCM, Herba Houttuyniae, Flos Chrysanthemi Indici, and Herba Artemisiae Scopariae have functions of eliminating evil-heat and detoxification; Herba Eupatorii and Fructus Tsaoko are commonly used for dispersing dampness. Pharmacological experiments showed that these five-ingredient herbs possess direct inhibitory activity against virus, bacteria, and inflammation (Hayashi et al., 1995, Sun et al., 1995, Moon et al., 2004, Xie et al., 2004, Cheng et al., 2005).",

The ethanolic extract of this five-herb remedy was found to possess reproducible activity against the CP and AP of complement system in vitro. Bioactivity-guided fractionation showed that the ethyl acetate-soluble fraction had significant anticomplementary activity. Further chromatographic separation of the active fraction led to the isolation of 15 compounds, including 9 flavonoids, 2 coumarins, 1 alkaloid, 1 monoterpene, 1 organic acid and 1 ketone. Flavonoids were found to show significant inhibitory effect towards the CP and AP of complement system. In addition, high performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detector and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (HPLC\u2013DAD\u2013ESI-MS) was applied to identify and track these compounds in the ingredient herbs. The isolation and anticomplementary activity of these compounds and the HPLC\u2013DAD\u2013ESI-MS analysis are reported herein.",

The bioactivity-guided fractionation indicated that the petroleum ether fraction resulted in haemolysis of the sheep and rabbit erythrocytes at higher concentrations of 1.38 and 0.83 mg/mL, respectively. According to the results of lysis control without serum, both the ethanolic extract and the petroleum ether fraction definitely induced lysis when the doses for the assay were exceedingly large. The EtOAc and n-BuOH fractions inhibited both the CP and AP of complement system in a dose-dependent manner. The EtOAc fraction showed a more pronounced complement inhibition than the n-BuOH fraction, as measured by the diminished haemolysis of sensitized erythrocytes in the presence of complement factors (Fig. 1\n, Table 1). Thus, it was concluded that the main anticomplementary principles were enriched in the EtOAc fraction.

The analysis confirmed the presence of compounds 1\u20133, 6, 8, 10\u201315 in Herba Houttuyniae with different contents. Compounds 1, 3, 8, 10\u201313, and 15 were detected in Flos Chrysanthemi Indici and compounds 1, 4, 5, 6, 9\u201313, and 15 were found in Herba Artemisiae Scopariae. Meanwhile, compounds 4, 7, and compounds 1, 3, 4, 8, 13, and 15 could be detected in Herba Eupatorii and Fructus Tsaoko, respectively (Table 3\n). According to the literatures (Haruna et al., 1986, Chu et al., 2004, Xie et al., 2004, Jiang and Gao, 2005, Xu et al., 2006), a plenty of flavonoids were present in Herba Houttuyniae, Flos Chrysanthemi Indici, and Herba Artemisiae Scopariae while sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes were distributed in Herba Eupatorii, which were in good agreement with the results of HPLC\u2013DAD-MS analysis. Although there were few reports on flavonoids obtained from Fructus Tsaoko, several flavonoids were detected in the methanolic extract of Fructus Tsaoko with MS detector in the SIM mode in our investigation. Therefore, further isolation and NMR elucidation would be very helpful to confirm the presence of these flavonoids in Fructus Tsaoko.",
