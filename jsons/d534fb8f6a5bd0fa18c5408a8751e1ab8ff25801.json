However, the mechanism by which VCP participates in the EVA71 life cycle remains unclear. Using chemical inhibitor, RNA interference and dominant negative mutant, we confirmed that the VCP and its ATPase activity were critical for EVA71 infection. To identify the factors downstream of VCP in enterovirus infection, 31 known VCP-cofactors were screened in the siRNA knockdown experiments. The results showed that UFD1 (ubiquitin recognition factor in ER associated degradation 1), but not NPL4 (NPL4 homolog, ubiquitin recognition factor), played critical roles in infections by EVA71. UFD1 knockdown suppressed the activity of EVA71 pseudovirus (causing single round infection) while it did not affect the viral replication in replicon RNA transfection assays. In addition, knockdown of VCP and UFD1 reduced viral infections by multiple human Enterovirus A serotypes. Mechanistically, we found that knockdown of UFD1 significantly decreased the binding and the subsequent entry of EVA71 to host cells through modulating the levels of nucleolin protein, a coreceptor of EVA71. Together, these data reveal novel roles of VCP and its cofactor UFD1 in the virus entry by EVA71. 3A-3D) . The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase https://doi.",

The Enterovirus genus consists of 12 species, including Enterovirus A (Enterovirus A71, Coxsackievirus A6, A10, A16 etc.), B (Coxsackievirus B3, CVB3 etc.), C (Poliovirus, etc.), D (Enterovirus D68 etc.) species and Rhinovirus A, B, C etc. (Walker et al., 2019) . Enterovirus A71 (EVA71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) are the major causative pathogen of hand, food and mouth disease (HFMD). Recently, HFMD associated with Coxsackievirus A6 and A10 (CVA6 and CVA10) also emerged (Aswathyraj et al., 2016) . In China, EVA71 caused a severe HFMD outbreak in 2008, and HFMD has since become epidemic (Zhang et al., 2010) . No effective therapy is currently available for HFMD and more studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of enterovirus infection and HFMD pathogenesis.",

The human scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2) was found to be the exclusive receptor to induce uncoating of EVA71 in vitro (Yamayoshi et al., 2009) . SCARB2 binds EVA71 on the southern rim of the canyon (Zhou et al., 2019) and expelles the pocket factor from the EVA71 virion, hence destabilizing the capsid and triggering the uncoating process (Dang et al., 2014) . In addition, other host factors on the cell surface are reported to facilitate EVA71 entry, such as Annexin A2, fibronectin, vimentin and nucleolin (Du et al., 2014; He et al., 2018; Su et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2011) .

Various host RNA-binding proteins are also involved in viral genome replication, including poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2), polyadenylate-binding protein 1 (PABP1) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC) (Baggen et al., 2018; Owino and Chu, 2019) .

Valosin-containing protein (VCP), a hexameric type II AAA ATPase, participates in various cellular activities including protein homeostasis, DNA replication and repair and autophagy (Meyer and Weihl, 2014) . VCP has been found to play roles in replication of poliovirus and Hepatitis C virus (Arita et al., 2012; Yi et al., 2016) , and originally identified as host factor of Drosophila C virus (Cherry et al., 2006) . Recently, VCP was identified to be required in EVA71 replication (Wu et al., 2016) and VCP co-exists with the viral protein and other known replication-related molecules in EVA71-induced ROs (Wang et al., 2017) . However, the precise mechanism of VCP involved in EVA71 life cycle remains elusive.",

This enzyme hydrolyzes ATP and utilizes the energy to extract protein subunit or disassemble protein complexes from protein assemblies, chromatin and membranes (DeLaBarre and Brunger, 2003) . The activity of VCP is tightly controlled by various regulatory cofactors, which either associate with the N-terminal domain or interact with the C-terminus via distinct binding motifs and target VCP to specific cellular pathways (Hanzelmann and Schindelin, 2017) . Based on their functions, cofactors are divided into three major classes: (i) Substrate-recruiting cofactors like UBA-UBX proteins and UFD1-NPL4 which bring substrates to VCP; (ii) Substrate processing cofactors like ubiquitin (E3) ligases, deubiquitinases (DUBs) and peptide N-glycanase (PNGase); (iii) Regulatory cofactors like UBX proteins UBXD4 and ASPL as well as SVIP (Hanzelmann and Schindelin, 2017) . VCP cofactors interact with VCP via several conserved binding motifs (Buchberger et al., 2015) . Majority of cofactors interact with the VCP N-terminal domain either via the ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX)/UBX-like (UBXL) domain or three linear binding motifs, called VCP-interacting motif (VIM), VBM (VCP-binding motif), and SHP (BS1, binding segment), whereas other cofactors bind to VCP via their PNGase/UBA or UBX containing proteins (PUB) or PLAP, Ufd3p, and Lub1p (PUL) domain to the C-terminal tail of VCP.",

Knockdown of UFD1 significantly reduced the binding of EVA71 to host cells, but had no effect on viral RNA replication. Moreover, UFD1 regulates the viral co-receptor nucleolin expression since knockdown of UFD1 significantly reduces the expression of nucleolin, leading to decreased binding of EVA71 to host cells. Thus, our study reveals novel mechanisms of VCP and its cofactors to facilitate enterovirus infection.",

NMS-873 treatment reduced viral replication in a dose-dependent manner, evidenced by decreased levels of viral capsid protein VP-1 ( Fig. 1a and b) with only marginal loss (< 20 %) of cell viability at the highest dosage (Fig. 1b) . The inhibitory effects of NMS-873 were also verified by plaque assay to monitor the virion production and by western blotting to monitor the expression level of viral proteins. (Fig. 1c and d) To further confirm the requirement of VCP in EVA71 infection, we performed shRNA-medicated knockdown of VCP. There were reduced viral replication, evidenced by reduction of the intracellular VP-1 protein (Fig. 1e ) and viral production (Fig. 1f) in the VCP-knockdown cells. Western blot showed that transfection of shVCP decreased the expression of VCP, compared with shNC. Moreover, knockdown of VCP dramatically reduced EVA71 infection, as assessed by flow cytometry and plaque assay ( Fig. 1e and f) . These data indicate a critical role of VCP in EVA71 infection.",

Double mutation (E305Q/E578Q) of these two domains completely abolishes ATPase activity, as a dominant negative mutant (Yi et al., 2016) . To determine whether the ATPase activity of VCP is required for EVA71 replication, we performed a rescue experiment by co-transfection of shRNA against VCP and overexpression of shRNA-resistant VCP (VCP-es) or dominant negative mutant VCP (VCP-es-DN). As shown in Fig. 2a and b, VCP-es could restore EVA71 infection, and VCP-es-DN synergistically reduced EVA71 infection, demonstrating that ATPase activity of VCP is critical for the infection. Alveolar soft part sarcoma locus (ASPL), a cofactor of VCP with high-affinity, is reported to promote VCP hexamer disassembly and disrupt the D2 ATPase activity of VCP (Arumughan et al., 2016) . Its extended UBX domain-containing fragment (residues 313-553, termed ASPL-C), is critical for the interaction with VCP, while its mutant (two Proline amino acids of residues 437-438 were replaced by two Alanine amino acids, termed ASPL-C PP 437-438 AA) loses the binding for VCP A. RD cells were pretreated with increasing concentrations of VCP inhibitor -NMS 873 for 1 h. Then EVA71 was added at an MOI of 1 for 6 h. The infected cells were processed for flow cytometry. The typical VP-1 expression data was shown. B. The bar charts represented the EVA71 infectivity determined by the percentage of VP-1 positive cells and were shown (means \u00b1 SD, n = 3).

Therefore, we constructed the ASPL-C and ASPL-C PP 437-438 AA to further assess the necessity of VCP's enzymatic activity. Our results showed that the overexpression of ASPL-C, which disrupts VCP activity, could dramatically reduce EVA71 infection; while the overexpression of mutant PP 437-438 AA, which did not bind VCP, had little effect on the EVA71 infection ( Fig. 2c and d) .",

            "text": "VCP itself barely exhibits substrate specificity. It engages a large number of cofactors for its diverse functions (Buchberger et al., 2015) . To identify which cofactors of VCP are involved in EVA71 infection, we screened with siRNAs targeting 31 reported VCP-interacting proteins. Knockdown of majority of these cofactors had marginal effect on EVA71 infection, despite of effective knockdown of the targeted genes (Fig. 3a) . However, the siRNAs against UBXN6, UFD1 and SPRTN significantly reduced the viral infectivity (Fig. 3b) . Since UFD1 interference showed the most consistent and the largest suppressing effect, we subsequently focused on the role of UFD1 in virus infection. To exclude the off-target effects of siRNA against UFD1, we examined three siRNA oligosaccharides and two previously reported oligosaccharides showing strong suppressing effects individually. The data showed that the EVA71 infectivity negatively correlated with the remaining UFD1 levels in infected RD cells, confirming a requirement of UFD1 for efficient viral infection ( Fig. 3c and d) . UFD1 is known to be a partner of NPL4 in the VCP machinery to function in various protein quality control processes, for example, facilitating the translocation of misfolded protein from ER to the cytosol during the ER associated degradation (Ye et al., 2003) . However, knockdown of NPL4 did not affect EVA71 infection in our screening and the subsequent confirmatory experiments (Fig. 3e ). In conclusion, we found that knockdown of VCP and UFD1 but not NPL4 could significantly reduce EVA71 infection, indicating a likely novel working mechanism of VCP-UFD1 in facilitating EVA71 infection without NPL4.",

Of the 31 cofactors, UFD1 was identified as a crucial factor for EVA71 infection. UFD1 and its partner NPL4 bind to VCP and form protein complexes involved in various protein-quality control processes, such as ERAD (Nowis et al., 2006) . We hypothesized the enterovirus infection may not rely on these conventional roles of VCP and UFD1. Indeed, we found that knockdown of VCP, UFD1 and NPL4 prevented the degradation of TCR\u03b1 by ERAD. However, knockdown of NPL4 failed to affect EVA71 infection, so the role of UFD1 and VCP in EVA71 infection is independent of NPL4 or ERAD. Furthermore, we also found similar roles of VCP and UFD1 in facilitating infection of other enteroviruses, such as CVA16, CAV6 and CVA10, whereas knockdown of NPL4 did not affect viral infections.

We assumed that UFD1 affect the viral entry indirectly since UFD1 is localized in cytosol and cell nucleus. Interestingly, we found that VCP and UFD1 knockdown reduced nucleolin levels and inhibited EVA71 infection. These data indicate that UFD1 likely acts as an upstream regulator for nucleolin, a coreceptor for EVA71. We further showed the matching effects of UFD1 and nucleolin knockdown in infections by different Enterovirus species. While knockdown of either UFD1 or nucleolin inhibited Enterovirus A (EVA71) infections, it failed to affect both Enterovirus B (CVB3) and Enterovirus C (poliovirus) infections.

So far, the underlying mechanisms and the involved co-factors in these processes are still elusive. In the screening of cofactors, we identified that UBXN6 and SPRTN knockdown also had inhibitory effects on EVA71 infection. It has been reported that SPRTN is a regulator of UV-induced DNA damage response and promote ubiquitination of PCNA and synthesis of translesion DNA synthesis (Machida et al., 2012) . UBXN6 is an ATP-driven separating enzyme which can remove misfolded proteins through ERAD pathway and promotes macrophage phagocytosis to remove damaged lysosomes (Nagahama et al., 2009; Papadopoulos et al., 2017; Trusch et al., 2015) . We attempt to think that when viral RNA is released in the infected cell, VCP may collaborate with SPRTN or other unidentified factors to protect viral RNA from host sensing and degradation, thus promoting the replication and translation of viral RNA. Whereas VCP may recruit UBXN6 or other unknown factors, to participate in the ROs formation by dealing with the mis-assembled and misfolded proteins. These assumptions require future experimental validations and the results will lead to more insights of the versatile roles of VCP and its cofactors during viral infections.",
