Since then, our understanding of how ubiquitin is fundamental to maintain cell homeostasis has exponentially increased. It has become clear that the ubiquitin system is far more than just a system to control protein homeostasis through protein degradation and that it is fundamental for the control of signalling pathways such as DNA repair, receptor trafficking to the plasma membrane and immune signalling 1, 2. The discovery of a wide variety of polyubiquitin chains, including phosphorylated ubiquitin and how each of these controls different protein fates, has uncovered the great complexity of this system.",

The initiation of inflammation leads to the activation of the innate immune response, as a first line of defence, followed by the adaptive immune response, with the ultimate goal of removing the threat, promoting tissue repair and restoring health. Although inflammation is a beneficial process in life, its deregulation can lead to chronic inflammation that results in the initiation and progression of disease 2. It is therefore necessary that initiation and progression of the inflammatory response are tightly regulated at different levels, and this is achieved amongst other things through PTMs such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination 3.",

Inflammasomes form when cells such as macrophages encounter danger signals, either derived from tissue damage, such as extracellular ATP, or infection, such as bacterial toxins. Assembly of these complexes leads to the activation of the protease caspase\u20101 which triggers the processing and release of the active forms of the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018, and a process of cell death called pyroptosis 4. The ability to sense and respond to danger appropriately is critical for maintaining immune homeostasis. Dysregulation of inflammasomes contributes to the progression of many chronic diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and rheumatoid arthritis; hence, it is critical that inflammasome activation is tightly regulated 4.",

In this case, the first ubiquitin serves as the acceptor of additional ubiquitins that conjugate to each other at any one of their lysine residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63 or methionine 1 (M1, linear chains)) 5 (Fig. 1Bi,ii). In addition to these eight different types of polyubiquitin chains (poly\u2010Ub), ubiquitin (Ub) can also form hybrid polyubiquitin chains, where additional ubiquitins conjugate to each other through any of their different K residues (Fig. 1Biii). It is also worth noting that noncanonical ubiquitination of residues other than lysine, such as serine or threonine, can also occur, although this type of ubiquitination is not yet well understood 8.

One major way of achieving this is by controlling NLRP3 levels by the proteasome or autophagy degradation pathways. TRIM31 has been shown to directly bind to NLRP3, inducing K48 poly\u2010Ub that leads to proteasomal degradation of the NLRP3 26. The E3 ligase SCF\u2010FBXL2 also contributes to NLRP3 regulation 27. SCF\u2010FBXL2 ubiquitinates NLRP3 in the resting state and hence contributes to its degradation by the proteasome. However, upon LPS sensing (signal 1), the levels of the E3 ligase FBXO3 that ubiquitinates FBXL2 and targets it to proteasomal degradation increase. This consequently reduces FBXL2 levels leading to an increase in NLRP3 expression and therefore increased inflammasome activation. Although no direct link to a particular E3 has been yet been established, it has been shown that cigarette smoke induces NLRP3 ubiquitination leading to its proteasomal degradation 28. Similarly, Filardy et al.\n29 showed that murine colonic macrophages express much lower levels of NLRP3 protein compared to bone marrow\u2010derived macrophages (BMDM), despite levels of mRNA being much higher. This is due to basal NLRP3 levels being controlled by the proteasome since treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 increased NLRP3 expression to levels equivalent to those seen in BMDMs. They also showed that blocking IL\u201010R in these macrophages restored NLRP3 levels, implying that IL\u201010 plays a role in such proteasomal control of NLRP3 inflammasome. This would provide a mechanism for other studies showing that IL\u201010 negatively regulates the NLRP3 inflammasome 30.",

The authors proposed that dopamine controls HGMB1 release via HIF1\u03b1\u2010dependent anaerobic glycolysis and that this also controls NLRP3 levels, and its consequent activation, through proteasomal degradation 31. The effect of dopamine on NLRP3\u2010mediated degradation has been previously reported. Dopamine through the dopamine D1 receptor (D1DR) leads to the production of cAMP, which in turn binds NLRP3 promoting MARCH7\u2010mediated K48 ubiquitination and its degradation by autophagy 32.

Upon sensing of the activating signal (signal 2; i.e. ATP or the bacterial toxin nigericin), Cullin1 dissociates from NLRP3 allowing it to form an active inflammasome 35.

Similarly, it has been shown that far\u2010infrared, used as treatment to ameliorate burn wound progression, leads to TRAF6\u2010mediated ASC polyubiquitination and its degradation by autophagy in macrophages 42, implying that TRAF6 plays different roles on inflammasome activation depending on the activating stimuli and cell type. Another report has shown that treatment with myricetin, a plant\u2010derived flavonoid, inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome. This compound reduces ASC ubiquitination and increases NLRP3 ubiquitination; however, whether this leads to degradation of one of them or prevents nontranslational priming needs to be further investigated 43.

For instance, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ORF3a protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome by promoting TRAF3\u2010dependent ubiquitination of ASC 44. Similarly, K63 ubiquitination of ASC also occurs upon MAVS\u2010mediated recruitment of TRAF3 upon vesicular stomatitis virus infection 45.",

This work suggested that BRCC3 directly interacted with NLRP3, and its presence was required for appropriate NLRP3 inflammasome formation. Recently, Ren et al.\n55 showed that ABRO1, another component of BRISC, is required for optimal NLRP3 activation and that ABRO1\u2010deficient mice have impaired NLRP3 inflammasome responses. ABRO1 interacts with NLRP3 and promotes its deubiquitination allowing the formation of an active inflammasome complex. ABRO1 acts as a scaffold for the interaction of NLRP3 with BRCC3 and synergizes with BRCC3 to promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation by regulating NLRP3 deubiquitination. Furthermore, ABRO1 can deubiquitinate NLRP3 holding one of the mutations (A350V) that lead to its autoactivation and to Muckle\u2013Wells syndrome, one the autoinflammatory CAPS (cryopirin\u2010associated periodic syndromes) 56.

Similarly, we do not understand how ubiquitin contributes to the activation of the noncanonical or alternative NLRP3 activation pathways.",

It is then possible that other members of the ubiquitin system are also regulated by inflammasome activation, modulating not only inflammasome activity but a wider aspect of the inflammatory response. For instance, the DUBs USP10 and VCIP135 have been identified as caspase\u20101 substrates, suggesting that caspase\u20101 might have additional roles as a regulator of the ubiquitin system during inflammatory episodes 83.",

We need to better understand how E1\u2010E2\u2010E3 and DUBs are regulated, especially when present in protein complexes whose composition can vary depending on their location in the cell, cell type or in response to different cellular challenges, for example in disease or during ageing 92.

Finally, there are still many DUBs whose function is unknown and new ones that have just been discovered.

Addition of ubiquitin to a substrate protein is mediated by an E1 ubiquitin\u2010activating enzyme which forms a thioester bond with ubiquitin.

Substrates proteins can be (i) by just one ubiquitin either just once or repeatedly in the same protein at different sites (monoubiquitination); (ii) at the same site repeatedly (polyubiquitination). Homogeneous polyubiquitination occurs when the first ubiquitin serves as the acceptor of additional ubiquitins that are conjugated to each other at the very same lysine residue each time (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, K63 or M1).

Inflammasome needs a priming signal (signal 1) such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that triggers the NF\u2010\u0138B pathway leading to an increase in the production of proIL\u20101\u03b2 and NLRP3. A second signal, named activation signal (signal 2), is triggered after the recognition of MAMPs and DAMPs through specific receptors such as the purinergic receptor P2X7 that sense extracellular ATP, membrane disruption by bacterial toxins or lysosomal uptake of particulate matter such as monosodium urate crystals. This activating signal triggers a disruption of cell homeostasis that results in increased potassium efflux. This potassium efflux is sensed by the cytosolic receptor NLRP3 that in turn oligomerizes and forms the active complex of the inflammasome after recruitment of ASC and caspase\u20101. The active inflammasome will cleave procaspase\u20101 generating active caspase\u20101 which will lead to the cleavage and the release of the pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines IL\u20101\u03b2 and IL\u201018. Caspase\u20101 will also cleave gasdermin\u2010D and that will result in the creation of pores in the membrane. These pores are suggested to be one mechanism of release for IL\u201018 and IL\u20101\u03b2. The gasdermin\u2010D pore also contributes to pro\u2010inflammatory cell death known as pyroptosis.",

(i) E3 ligases such as FBXL2, PARKIN, TRIM31 or MARCH7 have been identified as negative regulators of the inflammasome by controlling its protein levels by either proteasome or autophagy pathways. Upon sensing inflammasome\u2010priming signals (signal 1), ARIH2 and Cullin1 bind and ubiquitinate NLRP3 to maintain it in an inactive state, which prevents its assembly and inflammasome activation. Upon sensing activating signals (signal 2), they dissociate from NLRP3 reducing its ubiquitination and allowing for the formation of an active inflammasome. The deubiquitinase A20 also contributes to a negative regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. (ii). On the contrary, ubiquitination of NLRP3 by Pellino2, TRAF6 and TRIM33 upon signal 1 poises the NLRP3 into an active estate that facilitates its activation by signal 2. Upon sensing of these activating signals, deubiquitinases such as BRCC3/ABRO1, USP7, USP47 or UCHL5 contribute to inflammasome activation, although the exact mechanisms by which they do this are not completely understood.",
