            "text": "Common colds caused by viral respiratory infections are the most frequent acute respiratory illness in humans. They can be caused by a variety of different viruses including coronaviruses, parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial viruses but infection with rhinoviruses (HRV) of the Picornaviridae family is predominant [1]. The antiviral response depends on the rapid production of interferons (IFNs), which are classified as type 1 IFNs (IFN\u03b1/\u03b2) and type 2 IFN (IFN\u03b3) based on the receptor complex used for signalling as well as on their sequence homology [2], [3]. Almost every nucleated cell produces IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 when infected by a virus, whereas IFN\u03b3 is mainly produced by T cells and NK cells. IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 mount robust host responses against viruses by inducing a wide variety of antiviral proteins including ribonucleases that digest viral double stranded RNA, and the antiviral protein kinase PKR which induces apoptosis. Inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) is also an important component of the innate immune response [4], [5], as it exerts direct antiviral activity by nitrolysating key thiol residues in viral proteases.",

In vitro infection of airway epithelial cells with rhinovirus induces the production of a wide range of antiviral molecules including INF\u03b2 [6], [7], \u03b2-defensins [8], [9] as well as NOS2 [10], or proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines that attract and activate cells of the immune system, including CXCL8, CXCL5, CXCL10, CCL5 and IL-6 [11]\u2013[13]. During HRV infections in vivo, levels of epithelial NOS2 induction correlate with levels of exhaled nitric oxide (NO), and subjects with the highest levels of exhaled NO clear the virus more rapidly and have fewer symptoms [14]. CXCL8 and IL-6 are present in nasal secretions and sputum of HRV-infected individuals [15]\u2013[20].",

This might be due to the lack of type 1 IFNs and NO responses, two systems known to block the spread of virus infection. Indeed, we did not observe induction of IFN\u03b2 and NOS2 mRNA expression in HNEC, and did not detect IFN\u03b2 protein and NO in the extracellular media 40 h after HRV14 infection in the absence of activated T cells. Our inability to detect up-regulation of the genes important in antiviral defense cannot be ascribed to insufficient infection of HNEC since the viral dose used in our study did allow productive infection of HNEC. Of note, this viral dose is 5 times higher than that usually employed in experimental inoculation studies, reported to be effective in inducing significant cold symptoms[20], [24], [25]. Hence our observation in nasal epithelial cells differ from those previously reported for bronchial epithelial cells [27]. This may be related to the degree of infection, the cell's origin (upper or lower airways) and/or differentiation status. Of note, highly polarized cells like those used in our study were reported to be much less susceptible to virus infection [28]. In addition, no significant induction of the neutrophil attractant CXCL8 and the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 was observed in our cells following HRV14 challenge, which is in accordance with data obtained with fully differentiated epithelial cells grown with an air-liquid interface [28], but in contrast with those obtained with undifferentiated tracheal/bronchial primary epithelial cells or cell lines grown as submerged monolayers [11]\u2013[13]. We did observe a consistent and significant induction of mRNA and secreted protein of CXCL10, a potent chemo-attractant for T cells. This observation supports the current opinion that epithelial cells are the primary source of CXCL10 during HRV infection. It has been reported that CXCL10 production increased in airway epithelium after in vivo and in vitro HRV infection [6], [29]\u2013[31], in airway secretions during symptomatic in vivo HRV infections, and in serum of asthmatic patients during virus-induced exacerbations [32]. Taken altogether, our results show that apart from CXCL10, HRV infection by itself did not induce significant antiviral and inflammatory responses in fully differentiated airway epithelial cells with intact tight junctions.",

The effect was particularly strong for CXCL10, thousands times greater than that induced by HRV14. Epithelial CXCL10 induction is mediated by T cells derived soluble factors because activated T cells were not in direct contact with HNEC in our co-cultures. Our data obtained with neutralizing antibodies, T cell clones secreting different IFN\u03b3 and TNF amounts, and increasing numbers of T cells, clearly indicate that IFN\u03b3 and TNF were the main inducers of epithelial CXCL10. Our observation that epithelial CXCL10 production attained a plateau at high IFN\u03b3 and TNF concentrations points to saturation of IFN\u03b3/TNF receptors. However, recombinant IFN\u03b3 and TNF added as a single bolus at concentrations (50 ng/ml) equivalent or greater than those secreted by high numbers of T cells induced only a modest increase in epithelial CXCL10 mRNA expression. This might be due to the fact that exogenously added cytokines are short-lived in the culture media while in co-cultures, cytokines are continuously produced by activated T cells. Of note, exogenous TNF added alone had no effect (data not shown) implicating that in co-cultures the stimulating effect of TNF on epithelial CXCL10 might be mediated through INF\u03b3 induced by TNF. Taken altogether these data highlight the importance of continuous interactions between immune and epithelial cells resulting in uninterrupted production of cytokines to maintain transduction signals for host responses. The observed additive effects of IFN\u03b3 and TNF on CXCL10 suggest that more than one signaling pathway was involved, similar to signaling in human monocytes [33] and airway smooth muscle cells [34]. By contrast, the effects of IFN\u03b3 and TNF on NOS2 are not additive, suggesting that they might act on similar transduction pathways. Furthermore, IFN\u03b3 and TNF were only partially effective in inducing epithelial NOS2, indicating that other soluble factors were required.",

As such, this experimental system is most likely representative of severe in vivo infection conditions with immune cells infiltrating the mucosa.

It is expectable that a mild viral infection of the mucosal epithelium in vivo promotes further airway inflammation by triggering epithelial CXCL10 production, allowing accumulation of activated T lymphocytes which in turn enhance epithelial chemokines and cytokines production. On the other hand, activated T cells recruited to the site of infection help epithelial cells to clear viruses through production of IFN\u03b3 and TNF, and induction of epithelial NOS2 expression. Consequently, epithelial cells are important effector cells in immune response and activated T lymphocytes are a major player in HRV-induced airway inflammation by linking innate and adaptive immunity.",
