COVID-19\nfirst emerged in the city of Wuhan (China) at the end of 2019 but now has turned into a global\npandemic reported in all continents just after a few short months. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be\nhighly contagious and spreads mainly from human to human through respiratory droplets from\ncoughing and sneezing of the infected persons as well as by fomites. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a\nfamily of viruses named coronaviruses for the crownlike spikes on their surface that can\ninfect bats, birds, pigs, cows, and other mammals and mutate easily to transfer from animals\nto humans.1 Before the COVID-19 outbreak, six strains of such virus already\nhave been identified as human pathogens known to cause viral respiratory illness. However, not\nall of them are highly pathogenic. For examples, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and\nHCoV-HKU1 merely cause a common cold. In contrast, both the severe acute respiratory syndrome\ncoronavirus (SARS-CoV)2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus\n(MERS-CoV)3 have caused large-scale outbreaks during the past two decades\nwith significant case-fatality rates (9.6% for SARS and 34% for MERS). As for COVID-19, its\ncase-fatality rate remains uncertain given the pandemic is still in its early stages.",

For example, maturation of 12 nonstructural proteins\n(Nsp4\u2013Nsp16), including critical proteins like the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp,\nNsp12) and helicase (Nsp13), requires the cleavage through the Mpro.

Irreversible\ninhibitors like N3 are efficacious and have been proven to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus in\nin vitro viral proliferation models with moderate efficacy (EC50\n= 4\u20135 \u03bcM).5 However, development of these tool drugs into an\napproved drug could take years to accomplish. In an BioRxiv preprint,6 a\nfew marketed drug such as ebselen, disulfiram, tideglusib, and carmofur have exhibited\nEC50 values of 0.67 \u03bcM, 9.35 \u03bcM, 1.55 \u03bcM, and 1.82 \u03bcM\nrespectively with an in vitro enzymatic assay, which translate to an\nEC50 of 4.6 \u03bcM in antiviral activity for ebselen (best in class), compared\nto an EC50 of 16.77 \u03bcM for N3.5 These experiments\nvalidated that Mpro could be a viable antiviral target, albeit additional efforts are needed\nto search for more potent and specific antiviral drugs with a better safety margin than\nebselen that is an (irreversible) inhibitor for the Mpro and many other enzymes in a broad\nspectrum of tissues with significant cellular toxicity.7 Motivated by the\nfact that Mpro can be inhibited by multiple drug-like ligands, we speculated that a range of\ndrug molecules may efficaciously interact with the Mpro pocket. Given the urgency, we used\nin silico methods to explore a set of 19 marketed drugs that have exhibited\na great deal of promise in clinics, aiming to identify the potential high-potential ones for\nthe Mpro inhibition and discover a common binding mechanism for these drug molecules inside\nthe Mpro\u2019s pocket.",

Thus, we carried out two independent MD simulations (Sim-1 and\nSim-2) for nelfinavir in Mpro\u2019s pocket (Figure 6a) to corroborate our prediction. From the two independent MD simulations, we found\nthat the nelfinavir molecule was stably bound inside the Mpro\u2019s pocket, as shown by the\noverlapped COMs of nelfinavir (Figure 6b for Sim-1\nand Figure S2 for Sim-2). The stability was contributed by the internal hydrogen\nbond between the -NH and -C=O groups (Figure 6c), two\nhydrogen bonds between nelfinavir and residues His163 and Gln189 in Mpro (Figure 6c), and the significant amount of hydrophobic interactions\nbetween nelfinavir and Mpro. Overall, the entire molecule was nicely fit inside the\nMpro\u2019s pocket, with its benzene group located at the \u201canchor\u201d site (Figure 6d). We further highlight the stable binding of\nnelfinavir with snapshots at simulation times of 0, 66, 144, and 177 ns (Figure 6e,f) and with a movie in the Supporting Information showing the simulation trajectory (Sim-1). Therefore, the\npredicted pose of nelfinavir in the Mpro\u2019s pocket, from docking, was confirmed by MD\nsimulatons. Compared with entecavir, nelfinavir almost occupies the whole Mpro\u2019s pocket\nand has a much larger contact area (\u223c4.5 nm2) with the Mpro, as shown in the\ntwo independent MD simulations (Sim-1 and Sim-2) in Figure 6i.",

We found that the docking affinity scores of several molecules (such as nelfinavir\nand entecavir) are very close to those of the ligands found experimentally (N3 and O6K), and\ntheir binding stabilities with the Mpro were verified in MD simulations. Indeed, during the\nreview of this work, a preprint published in bioRxiv shows that experimentally nelfinavir can\nstrongly inhibit the Mpro in vitro.46 However, we note\nthat there are potential limitations of our methods, such as the approximated scoring\nfunctions in the docking method and classic force fields in the MD method. Therefore, the rank\norder provided in Figure 4t is by no means intended\nto promote certain drug molecules. Instead, by examining almost 100 different poses of each\ndocked molecule, we realized the importance of the \u201canchor\u201d site in the Mpro\npocket. Besides the hint from docking studies, we confirmed in MD simulation that by occupying\nthe \u201canchor\u201d site, a ligand can reside inside the Mpro pocket more stably via\nhydrophobic interactions. More importantly, the binding mechanism revealed in this work is\nsupported by evidence observed in experimental studies, including the recently published one\n(during the review of this work) showing the bindings of compounds 11a and\n11b with a hydrophobic group in the \u201canchor\u201d site.47 Therefore, we conclude that a drug molecule can be more potent with a\nhydrophobic bulky group occupying the \u201canchor\u201d site. Given the bottleneck in the\ncurrent testing capacity and throughput of the Mpro protease assay,we expect that these\nin silico results and predictions could help the wet-lab groups to\nprioritize their testing and shed light on the future discovery of highly potent inhibitors\ntargeting the SARS-CoV-2\u2019s Mpro.",
