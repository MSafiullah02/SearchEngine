They are characterised by complex causes, consequences and potential solutions that critically limit the effectiveness of scientific and technocratic approaches to governance (CDC 2010; Morens and Fauci 2012). EID crises create major issues for distribution of scarce resources, access to health services and global health security. Historically, EIDs have been managed in overlapping, uncoordinated, disciplinary silos (Zinsstag et al. 2006). However, since they are largely driven by human behaviours and human structures in the context of human\u2013animal interactions, the effectiveness of traditional sectoral approaches has been limited.",

The OH literature emphasises the benefits (Zinsstag et al. 2006; Zinsstag et al. 2012; Allen-Scott et al. 2015), but there has been little attempt to identify and assess barriers to and enablers of cross-sectoral collaboration (Hueston et al. 2013; Coker et al. 2011; Okello et al. 2015; Ezenwa et al. 2015).

Moreover, despite almost two decades of interdisciplinary advocacy by international agencies and national governments, OH still means different things to different people (Text Box  1) (Gibbs 2014). It remains an \u2018umbrella concept\u2019 for a variety of expert perspectives and disciplinary agendas. This raises concerns about the capacity and willingness of different professional groups to collaborate (Lee and Brumme 2013; Okello et al. 2014; Chien 2013) and the extent to which various sectoral priorities can be aligned, during EID response planning (St\u00e4rk et al. 2015; Brookes et al. 2015; H\u00e4sler et al. 2012).\n",

Except for early discussions about OH definitions (Round [R] 2/Q1), consensus \u2018cut offs\u2019 (i.e. fixed levels of agreement) were not employed to limit the choices available to survey participants. Otherwise, participants were asked to judge and respond to the levels of consensus/disagreement that emerged from each round to provide greater insight into the operational relevance of OH. Participants who completed each round were invited to participate in the next, but were free to withdraw at any time. We used an online survey platform [Limesurvey].",
