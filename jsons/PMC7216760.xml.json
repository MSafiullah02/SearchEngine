It has\none of the largest genomes among all RNA viruses, comprising approximately 30 kilobases (kb)\n(NC_045512.2). SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 belong to the same Coronaviridae\nfamily that also includes the highly fatal Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS)\nthat appeared in 2012.7 SARS-CoV-2 enters cells through the interaction\nof its surface Spike protein with the host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2\n(ACE2).8 Subsequent proteolytic cleavage by the host serine protease\nTMPRSS2 or perhaps other proteases allows subsequent cell entry by endocytosis.8 Upon membrane fusion and endocytosis, the viral nucleocapsid with its genome\npayload is released into the cytoplasm of the infected cell. Following its release into the\nhost cell, the virus usurps portions of the endoplasmic reticulum to form numerous double\nmembrane vesicles.9 These vesicles are perfect sanctuaries to protect the\nviral genome and allow an efficient replication process to occur through a macromolecule\ncomplex called the replication\u2013transcription complex (RTC).10 The\nviral genome is subsequently translated into viral polyproteins using the host cell protein\ntranslation machinery, which are then cleaved into structural and nonstructural viral\nproteins by two viral proteases, Mpro and PLpro.11\nThis step is followed by the assembly of viral particles (virions) in the endoplasmic\nreticulum/golgi compartment.12 The packaged virions are then transported\nto the cell surface, are released from the cells through exocytosis, and proceed to infect\nother cells.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 likely binds to epithelial cells in the nasal cavity during the asymptomatic\nstate of the disease (initial 1\u20132 days of infection) where there might be some local\npropagation of the virus but with a limited innate immune response. Within the next few days\nthe infection starts in the upper airway and during this stage the infection can be detected\nby nasal swabs or sputum as well as early markers of the innate immune response. About 80%\nof infected patients show mild symptoms that are mostly restricted to the upper and\nconducting airways.13 However, about 20% of infected patients will\nprogress to develop a lower respiratory tract infection leading to hypoxia, and lung damage.\nThese patients are liable to succumb to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is\nfrequently fatal. Patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes\nmellitus, hypertension, chronic lung disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, and obesity\n(body mass index \u226530) and ARDS are at increased risk of death.14\nThe available data indicate that the viral infection can produce an excessive immune\nreaction known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or \u201ccytokine storm\u201d\nassociated with elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6).15 Laboratory\nfindings associated with worse clinical outcomes include lymphopenia, and elevations in\nliver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), inflammatory markers (e.g., C-reactive protein\n[CRP], ferritin), d-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), troponin and creatine\nphosphokinase (CPK), and acute kidney injury.15 Chest CT scans in\npatients with COVID-19 commonly show ground-glass opacification, consistent with viral\npneumonia with abnormalities more likely to be bilateral with a peripheral distribution\ninvolving the lower lobes.16 While SARS-CoV-2 entry is dependent on ACE2\nin lung cells,8 ACE2 expression is not exclusive to the lungs, and higher\nrelative ACE2 expression is observed in heart, kidney, GIT, and testes (Gene ID: 59272). The\norgan- and cell-specific expression of ACE2 suggests that it may play a role in the\nregulation of cardiovascular and renal function as well as fertility. Surprisingly, the 2003\nSARS-CoV infection was shown to downregulate the expression of ACE2 in lung tissue reducing\ntransmissibility but increasing virulence.17 ACE2, a component of the\nrenin-angiotensin system (RAS), catalyzes the cleavage of angiotensin I into angiotensin\n1\u20139 and angiotensin II into the vasodilator angiotensin 1\u20137.18 The balance between angiotensin II and angiotensin (1\u20137) is critical\nsince angiotensin II elicits vasoconstriction via the angiotensin AT1 receptor, whereas\nangiotensin (1\u20137) exerts a vasodilatory effect mediated by AT2 with multiple\nbeneficial effects on the cardiovascular and respiratory system.18 While\nACE2 appears to be involved in the hypertension and respiratory manifestations of severely\nill patients, the benefits and merits of ACE inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor 1\nblockers (ARBs) in the SARS-CoV-2 patient is still controversial.18 The\npriming of the S viral protein by TMPRSS2 is crucial for viral entry where TMPRSS2\nexpression is very high in the lungs, kidneys, and prostate tissue (Gene ID: 7113).8 TMPRSS2 is predominantly expressed in the luminal cells of the prostate\nepithelium, where its expression is regulated positively by androgens and negatively\nregulated by estrogens. The hormonal regulation of TMPRSS2 has been suggested to be linked\nto the fact that men are at higher risk than women to become seriously ill with\nCOVID-19.19 TMPRSS2 knockout in mice is not lethal. In contrast, humans\nare intolerant to the loss of function of ACE2.19 Concerns about the\neffect of ACEI and AT receptor blockers in COVID-19 patients are actively being investigated\nin the clinic, with the most recent reports offering encouragement that they may have a\nbeneficial effect.",

Unfortunately, the HIV protease inhibitors\nritonavir/liponavir failed to show efficacy in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.21 Hydroxychloroquine, which may act by increasing the pH within lysosomes,\nwas granted FDA authorization for use in emergency cases. Several antiviral agents are\nbeing tested such as the RdRp inhibitor remdesivir and the approved anti-influenza drug\nfaviprivir.8 Remdesivir was previously tested in humans with Ebola\nvirus disease and also in animal models of MERS and SARS-CoV.11 At\nleast six clinical trials are evaluating remdesivir in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Other drugs\nthat might inhibit RdRp include the broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin. RdRp\nconservation among RNA virus families makes it an exciting target for the discovery of\nnewer agents. The Spike protein, ACE2, and TMPRSS2 may also represent interesting\ntherapeutic targets for current drug repurposing efforts. Camostat mesylate, approved in\nJapan for treatment of pancreatic inflammation, has been shown to block TMPRSS2\nactivity.22 Arbidol, which is hypothesized to block Spike/ACE2\nbinding, is being investigated clinically, and a clinical trial was recently launched to\nstudy the effect of thiazide, thiazide-like diuretics, calcium channel blockers, ACE\ninhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers in COVID-19 (NCT04330300). The availability\nof soluble recombinant hACE2 encouraged its testing in two clinical trials; although one\nwas terminated (NCT04287686) the other is currently active (NCT04335136). Monoclonal\nantibodies, especially for interleukin-6 (IL-6) or its receptor, are also being considered\nfor the control of SARS-CoV-2 associated respiratory exacerbations.11\nInterestingly, several Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitors such as baricitinib and ruxolitinib\nare currently being evaluated given their involvement in interleukin signaling pathways.\nAnother currently recruiting clinical trial is testing quinolone, macrolide, and\n\u03b2-lactam antibiotics against COVID-19 (NCT02735707). Multiple groups have tested FDA\napproved drugs in various in vitro assays as well as in computational\nscreens. Many of these drugs show inhibitory activities, although not always at a\nconcentration that may be safely achieved in patients.23 Controlled\nclinical trials of these agents are mandatory to assess their efficacy and safety without\ncreating false positive hope or depleting the supplies of drugs needed to treat the\ndiseases for which they were initially approved.",

            "text": "Mpro and PLpro are cysteine proteases responsible for the cleavage\nof viral polypeptides into functional proteins for virus replication and packaging within\nhost cells.24 These enzymes represent the best characterized drug\ntargets among coronaviruses and are currently the focus of attention among scientists\nseeking novel coronavirus small molecule therapeutics.25\nMpro is shared by all coronavirus genera and has similarity to the\n3Cpro of the Enterovirus genus in the picornavirus\nfamily.24 Mpro contains a Cys\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7His\ncatalytic dyad with an additional \u03b1-helical domain involved in the dimerization of\nthe protease, which is essential for its catalytic activity.25 The\nenteroviral 3Cpro functions as a monomer featuring a classical\nCys\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7His\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7Glu/Asp catalytic triad.24\nYet, they share the almost absolute requirement for Gln in the P1 position of the\nsubstrate and space for only small residues such as Gly, Ala, or Ser in the P1\u2032\nposition. Since no human proteases with a similar cleavage specificity are known, it may\nbe possible to identify highly selective Mpro/3Cpro inhibitors,\nwhich display minimal inhibition of host proteases.26 The 3-D\nstructures of unliganded SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and of its complex with a\npeptidomimetic \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitor (11r) have been solved26 and were used to support the design of an optimized derivative\n(13b) through docking studies (Figure S2). \u03b1-Ketoamides can interact with the catalytic center of\nMpro through two hydrogen bonding interactions rather than only one as with\nother warheads such as aldehydes or Michael acceptors.24 Nucleophilic\nattack of the \u03b1-keto group by the catalytic Cys residue results in reversible\nformation of a thiohemiketal. These \u03b1-ketoamides feature a 5-membered rigid\n\u03b3-lactam as a mimic of the P1 residue, glutamine, required for Mpro\nspecificity, with the advantage of reducing the loss of entropy upon binding.24 Follow up optimization efforts guided by docking to the SARS-CoV-2\nMpro co-crystal structure with 11r, included incorporation of\nthe P3-P2 amide bond into a pyridone ring as in 13a. The resulting half-life\nof 13a in plasma was enhanced by 3 fold relative to 11r,\nin vitro kinetic plasma solubility improved by a factor of \u223c19\nand thermodynamic solubility by a factor of \u223c13. 13a inhibited\npurified recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, SARS-CoV Mpro, and MERS-CoV\nMpro in the submicromolar range.26 Modification of the\nP1\u2032 and P3 moieties of 13a afforded an optimized derivative\n13b which was crystallized with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB: 6Y2G and 6Y2F). Both 13a and 13b displayed good\nstability in mouse and human microsomes. 13b (3 mg/kg) showed longer\nt1/2, tmax, and residence time\ncompared to 13a (20 mg/kg) in CD-1 mice. Both compounds showed lung tropism\nwhich is thought to be beneficial. While the development of these ketoamides into clinical\ncandidates requires additional safety studies, the availability of their crystal\nstructures is of great importance in facilitating the discovery and development of other\nMpro inhibitors. One of the suggested agents for testing is the previously\nreported Rhinovirus and SARS-CoV Mpro inhibitor clinical candidate rupintrivir\n(AG-7088) (Figure S2). In addition, other groups recently reported Mpro\ncrystal structures with inhibitors such as the peptidomimetic Michael acceptor\nN3 (PDB: 6LU7) and\nthe reversible inhibitor X77 (PDB: 6W63) (Figure S2).27 A large array of Mpro crystal\nstructures with multiple covalent and noncovalent fragments were solved through an\nexceptionally large screen with vast opportunities for fragment growing and merging. The\ncryo EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp was recently solved, showing nearly an identical\nsequence to its SARS-CoV homologue.28 RdRp should be another high\npriority target for therapeutic intervention given that lead inhibitors such as remdesivir\nalready exist.",

Therefore, other\nepidemics are likely to occur in the future due to the effectively unlimited supply of\ncoronaviruses present in the bat population. Equally concerning is the fact that RNA viruses\nlack a genomic proof-reading mechanism and therefore are prone to mutation, raising the\nspecter that once a new coronavirus begins circulating in the human population it will be\nextremely difficult to eliminate. Finally, for a drug to be most effective, it must reach\nits site of action (e.g., lung tissues) in sufficient quantity to clear the virus. With\nnearly three million reported cases, >260,000 deaths, millions out of work, and billions\nof dollars in lost revenue, it appears that SARS-CoV-2 has altered daily life for a\nsustained period of time. This cascading effect has generated unprecedented momentum and\nscientific effort around the globe to fight this virus. Success will require creative\nthinking, new technologies, innovative approaches, particularly focused on speed to market,\nand combinations of different modalities to effectively combat not just the current foe but\nalso future coronaviruses.
