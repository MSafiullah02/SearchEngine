MERS-CoV is a new\ntype of coronavirus identified after the discovery of SARS-CoV, belongs to the Beta coronavirus\nlineage C [2], which causes severe acute respiratory disease with a high\nfatality rate. Moreover, the virus rapidly spread from the Middle East to many other countries including South Korea\nin 2015, demonstrating a global epidemic trend. However, no effective antiviral drug or vaccine has been developed to\ntreat MERS-CoV.",

The\ngenome includes two large replicase open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, encoding two viral replicase polyproteins.\nThe region downstream of ORF1 contains at least 10 small ORFs, encoding the spike protein (S), small envelope protein\n(E), membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N) and the assumed nonstructural proteins \n[3]. Among these proteins, the E protein is a relatively smaller but massively\nexpressed virus envelope protein and plays an important role in virus membrane packaging \n[4]. MERS-CoV is a new type coronavirus with a 30.1 kb long genome. Similar to\nthe other coronaviruses, the E protein is a small structural protein in MERS-CoV which was identified as the\nstructural component of the virus. Previous studies suggest that the E proteins are scattered on the surface of the\nvirus envelope and play various important roles in regulating the viral life cycles in some coronaviruses \n[3], [5], \n[6], [7].

Selected sequences were downloaded from NCBI database and analyzed by each program.\nABCpred uses a recurrent method which is based on a neural network algorithm [8]\n (http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/abcpred/ABC_submission.html). The lengths of amino acids were set\nto 12-mer, 14-mer, 16-mer, 18-mer, and 20-mer and the scoring threshold was set to 0.8. Since there is no evidence\nshowing that 20 amino acids is the optimal length for B-cell epitopes, a length of 15\u201320 amino acids is\ngenerally considered. Optimal length is determined by the overall score, higher score indicates a better chance that a\nsequence is an antigen epitope. Bepipred was developed by Larsen et al. [9] (\nhttp://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred/) and it implements a hidden Markov model and a propensity scale\nmethod as described by Parker et al. [10]. A threshold of 0.350 was used. For\nthis threshold the sensitivity is 0.49 and the specificity is 0.75. The Protean program in LaserGene software uses the\nGarnjer-Robson, Chou-Fasman and Karplus-Schulz methods to predict the protein's secondary structure. The\nparameters of each residue were determined by P\u03b1, P\u03b2, PT, and PC values \n[11]. According to the Kyte-Doolittle standard for hydrophilic amino acids, potential B cell linear epitopes\nwere usually the hydrophilic regions on the protein surface (as described by Emini). Karplus-Schulz method was used to\nidentify the flexible regions of the E protein. Jameson-Wolf method was used to predict the antigenic index. The\nsignificance of the parameters has been described previously [12], \n[13], [14]. All the resulting\nsequences were collected and aligned using Clustal W multiple sequence alignment programs. Overlapped regions were\nconsidered as the potential epitopes.",

Because the mortality rate of the MERS-CoV is as high as 40 percent, it\nis considered as one of the most critical emerging pathogens threatening human health. Previous study showed that a\nrecombinant SL-CoV containing a very small fragment of the SARS-CoV S gene was able to infect and cause disease in\nmice, highlighting its potential for pathogenicity in humans [22]. However,\ncharacterization of the immunogenic determinants for the MERS-CoV protein remains unresolved. Here in our study we\nfound that the gene sequences of MERS-CoV were moderately conserved among different coronavirus strains although\nCotten et al. studied MERS-CoV gene diversity and found numerous variations among different strains \n[23]. Nevertheless, at least two distinct lineages, including circulating and\ntransmission patterns in the epidemic, are consistent in both human-to-human transmission and sporadic zoonotic\nevents. The E protein, which is essential for virus packaging, is a moderately expressed small transmembrane protein\nand presented on the surface of virus envelope as well as the infected cells. Our further comparison studies showed\nthat the E protein is highly conserved among different virus strains isolated from different species (e.g., Camelus\ndromedarius, Vespertilio superans and Homo sapiens) at different times and locations near the endemic areas \n[24]. Since sequence alignment revealed that the E protein from the 42 strains\nwere nearly identical except a point mutation from isoleucine to valine. And Durai P \n[25] had stated that MERS-CoV E protein has striking similarities to SARS-CoV E protein, which has a resolved\nNMR structure. Therefore E protein was chosen as a potential antigenic target for the humoral immune responses, which\nmight be significant for developing better diagnostic and research reagents in the future.",
