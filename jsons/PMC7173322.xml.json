            "text": "Human Bocavirus (HBoV), currently classified in the genus Bocavirus within the family Parvoviridae, was first described in 2005 after large-scale molecular screening of respiratory specimens for virus genome sequences led to its discovery.1 The etiologic role of HBoV in the causation of respiratory illness is not clearly defined due to lack of viral propagation techniques in cell culture or animal models.1 However, many studies have reported finding this virus associated with respiratory tract infections, especially in infants and young children.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The virus has been reported worldwide,6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 with incidence rates determined by nucleic acid amplification ranging from 3 to 19%.7, 12, 13, 14, 15 Recently, the virus has also been identified in blood and faecal samples.12, 16, 17, 18, 19 Epidemiological data reported in most previous studies have been generated using the NP1 gene for HBoV detection. However, the complete coding sequence of this virus in the database is incomplete, and thus, the true prevalence of the virus may be slightly underestimated.1 In order to better understand the genomic and epidemiological profiles of HBoV infection in Taiwan, we examined specimens from pediatric patients with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). The genes of HBoV were determined using a newly designed set of conserved primers to both amplify and sequence. All experiments involving human material were approved by an ethical commission from the local partner university hospitals.",

Purified amplicons were cycle sequenced by using BigDye 3.1 Terminator cycle sequencing reagents, with reaction products resolved on an ABI Prism 3130XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Forest City, CA, USA). For phylogenetic analysis, regions of the NS1, NP1, and VP1/VP2 genes were amplified and sequenced. Four primers were used to amplify and sequence the NS1 gene, and two primers were used to amplify and sequence the NP1 gene. Primer sequences are shown in Table 1\n. In addition, primers from a previous publication22 were used to amplify and sequence VP1/VP2 genes. Complete coding sequences were determined according to a previous report23. Nucleotide sequence data were analyzed using Version 10.3 of the sequence analysis software package of the University of Wisconsin Genetic Group. Phylogeny construction and evaluation were performed with the maximum likelihood (ML) and neighbor-joining (NJ) methods in the Phylip software package (Version 3.66, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA)24 and Bayesian analysis in the Mr. Bayes software (Version 3.1).25, 26 Empirical transition/transversion ratio was estimated by the TREE-PUZZEL software (Version 5.2)27 to calculate evolutionary distances. The robustness of the NJ tree was statistically evaluated by bootstrap analysis with 1000 bootstrap samples. Since the ML method is already a statistically validated method (with a statistical evaluation of the branch length), no bootstrapping was done for this method. For Bayesian analysis, nucleotide substitution model was estimated by MrModeltest (Version 2.2).28 Split decomposition in the Splits tree (Version 4.8, www.splitstree.org)29 and BootScan in the SimPlot (Version 3.5.1, SCRoftware)30 were used to detect evolutionary networks.",

The 5.2 kb genome of HBoV contains 3 ORFs (open reading frames) encoding NS1, NP1, and VP1/VP2 genes. Phylogenetic analysis of these 3 ORFs in 15 HBoV strains did not reveal any genotypic differences between the strains from Taiwan and other countries (similarity 99\u2013100%). Analysis of the nucleotide sequences encoding the complete genome (positions 1-5262) of Taiwanese strains showed that most of strains were genetically close to ST1 or ST2 (GenBank accession number DQ0000495 and DQ0000496, identified by Allander et al.1, with the phylogenetic tree clearly divided into two major groups (I and II) (Fig. 1A). Group I could be further divided into three subgroups, the first comprised of ST1 and TW674_07viruses (Ia), the second comprised of ST2 viruses (Ib), and the third comprised of 7 Taiwanese strains (Ic). Group II was comprised of 3 strains (TW2715_06, TW2717_06, and CU74). These data demonstrate that at least 3 clusters of HBoV co-circulated in Taiwan during the study period. Amino acid sequences encoded by the NS1, NP1, VP1, and VP2 genes are shown in Table 3\n. All 7 Taiwanese strains in group Ic had amino acid changes at position S590T of VP1 numbering in comparison with sequence of ST2 (Table 3). Similarity plots of the HBoV TW2717_06 sequence with CU74 and CU74W consensus sequences suggested the presence of one point of crossover (Fig. 2B) with the most likely breakpoints located at 1500\u20131600 bp.",

Our findings support the hypothesis that HBoV might play a role in the pathogenesis of LRTIs. Further studies are required to determine whether HBoV plays a causative role in LRTI or acts as an exacerbating factor that simple increases the severity of infections caused by other pathogens.",

There was no temporal link between any of the groups as they were equally distributed throughout the study period. Each individual gene (Fig. 1) of HBoV was constructed and our results show that the greatest sequence variations occurred in the VP1/VP2 gene. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the two different groups of HBoV identified in Taiwan are genetically distinct. One is remarkably similar to the initial strains of HBoV identified in Sweden and the other one is similar to the strain (CU74) detected in Thailand. Likelihood-mapping analysis suggests that each ORF may have some \u201cunresolved\u201d phylogenetic signal, and that NS1 may not be the best gene with which to construct a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic trees constructed by NJ and ML methods showed a similar topology. A monophyletic group with longer branch length consisted only of Taiwanese HBoV isolates suggests that this virus might have circulated in Taiwan for a certain period (Fig. 1A). Moreover, computing the evolutionary networks from sequence data by applied splitstree software,29 there appeared to be at least 2 networks among Asian strains (Fig. 2A). This finding suggests that the virus might have circulated simultaneously in several locations and that simultaneous infections with different strains might have occurred, resulting in an opportunity for interbreeding of virus and genetic recombination among the viral genes. It should be noted that recombinant HBoV has been reported; however, we are unaware of other HBoV mosaic genomes with a breakpoint pattern similar to the one presented here. This leads to speculation that if the recombinant variant continues to circulate, further genetic evolution may allow more efficient transmission in an exposed population.",

In conclusion, our data demonstrate that HBoV is circulating in Taiwan and suggest that HBoV might be involved in the pathogenesis of lower respiratory tract disease in children. Furthermore, our results indicate that genetically distinct HBoVs co-circulated in Taiwan during 2006\u20132007 and that recombinance among these viruses occurred contributing to the genetic diversity of the circulating strains. Importantly, data presented here provide evidence suggesting that HBoV may undergo gene recombination to evade host immunological response.
