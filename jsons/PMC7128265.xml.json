The consequences of PRRSV infection have been well documented for the reproductive system and for systemic infection (Christianson et al., 1992, Botner et al., 1994, Mengeling et al., 1996, Lager et al., 1997, Kranker et al., 1998). Numerous studies have evaluated the clinical, pathological and immunological features of the respiratory form of PRRS (Labarque et al., 2000, Samsom et al., 2000, Opriessnig et al., 2002), but the effects on pulmonary function have not been investigated, even though respiratory dysfunction may have a significant impact on the clinical outcome of the disease.",

Gross lung lesions include failure of the lungs to collapse, as well as moderately well demarcated, mottled, brown areas of pneumonia (Opriessnig et al., 2002). Microscopic lung lesions are characterised by type II pneumocytic hypertrophy and hyperplasia, septal infiltration with mononuclear cells and alveolar exudates (Opriessnig et al., 2002). No data are currently available on the pathophysiological features and derangements of pulmonary function induced by PRRSV. Since the lungs are important for oxygen supply to all tissues, pulmonary dysfunction might have significant clinical and subclinical systemic consequences.",

Decreases in Xrs indicate reduced compliance of the lung. This might be caused by restrictive disorders due to both stiffness of obstructed airways and pulmonary tissue components.

Limiting oxygen diffusion from the alveoli to the blood can be explained by increased diffusion distance due to infiltration of alveolar walls by mononuclear cells. In addition, hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the alveolar epithelial cells, as well as the presence of alveolar exudates, decreases the amount of gas within alveoli. Alveolar hypoventilation due to a rapid and superficial pattern of breathing may also contribute to decreased oxygen exchange. In the pig, which has no collateral airways (McLaughlin et al., 1961), each airway obstruction results in regional heterogeneity of alveolar ventilation (Robinson, 1982). Consequently, obstruction of ventilation in pigs exposed to PRRSV most likely resulted in imbalances between ventilation and perfusion, leading to reduced oxygen transfer from the lungs into the blood. This would result in respiratory acidosis characterised by reduced pH and increased partial CO2 pressure in venous blood, indicating reduced alveolar ventilation.",
