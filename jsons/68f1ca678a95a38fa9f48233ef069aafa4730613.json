There may be differences in the health status of calves that may affect the ability to consume and use high MR levels. When feeding high-risk calves there may be a need for alternate strategies when determining the quality and quantity of MR being fed when compared with low-risk calves. Differences in gut integrity may influence the ability of high-risk calves to handle high levels of MR early in life. Potential issues with high-risk calves being fed a HPN might be reduced with increased feeding times per day, a gradual step-up method, or other nutritional strategies that improve gastrointestinal development and function.",

            "text": "The influence that PON has on the risk for enteric disease during the preweaning period continues to be debated. A study completed by Quigley et al. (2006) reported that calves force fed greater quantities of milk solids had increased incidence of scours and antimicrobial treatments, whereas Ollivett et al. (2012) reported improved recovery and better hydration following a Cryptosporidium challenge in calves that were free fed. It is generally accepted that when calves are fed greater quantities of milk solids, their fecal consistency appears looser or they tend to have more diarrhea. Liang et al. (2016) reported that fecal consistency may not be the best indicator of enteric health because even though the feces look more loose, there was no difference in the DM percentage of the feces from healthy calves fed lesser versus greater planes of milk-replacer nutrition. Another concern with feeding a reduced PON is that a lower PON does not satiate calves and possibly can cause prolonged expression of extra nonnutritive oral behaviors. High-risk calves experiencing failure of passive transfer (FPT) of colostrum require particular care and management, and increased rates of sickness may impede nonnutritive oral behavior development (Hulbert and Mois\u00e1, 2016) . Increased health risks, including gastrointestinal ailments, are common in colostrum-deprived calves. High-risk calves are calves that may have FPT, increased exposure to pathogens, or increased stressors such as transport in the first few days of life. Thus, nutritional planes may especially influence these high-risk calves. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether preweaning PON influences performance, behavior, and health in high-risk neonatal calves.",

Calves were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments (n = 18 calves per treatment): a low plane (LPN) of milk-replacer nutrition or a high plane (HPN) of milkreplacer nutrition. Calves fed the LPN were fed 455 g of DM/d of a 20% CP, 20% lipid milk replacer (MR) at 12% solids DM (Herd Maker, Land O'Lakes Animal Milk Protein Co., Shoreview, MN; Table 1 ). Calves fed the HPN were fed 830 g of DM/d from 1 d of age to 10 d of age and 1,080 g of DM/d from 11 d until weaning of a 28% CP, 20% lipid MR at 14.9 and 15.5% solids DM (Cow's Match, Land O'Lakes Animal Milk Protein Co., Table 1 ). Calves were fed MR from bottles twice daily at 0730 and 1630 h. All calves were offered ad libitum access to a texturized calf starter (Table 1 ) and water. Peripheral blood samples were collected from the jugular vein into evacuated tubes without any additive at enrollment and analyzed for total serum protein using a hand-held refractometer. A total serum protein concentration of 5.2 g/dL was used as the threshold to determine the proportion of calves that had FPT of immunoglobulins, based on information from Tyler et al. (1996) , who developed a regression equation where a total serum protein concentration of 5.2 g/dL was equivalent to 1,000 mg/dL of serum IgG 1 . Total serum protein concentrations confirmed that 72% of HPN and 76% of LPN calves had FPT (<5.2 g/dL). All calves were housed outdoors in commercially available calf hutches (2.13 \u00d7 1.09 m, Agri-Plastics, Cortland, NY) with an attached pen (1.83 \u00d7 1.09 m) bedded with sand, and bottle holder, water-bucket, and grain-bucket located inside the hutch. Calf starter and water intakes were measured daily. Calves were vaccinated with a 5-way (infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine viral diarrhea virus I and II, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza-3; Triangle 5; Boehringer Ingelheim, Ridgefield, CT) vaccine at 28 d and a booster at 42 d. Weaning was initiated at 51 d by removal of the afternoon feeding. Calves were completely weaned from MR beginning after 58 d once they consumed 1 kg as fed/d of calf starter.",

At midnight at 6 d of age, the accelerometers and event loggers began recording every 30 s each time the calf manipulated the dummy nipple (at a rate of 1 Hz), respectively. Every 1 to 3 wk, all logging devices were removed, data were downloaded, and loggers were refixed to the calves and hutches. Automated logger data were downloaded and processed using methods previously described (Ledgerwood et al., 2010; Hill et al., 2013; Hulbert et al., 2015) ; standing duration and pacifier use (min/d) were the main variables of interest.

A linear mixed model with the fixed effects of treatment, time, and the interaction of treatment by time were fitted. Calf nested within treatment was the subject of the repeated statement. The mean model was run with all available covariance structures for the withinsubject measurements. The appropriate covariance structure was chosen for each analysis based on the Schwarz's Bayesian information criterion. Initial BW and total serum protein at enrollment were included in the model as covariates and remained in the model even if they were not significant. Total serum protein was a significant covariant (P = 0.039) for calf starter intake. Pairwise differences were performed at each time interval for significant treatment \u00d7 time interactions using a sliced effect multiple comparison approach using a Tukey-Kramer adjustment. Fecal scores were averaged by 3 consecutive days, and the residuals were normally distributed and therefore analyzed as a continuous repeated measure. Head and body score as well as incidence of scours, bloat, mortality, and antibiotic use were analyzed using a Fisher's exact test with the FREQ procedure of SAS (SAS version 9.1, SAS Institute Inc.). Before analysis, repeated data were tested for normality of the residuals by evaluating the Shapiro-Wilk statistic, normal probability plots of the residuals, and histograms of the residuals using the UNIVARIATE procedure of SAS (SAS version 9.1, SAS Institute Inc.).",

Studies using calves with FPT reported reduced ADG compared with calves with appropriate passive transfer (Pithua and Aly, 2013) . Calves fed HPN had greater ADG in every period, with the exception of 50 to 68 d. At this time, calves were undergoing weaning. A probable contributor to the reduced ADG among HPN calves was likely due to the lower calf starter intake as well as digestibility of that calf starter at that time. Calves fed a HPN ate less starter throughout the study. Similarly, Huber et al. (1984) reported calves fed greater MR amounts consumed less calf starter. However, once weaned, previous studies observed that the HPN rapidly increase calf starter intake and can exceed LPN calves a few weeks after weaning (Ballou, 2012; Obeidat et al., 2013; Ballou et al., 2015) .",

Greater fecal scores in calves fed a HPN are routinely considered a consequence of greater milk solids consumed. More importantly, the HPN calves had a greater incidence of scouring than LPN calves. Scours were considered if a calf had 2 consecutive fecal scores of 4. Previously, Ballou (2011) reported that anything greater than or equal to a fecal score of 3 was considered scours. However, Liang et al. (2016) reported the DM of feces from calves with a fecal score 3 and concluded it would be unlikely for most calves to become dehydrated with a fecal score of 3 or less. The moderate increase in fecal scores reported by others when feeding HPN would not increase the risk for dehydration. In contrast, when a calf has a fecal score of 4, the calf is at an increased risk to become dehydrated or develop metabolic acidosis. Scours can be infectious or noninfectious; however, the consequences are similar. A study completed by Quigley et al. (2006) reported findings that high-risk calves force fed a variable HPN program had greater incidence of scours and were treated with more antimicrobials than calves fed a restricted quantity of milk solids when Figure 1 . Intakes of milk solids, calf starter, and total (milk replacer + calf starter) during the preweaning period among calves fed either a low (LPN) or high (HPN) plane of nutrition. The LPN calves were fed 455 g of DM/d of milk replacer (20% DM lipid and protein) until weaning, and the HPN calves were fed 830 g of DM/d of milk replacer (20 and 28% DM lipid and protein) during the first 10 d and 1,080 g from 11 d until weaning. Intakes were recorded daily. Treatment \u00d7 time interactions existed (P \u2264 0.001) for milk replacer intake and total intake, and a tendency existed (P = 0.065) for starter intake. Treatment differences (P \u2264 0.05) are reported as MILK, STARTER, and TOTAL for milk replacer, calf starter, and total intakes. Data are presented as least squares means. Largest SEM estimates were 0.24, 2.27, and 2.36 for milk replacer, calf starter, and total intakes, respectively. raised on bedding contaminated with coronavirus. Force feeding high-risk calves has been reported to increase scours and is not a recommended nutrition strategy for sick calves and, therefore, was not included in this study design. Liang et al. (2016) reported that healthy 1-wk-old calves fed either a low or high PON had no differences in the DE or ME efficiencies, concluding healthy neonatal calves are capable of digesting greater MR concentrations during the first week of life. In fact, healthy neonatal calves fed a high PON may be more capable of absorbing and utilizing those additional nutrients than calves fed a low PON. Further, Liang et al. (2016) reported increased digestible CP and nitrogen retention as a percentage of intake when fed the high PON. They concluded that healthy calves are able to digest and use the extra nutrients very efficiently during the first week of life; however, they constrained the inferences to healthy calves.",

Calves failing to receive colostrum were reported to have reduced gastrointestinal integrity, as reflected in decreased mucosal thickness, as well as decreased villus length and width compared with calves that received colostrum (Yang et al., 2015) . Further, increased colostrum intake improved intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and maturation as well as enzymatic activity (Bl\u00e4ttler et al., 2001) . Colostrum not only influences gut integrity but also contains immune components and nutrients that are considered a major factor in preweaning health. Failure of passive transfer is associated with poorer preweaning performance and health (Naylor et al., 1977; Donovan et al., 1998; Pithua and Aly, 2013) . These highrisk calves receiving the HPN may have had reduced gut integrity and local immune protection and, as a result, were less tolerant to the additional milk solids, which increased the risk for scours.",

Although the incidence of bloat is often sporadic and the etiology not completely understood, a reduced abomasal emptying rate and increased fermentable substrates in the abomasum are risk factors (Burgstaller et al., 2017) . Increasing the solids content or osmolality of MR fed can delay abomasal emptying, and feeding a high PON also may increase the nutrients available for rapid fermentation by Clostridium perfringens, a microorganism often suspected in abomasal bloat. More research is needed to understand how PON influences abomasal dynamics and health.",

Before weaning, PON did not influence dummy-nipple use, except at 15 d, when LPN calves tended to use the nipple more than HPN calves. The day before this (14 d), daily standing duration was increased among all calves, which was likely caused by research personnel spending most of the day setting up video recording equipment. Nonetheless, after weaning was completed, the HPN calves increased dummy-nipple use to over 3 times their preweaning frequencies until 64 d of age. This is an indicator that the stress of weaning was likely greater among HPN calves. The HPN calves had MR as the main component of that diet, and the HPN calves were only motivated to use the dummy nipple when that source of satiety was removed. The HPN calves returned to their preweaning dummy-nipple use by 64 d, and by this age the calves may have been consuming enough starter to become satiated. This is in contrast to data reported by Bortoluzzi (2019) , where step-down weaning calves fed a HPN at 50 d did not increase their use of the dummy nipple, whereas HPN calves either stepdown weaned at 39 d or gradually weaned by decreasing the quantity of milk offered from 43 to 57 d had relatively greater use of the dummy nipple. The authors concluded it may have been less stressful to wean those calves from HPN at the older age, 50 d in that study, because they were consuming more starter. Even though the calves in the present study were weaned at approximately the same age and in the same manner as the calves in the study by Bortoluzzi (2019) , the high-risk nature of the calves resulted in reduced calf starter intake and, therefore, required either a later or possibly an even more gradual weaning.",

No difference in either serum glucose or urea nitrogen was observed between treatments. Similarly, Obeidat et al. (2013) and Smith et al.

Both milk replacers were formulated with similar macro-and microingredients and included dried whey, dried whey protein concentrate, dried whey product, dried skim milk, dried milk protein, animal fat, lecithin, polysorbate 80, dicalcium phosphate, calcium carbonate, brewers dried yeast, vitamin A acetate, d-\u03b1-tocopherol acetate, vitamin D 3 , thiamine monohydrate, riboflavin, niacin supplement, folic acid, vitamin B 12 supplement, choline chloride, zinc methionine complex, manganese methionine complex, copper lysine complex, iron amino acid complex, ethylenediamine dihydroiodide, selenium yeast, and natural and artificial flavor. No direct-fed microbials or yeast extract was added in either milk replacer. 2 Calf starter on a DM basis was 44.5% steam-flaked corn, 19.0% rolled oats, 22.0% soybean meal with 48% CP, 10.0% cane molasses, 3.0% vitamin and mineral premix, and 1.5% tallow. The vitamin and mineral premix contained on a DM basis 72% limestone, 20% dicalcium phosphate, 6% salt, 0.451% zinc sulfate, 0.4% selenium selenite 0.2%, 0.267% manganese oxide, 0.18% vitamin E-500 IU/g, 0.157% copper sulfate, 142 mg/kg vitamin A-1,000 KIU/g, and 12.5 mg/kg ethylenediamine dihydroiodide. 3 Calculated based on the NRC (2001).renzo et al.

A custom-designed dummy nipple with a sensor (described byHulbert et al., 2015; created by Meter Mall USA, Marysville, OH) was left in the bottle holder of the hutch from 5 to 68 d of age, except during MR feedings. The sensor was located in a dummy nipple, and when the calf manipulated the nipple (suck, head butt, push), the sensor activated the attached event-recording logger (UX90-001Ml; Onset Computer Corp.",
