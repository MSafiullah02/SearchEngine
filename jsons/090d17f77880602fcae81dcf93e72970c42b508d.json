TRIAL ONE involved HRT testing in healthy women and with uterus intact the impact of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE, Premarin, 0.625 mg/day) plus progestin (medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg/day vs. placebo). The primary objective was to determine the HRT impact on CHD prevention, with breast cancer as an anticipated adverse effect. Additional HRT-related conditions constituted secondary objectives. Overall, 16,608 women were randomized to this trial. 2. TRIAL TWO was designed for women without uterus and randomized to conjugated equine estrogens (CEE, Premarin) alone vs. placebo, with the same objectives as TRIAL ONE. Altogether, 10,739 women were recruited to this trial. 3. TRIAL THREE tested low fat against conventional diet for breast and colorectal cancer prevention, with 48,835 women randomized. 4. TRIAL FOUR tested the impact of calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Hip fractures were the designated primary outcome, with other fractures and colorectal cancer as secondary outcomes. In total, 36,282 women were randomized to this trial.",

Most intriguing were data associating HRT with a signifi cant all-cause mortality reduction [2] [3] [4] [5] , and paradoxically, despite increased breast cancer incidence rates, with improved rates of breast cancer mortality [5] .",

Screening mammography reached maximum in the late 1990s, with 70.1% of women having biennial mammograms [92] . In parallel, postmenopausal breast cancer rates according to SEER's data declined, and began to shift from older into younger ages at onset, probably because prevalent older screened breast cancer patients were removed from the general population [92] . Recent declines in HRT usage after the July 2002 WHI announcement have likely accelerated this decreasing incidence trend among older women.",

The promotional rather than carcinogenic mechanisms would implicate the HRT effect primarily on the preformed malignant lesions, with resulting increased cell division of hormone sensitive clones. The accelerated formation of microcalcifi cations, and subsequently, earlier diagnosis through mammogram or physical examination would follow. In those women, however, the carcinogenic events presumably had occurred earlier and most likely with no connection with HRT.

As the HDL/LDL ratio is one of the best predictors of future cardiovascular outcomes [31] , it is plausible that in the long-term there could be signifi cant benefi t of estrogen use due to reduced atherogenesis. This mechanism may explain the long-term HRT benefi ts in the primary prevention of cardiac events [32] [33] [34] , which exceeds its shortterm hazards attributed, in all likelihood, to the HRTassociated increase in the rates of thromboembolism. The most convincing evidence for the benefi cial effects of HRT on lipid metabolism comes from the Postmenopasual Estrogen/Progestin Interventions, the PEPI trial [15] , showing a signifi cant reduction, at 3 years follow-up, of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) in HRT users, with HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels increased compared to pretreatment levels. The PEPI trial is the fi rst placebo controlled randomized study to document that estrogen either alone or in combination with progestin signifi cantly improves the serum lipid profi le, thus confi rming number of reports from nonrandomized studies. The results of the study also suggest that the effect on lipids may be comparable between estrogen alone and estrogen/progestin combination, particularly, using the newly available micronized progestin. The signifi cance of these data for prevention of cardiac mortality is yet to be determined. The long-term followup of the ongoing randomized WHI trial [35] will provide a defi nitive answer to this issue. The PEPI trial is particularly important in view of other studies in which a modest incremental HDL-C increase (4-5 mg/dL) was associated with a 20-25% reduction of CHD. These fi ndings are in line with the long-term follow-up of the observational HRT studies.",

Indeed, most interventions for the secondary prevention are expected to relieve symptoms, slow down progression, but not to completely reverse the lesions. Although the favorable lipid changes are seen early, the effects of HRT on the cardiovascular outcomes may take decades. It has also been predicted that, compared to its effect in primary prevention, hormonal therapy will have lower impact once the process of atherosclerosis has already advanced. Indeed, the only randomized trial of secondary prevention, the HERs study, showed little cardiovascular protection. HERS trial was fi rst published in the late 1990s [69] and updated recently [70] . A total of 2,763 women, 65 years or older (mean age: 66.7 years), with a history of myocardial infarction, were randomized in a double-blind placebo-controlled design, to be treated with either HRT (conjugated equine estrogen, CEE, 0.635 mg, plus daily medroxyprogesterone acetate, MPA, 2.5 mg/day) or placebo. At 4 years of follow-up, the authors reported no signifi cant differences in deaths from CHD or myocardial infarction between the two arms (RR > 0.99, 95% CI: 0. 80-1.22) . The lack of an overall effect was seen despite a reduction of LDL levels and increase of HDL levels. More women in the HRT group had thromboembolic events (TEs) (RR > 2.89, 95% CI 1. 50-5.58 ) and gallbladder disease (RR > 1.38, CI 1.00-1.92). There was no difference in cancer rates or overall mortality. For the latter two parameters, however, the power of the study was greatly limited. The authors' conclusion was that HRT does not reduce the overall rate of CHD in postmenopausal women with established coronary disease, and that the risk of thromboembolism and of gall stones is increased.",

As a result, HRT is known to moderately increase the incidence of thromboembolism with HR ranging from 1.1-4.00 [3, 58, 69, [79] [80] [81] . However, despite these trends, no increase in mortality with HRT has been reported [82] . Abnormalities of clotting factors, however, may contribute to the HRT-associated complications [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] . It has been shown that a genetic variant of Factor V Leiden (especially the Factor V G1691A variant) is responsible for the majority of TEs in users of birth control pills [84] . In women with established coronary disease, as reported in two clinical trials, the Leiden mutation was present in 8 (16.7%) of 48 cases with TEs compared with only 7 (6.3%) of 112 without TEs. In women with the factor V Leiden mutation who were treated with HRT, the estimated absolute incidence of TEs was 15.4 in 1,000 per year compared with 2.0 in 1,000 per year in women without the mutation who were taking a placebo (HR = 7.7) [87] . Van de Water [85] confi rmed that in patients with myocardial infarction, the frequency of factor V Leiden mutation was 14.6% in patients <50 years old in the study group compared with 3.6% in patients in the control group [83] .",

Subsequently, women continuing on HRT would experience fewer TEs, and may benefi t, in long-term, from HRT. The \"timing\" hypothesis (see below) suggests that more adverse CVS events are related to thromboembolism in the fi rst years of HRT exposure, followed by reduced hazard rates.
