            "text": "Nonetheless, clinical and animal studies have shown that the activation of multiple inflammatory cells and the release of inflammatory mediators play important roles in the development and outcome of ARDS [5]. The involvement of immune cells, including neutrophils [6, 7] lymphocytes [8], and regulatory T-cell [9, 10], has become an active topic of research in ARDS pathogenesis. To date, few clinical studies on the immune status of ARDS patients have focused on aetiology, treatment and prognosis [11]. Immunocompromised individuals represent a significant proportion of ARDS patients [11, 12], these patients do not have the ability to respond normally to an infection due to an impaired or weakened immune system. Some studies have shown that ARDS occurs in patients with previous immunodeficiencies, such as haematologic malignancies, active solid tumours, solid organ transplantation, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, as well as in patients taking long-term or high-dose corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, and those who use extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may have a better prognosis [13]. Compared with immunocompetent subjects, ARDS patients with typical immunodeficiency have higher mortality regardless of ARDS severity [11]. In addition, atypical immunosuppression is frequently found among ARDS patients, and virus infections are also increasingly being reported in ARDS patients without typical immunosuppression [13]. Overall, there is currently a lack of uniform molecular markers for patients with atypical immunosuppression or impaired status. Furthermore, it is not well known whether the status of atypical immunodeficiency affects the prognosis of ARDS. Managing patients with atypical immunosuppression in intensive care unit (ICU) can be challenging, updated epidemiological and outcomes studies are needed to evaluate the condition of these patients.",

Another discovery was that the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio and age were related to ICU mortality and hospital mortality. We also found associations between the baseline lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio and age, the SOFA score, the APACHE II score, the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, and the severity of ARDS according to the Berlin classification.

Previous studies have focused on the poor prognosis of patients with severe lymphopenia from the first day of ICU admission [21]. In our study, peripheral blood lymphopenia was very common in ARDS patients without typical underlying diseases, causing immunosuppression. The number of peripheral blood lymphocytes decreased significantly in patients with severe ARDS, and in non-survivors also. Moreover, the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio progressively decreased with increasing ARDS severity, and a significantly lower lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio was found in non-survivors than in survivors.",

In our study, ARDS patients with a lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio < 0.0537 had a higher 28-day mortality rate than did those with a lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio \u2265 0.0537. The lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio may reveal the balance between lymphocyte and neutrophil counts. Lymphocytes are important immune cells involved in response to ARDS and in prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed that a decrease in the lymphocyte count was associated with a 2.32\u20133.76-fold increase in the risk of death among patients with or without septic shock [22]. In addition, both B-lymphocyte and CD8 + T-lymphocyte counts correlated positively with peripheral blood lymphocyte counts in our study, these counts in non-survivors were significantly lower than those in survivors, and the findings suggest increased risk of death in ARDS patients when the lymphocyte count decreases below a certain value. Neutrophils are another type of immune cell involved in the process of sepsis, and a relative increase in the total number of circulating neutrophils and the percent increase in neutrophils with immature morphology are also closely related to sepsis [23, 24]. Compared with counts in survivors, higher neutrophil counts were found in patients who eventually died as a result of sepsis-induced ARDS, and excessive accumulation of neutrophils in patients with ARDS may therefore contribute to disease progression [6, 8]. Therefore, the combination of lymphopenia and neutrophilia contributes to the outcome of ARDS, which may explain why the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio in our study was a strong independent predictor of prognosis.",

We further found that the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio AUC was higher than the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, BMI, APACHE II score, and SOFA score alone in predicting 100-day survival in ARDS patients. In combination with the lymphocyte count slightly increased the AUC of the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio in predicting 100-day survival, yet there was no difference compared with the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio alone. Moreover, ARDS patients with a lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio \u2265 0.0537 had a lower 28-day mortality rate, and significantly moderate negative correlations were found between the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio and age, the SOFA score, and the APACHE II score. In addition, a moderate positive correlation between the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was been noted. These results suggest that the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio can comprehensively and plausibly reflect the patient\u2019s physiological, pathophysiological and respiratory oxygenation index status. Taken together, our findings strongly suggest that the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio is a potential indicator and good indicator for prognosis evaluation among ARDS patients.",

            "text": "There have been many clinical studies on ARDS patients with typical immunodeficiency [13, 28], and immunodeficiency in ARDS patients is usually atypical. Although it does not reach the level found in typical immunodeficiency, there is already a degree of immune impairment. Nonetheless, there are few studies on atypical immune deficiency or impaired immunity in ARDS patients, and there is no uniform scale or biomarker to measure immune impairment in ARDS patients and its relationship with prognosis. A consensus has not been reached regarding whether viral infection causes immune deficiency, though it is commonly thought to induce immune impairment but not to the extent of immune deficiency. In our study, there was no significant difference in viral infection status between the survivor and non-survivor groups. However, we did observe that the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio in the survivor group were higher than those in the non-survivor group. We hypothesize that a low lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio may be a marker of this atypical immunodeficiency in ARDS patients, affecting their prognosis. There are no recognized biomarkers to date that can be used to identify the immune status of ARDS patients. Accordingly, we propose a new biomarker for the identification of atypical immune status in patients with ARDS. This status may be due to abnormal inhibitors that have been be activated. We hope that by observing the association of the early lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio with prognosis may result in better detection and more timely treatment of an abnormal immune status.",

First, this study had a relatively small sample size, even though it was the first study to explore the prognostic value of the lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio for prognosis in ARDS patients. Second, there may be a selection bias because only patients for whom absolute lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were measured soon after ARDS diagnosis were included. Third, the current study was not pre-specified but is a post hoc analysis from a retrospective controlled trial. Therefore, further prospective studies are needed.",
