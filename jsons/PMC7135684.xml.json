A patient with chest radiographic findings of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or unexplained respiratory disease resulting in death with autopsy results demonstrating the pathology comparable with SARS is considered a probable case. Although the WHO has provided the guidelines for SARS control and some diagnostic tools such as polymerase chain reaction,6, 7, 9 indirect fluorescent antibody, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibody are being developed,9 there are still many clinical difficulties in diagnosing the disease quickly. For example, the sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction is still uncertain, and the antibody titer may be detectable at the 10th to 21st day after the onset of SARS.9 It is a difficult issue for emergency physicians to detect patients with SARS specifically if there is neither a reliable history of exposure nor a rapid diagnostic tool.",

Whether the genetic variations can produce different clinical manifestations remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the scoring system for SARS may be continuously modified to maintain its diagnostic reliability. Second, there were 2 patients who had coronavirus and bacterial infections (Acinetobacter sp and S pneumoniae). Mixed infection may produce confusing clinical pictures that reduce the accuracy of the scoring system for SARS in diagnosing SARS. Third, the scoring system for SARS is a clinical decision rule for suspected cases of SARS instead of a screening tool for the general population. The sensitivity and specificity of the scoring may be expected to be different in other patient populations with a different mixture of comorbidities or in the setting of outbreaks of other respiratory diseases, such as influenza.",

Our report revealed that the WHO criteria for probable cases had only 44% specificity for patients who met the WHO criteria for suspected cases. This means there ought to be at least 2.3-fold reservation of isolated facilities and medical costs if all probable cases were admitted to hospitals. The average expenditure for each case to complete the workup for the scoring system for SARS was approximately US$200 in our series, whereas the medical cost during admission was US$1,100 per day. Although the total expenditure of completing the scoring system for SARS for our 232 validating patients was approximately US$46,400, the method saved at least 72 unnecessary admissions or US$1,108,800 (if the average duration of admission was 14 days). In addition, the rapid screening tests for common viruses and legionella and pneumococcal urinary antigen testing in our protocol were mainly for confirmation of the final diagnosis to establish the validity of the scoring system for SARS. Our primary objective was to develop a scoring system that used only common laboratory and radiographic examinations available at most EDs instead of other rapid tests. In other words, if no rapid screening tests were available, the scoring system still worked well.",
