For instance, bias has been incorporated to algorithms for credit scoring, policing, hiring, and even in healthcare: an algorithm that was widely used to identify patients with complex health needs and triage resources to them was biased against black patients because it estimated health needs based on cost, but cost is lower for black than white patients because of disparate access to care. 1 The COVID-19 pandemic has provoked fears of medical resource shortages, and as a result a variety of scarce resource allocation algorithms have been developed at the hospital, state, and national levels. Fortunately, it appears unlikely that such rules will need to be implemented in the short term. However, with the significant uncertainty that continues about the potential course of the pandemic, and concerns regarding a \"second surge\", it is essential to use the time we have to carefully weigh the trade-offs in these policies, and ensure that they enact our best values. To this end, it is important to evaluate the potential for these rules to propagate racial bias, and prevent this if possible.",

            "text": "Maximizing lives saved calls for focusing on the probability of survival to hospital discharge, whereas maximizing life-years saved calls for explicit incorporation of life-expectancy. For example, consider a severely-ill young patient with no comorbid conditions and an older patient with several chronic medical problems who has milder acute illness. In this case, maximizing lives saved prioritizes the older patient, whereas maximizing life-years would prioritize the younger patient. There is active ethical debate over how to balance these two principles, and proposed allocation rules deal with this dilemma in strikingly different ways (Table 1 ). [2] [3] [4] One significant point of divergence is the emphasis that allocation rules place on chronic diseases, with some allocation scores ignoring medical history while others incorporate even moderate comorbidities, such as End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). [2] [3] [4] When chronic diseases are incorporated into allocation algorithms, the rationale for doing so is that they lower life expectancy, and therefore patients have fewer potential life-years to be saved from the resource. 2 Importantly, however, racial and ethnic minorities disproportionately bear chronic disease burdens, in terms of prevalence, control and complications, from conditions such as ESRD, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. For example, compared to white Americans, the risk of ESRD is 3.6 times higher among African-Americans and 2 times higher among Latinos. 5 Therefore, the more that comorbid chronic medical conditions are emphasized in priority scores, the higher the risk of systematically deprioritizing racial/ethnic minorities.",

First, there is wide variation in life expectancies within and between the \"example\" chronic medical conditions. Second, individuals who have no premorbid illness may develop disabilities and shorter lifeexpectancies as a result of critical illness, limiting the real-life years gained. Third, while guidelines give examples of chronic conditions that limit life expectancy, these lists are arbitrary and certainly not exhaustive, and in some cases have been removed (though triage personnel are still encouraged to consider comorbidities and life expectancy, with less concrete guidance). 2 As a result, the evaluation of chronic diseases will be subjective, which could introduce implicit biases that lead to de-prioritization of racial/ethnic minorities and other marginalized populations.",
