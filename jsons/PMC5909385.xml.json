The most common causes of CAP are Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus (S aureus) and Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae).

In addition to prevention strategies, treatment of influenza complications has also become available through antiviral and antibiotic therapies. The goal of combined therapies for prevention and treatment must surely be a reduction in the proportion of bacterial infections associated with influenza. However, the wider use of antibiotics for treatment of bacterial influenza needs to be considered alongside the corresponding requirement for appropriate use of antibiotics, in order to reduce the increasing burden of antibiotic resistance of bacterial strains implicated in co\u2010infection with influenza.",

Reports from past influenza pandemics show an extremely high frequency of lung colonisation by bacterial species that are commonly found in the nasopharynx. Most evidence suggests that virus\u2010induced changes in the respiratory tract prime the upper airway and lung for subsequent bacterial infection. Secondary bacterial infections are facilitated by virus\u2010induced cytopathology and resulting immunological impairment, which may be caused in part by the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines.6 Modification of the immune response either by diminishing the ability of the host to clear bacteria or by amplification of the inflammatory cascade is likely to contribute to the severity of the resulting infection.7 Animal studies using murine models have shown that influenza predisposes to bacterial pneumonia.6, 8, 9, 10 Lag times of 7\u201321 days have been calculated in studies for onset of bacterial infection following seasonal influenza11 although much shorter times from onset to death have been recorded in pandemic periods.12, 13, 14\n",

British and French army camps in 1916/17 were the initial setting for major outbreaks of purulent bronchitis associated with Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococcus, streptococcus and staphylococcus. Over a period of 2 months in 1918 at 37 large American army camps, secondary bacterial infection occurred in approximately 17% of those diagnosed with influenza of which approximately 35% were fatal.4 Oxford describes these army camp outbreaks as progenitors of the ensuing H1N1 pandemic of 1918.19 Overall, it has been estimated that in the US military, the mean influenza attack rate during the course of the 1918/1919 pandemic was 23%, the mean percentage of influenza cases that developed pneumonias was 16% and the mean percentage of pneumonia cases that were fatal was 34%.4 Recent re\u2010analyses of post\u2010mortem lung cultures from 1918 showed evidence of bacterial infection in >90% of the specimens.18, 20\n",

They suggest that the scale and range of bacterial invaders was random, and in the case of large group outbreaks, depended on the occurrence of particular bacteria in the respiratory tract of persons at the time of infection and on their occurrence in contacts. The fatal outcome of influenza pneumonia was therefore determined partly by virally depressed local and general pulmonary resistance and partly by the virulence and nature of the invading bacteria.12 Brundage explains the high transmission rates in military camps and other crowded settings as due to \u2018cloud adults\u2019 \u2013 affected persons who increased the aerosolisation of colonising strains of bacteria to other susceptible persons. Military personnel were deemed to be highly susceptible because of their closed community style living and their physically weakened state. In American civilian populations, attack rates and deaths were similar among younger adults and overall were approximately 28% for influenza with 30% of associated pneumonias being fatal.21 Studies also show that, in all age groups, deaths were strongly correlated with pneumonia cases than with influenza clinical cases alone. Children had the highest rates of clinical influenza infection, whereas young adults had the highest influenza pneumonia rates and associated fatality rates.20, 22, 23\n",

The 2009 pandemic first appeared in some countries during their normal seasonal activity. As a result, national virological surveillance schemes were able to demonstrate the emergence of the new H1N1 strain against a background and subsequent decline of circulating seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 strains.

Maxwell first noted that bacterial pneumonia could occur during interepidemic periods when sporadic cases of influenza were investigated.46 McCullers shows that from 1968 to 1999 excess deaths directly attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I deaths) from selected US cities data were more commonly associated with influenza A(H3N2) rather than H1N1 or influenza B infections.7 Meningococcal infections were observed to increase in the presence of both influenza A47, 48 and influenza B49, but no causal relationship was identified in a later study.50 In Sweden, pneumococcal infections were calculated to increase by 12\u201320% per influenza season over a ten\u2010year study period with a lag time of 1\u20133 weeks for pneumococcal disease following peaks in influenza incidence.11 In Canada, a recent observational study showed that the seasonality and time lag of pneumococcal disease was only partially related to influenza seasonality. Other factors such as reduced temperatures and daylight hours were important for the regular appearance of pneumococcal disease each winter. However, the study did find that influenza increased the risk of pneumococcal disease through enhancing pneumococcal invasion in colonised individuals, but had minimal impact on the transmission dynamics of pneumococcal infection.40 Transmission studies using animal models show increased incidence and severity of bacterial pneumonia after influenza infection is pneumococcal strain dependent. Different strains may increase the duration of pneumococcal carriage and enhance the bacterial pneumonia.10 In another study using infant mice, influenza virus was shown to be essential for pneumococcal transmission in a co\u2010housed group although other indirect effects by which the virus altered the immune response of the mice were also considered to be important reasons in the dynamics and synergism between influenza and pneumococcal infection.9 The introduction of a seven\u2010valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) for infants has been shown in the United States to lead to a reduction in pneumococcal infections in vaccinated children and in adults through herd immunity effects.51 A significant fall in influenza\u2010associated pneumonia hospitalisations was observed among vaccinated children and unvaccinated adults; the vaccine acted to prevent the secondary pneumococcal pneumonia that followed influenza infection.51 A nine\u2010valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PncCV) in South Africa was shown to prevent 31% of pneumonias associated with any of seven respiratory viruses in hospitalised children.

As a consequence, a wide range of less common pathogen pairings were encountered. In South Africa, co\u2010infection with HIV or active tuberculosis was a common finding among the investigated early fatal cases, signifying that these conditions could be associated with increased mortality risk.61 From a TB endemic area, it has been reported that an immunocompromised cancer patient was co\u2010infected with both TB and pandemic H1N1 \u2013 a rare finding.62 In Mexico, a study of 126 HIV patients with respiratory symptoms found that in the 30 patients co\u2010infected with pandemic H1N1 virus, illness opportunistic infections were more severe and involved longer hospital stays (P = 0\u00b70013), higher hospitalisation rates (P < 0\u00b70001) and increased deaths (P = 0\u00b7026). Deaths were also associated with delayed administration of oseltamivir (P = 0\u00b70022).63 In the United States, Hopkins et al. reported six cases of bacterial tracheitis (BT) that were isolated in conjunction with influenza A (H1N1). No previous H1N1 cases have presented as BT in the literature to date.64 Six cases of bacterial co\u2010infection due to Legionella pneumophila were reported from Italy; the authors commenting on the fact that bacterial co\u2010infections associated with the influenza A H1N1 pandemic have not been well described yet because of lack of data.65 The first case of Panton\u2010Valentine leukocidin (PVL) necrotising pneumonia due to influenza A (H1N1) and community\u2010acquired methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus was reported from Spain,66 the authors recommend that other clinicians become aware of this co\u2010infection. Similarly, co\u2010infection with dengue virus and pandemic influenza H1N1 is likely to be a feature in tropical countries where seasonal patterns of these two viruses were contemporaneous, as documented in a case report from Puerto Rico.67 During seasonal influenza activity in 2006, influenza A H3N2 infection was associated with a fatal paediatric case of Campylobacter jejuni infection in Malaysia.68 Co\u2010infection with Campylobacter spp. has not been previously described together with influenza virus.",

Control and prevention, through viral and bacterial vaccines, and prophylaxis and treatment, through the application of antiviral and antibiotic therapies all contribute to reducing the global burden of these infections. All of these measures however have limitations which impede their effectiveness. Antibiotic resistance has been recognised as a growing concern for many years and during the 2009 pandemic, an increasing number of oseltamivir\u2010resistant influenza strains were detected, particularly among immunocompromised patients with influenza infection.70, 71 Other threats to combating influenza epidemics or pandemics in the future might include timely production and administration of effective vaccines and logistical issues associated with stockpiling and distribution of antiviral and antibiotic drugs.42, 72\n",

In Sweden, influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines together reduced hospital admissions for influenza, pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease by 32, 22 and 54%, respectively. Overall mortality was also reduced by 27%.75 A study of prior influenza vaccination in relation to its effect on severity and mortality in patients with CAP during seasonal influenza periods showed that prevention of the predisposing viral illness reduced the risk for more severe secondary pneumonia. However, outside the influenza season, no significant influence of influenza vaccination status on CAP severity was found.76 Most of the subjects in this study were elderly and therefore in the risk group for influenza vaccination. Increasing the uptake of influenza vaccination in younger age groups could contribute to the overall prevention of influenza\u2010attributable pneumococcal disease either directly or through protection from influenza via herd effects on other individuals.40\n",

Given prophylactically, antivirals aid prevention of infection either in the absence of vaccine protection or within high\u2010risk groups and may also prevent transmission within closed communities or households. When used for treatment, observational studies have confirmed that oseltamivir given within 48 hours of symptom onset (the recommended time for maximum effectiveness) improves survival in patients with severe influenza and may reduce secondary bacterial infection.77 Of 70 paediatric deaths related to the 2009 pandemic and investigated in one study, 45 (64%) had received antiviral therapy but only seven (10%) within 48 hours of onset.14 21% of the deaths in this cohort occurred in healthy children.

Many of these deaths are preventable through immunisation, treatment and access to health care. The recent initiative of the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunisation, which supports global coverage of conjugate Hib and pneumococcal vaccines in childhood programmes, estimates that the incidence of severe pneumonia and associated mortality in children in developing countries may be reduced by 50% through this programme.69 However, other inequities are likely to persist between developed and developing countries with reference to access to adult respiratory vaccines, the ability to stockpile antivirals and antibiotics as part of pandemic planning and remain a major obstacle to global\u2010improved public health goals.",

Obviously, this simplistic approach overlooks the vast organisation of economic and human resources needed to achieve these outcomes, but nevertheless, they remain a public health goal.
