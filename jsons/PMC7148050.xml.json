Unfortunately, observing and identifying living organisms requires high levels of expertise. For instance, plants alone account for more than 400,000 different species and the distinctions between them can be quite subtle. Since the Rio Conference of 1992, this taxonomic gap has been recognized as one of the major obstacles to the global implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity [6]. In 2004, Gaston and O\u2019Neill [27] discussed the potential of automated approaches for species identification. They suggested that, if the scientific community were able to (i) produce large training datasets, (ii) precisely evaluate error rates, (iii) scale up automated approaches, and (iv) detect novel species, then it would be possible to develop a generic automated species identification system that would open up new vistas for research in biology and related fields.",

This area continues to expand rapidly, particularly due to recent advances in deep learning [25, 28, 31, 42, 45\u201347]. In order to measure progress in a sustainable and repeatable way, the LifeCLEF [15] research platform was created in 2014 as a continuation and extension of the plant identification task [37] that had been run within the ImageCLEF lab [12] since 2011 [32\u201334]. LifeCLEF expanded the challenge by considering animals in addition to plants, and including audio and video content in addition to images. LifeCLEF 2020 consists of four challenges (PlantCLEF, BirdCLEF, GeoLifeCLEF, and SnakeCLEF), which we will now describe in turn.",

These physical specimens are used to study the variability of species, their phylogenetic relationship, their evolution, or phenological trends. One of the key step in the workflow of botanists and taxonomists is to find the herbarium sheets that correspond to a new specimen observed in the field. This task requires a high level of expertise and can be very tedious. Developing automated tools to facilitate this work is thus of crucial importance. More generally, this will help to convert these invaluable centuries-old materials into FAIR [23] data.",

Birds are difficult to photograph and sound offers better possibilities for inventory coverage. A number of participatory science projects have focused on recording a very large number of bird sounds, making it possible to recognize most species by their sound and to train deep learning models to automate this process. It was shown in previous editions of BirdCLEF [35, 36] that systems for identifying birds from mono-directional recordings are now performing very well and several mobile applications implementing this are emerging today. However, there is also interest in identifying birds from omnidirectional or binaural recordings. This would enable more passive monitoring scenarios like networks of static recorders that continuously capture the surrounding sound environment. The advantage of this type of approach is that it introduces less sampling bias than the opportunistic observations of citizen scientists. However, recognizing birds in such content is much more difficult due to the high vocal activity with signal overlap (e.g. during the dawn chorus) and high levels of ambient noise.",

For the second task on stereophonic recordings, the goal will be to determine the species singing in chorus simultaneously during a time interval. In contrast to task one, the challengers are invited to run automatic source separation before or jointly to the bird species classification, taking advantage of the multi-channel recordings. Participants will be allowed to use any other data than the provided recordings, but will have to provide the scripts to check that their solution is fully automatic.

To fully reach its objective, an evaluation campaign such as LifeCLEF requires a long-term research effort so as to (i) encourage non-incremental contributions, (ii) measure consistent performance gaps, (iii) progressively scale-up the problem and (iv), enable the emergence of a strong community. The 2020 edition of the lab will support this vision and will include the following innovations:SnakeCLEF, a challenging new task related to the identification of snake species, will be introduced. It will be organized by the University of Geneva, Switzerland.The PlantCLEF task will focus on a brave new challenge: the identification of plant pictures based on a training set of digitized herbarium sheets (cross-domain image classification).The BirdCLEF challenge will be enriched with new annotated soundscape data, and with challenging new high sampling rate stereophonic recordings (from SEAMED, SMILES ANR, and SABIOD [21] projects).The GeoLifeCLEF challenge will be enriched with new plant and animal occurrences from two continents and high resolution remotely sensed imagery.\n",
