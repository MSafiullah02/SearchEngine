            "text": "Infusion reaction, also called cytokine release syndrome, is well described in the current literature and has led to the formulation of recommendations for rituximab administration in hematology-oncology patients. It has been reported in 4% [13, 14] , 14.6% [15] and 23% [16] of patients depending on the particular study and has especially been encountered during the first infusion of the drug. Usual mild infusion reactions include rash, hot flushes, dyspnea and pruritus [13] . Less common mild reactions may consist of dry throat feeling, palpitations, headaches, restless leg syndrome, chills, hypertension and fever. Severe cytokine release syndrome is infrequent (0.5%) [16] but can be lethal, with anaphylactoid reactions such as bronchospasm, angioedema, shock and hypoxemia [17] . Cardiogenic shock, myocardial infarction and ventricular fibrillation have been reported by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Fatal reactions may occur in 0.04-0.07% of patients [3] . Risk factors identified for a rituximab infusion reaction include: first infusion, large tumor burden or high levels of circulating B lymphocytes [15, 18, 19] . This toxicity has been ascribed to the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6 or other cytokines by B lymphocytes, following the binding of rituximab to CD20 [19] . To prevent these reactions, the FDA recommends slow infusion rates, especially for the first administration of rituximab (initial rate of 50 mg/h with an increase of 50 mg/h every 30 min, to a maximum of 400 mg/h unless signs of infusion reaction occur). Subsequent infusions can be accelerated to 100 mg/h increasing to 400 mg/h by steps of 100 mg/h every 30 min. Recent protocols with 90-minute infusion rates do not seem to increase the incidence of infusion reactions in previously treated patients [13, 15, 19, 20] . Moreover, premedication with antihistamine, steroids and acetaminophen prior to rituximab infusion is often sufficient to prevent infusion reactions [13] .",

Although tumor lysis syndrome is a well-described complication of chemotherapy for aggressive lymphoma, it has not been frequently reported in patients treated with rituximab. Only a few cases have been reported in the literature. In these cases, it is noteworthy that the tumor lysis syndrome occurred in the context of high burden lymphoproliferative disorders (bulky lymphadenopathies or high white blood cell [WBC] count) [22] . Mortality rate was high since 4/8 patients died from the tumor lysis syndrome [23, 24] .

Although P. jirovecii pneumonia has been largely attributed to CD4+ lymphocyte immunosuppression, as usually seen in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, B cells and antibodies seem to be involved in the host defense against this fungal infection [40] . Until recently, it was not clear whether rituximab actually increased the risk for P. jirovecii pneumonia or not, because patients on anti-CD20 therapy frequently also receive chemotherapy and steroids (increasing per se the risk of P. jirovecii pneumonia) and/or co-trimoxazole prophylaxis (decreasing the risk of P. jirovecii) [26] . Nonetheless, a recent meta-analysis showed a higher risk of P. jirovecii under rituximab therapy in patients treated by polychemotherapy and steroids for lymphoma. The incidence was 28/942 (3%) with rituximab versus 5/977 (0.5%) without rituximab. The relative risk of P. jirovecii pneumonia with rituximab is estimated to be 3.65 (IC95% = 0.09-0.94). No case has been described under prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole [41] . In a case series of 30 patients who developed P. jirovecii pneumonia under rituximab, 10% had no lymphoma but auto-immune diseases (immune thrombocytopenia, rheumatoid arthritis or granulomatosis with polyangeitis). Moreover, 10% occurred under rituximab alone [40] . P. jirovecii pneumonia occurred with a median delay of 77 days after the final rituximab infusion. For the 10 patients with available data, low CD4+ lymphocyte levels were found. The manifestations were serious, as 88.5% of patients had criteria for ARDS and 30% died.",

This opportunistic infection is usually observed in advanced stages of HIV infection, but has also been described in lymphoid neoplasms, and following immunosuppressive drugs, such as rituximab [42] . JCV is a ubiquitous doublestranded DNA virus [43] . Its seroprevalence is estimated at around 80-90% and asymptomatic primary infection occurs in childhood in 75% of the cases. The virus then remains latent in the kidney and mononuclear immune cells [26] . PML is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), occurring when JCV reactivation occurs in the context of lymphoid depletion. The spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with PML includes confusion, motor weakness, ataxia, aphasia, visual symptoms [44] . These manifestations usually progress over weeks to months. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) usually shows multifocal areas of subcortical and periventricular white matter demyelination. These lesions typically predominate in the parieto-occipital territory. They are hypointense in T1-weighted sequences, not enhanced after gadolinium injection, and hyperintense in T2-weighted sequences. JCV detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has an estimated sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 92% in patients with acquired immunodeficiency disease (AIDS) [45] . In a series of 57 cases of rituximab-associated PML in non-AIDS patients, JCV was found in the CSF of only 54% of the cases [44] . If there is a high suspicion of PML with a negative PCR, brain biopsy must be performed [42] . No treatment has been shown to be effective except for immune restoration whenever possible.

In highly sensitized renal transplant recipients, rituximab did not increase the risk of bacterial infections, compared to other immunosuppressive regimens in a retrospective study [65, 66] . However, when rituximab is used as maintenance monotherapy in indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the risk of severe bacterial infections increases, with one report noting that 19% developed bacterial infections and 1-4% grade III-IV infections [3] . Meta-analyses report a relative risk between 1.67 and 2.85 for the risk of bacterial infections and of 3.55 for grade III-IV infections [8, 67] .",

The hypothesis that late-onset neutropenia could be due to a defect of granulopoiesis linked to a competition with intra-medullary B lymphopoiesis has been voiced. This hypothesis was sustained by more intense B-cell activating factor (BAFF) elevation in patients with late-onset neutropenia [69, 73] . Other authors have hypothesized that late-onset neutropenia could be due to autoantibody production against neutrophils progenitors [74, 75] . Finally, large granular lymphocyte proliferation was observed in several patients with rituximab-induced late-onset neutropenia [26, 68] . This could explain lateonset neutropenia as large granular lymphocyte oligoclonal proliferation is known to induce neutropenia [76] .",

Therefore, the exposed population is large and increasing, making these toxic events likely to present in our ICUs. Critical care specialists must be aware of the drug's different potentially serious adverse effects, which may occur immediately, or short-or long-term after rituximab infusion, depending on the mechanism of toxicity. The toxicity of more recently released anti-CD20 antibodies is less known. Nonetheless, ofatumumab (used in CLL) or obinutuzumab (used in both CLL and follicular lymphoma) seem to share toxicities with rituximab (e.g., infusion reaction, late cytopenia, progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy or HBV reactivation [82] ), prompting careful surveillance of patients receiving new anti-CD20 antibodies.",
