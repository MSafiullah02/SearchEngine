The prevalence of NoV is highest in developing countries (Lanata et al. 2013). The extremely contagious virus affects individuals of all ages, but young children and the elderly remain the most vulnerable groups (Glass et al. 2009). An annual incidence rate in England as high as 34 consultations/1000 person-years in children younger than five years has been reported, thereby confirming the unequivocal vulnerability of this group to NoV infections (Verstraeten et al. 2017).",

            "text": "The infection usually lasts only a few days and subsides without any lasting damage, but symptoms, such as diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, stomach pain, headache, and in certain cases also fever, may persist longer in young children, elderly and in immunocompromised individuals (Roddie et al. 2009), whereby a NoV infection may be fatal for the latter group (Schwartz et al. 2011). Humans remain the only known reservoir for transmission, which occurs mostly oral-faecal (e.g. by contact of the hands with contaminated areas) and vomit-oral (by the oral intake of droplets containing the virus): \u201cThis explains the very rapid spread of infection within nursing homes, hospitals and community facilities\u201d (RKI 2019a). Direct person-to-person transmission, food, water and environmental fomites have been identified as the predominant transmission routes. Since the infection only occurs in humans, the virus is ultimately transmitted from person-to-person (Lopman et al. 2015). Noroviruses of genogroup (GG) II have been the predominant strains within recent years (Pringle et al. 2015). GG 2 genotype 4 (GGII.4) strains seem to be associated with significantly higher hospitalisation and mortality rates (Desai et al. 2012). It was demonstrated in an early study that NoV infected individuals develop a temporary immunity of about 6\u201314 weeks after a contact with the virus (Parrino et al. 1977), whereas a recent study points towards a longer protection that may last for several years (Simmons et al. 2013). Several factors, such as an incomplete understanding of the immunity against NoV hamper current efforts aiming at developing a vaccine against NoV (Atmar et al. 2011; Riddle and Walker 2016; Cortes-Penfield et al. 2017; Lucero et al. 2018).",

            "text": "Despite the visibly high burden of NoV worldwide, it is worth noting that official statistics are not representative. Indeed, a considerable underestimation of the true incidence must be assumed due to a disproportion between symptomatic persons, laboratory testing and notification of cases to official data registers (Tam et al. 2012; Bernard et al. 2014c). In Germany, for example, NoV gastroenteritis is a notifiable disease since 2001 according to the Protection against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz) (RKI 2019a). A notification to the federal public health authority is mandatory in the case of at least two affected persons and causal epidemic assumptions, in the case of at least one affected person working in the food processing sector, and for children under 6 years who acquired the infection in childcare institutions. Nationwide surveillance data is available in an electronic database at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the public health institute on disease surveillance, control and prevention (Bernard et al. 2014b). Considering that only laboratory-confirmed cases have to be reported to the RKI since 2011 (RKI 2011), it raises the question as to whether later statistics of the RKI are representative. In an overview of the number of cases of notifiable diseases in 2017, the RKI itself acknowledges that their reported number of NoV cases may be misleading (RKI 2018).",

            "text": "During NoV outbreaks in health care facilities, staff members are often affected, leading to severe staff shortages, temporary closure of wards (Harris et al. 2014) and, ultimately, economic losses (Zingg et al. 2005). Individual studies indicate a heterogeneous pattern regarding the proportion of sick employees during NoV outbreaks. A review of more than 70 NoV outbreaks in five different hospitals in Germany showed, for example, that 24% of the 1432 persons with clinical symptoms were employees (Mattner et al. 2015). Other studies indicate that the number of affected health care workers (HCWs) during hospital outbreaks may even exceed the number of affected patients, thereby leading to a serious burden for staff (Meyer et al. 2004; Mattner et al. 2006; Sideroglou et al. 2014; Schulz-St\u00fcbner et al. 2016). The high proportion of sick employees in hospital outbreaks may be partly explained by the fact that a specialised hygiene team develops infection control measures in most German hospitals, whereas the health of personnel belongs to the scope of occupational health physicians. Secondly, HCWs are at higher risk due to environmental contamination (Lopman et al. 2012). As shown in an own recent study (Michaelis et al. 2017), the latter group receives usually very little information about the number of sick employees and is thus often not actively involved in the outbreak management. Hence, it is anticipated that the lack of cooperation between the occupational health physicians and the specialised hygiene team may lead to a higher number of cases among HCWs in hospitals.",

For example, each person was considered a NoV case who experienced diarrhea and/or vomiting in a cohort study (Vo et al. 2016), whereas nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramping, fever (\u2265 38 \u00b0C), muscle pain, headache or multiple of these symptoms were regarded as indicative for a NoV infection in another study (Johansson et al. 2002).",

Indeed, a ratio derived for aggregated data simply reflects the total proportion of sick staff in the whole dataset. However, this number does not provide any information about the variation of the proportion of sick staff during every single outbreak in the dataset. Therefore, it may be possible that an average ratio for whole dataset masks a strong variation in the proportion of sick staff.

The review highlights a different proportion of sick staff relative to the total number of affected persons. We hypothesise that these differences are due to different management strategies during NoV outbreaks and a subjectively different experience of the symptoms of a NoV gastroenteritis. This leads to the situation that infectious staff stays away from work for varying lengths of time. Presenteeism may considerably contribute to negative outcomes of NoV outbreaks. An evaluation of the effect of different management strategies on the outcome of NoV outbreaks is beyond the scope of the present study. See, for example, the case study of Vivancos et al. (2010) summarised below for an analysis of the impact of different management strategies on the outcome of NoV outbreaks.",

A NoV infection among an immunocompetent subject subsides usually after several days without any remaining damage (Pringle et al. 2015) and most employees are able to restart their work after having recovered (Michaelis et al. 2017). Therefore, NoV should not be considered an occupational disease of major importance. This is also reflected in the data of the German statutory accident insurances between 1991 and 2013, in which NoV gastroenteritis was represented with one single case (oral reference to the statistics of infectious diseases, no. 3101, in the \u2018Documentation of occupational diseases in Germany\u2019 database available at https://www.gbe-bund.de (last access: 12 November 2019). As only every fifth person suffering from NoV gastroenteritis was an employee, and that NoV outbreaks in hotels, restaurants, canteens and related settings rarely affected staff, suggest a negligible impact of NoV. On the other hand, more than 50% of the NoV cases during 13 out of 43 outbreaks in health care facilities were employees and those staff members accounted for 34.9% of the NoV cases during community facility outbreaks, it is fair to conclude that NoV should be regarded, from a quantitative perspective, as an important occupational disease in these settings. This is also supported by an earlier study of us. Based on register data from Lower Saxony, we showed that the incidence of NoV among HCWs was significantly higher relative to the incidence of NoV in the total population (Hofmann et al. 2018).",

Considering that the etiological agent of gastroenteritis often remains unspecified, underreporting-related biases in our dataset cannot be excluded. Therefore, we stress that all numbers in this paper should be considered carefully. It can be anticipated that underreporting is particularly high in food establishments since the owners of such facilities seek to avoid negative publicity associated with NoV outbreaks and subsequent economic losses. Therefore, it is likely that NoV cases among food handlers often do not show up in official statistics relative to NoV infectious customers.",

Considering the significantly higher proportion of sick staff during outbreaks in health care and community facilities, it is anticipated that revenue losses due to NoV outbreaks are highest in these settings. It should be noted that the presumably higher revenue losses in community and health care facilities also stem from the fact that the number of employees at risk is significantly higher than in food establishments where the number of employees is usually low.",

Due to this disproportionality, the ratio between the number of sick staff and the total number of NoV infectious persons should always be close to zero, irrespective of the attack rate among staff. Even a pronounced NoV outbreak leading to an attack rate of 100% among a small group of staff would yield a ratio close to zero. This reasoning suggests that (1) the derived ratios for NoV outbreaks in such facilities should not be regarded as meaningful and that (2) they should not be compared with that of hospital outbreaks, where the size of both groups at risk (HCWs and patients) is usually less disproportional. Considering that the attack rate only reveals information about the proportion of sick persons relative to the total number in a certain group and not about the size of the group itself, the attack rate should also be regarded as an insufficient proxy for the assessment of the burden of NoV.",

As only about 5% of the NoV cases in this group of outbreaks pertain to the personnel, it is deduced that outbreaks of NoV gastroenteritis do not represent a serious problem for the staff themselves, but for persons who are exposed to NoV-contaminated food. Therefore, it should be borne in mind for the design of suitable prevention strategies that they should mainly aim at preventing the spread of NoV from infectious food handlers. Accordingly, an increasing compliance of exclusion policies for NoV-infectious kitchen workers would thus be desirable.",

Indeed, a NoV outbreak affecting altogether 52 customers of a canteen would probably have been prevented if the infectious kitchen worker, who was the index case of a NoV outbreak (Schimmelpfennig et al. 2009), would have complied with \u00a742 of the Protection Against Infection act. Therefore, additional incentives are required to increase the compliance of existing regulations. It could be helpful, for example, to offer foodstuff-processing companies compensation fees for the revenue losses associated with the compliance of exclusion policies. Infectious persons could also be assigned to duties other than food handling during a NoV infection, as suggested earlier (Patel et al. 2009), although the complete exclusion of NoV infectious staff remains the most effective strategy for the prevention of NoV outbreaks (Duret et al. 2017).",

Furthermore, we observed that the attack rate was rarely reported in the original publications.

According to the vaccination recommendations of the German Permanent Vaccination Commission (STIKO) at the RKI (RKI 2019b), we propose to discuss the relevance of a possible NoV vaccine for the following professional groups:employees in health care institutions, including kitchen, laboratory, technical, ambulance and cleaning staff;personnel in community facilities (e.g., residential homes, children's day-care centers, children's homes, schools, workshops for disabled persons, asylum-seekers' homes) including kitchen and cleaning staff;food handlers in restaurants, canteens or hotels to prevent NoV cases among their customers.

Thus, the reduction of the considerable economic impact of NoV should be regarded as the main motivation to increase the compliance with existing hygiene precautions. At the same time, the ubiquitous economic pressure on employees needs to be reduced to ensure a compliance with existing exclusion policies.Staff in health care and community facilities seems to be most vulnerable towards NoV outbreaks, whereas NoV cases among food handlers are relatively rare. This pattern is mainly attributed to a comparably higher number of employees in health care and community settings. NoV should thus be regarded as important occupational disease for staff in the former group of settings.Regarding the prevention of NoV outbreaks, we strongly advocate the implementation of additional precautions, such as dedicated personnel concepts for NoV outbreaks, to increase the compliance with existing prevention strategies as exclusion policies. The resulting costs should always be viewed relative to significantly higher expenses associated with uncontrolled NoV outbreaks.A NoV vaccine would be most beneficial for HCWs that are continuously exposed to NoV infectious persons and for food handlers that may contribute to a significant spread of NoV among larger groups of persons.Underreporting-related biases can be regarded as the main limitations of this study and prevent a more precise assessment of the true burden of NoV. We argue that the determination of underreporting factors may only partly resolve this issue. Hence, the estimation of underreporting of NoV cases remains a challenge.",
