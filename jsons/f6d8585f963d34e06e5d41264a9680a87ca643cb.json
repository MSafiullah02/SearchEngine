These organisms reside in the living tissues of the host plant and do so in a variety of relationships, ranging from symbiotic to pathogenic. Endophytes may contribute to their host plant by producing a plethora of substances that provide protection and survival value to the plant. Ultimately, these compounds, once isolated and characterized, may also have potential for use in modern medicine. Novel antibiotics, antimycotics, immunosuppressants, and anticancer compounds are only a few examples of what has been found after the isolation and culturing of individual endophytes followed by purification and characterization of some of their natural products. The potential of finding new drugs that may be effective candidates for treating newly developing diseases in humans is great.",

Alkaloids synthesized by this fungus in its grass hosts have been implicated in fescue toxicosis in rangeland animals (1) . The chemistry and biology of this and other grass endophytes are reviewed elsewhere (2) . Unfortunately, because this work is so comprehensive, one may be led to the conclusion that endophytes produce toxic compounds only in their respective hosts and hold no promise for any medicinal applications whatsoever (2) . It turns out that this is simply not the case. As endophytes are examined from a plethora of sources, an overwhelming number have been found to produce natural products with promising potential for medicinal applications.",

The majority of the report discusses rationale for study, methods used, and examples of a number of endophytes isolated and studied in the authors' laboratories over the course of many years.

This search is driven by the development of resistance in infectious microorganisms (e.g., Staphylococcus, Mycobacterium, Streptococcus) to existing drugs and by the menacing presence of naturally resistant organisms. The ingress to the human population of new disease-causing agents such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), Ebola, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) requires the discovery and development of new drugs to combat them. Not only do diseases such as AIDS require drugs that target them specifically, but new therapies are needed for treating ancillary infections, which are a consequence of a weakened immune system. Furthermore, others who are immunocompromised (e.g., cancer and organ transplant patients) are at risk of infection by opportunistic pathogens, such as Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, and Candida, which normally are not major problems in the human population. In addition, more drugs are needed to efficiently treat parasitic protozoan and nematodal infections such as malaria, leishmaniasis, trypanomiasis, and filariasis. Malaria by itself is more effective in claiming lives each year than any other single infectious agent with the exception of AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) (3) . However, the enteric diseases claim the most lives each year of any disease complex, and unfortunately, the victims are mostly children (3) .",

Accordingly, it appears that the search for novel secondary metabolites should center on organisms that inhabit unique biotopes. Thus, it behooves the investigator to carefully study and select the biological source before proceeding, rather than to take a totally random approach in selecting the source material. Careful study also indicates that organisms and their biotopes that are subjected to constant metabolic and environmental interactions should produce even more secondary metabolites (5) . Endophytes are microbes that inhabit such biotopes, namely higher plants, which is why they are currently considered as a wellspring of novel secondary metabolites offering the potential for exploitation of their medical benefits.",

Bacon et al. give an inclusive and widely accepted definition of endophytes: \"Microbes that colonize living, internal tissues of plants without causing any immediate, overt negative effects\" (2) . While the symptomless nature of endophyte occupation in plant tissue has prompted focus on symbiotic or mutualistic relationships between endophytes and their hosts, the observed biodiversity of endophytes suggests they can also be aggressive saprophytes or opportunistic pathogens. Both fungi and bacteria are the most common microbes existing as endophytes. It would seem that other microbial forms most certainly exist in plants as endophytes, such as mycoplasmas, rickettsia, and archebacteria; however, no evidence for them has yet been presented. The most frequently isolated endophytes are the fungi (7) . It turns out that the vast majority of plants have not been studied for their endophytes. Thus, enormous opportunities exist for the recovery of novel fungal forms, including genera, biotypes, as well as species in the myriad of plants yet to be studied. Hawksworth and Rossman estimated there may be as many as 1 million different fungal species, yet only approx 100,000 have been described (8) . As more evidence accumulates, estimates keep rising as to the actual number of fungal species. For instance, Dreyfuss and Chapela estimate there may be at least 1 million species of endophytic fungi alone (9) . It seems obvious that endophytes are a rich and reliable source of genetic diversity and may represent previously undescribed species. Finally, in our experience, novel microbes (as defined at the morphological and/or molecular levels) often have novel natural products associated with them. This fact alone helps eliminate the problems of dereplication in compound discovery.",

For example, an aquatic plant, Rhyncholacis penicillata, was collected from a river system in southwest Venezuela where the harsh aquatic environment subjected the plant to constant beating by virtue of rushing waters, debris, and tumbling rocks and pebbles (11) . These environmental insults created many portals through which common phytopathogenic oomycetes could enter the plant. Still, the plant population appeared to be healthy, possibly owing to protection by an endophytic product. This was the environmental biological clue used to pick this plant for a comprehensive study of its endophytes. Eventually, an unusual and potent antifungal strain of Serratia marcescens, living both as an epiphyte and an endophyte, was recovered from R. penicillata. This bacterium was shown to produce oocydin A, a novel antioomycetous compound having the properties of a chlorinated macrocyclic lactone ( Fig. 1) (11) . It is conceivable that the production of oocydin A by S. marcescens is directly related to the endophyte's relationship with its higher-plant host. Currently, oocydin A is being considered for agricultural use to control the ever-threatening presence of oomyceteous fungi such as Pythium spp. and Phytophthora spp. Oocydin A also has activity against a number of rapidly dividing cancer cell lines (11) .",

For example, a sample of the snakevine, Kennedia nigriscans, from the Northern Territory of Australia, was selected for study since its sap has traditionally been used as bush medicine for many millenia. In fact, this area was selected for plant sampling because it has been home to the world's longest standing civilization-the Australian aborigines. The snakevine is harvested, crushed, and heated in an aqueous brew by local aborigines in southwest Arnhemland to treat cuts, wounds, and infections. As it turned out, the plant contained a streptomycete that possessed unique partial 16S rDNA sequences when compared to those in GenBank. The organism was designated Streptomyces NRRL 30562, and it produces broad-spectrum novel peptide antibiotics called munumbicins, which are discussed below (12) . It seems likely that some of the healing properties in plants, as discovered by indigenous peoples, might be facilitated by compounds produced by one or more specific plant-associated endophytes as well as the plant products themselves.",

Tropical and temperate rainforests are the most biologically diverse terrestrial ecosystems on earth. The most threatened of these spots cover only 1.44% of the land's surface, yet they harbor over 60% of the world's terrestrial biodiversity (10) . In addition, each of the 20-25 areas identified as supporting the world's greatest biodiversity support unusually high levels of plant endemism (10) . As such, one would expect, with high plant endemism, there also should exist specific endophytes that may have evolved with the endemic plant species. Biological diversity implies chemical diversity, because of the constant chemical innovation that is required to survive in ecosystems where the evolutionary race to survive is most active. Tropical rainforests are a remarkable example of this type of environment. Competition is great, resources are limited, and selection pressure is at its peak. This gives rise to a high probability that rainforests are a source of novel molecular structures and biologically active compounds (14) .",

Thus, more background information on a given plant species and its microorganismal biology would be exceedingly helpful in directing the search for bioactive products. Presently, no one is quite certain of the role of endophytes in nature and their relationship to various host plant species. Although some endophytic fungi appear to be ubiquitous (e.g., Fusarium spp., Pestalotiopsis spp., and Xylaria spp.), one cannot definitively state that endophytes are truly host-specific or even systemic within plants, any more than one can assume that their associations are chance encounters. Frequently, many endophytes of the same species are isolated from the same plant, and only one or a few biotypes of a given fungus will produce a highly biologically active compound in culture (19) . A great deal of uncertainty also exists between what an endophyte produces in culture and what it may produce in nature. It does seem possible that the production of certain bioactive compounds by the endophyte in situ may facilitate the domination of its biological niche within the plant or even provide protection to the plant from harmful invading pathogens. Furthermore, little information exists relative to the biochemistry and physiology of the interactions of the endophyte with its host plant. It would seem that many factors changing in the host, related to the season, age, environment, and location, may influence the biology of the endophyte. Indeed, further research at the molecular level must be conducted in the field to study endophyte interactions and ecology. All of these interactions are probably chemically mediated for some purpose in nature. An ecological awareness of the role these organisms play in nature will provide the best clues for targeting particular types of endophytic bioactivity with the greatest potential for bioprospecting.",

After several days of incubation, hyphal tips of the fungi are removed and transferred to potato dextrose or other suitable agar. Bacterial forms also emerge from the plant tissues, including, on rare occasions, certain Streptomyces spp. The endophytes are encouraged to sporulate on specific plant materials and are eventually identified via standard morphological and molecular biological techniques and methods. Eventually, when an endophyte is acquired in pure culture, it is tested for its ability to be grown in shake or still culture using various media and growth conditions (21) . It is also immediately placed in storage under various conditions including 15% glycerol at -70\u00b0C.

They have been reported from every continent including the Antarctic. Some of these species produce phytotoxic compounds as well as antibiotics. The ecomycins are produced by Pseudomonas viridiflava (36) . This bacterium is generally associated with the leaves of many grass species and is located on and within the tissues (36) . The ecomycins represent a family of novel lipopeptides and have masses of 1153 and 1181. Besides common amino acids such as alanine, serine, threonine, and glycine, some nonprotein amino acids are incorporated into the structure of the ecomycins, including homoserine and \u03b2-hydroxyaspartic acid (36) . The ecomycins are active against such human pathogenic fungi as Cryptococcus neoformans and C. albicans. The pseudomycins produced by a plant-associated pseudomonad are another group of antifungal peptides (37, 38) . They are active against a variety of plant and human pathogenic fungi, including Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and a variety of plant pathogenic fungi, including Ceratocystis ulmi (the Dutch Elm disease pathogen) and Mycosphaerella fijiensis (causal agent of Black Sigatoka disease in bananas). The pseudomycins are cyclic depsipeptides formed by acylation of the OH group of the N-terminal serine with the terminal carboxyl group of L-chlorothreonine. Variety in this family of compounds is imparted via N-acetylation by one of a series of fatty acids, including 3,4-dihydroxydecanoate, 3-hydroxy-tetradecanoate (38) . The pseudomycins contain several nontraditional amino acids, including L-chlorothreonine, L-hydroxyaspartic acid, and both D-and L-diaminobutryic acid. The molecules are candidates for use in human medicine, especially after structural modification by chemical synthesis has successfully eliminated mammalian toxicity (39) The pseudomycins are also effective against a number of ascomycetous fungi, and are being considered for agricultural use for the control of the Black Sigatoka disease in bananas (Strobel, unpublished).",

This xylariaceaous (non-spore producing) fungus effectively inhibits and kills certain fungi and bacteria by producing a mixture of volatile compounds (47) . The majority of these compounds have been identified by gas chromatography (GC)/MS, synthesized or acquired, and then formulated into an artificial mixture. This mixture not only mimicked the antibiotic effects of the volatile compounds produced by the fungus, but also was used to confirm the identity of the majority of the volatiles emitted by this organism (47) . Each of the five classes of volatile compounds produced by the fungus had some microbial effects against the test fungi and bacteria, but none was lethal. However, they acted synergistically to cause death in a broad range of plant and human pathogenic fungi and bacteria. The most effective class of inhibitory compounds was the esters, of which isoamyl acetate was the most biologically active. The composition of the medium on which M. albus grows dramatically influences the kind of volatile compounds that are produced (48) . The ecological implications and potential practical benefits of the \"mycofumigation\" effects of M. albus are very promising, given the fact that soil fumigation utilizing methyl bromide will soon be illegal in the United States. Methyl bromide is not only a hazard to human health, but it has been implicated in causing destruction of the ozone layer. The potential use of mycofumigation to treat soil, seeds, and plants may soon be a reality. The artificial mixture of volatile compounds may also have usefulness in treating seeds, fruits, and plant parts in storage and while being transported. Muscodor albus already has a limited market for the treatment of human wastes. Its gases have both inhibitory and lethal effects on such fecal-inhabiting organisms as Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholera.",

Taxol (Fig. 7) , a highly functionalized diterpenoid, is found in each of the world's yew (Taxus) species, but was originally isolated from Taxus brevifolia (50) . The original targets for this compound were ovarian and breast cancers, but now it is used to treat a number of other human tissue proliferating diseases as well. The presence of taxol in yew species prompted the study of their endophytes. By the early 1990s, however, no endophytic fungi had been isolated from any of the world's representative yew species. After several years of effort, a novel taxol-producing endophytic fungus, Taxomyces andreanae, was discovered in Taxus brevifolia (13) . The most critical line of evidence for the presence of taxol in the culture fluids of this fungus was the electrospray mass spectrum of the putative taxol isolated from T. andreanae. In electrospray mass spectroscopy, taxol usually gives two peaks-one at mass 854, which is M+H + , and the other at 876, which is M+Na + . Fungal taxol had a mass spectrum identical to authentic taxol (16) . Then, 14 C labeling studies showed the presence of fungal-derived taxol in the culture medium (26) . This early work set the stage for a more comprehensive examination of the ability of other Taxus species and many other plants to yield endophytes producing taxol.",

One of the most frequently isolated endophytic species is Pestalotiopsis microspora (17) . An examination of the endophytes of Taxus wallichiana yielded P. microspora, and a preliminary monoclonal antibody test indicated that it might produce taxol (20) . After preparative TLC, a compound was isolated and shown by spectroscopic techniques to be taxol. Labeled ( 14 C) taxol was produced by this organism from several 14 C precursors (20) . Furthermore, several other P. microspora isolates that produce taxol were obtained from a bald cypress tree in South Carolina (19) . This was the first indication that endophytes, residing in plants other than Taxus spp., produce taxol. Therefore, a specific search was conducted for taxolproducing endophytes on continents not known for any indigenous Taxus spp., e.g., South America and Australia. From the extremely rare, and previously thought to be Fig. 7 . Taxol, the world's first billion-dollar anticancer drug, is produced by many endophytic fungi. It too, possesses outstanding anti-oomycete activity. extinct, Wollemi pine (Wollemia nobilis), Pestalotiopsis guepini was isolated, which was shown to produce taxol (51) . Also, quite surprisingly, a rubiaceous plant, Maguireothamnus speciosus, yielded a novel fungus, Seimatoantlerium tepuiense, that produces taxol. This endemic plant grows on the top of the tepuis in the Venzuelan-Guyana border in southwest Venezuela (52) . Furthermore, fungal taxol production has also been noted in Periconia sp. (53) and Seimatoantlerium nepalense, another novel endophytic fungal species (54) . Simply, it appears that the distribution of taxol-making fungi is worldwide and is not confined to endophytes of yews. The ecological and physiological explanation for fungi making taxol seems to be related to the fact that taxol is a fungicide, and the organisms most sensitive to it are plant pathogens such as Pythium spp. and Phytophthora spp. (55) . These pythiaceous organisms are some of the world's most important plant pathogens and are strong competitors with endophytic fungi for niches within plants. In fact, their sensitivity to taxol is based on their interaction with tubulin, in an identical manner as in rapidly dividing human cancer cells (55) . Thus, bona fide endophytes may be producing taxol and related taxanes to protect their respective host plant from degradation and disease caused by these pathogens.",

Many of these compounds possess antitumor and antibiotic activities, but because of their cellular toxicity they have not been developed into pharmaceuticals. Three novel cytochalasins have recently been reported from Rhinocladiella sp., as an endophyte on Tripterygium wilfordii. These compounds have antitumor activity and have been identified as 22-oxa- [12] -cytochalasins (61) . Thus, it is not uncommon to find one or more cytochalasins in endophytic fungi, and this provides an example of the fact that redundancy in discovery does occur, making dereplication an issue even for these under-investigated sources.",

Both pestacin and isopestacin display antimicrobial as well as antioxidant activity. Isopestacin was attributed with antioxidant activity based on its structural similarity to the flavonoids (Fig. 9) . Electron spin resonance spectroscopy confirmed this antioxidant activity; the compound is able to scavenge superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals in solution (62) . Pestacin was later described from the same culture fluid, occurring naturally as a racemic mixture and also possessing potent antioxidant activity (Fig. 10) (63) . The proposed antioxidant activity of pestacin arises primarily via cleavage of an unusually reactive C-H bond and, to a lesser extent, through O-H abstraction (63) . The antioxidant activity of pestacin is at least one order of magnitude more potent than that of trolox, a vitamin E derivative (63).",

Although the complete answer to this question is not at hand, relevant genetic studies have been performed on this organism. P. microspora Ne 32 is one of the most easily genetically transformable fungi that have been studied to date. In vivo addition of telomeric repeats to foreign DNA generates extrachromosomal DNAs in this fungus (66) . Repeats of the telomeric sequence 5'-TTAGGG-3' were appended to nontelomeric transforming DNA termini. The new DNAs, carrying foreign genes and the telomeric repeats, replicated independently of the chromosome and expressed the information carried by the foreign genes. The addition of telomeric repeats to foreign DNA is unusual among fungi. This finding may have important implications in the biology of P. microspora Ne 32, because it explains at least one mechanism as to how new DNA can be captured by this organism and eventually expressed and replicated. Such a mechanism may begin to explain how the enormous biochemical variation may have arisen in this fungus (19) . Also, this initial work represents a framework to aid in the understanding of how this fungus may adapt itself to the environment of its plant hosts and suggests that the uptake of plant DNA into its own genome may occur. In addition, the telomeric repeats have the same sequence as human telomeres, and this points to the possibility that P. microspora may serve as a means to make artificial human chromosomes, a totally unexpected result.",

The total land mass of the world that currently supports rainforests is about equal to the area of the United States (10) . Each year, an area the size of Vermont or greater is lost to clearing, harvesting, fire, agricultural development, mining, or other human-oriented activities (10) . Presently, it is estimated that only a small fraction (10-20%) of what were the original rainforests existing 1000-2000 yr ago, are currently present on the earth (10). The advent of major negative pressures on them from these human-related activities appears to be eliminating entire mega-life forms at an alarming rate. Few have ever expressed information or opinions about what is happening to the potential loss of microbial diversity as entire plant species disappear. It can only be guessed that this loss is also happening, perhaps at the same frequency as the loss of mega-life forms, especially because certain microorganisms may have developed unique specific symbiotic relationships with their plant hosts. Thus, when a plant species disappears, so too does its entire suite of associated endophytes and consequently all of the capabilities that they might possess to make natural products with medicinal potential. Multistep processes are needed now to secure information and life forms before they are lost. Areas of the planet that represent unique places housing biodiversity need immediate preservation. Countries need to establish information bases of their biodiversity and at the same time begin to make national collections of microorganisms that live in these areas. Endophytes are only one example of a life-form source that holds enormous promise to impact many aspects of human existence. The problem of the loss of biodiversity should be one of concern to the entire world.",
