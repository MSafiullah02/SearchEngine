APMV is internalized through phagocytosis76 before its genome-containing internal core is released through the 'stargate' into the cytoplasm, through the fusion of viral and phagosome membranes; transcription may be initiated in these cores77. Subsequently, the genome is released from the core and is replicated at high levels, which generates an early cytoplasmic replicative centre that is thought to be engulfed by a membrane layer of the endoplasmic reticulum. Replicative centres then merge into a single virus factory that contains, from the inside to the outside, zones that are involved in replication, membrane biogenesis, capsid assembly and DNA packaging, and fibre acquisition56,77. The virus internal layer seems to originate from multivesicular membrane structures that bud from the endoplasmic reticulum and become open membrane sheets; the major capsid protein is assembled around these sheets while acting as a scaffold78. Genome packaging occurs through a transient aperture that is distinct from the 'stargate' (Ref. 78). Finally, the layer of fibres is assembled. The involvement of the amoebal nucleus in the life cycle of APMV has been debated56,57,75. Indeed, the size of the amoebal nucleus decreases approximately twofold during APMV replication, even though this process occurs in a viral factory in the cytoplasm; amoebal nuclear factors may be involved.",

The cell nucleus undergoes transient morphological changes during early stages of the replication cycle, and marseillevirus viral factories tend to have a more extensive distribution in the cytoplasm than APMV viral factories. Marseilleviruses can form giant vesicles, comprised of dozens of virus particles, that are wrapped by membranes derived from the amoebal endoplasmic reticulum79. The viruses can be released outside of the amoeba within these giant vesicles; this may cause the amoeba to undergo phagocytosis through an acidification-independent process79. In addition, single marseillevirus particles may enter Acanthamoeba spp. through an endosome-stimulated pathway or may group together to trigger their own phagocytic uptake79.",

The wall and interior of these virus particles seem to assemble simultaneously. The replication of P. sibericum does not seem to affect the amoebal nucleus44. By contrast, infection by pandoraviruses and M. sibericum results in a disorganized amoebal nucleus that exhibits numerous membrane invaginations43,46. The pandoravirus factory seems to replace the cell nucleus, whereas the nucleus persists during infection with M. sibericum, with new virus particles emerging at its periphery. These observations are consistent with the fact that transcription-associated proteins are absent from pandoravirus and mollivirus particles, which suggests that they require the amoebal nucleus, but are present in pithovirus particles, which suggests that they can initiate transcription independently from the nucleus57.",

            "text": "Overall, giant viruses of amoebae enter cells through a phagocytic-like process and release hundreds of new virus particles through amoebal lysis; the exception is M. sibericum, for which the release of virus particles seems to occur through exocytosis without lysis46. Acanthamoeba spp. or V. vermiformis can protect giant viruses against physical and chemical threats, as they are highly stable organisms that can become encysted80. In addition, APMV particles were stable for 9 months in environmental freshwater, saline water and hospital ventilator devices81, and resisted antibiotics, 48 h of desiccation, and several chemical biocides, including alcohols82. Finally, the phagocytosis-like entry process of giant viruses contrasts with the need of specific interactions for other viruses to enter their host and could enable giant viruses to infect a broader range of hosts. Although amoebae are the primary hosts of giant viruses, mimiviruses and marseilleviruses have been detected in oysters, insects, monkeys, cattle and humans83,84,85. Moreover, APMV can enter various human myeloid cells and replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells76,86, and marseillevirus can cause a productive infection in human T lymphocyte cells87. In addition, the virus factories in which these giant viruses replicate were described for other viruses, including members of the proposed order Megavirales that are not discussed here, other DNA viruses (including herpesviruses) and some RNA viruses (such as flaviviruses or coronaviruses)88. These factories are replication organelles that recruit viral and cellular components for virus assembly and maturation. Viral factories were considered as the nuclei of 'virocells' (that is, cells infected by a virus, the aim of which is to produce virions), which would themselves correspond to the cellular forms of viruses when not strictly assimilated into a virus particle (or virion)26. In the case of APMV and other giant viruses of amoebae, if the virocell is the infected amoeba, the giant viral factory can be considered as its nucleus. This view is connected to two evolutionary scenarios: viral eukaryogenesis13, in which the eukaryotic nucleus originated from the viral factory of an ancient giant virus26, and nuclear viriogenesis, in which some giant viruses originated from the nucleus of ancient proto-eukaryotic cells89.",

They have small virus particles that are 35\u201374 nm in diameter and have an icosahedral capsid and a dsDNA genome of 17\u201329 kb. Their genomes are predicted to contain 16\u201334 genes, most of which are orphans or genes of unknown function, and six core genes90,91. Virophages cannot replicate alone in their amoebal host but, instead, replicate only in the presence of mimiviruses5. A co-culture procedure that uses a culturable helper virus was established to explore virophage diversity, and it enabled the isolation of new virophages and the analysis of their ability to infect mimivirus lineages92. The first virophage, named Sputnik, was isolated with mamavirus and was shown to impair its replication cycle and morphogenesis5. Specifically, the ability of mamavirus to lyse amoebae was decreased and mamavirus particles with abnormal morphologies were observed. So far, three Sputnik-like virophages, namely Sputnik2, Sputnik 3 and Rio Negro virophage, have been isolated, and they all infect lineage A, lineage B and lineage C of the Mimiviridae92,93,94. A divergent virophage that is associated with mimiviruses of Acanthamoeba spp., named Zamilon, was also isolated95. Another virophage, named Mavirus, depends on Cafeteria roenbergensis virus for its replication and was the second virophage to be discovered after Sputnik96. The study of virophage diversity is still in its infancy, and several studies suggest that virophages are common and especially abundant in the oceans. For example, virophages were identified in the genome of the marine alga Bigelowiella natans97, and virophage genomes were assembled from metagenomic datasets98. Virophages that infect mimiviruses have been recently classified in the family Lavidaviridae91. This classification highlights that, as suggested by their particle and genome size, virophages are similar in complexity to genuine dsDNA viruses, and they share a set of six core genes that strongly suggests their monophyletic origin. In addition, the promoter and transcription termination signals of mimivirus virophages are similar to those of mimiviruses, which suggests that these virophages rely on their associated giant virus for mRNA synthesis99.",

            "text": "Although practical for isolating new virophages, the use of a culture procedure that is based on A. polyphaga and mimiviruses as a reporter system92 was hindered by the unexpected discovery that mimiviruses of lineage A, but not of lineage B and lineage C, were resistant to the Zamilon virophage95. The search for a system that would explain this resistance was inspired by an analogy to the CRISPR\u2013Cas system, which is widely present in bacteria and archaea and relies on the integration of short DNA sequences from invaders7,100. The resistant lineage A isolates indeed have an insertion of four 15-nucleotide-long repeated Zamilon virophage sequences within an operon, named the MIMIVIRE, the resistance mechanism of which was suggested to rely on the sequence-specific recognition of a nucleic acid sequence7. The probability of finding such a sequence in this single mimivirus lineage by chance was very low (<1 \u00d7 10\u22129). MIMIVIRE-associated genes encode a helicase and nuclease that are involved in the degradation of foreign nucleic acids101 and the functions of which were experimentally validated7; MIMIVIRE also includes a gene that contains the repeated insert. Silencing each of these three genes by RNA interference restored the susceptibility of mimivirus to the Zamilon virophage. However, the exact molecular mechanism of MIMIVIRE is unclear. The MIMIVIRE system is thought to differ from CRISPR\u2013Cas systems owing to the absence of a Cas1 homologue, of protospacer-adjacent motifs and of a well-conserved organization that includes bona fide CRISPR-like repeats100,102. Furthermore, the helicase and nuclease that are described in this MIMIVIRE system are only distantly related to proteins that are classified in the same superfamilies as Cas3 and Cas4 proteins, and they do not seem to be related to them100. An alternative mechanism to explain the resistance of mimivirus to virophages is one that would rely on interactions between proteins, rather than on nucleic acid-based recognition, and would involve a restriction factor protein of the virophage replication machinery102.",

Thus, a substantial proportion of genes in the genomes of mimiviruses and other giant viruses are predicted to have been exchanged with bacteria, archaea, eukaryotes (including their amoebal hosts) and other viruses, although the direction of putative transfers is often unclear26,103. This high level of genome mosaicism might be related to the co-infection of amoebae by giant viruses and microorganisms, such as bacteria or fungi41,103. Indeed, giant viruses can multiply within amoebae that are infected with other microorganisms, which provides opportunities for horizontal gene transfer. Acanthamoeba spp. are well-known hosts for several bacteria and some fungi, in addition to viruses104. Acanthamoeba spp. that were isolated from a contact lens cleaning liquid were found to be co-infected with a mimivirus and two bacteria93, and Acanthamoeba spp. have been observed experimentally to be co-infected with marseillevirus and two bacteria41. In addition, the fact that, in their natural environment, giant viruses are sympatric with other microorganisms that infect Acanthamoeba helps to explain the large size of their genomes, which accumulate genes that increase their fitness against other microorganisms that replicate in amoebae103,105. Interestingly, a 16% decrease in genome size was observed by co-culturing APMV in amoebae in the absence of other microorganisms105; it was determined that the APMV genes that were inactivated were primarily those with the lowest expression, which suggests the loss of obsolete genes106. Moreover, these gene losses were associated with the loss of the external fibres that cover the APMV capsid and a decreased rate of replication105.",
