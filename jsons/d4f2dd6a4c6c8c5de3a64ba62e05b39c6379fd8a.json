Here we describe a proteome profiling technique designed to identify the source of blood meals of hematophagous arthropods. This method employs direct spectral matching and thus does not require a priori knowledge of any genetic or protein sequence information. Using this technology, we detect remnants of blood in blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) and correctly determine the vertebrate species from which the blood was derived even six months after the tick had fed. This biological fingerprinting methodology is sensitive, fast, cost-effective, and can potentially be adapted for other biological and medical applications when existing genome-based methods are impractical or ineffective. of the study and formulated the experimental and computational strategy. \u00d6. \u00d6. and B.K. performed all the experiments, including sample preparation and mass spectrometric analysis of vertebrate blood and I. scapularis samples.

Traditionally, labor intensive quantification of the parasite burden on all potential wildlife species was needed 19, 20 . These data are often heavily biased by the variation in trapping success among animal species 5, 16 . Analysis of the vertebrate blood remaining in hematophagous insects is an alternative and highly soughtafter method to determine the importance of each species to the parasite population [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Identification of the source of the blood found in vectors that are seeking a subsequent host is also considerably less labor intensive than observing vectors on live vertebrates. Moreover, collections of host-seeking vectors, as opposed to vectors collected from wildlife hosts, provide a random sample resulting in an unbiased quantification of the frequency in which each host species is parasitized.",

First, remnants of blood from previous hosts are often severely degraded when vectors begin seeking another host, drastically reducing the efficacy of most procedures 21, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Second, all methods to date select one or several target molecules a priori to distinguish among a set of a priori selected host species. Random degradation or digestion of the target molecules limits the success of these methodologies even though non-target molecules that can distinguish among host species may still be present 26, 32 . Further, target molecules may be identical among host species that are not included in a study thus reducing confidence in these procedures. Most importantly, suitable target molecules have not been characterized in the majority of wildlife species, thus limiting these methods to well characterized model organisms. In summary, a robust, universal method to analyze vector blood meals is needed to identify the impact of host species on the ecology and epidemiology of disease vectors.",

This methodology can be used to determine the ecological importance of each species in a vertebrate community to the maintenance of populations of hematophagous arthropods. We empirically validated this methodology by identifying the source of blood remnants in blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) that had fed on different vertebrate species.

The latter is possible for species with comprehensive and high-quality sequence databases such as M. musculus. We implemented this strategy on a larger dataset containing 40 runs of a SDS-PAGE fractionated protein digest sample of M. musculus blood. In this dataset, 20,156 of the 38,010 acquired tandem mass spectra survived the spectrum filter and were similarityclustered, as described above, into 3,584 clusters. At the same time, traditional sequence searching (Supplementary Methods) identified 10,324 spectra from the same dataset to a total of 1,566 distinct identifications (44% of 3,584). Therefore, less than half of all clusters were identified by sequence searching, likely due to incomplete search space (e.g. modifications not considered) and insufficient discriminating power of sequence searching. Of the clusters with at least one originating replicate identified, 1,492 entries (95%) are \"pure\" clusters that has only one sequence identification; 29 (2%) entries are \"mixed\" ones that have two or more different identifications; 35 (2%) entries are \"split\" clusters, for which the same identification was also found in another cluster; and 10 entries (1%) are both \"mixed\" and \"split\" (Fig. 4) . This result suggests that the clustering algorithm is largely capable of merging spectra that originate from the same peptide, but not those that originate from different peptides.",

The identification is made by finding the reference library with the highest similarity to the spectral dataset of the blood meal to be tested. A spectral dataset similarity score (SDSS) developed for this application provides a quantitative similarity measure between two spectral datasets, and hence the entire proteomes underlying the datasets. Using this algorithm, the blood in all five of the larval ticks that had fed to repletion on either of a two M. musculus mice was determined to be most similar to the M. musculus spectral reference library. These results had high bootstrap support (>99%), indicating that a large number and wide variety of spectra are available to correctly identify the blood in these ticks as M. musculus blood (Table 1 ). An example spectral dataset match is shown in Fig. 2 . These data also demonstrate that the presence of vector proteins in the sample do not detract from the ability of this methodology to identify the source of the blood meal. Correct identifications were also achieved for all larval ticks that had fed on any of four Peromyscus leucopus mice or any of three Tamias striatus chipmunks, all with high bootstrap support (>99%) ( Table 1) . Interestingly, the blood in the larval ticks that had fed on two of the three Sciurus carolinensis squirrels was not identified as squirrel blood, as there was no squirrel blood spectral reference library, but instead matched most closely with the chipmunk spectral reference library (Table 1) , the species that is evolutionarily most closely related to S. carolinensis among the reference libraries. Thus, this method can also identify an unknown sample to the closest-related species represented in the spectral libraries. This finding is corroborated by the evolutionary accuracy of the phylogenies built from the spectral reference libraries discussed below.",

The statistical confidence in M. musculus as the source of the previous bloodmeal was greater than 76% (bootstrap support) for each of the correctly classified nymphs. The two datasets that were not identified to the M. musculus were not misidentified to another organism; they simply had very low similarity scores with all spectral libraries, suggesting that little MS 2 data from the blood proteome was collected. More importantly, the spectral datasets from seven of eight nymphal ticks that had fed as larvae on natural reservoir hosts (P. leucopus (5/6) and T. striatus (2/2)) and subsequently held at 25\u00b0C for five months were successfully identified to the animal on which the ticks had previously fed, each with high bootstrap support ( Table 2) .

There were no instances in which the traditional sequence-based peptide identification methodology correctly identified the source of a blood meal that could not be identified using the spectral searching algorithm. Furthermore, the sequence-based method failed to identify the source of the blood meal for two ticks that fed on lab mouse, 4 out of 6 ticks that had fed on a white-footed mouse, and both ticks that had fed on a chipmunk. In these tick samples, no confident identification to any hemoglobin sequences were found. These results indicate that relying on a priori-selected target proteins (hemoglobin \u03b1 and \u03b2) for identification was more prone to failure than the spectral matching algorithm described when the blood meal has undergone digestion over time. This is likely because the target proteins may have been degraded, whereas our proteome profiling strategy is still able to identify the source of the blood meal source based on spectra from other, non-target, proteins. Although hemoglobin is the most abundant protein in vertebrate blood, only a small fraction of the matching spectra utilized by our method can be identified to hemoglobin sequences ( Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 ).",

The ability to correctly identify the source of blood from vectors that had fed multiple times using the spectral matching methodology presented here was determined by experimentally mixing whole blood from different species at specified ratios. Whole blood from an African Lion (Panthera leo) was mixed with blood from either an Amur Tiger (Panthera tigris), an American Alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) or a Red Kangaroo (Macropus rufus) at lion:other ratios of 1:1, 1:5, or 1:10. The choice of species was determined by the evolutionary relatedness ranging from very related to distantly related. Proteins from mixed blood samples were analyzed by LC-MS 2 and the SDSS algorithm as described above. The spectral matching methodology can successfully identify the one of the two true species in all cases (with high bootstrap support), even if blood from both species is roughly at equal concentrations (Fig. 5) . Additionally, when one source of blood is at much greater concentrations than the other (ratios of 1:5 and 1:10), the more concentrated source is identified as the top scoring hit in all cases, while the SDSS for the less abundant source varies. It is likely that blood derived from one of the multiple feedings will be predominant in a vector due to digestion between feedings or differences in the amount of blood acquired from each host. Under this scenario, this source of blood is likely to be identified by this method despite contamination with other blood sources. While the source of the blood making up the minor fraction can potentially be identified when it is at relatively high concentrations, a more sophisticated statistical method, as well as experimental samples that have fed on multiple host species, is needed to properly assess the validity of this method in identifying blood mixtures. Nevertheless, one of the true sources of the blood in a vector that has taken two blood meals in rapid succession can be identified with high confidence.",

This finding is practically useful as it indicates that the spectral reference libraries need not necessarily contain a complete set of potential host species to identify the evolutionary clade from which a blood meal was taken. For example, there is only one marsupial in Pennsylvania, the Virginia Opossum; blood meals acquired in Pennsylvania that match to the library of any marsupial can still be identified to the Virginia Opossum by inference. It is important to note that the species specificity of this methodology -the level of biological organization (order, genus, species, population) to which one can confidently identify the source of a blood meal -is dependent on the species richness of the library. Thus, adding more species to the database should permit the determination of the vertebrate source of a blood meal to a finer evolutionary resolution. We expect that our method, like any method that depends on the evolutionary changes in protein sequences, will eventually reach a limit in resolution.

The efficacy of this method may be further improved by better proteome coverage, which can be readily obtained using state-ofthe-art mass spectrometers. In this study, each spectral reference library was built with two replicate LC-MS 2 runs of unfractionated blood using a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer, leaving considerable room to improve proteome coverage. One should also note that digestion of the blood meal is likely much faster in these experimental ticks than in natural conditions as nymphs are inactive at the very low winter temperatures after their larval blood meal. As environmental conditions affect digestion in ectothermic animals 46,47 , the detection limit of the blood proteome from the nymphal vector may be extended further under natural field conditions. Future applications of this work to field-collected ticks with a broader range of potential host species will help to further evaluate the efficacy of this methodology under natural environmental conditions. This spectral library-based approach has several distinct theoretical advantages over traditional genome-obligated proteomic data analysis methods. On the one hand, genome sequence data is not available from the vast majority of animals that are potential sources of blood meals for hematophagous parasites, which limits the potential animal species that can be included in any study using traditional methods. On the other hand, a spectral library is essentially a record of the MS-detectable proteome, including all post-translational modifications, information that is not readily deducible from the genome sequences. Experimentally observed spectra also contain information on the true intensity of fragment ions, presence of neutral-loss fragments, and other unexpected but reproducible minor ions, none of which can be predicted from sequences, leading to more accurate spectral matching. In fact, the spectral matching methodology is shown to perform better than a recently proposed sequence-based methodology that utilizes sequences of dominant blood proteins (hemoglobin subunits \u03b1 and \u03b2), especially in identification of the source of blood from molted nymphal ticks (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2 ). This is likely because the spectral matching methodology performs an unbiased profiling that accounts for any molecules that can be ionized and fragmented in the mass spectrometer, as opposed to restricting detection to an a priori selected set of target peptides. Proteomic profiling methodologies should also have more discriminating power and better resolution among species, as closely related species may not be distinguishable based on the sequences of a few peptides. Moreover, experimental extraction and de novo sequencing of specific proteins is also a painstaking and error-prone process.",

Third, it is not necessary to remove tick protein contaminants during sample preparation, as this method is robust against impurities. This is because the spectral dataset similarity score as defined is unaffected by unmatched spectra.

Six engorged larvae from three different P. leucopus mice and two engorged larvae from two different T. straitus chipmunks were allowed to molt and held at 25\u00b0C for five months post-molt before being frozen for processing and blood meal analysis.",

Each bootstrapped sample was searched against each reference library and the most similar reference library (greatest SDSS score) was recorded. The confidence in the species identified as the source of the previous blood meal is the fraction of bootstrapped samples for which the most similar reference library is derived from the correct species.

Example of spectral dataset matches for (b) one larva engorged with M. musculus (MM2.l1), or (c) one molted nymph held at 25 \u00b0C for 6 months after feeding on M. musculus (MM1.n4). The majority of spectral matches for the tick datasets are to library spectra from the correct (M. musculus) species, or to spectra from multiple species including M. musculus. The matched spectra are subjected to sequence searching against hemoglobin sequences. While some spectral matches are due to hemoglobin (red), many other matches cannot be identified by sequence searching (green). Bayesian phylogenies constructed in MrBayes using the presence or absence of each spectrum in each reference library in the variable evolutionary model designed for restriction digest data resulted in a phylogeny that recapitulates the established relationships among these species.
