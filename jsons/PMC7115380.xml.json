As a starting point, inactivated SARS-CoV has been considered as one of the major vaccine candidates [12]. Several inactivated SARS vaccines prepared by conventional protocols, e.g. beta-propiolactone, formaldehyde or UV light, have been tested in preclinical studies [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. These killed whole virus vaccines are effective in terms of their capacity to induce neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity in several animal models. However, the antigenic and immunogenic properties of inactivated SARS-CoV remain to be characterized. Specially, identifying and characterizing the antigenic epitopes that induce protective immunity is a priority for developing a safe and effective SARS vaccine.",

A 193-amino acid discrete fragment (residues 318\u2013510) within the putative S1 subunit of the S protein has been characterized as the minimal receptor-binding domain (RBD) [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. Coincidently, the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein is also a major target of neutralizing antibodies [23], [31], [32], [33]. Several conformation-dependent epitopes capable of inducing highly potent neutralizing antibodies have been characterized in the RBD [34]. We previously showed that an inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine could induce high titers of antibodies against the S protein in immunized animals, and that, importantly, the RBD-specific antibodies contributed a majority of sera-mediated neutralizing activity [32], [35]. In this study, we isolated a panel of 12 RBD-specific mAbs from the inactivated vaccine-immunized mice to determine the responsible epitopes for the neutralizing antibodies. Our results provide important information for designing SARS vaccines.",

All anti-RBD mAbs reacted with not only the RBD-Fc, but also the S1-Fc, EC-S, and FL-S (Table 1), suggesting that they may target the epitopes presented on the native S protein. Some mAbs bound to RBD, EC-S and FL-S effectively, but not S1-Fc. The reduced binding could be due to alteration of the epitope conformation resulted from lack of trimetic association in the S protein. It was of interest to note that two mAbs (S29 and S33) had relatively weaker reactivity with S1-Fc and EC-S, implying that their epitopes may not be well exposed on these two proteins.",

We previously showed that Conf III to VI mAbs could efficiently or partially block the receptor-binding but Conf I to II not [34]. To determine whether the newly isolated anti-RBD mAbs had inhibitory activity on the receptor binding, a similar flow cytometry-based assay was used to measure the binding of RBD-Fc to human ACE2 expressed on 293T cells (293T/ACE2) in the presence of the anti-RBD mAbs. As shown in Fig. 5\n, RBD-Fc was able to bind to ACE2-expressed 293T cells, but the binding could be efficiently or partially blocked by representative anti-RBD mAbs. Group B (S20, S38, and S53) and Group C (S44) mAb had higher potency compared with the corresponding Conf III (11E12 and 18D9) and VI (13B6 and 19B2) control mAbs, respectively (Fig. 6\n). Unexpectedly, most of Group A mAbs (4 out of 5) was also able to partially inhibit the receptor-binding, except that S40, which had highest capacity to compete with Conf I mAb, had no significant inhibitory activity, similar to the Conf I mAbs (10E7 and 12B11). These results imply that Group A\u2013C epitopes may not be identical with those of the previously characterized, rather than may their epitopes be overlapped in terms of their competitive binding. Therefore, the mAbs of the Groups A, B, C were also named as Conf I, III, VI-like mAbs, respectively (Table 3). Similar to the Group A mAbs, the Group D mAb (S25) also weakly inhibited the binding of RBD-Fc and ACE2 (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). In contrast, none of two linear epitope-dependant mAbs (S29 and S33) blocked the association between RBD-Fc and ACE2. These data suggest that inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine can induce RBD-specific antibodies that primarily target the receptor-binding motif (RBM).",

The Conf III to VI epitopes may overlap the receptor-binding motif (RBM) as the corresponding mAbs can efficiently or partially block the receptor binding. With similar binding competition assays, the conformation-specific anti-RBD mAbs isolated from the mice immunized with the inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine have been mapped to four distinct epitopes (Groups A to D), further demonstrating that the RBD contains multiple conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes. Half of the conformation-specific mAbs (5 out of 10) recognized Group A epitope, which may overlap with the previously characterized Conf I epitope, a major neutralizing epitope presented by independently folded-RBD. This suggests that the epitopes for Group A and Conf I mAbs have better immunogenicity than other epitopes in both whole inactivated viruses and independently folded RBD immonogens. However, Group A epitope and Conf I epitpe might not be identical even they could compete with each other because they had different competition efficiency with the biotinylated mAb (Table 3) and different capacity to block the receptor binding (Fig. 6). Group B and C mAbs recognize the epitopes that may overlap with the previously characterized Conf III and VI epitopes, respectively, but they had higher potency to inhibit the association between RBD and ACE2. According to the unique binding competition pattern, the Group D mAb, S25, recognized a novel conformational neutralizing epitope in RBD. These data suggested that the RBD in the inactivated virus and the recombinant S protein might display different immunogenicity, and thus allowed the isolation of neutralizing mAbs that recognize different conformation-dependent epitopes. However, none of the mAbs targeting the Conf II, IV, and V epitopes were isolated from the inactivated SARS-CoV-immunized mice, suggesting that these epitopes might not be immunodominant or even not be functional in the inactivated vaccine. Conf IV and V epitopes may overlap the receptor-binding motif in RBD and induce most potent neutralizing antibodies [34]. Their functional presentation on the immunogens is critical for SARS vaccines. It is possible that viral inactivation procedures may affect the antigenic structures of the neutralizing epitopes in the S protein of SARS-CoV, thus limiting their ability to induce neutralizing antibodies. Consistent with our previous finding [34], the mAbs targeting the linear epitopes in the RBD had no neutralizing activity. The RBD of SARS-CoV S protein is well exposed on the surface of virion and is responsible for attachment and binding with receptor ACE2. However, we recently found that the linear epitopes in the RBD, unlike the conformational epitopes, were not well exposed on the S protein expressed on the transfected-cells as shown by flow cytometry assays (data not shown), providing evidence to explain why the linear epitope-specific mAbs can not neutralize SARS-CoV.",

It contains seven cysteines and five of them are essential for receptor ACE2 binding [29]. Several critical residues in the RBD have been characterized to be determinants for SARS-CoV receptor adaptation from palm civets to humans [39], [40]. Crystal structure of the RBD bound with the human ACE2 reveals that several disulfide bonds connect cysteines 323 to 348, 366 to 419, and 467 to 474 to form the loops [38], and the residues 424 to 494 constitute the receptor-binding motif (RBM) [38]. The conformation-dependent epitopes in RBD may be determined by its complex structures. Recently, it was reported that the ability of the full-length S protein to induce neutralizing antibodies could be abolished by single-point mutations of the conserved amino acid residues in the RBD (e.g. R441A) [41], indicating that the immunogenicity of S protein is highly determined by the RBD configuration. To further map the critical residues for the RBD-based neutralizing epitopes, we generated a panel of RBD mutants with substitutions or deletions of conserved amino acid residues. It was surprising to find that Group A to C conformational epitopes, similar to the Conf I to IV and VI epitopes, could be disrupted by single amino acid substitutions (e.g. D429A, R441A or D454A) or by deletions of several amino acids at the N- or C-terminal regions of the RBD. However, the Group D epitope, like the Conf V epitope, is not sensitive to the deletions and mutations. It was of interest to note that K390A substitution could not did not impact any of the antigenic epitopes significantly even though it abolishes the functionality of ACE2 binding [42]. These results suggest that some particularly conserved RBD residues are essential to maintain the antigenic integrity of RBD, and that the S25 epitope within RBD is unique. Although Group D and Conf V mAbs have a similar pattern in the reactions with the mutants, they are apparently directed against different epitopes. First, they do not compete with each other in binding; Second, Conf V mAbs can completely block the receptor-binding but S25 only has marginal inhibitory activity. Further localization and characterization of both Group D and Conf V epitopes will provide important information for rationally designing SARS vaccines.",

Our results here indicate that although the major neutralizing domain of SARS-CoV is functional in the inactivated vaccine preparation, some important neutralizing epitopes (e.g. Conf IV and V) may not be properly presented compared with those presented on the recombinant RBD molecules. Vigilance should be taken for application of the inactivated vaccines in humans since viral particle contains a number of components that may induce harmful immune and/or inflammatory responses. We believe that the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein may serve as a better candidate for developing safe and effective vaccines since it is a functional region that mediates the receptor-binding and virus entry, and contains multiple epitopes that induce highly potent neutralizing antibodies [10], [11]. In addition, RBD-based vaccine can be safely manufactured comparing with the inactivated SARS-CoV.",
