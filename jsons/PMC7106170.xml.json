Due to special characteristics, Pteropus bats are the perfect reservoir for most of the recently emerging zoonotic pathogens. They often live in large colonies or roosts and travel long distances; thus they are very effective in transmitting viruses among colony members and disseminating them over a considerable distance. Interactions among bats, humans and livestock are constantly increasing due to anthropogenic activities, thereby increasing the potential for transmission of viruses. Deforestation in tropical areas destroyed the natural habitats of these fruit bat species thus forcing them to live in the vicinity of human settlements. The resulting close contact is responsible for the emergence of highly pathogenic paramyxoviruses, like Hendra and Nipah virus (NiV) in human populations in Southeast Asia and Australia (Mackenzie et al., 2003).",

Blood, organs (kidney, liver, and spleen), throat swabs, rectal swabs and urine samples were collected from bats. Waste disposal was done following guidelines and proper precautionary measures. Organ specimens were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after necropsy, while blood samples were kept at room temperature for 30 min and Centrifuged for 10 min at approximately 1000 g.

The 70\u201380% confluent monolayer of the cells was infected with 10 multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) virus and observed for seven post-infection days. The methodology of cell infection by the virus was similar as mentioned above in Section 2.4.

            "text": "There is scanty information available regarding the hosts, reservoirs and transmission of TioV, though direct transmission via ingestion of fruit by humans has been suggested (Lehle et al., 2007). However, bat-to-human transmission of TioV has not yet been reported. Neutralizing antibodies against TioV have been detected in human serum samples from Tioman Island in Malaysia, from where the virus was first isolated (Yaiw et al., 2007). TioV's estimated prevalence of 1.8% is suggestive of its potential to cause subclinical infection in humans. Experimental studies have shown that TioV is capable of infecting and replicating in pigs and its main cellular targets are lymphocytes, thymic epithelioreticular cells and the tonsillar epithelium in these animals (Yaiw et al., 2008). Hence, pigs could act as an intermediate or amplifying host for human transmission, as has happened during Menangle Virus and NiV outbreaks (Parashar et al., 2000). During NiV outbreaks in Malaysia, pigs played a critical role in transmitting the disease to pig handlers by direct contact. Pig farms are a source of daily livelihood for a large number of populations in Assam and other states like Nagaland. The Nagaland pig production and marketing project is funded by the National Agricultural Innovation Project with a contribution from the International Fund for Agricultural Development and aims to develop sustainable solutions to livelihood improvement in one of the poorest districts in India. Pig farming was rampant during the year 2008 and being a good reservoir of many diseases in recent past the number of Japanese encephalitis cases and outbreaks were increased in these areas. Undetected mild TioV infection could occur in naturally infected pigs and this could facilitate viral transmission to humans via contact with oral secretions; this transmission could cause serious illness by crossing the species barrier. Therefore, the role of bats and pigs in transmitting viruses to humans in Asia needs to be determined. Although no evidence of TioV illness in humans or animals exists, TioV's close relationship to other disease-causing bat paramyxoviruses, including NiV, suggests the possibility that it too may cross the species barrier (Bowden and Boyle, 2005).",
