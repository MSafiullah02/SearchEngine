This required the focus of laboratories to shift to providing better, faster diagnosis, which has driven the development of new approaches to monitor viral infections and to support antiviral treatment through: quantitative viral loads, antiviral susceptibility testing, viral genotyping and, point-of-care testing. Despite the massive impact that molecular diagnostics has had on viral diagnosis, significant strides have been made in antigen detection and serological tests, in development of \"rapid tests\", for the direct detection of viral antigen in clinical specimens and detection of antibodies in convalescent or chronic infections.

Figure 6 .1 depicts the typical period that acute viruses can be detected in blood and the time before IgM becomes visible and later IgG [4, 6] . For many acute viruses the viremia varies but may be relatively short and virus can only be detected in the first 10 days from the time that clinical symptoms became apparent, either in the blood or urine if it causes a systemic infection, such as arboviruses or measles; in the stool for enteric viruses such as rotavirus or poliovirus; in the site of infection such as the respiratory tract for respiratory viruses; or central nervous system for neuroinvasive infections. During this time virus specific tests such as virus isolation, antigen tests or molecular tests such as reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are appropriate. For viruses that are less common in the environment such as the arboviruses and childhood diseases prior to vaccination, IgM antibody tests can be requested after 7-10 days, but may not be detected in early specimens and are not appropriate for common viruses such as the respiratory viruses that may cause frequent reinfections. IgG antibody would only be used to diagnose acute infections if a paired serum is available 10-14 days apart and is not used for common viruses that may cause frequent reinfections. IgG testing may also be used to determine immune status following vaccines. Maternal antibody will interfere with IgG testing the first 4-6 months of life and therefore, for chronic diseases such as HIV transmission in children from HIV-infected mothers, DNA PCR testing is more suitable [4, 7, 8] .

Negative staining of the clinical sample is a relatively straightforward; inexpensive technique that would represent a \"catch all\" method of viral identification. EM could be particularly useful in identifying fastidious [87] or non-cultivable [88] [89] [90] virus in specimens, providing they have a high virus concentration with a sensitivity limit of approximately 10 6 viral particles per milliliter of specimen, making a negative result difficult to interpret [2] . While the sensitivity could be increased by ultracentrifugation or antibody-induced clumping, a further limitation is the lack of specificity, as EM can only identify up to the family level whereafter, other methods would have to be applied for a specific diagnosis [3] .

However, in the last 10 years molecular techniques have become routine. Virus isolation needs to remain an important part of viral diagnostics in order to maintain a source for analyzing, not only genotypic changes, but also phenotypic changes in virus populations for vaccine relevance and epidemiology. This allows identification of changes in antigenicity, pathogenicity and viral characteristics to update vaccines, such as the influenza vaccine, to match circulating strains [92] . Quality of the specimen, the time that it takes to reach the laboratory and transport under cold chain will determine the success of virus isolation. Detection of viruses in cell culture requires a considerable expertise and is performed by microscope examination, looking for degenerative morphological changes in the cell monolayer. This is called the cytopathic effect (CPE). Not all viruses grow in all cell types or produce CPE and further antigen or nucleic detection methods are required to correctly identify the specific virus involved. Clinical specimens are usually inoculated onto several cell lines to provide an optimum environment for a range of viruses (Table 6. 2) [93] . An adaption of traditional viral culture formats has been developed, which allows for more rapid detection of viruses, especially for viruses which are known to grow slowly in conventional cell culture. This is achieved by inoculating the specimen onto a microscope slide and centrifugation of the culture to enhance the infection rate (Shell vial assays). The enhanced detection rate may result from better contact between cells in the specimen and the cell culture, thus allowing for earlier and more extensive infection of the cell lines, as well as through the use of fluorescent-labeled (e.g. FITC) monoclonal antibodies directed to the viral antigen [93] .

These assays have application in diagnosis of single cases or as part of epidemiological studies to describe the etiologies of specific syndromes.

While virus specific antigen may only be detected in the first 10 days of acute infections, IgM antibody is detected within 7-14 days following infection and may remain for a month or more in the patient's blood after the infection was cleared. Therefore, IgM can be used to detect a recent infection. IgG antibody is detected after 10-14 days of infection and can be present for life. Sero-conversion to IgG is measured with paired sera taken during the acute and the convalescent phase, 10-14 days apart. A significant rise in antibody of fourfold increase is seen as a positive reaction and new infection, while a single IgG positive test may reflect infection any time in the past. In pediatric infections, maternal immunity needs to be taken into consideration in the first 6 months of life and may only be cleared by 18 months, and may therefore, interfere with serological diagnosis in infants. Assays for detection of IgM or IgG are usually qualitative, since the presence or absence of antibody is enough to make a diagnosis. However, when a rise in antibody has to be detected, the test needs to be quantitative in order to detect an increase in antibody from the first to the second specimen.
