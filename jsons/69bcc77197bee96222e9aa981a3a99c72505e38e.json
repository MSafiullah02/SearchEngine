Contemplating such tragic choices naturally conjures thoughts that we might have avoided these dilemmas by rapidly manufacturing new beds and ventilators at the first sign of a looming pandemic, or by rapidly converting existing beds and machines such that they could be used to expand the supply of critical care resources. These ideas stem from the natural human heuristic and conventional clinical ethos to mount unstinting effort toward saving the lives of those who fall ill. These views are also psychologically reinforced by the instinct to deploy aggressive medical technology to win the \"war\" against the pandemic.",

No one would condone a response to the COVID-19 pandemic that did not include using the nation's full supply of critical care resources. However, the drive to build even more beds and ventilators will do more to assuage public anxiety and outrage than to reduce overall mortality, owing to both the poor outcomes among patients with COVID-19 receiving mechanical ventilation and the diversion of clinical workforces.",

As psychologically disruptive as it may be to consider not expanding the critical care supply, such expansions would magnify the already considerable skew of U.S. health care toward intensive care. We further argue that even modest improvements in public health measures, such as physical distancing (which might be promoted by infomercials featuring sports or movie stars) and training more health care workers to become expert in serious illness communication, would be more effective than investments in critical care for improving short-term population health.",
