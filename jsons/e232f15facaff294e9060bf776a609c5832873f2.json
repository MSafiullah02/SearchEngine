Several surgical procedures have recently been performed and proposed for both diagnosed and asymptomatic or undiagnosed infected patients. Regional anesthesia (RA) is recommended as the first choice modality in order to avoid the aerosol-forming interventions during the anesthetic management of the patients with COVID-19 infection (1, 2) . On the other hand, COVID-19 infection has been reported to be associated with thrombocytopenia (3, 4) . In addition, it has also been reported that significant intraoperative hypotension (systolic BP <80% of the baseline) is witnessed in 86% of parturients undergoing continuous epidural anesthesia (EA) due to COVID-19 infection (1) . For this reason, caution should be exercised while performing the central neuraxial anesthesia. Here, we would like to share our experience in the case suspected for COVID-19 infection, where we carried out peripheral nerve blocks (PNB).",

The ultrasonography (USG) device, also including the probes and cables, was kept with transparent plastic covers to prevent contamination. The procedure was decided to be performed by the most experienced anesthesiologist. To protect the staff, an appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as FFP3 masks, goggles, full-face shield, apron and double gloves were used before the procedure. Since the operator anesthesiologist declared the visual quality to be impared due to the evaporation during the preparation phase, the blocks were performed after applying goggles with anti-fog agent and removing face shield.",

Also, the experienced practitoners may decrease the nerve damage using the combination of USG, nerve stimulation and injection pressure monitoring. In conclusion, we consider that PNB is the first anesthetic choice to perform appropriate surgeries in those with COVID-19 infection.",
