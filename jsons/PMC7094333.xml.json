Airborne transmission of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) go unchecked from the shameful fraction of cases that are passively detected. Yet, we forget or ignore that acquired drug resistance can be prevented if those with latent TB infection (LTBI) never get the disease.",

Additionally, for more than a decade, more accurate Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved blood tests have been available.

Unlike the skin test, IGRAs are not impacted by prior Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) vaccination or most non-tuberculous mycobacterial bacilli, and they require only one patient visit instead of two to get a result.6 In large prospective LTBI prevalence trials in China and Vietnam comparing an IGRA to tuberculin skin tests (TST) head to head, a profound reduction in LTBI rates and a statistically significant higher progression rate were found with the IGRA.7, 8, 9\n",

Drug resistant strains and incurable drug resistance continue to grow and spread, becoming part of the seedbed of tomorrow's disease. Yet, most Indian providers wait for TB to come.

It is also misunderstood that treatment of LTBI could cause drug resistance. India's annual infection rate is estimated at 1.5%, hardly a high chance for general reinfection, and the bacilli burden in LTBI is much too small to harbor wild drug resistant mutants required for drug resistance to emerge. A WHO systematic review showed no evidence of acquired resistance from LTBI treatment.2 Finally, there is a perception that LTBI treatment toxicity is similar to active TB treatment which is utterly false.",

According to a WHO modeling study, the critical mass for accelerating the decline to end TB by 2050 is effectively treating 14% of those with LTBI along with effectively treating all TB cases.1 This amounts to approximately 73 million persons of the estimated 40 percent of the Indian population with LTBI.

Our obstacles to a true call to action mimic the stealth slow nature of the TB pathogen itself. Its timescale from infection to disease is variable, unpredictable and long. It could be decades before disease emerges. Instead of thinking of it as a time bomb or land mine, we behave on a slow time scale by acting incrementally, repeating studies and collecting evidence as if time itself will solve the problem. Our obsession on the affordability and cost-effectiveness of interventions make us forget the unrelenting toll and cost caused by TB's kill rate, pervasiveness, individual financial impact, lifelong morbidity and acquired drug resistance. How can we not afford to prevent TB? We must accept the fact that if we truly want to achieve the goal of eliminating TB it will be expensive.
