            "text": "Solid organ transplantation is an ever evolving field, with significant advances in the management of recipients of solid organ transplantation, including enhanced immune suppression and antimicrobial prophylaxis for at-risk patients [1, 2]. In order to increase the number of available organs, and, in turn, save more lives of those on the transplant wait list, the donor pool must continue to expand [3]. Donors reflect the diverse US population; there are an increasing number of donors born in, who have resided in, or who have traveled to underdeveloped areas of the world or areas with geographically restricted infections [4]. As such, these donors are exposed to pathogens that can potentially be transmitted to recipients of the donor\u2019s organs. Additionally, there are newer techniques to identify many pathogens that may be transmitted from the donor to the transplant recipients [5, 6]. Finally, high-profile reports of several donor-derived infections have heightened awareness of donor-derived infections and have likely contributed to increased recognition [7\u201319]. In this chapter, the incidence, methods of identification and prevention, and management of unexpected donor-derived infections will be reviewed. Often, donors are expected to transmit infection (i.e., CMV donor seropositive, recipient seronegative) because of information known by the transplant team posttransplant. In most cases, such information will lead to interventions to reduce the incidence and severity of transmitted disease and is reviewed elsewhere in this text.",

The Council of Europe has also developed a similar guidance document that is updated regularly to provide similar guidance on donor screening and risk mitigation (https://www.edqm.eu/en/organ-transplantation-mission-67.html). Likewise, the European Union and national governments have established laws and directives that regulate these same functions outside the United States.\n",

While the risk of transmission varies (i.e., low risk with appropriately treated documented bacterial meningitis or Naegleria encephalitis, high risk with active HIV infection), the fact that there is a risk of disease transmission requires several key steps:The organ procurement organization must inform the recipient center of the potentially transmissible infection.The recipient center must assess if the benefit of transplantation outweighs the risk of disease transmission.The recipient center must obtain special informed consent to use the organ from the donor with recognized risk of disease transmission.The recipient center must develop a plan to treat the recipient, if appropriate, to prevent disease transmission and monitor the recipient for evidence of transmitted infection.Specific details of these key steps will be discussed in greater detail later in the chapter.",

            "text": "Some donors do not have documented infection but instead have engaged in behaviors or have other characteristics that place the donor at increased risk of infection with pathogens, such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, that can, in turn, be transmitted to the recipient. These donors have been defined by the OPTN and US Public Health Services (PHS) as donors at increased risk of disease transmission, termed increased risk donors. The PHS updated their guidance related to increased risk donors in 2013, and this guidance has been adopted as the standard for most transplant systems globally [20]. This updated guideline refined prior guidance taking into account current knowledge of the epidemiology of HIV, HBV, and HCV in the community and the limitations of our contemporary screening practices (Table 8-2). The guideline focuses on three key core recommendations:\nScreening:There is no single standardized and validated tool for collecting the donor\u2019s medical and social history, although many US OPOs are utilizing the Uniform Donor Risk Assessment Interview Tool (http://www.aatb.org/DRAI-Documents). Although living and deceased donors are considered to be equal risk in the guidelines, living donors are able to provide their own history, while histories from deceased donors are obtained from friends and relatives. These individuals may not know the fine details of the donor\u2019s social situation (e.g., the mother of a college student who does not live at home). As such, the guideline recognizes these limitations and places donors with incomplete donor histories in the increased risk category as risks may be present but unrecognized.The 2013 guidelines newly recommend that all donors be screened with serology and nucleic acid testing (NAT) for hepatitis C, regardless of risk factors, and that all increased risk donors be screened with HIV NAT in addition to routine serology. At the present time, only serology is mandated for hepatitis B screening, although this serologic assessment includes hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) which allows for direct detection of the virus. The addition of NAT screening to serology will allow increased detection of acute infections as NAT decreases the length of time between initial infection and the ability of the test to detect the infection, referred to as the window period (Figure 8-1).\nThe guideline also recognizes that living donors may continue to engage in behaviors that place them at increased risk of disease transmission between screening and donation. As such, the guidelines recommend that living donors are screened as close to the donation procedure as possible, not to exceed 28 days. The feasibility of this recommendation has been demonstrated clinically [21].\nConsenting: Any patient who is to receive an organ from a patient with risk factors should understand the risk and agree to receive the organ based on that risk assessment. A specialized informed consent for increased risk donor organ use is mandated by policy.Follow-up testing: Perhaps one of the most important recommendations of the PHS guidelines is the need to do posttransplant testing of recipients that received increased risk donor organs to ensure that a disease transmission has not occurred. Early testing may affect outcomes if a transmission is identified, as available effective therapy can be introduced sooner after transmission. Recommendations include HIV NAT (or combined antibody\u2013antigen assay), HCV NAT, HBV NAT, and HBsAg at 1\u20133 months posttransplant and HBV serology at 12 months posttransplant (including hepatitis B surface antibody, hepatitis B core antibody, and either HBV NAT or HBsAg) [20]. However, data as of 2011 show that posttransplant testing is not reliably performed [22]. Using assays that directly detect the virus in the posttransplant period is critical, and serology may not be reliable because recipients frequently fail to seroconvert due to transmitted infections. In all cases of HCV transmission identified in the United States, for example, all recipients have been seronegative but NAT positive even when tested nearly 1 year posttransplant [23, 24].\n",

Review of existing data clearly demonstrates that the risk of HIV and HCV infection varies significantly by risk behavior (Table 8-3). Given the enhanced risk, it is important to realize that patients may acquire infection in the NAT window, the period of time between infection and when NAT can detect infection (see below). As such, while NAT decreases the risk of disease transmission, residual risk remains and has clearly been demonstrated by three recent transmissions of HCV from donors engaged in nonmedical drug use prior to death with negative donor NAT testing [23].\n",

Underreporting to DTAC was common initially, but recent data show a substantial increase in the numbers of reports (Table 8-4 and Figure 8-2) [24, 25]. In the era of current screening, the following unexpected transmissions have been reported: numerous bacterial species (including gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods), Ehrlichia chaffeensis, legionella, syphilis, M. tuberculosis, Candida spp., histoplasmosis, zygomycosis, Aspergillus spp., scedosporiosis, coccidioidomycosis, cytomegalovirus, HIV, HBV, HCV, adenovirus, coxsackievirus, human T-lymphotropic virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and a related arenavirus, West Nile virus (WNV), rabies, schistosomiasis, strongyloides, Trypanosoma cruzi, microsporidiosis, and Balamuthia spp. [7\u20139, 11\u201313, 15\u201319, 23\u201338].

While confirmed bacterial transmissions are not the most commonly reported transmission, they likely represent the most common form of disease transmission. Most of the confirmed cases of bacteria transmissions involve highly resistant gram-positive and gram-negative infections. From a series of historical studies, 5\u20139% of abdominal organs and up to 63% of thoracic organs appear to be contaminated with bacterial pathogens at the time of procurement [25, 39\u201342]. Use of perioperative antibiotics reduces the risk of disease transmission, although under-recognition and underreporting of bacterial transmissions are likely. Given the high rate of contamination and the increasing prevalence of highly resistant bacteria in hospitals globally, bacterial transmissions will increase over time [25, 39\u201342]. As such, diligence is important among transplant teams.",

It is critical, and required by current UNOS Policy, that everyone caring for transplant recipients considers the potential of donor origin in all infections, particularly early posttransplant, and has a plan in place to report this concern to the local OPO and to UNOS [43]. Organ vigilance systems, similar to the OPTN/UNOS Patient Safety System, contribute to more rapid communication. Efficient and timely communication is associated with a lower rate of recipient adverse events, including death [44].

In the indirect ELISA (http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_topics&view=article&id=10&Itemid=40743), a known antigen is fixed to the bottom of a plastic surface, usually a multi-well plate. Serum is then added and if antibodies that react to the antigen are present, they bind to the antigen. The plates are then washed and a detection antibody (usually an anti-IgG or anti-IgM antibody) that is conjugated to a substrate-specific enzyme is applied to each well. After washing, a substrate is then applied and is converted by the enzyme conjugated to the detector antibody, typically resulting in a colorimetric change. The intensity of this change provides a semiquantitative measurement of the presence of the antigen-specific antibody. To detect an antigen, a sandwich ELISA is used in which a capture antibody (one which is specific for the antigen of interest) is bound to the plates. The patient\u2019s serum is applied and if antigen is present, it is bound by the capture assay. The plates are then washed and antigen-specific antibodies are applied\u2014creating an antibody\u2013antigen\u2013antibody sandwich. Detection antibodies and substrate are added as above and the resultant colorimetric change is read. Both of these methods have relatively rapid turnaround times, are not subject to a significant risk of contamination, and can usually be done by either an automatic machine or with minimal technical skills.",

            "text": "As discussed below, there are clear challenges to these serological assays. To detect infection earlier, before antibodies have been created, NAT is used for screening of certain infections. NAT refers to a wide range of polymerase change reaction (PCR), transcription amplification testing (TMA), and branched DNA tests. PCR is the most widely used test in which primers that code for complimentary regions of a pathogen-specific gene of interest are selected. For RNA viruses, the RNA is first reverse transcribed to create a complementary DNA (cDNA) based on the RNA template. At this point, PCR for both RNA and DNA viruses are the same. The source nucleic acids are then mixed with the selected primers, DNA polymerase, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and buffer materials. An initialization step activates the polymerase, and then a denaturation step melts the DNA into two single strands so that the primers may anneal. Extension or elongation then occurs and repeated cycles proceed to amplify the presence of the gene of interest. The presence of DNA can be detected in one of several ways. In real-time PCR, fluorescent dyes are used to intercalate into the double-stranded DNA to quantitatively detect the target DNA. NAT is challenged by longer turnaround time than serologic tests, greater technical expertise to perform the test, and risk of contamination that may result in false-positive test results, especially in low-volume laboratories.",

Once viremia is present, the immune system can recognize the virus and produce neutralizing antibodies to components of the virus [58]. The period between initial infection and the first detection of these antibodies is referred to as the window period [59]. Transmission of both HIV and HCV from donor to recipient has been reported to UNOS during both the eclipse and serologic window periods [17, 23, 24].

There are a number of ways in which hemodilution can be assessed, and no one method is currently considered the gold standard; a simple guideline is that testing may be less reliable if the donor has received greater than 2 L of blood or crystalloid within 48 h of blood sampling or greater than 1 L of crystalloid within 1 h of sampling in adults; recommendations are more strict for pediatric donors [62, 63]. Second, some donors may lose their serologic responseto certain infections over time, particularly if they are immunosuppressed. Thirdly, in infant donors, serologic testing may detect the presence of maternal antibodies without active infection of the child [64].",

The major differences between these donor types are the potential quality of the donor history and the time frame during which donor screening may take place. In the case of living donation, the actual donor is interviewed, which may allow for collection of a more accurate medical and behavioral history. The quality of the medical and behavioral history is more challenging in deceased donation in which the histories are obtained from friends and family members who may not know all of the medical or behavioral details\u2014especially if there was limited contact between the donor and the historian. Often, the clinical circumstances leading to the death of the deceased donor may contribute to this limitation\u2014often donors are found down and accurate history about the preceding events may be limited [13, 15]. Likewise, donors may have undergone extensive resuscitation and/or a prolonged hospitalization that will affect donor screening and infectious risk\u2014secondary to hemodilution as discussed above or by introduction of infection at the time of transfusion [7, 11]. There may be a significant time frame between initial screening and organ donation in the case of a living donor. As such, consideration of repeat testing closer to the time of the transplantation should be considered, and current policy recommends that HIV, HBV, and HCV screening of all living donors be performed within 28 days of the transplant [65]. When time allows, donors may be treated for potentially transmissible infections, such as latent TB, prior to the transplant, decreasing the transmission risk. Lastly, the period of time between initial evaluation and transplantation allows one to screen living donors with risk factors for contracting blood-borne viral infections, such as HIV, HBV, and HCV. In increased risk living donors, as defined by the 2013 Public Health Services Guidelines [20], counseling to abstain from the increased risk behaviors and repeat NAT and serologic testing over a period of time similar to the window period for the virus of interest should be considered to minimize the risk of an occult transmission [20].",

Current policy requires only sputum gram stain and description of sputum for lung donors and does not require collection of BAL specimens for cultures (although only bacterial cultures are frequently done by some OPOs, viral, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures are typically not obtained) [66]. As of December 2014, NAT is required for HCV screening of all donors and for HIV screening of increased risk donors only. Positive NAT results suggest active viremia; as such appropriate measures need to be in place for appropriate consent and prophylaxis of and follow-up of recipients for transmission events if viremic donor organs are to be used. Negative NAT does not rule out infection, although it may suggest a lower risk of transmission.",

The presence of antibodiesto WNV does not predict risk of infection, as they are present in those with prior WNV infection or related flaviviruses. As such, detection of virus in the blood by molecular testing predicts increased risk of transmission, although there have transmissions with negative NAT [7, 11, 71]. A 2008 survey revealed that 11/58 OPOs were currently testing donors for WNV by PCR, typically performing testing in seasons when virus would be predicted in the donor service area [72]. Universal testing may be associated with loss of organs and net loss of life in transplant candidates [73]. A more effective screen is to avoid the use of donors with unexplained encephalitis or unexplained mental status change, but unfortunately donors may be completely asymptomatic and carry the infection [7, 11, 68]. Since transmission of other neuropathogens and malignancies has been associated with patients with unexplained encephalitis, avoidance of these donors is prudent in general [13, 15, 16, 31, 74, 75]. If donor testing is utilized, it should be restricted to NAT of the donor blood during periods of time when there are WNV cases in the region from which the donor resided [54]. Use of donor WNV serology or testing of urine for WNV is not recommended at this time.",

Since the approved serologic tests lack specificity, confirmatory testing is recommended; patients with confirmed positive serologic screening should be evaluated by an expert in Chagas disease before proceeding for transplantation [53, 67]. Strongyloides is a parasitic infection that is endemic to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Infection may remain latent after initial infection with risk of potentially lethal hyperinfection in immunosuppressed patients, particularly those who receive steroids [79]. Reactivation with associated mortality has been well described in the setting of solid organ transplantation [79, 80]. As a result, serology for strongyloides and/or testing of stool for ova and parasites should be considered in all at-risk transplant candidates [80]. Lastly, some centers test patients who have lived in areas with high endemicity for Coccidioides immitis for serologic exposure to the fungus [81].

Detailed recommendations about transplant candidate and recipient vaccination are made elsewhere (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-28797-3_48). Patients who do not have evidence of hepatitis B immunity should receive three doses of HBV vaccine unless contraindicated. Although the traditional regimen of vaccination at months 0, 1, and 6 is used by most centers, there is evidence that an accelerated regimen using double doses of vaccine (at days 0, 7, and 21 or weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6 or months 0, 1, and 2) may provide similar efficacy in a shorter period of time [85\u201387]. Serologic evidence of protection, as demonstrated by HBs antibody seropositivity, would potentially allow the use of a core-positive alone or HBV-infected organ in a protected recipient. Likewise, patients without prior exposure to varicella-zoster virus are at increased risk of severe infection if exposed posttransplant. Nonimmune transplant candidates should be vaccinated against varicella unless they have a contraindication to vaccination. Lastly, although there are not a lot of data regarding measles and mumps posttransplant, given recent outbreaks of these diseases in the United States and abroad, measles and mumps immunity should be ensured prior to transplantation, especially in candidates born after the vaccine era (after 1963).",

            "text": "There are currently a number of limitations to the recognition of potential donor-derived transmission events. Often, a single donor provides organs to recipients at multiple different centers or recipients that are cared for by different management teams at the same center. As a result, multiple recipients may present with similar clinical illnesses, but the clustering of this illness goes unrecognized [16]. Likewise, pathogens that are commonly recognized as causing nosocomial infections may not be recognized as a potential donor-derived infection [41, 42]. Finally, onset of disease may be of variable severity in individuals and may present with variable onset posttransplant, further challenging the recognition of donor-derived transmission [11, 15, 90]. To overcome these challenges, it is critical that all transplant centers:Maintain a high level of suspicion for donor-derived infection in all early infections or unexplained clinical illnesses. Any early infection or unexplained clinical illness should lead to an inquiry as to the clinical status of other recipients. This is most easily done through contact with the local OPO. This is especially true for patients with unexplained neurological or severe illness within the first 30\u201360 days posttransplant.Develop a plan for reporting concern for a potential donor-derived infection transmission. This plan should include a local contact at the transplant center and at the OPO when there is concern for a potential donor-derived infection transmission. Likewise, it is important to consider the transplant center\u2019s risk management policies to determine if others within your institution need to be alerted. This plan should also include whom the OPO should contact at your center if there are questions about the status of recipients based on queries generated from other centers. Some have found appointing a specific surgeon and transplant infectious disease consultant as the early points of contact facilitate the clear transmission of data.Provide timely feedback about your patients when information is requested by the OPO.Seek outside expertise, through your local health department, UNOS\u2019s Disease Transmission Advisory Committee, and the Center for Disease Control\u2019s Office of Blood, Organ, and other Tissue Safety. These groups can advise on optimal testing, help collect appropriate specimens, and may provide insight into similar cases that allow the local center to make more informed treatment decisions.\n",

            "text": "Current mandated donor screening for hepatitis B includes detection of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and core antibody (HBcAb). HBsAg is a marker of active viremia while HBcAb is a marker of exposure to hepatitis B virus. Since HBV vaccine only contains hepatitis B surface antigen, vaccinated donors should only have HBV surface antibody (HBsAb), but not HBcAb. If HBsAg is measured early after vaccination, it can be detected in the blood [97, 98]. The risk of transmission of HBV to a nonimmune recipient is high in HBsAg-positive donors [99]; use of these organs is discussed further in the chapter on Hepatitis B. Although HBsAg-positive donors may have been deferred in the past, advances in the use of hepatitis B immune globulin and anti-HBV antivirals now allow the selective use of these organs [99]. Donors that have isolated HBcAb positivity may represent latently infected individuals or a false-positive result. The risk of transmission of HBV in liver transplant recipients is higher than in non-liver recipients [100]. The risk of transmission of HBV from a donor with and isolated HBcAb is estimated to be less than 5% for non-liver recipients [55, 101, 102]. Additional testing of these donors with HBcore IgM and HBV DNA NAT would further stratify the risk of transmission, with the highest risk in the IgM+ and NAT+ donor [55]. Some centers use these organs, particularly in patients who have been vaccinated against hepatitis B [55]. When used in nonimmune patients, posttransplant vaccination is often combined with the use of either anti-HBV antiviral prophylaxis or hepatitis B immune globulin infusions [55]. All recipients, especially liver recipients, of HBsAg+ or HBcAb+ donors should be monitored closely for the presence of active viral replication with expansion of therapy based on these results [55, 103, 104].",

Therefore, the use of HCV NAT in donor screening allows for differentiation between prior HCV infection and active infection with viremia. Use of HCV-positive donors for HCV-negative recipients is currently considered only in life-threatening situations; however, HCV-positive donor organs should be considered in HCV-infected recipients [106\u2013109]. Small, likely clinically insignificant, decreases have been found in transplant graft and patient survival when HCV+ organs are used for HCV-infected recipients, but these are offset by the concomitant decrease in transplant waiting list time [108]. Mortality appears to be higher among heart recipients, so the use of HCV seropositive donors is less frequently considered [110\u2013112]. One concern relates to infecting a recipient with an additional HCV genotype that may be less responsive to antiviral therapy, since genotype results are typically not known at the time of transplant. With the advent of new and evolving data regarding direct-acting antivirals and interferon-free HCV regimens, the options to treat HCV before and after transplant are continuously changing.",

Active tuberculosis in any donor is a contraindication to donation; if a deceased donor is thought to possibly have tuberculosis, their organs should not be used unless active TB infection can be definitively ruled out [126, 128\u2013131]. Donor-transmitted TB accounts for 4% of all posttransplant cases of tuberculosis [132]. Testing for TB can be done by the PPD placed using the Mantoux method or via a TB-specific interferon-\u03b3 release assay (such as QuantiFERON-TB Gold, Cellestis Inc., Victoria, Australia) [133]. Positive testing by either method should result in careful assessment for active disease, including chest imaging and, if appropriate, sputum and/or urinary AFB cultures. Some centers will provide latent TB treatment to the recipient of organs from these donors; this decision can be individualized as transmission if not universal [77, 129, 132]. If the recipient does not receive treatment for latent TB, a note about the donor\u2019s testing should be prominent in the recipient chart to trigger aggressive evaluation with the appropriate clinical presentations (i.e., sterile pyuria, pneumonia).",
