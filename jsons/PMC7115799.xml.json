            "text": "Electron tomography (ET) is a widely used powerful technique in the field of biology revealing the interior structure of the biological samples in 3D at nanometer scale. This is achieved by collecting 2D projections of the specimen from different viewing angles. In its common application, the sample is rotated around a single axis with fixed intervals while its projections are acquired by transmission electron microscope. Then, these projections are used to reconstruct the biological sample in 3D. The accuracy and the resolution of the reconstruction are limited by two major factors: (1) due to the mechanical and physical limitations, the projections typically collected only from \u00b160\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 tilt angle range are used in the reconstruction (missing wedge problem). (2) The signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the projection data is low since the total amount of applied electrons is limited in order to prevent radiation damage to the biological sample imaged.",

They are able to use a priori information to compensate for the imperfection and incompleteness of the measurements. Any structural or statistical information about the sample or the imaging conditions can be utilized to improve the reconstruction process. These methods try to satisfy the fidelity of the reconstruction to the measurements and utilize the prior information at the same time. The balance between the data fidelity and the prior information is controlled by the regularization parameter. The value of this parameter highly affects the visual quality of the reconstructed image. Its optimum value depends on several factors, such as the noise level, sample variation, resolution, and validity of the prior information.",

One of these methods, the l-curve method, analyzes the images reconstructed for different values of regularization parameter [1]. For each reconstruction, the relationship between the squared norm of the solution and the squared norm of the residual error is analyzed to find the optimum regularization parameter. A similar approach, S-curve method, was implemented for wavelet-based reconstruction [2] and total variation regularization [3] making the assumption that the reconstructed data is sparse in wavelet domain and gradient domain, respectively. Both L-curve and S-curve methods require multiple reconstructions of the data with different regularization parameters, which heavily increases the computational cost of the overall image reconstruction. In another method, Wen and Chan used discrepancy principle for total variation regularization in the image restoration context [4]. Their method requires prior information about the SNR of the data, which is not always straightforward to obtain in tomographic imaging. In this study, one of our aims was to develop an adaptive regularization method, which does not require additional analysis, structural a priori information about the data nor the imaging system, or the user manipulation according to the application purpose.",

            "text": "The other aim of this paper was to reduce the computation time, which is realized by employing multiresolution reconstruction in a sequential scheme. Multiresolution reconstruction grids [5] and multiresolution detector space [6] was used previously to improve the convergence rate of maximum likelihood expectation maximization (ML-EM) method in positron emission tomography (PET). It was also utilized in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) [7] and discrete tomography that reconstructs images composed of small number of intensity levels representing only a few different materials [8]. In this paper, we use the multiresolution method in electron microscopy for the reconstruction of biological specimens with maximum a posteriori probability expectation maximization (MAPEM) method. Multiresolution approach introduced in MAPEM reconstruction enables the weight of the regularization to vary from strong to weak throughout the reconstruction. One reason is that the image size is increased during the reconstruction while the regularization filter size is fixed. The other reason is the number of binned projection data and so its averaging effect decreases throughout different resolution stages. By decreasing noise with these two mechanisms, the reconstruction converges smoothly to a coarse estimate of the reconstructed image at the first resolution stages. Then the number of binned pixels is decreased step by step to improve the resolution of the estimates. Since each step is initialized with a spatially coarse estimate of the image, they give better results in fewer iterations compared to initialization with an image of random or constant value. The computations take shorter time also because the calculations are faster in the smaller reconstruction grids used in the lower resolution stages. We developed the adaptive regularization method first as a parameter-free reconstruction process and then introduced the multiresolution approach to obtain the final adaptive multiresolution reconstruction method.",

The method assumes Poisson distribution to model the image to be reconstructed and median filter (median root prior, [11]) to regularize the iterations. Instead of using one constant regularization parameter value, the method used a sequence of these in the decreasing order. At each regularization stage, predefined number of iterations was performed with constant regularization parameter value. The initial stages with high values of regularization parameters provided a rough but robust estimate of the image for the following stages by highly suppressing the noise. The regularization parameter value was decreased to enhance the resolution and contrast of the final reconstructed image. This sequential method was consistently superior to the conventional reconstruction methods, weighted back-projection (WBP) and a simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT), in terms of accuracy and noise suppression due to its capability of filling the missing wedge [12]. However, sMAPEM has some parameters, which affect the final resolution, the final contrast, and the visual impression of the reconstruction result. The number of regularization stages, the number of iterations per each stage, and the regularization parameters need to be set properly by the user according to the data and the application. Moreover, the method requires a long computation time.",

In this way, noise was highly suppressed in the reconstruction in the first regularization stages to have coarse but robust estimate of the structure. In the following stages, the regularization parameter value was decreased to enhance the resolution and contrast of the estimate. In addition to changing the regularization parameter value adaptively to control the noise penalization, adaptive multiresolution MAPEM (amMAPEM) reconstruction method changes the reconstruction image size while keeping the filter size constant. In our experiments, we fixed the window size of the filter to its smallest value (3\u00d73) in order to minimize the loss of resolution due to filtering (The reader may refer to [11] for the effect of different filter sizes on MRP regularization). The same size of filter affects the small size image more strongly than the large one. With amMAPEM method, the strength of the penalization filter is weakened by increasing the image size stage by stage sequentially. The advantage of this approach is its computational efficiency.",

The information source for the interpolation is the relation of the pixel values in the local neighborhood. The filter preserves the edges in the spatial domain while using this information. The reader may refer to the previous studies for the detailed analysis of gap filling capability of sMAPEM in comparison with the conventional reconstruction methods [12], [13].

Since there is a large block of information gap and SNR is low in ET, updating the image using even sparser subsets of projection data can exaggerate noise throughout the iterations. Therefore, we utilized the multiresolution approach instead of OS to reduce the computation time. It was shown with the phantom and experimental datasets that the computation time is much shorter for amMAPEM than for sMAPEM. The multiresolution reconstruction also contributed to the visual quality of the reconstruction results in addition to computation time acceleration. Its averaging effect and usage together with the median filter suppressed noise throughout the iterations.
