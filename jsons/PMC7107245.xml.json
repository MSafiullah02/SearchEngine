            "text": "Newcastle disease (ND) is a highly contagious poultry disease caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV). The disease is characterized by nervous, respiratory, enteric, and reproductive infections, and the agent has been classified by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as a notable disease-causing virus (Hoffmann et al., 2009). Similarly, infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute and highly contagious viral respiratory disease caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) characterized by wet eyes, swollen face, respiratory disease, tracheal and kidney lesions, reduced weight gain in broilers, decreased production, and poor egg quality in layers (Brown and Bevins, 2017; Shirvani, et al., 2018). These 2 diseases can have destructive economic effects on the world domestic poultry production, and outbreaks have been commonly reported in recent years (Pitangui Mendonca et al., 2009; Umar, 2017). Vaccination with a live bivalent vaccine of NDV and IBV is one of the most common approaches to control the diseases. However, poor immune responses to vaccination have been reported and cause incomplete protection (Kapczynski et al., 2013; Jordan, 2017; Rauw et al., 2017; El-Dabae et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Adjuvants are known to improve the efficacy of vaccines (Meunier et al., 2016). Our previous studies have showed that saponins extracted from the stem-leaf of Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer (GSLS) added an adjuvant effect to vaccine. Zhai et al. (2011b, 2014) observed that oral administration of GSLS has capacity to improve vaccination against ND, avian influenza, and infectious bursal disease in chicken. Yu et al. (2015b) found that oral administration of GSLS had capacity to recover the chickens\u2019 immunity with oxidative stress by showing increased antibody response to NDV and avian influenza virus (AIV), splenocyte proliferation, and intestinal IgA+ cells and ilELs. Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for animals and plays a crucial role in immunity. Studies have suggested a close relation between selenium and the immunity in chickens (Wang et al., 2018a,b). We hypothesized that combination of GSLS and Se could boost the immune responses and improved the immunization. However, no report has been found regarding the combined effect of GSLS and Se on vaccination. As a live vaccine is usually supplied in a form of lyophilized powder, it needs to be resuspended in a saline solution before use. In this study, we used a solution containing GSLS and Se as a diluent to resuspend a live bivalent vaccine of NDV and IBV and evaluate the adjuvant effect of the diluent on the immune responses in chickens.",

To control these diseases on commercial chicken farms in China, a live bivalent vaccine of NDV and IBV is usually used for vaccination. The vaccine is generally supplied in form of lyophilized powder and diluted in PSS before use. But feeble immunity has been frequently found in chicken flocks, leading to poor immune protection. For examples, Berhanu et al. (2010) reported sporadic outbreaks of NDV in Malaysia, remaining a constant threat to commercial poultry in spite of routine vaccination programs; Pitangui Mendonca et al., (2009) observed that periodical outbreaks of IBV in densely populated poultry regions in Brazil where routine vaccination against IBV was carried out.

Ni et al. (2016) found attenuated pseudorabies virus (aPrV) vaccine diluted in PSS containing GSLS and thimerosal instead of PSS alone induced a significantly higher immune response. El-Dabae et al. (2018) discovered that subcutaneous injection NDV vaccine together with ginseng saponins in chickens was effective to protect chickens against an Egyptian field NDV strain and had capacity to reduce the shedding of the virus. Selenium is an essential element and usually used as a dietary supplement for growth and productivity in poultry. Singh et al. (2006) observed chickens receiving supplements of selenium together with vitamin E enhanced significantly higher HI antibody titers and heavier spleen and bursa after immunizing against NDV vaccine. Lee et al.

Rao et al. (2016) reported that supplement of organic selenium in diet had positive effect on anti-oxidant, performance, and immune responses in broilers in tropical summer. Hu et al.

Chickens with HI or antibody titers lower than the minimum are susceptible to infections of NDV and IBV. Figure 2 shows MDA declined below the minimum at 18 days old for HI titer to NDV while 15 days old for antibody titer to IBV after hatched chickens. An incubation period is needed for a vaccine to induce a protective immune response. Ganapathy et al. (2006) reported NDV HI antibody titers in commercial chickens began to rise after 14 D post immunizing with live vaccine of NDV via a intraocular-and-intraoral route. To induce the immune responses higher than the minimum protective antibody titers, it took 12 D for NDV-specific HI titers and 18 D for IBV-specific antibody titer when the vaccine was resuspended in PSS while it took only 9 D for NDV and 15 D for IBV when the vaccine was resuspended in a solution containing GSLS-Se (Figure 2), indicating that GSLS-Se promoted early production of the vaccine-induced antibodies and shortened the incubation period.",

Lymphocyte proliferation is often used to evaluate the lymphocytes in humoral and cellular immune responses (Chaplin, 2006). There are T and B subsets of lymphocytes, and response of different subsets depends on the mitogen used. T cells are responsive to Con A, whereas B cells are responsive to LPS (Tizard, 2009). In this study, proliferative responses to Con A or LPS of lymphocytes isolated from chickens immunized with vaccine resuspended in PSS with GSLS-Se were significantly increased when compared with the group immunized with vaccine resuspended in PSS alone (Figure 3), indicating that both T and B lymphocytes were activated. The increased cell proliferative response to NDV stimulation paralleled the elevated serum NDV-specific antibody in the group using PSS containing GSLS-Se as a diluent.",
