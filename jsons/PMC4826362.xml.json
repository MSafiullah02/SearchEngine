            "text": "Despite continued efforts and significant advances in critical care medicine, septic shock remains a significant health problem with a mortality rate around 35 % [1, 2]. Septic shock is defined as sepsis accompanied by cardiovascular failure that is often a part of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [3]. Thus, septic shock represents an extreme manifestation of the host inflammatory response to severe infection. Transcription of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and reactive oxygen species is strongly activated by the transcriptional factor NF-\u03baB and contributes to the development of MODS [4, 5]. NF-\u03baB is an ubiquitous family of inducible dimeric homodimer or heterodimer transcriptional factors composed by five members: Rel (c-Rel), RelA (p65), RelB, NF-\u03baB1 (p50/p105) and NF-\u03baB2 (p52/p100) [6].",

            "text": "The role of RelA in severe infection is well established, as it is highly recruited to the promoter of pro-inflammatory genes in non-survivors of septic shock [7, 8]. The cRel subunit was the least studied member of the Rel family, but seems to have also a critical role in the antimicrobial host defense. Indeed, in vivo studies revealed that cRel is required for macrophage activation [9, 10], adaptive immunity [11] and the control of lymphocyte proliferation [12, 13]. cRel is also a key regulator of numerous cytokines: IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IL-15, IL-21, IFN-\u03b3, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb, MIP1-\u03b1 and GM-CSF [9, 14\u201319]. More recently, in a murine model of polymicrobial sepsis, Rel deficiency led to an increased mortality, an enhanced systemic inflammatory response and a sustained depletion of spleen lymphoid dendritic cells [9\u201312, 20]. Furthermore, whole blood transcriptomics showed that cRel targets inflammatory and survival genes during sepsis [13, 20]. Moreover, genetic variants within the REL locus have been associated with inflammatory diseases or autoimmunity in Europeans [21]. Even if no study reports the importance of cRel in human sepsis, these elements highlight the potential importance of cRel for NF-\u03baB targeted-immunomodulation in severe infections.",

Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been characterized in genes of NF-\u03baB pathway proteins. For instance, SNPs in TLRs [22\u201324], TIRAP [25], IRAK1 [26, 27], I\u03baB [28] and NF-\u03baB inducing kinase (NIK) [29] genes have been associated with severity of sepsis. However, the association between genetic variants in NF-\u03baB subunits and severe infections has been poorly reported. Hence, the present study aims to test the hypothesis of an association between clinically significant REL genetic variants and severity of septic shock in a large cohort of well-defined intensive care unit (ICU) patients.",

Briefly, patients were eligible for inclusion into the septic shock group (SS) if they had, within their stay in ICU, a clinical evidence of infection with two of four SIRS criteria (fever (>38.2 \u00b0C) or hypothermia (<36 \u00b0C); tachycardia (>90 beats/min); tachypnea (>20 breaths/min) or need of mechanical ventilation; white cell count >12 \u00d7 109/L) and if, after an adequate fluid resuscitation, they required vasopressor infusion (norepinephrine, epinephrine or dopamine >8 \u03bcg/kg/min) to maintain a mean arterial pressure higher than 60 mmHg. Exclusion criteria included comorbidities highly associated with death in SS [32]: age above 85 years, cardiac failure (NYHA class III or IV), liver insufficiency (child C), bone marrow aplasia or leucopenia not related to septic shock (white blood cell count <0.50 \u00d7 109/L), immunosuppression (HIV, current immunosuppressive therapy including steroids with equivalent prednisone >0.5 mg/kg per day) or ongoing cancer with undergoing treatment.",

Real-time PCR allelic discrimination assays were realized by TaqMan\u00ae method on Abi 7900 (Applied Biosystems\u00ae). Probe and primer combinations were designed to discriminate the two REL SNPs (rs842647 and rs13031237). Quality control for genotyping was performed by automatic sequencing 12 patients carrying the different REL genotypes in order to confirm allelic discrimination results and also by re-genotyping 20 % of the entire cohort.

The intronic rs842647 SNP was linked to a higher risk of Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis [40] and celiac disease [41, 42] and primary sclerosing cholangitis [43]. Genome-wide studies have also found that REL locus was associated with psoriasis [37, 44], rheumatoid arthritis [37], ulcerative colitis [45, 46] and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma [47]. However, functional and structural effects of these polymorphisms are still unknown and need to be investigated.

            "text": "The higher rate of mortality observed in SS patients carrying rs842647*G might be linked to a higher inflammatory state, as they also developed more frequently MODS. They also tend to have more ARDS and lower VFDs however not significant, but this is most likely underpowered, as VFDs are not normally distributed. Mortality in septic shock was partially related to hyper-activation of NF-\u03baB [7, 48]. In this setting, previous genetic studies on several gain of function SNPs in genes of receptors and signaling molecules upstream of NF-\u03baB, such as TLR1 and IRAK1 [22, 26], showed a significant association with severity of sepsis. These genetic factors might unbalance the fine-tune regulation toward a hyper-inflammatory deleterious state. However, the exact role of cRel on inflammatory processes is less understood in humans. Recent studies have shown that cRel could be involved in autoimmunity, such as inflammatory arthritis [49] and autoimmune encephalomyelitis [50]. More recently, cRel was shown to have a key role in antimicrobial defense processes. Rel\u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible to Leishmania major [9] or Toxoplasma gondii infections [10], to viral infection by Influenza virus [11], to bacterial infection by Listeria monocytogenes [12] and to polymicrobial sepsis [20]. cRel is probably important in pro-/anti-inflammatory balance as Rel\u2212/\u2212 mice seemed to have an enhanced inflammatory response [20].",

            "text": "The study design quality is important for a right interpretation of genetic association studies [35]. We tried to follow closely these quality criteria. First, it is important to select a SNP of a protein involved in the physiopathology of the disease. As already mentioned, REL seems to be an interesting gene to study because NF-\u03baB plays a central role in physiopathology of sepsis, and recent studies show the importance of cRel in this context. However, one important limit of our study is the absence of data regarding the functional effect of these two SNPs. Functional data are needed to improve our understanding of how rs842647*G variant of REL is related to sepsis severity. Second, the population homogeneity has been controlled by limiting the study on European patients without severe comorbidities. The third item is probably one of the more controversial in the sepsis field: choice of a clearly defined phenotype to avoid confusion factors. Thus, we have selected only patients with septic shock whose diagnosis and treatment are standardized [3], and these patients had no major comorbidity or immunosuppressive treatment, severe autoimmune diseases in particular, that could have been confounding the results. However, it is impossible to rule out effects of confounding factors or gene\u2013environment interactions in our results, and septic shock is heterogeneous with regard to the source of infection. Sample size is essential for statistics quality in association study but is difficult to achieve in pure septic shock population. At our knowledge, our cohort is one of the largest ever published populations in this topic and is large enough to diminish type I error. It is important to consider that after correction for multiple testing, our result only reached near significance. \u0160id\u00e1k/Bonferroni correction assumes, however, that markers are independent, whereas the SNPs studied here are in LD and are therefore not truly independent from each other. As a result, though we tried to take into account LD by the calculation of Meff, the adjustment is likely to overcorrect in this case. We therefore consider that our preliminary results would need a validation in independent cohorts. Finally, this genetic association study is limited to one gene. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are now discovering new unsuspected genes that might have an impact on sepsis outcome [51].",

Further studies are needed to investigate the functional role of this REL polymorphism on the inflammatory processes observed in sepsis and to validate these encouraging results in independent cohort.",
