To date, there are limited data regarding the true rate of IFD, the RFs for specific respiratory virus infection, and the most critical period for IFD development after CARV infections in allo\u2010HSCT recipients.",

In cases with a new onset of respiratory symptoms in which we detected the same virus from the prior CARV episode along with another newly emerging CARV, we considered it as a new co\u2010viral infectious disease episode. In contrast, cases in which we detected a CARV and the recipient had long\u2010lasting respiratory symptoms that were re\u2010screened during follow\u2010up testing positive for a new emerging CARV along with the initial CARV were considered as a unique co\u2010viral CARV infectious disease episode.",

In five out of 29 cases (17%), IFD was diagnosed at median of 109 days (range 66 to 158 days) after the initial CARV diagnosis. However, these cases had long\u2010lasting respiratory symptoms and repeated PCR test detected the same CARV subtype in the two months before the diagnosis of IFD. All the IFDs involved the lungs, and in 26 (89%) cases, the diagnostic was IA, meeting criteria of probable (n = 24) or proven (n = 2). Probable IA cases had GM index in blood (n = 18) and/or BAL (n = 11) above the threshold values. The remaining 3 patients developed proven pulmonary invasive fungal disease caused by Cladophialopora carrionii (isolated from 2 consecutive BAL cultures and confirmed in the autopsy), scedosporium apiospermum (BAL culture), and mucor racemosus (diagnosed in autopsy). Patients\u2019 clinical and biological characteristics according to whether they developed IFD are shown in Table 3. The IFD group had significantly higher rates of factors included in the ISI score (lymphopenia, active GVHD, steroid therapy) (P \u2264 .05 for all comparisons). Of note, 26 out of 29 IFD (91%) occurred within the first year after transplantation. The overall rate of IFD after CARV was 5%, whereas this rate was higher in recipients developing CARV during the first year of transplant (7%). IFD was diagnosed in 25 out of 203 LRTD episodes (12%) compared to 4 out of 394 URTD episodes (1%) (P = .0001). Out of 133 CARV episodes involving the LRTD within the first year after transplant, 23 (17%) developed IFD. We found no differences in IFD rates according to CARV type (Table 2).",

Data from retrospective series reported rates of IFD after CARV in allo\u2010HSCT recipients as ranging from 18% to 41%.5, 33 However, our IFD rates vary according to CARV location (URTD or LRTD), time of CARV diagnosis, and presence of concurrent RFs. In this sense, the IFD rate in recipients with URTD was 1%, whereas it was 12% in those with LRTD. The IFD rate was even higher (17%) in recipients developing a CARV LRTD during the first year after stem cell infusion. Our data show that IFD rates were lower than previously reported ones. These differences may be explained by potential selection bias introduced in retrospective studies, since it is likely that mostly severe cases were included. In contrast, our data came from a prospective CARV survey that made it possible to detect a high number of CARV episodes (in particular mild and moderate cases) leading to the more representative rates reported herein. Of note, this study was conducted in the setting of antifungal prophylaxis during the period at higher risk (first 3 months after transplant and/or while on corticosteroids therapy).

This finding is not surprising, since ATG produces lymphopenia and a significant deferral in T\u2010cell immune reconstitution for longer than a year after stem cell infusion.36, 37 ATG has been previously identified as a RF for IA.5 In fact, Aspergillus\u2010specific CD4+ T\u2010cell activity has been recognized as significant in regulating active pulmonary inflammation and likely adding antifungal effector activity.38, 39, 40 Another potential explanation could be that ATG in our series was mainly used in the context of single CBU transplantation (78% of overall ATG use) and this procedure has been consistently associated with higher incidence of IFD than other sources of hematopoietic stem cells.41\n",
