The human microbiome project (HMP) was launched by NIH in 2007 as a part of a road map for medical research. The HMP serves as a template for researchers who are studying more than 1,000 microbial genomes with a focus on their role in health and disease. The study samples have been derived from five human body regions that are known to be inhabited by microbial flora. These include the gastrointestinal tract, female urogenital tract, mouth, nose, and skin. The techniques being used include finger printing, sequencing, dynamic range, and comparison of multiple samples. It is now well accepted that there are more microbial cells than human cells in the human body. Just the gastrointestinal tract harbors more than tenfold microbial cells than the number of human cells in the entire body. The understanding of the relationship between microbes and humans is at best rudimentary at this point in time. Similarly, the relationship between humans and microbes in the environment and environmental surfaces is poorly understood except for a few pathogenic microbes.",

In the area of infectious diseases and infection control, we typically look at individual diseases caused by single organisms. Conventionally microbes are thought of as bad actors because the emphasis is on disease rather than interaction between human and microbial cells. The protective role of a large number of bacterial species that exist on and around us has largely been minimized. In fact, these bacteria should be referred to as \u201cNature\u2019s Bioshield.\u201d Their association with the areas they were put in by nature is strong and symbiotic. Since they are common to healthy individuals, their transmission from person to person is of no relevance. We know now that the disruption of this bioshield by physical injury and its alteration by the selection process from antibiotic use are the most significant risk factors for developing infectious diseases including those caused by multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their transmission to others in the health-care as well as community settings.",

            "text": "The transmission from person to person was proven even before the germ theory of disease was proven. For example, in 1841, Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician, attempted to mandate hand washing and change of coats used in autopsy rooms before examining patients or performing deliveries. He believed that invisible agents can be transferred particularly from autopsy room to delivery room thus infecting mothers during birthing. He built this belief from his observation that the death rates in the ward that was run by physicians were 18 % more than that in the ward run by midwives. He contributed that to the fact that physicians were working in autopsy rooms and the midwives were not. Also one of his colleagues died after he cut himself during an autopsy on a patient who had died from puerperal fever/sepsis. His colleagues did not accept the concept despite the fact that the death rate in the hospital dropped by 66 % after applying the two interventions. It is difficult to comprehend why Dr. Semmelweis faced opposition despite the success of his measures. The question was and remains today: Is it hard to apply these practices or are we not able to meaningfully convey the principles?",

These postulates were formalized by Koch himself between 1884 and 1890. Concurrent with establishing the pathogenicity of the limited number of bacteria, the transmission pathways and their interruption were being conceived also. Joseph Lister and John Snow contributed significantly to the acceptance of germ theory.",

Perhaps this is because the consequences of noncompliance are not obvious right away and it is hard to point to a single action that caused the incident. It is a fact that those we ask to comply with infection prevention practices do not have a clear understanding of the microbial world at large and therefore the principles. This has made it difficult and at times impossible to have an optimal adherence with these practices. We believe that it is absolutely necessary to convey to health-care providers of all levels the significance of the microbial flora on and around us, the factors that put them at risk for acquiring and subsequently transmitting disease-causing pathogens to patients at high risk of developing infectious processes due to multiple factors including age, immunocompromise, and comorbid conditions. With that in mind the rest of this chapter will provide an overview of bacteria, viruses, prions, fungi, and parasites with focus on modes of transmission and therefore the modes of prevention of transmission. The details of the procedures to reduce transmission in the health-care settings will be provided in the following chapters.",

Three stages of HIV infection have been described. The initial stage of infection (primary infection), which occurs within weeks of acquiring the virus, is characterized by a flu- or mono-like illness that is seen in about half of the patients and generally resolves within weeks. In this stage there is a rapid increase in plasma viremia, with high viral titers and widespread dissemination targeting lymphoid organs especially the GART. The patients are highly contagious in this stage. This phase is followed by a marked reduction in the virus to steady-state levels probably because of vigorous antivirus cellular responses. The immune response probably accounts for the mono-like or flu-like acute retroviral syndrome. The second stage, a chronic asymptomatic infection lasts an average of 8\u201310 years. The third stage is the acquired immune deficiency syndrome stage in which the patient is at high risk for opportunistic infections, cancers, severe weight loss, and dementia. The most common modes of infection are sexual transmission at the genital or colonic mucosa, exposure to other infected fluids such as blood or blood products, transmission from mother to infant, and, occasionally, accidental occupational exposure. Due to rapid genetic changes in the virus, there is as yet no vaccine against this infection.

During the chronic phase, manifestations range from an asymptomatic carrier state to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. When symptomatic, a patient with acute infection may have anorexia, nausea, jaundice, and right upper quadrant discomfort that lasts from 1 to 3 months, and 5 % of adults will develop chronic disease compared to 90 % if infected at birth [35]. The method of acquiring HBV infection varies geographically. Perinatal transmission is most common in high prevalence areas such as the southeast Asia and China, while sexual contact and percutaneous transmission (e.g., intravenous drug use) are most common in the United States, Canada, and western Europe. Vaccination is highly effective (90 % effectiveness in immunocompetent) and it can be given safely to pregnant women. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all children receive their first dose of hepatitis B vaccine at birth and complete the vaccine series by age 6\u201318 months. Older children and adolescents who did not previously receive the hepatitis B vaccine should also be vaccinated. After exposure to hepatitis B virus (HBV), whether it is occupational or nonoccupational, appropriate and timely prophylaxis can prevent HBV infection and subsequent development of chronic infection or liver disease. People who completed hepatitis B vaccine series and did not receive post-vaccination testing should receive a single booster vaccine dose, while unvaccinated persons should receive both hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after exposure (preferably within 24 h).

Prion diseases are neurodegenerative diseases that have long incubation periods and progress rapidly once clinical symptoms appear. Five human prion diseases are currently recognized: kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), Gerstmann-Stra\u00fcssler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI). Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), one of a number of prion infections affecting animals, was responsible for bringing these agents to more widespread public attention because of its link to vCJD. Prion diseases appear to result from neurotoxic accumulation of abnormal isoforms of the prion protein. The gene encoding the prion protein in humans is located on the short arm of chromosome 20. A strong link was established between mutations in this gene and forms of prion disease with a familial predisposition (familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Stra\u00fcssler-Scheinker syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia). The two diseases that are thought to be due to transmission of prions are kuru and vCJD. In kuru, symptoms begin with tremors, ataxia, and postural instability followed by loss of ambulation and involuntary movements. Dementia progresses in the late stages of the disease, with death typically occurring within 9\u201324 months from the onset. It is felt to be transmitted from person to person. Cannibalism which was common in New Guinea in the past could be the reason why it was endemic there. Now as this practice has been stopped, kuru has become rare. vCJD presents with a progressive course of cognitive decline with prominent neuropsychiatric features often accompanied by sensory symptoms and leads to death after an average of 14 months. Transmission to humans occurs through ingestion of infected bovine meat products. There is no person-to-person transmission, but it can occur during invasive medical interventions. One of the characteristic features of prions is their resistance to a number of usual decontaminating procedures. Private room and other measures are not required for infection control. But for surgical procedures on any person with confirmed or suspected prion diseases, every effort should be made to plan carefully not only the procedure but also the infection prevention practices surrounding the procedure, e.g., instrument handling, storage, cleaning and decontamination, or disposal. Written protocols are essential.",

Malaria is the most important parasitic disease of humans, with transmission in over 100 countries affecting close to three billion people and causing one to two million deaths each year [36]. The initial symptoms and signs are nonspecific and may include tachycardia, tachypnea, chills, malaise, fatigue, diaphoresis, headache, cough, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Then periodic attacks of fever occur 48\u201372. Complications are due to severe anemia and capillary plugging from an adhesion of infected red blood cells with each other and endothelial lining of capillaries resulting in hypoxic injury to the brain and kidney. This occurs especially in P. falciparum infection where the parasitemia is more severe compared to the other species. Malaria is transmitted via the bite of a female Anopheles mosquito, which occurs mainly between dusk and dawn. Other comparatively rare mechanisms for transmission include congenitally acquired disease, blood transfusion, sharing of contaminated needles, and organ transplantation. In areas where malaria is endemic, the groups at high risk for severe malaria and its consequences include young children (6\u201336 months) and pregnant women. Older children and adults develop partial immunity after repeated infections and are at relatively low risk for severe disease. As disease incidence wanes, older age groups will become more susceptible due to decreasing immunity. Travelers to areas where malaria is endemic generally have no previous exposure to malaria parasites and are at very high risk for severe disease if infected. Modes of preventions include chemoprophylaxis and protection from mosquito bite by netting, protective clothing, and insect repellents which are also effective. Prompt diagnosis and treatment including \u201cself-treatment\u201d prevents complications.",
