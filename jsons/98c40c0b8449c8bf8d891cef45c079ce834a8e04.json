With these benefits comes the risk of pathogen transmission via the transfused blood components, making the supply of safe blood components a key mission of blood transfusion services. The introduction of screening tests for blood products strongly reduced the burden of known blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, cases of HBV and HIV transmission via blood from infected donors, which were not detected by serological screening or nucleic acid testing (NAT), have been described recently (Candotti et al., 2018; Cappy et al., 2019) . In addition, other known or unknown pathogens pose a potential threat to blood safety, with regional differences. The number of different pathogen screening tests applied in blood banks is usually limited by economic factors and availability of reliable and affordable assays. Thus, an efficacious pathogen inactivation technology is a viable alternative to serological or NAT testing as the risk of transmission of a broad spectrum of pathogens can be reduced.

Recently, a chikungunya virus outbreak in Italy severely impacted blood availability in the Lazio region, causing an officially demanded halt in platelet supply. Only those centres in the region that had the INTERCEPT technology implemented were allowed to continue platelet product preparation and could thus prevent a complete stop in platelet supply by supporting the hospitals of the entire region (Vairo et al., 2018) . The Italian outbreak, the second after the Ravenna outbreak in 2008, was yet another example of recent emerging arbovirus outbreaks in the Mediterranean, likely enabled by the spread of vectors due to global warming or increased international travel and goods exchange. The 2015/2016 Zika virus outbreak in South and Central America is another example where the high number of asymptomatic carriers made it difficult to protect the blood supply (Lanteri et al., 2016) . Although, to the best of our knowledge, transmission of MERS-CoV by blood transfusion has not yet been reported, the detection of MERS-CoV genomic RNA in the blood of infected patients raises concerns for blood safety (Stramer, 2014) . Viral genomic RNA was detected in the plasma and serum of patients during MERS-CoV outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea, giving rise to concerns about potential transmission by blood transfusion. A viral load of 3\u00b73-4\u00b72 log genomic copies per mL in whole blood and 2\u00b77-4\u00b70 log genomic copies per mL in serum was reported in South Korea (Kim et al., 2016) . Viral loads up to 6 log genomic copies per mL, which correspond to \u223c3 logs of infectious virus, in serum have also been reported during an outbreak in Saudi Arabia (Corman et al., 2016) . Although there are no reports on transfusion-related MERS-CoV transmission so far, viral RNA could be detected in patients' blood for almost two weeks post-diagnosis (Corman et al., 2016) , which may represent a possible route of transmission, especially that several studies have shown its replication in several blood cells (Chu et al., , 2016 Zhou et al., 2014) . Furthermore, the AABB lists MERS-CoV as a pathogen of concern for blood safety (Stramer, 2014) . Therefore, it is important to investigate possible ways to reduce the risk of such transmission to avoid any effects on the blood supply, especially in endemic regions such as Saudi Arabia, which could lead to deferral of donations from confirmed and suspected cases as happened before during the SARS-CoV outbreak (WHO, 2019: https://www.who.int/csr/ sars/guidelines/bloodsafety/en/).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 660, "end": 680, "text": "(Vairo et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1150, "text": "(Lanteri et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1386, "text": "(Stramer, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1748, "text": "(Kim et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1915, "end": 1936, "text": "(Corman et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2105, "end": 2126, "text": "(Corman et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2265, "end": 2284, "text": "(Chu et al., , 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2285, "end": 2303, "text": "Zhou et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2385, "end": 2400, "text": "(Stramer, 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "We have previously described the inactivation of MERS-CoV in spiked human plasma samples (Hindawi et al., 2018) with an average of 4\u00b767 log reduction in infectious titre on amotosalen/UVA treatment. In this study, we report a mean of 4\u00b748 log (4\u00b718-4\u00b785) reduction in the infectious titre of MERS-CoV in virus-spiked platelet samples, indicating that amotosalen/UVA treatment of MERS-CoV-spiked platelets can effectively inactivate the virus and potentially reduce the risk of MERS-CoV transmission through contaminated platelet units. This reduction is at least one log higher than the possible infectious titre in serum as reported previously (Corman et al., 2016) . Of note, the inactivation mechanism of the INTERCEPT treatment depends on cross-linking of nucleic acid strands, thereby preventing pathogen replication. Given the size of the amplicon, the detection of the viral genomic RNA by RT-qPCR was still possible after inactivation, and the genomic titre was only slightly affected by the pathogen inactivation treatment. This finding is not unusual as previously reported for other successfully inactivated viruses. Specifically, amotosalen/UVA light inactivation process results in cross-linking of the pathogen nucleic acid strands in a sequence-specific manner where an adduct is formed in the nucleic acids, thus inhibiting transcription and replication. However, this cross-linking is not necessarily at the site targeted by the RT-PCR. Thus, treatment is expected to affect viral replication, but the nucleic acid will remain detectable, which explains why the genomic titres are not reduced in a similar fashion as the infectivity reduction. Nonetheless, for additional safety, we assessed the presence of residual replication-competent particles. Inactivated platelet units were passaged three successive times for three days each, showing no CPE in the inactivated units. Viral genomes were also not detected after nine days (three passages), showing the loss of replication-incompetent particles during passaging and confirming the total inactivation of all viral particles in the treated platelet units.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 89, "end": 111, "text": "(Hindawi et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 645, "end": 666, "text": "(Corman et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "One major limitation of this study was the use of only four human platelets units, and subsequent studies should include larger number of samples. Although the addition of amotosalen alone without UVA light did not reduce viral titre in spiked samples (data not shown), the effect of the adsorption step alone without amotosalen and UVA light was not tested in this study and should be included in subsequent work to further determine the effect of all steps in the inactivation process. In addition, future studies should also investigate the possible effect of amotosalen and UVA light treatment on viral particles as inactivation may also be occurring via a path not directly associated with genomic alteration, such as covalent cross-linking of viral proteins or oxidative reactions induced by singlet oxygen generation from the process. Furthermore, possible virus attachment and adherence to platelets or even internalisation by platelets should be further tested. Nonetheless, our data show that the whole inactivation process is effective in reducing the risk of virus transmission via transfusion.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "A recent study has reported a reduction of \u22653\u00b77 log of MERS-CoV in spiked platelets prepared in 65% PAS and 35% plasma using UVC light (Eickmann et al., 2018) .

Although all these reports have shown marked reduction in infectious viral titres, which represent an acceptable safety margin according to the European Committee of Blood Transfusion, the presence of remaining or low levels of replication-competent virus after treatment should be investigated to confirm the complete inactivation of the virus.
