It is also used in areas where technology and resource limitations do not permit centralized wastewater treatment systems. The purpose of on-site wastewater treatment systems is to reduce the concentrations of contaminants to acceptable levels before the treated waste reaches water supplies or before people come into contact with it. Contaminants in domestic wastewater include organic chemicals (e.g., oil and grease), inorganic chemicals (e.g., heavy metals), nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus), and disease-causing microorganisms, hereafter referred to as pathogens. The focus of this article will be on the potential health effects associated with exposure to pathogenic microorganisms that may be present in domestic waste.",

Typically, some degree of decomposition of the waste material occurs on-site. On-site wastewater disposal systems include latrines and septic tanks. The advantages and disadvantages of selected on-site wastewater treatment systems are described in Table 1\n. Because the waste materials are stored on-site, these systems can pose a hazard to the underlying groundwater as the liquid portion of the material can leach through the soil, carrying contaminants to the groundwater. A more detailed description of the factors that control the potential for off-site transport of pathogens will be provided later in the text.",

It is estimated that on-site disposal systems are used to treat the wastewater for up to 20% of the population of the United States, with 20\u201325 million systems in operation. Septic tanks consist of two components. The first is an underground tank (made of concrete or some other relatively inert material), which receives the wastewater generated in the house (Figure 1\n). The solid portion of the waste settles to the bottom of the tank; decomposition of the material occurs due to the presence of naturally occurring bacteria in the material. The liquid portion passes to the second component of the treatment system, the leach field. This consists of a series of perforated pipes, which are buried below the soil surface, typically in a constructed gravel layer. The liquid material leaches through the gravel and into the underlying soil material.",

The resting stage of the organism is generally relatively resistant to inactivation during conventional wastewater treatment processes. Most of the intestinal protozoa are transmitted by fecally contaminated water, food, or other materials. The infective stage of the protozoans varies by organism.

The duration of excretion of viruses varies. Noroviruses may be excreted in feces for only a few days. However, hepatitis A viruses and hepatitis E viruses may be excreted for several months.

Indicator bacteria are bacteria that are always present in fecal material. The logic in using fecal indicator bacteria is that, if they are found to be present in water, the water contains fecal material, and therefore may also contain pathogenic microorganisms. In contrast, if fecal indicators are absent, the water is considered not to be contaminated by fecal material, and therefore no fecal pathogens are present.

However, if the microorganism survives in an infective form long enough to be transported through the soil and into the groundwater, this may be cause for concern if the water is used as a source of drinking water or used for irrigation of certain types of crops (e.g., vegetables eaten raw). Owing to their small size (\u223c25\u2013100 nm) in the environment, enteric viruses may be expected to be transported greater distances through the subsurface than bacteria and protozoa, which are generally much larger in size.

It should be noted that although all of these factors have been found to affect survival to some extent, the single factor that appears to be the most important is temperature.

Many regulatory authorities have established minimum vertical separation distances between the leach field and the seasonal height of the groundwater table. Once in the saturated zone, transport of microorganisms is much greater, and thus the goal is to limit the number of microorganisms that reach the saturated zone.

Bacteria are larger (\u223c1\u20135 \u03bc), so their transport is less than that of the viruses. Finally, the relatively large size of the parasites tends to limit their transport in soils. In addition to the size of the microorganism, the soil type is also critical in determining the extent of microbial transport. Soils with coarse textures, such as sands and gravels, have large pore sizes. These soils transmit water rapidly, and generally do not inhibit the transport of the microorganisms. Soils containing clays generally have very small pore openings between the individual soil grains, which limits not only water movement but also the transport of pathogens.",

Adsorption is the process whereby the microorganisms become attached to the soil particles, thus removing them from the bulk fluid, and at least temporarily, prohibiting their transport to the groundwater. Adsorption can be reversed if there is a change in environmental conditions, such as a rainfall event. There are a number of factors that control the extent of adsorption to the soil, including the pH of the environment and the nature of the subsurface material. Clay particles are especially efficient at adsorbing microorganisms as they contain electrical charges on their surfaces that attract oppositely charged particles. Some microorganisms, especially viruses, have an electrical charge, and thus are readily removed in soils that contain clays. Other factors that affect microbial transport are described in Table 3.",

The process is initiated on ingestion of microbially contaminated water or food; the pathogen infects the intestines. This infection can result in the production of symptoms known collectively as gastroenteritis, which includes nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Some pathogens can infect other organs, producing symptoms consistent with the nature of the specific infection (Table 2). For example, poliovirus infects the central nervous system, and can result in paralysis. Hepatitis A virus infects the liver, producing jaundice, fever, etc. Because the microorganisms are reproducing in the gastrointestinal tract, they are shed in the fecal material. If another individual directly ingests the fecal material, or ingests food or water that is fecally contaminated, that individual may also become infected, thereby perpetuating the cycle. Examples of the various routes of transmission of enteric pathogens from human and animal feces to humans are shown in Figure 2\n.",

However, there are still instances of waterborne disease in the United States that result from the use of potable water supplies that have been contaminated by septic tank leachate. In many cases, the outbreaks are the results of human error or overloading due to weather events. For example, in 1999, 781 individuals became ill (including 71 hospitalizations and 2 deaths) after consuming iced beverages at a fair in New York. The unchlorinated water was found to contain E. coli O157:H7, although the fecal samples from the infected individuals contained both E. coli O157:H7 and Campylobacter jejuni. It was found that there was a cross-connection between a septic system and the well. In 2001, 33 children in Maine became ill as a result of playing in a puddle that was formed from an overflowing septic tank and a large amount of rainfall. Although the specific cause of the acute gastroenteritis was not identified, high concentrations of the indicator microorganism, E. coli, were found in the water. In another case, 230 visitors to a snowmobile lodge in Wyoming during a 2-month period became ill with norovirus gastroenteritis. It was found that the wells that served the lodge, which were all located in proximity to a septic tank or outhouse, were contaminated with norovirus and fecal coliform bacteria. The wells were drilled in a fractured granite material, which was overlain by a very porous sand material. The loading rate exceeded the septic tank systems\u2019 capacity, and, combined with the extremely porous nature of the soil material, this resulted in rapid percolation of the waste material, allowing little filtering of the contaminants to take place. A final example demonstrates the impacts of human misjudgment. In this case, 10 individuals became ill as a result of consuming water contaminated with Cryptosporidium. The well water was typically purified using a reverse osmosis system; however, when the water supply ran low, the reverse osmosis system was intentionally bypassed. The well that was used as the source of drinking water was in an area of high septic tank density.",

If the illness is mild, as it is in many cases, no medical care is sought, and therefore there is no record of the illness. In the case of most of the enteric pathogens, the disease is not reportable, in any event. Compounding the issue is the fact that many of the enteric pathogens are also transmitted by contaminated foods, making it difficult to determine the source of the infection.",
