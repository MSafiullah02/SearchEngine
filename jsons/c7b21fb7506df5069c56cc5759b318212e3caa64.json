Physicians and non-medical prescribers are also prescribing medications (e.g. hydroxychloroquine) for potential COVID-19infections based on limited evidence. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized emergency use of hydroxychloroquine from the US national stockpile for hospitalized patients unable to participate in clinical trials 36 . Therefore, medication shortages and stock delays are a real concern 37 . Older adults are particularly vulnerable to the consequences. For example, lack of supply could lead to abrupt medication discontinuation which can cause unwanted adverse drug withdrawal effects (ADWEs). Healthcare governance systems responsible for the regulation of pharmaceuticals, are adapting quickly to address and prevent these issues 37-39 . As an example, we have summarized some key legislative changes made in Australia regarding medication supply and services in response to COVID-19 37,38(Figure 1). New Zealand introduced similar legislative/funding changes to protect health professionals and high-risk/vulnerable patients 39,40 .",
