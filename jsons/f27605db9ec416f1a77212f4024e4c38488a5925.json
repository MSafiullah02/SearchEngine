The frontline warriors, namely the doctors, nurses and healthcare staff, have in many countries struggled to care for the sick under conditions of limited resources and protection and the threat of an overwhelmed healthcare system. It is during times such as this, that we draw strength and inspiration from Florence Nightingale -a passionate statistician, social reformer, feminist champion and a pioneer of modern nursing and data visualization. Nightingale's famed Florence Nightingle Diagram also known as \"coxcomb\", which was created 150 years ago and used to display the causes of death in the British Army hospital barracks, demonstrated how data visualization techniques could be a powerful medium of communication and a force for change. This paper pays tribute to Nightingale's work by using data from Bangladesh to show that the coxcomb graph is still relevant in the era of COVID-19. The coxcomb graphs that have been produced to display COVID-19 data have provided deeper insights into the trends and relative changes of variables over the course of the pandemic. The : medRxiv preprint paper also describes codes that allow one to easily reproduce the graphs using the statistical programming language R.",

In the era of Covid-19, data visualization is particulary relevant because it is helping to shape public understanding of the pandemic. It is being used to both inform the public and policy makers as well as to persuade people to change their behaviours. The literature mentions several individuals such as Edward R.",

More than 21,000 British troops died but only 5,000 deaths were attributable to actual battle. Nightingale was relentless in her pursuits to determine why troops were dying in these hospitals. When she was appointed Superintendent of the Female Nurses in the British Military Hospital Barracks in 1854 by Sydney Herbert, the then Secretary of War, she brought with her a team of 38 volun-2 teer nurses and an innovative and determined mind (Fee & Garofalo, 2010) . Nightingale began implementing reforms in the hospital barracks. She instituted sterilized laundry and hand washing sanitation protocols, raised funds, and improved hospital administration. Moreover, during her tour in the Crimean War, Nightingale collected an impressive collection of data about mortality in the army. When she returned to England after the war, Nightingale befriended William Farr, a physician, statistician, and data visualization pioneer. He helped her recognize the potential of the data she had assembled in Crimea.",

The report was illustrated with a new type of pie diagram called the Nightingale rose or wedge diagram (Figure 1 ), which later came to be known as the Florence Nightingale diagram, coxcomb and polar area diagrams (Understanding Uncertainty, Accessed May 15, 2020). The Florence Nightingale diagrams that appeared in the report were constructed using Table (1) , which was also published in the same report (Archive, Accessed May 15, 2020) . The diagram was made up of several segments or petals where each petal represented a month. The diagram took advantage of the radii of the segments or petals in addition to their length from the center to generate areas that reflected the scale and size of the estimated mortality rate (deaths per 1000 population) of soldiers in different months. It also enabled one to discern the scale of the mortality by month relative to other months based on the area. From these graphs it was immediately evident that most of the soldiers were dying not because of combat, but due to common camp diseases, which were mitigable. This type of visual aid prompted the military to review how the soldiers were being treated and led to reform that helped to reduce non- 3 .

In as early as the Victorian age, Nightingale demonstrated how powerful data visualization can be in influencing change when intelligently used. Apart from the famous coxcomb diagram, she also created bar charts, stacked bars, honeycomb density plots, and 100% area plots (Understanding Uncertainty, Accessed May 15, 2020). She was obsessed with data quality and standardization. She orchestrated multi-year data collection efforts across the world using model survey forms of her own design.

Suppose that on average during a particular month there were S soldiers, and D of these soldiers died of diseases during that month. Nightingale considered the proportion of soldiers who died of diseases; that is, she considered the quantity D S . Next, she wished to express this quantity as a figure out of 1000, so she multiplied it by 1000, to obtain N = 1000D S . Thus, in that month, N out of every 1000 soldiers died of diseases.

However, the statistics are not visible for the first four weeks because of their low values. It can be mentioned here that in first four weeks, the total number of infections was only 61, number of deaths was 9 and the number of recovered was 30. To overcome the difficulty in visualizing the statistics of first four weeks, we divided the data into two folds-first five weeks and second five weeks. Separate coxcomb diagrams were then constructed for each group. Figure 4 shows the coxcomb diagram for the data of first five weeks. This graph is clearer and easier to understand as compared to the previous graph (i.e. Figure 3 ). This coxcomb graph is like a pie chart, cut into five equal angles each representing a week.",

For the second and third slices representing the third and fourth weeks, the blue shaded areas were much larger than the green shaded areas indicating that the recovery rates were large in these weeks relative to the death rates. But the situation reversed in the fifth week, which is when the death rate was much higher than the recovery ratean indication that the outbreak was taking a deadly turn. Figure 5 shows the coxcomb diagram for the data of the second five-week period (April 12-May 16). This graph is even easier to understand than the previous graph (i.e. Figure 4) . In this coxcomb graph, the outermost reach of each slice shows how many infections per crore occurred in that week. The radius and henceforth the area of each slice increases as we progress in the clockwise direction indicating increase in the rates of infection in successive weeks. The slices representing the 6th, 7th and 8th weeks are noticeably smaller in size than that of the 9th and 10th weeks. The coxcomb shows that there was a big jump in the infection rate from week 8 to week 9. The largest slice was for the 10th week meaning much more infections were detected during this time (i.e. maximum infection rate about 70 per crore) followed by the ninth week (i.e. maximum infection rate nearly 50 per crore). The death rates and recovery rates also appear to be considerably higher in the 9th and 10th weeks as compared to weeks 6, 7 and 8.",

By splitting the ten-week period into two five-week periods and creating separate coxcombs for each, it was possible to obseve the relative changes in the variables over time with greater detail. For instance, it was easy to discern that the rate of daily deaths per crore surpassed the rate of daily recoveries per crore in week 5.

She wrote,'Were Nightingale alive today, she would not be walking, torch in hand, among the patients of the Covid-19 hospitals named after her. She would instead be gazing intently at her laptop, her smartphone holding thousands of texts with the most influential people of the day, from the Queen and the prime minister to mathematicians and epidemiologists. Her computer would be filled with data-laden spreadsheets and she would be having a lively Twitter debate about the reliability of death figures.' Nightingale is not amongst us today, but her legacy lives on as we learn to tell the story in the data using data visualization techniques and pursue her philosophy of making data-driven decisions.",

This is the value of the area of the blue sector for the particular month that we are considering. Of course, area depends on the unit of measurement, so Nightingale will have scaled all her values appropriately. Since coxcombs do not have scales, Nightingale need not have multiplied D S by 12000 in order to plot the coxcombs.
