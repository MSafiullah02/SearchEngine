Many fibrosis related genes are also up-regulated including key collagen synthesis enzymes and fibroblast growth factor. Key TH17 initiating cytokines including TGF beta and IL-6 are also up-regulated. This explains that TH17-like immunity is initiated in ARDS. NK cell and T cell related genes are down-regulated. This explains that TH1 or TH\u03b1\u03b2 immunological pathway is not triggered in ARDS. In addition, TGFB1 and STAT5B up-regulations suggest that Treg cells play important roles in ARDS pathogenesis. (Table 1- 14) In Table 1 , it can be seen that the TLR1, 2,4,5,8 were up-regulated with the expression of IRAK4. Thus, toll-like receptor signaling is generated during ARDS. It is worth noting that TLR1,2,4,5,8 are all anti-bacteria TH17 innate immunity signaling (TLR8 is against CpG rich oligonucleotides). Thus, strong TH17-like related Toll signaling can be activated.",

In the first exudative stage, neutrophils are attracted to lung due to chemotaxic agents such as IL-8 or C5 or leukotriene B4. During sepsis, bacterial infection in pulmonary tissue can trigger pulmonary epithelial cells, pulmonary endothelial cells, pulmonary fibroblast, and alveolar macrophage to be activated. Toll-like receptors 1,2,4,5 as well as heat shock proteins (HSP60, HSP70) are key molecules to trigger TH17 host immunity (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) . Heat shock proteins are important stress proteins in situation such as burn, trauma, hemorrhagic shock, near drowning or acute pancreatitis. (27) (28) (29) (33) . First, anti-IL8-IL8 complex can be detected in 55% of healthy control serum. There is no significant difference of IL8-antiI-L8 complex between ARDS patients' serum and healthy controls' serum. In addition, IL8 autoantibody can suppress IL8 binding activity for neutrophils and it can reduce IL8's chemotaxic activity. Thus, IL8 autoantibody's importance in ARDS pathogenesis is doubtful. Bacterial infection is the most common risk factor of ARDS. However, certain pathogens other than bacteria also are risks for developing ARDS. Plasmodium falciparum malarial infection can also cause the complication of ARDS. The reason for this is that Plasmodium falciparum can activate heat shock proteins to trigger TH17 immunity to cause ARDS.(author's paper in press)(48) SARS-CoV and H1N1 Avian flu virus can also down-regulate normal anti-viral interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 and up-regulate TH17-like immunity to trigger ARDS. (author's paper in press: Viral Immunology)(49, 50) Thus, the above phenomena suggest that TH17 inflammation is the key to the pathogenesis of ARDS. If different pathogens lead to a common pathway of TH17-related innate immunity, they will cause the same consequence of ARDS. It is also seen in burn, trauma, or pancreatitis when TH17-like innate immunity is also activated.",

In addition, there is no TCR signal found in this study. Thus, TH17 adaptive immunity may not be successfully generated. This could be very important in ARDS pathogenesis. In TH17 immunity, both TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 are two important triggering cytokines. If there is no longer IL-6 signaling, only TGF-\u03b2 is generated. IL-6 is the key factor to regulate the balance between Treg cells and TH17 cells. If there is enough IL-6, Treg cells will become TH17 cells. If there is not enough IL-6, TGF-\u03b2 secreting Treg cells will be maintained. Treg cells are associated with STAT5B activation. Thus, in the third fibrosis stage, TGF-\u03b2 secreting Treg cells are the dominant effector cells in ARDS. (51) In this study, patients' ARDS is induced by bacterial sepsis. Thus, failure to induce specific adaptive immunity such as TCR and antibody cannot successfully defeat these bacteria. In the early disease stage, overactive innate immunity with PMN activation causes severe lung consolidation. In the later stage, failure of adaptive immunity against bacteria causes the abundant regulatory T cells secreting TGF-\u03b2. TGF-\u03b2 is a very strong fibrosis promoting agent and is the most important and potent stimulant in tissue fibrosis.(52, 53) TGF-\u03b2 will promote the synthesis of multiple collagen genes.(54) Thus, overproduction of TGF-\u03b2 in lung tissue will cause pulmonary fibrosis. TGF-\u03b2 caused fibrosis is usually a process for repairing cavity after bacterial infection locus such as abscess. This mechanism can solve many controversial studies before. Several studies found that TLR4 and heat shock proteins can aggravate ARDS. (20) However, another studies found that TLR4 or heat shock protein can protect from pulmonary fibrosis after acute lung injury. (55) (56) (57) It is because TLR and heat shock signaling can maintain the activation of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Thus, no sole TGF-\u03b2 overproduction happens in lung fibrosis. In an animal study, neutrophil inhibitor can attenuate the progression of acute lung injury (58) . Thus, TH17 and Treg inflammatory process can fully explain the pathogenesis of ARDS.",

            "text": "Recently, two researches suggested that Treg cells play protective roles in acute lung injury. (59, 60) We cannot agree with their suggestions. First of all, they used Rag-/mice and found that ARDS is reduced in Rag-/-mice. However, both B cells and T cells are absent in Rag-/-mice. This finding can be explained that adaptive immune T & B lymphocytes relieve the TH17 innate ARDS pathological change. They also found that CD8 T cells have protective roles in ARDS. In this study, we found that antigen specific T cells are not activated in ARDS. Thus, specific TCR or antibody response against bacteria antigen could not be successfully triggered in acute lung injury. If the adaptive immunity can be triggered, it can limit ARDS pathogenesis. Second, they used a lung injury scoring system to assess the severity of ARDS. However, the scoring system only included lung congestion and inflammatory infiltration. The most important sequel of ARDS, pulmonary fibrosis, was not included in their studies. Thus, their conclusion that TGF beta secreting Treg cells can protect ARDS is questionable .",

Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) has greater than 11 fold up-regulation. MMP8 & MMP9 play key roles in the pathogenesis of ARDS(10). In addition, MMP25, TIMP1, and TIMP2 are also up-regulated in ARDS. Thus, severe extracellular matrix destruction happens in ARDS. Fibroblast growth factors including FGF13 (5 fold up-regulation) and PDGFc (12 fold up-regulation) are also significantly expressed. Chondroitin sulfate deposition is reported in pulmonary fibrosis (11). In this study, chondroitin sulfate synthetase and chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 & 2 are also found up-regulated. There is 7.5 fold up-regulation in chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 and 13 fold up-regulation in chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2. Carboxypeptidase D, which can up-regulate nitric oxide, is also up-regulated in acute lung injury.(12) Previous studies also found up-regulation of iNOS as well as nitric oxide during the inflammation in ARDS.(13) Heparanse and heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase 1 are also up-regulated in ARDS.",

Bacterial infection can let pulmonary epithelial cells to release chemokines and cytokines.(30-32) TH17 cytokines will start to activate TH17 immunity including activating PMN effector function for immunity against extracellular bacteria. The cytokine storm during ARDS is now explained. However, in this study, it was found that CD86 costimulation signal, TCR genes, and majority of MHC genes are down-regulated in ARDS. Thus, adaptive full TH17 immunity related effective and specific antibody and TCR response against bacteria may not be triggered. However, one research found that there is IL-8 autoantibody in ARDS patients.(33) IL-8 as well as leukotriene B4 is the main chemoattractant in pulmonary tissue.(34-40) It was first identified in lung giant cell lines.(41) Besides, IL-8 has high affinity to bind to the heparin sulfate and chondroitin sulfate-enriched lung tissue.(42, 43) And, IL-8 retention in pulmonary tissue can further recruit neutrophils to lung. This can explain why IL-8 secreted from distant site such as pancreas during acute pancreatitis can cause ARDS. However, IL-8 itself is not changed in this study. And, there are several limitations in the IL8 autoantibody study",

His dataset is available in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo (accession number GSE 10474). The total number of his sepsis-induced ARDS is 13. The overall mortality of these patients is 38%. The second dataset is from GSE20189 of Gene Expression Omnibus. This dataset was collected by Dr. Melissa Rotunno in Cancer Prevention Research 2011.(7) Molecular signature of early stage of lung adenocarcinoma was studied by microarray. We use the healthy control (sample size 21) whole blood RNA from this dataset to compare the ARDS patients. In this study, we perform further analysis to study peripheral leukocyte gene expression profiles of ARDS compared to those of healthy controls. Statistical analysis Affymetrix HG-U133A 2.0 genechip was used in both samples. RMA express software (UC Berkeley, Board Institute) was used to do normalization and to rule out the outliners of the above dataset. The potential outliners of samples were removed according to the following criteria: 1. samples which have strong deviation in NUSE plot 2. samples which have broad spectrum in RLE value plot 3. samples which have strong deviation in RLE-NUSE mutiplot 4. samples which exceed 99% line in RLE-NUSE T2 plot.",
