In transplantation, all of these approaches have been applied with varying degrees of success. The revolutionary discovery that the endogenous cellular process of RNA interference (RNAi) can be artificially manipulated for inducing gene\u2010specific silencing through administration of small interfering RNA (siRNA) has led to an explosion of interest in this technique. The attractiveness of RNAi in contrast to other methods of manipulation arises from its extremely high inhibitory activity, the fact that the inhibition is very specific, and the ease with which various methods of inducing RNAi can be applied. Owing to the explosion of interest in siRNA, several others have reviewed this field concentrating on genetic mechanisms of RNAi (1), delivery methodologies (2), and effects of global gene silencing (3). In this paper we will review the therapeutic aspects of siRNA and apply them to transplant research.",

This implies that artificial induction of RNAi can be useful for silencing pathological genes in a therapeutic manner.

This phenomenon was termed \u2018cosuppression\u2019, as both the inserted gene transcript and the endogenous transcript were suppressed. The mechanism remained unclear until 1998 when Fire et al. found that the combined sense and antisense RNA led to more potent suppression of gene expression than sense or antisense used individually. The dsRNA seemed to be inducing inhibition through a pathway distinct from classical antisense inhibition, as the suppressive effect observed using the dsRNA was more potent than ever seen before. Approximately 1\u20133 molecules of duplexed RNA per cell were effective at knocking down gene expression. This seminal paper was the first to describe RNAi and to coin its name accordingly (6).",

The enzymes PKR and 2\u20325\u2032 oligosynthetase interact with dsRNA and trigger this nonspecific response. However, these problems were overcome with the discovery of the effector mechanism of gene\u2010inhibition for dsRNA in 2001. It was demonstrated that after a long dsRNA duplex enters the cytoplasm, a ribonuclease III\u2010type enzyme, termed \u2018DICER\u2019, cleaves the duplex into smaller 21\u201323 base\u2010pairs (Figure 1A). It is these small duplexes, called \u2018siRNA\u2019, that are active in silencing endogenously produced mRNA transcripts. When siRNA with homology to a mRNA transcript enters a cell, it mobilizes a self\u2010aggregating complex called RNA\u2010induced silencing complex (RISC) that then unwinds the siRNA, hybridizes with the mRNA, induces cleavage of the mRNA, and then subsequently continues performing the same process, but without the \u2018panic\u2019 response. As depicted in Figure 1 (B), administration of preformed siRNA duplexes bypasses the nonspecific activation of PKR and 2\u20325\u2032 oligosynthetase while allowing for only gene\u2010specific silencing through the stimulation of RISC.",

Owing to the short size, 21\u201323 nucleotides in length of siRNA, typical nucleotide synthesis techniques can be used. However, the production of siRNA requires several additional steps including generation of the two homologous strands, annealing of the strands in vitro, addition of chemical entities to increase stability, and ensuring that 2\u2010nucleotide overhangs are present. The purpose of these overhangs is to activate the RNAi\u2010inducing enzymatic complex (RISC). In addition, the siRNA duplex requires a\u20103\u2032 hydroxyl group and a 5\u2032 phosphate group for functional activity (8). Commercial synthesis of customized siRNA is presently available on a widespread level. Despite the ease of generating chemically synthesized siRNA, a key consideration is choosing the appropriate sequence of the duplex that would most effectively silence the mRNA transcript whose inhibition is desired. It is known that efficacy of silencing varies with segments of the transcripts that are targeted (9). At present no clear\u2010cut rules exist for choosing the best segment to silence, however, it is suggested that the target region should be at a least 70\u2013100 nucleotides away from the translational initiation site of the transcript and that the AU: GC content should be as close to 50% as possible (10). Additionally, the siRNA should target coding sequences, as the process of RNAi occurs only in the cytoplasm. Using these suggestions, as well as empirical testing, a variety of experiments have been performed with chemically presynthesized siRNA.",

            "text": "A problem with using chemically synthesized siRNA is that the most effective target sequence on the transcript is unpredictable. However, simultaneously targeting different segments of the same transcript leads to more effective gene silencing. For example, targeting the HIV entry coreceptor CXCR\u20104 using several siRNA duplexes against different segments of the mRNA transcript resulted in higher silencing activity than using a siRNA against a single target (14). An alternative to simultaneously using several chemically synthesized siRNA duplexes was recently presented, in which siRNA duplexes to every mRNA target site are generated by enzymatically cleaving long dsRNA homologous to the target gene in vitro using RNAse III extracted from Escherichia coli. Generation of long, double\u2010stranded siRNA is typically performed by in vitro transcription of the target gene, both in sense and antisense using the T7 RNA polymerase (15). This promoter possesses the advantage of early termination and has been widely used for in vitro transcription of RNA for almost two decades (16). This \u2018multiple siRNA\u2019 approach has the advantage of using long dsRNA for silencing without inducing the classical nonspecific \u2018panic\u2019 response (17). Although interferon production has been reported by one group using enzymatically generated siRNA (18). Despite this potential drawback, enzymatically generated siRNA was demonstrated to induce specific and potent gene silencing in a recent study where targeting of both exogenous puromycin\u2010resistance gene and endogenous expression of H\u2010ras, c\u2010jun and c\u2010fos was performed (19).

Additionally, sequence selection is difficult owing to variability in targeting efficacy owing to the positional effect described earlier. The ability to enzymatically generate siRNA allows for cheaper production and more effective gene\u2010silencing ability, as the enzymatically generated siRNA can correspond to sequences overlapping the entire gene. Indeed, higher silencing ability using the enzymatically generated siRNA has been reported (20). A drawback of this approach is that spin columns or other methods of purification must be used to separate out the generated siRNA from contaminating uncleaved RNA duplexes, or residual nucleic acids. Despite this, it is the opinion of the authors that enzymatically synthesized siRNA is a more effective and convenient method of inducing gene\u2010silencing than the chemically synthesized forms.",

Such an approach possesses several advantages compared with administration of chemically synthesized siRNA: (1) The siRNA could be constitutively expressed, allowing for a higher level of silencing; (2) regulatory elements could be added to the promoter region of the plasmid such that tissue\u2010specific silencing occurs with a systemically administered plasmid; and (3) permanent gene \u2018knock\u2010down\u2019 cell lines can be established for in vitro work, or for generation of \u2018knock\u2010down\u2019 animals through cloning.",

Basically, SECs consist of a PCR product, which, once transcribed, forms a RNA hairpin loop which is intracellularly cleaved into siRNA. Gene\u2010specific SECs are generated through a series of PCR reactions. The end result is a PCR product that contains a Pol III promoter, a DNA sequence that, once transcribed, forms hairpin siRNA and a terminator sequence (24). As the SEC can be designed with restriction sites, it is possible to clone effective SEC sequences into expression plasmids in order to raise large quantities of SECs.

Subsequent to siRNA\u2010mediated silencing of beta\u2010catenin, in human colon cancer cells, decreased proliferation and diminished invasiveness was observed. Additionally, when these treated cancer cells where placed in a nude mouse, prolonged survival was seen compared with mice receiving unmanipulated tumors (51). Similarly, silencing of the oncogene H\u2010Ras led to inhibition of in vivo tumor growth of human ovarian cancer in a SCID mouse model (52). A class of molecular targets that are very attractive in the field of oncology are the antiapoptotic family of proteins. Small interfering RNA inhibition of bcl\u20102 family members is associated with increased susceptibility of prostate cancer to chemotherapeutic intervention (53). Thus, owing to the overwhelming amount of cancer\u2010specific genes identified on an almost daily basis, the utilization of siRNA for elucidating gene function, and perhaps for therapeutic intervention, becomes increasingly important.",

The original paper by Elshabir et al. demonstrated that administration of chemically synthesized siRNA did not lead to interferon production or nonspecific gene inhibition (11). Indeed, in the author's hands, administration of siRNA did not elicit such effects on dendritic cells (DCs), one of the most sensitive cell types to interferon (54). Despite this, Sledz et al. (55) recently reported that administration of siRNA can induce interferon production through a PKR\u2010dependent mechanism. As siRNA has been administered for a variety of therapeutic usages in vivo (Table 1) and no report of nonspecific interferon induction or toxicity was published, the biological relevance of these findings should be evaluated. Another group reported that certain vectors utilized for delivery of siRNA can lead to a similar induction of interferon responses (56). This is a more plausible scenario, as plasmid DNA may cause formation of long hairpin RNA duplexes that would induce PKR. One possible explanation of the induction of the interferon response could be chemical modifications at the 3\u2032 end of siRNA. Such a scenario was proposed by Kim et al. (18) who demonstrated that \u20103\u2032 triphosphates on the duplex play a critical role in the activation of PKR. In any case, development of siRNA therapeutics will have to ensure that the duplex does not evoke a clinically meaningful interferon response, such a response could hypothetically lead to a wide variety of toxicities in human studies.",

The utilization of siRNA to silence this gene has been successfully accomplished in a murine model of sepsis (36). In addition, the ability of siRNA to modify immunological parameters was recently demonstrated in a study of leukocyte adhesion under flow conditions over TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010activated human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs). Silencing of E\u2010selectin on the activated HUVECs by siRNA was effective as witnessed by lack of mRNA transcripts and inhibition of E\u2010selectin protein. Most importantly, leukocytes flowing over the activated HUVECs did not adhere after siRNA treatment (57). DCs silenced for IL\u201012p35 exhibited higher IL\u201010 production and could modulate immune responses from Th1 to Th2 in an antigen\u2010specific manner both in vitro and in vivo (54). Small interfering RNA\u2010mediated silencing of the NF\u2010kB p50 subunit was used to generate DCs that possessed a reduced expression of IL\u201012 but still maintained maturation ability (58). The feasibility of inhibiting transcription factors in DCs was further illustrated in a study where silencing of the CIITA transcription factor not only inhibited MHC expression but also blocked the production of plexin, a structural protein that endows DCs with dendritic processes (59).",

These findings, combined with the demonstrated pharmacological activity of siRNA, raises the prospect of using siRNA as an immune suppressant. Previous approaches to suppressing T\u2010cell responses included administration of drugs (e.g. cyclosporine), antibodies (e.g. anti\u2010CD154), or fusion proteins (e.g. CTLA4\u2010Ig). Unfortunately, these strategies all possess significant drawbacks such as organotoxicity, lack of specificity, increased thromboembolisms, and poor pharmacokinetics (60, 61, 62). Based on the previous therapeutic utilization of siRNA to accomplish a wide variety of gene silencing therapeutically, we anticipate that silencing of immunological genes in T cells will be a feasible and practical alternative to traditional immune suppressants. Although an earlier study raised concern that inhibitory effects of RNAi may be diluted in proliferating T cells after administration of duplexed siRNA (63), more recent studies using plasmid\u2010driven (64) or lentiviral\u2010delivered (65) siRNA have not suffered this drawback.",

Inhibition of this cellular target would require identification of \u2018master regulator\u2019 genes that control a plethora of downstream biological cascades. Molecular targeting of T cells is limited in that antibodies can only inhibit extracellular proteins, whereas pharmacological inhibitors often possess lack of specificity. Targeting of specific receptor subunits, something difficult to perform with antibodies, can be performed with siRNA. One such target would be the cytokine receptor common gamma chain. Knockout mice whose T cells are deficient in this protein allow for permanent survival of islet allografts (66). Another class of targets that would be particularly attractive in transplantation are transcription factors associated with T\u2010cell inflammatory responses. For example, the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)\u20104 is a DNA\u2010binding protein that is implicated in activation of Th1 inflammatory T\u2010cell responses (67). The relevance of targeting such a protein in contrast to specific cytokines can be seen in experiments where IFN\u2010\u03b3 knockout recipients possess similar or accelerated rates of allograft rejection as wild\u2010type mice (68), whereas STAT\u20104 knockout recipients have a significant decrease in graft pathology and prolonged allograft acceptance (69). The added attractiveness of targeting STAT\u20104 would be the endowment of T cells with an increased predisposition to induction of tolerance, as was elegantly demonstrated by Zhou et al. in STAT\u20104 knockout mice (70). T\u2010bet is another inflammatory\u2010associated transcription factor whose absence results in deficient Th1 development (71). Silencing of this gene may yield results comparable to STAT\u20104 inhibition in transplantation.",

Previous reports using AO have demonstrated that inhibition of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on DCs prolongs allograft survival (72). Additionally, administration of CD40\u2212 DCs induces antigen\u2010specific tolerance through the generation of Treg cells (73). Therefore targeting such costimulatory molecules on APCs using siRNA appears to be potentially fruitful approach. As stated previously, the transcription factor NF\u2010\u03baB possesses potent immune stimulatory activity through its ability to activate several signalling pathways in APCs leading to robust T\u2010cell stimulation. Feasibility of silencing NF\u2010\u03baB subunits was already demonstrated to result in generation of Th2\u2010promoting DCs (58). Owing to the potent tolerogenic activity of other NF\u2010\u03baB inhibitors, we anticipate siRNA silencing of this target would be a useful approach to inducing APC\u2010mediated tolerance. Cytokines elaborated by APCs involved in induction of na\u00efve T\u2010cell differentiation would also be a promising target. We have previously demonstrated that silencing of IL\u201012 p35 in DCs induces Th2 deviation in vitro and in vivo (54).

Although viral vectors are promising in preclinical models, the fatality reported in a clinical trial of gene therapy using such a vector has placed a significant roadblock in the implementation of viral approaches (76). Murine studies have indicated that siRNA can be administered through the \u2018hydrodynamic approach\u2019; however, such a strategy would clearly not be ethical clinically (37, 77). One attractive method is through delivery of siRNA using cell\u2010specific immunoliposomes. Immunoliposomes are artificial model membranes with specific antibodies attached to the outer lipid leaflet thus enabling specific discharge of liposomal contents into cells expressing the surface antigen recognized by the respective antibody. The attractiveness of this approach is that unique cellular specificity can be achieved. The utility of liposomal techniques has been demonstrated clinically in studies where liposomal drugs allow for much lower administration of the said drug without losing the desired therapeutic effect (78, 79). This approach has been successfully used to target chemotherapeutic agents against tumors using antibodies to the oncogenic protein HER\u20102 (80). The ability of immunoliposomes to deliver nucleic acids to specific target cells was recently demonstrated (81). Additionally, in vivo delivery of siRNA has been previously reported using liposomes (82). A type of liposome currently used for cell\u2010specific targeting is the polyethelene glycol (PEG)\u2010immunoliposome, in which nucleic acids are entrapped in the fluid phase of the liposome and the antibodies are coupled to PEG and are anchored in the lipid bilayer (83). Such immunoliposomes have been demonstrated to be innocuous in a variety of in vivo toxicological models (84). Specifically, for transplantation, one could use immunoliposomes to specifically target siRNA to Th cells via CD4 (85); to APCs such as DCs using CD11c (86) or macrophages using STEALTH liposomes (87).",

Donor organs are subjected to flushing and storage in hypothermic conditions (4 \u00b0C) in specially formulated solutions (organ storage solutions) in order to wash out debris and to decrease damage during transportation (88). A variety of groups have performed modifications to typical perfusion solutions to attain better graft function (89, 90, 91, 92). Despite these modifications, little work has been performed on altering organ and tissue immunogenicity, which is directly related to graft rejection. Chen et al. (93) transfected kidneys with naked antisense DNA in order to suppress expression of intracellular adhesion molecule\u20101 (ICAM\u20101). Successful prevention of reperfusion injury was noted. Similarly, suppression of NF\u2010\u03baB activation was reported in rat hearts by administration of decoy oligonucleotides to the organ in the perfusion solution (94). Previous attempts to modify direct antigen presentation by donor DCs using monoclonal antibodies have failed owing to the inability of the perfusion process to deliver the antibodies to a sufficient number of target cells (95). Addition of siRNA\u2010targeting genes associated with immune rejection, endothelial activation, and apoptosis to the organ storage solution is a potentially useful avenue of ex vivo administration of siRNA. In support of this approach are studies demonstrating efficient gene\u2010silencing through siRNA administration into whole kidney cultures (96). The observation that intranasal delivery of siRNA leads to pulmonary gene silencing (28) also strengthens the notion that siRNA can be used for localized gene silencing in isolated organs.",
