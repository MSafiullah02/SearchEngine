Therefore, chemotherapy has played a more important role in treatment and prevention of gliomas. However, so far very few drugs have been approved for treating gliomas including temozolomide (TMZ), carmustine, and lomustine. Of these, only TMZ has been independently used for treatment of gliomas. Furthermore, most current anti-glioma drugs are cytotoxicity-based alkylating agents with limited efficacy and serious side-effects (Chamberlain, 2010, Mittal et al., 2015). Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover lead compounds for development of novel anti-glioma drugs. Marine-derived natural products are important sources for discovery of new anticancer drug leads (Newman and Cragg, 2014, Petit and Biard, 2013, Schumacher et al., 2011).",

There are several important regulators (enzymes) in the glycolytic pathway, such as hexokinase 2 (HK2) (Vander Heiden, 2011, Wolf et al., 2011), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3) (Kessler et al., 2008, Vander Heiden, 2011), and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) (Kefas et al., 2010, Vander Heiden, 2011), that have been shown to be up-regulated in the glioma cells. These specific regulators are preferentially used by cancer cells (Vander Heiden, 2011). Glutamine metabolism (Daye and Wellen, 2012, Ru et al., 2013) and lipid metabolism (Guo et al., 2013, Ru et al., 2013, Santos and Schulze, 2012) have also been found to be largely altered in cancer cells. Both glutaminase (GLS, a key enzyme of glutaminolysis) (Daye and Wellen, 2012, Lu et al., 2010, Ru et al., 2013) and fatty acid synthase (FASN, a key lipogenic enzyme) (Menendez and Lupu, 2007, Ru et al., 2013) are up-regulated in gliomas. Accumulated studies have demonstrated that the above mentioned metabolic enzymes are promising targets for discovery of novel anticancer drugs.",

Culture of this marine actinomycete was grown in Gause's liquid medium (50.0 L). The extract prepared from the culture of P11-23B showed significant activity against the proliferation of human glioma cells with inhibitions of 87.17% for glioma U87-MG cells and 86.84% for U251 cells. Separation of this active extract by ODS column chromatography, following by HPLC purification, afforded three compounds 1\u20133.",

            "text": "Compound 1 was proved to be the known cyclodepsipeptide valinomycin based on its NMR and HRESIMS data, melting point, optical rotation value, the analysis of its acidic hydrolysates by chiral HPLC and GC analyses, and the comparison with literature data (Pettit et al., 1999, Tabeta and Saito, 1985). Valinomycin (1) was previously isolated from several Streptomyces species (Heisey et al., 1988, Lim et al., 2007, Park et al., 2008, Pettit et al., 1999) and is well known to enhance the K+ permeability of several membrane systems including mitochondria, erythrocytes, and lipid bilayers (Bhattacharyya et al., 1971, Haynes et al., 1969). This cyclodepsipeptide was also reported to have activities against tumors, bacteria, fungi (Lim et al., 2007, Park et al., 2008, Pettit et al., 1999), and severe acute respiratory-syndrome coronavirus (Wu et al., 2004). Valinomycin (1) is composed of four units of D-valine (D-Val), L-valine (L-Val), D-\u03b1-hydroxyisovaleric acid (D-Hiv), and L-lactate (L-Lac) with a trimer structure of cyclo-(D-Val-L-Lac-L-Val-D-Hiv)3. For its 13C and 1H NMR spectroscopic data assignments, see Table S2 (Supplementary Data). It was noted that each of the four units displayed characteristic NMR signals, which allowed for differentiation of the four units. The unit L-Lac was easily recognized by its NMR signals of \u03b4\nC 172.7 (C-1), 70.4 (C-2), 17.3 (C-3) and \u03b4\nH 5.32 (1H, q, J = 7.0 Hz, H-2) and 1.44 (3H, d, J = 7.0 Hz, H-3), while D-Hiv had its characteristic signals of \u03b4\nC 171.0 (C-1), 78.7 (C-2), 30.4 (C-3), 16.8 (C-4) and \u03b4\nH 5.02 (1H, d, J = 3.11 Hz, H-2). The D-Val and L-Val could be distinguished from their chemical shifts of C-1, C-2, H-2 and the coupling constant values of 3\nJ\nCH-NH. The unit D-Val was indicated by its characteristic NMR signals at \u03b4\nC 170.2 (C-1), 59.1 (C-2) and \u03b4\nH 4.10 (1H, dd, J = 10.0, 8.1 Hz, H-2), 7.88 (1H, d, J = 8.1 Hz, NH-2), as compared with their counterparts of L-Val at \u03b4\nC 172.0 (C-1), 60.6 (C-2) and \u03b4\nH 3.96 (1H, dd, J = 10.2, 6.2 Hz, H-2), 7.80 (1H, d, J = 6.2 Hz, NH-2). All of these characteristic NMR signals mentioned above are very helpful for the structure elucidation of the new compounds of streptodepsipeptides P11A (2) and P11B (3), which had very complicated NMR signals.",

            "text": "The HRESIMS spectrum of compound 2 displayed ions at m/z 1095.6051 ([M\u2212H]\u2212) and 1097.6227 ([M+H]+), corresponding to the molecular formula of C53H88N6O18. Its 13C NMR spectrum showed 53 carbon resonances, which were distributed in six zones. The first zone displayed 12 carbonyl carbon (C\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nO) signals at \u03b4\nC 170.28\u2013172.80. Six carbon signals at \u03b4\nC 70.41\u201378.93 in the second zone were assigned to six oxymethines (\u03b1\u2014CH\u2014O) and six resonances at \u03b4\nC 58.98\u201360.75 in the third zone were contributed to six nitrogenated methines (\u03b1\u2014CH\u2014N). The fourth zone exhibited eight methines (\u03b2-CH) at \u03b4\nC 28.49\u201330.41 and one carbon signal at \u03b4\nC 25.16 in the fifth zone was assigned to a methylene (\u03b2-CH2). The remaining 20 carbons, which appeared at \u03b4\nC 9.41\u201319.92 in the sixth zone, were assigned to 20 methyls (\u03b3-CH3 or \u03b2-CH3). The 1H NMR spectrum of 2 also showed six NH signals at \u03b4\nH 7.89 (d, 7.9 Hz), 7.84 (d, 6.0 Hz), 7.83 (d, 8.0 Hz), 7.83 (d, 8.0 Hz), 7.77 (d, 6.2 Hz), and 7.76 (d, 5.8 Hz). All of the above data suggested that compound 2 was composed of 12 units, including six amide groups (amino acids) and six ester groups. Acid hydrolysis of 2 produced D-Val, L-Val, D-Hiv, L-Lac, D-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (D-Hba) as determined by chiral HPLC and GC analyses using the standard compounds as references. Detailed COSY, HSQC, and HMBC spectroscopic analyses confirmed the presence of 12 units including three L-lactates, three L-valines, three D-valines, two D-\u03b1-hydroxyisovaleric acids, and one D-2-hydroxybutanoic acid (D-Hba). As shown in Fig. 2\n, the \u03b1-NH and \u03b1-CH protons of each valine had a COSY correlation, while the \u03b1-CH proton of each unit displayed a COSY correlation with the \u03b2-CH (or \u03b2-CH2 for D-Hba, or \u03b2-CH3 for L-Lac) proton, which was correlated with the \u03b3-CH3 proton. HMBC correlations (see Table 1\nand Fig. 2) further supported the structure of each unit. According to the foregoing NMR correlations and the NMR data comparison of compounds 2 and 1, it was concluded that the D-Hba unit had its characteristic NMR signals at \u03b4\nC 171.40 (C-1), 75.56 (C-2), 25.16 (C-3), 9.41 (C-4) and \u03b4\nC 5.11 (1H, dd, J = 6.6, 4.3 Hz, H-2), three L-Lac units resonated at \u03b4\nC 172.80, 172.65, 172.55 (C-1), 70.61, 70.53, 70.41 (C-2), 17.44, 17.37, 17.23 (C-3) and \u03b4\nH 5.33, 5.33, 5.27 (each 1H, q, J = 6.8 Hz, H-2), and two D-Hiv units displayed at \u03b4\nC 171.16, 170.86 (C-1), 78.93, 78.69 (C-2), 30.41, 30.41 (C-3), 16.84, 16.80 (C-4) and \u03b4\nH 4.99, 5.02 (each 1H, d, J = 3.2 Hz, H-2). Similarly, the C-1 and C-2 of L-Val and D-Val exhibited different 13C chemical shifts, which were observed at \u03b4\nC 171.50\u2013172.22 (>\u03b4 171.0, C-1) and \u03b4\nC 60.11\u201360.75 (>\u03b4 60.0, C-2) for L-Val, and \u03b4\nC 170.28\u2013170.42 (<171.0, C-1) and \u03b4\nC 58.98\u201359.25 (<60.0, C-2) for D-Val. The coupling constant values of 3\nJ\nCH-NH for the two valines were also different with 5.8\u20136.2 Hz for L-Val and 7.9\u20138.0 Hz for D-Val.",

Its 13C NMR spectrum showed 52 carbon signals for 12 carbonyls (\u03b4\nC 170.20\u2013172.98), six oxymethines (\u03b4\nC 70.33\u201379.21), six nitrogenated methines (\u03b4\nC 58.75\u201360.97), eight methines (\u03b4\nC 28.46\u201330.43), and 20 methyls (\u03b4\nC 16.78\u201320.03). Acid hydrolysates of 3 were found to be D-Val, L-Val, D-Hiv, and L-Lac as determined by chiral HPLC and GC. Further detailed NMR spectroscopic analysis, in combination with the HRESIMS data, indicated that the structure of 3 was very similar to that of 2, except for another L-Lac moiety in 3 instead of the D-Hba moiety in 2. The 13C and 1H NMR data (Table 2\n) of 3 were assigned based on the HSQC and HMBC correlations and by comparison of its NMR data with those of compounds 2 and 1. The structure of 3 was thus elucidated as cyclo-(D-Val-L-Lac-L-Val-D- Hiv-D-Val-L-Lac-L-Val-D-Hiv-D-Val-L-Lac-L-Val-L-Lac), named as streptodepsipeptide P11B, a new cyclodepsipeptide.",

Firstly, the expression levels of HK2, PFKFB3, PKM2, GLS, and FASN in four different glioma cell lines of SHG-44, U87-MG, U251, and C6 were tested by western blot. It has been found that all five tumor metabolic regulators were highly expressed in the U87-MG cells (Fig. 6\nA). Thus, the effects of streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) on expression levels of these regulators in the U87-MG cells were evaluated. U87-MG cells were treated by streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) (5 \u03bcM or 10 \u03bcM) for 48 h. Protein prepared from the streptodepsipeptide P11A-treated U87-MG cells was subjected to western blot analysis. The results (Fig. 6B) indicated that HK2, PFKFB3, GLS, and FASN were highly down-regulated in the streptodepsipeptide P11A-treated U87-MG cells, when compared to negative control (CON, U87-MG cells without streptodepsipeptide P11A treatment), while PKM2 was slightly down-regulated. Similar results were also obtained for the known valinomycin (1). As shown in Fig. S83, valinomycin (1) remarkably reduced expression levels of HK2, FANS, GLS, and had little effect on the downregulation of PKM2. In order to determine if streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) selectively affected the expressions of these tumor metabolic enzymes, its effects on regulation of aconitase 2 (ACO2), ATP synthase beta (ATPB), and cytochrome C (Cyto-C) were also investigated [ACO2, ATPB, and Cyto-C are important regulators in the processes of tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, which are the predominant metabolic processes of glucose in the normal cells (Galluzzi et al., 2013, Jones and Schulze, 2012)]. As presented in Fig. 6C, streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) had no obvious effects on ACO2 and ATPB expression levels, but increased the level of Cyto-C. These data suggested that streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) might selectively regulate tumor metabolic regulators of HK2, PFKFB3, PKM2, GLS, and FASN. The increased expression level of Cyto-C also implied that streptodepsipeptide P11A (2) might change the tumor metabolic pathway to the process of oxidative phosphorylation.",

The combination (about 13 mL) of supernatant and cytoplasm was digested by using a mixture (3 mL) of 15.99 mol/L HNO3 and 11.65 mol/L HClO4 (2:1, v/v) at 140\u2013160 \u00b0C for 30 min until a clear and transparent liquid (about 1 mL) appeared. The digested solution was transferred into a volumetric flask (10 mL) and then diluted with 0.1 M HNO3 to the full volume. The 10 mL digested solution was further diluted with 0.1 M HNO3 by 50 times to make a final digested solution for the measurement of intracellular K+ concentration by AA800 atomic absorption spectrometry. A series of accurate K+ solutions were prepared with KCl to investigate calibration curve (R\n2 = 0.998). The K+ concentration of each sample was calculated from the calibration curve.",
