The world has warmed up by approximately 0.85 \u00b0C. In particular, the last decade has been the warmest since 1850 [1], and the frequency and intensity of natural disasters (such as earthquakes, devastating storms, forest fires, prolonged heat waves, droughts, and floods) have increased manifold. Between 1998 and 2017, climate-related and geophysical disasters killed 1.3 million people and left a further 4.4 billion injured, homeless, displaced, or in need of emergency assistance [2]. Climate change scenarios include a change in the spread of infectious diseases with warming and changes in outbreaks associated with extreme weather events after floods or as a result of water heating. Furthermore, warmer climates provide more favourable conditions for the survival and completion of the life cycle of the vector that transmits pathogens [3]. Natural disasters and extreme events lead to traumatic deaths and injuries, mental illnesses, and infections, while global warming per se promotes heat-associated illnesses (cardiovascular strain, pulmonary diseases, exsiccosis, mental disorder [4]).",

In patients with serious lung diseases like asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), an aggravation of severity or increased mortality has been described as a consequence of global warming. Increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, air pollution, forest fires, prolonged heat waves, droughts, and floods contributes to increased respiratory morbidity and mortality. During the 2006 heat wave in Portugal, for each 1 \u00b0C increase COPD morbidity increased by 5.4%, especially in women and in persons aged over 75 years [10]. Furthermore, a rapid spread of viral respiratory infections (e.g. Hantavirus, respiratory syncytial virus) as well as fungal respiratory infections (coccidioidomycosis, aspergillosis) can be expected [11].",

A recent study [13] has recognized an epidemic of chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology in Central America (\u2018Mesoamerican Nephropathy\u2019), which has been attributed to recurrent dehydration due to heat stress. Several studies have addressed potential cardiopulmonary health effects associated with climate change parameters [overview in 14], and these effects are expected to further increase in the coming decades. It seems that a rise in mortality, emergency room visits, and (intensive care) hospitalization due to cardiopulmonary diseases attendant on heat stress, extreme weather conditions, or air pollution are more certain than worst-case horror scenarios.",

In a recent survey on climate change and health on the members of the American Thoracic Society [15], the majority of the respondents stated that climate change is a fact that it is relevant for patient care. They confirm that physicians and physician organizations should play an active role in educating patients, the public, and policy-makers about the effects of climate change on human health. Do we play such an active role yet? Are we prepared to confront the increased frequency of critical illnesses about which, in some cases, we have to learn first? [16] To our knowledge, there is presently no specific activity in intensive care medicine to face current and future challenges in the context of global warming and climate change, although it is expected that intensive care medicine will need more specialized capacities, better knowledge on the part of the intensivists, and better preparation for worst-case scenarios (heat stroke waves or infectious outbreaks) to manage the consequences of climate change adequately.",

ICU bed capacities represent by far not the only challenge; changes in knowledge and organization are required to be prepared (Table 1). The intensive care staff will in the near future need specific knowledge about \u2018uncommon\u2019 diseases and heat stroke management (especially in the elderly), and the ICU must be organized so as to be able to effectively take care of larger numbers of rapidly incoming critically ill patients in the context of natural disasters. Especially in megacities and coastal regions, the number of ICU beds should be checked so that they are sufficient in times of natural disasters. A functionally adequate capacity for isolating patients with critical infections is indispensable for successful infection control management. Expert support from psychiatrists or psychologists must be available in situations of devastating floods, storms, or heat waves. Preparing intensive care medicine for the consequences of climate change does not mean neglecting the basic principle of medicine\u2014the best cure is prevention. Therefore, supporting efforts that reduce or ideally stop global warming are the need of the hour.",
