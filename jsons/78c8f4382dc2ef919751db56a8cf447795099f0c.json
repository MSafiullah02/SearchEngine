However, allowing this information to be operationalised as a syndromic surveillance system was highly contentious with three juries voting in favour, and one against by narrow margins. For those in favour, support depended on several conditions related to system oversight and security being met. Those against were concerned about loss of privacy and did not trust Australian governments to run secure and effective systems. Conclusions: Participants across all four events strongly supported the introduction of data linkage and pathogenomics to public health research under current research governance structures. Combining pathogen WGS with event-based data surveillance systems, however, is likely to be controversial because of a lack of public trust, even when the potential public health benefits are clear. Any suggestion of private sector involvement or commercialisation of WGS or surveillance data was unanimously rejected.",

In Australia (and internationally) communicable disease risks are monitored through three core public health activities: (i) outbreak investigations; (ii) disease surveillance; and, (iii) public health research [5] . They all rely on systematic data collection to direct health resources and initiate public health actions in response to communicable disease risks and outbreaks. Two new technologies -pathogen whole genome sequencing (WGS; pathogenomics) and 'Big Data' analytics -could greatly enhance communicable disease control [6] . WGS is the ultimate microbiological strain-typing method. Effective communicable disease prevention and control depends on the accurate identification and characterisation of the causal pathogen -including the strain involved [7] [8] [9] . Increasingly sophisticated strain-typing methods have been developed over the past 20 years but, until recently, they have been expensive, time-consuming and/or poorly discriminatory. WGS systems that are faster, cheaper and more informative are being introduced into public health laboratories [10] [11] [12] [13] . Their integration into infectious disease diagnosis and management will dramatically improve the accuracy and speed of pathogen identification and biological risk prediction. WGS produce universally understood data expressed in the sequence of nucleotides which can be used to reconstruct transmission pathways, highlight missing cases, and, potentially, locate an individual at the time of exposure [14] [15] [16] . Pathogen WGS is already being used in public health surveillance systems in Australia [17] and elsewhere [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Because infectious disease risks are universal, there are global calls for equitable sharing of WGS-based surveillance data to help distribute the benefits [23] . The increasing availability of pathogen sequence data will provide new resources for communicable disease research, control and surveillance at local, national and global scales [24, 25] .",

This is justified by the need to operationalise public health protection, but tempered by a requirement that data are used only for public health purposes and personal information is protected [34, 35] . The benefits of earlier outbreak detection and response are significant. More expedient and specific interventions can limit the health and socioeconomic impacts of infectious diseases, but surveillance has political, personal and ethical implications [36, 37] . Risks include the use of flawed methods (as illustrated by Google Flu Trends\u00ae, which proved to have poor reliability) [38] [39] [40] . A trade-off may be required between data accuracy and privacy. Outbreak prediction or modelling based on inadequate data can have devastating economic, health and social consequences, but collecting, holding and sharing personal health information is a threat to privacy, no matter how great the potential benefits [41] . For example, WGS pathogen \"fingerprinting\" linked to clinical, epidemiological and spatiotemporal data will reveal information normally regarded as private (e.g. where a person has been, who they were with and the type of activity involved) [42] [43] [44] . Digital epidemiologypopulation disease detection and monitoring using 'Big Data'raises similar issues [45] . Currently in public health research, data are de-identified and so might be assumed to be anonymous. However, in the absence of strict security measures, reidentification may be possible; re-identification usually can be achieved using linked metadata and other data sources, and hacking remains an ever-present risk [46] [47] [48] .",

To secure social licence, these systems must align with community values; this can be facilitated by structured public dialogue to develop ethically and legally defensible justification for their design and operation [6, 49] . In this paper, we report on four community juries convened to consider the acceptability and legitimacy of using new technologies to enhance public health research and communicable disease surveillance. Research suggests that while the public tacitly accepts public health surveillance, they are less consistently convinced of the benefits of the secondary use of data for medical research [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] . Our aim was to ascertain, by means of community juries, the conditions under which a well-informed citizenry would or would not accept integration of pathogen WGS and Big Data analytics into communicable disease control, and why.",

To track changes in positions held by individual jurors, participants completed an anonymous ballot three times -after considering evidence at the end of day one; after overnight reflection at the beginning of day two; and after their deliberation and delivery of the verdict at the end of day two. Jurors also completed an exit survey for the purposes of process evaluation, at the conclusion of each jury. During the final session a researcher recorded the verdict and reasons on a flipchart. Each point was reviewed by the jury to ensure accuracy. Transcripts were subsequently reviewed to identify and clarify key reasons why jurors supported or rejected the presented options. Results summarise jurors' descriptions of the rationale and reasoning underpinning their responses. Table 3 lists the outcomes of the final votes taken at all four juries. All of the juries supported the linkage of pathogen WGS data with administrative datasets for public health and microbiological research (Option B). The first three juries also supported application of Big Data analytics to linked pathogenomic and administrative datasets to enhance communicable disease surveillance (Option C) noting that in Jury#3 this was only by a slim majority. The final jury held in eastern Sydney (Jury #4) voted against adding research and surveillance to the status quo (Option C)once again by a slim majority. Table 4 show the balance of the vote changed during the course of each jury with votes shifting between options A, B and C after provision of the evidence, overnight and after deliberation. Support for adding research and surveillance to the status quo (Option C) increased after participants had deliberated, but not enough in Jury #4 for this to become the majority position. Notably, all jurors supported current systems (Option A), such that there were no concerns or conditions stipulated about the use of pathogen WGS, administrative or publicly available social media data, during outbreak investigations and response. However, the support of jurors for using these technologies to enhance research (Option B) and research and surveillance (Option C) was contingent on several conditions being met. In what follows we describe the reasons jurors gave for supporting or rejecting a particular position, including any qualifying conditions. We then elaborate on the key points of consensus and disagreement between the juries. Support for option B (adding research to the status quo)",

Having considered this requirement, each community jury independently came to the position that an 'opt-out' consent model was an appropriate compromise because it allowed individuals to withdraw, while leaving large enough datasets, by default, to maximise public health and research benefits. Various mechanisms for opting-out were discussed such as including a box on pathology request forms for patients to withhold consent for data-linkage and sharing, or establishing and raising public awareness about an online registry for people to indicate that they chose to opt-out of the system. None of the juries came to a definitive position as to how an optout system should be implemented, but all agreed that this consent model was most appropriate.

Public health laboratories, data custodians and linkage agents that support research, must be publicly funded to adequately maintain their integrity and sustainability and obviate a need for commercial support.

In general, jurors wanted only summary data to be shared internationally. Any linked data must be deidentified, protected by practices used for other government-operated administrative datasets, in Australia, and not publicly accessible, to reduce the risk of re-identification and protect privacy. Because WGSrelated information could lead to adverse social, legal and actuarial consequences for individuals, jurors foresaw a need for legislation to reassure and protect the public from its misuse, including heavy penalties to deter hacking or leaking of data or unauthorised use by commercial (e.g. insurance or news media) organisations.

This information and any changes must be publicly available in plain language. Because such a system could potentially be misused for political aims, all jurors thought the operating body and related data-linkage agencies, would need to be protected by robust supporting legislation to protect its regulatory independence. These supporting structures were regarded as important to make changing the purpose or practices of surveillance difficult and remove the role and remit of the operating organisation from politics.

For some participants, while the potential benefits of technologically enhancing communicable disease surveillance were understood, it was not obvious that the current system needed to be enhanced. Notably, the process of deliberation increased support for using these technologies to enhance communicable disease surveillance, because participants were able to articulate their concerns and think through different conditions that would need to be met for them to accept its implementation. However, as the weaker levels of support for Option C in the final two juries shows, the more people understand the risks, the less likely they are to support surveillance. Our results suggest that people intuitively react against being subjected to surveillance and, when they have more information, they become more hostile to implementation. But, if they talk with peers who are strong advocates of the benefits of surveillance, they are willing to soften their stance. Accordingly, most of the conditions imposed by jurors were designed to increase data protection and reduce the risk of data and privacy breaches, including limiting linkage to data held within health systems, and imposing strong governance conditions.",

Most jurors at these UK events also wanted individuals to have the right to 'opt out' of data sharing arrangements and became less sceptical about health data sharing for public health research, as they became better informed of its benefits and risks [61] . They also wanted data to only be provided to organizations that could demonstrate that the primary goal for using the data was public benefit (either for new treatments or to improve existing services). For data-sharing at least our results are similar, as establishing an 'opt-out' system was preferred by most jurors in the current study for reasons of effectiveness, diversity and inclusion. Noting the citizens' jury in the UK did not discuss the use of data-linkage in infectious disease surveillance, participants at our events became more sceptical about employing these technologies as more contextual information was added about the conditions of implementation. Evidence of potential harms was made less explicit for first 2 juries, and support for option C waned substantially once this evidence was formally introduced. Our findings highlight that people do not assess security enhancing technologies -such as surveillance -in abstract terms but in relation to the specific institutional and social context of implementation [68] . As shown by previous deliberative research [61, 69] , people accept some loss of privacy for public benefits in specific circumstances.",

Surveillance of various kinds is arguably becoming the norm, driven by both governments and corporations. In both democratic and non-democratic countries Closed Circuit TV (CCTV) is increasingly having facial recognition functions added [70] ; internet usage is, as a Forbes journalist recently wrote, \"designed to be a surveillance machine\" rather than being \"private by design\" [71] . This is NOT occurring in line with the strict governance requirements that these juries recommended. The fact that people were more likely to reject surveillance when they understood more about it suggests that the existing forms of surveillance, were they to be more transparent, may also be rejected unless there was an extremely convincing public benefit-argument and effective independent oversight. The governance of public health systems tends to be more open than average and this project is an example of such a governance system being willing to engage with the public about the challenges it faces. There is an irony here. By seeking public input into surveillance system design, we could end up with tighter controls on a surveillance system that might be more likely to offer public benefit than many of the commercially oriented surveillance systems already in place. But, precisely because public health is about the common good and relies on trusting relationships between publics and governance systems, arguably public health authorities should uphold the highest possible standards to preserve trust. This process could however also be seen as a wakeup call for all the other state and non-state actors engaging in nontransparent surveillance.",

Participants in the current study were initially resistant to allowing greater data-linkage in research but changed their position during the course of the event. But rather than simply trusting that the appropriate systems would be put in place, during their deliberations support among jurors very much depended on efforts to establish and sustain the trustworthiness of the system [64] . These included assurances and clarity about where the data goes and who would have access, the transparency of the operating and data-linking organisation, and the imposition of independent oversight and appropriate checks and balances. Any suggestion of private sector involvement or commercialisation of any of these systems was unanimously rejected across all four of the study settings.

However, this underlying willingness does not necessarily translate into high levels of support for their implementation. The view that publics need to be educated so that they trust science and its governance is shifting. It is increasingly recognised that in order to establish the trustworthiness of new institutions, publics need to be actively involved in key policy decisions about the nature, content and scope of their activities [37, 64] . In their study of the governance of biobanks in Canada, O'Doherty and colleagues [75] identified several necessary conditions and institutional arrangements and qualities that work to establish trustworthy models of governance for new institutions. It is notable that, in their deliberations seeking to address the question asked of them, all four of these juries derived similar necessary conditions for the establishment of a new, potentially highly intrusive surveillance system. Table 5 is an adaptation of the criteria they developed that is applicable to other forms data-collection, aggregation and storage. Because O'Doherty and colleagues [75] established these principles in one context, and they were produced more or less de-novo by our deliberative groups in a different context, it is arguable that they capture something at the core of what citizens hold to be important. Incorporating highly structured processes for public deliberation and exchange, between mini-publics, practitioners and policy-makers, can support the development of knowledge that is essential to establishing [64, 76] :",

The sample size is small, but this is necessary for high-quality deliberation. A possible limitation is that the evidence presented changed between Jury#1 and Jury#3 in response to participant feedback asking for more detailed evidence on the potential risks of technologically enhancing communicable disease surveillance systems. Because all four deliberative groups articulated similar positions and conditions for accepting system implementation, the new evidence changed the balance of the vote in the final verdict, and not the sets of reasons participants had for accepting or rejecting system implementation.
