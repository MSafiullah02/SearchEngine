Two additional patients had encephalopathy related to ADEM, which may be associated with prior viral infection. In patients with CNS Aspergillosis, MRIs showed an area of infarction in one patient and leukoencephalopathy in another. The CSF was normal in one patient and revealed an increased number of red blood cells in the other patient. Both patients required brain biopsy for diagnosis. In three patients with presumed viral causes, two had leukoencephalopathy on MRI and one had multiple focal T2W hyperintensities. CSF was tested in two; one was normal and one showed increased total protein only. Brain biopsy was carried out in one patient and revealed perivascular cuffing, a finding most consistent with a viral process. In the two patients with ADEM, MRI showed leukoencephalopathy in one patient and focal hyperintensity of the temporal lobe in another patient. The CSF revealed elevated WBC with a lymphocytic predominance and elevated total protein in one patient and elevated RBC and total protein in another patient. Both had brain biopsy performed, which revealed perivascular inflammation in one and inclusion bodies consisting of myelin debris in another. These findings suggest that CSF differentials may not be a reliable means of assessing infection in immunocompromised HSCT patients. Further diagnostic considerations in such patients include PCR-based testing of the CSF for infectious pathogens and/or brain biopsy. Indeed, molecular testing for a number of viral pathogens is a relatively recent development; therefore, this crucial data is missing for most patients treated during the study period. Some of the patients with idiopathic encephalopathy may have suffered from undiagnosed viral disease. In patients with encephalopathy, CSF samples are now assayed for these pathogens as well as HSV, VZV, BK virus, and JC virus. The list of candidate pathogens for testing will continue to increase as PCR becomes available for additional agents. Six patients had brain biopsies performed with no complications, yielding a diagnosis in five.

The association between encephalopathy and pituitary changes, endocrine abnormalities, or malignant changes remains unclear, because all three patients died before more extensive endocrine or histologic evaluation could be undertaken. This is an interesting finding as this is the point in development (postadolescence) at which pituitary size is maximal. The clinical symptoms in patients are consistent with pituitary apoplexy with headache and mental status changes. Interestingly, these are common presenting symptoms for pituitary apoplexy.17,18 Our three patients did not report visual field deficits but were all encephalopathic at the time these symptoms may have developed. All patients were severely thrombocytopenic (platelet range 5000\u201323 000/mm3) around the time a CNS event could have occurred. It is intriguing that one patient likely developed this in association with severe sepsis with hypotension and uremia. This clinical scenario is similar to that seen with Sheehan's syndrome with an abrupt decrease in perfusion. One patient carried a diagnosis of TTP. One patient has been reported with pituitary apoplexy and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).19 Although the mechanism of thrombocytopenia is different with TTP and ITP, the result is severe thrombocytopenia which may predispose a patient to pituitary hemorrhage. A third patient had this MRI finding in association with drug-related Parkinsonism. In the future, the presence of this feature on the MRI of a patient who has received HSCT will indicate the need for additional diagnostic considerations, including endocrinologic evaluation. We recommend that MRIs be performed on all patients showing signs of encephalopathy. Focal lesions on MR images may lead the clinician to the appropriate diagnostic test or change in medication in many cases. Indeed, focal MRI findings led to a brain biopsy in six patients included in this study.",

Standardized testing including MRI, EEG, and molecular studies for infectious pathogens are mandatory. The role of PET/SPECT scans requires evaluation. Brain biopsy may be required if the above measures are inconclusive or if focal lesions are seen on the MRI. Refinements will be made as data become available from prospective studies that include a full array of modern diagnostic tests. It is worth noting that nearly all of the causes of encephalopathy that we identified are treatable if diagnosed early.
