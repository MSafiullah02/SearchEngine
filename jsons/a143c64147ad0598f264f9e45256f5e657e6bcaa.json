Small chips of rock were also taken for identification of smaller algae. To avoid disturbance to the vegetation of the stations, collecting was carried out over a wide but prescribed area, which was chosen according to the size and characteristics of each station. It is considered that sampling by this technique had a negligible effect on the flora, especially in comparison with the effects of storms and seasonal changes. The algae were identified in the laboratory by one of us (V.M.). The study area was first investigated in June 1973 and on several subsequent occasions, but collecting along the transect did not begin until September 1974. Collections were made on 24 separate occasions from 1974 to 1979 (see Table  4a ). The collection of April 1975 was lost and only a photographic record of forty coloured slides remained so that the list of species compiled from the photographs for that date is likely to be incomplete, particularly for smaller species. However both this (with twenty species) and the next collection in July, in which twentynine species were recorded, followed closely upon storms which denuded many rock surfaces in the transect area of their algae. For comparison with other collections see Table 4a .",

Those species showing greatest numerical differences in frequency of occurrence between the two years are listed in Table 7 , Groups 1 and 2. Group 3 lists some less common (but not rare species as listed in Table 6 ) algae, six of which disappeared in 1975 or 1976 and did not reappear, and one species which was seen for the first time in 1978.",

Another means of comparing the flora in 1975 and 1978 is to calculate similarity coefficients on the basis of species presence or absence (Hruby 1976) . For this comparison the eight observations of each of these years were pooled and the total number of species occurring in them used to calculate the S(^rensen similarity coefficient (Table 8 -complete similarity is attained with a coefficient of unity). Each station showed some change, with a coefficient between 0.69 and 0.83 for the total number of species. Station E showed a very low coefficient (0.40) for the green algae; that is, a very significant difference between 1975 and 1978. However, the number of green algae involved (ten species) was small, so that large random changes might be expected. Shepherd & Womersley (1970 , 1971 , 1976 have published the only previous work for Australia, on subtidal communities in South Australia. They suggest that three subtidal zones exist: (1) an upper sublittoral zone, the depth of which is dependent on wave action, in which only turf algae occur, (2) a mid-sublittoral zone dominated by Ecklonia radiata and other large brown algae, and (3) a lower sublittoral zone at depths greater than 40 m where light is severely limiting.",

Station B taken at a depth beginning at 1 m, had only small plants of the larger species of brown algae together with a complete covering of turf algae and may well have been representative of this merged zone 1 and 2.

A number of herbivores was present, such as sea urchins (Heliocidaris erythogramme and Centrotus rodgasii), limpets and the large turban-shell (Ninella torquata). Therefore herbivorous activity may have been an additional controlling factor at some sites. Any assessment of long-term algal population changes is very difficult but there does seem to be a definite change in the composition of the whole transect when the two years 1975 and 1978 are considered. The distribution changes (Table 7) , the differences in composition of the rare species flora (Table 6 ) and the similarity coefficients (Table 8) , all do suggest a change in the algal populations between these years. Possible causes of such a change during the study period (if it is not part of a long-term cycle) are the effect of the particularly severe storm damage of 1973 or the release of sewage effluent some 30 m from Station A from August 1976 onwards. If the latter were the cause, a gradient of change might be shown with the stations furthest from the effluent outlet showing the least change. No such gradient was apparent in the analysis of the similarity coefficients (Table 8 ) but, since the stations are adjoining each other, the gradient might be expected to be slight at best except perhaps in Station A, which was nearer to the outfall site.",

Certainly, large changes in occupied space, available irradiance and water turbulence attended the re-establishment of large plants of E, radiata and P, comosa. However, this re-establishment of large plants occurred particularly only at Stations A and G, whereas the similarity coefficients (Table 8) indicated changes of similar magnitude at all stations throughout the transect. We are therefore unable to determine the cause of the changes that occurred in species composition and frequency; we merely demonstrate its occurrence. Although the cause of this drift over a matter of years is as yet undetermined, its 30* occurrence needs to be considered in such studies as environmental impact surveys. A comparison of marine floras based on observations taken over only two years is obviously inadequate. May (1981) demonstrated the occurrence of long term variation in algal intertidal floras, extending over several years. The present study indicates that such changes occur also in subtidal regions.",
