Making the tent involves combining two transparent plastic bags into a single bag large enough to be draped over the patient's head to chest. Two drip stands are used to hold the tent up. A videolaryngoscope and tracheal tube can be passed under the plastic tent for intubation. The C-MAC\u00ae (KARL STORZ Endoscopy (UK) Ltd) videolaryngoscope is shown because it has an external screen outside the tent that would provide a clear laryngoscopy view. The tent is disposed and the drip stands wiped down.",

Intubation is performed with the aid of the McGRATH\u2122 (Medtronic, USA) videolaryngoscope because of ease of cleaning compared with the C-MAC\u00ae. The plastic sheet can be left in the same position for the duration of the operation. If the patient needs to be in a lateral or beach chair position, the sheet is shifted correspondingly over the face.",

The length of the tent is sufficient to fall past the patient's pillow so that there is no contact between the intubating personnel and the patient. This protective tent can be modified for use in ICUs during suctioning, bronchoscopy, and other aerosol-generating procedures. The screen is similar to the tent and provides a tighter seal. We suggest leaving adequate holes at the sides and the head end for the airway team to access the patient.",
