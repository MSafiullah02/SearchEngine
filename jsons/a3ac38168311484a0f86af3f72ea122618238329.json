These blood cells are involved in the killing of infectious microbes, in cell-mediated immunity and the production of specific antibodies against the pathogens. Cu-deficient humans show an exceptional susceptibility to infections due to the decreased number and function of these blood cells. Besides, Cu can kill several infectious viruses such as bronchitis virus, poliovirus, human immunodeficiency virus type 1(HIV-1), other enveloped or nonenveloped, single-or double-stranded DNA and RNA viruses. Moreover, Cu has the potent capacity of contact killing of several viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Since the current outbreak of the COVID-19 continues to develop, and there is no vaccine or drugs are currently available, the critical option is now to make the immune system competent to fight against the SARS-CoV-2. Based on available data, we hypothesize that enrichment of plasma copper levels will boost both the innate and adaptive immunity in people. Moreover, owing to its potent antiviral activities, Cu may also act as a preventive and therapeutic regime against COVID-19.",

Coronaviruses were first described in 1966 by Tyrell and Bynoe, who cultivated the viruses from patients with common colds [26] . At present, no vaccines exist that protect people against infections by SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID- [29] ; however, it is not known whether they had lowered Cu levels too. Several studies have shown that lower total cholesterol level may be related in part due to lower Cu level in adults [21, 30, 31] . Disruption of lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion caused an enhancement of virus particles released from infected cells and a decrease in the infectivity of virus particles [32] . Plasma Cu may affect all these above processes. Cu oxide nanoparticles and Cu 2+ ions are involved in the inhibition of viral entry and replication, and degradation of mRNA and capsid proteins that are involved in the viral life cycle. Cu deficiency is not always about a lack of Cu but also could be the result of an imbalance of Cu and other minerals in the diet that may often occur in an older population. In older people, Cu deficiency can also result from malnutrition, malabsorption, or excessive zinc intake and can be acquired or inherited [28] . Copper deficiency could lead a decreased number of circulatory blood cells with a greater susceptibility towards infection in older people In a study of 11 men on a low-Cu diet (0.66 mg Cu/day for 24 days and 0.38 mg/day for another 40 days) showed a decreased proliferation response of their white blood cells when presented with an immune challenge in cell culture [33] . Recent mechanistic studies support a role for Cu in the innate immune response against infections [34] . In the condition of specific intestinal malabsorption (such as celiac disease, bowel syndrome, long-term parenteral nutrition) or bone abnormalities or in well genetically determined disease (Menkes' disease), Cu deficiency is severe with dysfunctions on immune response, antioxidant activity and bone metabolism [35] . Altered plasma and tissue levels of Cu in acute or chronic inflammation reflect the changes in the metabolism of Cu [36, 37] . We hypothesize that copper supplementation can help fight ",

While high copper levels can be poisonous, sites which are Cu limited can result in stress responses by pathogens that warrants that the Cu levels must be maintained optimally. At present, we do not have enough data or knowledge concerning the effect of therapeutic supplementation of Cu regarding the susceptibility and outcome of COVID-19. Dietary or therapeutic Cu supplementations might affect host immune function and metabolism of other micronutrients and prevent the severity of the viral infection. Therefore, supplementation of Cu and correction of mineral deficits may be beneficial for COVID-19 patients.

Besides, Cu can kill several and hydrogen peroxide play the essential roles [10]. The contact killing of bacteria, yeasts, and viruses on metallic Cu surfaces is well studied[11]. Cu supplementation was shown to restore the secretion and activity of IL-2 in Cu-deficient animals via increased synthesis of IL-2, which is crucial for T helper cell proliferation and NK cell cytotoxicity [12, 13].

The world is now desperate to find ways to slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and to find effective treatments. People with weakened immune systems are always at an increased risk of infectious diseases, and COVIDdeficiency could be due to limitations of screening using serum or urine samples. Cu deficiency is not usually about a lack of Cu, but an imbalance of Cu and other minerals in the diet that need to be supplemented with minerals and failure to do so may inhibit their potential to produce Cu that can lead to susceptibility towards infection. While severe Cu deficiency has adverse effects on immune function, the effects of Cu insufficiency in humans are not yet well known. In humans, the Cu status, tested by plasma Cu or ceruloplasmin or cuproenzymes, is strictly dependent by individual dietary habits and health status, and ultimately plasma ceruloplasmin levels. Serum level of Cu level is higher in pregnant women than that of nonpregnant women. In Wenzhou, China a study of 71 patients showed that those infected with COVID-19 have significantly lower total cholesterol levels in serum compared to healthy controls",

Compilation of data on toxicity due to copper excess and deficiency yielded a generalized linear model that was used to estimate adverse responses depending on copper dose or severity of copper limitation, as well as the duration of copper misbalance[38]. This model indicates that for humans, the optimal intake level for Cu is 2.6 mg/day. The current United States Recommended Daily Intake is only 0.9 mg (USA Food and Nutrition Board), whereas dietary study indicated that even 1.03 mg of Cu/day might be insufficient for adult men[39]. The results of the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES III, 2003)  in the USA showed that the mean daily intake of Cu, depending on age, was 1.54-1.7 mg/day for men and 1.13-1.18 mg/day for women. These results imply that a large portion of the population may have insufficient dietary copper intake and mild copper deficiency. We argue that Cu supplementation may have a protection of people from COVID-19.
