The estimated initial median of the basic reproduction (R0) was shown to be 2.79, meaning that one infected person will -on average -infect 2.79 other people, however R0 differs among various regions [3] . Besides, even asymptomatically infected persons or those presenting with minimal symptoms were found to be contagious [4] . Reports have already shown that the incubation period can be extended beyond 14 days, however, the vast majority of cases becomes symptomatic within 14 days [5] . The signs and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) are not specific and are therefore difficult to distinguish from those of other respiratory virus infections. The 70% sensitivity of a single nasopharyngeal swab performed early in the course of disease represents an additional obstacle in making an accurate diagnosis [6] . Delayed diagnoses were reported to be one of the leading reasons for nosocomial transmissions.",

Prompt identification of infected persons, their isolation and contact tracing might be sufficient to reduce viral transmission allowing control of a cluster of infected individuals.

Basically, ensuring cleanliness of toilets and other potentially contaminated surfaces is of extreme importance. Effective decontamination and strict environmental hygiene are crucial in elimination of respiratory droplets and faecal shedding from a contaminated healthcare environment [13] .
