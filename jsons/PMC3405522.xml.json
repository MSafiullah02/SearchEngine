Based on differences in the antigenicity and nucleotide sequences analysis, RSV strains have been classified in two major antigenic subgroups, denoted RSV A and RSV B (Sullender, 2000). RSV is a major cause of acute respiratory tract infections in children worldwide (Nair et al., 2010, Weber et al., 1998), and is responsible for a large proportion of hospital admissions during infancy and early childhood (Mejias et al., 2005). No vaccine is available, and treatment is limited to supportive care (Empey et al., 2010). RSV is also a frequent cause of nosocomial infections, and as such may significantly impact the duration of stay in hospital and healthcare costs during childhood (Macartney et al., 2000). Data on epidemiology and molecular virological characteristics of RSV isolates circulating in Southeast Asia are limited.",

            "text": "Diagnosis of RSV infection is typically performed on respiratory samples using virus culture, (rapid) antigen detection tests, or molecular assays (Henrickson, 2004). Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) provides a rapid and sensitive tool for detection of RSV compared to conventional techniques and enables (semi-)quantitation of viral load (Borg et al., 2003, Dewhurst-Maridor et al., 2004, do Nascimento et al., 2008, Empey et al., 2010, Falsey et al., 2003, Falsey et al., 2002, Henrickson, 2004, Houben et al., 2010, Hu et al., 2003, Kuypers et al., 2004, Mentel et al., 2003, Perkins et al., 2005, van de Pol et al., 2006, van de Pol et al., 2010, van Elden et al., 2003). The locked nucleic acid (LNA) technology increases thermal stability of probe-target interaction and improves discrimination of different nucleic acid targets (Reynisson et al., 2006). The N gene is the most conserved RSV gene across all known genetic clades, and is also expressed most abundantly during viral replication (David and Knipe, 2001, Johnson and Collins, 1989). For these reasons, the N gene was chosen as the target of a novel real-time RT-PCR diagnostic tool, to provide quantitative viral load analysis and discrimination between RSV A and B within a single assay. The quantitative assay was compared to a commercial conventional multiplex PCR method (Seeplex\u2122 RV detection kit, Seegene, Inc., Seoul, Korea) (Kim et al., 2009, Roh et al., 2008) using 264 respiratory samples from a study (Do et al., 2011) on acute respiratory infection in children at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Here, the development and validation of this assay is reported, as well as initial observations regarding subgroup diversity within Vietnamese RSV strains, and relationships between viral load and disease severity in Vietnamese patients.",

RSV subgroups A and B differ by 5 nucleotides within the highly conserved region of the N gene; two LNA probes, RSVA and RSV B (Sigma Proligo, Singapore), were designed to include three LNA residues at these sites (+T, +A and +T for RSV A; +C, +G and +A for RSV B). The choice of reporters and compatible quenchers was based on a Bio-Rad guideline (Biorade, 2006). Primers and probes were analyzed for false priming sites, hybridizations, and secondary structures at http://lnatools.com/hybridization. Plasmids containing the amplicons from RSV A and RSV B clinical strains were constructed for use as positive controls and generation of standard curves for quantitation. Briefly, target cDNAs amplified via RT-PCR from RSV A and RSV B-positive clinical specimens as identified by Seeplex\u2122 RV detection kit, were cloned into pCRII\u00ae-TOPO\u00ae vector and transformed into the TOPO-10 bacterial strain using the TOPA TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Clones were screened by PCR using M13 primers, and confirmed by sequencing (CEQ DTCS Quick Start Kit, CEQ 8000 Capillary Sequencer, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton (CA), USA). Quantitation of the plasmid preparations (ng/\u03bcl) was conducted using PicoGreen dsDNA Quantitation Reagent (Invitrogen) in duplicate, and the corresponding copy number of target cDNA in the plasmid was calculated (copies/mL). Serial 10-fold dilutions were made for analysis of analytical sensitivity and used as standard curves for viral load quantitation. Viral load was expressed as copies per mL of sample, A Ct-value of 45 was chosen as a cut-off value for standard positivity.",

Rapid and sensitive detection of RSV is important for installing infection control measures and thus preventing nosocomial spread, which has been recognized as a major risk in pediatric wards (Macartney et al., 2000). Several RT-PCR based methods and real-time RT-PCR have been described for RSV detection (Borg et al., 2003, Dewhurst-Maridor et al., 2004, do Nascimento et al., 2008, Falsey et al., 2003, Gueudin et al., 2003, Hu et al., 2003, Kuypers et al., 2006, Kuypers et al., 2004, Mentel et al., 2003, Perkins et al., 2005, van de Pol et al., 2006, van de Pol et al., 2010, van Elden et al., 2003). An improved PCR diagnostic tool using LNA probes targeting the most conserved region of the N gene was developed, to detect and distinguish simultaneously subgroup A and B and to quantify viral RNA load. An internal control virus (EAV) was added to each specimen in order to monitor efficiency of RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification. This assay exhibited an increased diagnostic yield, from 24% to 32%, compared to a commercial conventional multiplex PCR assay, the Seeplex\u2122 RV detection kit, and produced a diagnostic result within 4 h of sample receipt.",

Primers and probes were originally designed based on available N gene sequences from NCBI GenBank, including the two reference strains A2 and B. Twenty-four more recent submissions of N gene sequences from Cambodia showed perfect matches to these primers and probes. This indicates that these primers and probes theoretically could detect all currently known circulating strains of RSV. The 100% detection rate for 9.0 \u00d7 102\n copies/mL for RSV A and for 6.0 \u00d7 103\n copies/mL for RSV B are in the same range as previously published methods that used dilution series of plasmid DNA and, when re-calculated and assuming a 1:1 RT efficiency, as methods that used RNA transcripts (ranging from 103 to 106\n copies/mL) (Borg et al., 2003, Gueudin et al., 2003, Kuypers et al., 2004). Significant linear correlations of Ct values and copies/mL were observed at levels of viral load typically found in clinical specimens. In addition, the assay exhibited good analytical reproducibility as evidenced by intra- and inter-assay CVs ranging from 1% to 3%. CVs from other reported diagnostic approaches (based on copies/mL) ranged from 1% to 35.8% (Borg et al., 2003, Gueudin et al., 2003, Kuypers et al., 2004).",

The results of the current study confirm a negative correlation between RSV viral load and age, and significant difference in viral load between severe and non-severe patients (defined by admission status to the pediatric ICU versus the Respiratory ward). However, when the dataset was adjusted for age, differences between viral load and severity lost statistical significance.",
