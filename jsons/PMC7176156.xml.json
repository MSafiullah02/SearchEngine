            "text": "Myocardial dysfunction is a frequent organ manifestation during septic shock and the subsequent impairment in cardiac\noutput may result in organ hypoperfusion, requiring prompt and adequate treatment to restore cardiovascular function and\nreverse shock [1]. Current sepsis guidelines recommend resuscitation with\nintravascular fluid administration in association with inotropes and vasopressors to maintain organ perfusion [2]. Dobutamine is recommended as first-line inotropic agent and should be administered when\nlow cardiac output or signs of hypoperfusion persist after adequate fluid resuscitation and perfusion pressure have been\nachieved [2]. However, the efficacy of dobutamine in patients with heart\nfailure has not been fully demonstrated and concerns on its use are still present [3]. Although dobutamine improves perfusion and increases oxygen delivery\n(DO2), its impact on survival in septic shock patients is limited, with guideline recommendations\nbased mainly on the landmark study by Rivers et al. [4]. Recently, Wilkman\net al. [5] reported that the use of inotropes, particularly dobutamine, in\nseptic shock was associated with increased 90-day mortality. In explaining the lack of outcome benefit [3, 5], several aspects need to be taken into\naccount. First, the need of inotropic support may simply represent an expression of disease severity rather than the cause\nof a poor outcome. Second, whereas the treatment of impaired cardiac output should be tailored based on the etiological\nmechanism of the cardiovascular dysfunction, the current guidelines recommend the use of\ninotropes without differentiating the underlying causes of impaired left ventricular (LV) stroke volume [2, 6]. In addition, the majority of\ncardiovascular monitoring instruments provide data almost exclusively on cardiac output and pressures. This approach may\npotentially increase the number of patients who may be harmed by inotrope administration (Fig. 1). Finally, the beneficial short-term effect of enhanced contractility by cAMP-increasing drugs\n(e. g., dobutamine, milrinone) is, at least partly, abolished by the increased energy consumption, the worsening of\nventricular relaxation and the direct cardiomyocyte toxicity [1, 7\u201310].",

            "text": "Oldner et al. [24] demonstrated a marked improvement in cardiac\nindex (CI) and systemic DO2 following the administration of levosimendan in an experimental\nmodel of sepsis. Nevertheless, in parallel with the increase in CI, the authors observed a decrease in mean arterial\npressure (MAP) and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI). Other studies confirmed these preliminary findings. In\nisolated guinea pig hearts, incremental concentrations of levosimendan improved systolic function, with positive\neffects following concentrations > 0.03 \u00b5M [25]. An increase in LV\ncontractility was observed in two rabbit endotoxic models with animals receiving levosimendan at doses of 3.0 or\n3.3 \u00b5g/kg/min (with no loading dose) [26, 27]. In a study by Barraud et al. [27], changes were noticed in preload and load independent measurements, thus\nsuggesting a direct increase in contractility independent of volume status or changes in vascular\nproperties [21, 27]. Improved cardiac efficiency was indirectly confirmed by the ability of\nlevosimendan to increase systemic DO2 as well as mixed venous oxygen saturation\n(SvO2) [24, 26, 28]. In two recent studies,\naddition of levosimendan to arginine-vasopressin (AVP) improved global hemodynamics and resulted in a survival\nbenefit compared to AVP infusion alone or placebo in animals with septic shock secondary to generalized\nperitonitis [29, 30].",

            "text": "In contrast to the experimental models, extensive clinical data on levosimendan to treat septic myocardial\ndepression are still lacking and are mainly restricted to small single center trials with its use described for the\nfirst time in a case report in 2005 [11]. Our research\ngroup [12] performed the first clinical trial aimed at evaluating the\neffects of levosimendan in septic shock patients. Patients with septic shock with persistent LV ejection fraction\n(LVEF) < 45 % after 48 h of standard therapy (volume substitution, norepinephrine and dobutamine) were randomized\nto receive levosimendan (0.2 \u00b5g/kg/min infusion without preceding bolus) or dobutamine infusion (5 \u00b5g/kg/min) for\n24 h. Norepinephrine was titrated to maintain MAP at 70\u201380 mmHg. In this study, we observed an increase in CI and\nLVEF following levosimendan infusion. Levosimendan was also superior to dobutamine in improving end-diastolic and\nend-systolic volume index and LV stroke work index (LVSWI). Although we did not perform a direct evaluation of\ncardiac contractility, our findings suggest that overall myocardial function was improved (Fig. 2). This assumption is also supported by the observed increases in oxygen delivery and\nconsumption (vs. baseline) and the decrease in arterial lactate (vs. baseline and dobutamine) observed 24 h after\nlevosimendan infusion, indicating an improvement in global tissue oxygenation. Importantly, we did not find\na decrease in MAP or an increase in norepinephrine requirements [12]. Although one could anticipate that a higher dose of dobutamine (10, 15, or\n20 \u00b5g/kg/min as suggested by current guidelines) would have produced the same beneficial effects as levosimendan on\nhemodynamics, the increased risk of adverse effects also needs to be taken into account. An improvement in global\nhemodynamics following levosimendan infusion was observed by the same group in patients with acute respiratory\ndistress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock [13] and by Powell\nand De Keulenaer [14] in a case series of septic shock patients. More recently,\nBusani et al. [31] reported an increase in myocardial contractility\nafter switching from dobutamine (up to 8 \u00b5g/kg/min) to levosimendan (0.1 \u00b5g/kg/min) in a case of fulminant\nperi-myocarditis associated with influenza A/H1N1 virus.",

            "text": "Diastolic dysfunction is strongly associated with age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery\ndisease. In view of the growing elderly and morbid patient population treated in modern ICUs, the number of septic\npatients who will suffer from diastolic dysfunction is likely to increase in the future [32]. Patients with septic shock frequently have both systolic and diastolic\ndysfunction. Whereas patients with systolic dysfunction have better survival and myocardial dysfunction recovers if\npatients survive the septic course [18], diastolic dysfunction does not\nimprove and is associated with high mortality [33]. Although it is\nconceivable that diastolic dysfunction is a pre-existing condition in the majority of septic patients [33], one cannot exclude that in these patients diastolic dysfunction can be\naggravated not only by the disease per se but also by the treatment, especially\nif echocardiography is not performed. Correct hemodynamic management is crucial to prevent worsening of diastolic\ndysfunction in septic shock. As a consequence of down-regulation of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, dobutamine loses its\nlusitropic effect due to hyperphosphorylation of troponin I, a condition that renders the myocytes refractory to\nfurther phosphorylation in response to dobutamine [27]. More\nimportantly, dobutamine, by increasing heart rate and inducing tachyarrhythmia, may dramatically worsen diastolic\ndysfunction. Conversely, levosimendan binds to cTnC in a calcium-dependent manner. It dissociates from cTnC when\ncalcium concentration decreases during diastole, thereby acting only during systole and not impairing diastolic\nmyocardial relaxation [20, 21]. In addition, since levosimendan causes a significant decrease in sympathetic\nnervous system activity, its administration is not associated with an increase in heart rate, allowing better\nventricular filling during diastole. In this regard, Barraud et al. [27] demonstrated that in contrast to dobutamine, levosimendan produced a parallel\nenhancement of myocardial contractility and improvement in LV diastolic function in experimental septic\nshock.",

            "text": "The vasodilatory effects of levosimendan may play a pivotal role in improving cardiac performance in patients\nwith septic myocardial dysfunction. The matching between the ventricle and arterial load is crucial to provide\nadequate blood flow to the peripheral tissues. A sufficient cardiac output is the net result of various combinations\nof myocardial contractility (stroke volume) and afterload (systemic vascular resistance) and the cardiovascular\nsystem chooses any combination of these to optimize coupling between the ventricle and the arterial\nsystem [6, 34]. The maximum\nefficiency of the cardiovascular system with the lowest energy costs is obtained when the whole pulsating energy\nproduced by the left heart is transmitted downstream to the peripheral regions [6, 34]. Ventriculo-arterial coupling,\nthe ratio between arterial elastance and ventricular elastance, has therefore been, recognized as an accurate index\nof cardiovascular performance. When this ratio is near unity, the efficiency of the system is optimal. In this case,\nthe left ventricle provides an adequate stroke volume with the lowest possible energy consumption [6, 34]. Patients with septic myocardial\ndysfunction may present some degree of ventriculo-arterial uncoupling, because of an imbalance between increased\narterial elastance induced by pharmacological vasoconstriction and decreased ventricular elastance depending on the\nreduction in myocardial contractility [6]. Ventriculo-arterial\nuncoupling may, therefore, worsen or contribute to septic myocardial dysfunction. This assumption is supported by an\nechocardiographic evaluation performed in a series of septic shock patients [35]. Among the 67 patients investigated, 14 patients without global LV hypokinesia\nat admission, developed the condition after 24 hrs or 48 hrs of continuous norepinephrine infusion. Although this\nchange could have been related to the progression of the disease, one cannot exclude that increasing LV afterload\nwith norepinephrine impaired ventriculo-arterial coupling, leading to myocardial failure. According to\nguidelines [2], the secondary LV hypokinesia observed in\nthese patients was corrected by addition of dobutamine to the hemodynamic support [35]. Because dobutamine may restore the ratio between arterial elastance and\nventricular elastance by increasing only the latter, the cardiac energetics of such a strategy may be unfavorable,\nespecially if prolonged. Furthermore, frequency potentiation of contractile function is a major mechanism for the\nincrease in myocardial performance thanks to an improvement in ventricular-arterial coupling. Conversely, in the\nfailing heart, such as the septic heart, this positive force-frequency relation is impaired with\nventricular-arterial coupling that becomes negatively affected by tachycardia [34]. Therefore, in septic myocardial dysfunction, dobutamine may further worsen\nventricular-arterial coupling by inducing tachycardia [6, 34]. By contrast, levosimendan improves ventriculo-arterial coupling by acting on\nboth myocardial and arterial elastance. Due to the enhancement of calcium sensitivity to contractile proteins, this\ndrug also restores the positive force-frequency relation and prevents tachycardia-induced adverse effects on\nventicular-arterial coupling [34]. Thus, levosimendan repairs\nventriculo-arterial uncoupling better than dobutamine because of greater inotropic effects with less energy\nexpenditure and additional vasodilatory effects [6, 35]. With the same mechanisms, levosimendan, by positively affecting right\nventriculo-arterial coupling, improves right ventricular (RV) performance and pulmonary hemodynamics. This effect\nmay be of great importance because patients with septic shock may develop an increase in RV afterload leading to RV\ndysfunction. In the experimental setting, it has been reported that levosimendan decreased mean pulmonary artery\npressure as well as pulmonary vascular resistance, without impairing arterial blood oxygenation [24, 28\u201330, 36]. In 35 patients with ARDS and\nseptic shock, levosimendan infusion contributed to a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance. The subsequent\nreduction in RV afterload was associated with a significant increase in RVEF compared to the control group,\nsuggesting an improvement in RV systolic function also [13]. In harmony\nwith our previous study [12], global hemodynamics were improved\nfollowing levosimendan infusion [13]. A decrease in pulmonary vascular\nresistance was also noted in case series from Noto et al. [11] and\nPowell and De Keulenaer [14].",

            "text": "The vasodilatory effects of levosimendan may also be effective in improving regional blood flow. Maintaining\nadequate splanchnic perfusion, particularly of the gastrointestinal mucosa, is crucial because splanchnic\nhypoperfusion is implicated in the activation of the inflammatory response and subsequent multiple organ\nfailure [17]. Several vasoactive drugs have been used in an attempt to\nprevent hepatosplanchnic ischemia and to improve intestinal perfusion. Nevertheless, the efficacy of vasoactive\nagents in preserving splanchnic blood flow or preventing gastrointestinal mucosal ischemia has not been\ndemonstrated. Levosimendan, by increasing cardiac output and simultaneously redistributing perfusion toward\nsplanchnic regions by its additional vasodilatory activity, might be a prophylactic or therapeutic option to support\nthe integrity of the gastrointestinal mucosa and to preserve splanchnic perfusion during septic shock. In animal\nmodels of septic shock, levosimendan was associated with reduced gut vascular resistance, increased portal venous\nblood flow, increased splanchnic oxygen delivery and consumption, as well as increased mucosal\nO2 saturation and reduced intramucosal partial pressure of carbon dioxide\n(PiCO2) [24, 28, 36]. These effects were more\npronounced following levosimendan administration when compared with dobutamine [28]. Our research group previously demonstrated that levosimendan compared to\ndobutamine (5 \u00b5g/kg/min) increased gastric mucosal perfusion, decreased the PCO2 gradient and\nincreased capillary blood flow in patients with septic myocardial depression [12]. In a study by Memi\u015f et al. [37],\nlevosimendan improved liver perfusion to a greater extent than dobutamine (10 \u00b5g/kg/min) in a series of septic shock\npatients. Of note, previous studies [12, 38] reported that levosimendan decreased serum lactate more than dobutamine did,\nalthough there was no difference between the two drugs with regard to their effects on central venous oxygen\nsaturation (ScvO2) [38]. These findings suggest\nan improvement in regional hemodynamics following levosimendan infusion. On the other hand, Hernandez\net al. [39] very recently demonstrated that dobutamine (5 \u00b5g/kg/min)\nfailed to improve metabolic, hepatosplanchnic or peripheral perfusion parameters despite inducing a significant\nincrease in systemic hemodynamic variables in septic shock patients without low cardiac output but with persistent\nhypoperfusion. Kidney dysfunction is common among septic shock patients and may be associated with poor\noutcome. Levosimendan induces vasodilation, preferentially of the pre-glomerular resistance vessels, increasing both\nrenal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without jeopardizing renal oxygenation [40]. We previously reported that in addition to the effects on gastric mucosal flow,\nlevosimendan increased creatinine clearance and urinary output [12,\n40].",

In this regard, inotropes have\nbeen investigated to improve microcirculatory blood flow in patients with septic shock. De Backer\net al. [41] reported that dobutamine improved the microcirculation in\na series of septic shock patients. In contrast, in a very recent study, similar dobutamine doses (5 \u00b5g/kg/min)\nfailed to improve microcirculatory blood flow [39]. Interestingly, in\nthe study by De Backer et al. [41], the subsequent addition of\na topical vasodilator, acetylcholine, completely restored sublingual capillary perfusion, supporting the hypothesis\nthat stronger vasodilatory compounds, such as levosimendan, may be more effective than dobutamine in improving\nmicrocirculatory blood flow. The physiological implication is that because of their vasodilatory effects, such\ncompounds may improve microcirculatory blood flow by increasing the driving pressure of blood flow at the entrance\nof the microcirculation [41]. In line with this assumption, we\ndemonstrated that compared to a standard dose of 5 \u00b5g/kg/min of dobutamine, levosimendan at 0.2 \u00b5g/kg/min improved\nmicrocirculatory blood flow in patients with septic shock [15]. Interestingly, the improvement in microvascular perfusion was independent of\nchanges in cardiac output. This finding suggests that effects of levosimendan at the level of the endothelium, such\nas the ability to decrease cytokine synthesis, plasma levels of endothelin-1, intercellular adhesion molecule\n(ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 [20], may have\ncontributed to the improvement in the microcirculation.",

            "text": "Evidence supports the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction and consequent cellular energetic failure may play\na key role in the development of sepsis-related organs failure and thus myocardial dysfunction [17, 42]. The mechanisms of such\nmitochondrial dysfunction are extremely complex and involve an excessive production of ROS, such as superoxide,\nperoxynitrite and NO, directly inhibiting activities of the respiratory chain complexes [42]. Compounds that have the ability to open the KATP channels in\nthe plasma membrane of smooth cells, such as levosimendan, may also act on the KATP channels\nlocated at the level of mitochondria. This latter activity may be particularly relevant, because the stimulation of\nK+ flux through mitochondrial KATP has been demonstrated to maintain\ncellular energy homeostasis and to protect mitochondria from oxidative injury [20]. In this regard, all available clinical data show an increase in\nSvO2 following levosimendan administration, which may be related not only to an improvement in\nsystemic hemodynamics but also to a better energetic substrate utilization by mitochondria. Evidence also suggests that\nlevosimendan exerts antioxidant activity and ischemic preconditioning [20,\n43]. Whether levosimendan may protect mitochondria and improve energy\nfailure in the presence of multifactorial damage, such as the septic insult, is still unclear. By performing muscle\nbiopsies in a series of septic shock patients, we found that 24 h levosimendan administration at a dose of 0.2 \u00b5g/kg/min\nincreased antioxidant defense and was able to enhance the protein level of two defective respiratory chain enzymes,\ncomplex I and III (unpublished data). These preliminary unpublished data suggest that levosimendan may protect\nmitochondria from oxidative stress during septic shock and, potentially, confront the bioenergetic defect through\nstimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis.",

            "text": "Opening of KATP channels in response to levosimendan administration typically is associated\nwith significant vasodilation increasing the risk of hypotension. Nevertheless, in the presence of an adequate volume\nstatus, the decrease in blood pressure may be limited by a simultaneous increase in cardiac output [21]. In this context, it is especially important to underline that the vasodilatory\neffects of levosimendan are dose-dependent and most pronounced if a loading bolus is administered. In the presence of\nseptic shock, levosimendan should, therefore, only be given when adequate fluid resuscitation can be assured. Since the\nmajority of patients suffering from septic myocardial dysfunction do not require an immediate increase in myocardial\ncontractility, it is reasonable to continuously infuse levosimendan without a preceding loading bolus dose [44]. Data from the available clinical studies suggest that in the presence of adequate\nvolume status and maintained perfusion pressure with norepinephrine, use of levosimendan is a safe and effective\nalternative to increasing dobutamine doses in treating the failing heart of septic shock patients. Notably, levosimendan\nis the only inotrope that is not associated with increased mortality in patients with septic shock [5]. This finding assumes importance in light of the fact that levosimendan is used rather\nas a last resort treatment than as a first-line agent. In most cases, levosimendan is administered in shock states\nrefractory to conventional inotropes, in a final attempt to save a patient\u2019s life. For many such patients, however,\nthis may be too late to adequately reverse organ failure, as underlined by Bollen Pinto et al. [21].",

Due to its mechanism of action, levosimendan lowers catecholamine\nconcentrations and thus reduces cardiotoxicity. By its vasodilating properties, levosimendan may improve both cardiac\nperformance and regional hemodynamics. In addition to these hemodynamic properties, non-hemodynamic effects of\nlevosimendan may further contribute to improvements in microvascular blood flow and thus organ perfusion. Moreover,\nlevosimendan has no significant effect on platelets and does not affect blood coagulation [45]. Finally, levosimendan may positively affect several other pathophysiological\npathways, such as ischemia-reperfusion injuries, apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress, which all contribute to\nworsen septic myocardial dysfunction. Taking into account these effects, levosimendan seems to be the closest available\ndrug to an ideal vasoactive agent for improving septic myocardial dysfunction. Although extensive clinical data are\nstill lacking, the efficacy of levosimendan in treating septic myocardial dysfunction is strengthened by the evidence of\nincreasing use of this drug by ICU physicians for the hemodynamic management of septic shock [46].",
