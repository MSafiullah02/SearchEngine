UCSF is a tertiary care university hospital with a large associated primary care clinic. The UCSF Acute Ambulatory Care Clinic is the primary referral clinic for patients sent from the UCSF primary care clinic for evaluation of nonurgent medical problems, whereas the Emergency Department evaluates acutely ill patients. Symptoms of ARI were defined as development of a new illness within the past 3 weeks with cough, sinus pain, congestion, sore throat, or fever. Patients with the following noninfectious, self-reported conditions were excluded: pregnancy, systemic inflammatory disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or inflammatory bowel disease), coexistent infections, severe tissue damage within the previous 7 days (e.g., trauma, surgery, or burns), myocardial infarction or unstable angina, cancer (metastatic or untreated), and AIDS or other immunosuppressive disorders.",

Another early study of upper respiratory infection involving 221 adults identified a viral etiology with use of isolation methods in 34% of the patients [22]. With use of a combination of isolation and serological testing, a study involving 278 college students with respiratory symptoms found an etiology in 32% of the patients [23].

The improved detection rate of PCR for specific individual respiratory agents (e.g., rhinovirus, enterovirus, human coronavirus, and parainfluenza virus) has been shown by others, but our study is one of the few to compare PCR with nonmolecular methods for a broad array of pathogens [1, 3, 4, 6, 13, 16].",

Studies conducted in the winter months and specifically focusing on adults have also found a low prevalence of ARI caused by rhinovirus [22\u201324]. These studies relied on culture-based methods and may have underestimated true rates of infection. However, more recent studies using PCR have also identified high incidences of rhinovirus infection in the spring and fall, when rhinovirus can account for as much as 80% of ARI in healthy adults, and much lower prevalences of rhinovirus infection (up to 4%) in the winter months [1, 23, 28\u201330]. In contrast, 10% of the patients in our study were infected with rhinovirus, suggesting that rhinoviruses cause more cases of ARI during the influenza season than has previously been suspected.",

Recent studies have recognized the importance of RSV in the elderly population, in adults with underlying malignancy and cardiopulmonary disease, and as a cause of nosocomial infections [31]. Our results concur with those of other studies identifying RSV as an important cause of ARI in previously healthy adults, including a PCR-based study that identified RSV as a cause of up to 20% of cases of influenza-like illness [5, 32].",

            "text": "Our findings have important clinical implications. Early studies established a correlation between circulation of influenza virus in the community and concurrent increases in the incidence of severe ARI, hospitalizations for pneumonia, and influenza-associated mortality [36]. This led some to conclude that, when influenza is circulating within the community, patients with specific clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., cough and fever within 48 h after onset of symptoms) are likely to have influenza and may benefit from empiric antiviral therapy to reduce the duration of illness and the number of influenza-associated hospitalizations [37\u201339]. However, these recommendations are based on retrospective pooled analysis of antiviral clinical trials, in which the inclusion criteria required presence of fever and/or symptom of fever, which may have conferred a selection bias. In our study, the major clinical differences among the most common agents\u2014influenza, rhinovirus, and RSV\u2014were the presence of myalgias with influenza and fever with influenza and RSV. A finding of wheezing on examination was associated with rhinovirus or RSV infection. The association of wheezing with both rhinovirus and RSV infection has been described and has been postulated to be due to increased bronchial reactivity caused by airway injury, diminished \u03b2-adrenergic function, IgE production, and enhanced leukocyte histamine release [40]. When assessing patients with nonspecific symptoms of influenza-like illness, these additional clinical clues may be of use to the clinician considering the benefits and drawbacks of prescribing antiviral therapy, which can be expensive or may have associated adverse effects. For example, the adamantane drugs are associated with CNS-related adverse events, particularly in the elderly population, and oseltamivir can cause adverse gastrointestinal effects [34].",
