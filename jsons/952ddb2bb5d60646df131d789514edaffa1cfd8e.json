We propose a differential equation governing the evolution of the COVID-19. This dynamic equation also describes the evolution of the number of infected people for 13 common respiratory viruses (including the COVID-19). We validate our theoretical predictions with experimental data for Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg, and compare them with the predictions of the logistic model. We find that our predictions are in good agreement with the real world since the beginning of the appearance of the COVID-19; this is not the case for the logistic model that only applies to the first days. The second part of the work is devoted to modelling the descending phase, i.e. the decrease of the number of people tested positive for COVID-19. Also in this case, we propose a new set of dynamic differential equations that we solved numerically. We use our differential equations parametrised with experimental data to make several predictions, such as the date when Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg will reach a peak number of COVID-19 infected people. We shall see that the descending curves provide valuable information such as the duration of the COVID-19 epidemic in a given Country (and therefore when it will be possible to return to normal life) or how long we will still have to undergo the lockdown measures.",

Although respiratory infections can be classified according to the causative agent (e.g. Figure 1 : Schematic dynamics of respiratory virus in the absence of the lockdown measures (for simplicity, we illustrate the case R = 5) After a period of time \u00b5 1 , an infected individual is able to infect R individuals. In turn, after a period \u00b5 2 , each of them will be able to infect other R people and so on. After n steps the elapsed time is t = n i=1 \u00b5 i . the flu), they are mostly clinically classified according to the type of syndrome (e.g., common cold, bronchiolitis, laryngo-tracheo-bronchitis acute, pneumonia). Although pathogens typically cause characteristic clinical manifestations (e.g., rhinovirus causes the common cold, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV] usually causes bronchiolitis), they can all cause many of the most common respiratory syndromes. The severity of viral respiratory disease is highly variable; serious illness is more frequent in elderly patients and young children. Morbidity can either directly result from the infecting agent, or may be indirect. The latter case can be due to the exacerbation of an underlying cardiopulmonary disease, or a bacterial superinfection of the lung, paranasal sinuses, or middle ear. The main motivation of this work is to verify, by making theoretical predictions, that political decisions are truly effective to minimise the number of infected people in order to (i) not overload local health services (such as hospitals), and to (ii) gain time to allow research institutes to deliver vaccines or the anti-virals. Tables (1) and (2) respectively provide the experimental data for Italy [2] and for Belgium [3] , [4] . They show the number of active people (i.e., people currently infected by COVID-10), the recovered people, and deaths for COVID-19. We start our theoretical analysis by introducing the definition of R, defined as the ability of an individual, infected by a virus, to transmit the infection to other individuals on his turn, in the absence of lockdown measures. This parameter is strictly linked to the replication time of a virus, indicated with \u00b5 i , defined as the time interval after which the number of infected people has increased by R times. Fig. 1 schematically represents the diffusion dynamics of the virus. By indicating with N the number of infected people, after n steps we get:",

Then suddenly they activate and become virulent as they say, the infectious capacity grows to a maximum, after which it decreases. The time duration, explains R. Ronchetti, is about of 2 or 3 months. So we can expect that the epidemic will soon die out in Italy too. So, there is no valid reason to think that this coronavirus behaves differently from others [7] . The present work starts from the following hypothesis: the COVID-19 behaves exactly like the other viruses that cause respiratory diseases. As a consequence, for the COVID-19 case, functions K(t) and c(t) are determined by performing several fittings on the growth rate-trends of infection capacity of the viruses that mainly affect the respiratory system. More specifically, we consid- In all the examined cases, we took into account the fact that the therapy-induced death rate is greater than the baseline proliferation rate, then there is the eradication of the disease. In other words, the function c(t) in Eq. (13) represents the therapy-induced death rate [8] - [15] . Of course, this is an oversimplified model of both the growth and the therapy (e.g., it does not take into account the phenomenon of clonal resistance). We empirically noticed (according to the \u03c7 2 test) that all these viruses have in common the same growth rate-trend of infected people (of course, each of these behaviours have their own growth rate parameters). In particular, we noticed that the trends of the infected people by respiratory viruses versus time follow the function",

The value of the (time-independent) rate \u03b1 r represents the proportional increase of the recovered population r t in one unit of time. However, as the number of hospitalised people increases, the emergency departments become more and more saturated, until when they will no longer be able to accept other sick people, by causing a reduction of the recovered people 6 . This antagonistic effect is modelled by introducing a second term in the equation, \u2212\u03b1 r /K r r t , where the (time-independent) parameter K r is linked to the hospital's capacity to accept sick people. The competition between these two effects diminishes the combined growth rate, until the value of r t decreases to grow.

Through fitting techniques previously performed and validated by the \u03c7 2 -tests, we proposed a general analytical expression and a three-free parameters function (see Eq. (14) ) providing the number of people infected by respiratory viruses over time. We showed that this expression is solution of the Richard's differential equation subject to the adoption of lockdown measures. The differential equation (16) can be proposed for 13 respiratory in- fectious diseases caused by viruses, including the COVID-19. Successively, we compared the theoretical predictions, provided by the solution of Eq. (16) and by the logistic model (see Eq. (8)), with the real data for Italy and Belgium (for Luxembourg see Appendix). We saw that the solution of Eq. (16) is in good agreement with the experimental data since the beginning of the appearance of the COVID-19; this is not the case for the logistic model which applies only to the few last days. We found the days where the maximum number infected people by COVID-19 will be reached in Italy and Belgium by parametrising the solution of Eq. (16) with experimental data: we get, t M axIT 15 April 2020 and t M axBE 21 April 2020 for Italy and Belgium, respectively. We also noted, empirically, that the infection process by COVID-19 may be divided into three qualitatively different periods; i.e., the exponential period, the transient period and the bell-shaped period (or the post-transient period ). The solution of Eq. (16) allows defining more precisely these three periods. Indeed, we may classify the above periods as follows",

Also in this case, we proposed a new set of dynamic differential equations that we solved numerically. The solution of Eqs (28) (and Eq. (29)) provided valuable information such as the duration of the COVID-19 epidemic in a given Country (and therefore when it will be possible to return to normal life) or how long we will still have to undergo the lockdown measures.",

From a mathematical point of view, we would like to have R = 1 (or, better, R < 1), in Eq. (3) instead of R > 1. In practical terms, this means reducing the frequency of all involuntary contacts with a large number of people, reducing unnecessary movements to avoid encounters, and to prolong the closure of schools. Although these measures cannot prevent the spread of the infection in the long term, they can reduce the number of new infections daily. This has the benefit of leaving room for seriously-ill patients by avoiding to overload the healthcare system. We can easily realise what are the consequences if the lockdown measures are not set up. To make a comparison between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data in absence of lockdown measures, we have to consider the correct reference period.",
