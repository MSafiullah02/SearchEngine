Numerous animal coronaviruses, which are molecularly similar to human coronaviruses, have been shown to invade (neuroinvasion), infect (neurotropism), and induce neurological disease (neurovirulence) in animal models [1, 2]. A neuroradiologist should be aware of the potential mechanisms involved in the neuropathogenesis of this virus, as we begin to see cases with abnormal brain scans emerging from all parts of the world.",

However, patients are also known to demonstrate adverse neurological symptoms in the form of anosmia, dysgeusia, headache, nausea and vomiting [4]. ACE2 is widely expressed throughout the human brain, mostly in the glial cells, but also in the brainstem nuclei that regulate the cardiorespiratory systems, the reticular activating system, and in the motor cortex [1]. The propensity for accumulation in the nucleus solitarius and nucleus ambiguus, both of which play a key role in the modulation of respiratory function, is of research interest in its contribution to the severe respiratory dysfunction [5].",

[9], the authors describe a female COVID-19 patient in her late fifties presenting with altered sensorium and neuroimaging features typical of ANE. Cytokines are known to have a central role in the pathogenesis of acute necrotising encephalopathy [10]. This case highlights a possible association between COVID-19 and ANE. Interestingly, there is another form of ANE, referred to as ANE1 which has very similar imaging characteristics. ANE1 is associated with an underlying RAN binding protein 2 (RANBP2) mutations. RANBP2 is a protein present on the nuclear pore and facilitates cellular traffic of proteins and energy balancing [11]. A mutation of this gene makes individuals susceptible to the effects of viral infections. While the imaging manifestations of ANE 1 are similar to that provided in the case, it would be highly atypical for the initial manifestation of ANE 1 to occur in a patient of this age. However, as we continue to learn more about the COVID-19, one needs to keep an open mind about underlying genetic susceptibilities irrespective of the COVID-19 status of the patient. Further, raised CSF protein (>0.45 g/L) in the absence of CSF pleocytosis and the presence of external capsular involvement on imaging would also satisfy screening criteria for RANBP2 [11, 12].",
