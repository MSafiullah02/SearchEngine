In absence of effective vaccines, infection prevention and control 27 through diagnostic testing and quarantine is critical. Early detection and differential 28 diagnosis of respiratory infections increases the chances for successful control of 29 COVID-19 disease. The nucleic acid RT-PCR test is regarded as the current standard 30 for molecular diagnosis with high sensitivity. However, the highest specificity 31 confirmation target ORF1ab gene is considered to be less sensitive than other targets 32 in clinical application. In addition, a large amount of recent evidence indicates that the 33 initial missed diagnosis of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 and discharged 34 patients with \"re-examination positive\" may be due to low viral load, and the ability 35 of rapid mutation of coronavirus also increases the rate of false negative results. We 36 aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of different nucleic acid detection kits so as to make 37 recommendations for the selection of validation kit, and amplify the suspicious result 38 to be reportable positive by means of simple continuous amplification, which is of 39 great significance for the prevention and control of the current epidemic and the 40 discharge criteria of low viral load patients.",

With an 207 increasing number of potential cases emerge, the SARS-CoV-2 poses a major threat to 208 global public health[34]. A greater number of diagnostic tools have been developed 209 such as virus isolation, PCR-based assays, IHC, and antibody assays, which are 210 currently in place across different diagnostic laboratories around the world[35, 36]. 211 Although, RT-PCR is challenged by the \"false negative\" results[37], in view of the 212 past major epidemic outbreaks [38], RT-PCR is still the preferred detection method, 213 and how to ensure the accuracy of nucleic acid test results is the currently facing 214 problem. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the sensitivity of different RT-PCR kits 215 for COVID-19 diagnosis. 216 Different target genes of SARS-CoV-2 were used in countries 217 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/laboratory-guidance), while some 218 scholars believe that the detection of N gene is an accurate, rapid, early and simple 219 diagnostic method for COVID-19[39]. Then, under the current circumstance, can the 220 single target N or double targets N and E be judged as positive for SARS-CoV-2? An 221 increasing number of articles showed that the SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing rapid 222 mutation [40, 41]. Ninety-three mutations were found over the entire genomes of 223 SARS-CoV-2 [42] with twenty-nine missense mutations in the ORF1ab region and 224 four in the N region (table1).

Due to the difficulty to 232 distinguish the mild COVID-19 with influenza virus [44-46], China CDC has made it 233 clearly that influenza testing should be combined with SARS-CoV-2 testing [47]. 234 Although the detection rate of viral nucleic acid is closely related to the course of 235 viral infection, which is not completely clear and the optimal sampling time is 236 uncertain, so it is likely that the period of high viral load in the nasopharyngeal swab 237 samples will be missed, resulting in false negatives[48]. The nasopharyngeal swabs 238 are the most common samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection, while the stool samples are 239 reported as a good test target during treatment recently[49], and the positive fecal 240 nucleic acid has an important correlation with the development of the patient's disease 241 course, which may become an important indicator for the evaluation of therapeutic 242 efficacy and discharge criteria. 243 As with all viral nucleic acid testing projects, the RT-PCR results of SARS-CoV-2 244 are affected by various factors including before, during and after detection, thus 245 sufficient laboratory quality-control measures should be taken.
