            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry (1). Coronaviruses have been widely identified as causing respiratory and intestinal infections in humans after the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Guangdong, China in 2002 and 2003 (2, 3). SARS was determined to be caused by SARS-CoV and emerged in a market where civets were sold (2, 3). Only a decade later, the world witnessed another outbreak in the form of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV in the Middle East (4, 5). While the researchers were still investigating the underlying mechanisms of pathogenicity and developing effective therapeutic strategies against MERS, the world witnessed the deadliest outbreak in the form of COVID-19 (6). The causative coronavirus of this outbreak was named SARS-CoV-2 due to its resemblance to SARS-CoV (7\u20139). The SARS-CoV infects ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type-II pneumocytes through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor (2, 10). MERS infects unciliated bronchial epithelial cells and type-II pneumocytes by using dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), also known as CD26, as a receptor (2, 11). The mechanisms associated with the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 are not clear, however, structural analysis suggests it is likely entering human cells through the ACE2 receptor (12). This newly emerged virus has much greater similarity to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV, thus both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 may cause pathogenesis through similar mechanisms. The transmission of SARS-CoV to humans was reported from market civets, while that of MERS-CoV was from dromedary camels (13, 14). Similarly, the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 also appears to be transmitted to humans from markets where wild animals are sold (8). However, the zoonotic source of its transmission is not yet clear. According to previous reports, the aforementioned three coronaviruses are thought to have originated in bats (2, 11, 15, 16).",

Considering the adverse outcomes of the current COVID-19 epidemic, developing effective therapeutic strategies is necessary to cope with the lack of effective drugs, high mortality rate, and the potential of the virus to cause further epidemics. In this review, we focus on the origin, evolution, and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. We also discuss the therapeutic options for SARS-CoV-2 given its importance in the current scenario of COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China.

            "text": "Coronaviruses are members of the subfamily Coronavirinae (family Coronaviridae; order Nidovirales), which contains four genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (2). Gamma- and deltacoronaviruses generally infect birds, although some of them can cause infection in mammals, whereas, alpha- and betacoronaviruses are known to harm humans and animals. The viruses SARS-CoV (betacoronavirus), 229E (alphacoronavirus), HKU1 (betacoronavirus), NL63 (alphacoronavirus), OC43 (betacoronavirus), and MERS-CoV (betacoronavirus) can all cause infections in humans (2). However, betacoronaviruses are the most important group because they comprise the most highly pathogenic viruses against humans, including SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV (2, 18, 19). The highly pathogenic MERS and SARS coronaviruses originated in bats (2, 18, 19), however, the origin of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 remains debatable. Investigations have revealed that the SARS-CoV strains detected in market civets (20, 21) were transmitted from horseshoe bats (22). These viruses were found to be phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV in bats from China, Europe, Southeast Asia, and Africa (2, 22, 23). In addition, the genome sequences of SARS-CoV strains isolated from humans were highly similar to those in bats (21). However, some variations were found among the S gene and ORF3 and ORF8 gene sequences, which encode a binding and fusion protein and dispensable proteins for replication, respectively (2, 23). Nevertheless, clade2 of the S genetic region (22, 24), ORF8 (23), and ORF3b in SARS-CoV from bats contain major variations compared to SARS-CoV from humans (23).",

Phylogenetic analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 is genetically distinct from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, homology modeling reveals that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have similar receptor-binding domain structures, despite amino acid variation at some key residues, including the absence of the 8a protein and the fluctuation in the number of amino acids in the 8b and 3c proteins in SARS-CoV2 (29). In contrast, the primary protease is highly conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, with a 96% overall identity (30). These observations suggest that bats are the source of origin, while an animal sold at the Wuhan seafood market might represent an intermediate host facilitating the emergence of the virus in humans (12, 31).",

            "text": "After the emergence of SARS-CoV in the Guangdong province of China, it rapidly spread around the globe (2, 3). During November 2002, an epidemic of pneumonia with a high rate of transmission to other people occurred in Guangdong, China (32), followed by subsequent outbreaks in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, a total of 138 people contracted the infection within 2 weeks after the exposure to an infected patient in the general ward of a hospital (1, 32). Overall, SARS-CoV infected 8,098 people and caused 774 fatalities in 29 different countries by the end of the epidemic (1). Later, during June 2012, a patient infected by MERS-CoV developed severe pneumonia and died in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (1, 33). Analysis of cluster of nosocomial cases in Jordan during April 2012 confirmed that MERS-CoV caused the outbreak (34). The spread of MERS-CoV continued beyond the Middle East, causing further reports of infected individuals (1, 4). Until 2020, 2,468 cases and 851 fatalities had been reported globally (35, 36). During December 2019, clusters of patients with atypical pneumonia were reported by local health facilities in Wuhan, China. On December 31, 2019, a rapid response team was dispatched by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) to conduct an epidemiologic and etiologic investigation (37). The patients were found epidemiologically linked to the wet animal wholesale seafood market in Wuhan, China. Later, the infectious agent responsible for this atypical pneumonia was confirmed and reported as coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which caused the first fatality in early January 2020 (15). During the first 6 weeks of the outbreak, several cases were reported in more than 37 countries, including the USA, Japan, Iran, and South Korea (38). The infection rapidly spread across the globe from Wuhan, China. Therefore, the Chinese authorities implemented several strategies, including massive lockdown in Wuhan and suspension of transport to and from Wuhan to control the spread (17). According to Situation Report 35, published on the WHO website, SARS-CoV-2 caused 79,331 confirmed cases and 2,618 deaths around the globe. However, COVID-19 caused 77,262 confirmed cases and 2,595 deaths inside mainland China alone (38). Through February 24, WHO had reported 8 deaths in Iran. It is now the second country after China, bearing the highest fatalities due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. (38). The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Iran poses a higher risk of pandemics in the Middle East and South Asian countries. Between December 10 and January 4, analysis of the growth rate of the epidemic gave a basic reproductive number (R0) of 2.2, meaning each patient has been spreading the infection to 2.2 other individuals (39). The estimated R0 value for SARS was around 3, however, SARS was successfully controlled by isolation of patients (39). Moreover, the R0 for MERS ranged from 0.45 in Saudi Arabia to 8.1 in South Korea (36). Considering the lower R0 value, the rapid increase in suspected as well confirmed cases of COVID-19 may be inferred via viral transmission through the fecal-oral route and aerosol formation. Moreover, asymptomatic persons are thought to be potential sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection (40), which may have caused the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. This asymptomatic spread may be one reason that the control strategy based on the isolation of patients has not been fully successful. To overcome these problems, a complete quarantine is necessary, allowing all of the infected individuals to develop symptoms without spreading the virus randomly. Thus, the direct and indirect contacts of infected individuals can be easily identified and isolated.",

Delays in testing result from the need for administrative oversight of testing at the national or regional level, as well as the time needed to transport specimens and the high volume of testing needed in some regions. More rapid testing should be widely available in the event of epidemics. High-level testing facilities at regional hospitals and commercial laboratories are needed, in addition to the commercially available tests that have undergone regulatory approval. Several tests have been validated by public health authorities, including those in China, Germany, Thailand, Japan, and the United States (WHO, COVID-19, technical guidance, Feb 12, 2020). These tests are reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) tests that use primers and probes designed to detect a variety of targets in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Although these have been designed and validated, there is currently very limited information available related to the performance of these tests. The sensitivity and specificity of the tests are not widely known, and some of them might detect other related coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV. In addition, the utility of different specimen types for detection of the viruses is not known. As a result, testing of multiple specimen types is recommended by some agencies, including the CDC (42). The availability of serological tests is unclear and, presumably, such tests are in development. Moreover, the collection and submission of sera from potentially infected patients is recommended by some public health laboratories.",

            "text": "Currently there are no promising antiviral treatments available, however, numerous compounds have been proven effective against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV but have not been tested widely for the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir and chloroquine were found highly effective in vitro for the control of 2019-nCoV infection (44). Treatment with remdesivir alone or in combination with chloroquine or interferon beta was found effective against COVID-19 infection. This strategy has not caused any obvious side effects yet (35, 44, 45). However, more investigations are necessary to confirm the impacts of remdesivir. As coronaviruses share key genomic elements, common therapeutic targets are likely to be of greater importance. Therapeutic agents targeting nucleosides, nucleotides, viral nucleic acids, and enzymes/proteins involved in the replication and transcription of coronaviruses can be promising strategies to treat coronavirus diseases (Table 1) (1). The surface spike glycoprotein (S) is an important potential target for antiviral agents, due to its vital role in the interaction between the virus and the cell receptor. S consists of two subunits: S1, the amino-terminal receptor binding subunit, and S2, the carboxy-terminal membrane fusion subunit (46). In addition, activation of membrane fusion and virus entry requires the cleavage at the junction of S1-S2 (46). Hence, S1 subunit-targeting monoclonal antibodies and S2 subunit-targeting fusion inhibitors may be effective therapeutic agents for coronaviruses (1). Furin (a serine endoprotease) cleaves off S1/S2 (47) could thus be a suitable antiviral agent. Further, the helical nucleocapsid interacts with S protein, envelope proteins, and membrane proteins to form the assembled virion (1). Therefore, targeting the structural genes using small interfering RNAs could be an effective therapeutic strategy against coronaviruses (1). The host receptors are also associated with the viral entry into host cells, thus agents targeting these receptors also inhibit coronaviruses (46). Inhibitors of endosomal cysteine protease and transmembrane protease serine 2 can partially block viral entry into the cell (48). K22 targets membrane-bound RNA synthesis in coronaviruses and inhibits double-membrane vesicle formation (49), and thus could be effective against SARS-CoV-2.",

However, this class does not provide a promising strategy alone, as they cannot block virus entry or disrupt viral nucleic acid. In contrast, thiopurine compounds, naphthalene inhibitors, protease inhibitors, zinc, and mercury conjugates target 3CLpro (3C-like protease) and PLpro (papain-like protease) enzymes in coronaviruses and have been shown to block their pathogenicity (51, 52). Therefore, combinational therapy of these antiviral agents with DRACO may enhance the overall impact on the recovery of patients. Despite the higher rate of infectiousness, coronaviruses are thought to have the ability to suppress counteracting responses from host innate interferons. This response can be augmented by the utilization of interferon inducers or recombinant interferons (1). Recombinant interferons such as interferon alpha and interferon beta that have been tested against SARS-CoV (1) might be utilized either alone or in combination with other potential antiviral drugs, including remdesivir. Both interferon alpha and beta inhibit viral replication (1). The use of interferon inducers in combination with effective antiviral agents is worth evaluating for possible synergistic effects against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporine (53), in combination with antibiotics and traditional Chinese medicines, could also be evaluated for activity against SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Effective vaccines are important to prevent and control sporadic viral attacks and emerging virus-mediated epidemics, such as the recent outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2. Although SARS-CoV was fully controlled during 2003, and MERS-CoV has been prevented from causing high mortality rates, the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is spreading efficiently with a significant increase in the number of cases and fatalities during each passing day. Vaccines are required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from causing COVID-19. Live-attenuated vaccines, such as has been designed for SARS (1), may be evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. In addition rhesus \u03b8-defensin 1 and protein cage nanoparticles are innate immunomodulators with high anti-SARS-CoV efficiency (54, 55). Based on the high similarity and phylogenetic relatedness between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, protein cage nanoparticles designed for SARS-CoV can be evaluated for SARS-CoV-2. Meanwhile, following similar strategies utilized for SARS-CoV, novel protein cage nanoparticles specified for novel coronavirus can be designed on an emergency basis. Given the urgency in the current scenario of COVID-19 outbreak, vaccination strategies based on viral vectors, recombinant protein, and viral-like particles, which have been developed or are being developed for SARS and/or MERS, could be modified for utilization against SARS-CoV-2 (56). Despite the current progress, further work is needed to develop safe and effective vaccines, available for individuals at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 endemics, to control the ongoing and risk of future epidemics. Further, an interesting feature of plasma from recovered patients is the presence of active antibodies. The transfer of plasma from people who have recovered from COVID-19 into infected individuals might enhance immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Monoclonal antibodies that could inhibit virus-cell receptor binding and interrupt virus-cell fusion have been developed (1).

Lastly, antiviral peptides that target different regions of S, such as HP2P-M2 peptide (effective against viral infections) (1), should also be considered against COVID-19.",

Similarly, MERS-CoV became epidemic after a series of human infections in 2012 in Middle Eastern countries (33). Both viruses transferred to several countries beyond the countries of origin. However, unlike the continuous propagation of the MERS-CoV epidemic, the SARS-CoV outbreak was successfully controlled in 2003. Based on the origin of other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is likely to have originated in bats and have been introduced to Wuhan, China through an unknown intermediate. Until now, no effective clinical treatments or prevention strategies are available to be used against human coronaviruses.",

The currently established models are not very promising for the studies of pathogenesis and treatment of highly pathogenic coronaviruses. For instance, nonhuman primates were unable to reproduce the characteristics of the severe human disease and mortality was not observed (57). However, some small animals have developed clinical symptoms of disease (57), such as transgenic mice expressing human ACE2, and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV strains are one of the most suitable models (1). Additionally, transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 are a suitable small animal model for MERS (1). Like the animal models for SARS-CoV, transgenic animal models may also be standardized for SARS-CoV-2. The development of clinical drugs for coronaviruses is challenging because of the repeated emergence of novel coronaviruses with diverse features, thus requiring specific drugs for each newly emerged virus. Moreover, only a limited number of animal models are available and most of them can only be used in highly demanding biosafety level 3 labs (1). From the perspective of the current outbreak, designing effective therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 is yet another challenge for scientists. Although a large number of antiviral treatment options for SARS and MERS have been reported with potent in vitro activities, a very limited number of these may have potential in the clinical setting.",
