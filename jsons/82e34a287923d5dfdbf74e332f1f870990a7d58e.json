Though children are at comparatively lower risk compared to adults, the Indian population has a large young demographic that is likely to be at higher risk due to exposure to pollution, malnutrition and poor access to medical care. We aimed to quantify the : medRxiv preprint Conclusion: These estimates show COVID-19 has the potential to pose a substantial threat to India's large population of children, particularly those suffering from malnutrition and exposure to indoor air pollution, who may have limited access to health services.",

Of those, 12.3% of children tested positive with a median age of infection of 6.7 years [12] . Of 2,143 Chinese pediatric COVID-19 patients, only one child died and most cases were mild, with much fewer severe and critical cases (5.9%) than adult patients (18.5%) [13] . Of 22,512 people in Italy with COVID-19, there were 1,625 deaths but none of these were in people younger than 30 years [14] . The fact that 15% of children overall were asymptomatic in China and had no radiological findings suggests many children could be asymptomatic carriers of the novel coronavirus [12] . According to our calculations, even in the scenario with the lowest prevalence rate of 0.1%, the total number of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 under the age of 5 was 87,200, and in the high prevalence scenario of 5% this reached 872,200 in the 18 most populous Indian states alone.",

Approximately 50% of children infected with COVID-19 exhibit high fever and/or cough with fever subsiding within three days [18] . Myalgia, lethargy, and gastrointestinal symptoms have also been reported. Only one death was reported in this period of a 14 year-old boy. Infants were particularly vulnerable to infection with 10.6% of severe and critical cases being under the age of one [13] . Children of all ages were susceptible with no significant difference between genders. 5.9% of child cases were severe or critical, in contrast to 18.5% of adult cases [13] . However, in the Indian context, given its large young population, 31,900 hospitalized cases in the low prevalence scenario, or 319,700 hospitalized cases in the high prevalence scenario would present a severe burden to the health system if these cases were to arise around the same point in time. An inundated healthcare service would be less able to provide quality care and this could cause mortality rates to increase. In conclusion, COVID-19 poses a rapidly emerging threat, not only to the most publicized at-risk groups; the elderly and immunocompromised, but also to younger age groups. India has a large population of children, many of whom do not have access to essential health services or are vulnerable to respiratory pathogens due to pollution-induced lung damage and malnutrition. In addition, the simple estimates presented here are unable to take into account the further impact of the reduction in services offered by an overburdened health system on children suffering from health issues other than COVID-19. Many children stand to be affected by the coming pandemic and it is essential that India prepares for this eventuality or the lives of the next generation will be put at risk.",

            "text": "Much of the data on the impact of COVID-19 on pediatric populations comes from the original epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, China. However, many schools were closed for the Spring Festival Holiday at this time, potentially reducing the transmission of the virus in children [19]. In early January, among 366 children (\u226416 years of age) hospitalized with respiratory illness at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, 23 had influenza A virus, 20 had influenza B virus and 6 patients were infected with COVID-19 [20]. All 6 recovered with only one being admitted to ICU and receiving pooled immune globulin. COVID-19 patients were treated empirically with antiviral agents, antibiotic agents, and supportive therapies and their recovery time was between 5 and 13 days. However, it is hard to predict the recovery trajectory these patients would have seen without access to this high level of care. Many in India cannot afford access to medical year and 661 COVID-19 patients at one hospital in China between Jan 17 and March 1, 36 (5%) were children (1-16 years of age) [19]. Pediatric patients acquired COVID-19 either through close contact with infected family members (89%), exposure to endemic areas (33%), or both (22%). In India, families often cohabit between multiple generations and though government mandated social distancing attempts to reduce transmission many indians have no option but to share a small co-living space. The majority (53%) of pediatric patients showed moderate symptoms and none of the cases were severe or critical. Though symptoms of COVID-19 areoften mild in children, the prevalence of pneumonia with COVID-19 (53%) in this study was higher than H1N1 influenza (11%), and similar to SARS (65%)[19].",
