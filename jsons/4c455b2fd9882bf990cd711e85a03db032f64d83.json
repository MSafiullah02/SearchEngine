The 21st century appears no longer an exception, with the trend continued with escalated fear of SARS coronavirus in 2002 and further concern of influenza H5N1 in 2003. A novel influenza virus created the first pandemic of the 21st century, the pandemic flu in 2009 preceded with the emergence of another deadly virus, MERS-CoV in 2012. A novel coronavirus \"SARS-CoV-2\" (and the disease COVID-19) emerged suddenly, causing a rapid outbreak with a moderate case fatality rate. This virus is continuing to cause health care providers grave concern due to the lack of any existing immunity in the human population, indicating their novelty and lack of previous exposure. The big question is whether this novel virus will be establishing itself in an endemic form or will it eventually die out? Endemic viruses during circulation may acquire mutations to infect na\u00efve, as well as individual with pre-existing immunity. Continuous monitoring is strongly advisable, not only to the newly infected individuals, but also to those recovered individuals who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 as re-infection may lead to the selection of escape mutants and subsequent dissemination to the population.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "ARTICLE HISTORY", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Towards the end of the first decade of the 21st century, during December 2019, numerous pneumonia incidences of unidentified cause appeared in Wuhan, Hubei, China, with clinical presentations greatly resembling Flu and viral pneumonia. After virus isolation and analysis of viral genome sequence from infected patient's samples, a novel coronavirus named as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 (initially designated as novel coronavirus or nCoV-2019) was identified from an unknown source. SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of respiratory disease which is recently named as Coronavirus disease 2019 by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a major concern for the health care workers and a preliminary R0 (Reproductive number: as the number of new infection one infected person generates on average throughout its infectious period) measure of 1.4-2.5 was reported by the WHO (https://www.who.int/healthtopics/coronavirus). Since its appearance within a months' time enormous number of new cases are piling up and the actual R0 value may be quite higher than previously calculated . Epidemiological data suggest that approximately (as of February 29 2020) 79,251 people infected with this virus in mainland China and multiple cases also reported from other parts of the world (https://who.sprinklr.com;https://www. medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/publichealth/ 84698). So far 60 other countries reported SARS-CoV-2 infection; although most of the cases are migrants of China, indicating a single introduction of this virus. Among the other countries, South Korea (3,150 cases), Italy (889 cases), Japan (234 cases), Iran (388 cases), Singapore (96 cases), HongKong (94 cases) and USA (64 cases) reported significant number of cases and the situation is getting complicated with time. Current findings indicate that various subtypes of coronaviruses are in circulation within the bat population including other species such as birds, cats, dogs, pigs, mice, horses, whales before they acquire the ability to cross the species barriers to cause human infection. It is still unanswered that how SARS-CoV-2 has caused an outbreak in Wuhan. The initial wave of infection found associated with the seafood market of Wuhan, strengthening the hypothesis that close contact between the live or dead animal with an individual may be responsible for the initiation of the outbreak. In the recent past there are examples of zoonotic transmission of bird flu which directly jumped from avian species to human, but no transmission between the humans were established which kept the disease under control. However, the ability to spread among human to human upon close contact makes SARS-CoV-2 as a very important contagious agent to study and monitor whose devastation has already been established in Wuhan, Hubei, China.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "COVID-19 is one of the most alarming diseases in the globe at this moment.

Virus faces major challenges from pre-existing immunity to remain in the population. Other important factors such as case fatality rate (CFR), R0 and the reservoir hosts are crucial in influencing viral endemicity. By analysing CFR of different RNA viruses and their longevity in circulation throughout the globe, it was found that viruses with higher CFR (CFR >5%) die out after few passages of infections sooner or later, whereas viruses with low CFR remain endemic with a seasonal outbreak like common flu caused by influenza viruses (Figure 1 ). Although it is very difficult to calculate actual CFR until the outbreak ends, an initial estimate suggests that CFR for SARS-CoV-2 is 2.58%, much closer to seasonal flu than the other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERs-CoV) of the recent past (i.e. 10% and 35%, respectively, https:// www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/) indicating the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 to remain in circulation with Figure 1 . Relationship between high and low CFR virus infection and outbreak outcome. When viruses with low CFR infect an individual, gradually, it induces the host immune system. The induced immunity may enable the spread of mutant viruses in the population, whereas viruses with high CFR causes robust infection and rapid immune responses leading to death. Imprisonment of the different viral species within the dead host will lead to a reduction in the diverse or mutant virus population in the circulation result the outbreak to its conclusion. low CFR throughout the world.

The primary wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection is under progress at present. The majority of the exposed population will acquire some immunity eventually and the real hurdles for the viruses to defeat or bypass existing immunity will reflect with the acquired mutations within the virus in future. To defeat host immunity, viruses must mutate without losing their infectivity. So far there are no published data regarding infection ability of SARS-CoV-2 and their mutation potential under robust immunological selection pressure within the host. Previous data from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected individuals indicated that antibody response tends to be short-lived but remain longer depending on the severity of the infection. T cell responses often target highly conserved internal proteins and are long-lived (Channappanavar et al. 2014; Alshukairi et al. 2016 ). SARS-CoV-specific memory T cells but not memory B cells or antibody could be detected six years after infection in SARS survivors (Tang et al 2011) .

We have compared the ACE2 gene from avian species and the data suggest conservation of amino acids of ACE2 protein within most of the birds Figure 5 . Viral selection during an outbreak. Host induces immune response when infected by the virus, which can protect the individual from the same virus but not from the mutated one. Reservoir host allows the virus to replicate and mutate, leading to an expansion in viral diversity with altered antigenicity within the viral pool. The antigenically mutated virus can be selected when it infects a host with pre-existing immunity towards the earlier strain. This will allow the selection of mutated viruses within a host and dissemination if the mutant virus remains contagious.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 598, "end": 617, "text": "(Bailey et al. 2018", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 995, "end": 1003, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Reservoir for SARS-CoV-2"}, {"text": "(data not shown).

Moreover, there is no experimental proof for betacoronavirus (like SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) infection in the birds; although a recent study has shown the significant presence of alpha and gammacoronaviruses in ducks, shorebirds, and herons in Australia (Chamings et al. 2018) . These observations allow us to believe that the birds are less prone to betacoronavirus infection or the least chance of bird infection from betacoronaviruses. Significantly, the bird poses alpha and gammacoronaviruses that are incompetent to infect a human. Hence, the risks of spread of the SARS-CoV-2 through bird to human are very unlikely at its present form. Qinghai Lake in China is one of the biggest breeding sites for different migratory bird species.

Phylogenetic analysis based on the spike gene nucleotide sequence performed in this study has shown that all the SARS-CoV-2 sequences are forming a single cluster without any branching indicating SARS-CoV-2 conservation throughout this ongoing outbreak. Earlier studies have shown that spike protein was a target of a robust humoral immune response in case of SARS or MERS viral infection. These findings advocate that virus that caused the initial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is still in circulation without any major changes. Very little or absence of pre-existing immunity in the community or selection pressure within the population probably allowed SARS-CoV-2 to remain in circulation in its original form.

We must look at the conservation among different epitopes in immune selected strains while choosing the right vaccine candidates.

In case of pandemic 1918 influenza infection, three waves of infection killed more than 50 million worldwide in two years, where the second wave was the most devastating. The first wave of the 1918 flu pandemic flu had resembled common flu epidemics; people most at risk were the weak and elderly, while younger, healthier people recovered easily apparently resembling COVID-19 in its present form.
