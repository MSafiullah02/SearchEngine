Little did we at UW Medicine know that Seattle-King County, where our health system is based, would become an early epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in the United States. After the first patient with coronavirus disease 2019 in the United States was diagnosed in Washington State on January 19, 2020, local public health jurisdictions partnered with UW Medicine leaders in infection prevention and control to rapidly implement containment strategies including creative models of care, such as the home assessment team that deploys physician and nurse teams to patients' places of residence, to evaluate and test for SARS-CoV-2. 1 In the weeks that followed, it was not clear how prevalent the virus was in our community. The first priority for our infection prevention and control team and for the larger public health efforts was to limit the movement of patients at high risk of infection (based on travel or contact history) into crowded emergency departments and busy clinics. The first reported death in the United States was of a Washington State patient with SARS-CoV-2 on February 29, 2020; it coincided with reports of COVID-19 cases in several residents and staff at a skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility in Seattle-King County. These events led to rapid mobilization and collaboration among our state, public health, and regional health care systems to support our community through the ensuing pandemic.",

On February 29, 2020, a patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) passed away in a hospital in Seattle-King County, the first reported COVID-19-related death in the United States.

Tapping into the multipronged mission areas of academic medicine, UW Medicine worked to support the community, innovate in science and clinical practice; lead policy and practice guideline development; and adopt changes as the crisis unfolded. In doing so, health system leaders had to balance their commitments to students, residents and fellows, researchers, faculty, staff, and hospital and health center entities, while ensuring that patients continued to receive cutting-edge, high-quality, safe care.

We quickly expanded the capacity of our virtual and telemedicine care teams, developing specific protocols for critical care and immunosuppressed and highrisk patients coming to our health care system for complex procedures. These guidelines were written by multiple care partners across UW Medicine, going quickly through the initial draft, revisions, and approval processes and being posted on a central internal UW Medicine website for immediate use. User feedback and subsequent changes are ongoing, and the website is updated in real time as policy and practice recommendations evolve. In keeping with the core mission of our academic health system being a resource for the community hospitals and health facilities in our county and state (and beyond), we also created a public website to facilitate external access to our guidelines and protocols (see the UW Medicine COVID-19 Resource Site at covid-19.uwmedicine.org).",

In collaboration with public health authorities (through state and federal labs), this test also significantly increased our regional capacity to test at-risk populations. In early March, the Virology Division lab was able to process dozens of specimens per day, which quickly ramped up to more than 2,000 specimens per day with the addition of high-throughput equipment. Within 2 weeks of offering testing services to the state, 85% of the processed specimens came from outside the UW Medicine health system. UW Medicine also set up multiple drivethrough COVID-19 testing sites to offer an alternative approach to testing patients for SARS-CoV-2. Staff wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) obtain specimens from patients who remain in their cars, allowing for an innovative approach to providing patient-centered care, while preserving PPE and diverting potentially infectious patients from our clinics, urgent care facilities, and emergency departments.",

For example, one of our early challenges was the conflict between the precaution and PPE guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) and those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. UW Medicine worked with the Washington State Department of Health, the Northwest Healthcare Response Network, and the Washington State Hospital Association to lead the change to adopt the WHO guidelines using standard, droplet, and contact precautions (i.e., mask, eye protection, gown, and gloves) for the care of suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19, while reserving airborne precautions for caring for patients undergoing aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., intubation). This change was based on the biology of SARS-CoV-2 indicating that the virus spread predominantly through large respiratory droplets similar to other respiratory viruses and on our desire to match the appropriate level of PPE with the care provided. This decision was critical to ensuring adequate supplies of N95 respirators for use in the care of critically ill patients or those undergoing aerosolgenerating procedures.",

We quickly adjusted to better coordinate our supplies, including moving all available PPE from nonclinical spaces (e.g., the School of Medicine research and simulation labs) to the hospitals and clinics. Rapid depletion of PPE forced difficult conversations across the UW Medicine system about the sustainability of current practices and led to PPE conservation strategies, such as limiting the number of individuals entering hospital rooms on rounds, transferring medical students from their clinical rotations, and postponing elective and nonurgent surgeries and procedures if they could be safely delayed without causing patient harm.",

Early on, residents and fellows were excluded from the care of COVID-19 patients. However, as the number of infected patients exponentially increased, residents and fellows were asked to care for these patients in a phased manner, while maintaining the principles of PPE preservation and minimizing the number of provider exposures to patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. If our county or state should be asked to provide crisis standards of care, 2 residents and fellows may be called upon to provide more independent care of patients, with a greater number of trainees under the supervision of a single faculty member. Our health system leaders are already working with regional and state-wide leaders to determine the appropriate allocation and utilization of scarce resources and clinical services available to our community.",

That quickly evolved to include any patient whose care required the use of PPE, including in operating rooms (with one exception made for subintern students who were on a surgical rotation as a key part of their career planning). This very restrictive policy was soon followed by a School of Medicine decision to suspend students' clinical rotations until the end of April, when the policy will be reassessed.",
