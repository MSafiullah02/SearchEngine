This test is routinely employed for the detection of viruses responsible for respiratory illnesses [17]. In the RT-PCR technique, viral isolates are used as a primary substrate to perform an assay that identifies a specific virus and its gene sequence [18]. A CT scan is considered more sensitive than RT-PCR, and can be used to confirm a positive RT-PCR test [19]. To conduct RT-PCR, a sample taken from throat swabs, urine, saliva or stool can be used. Usually the nucleic acid test is repeated for a single patient in order to get accurate results. Two tests are performed successively at a gap of 24 h when the virus is not observed in the throat swab sample. If RT-PCR is not available, a serological test could also be use for diagnostic examination [15].",
