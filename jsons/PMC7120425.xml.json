The Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) can be identified by a multitude of experimental methods. However, a vast majority of the PPIs available today are generated by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) method and affinity purification or co-fractionation coupled to mass spectrometry (AP-MS) (Kerrien et al. 2012). It is important to note that these methods yield different types of information; Y2H analyses reveal binary interactions, including transient interactions, whereas the AP-MS approaches report multiple interactions connecting all of the proteins in fairly stable complexes. Protein interactome analysis on a genome scale was first achieved by using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens (Ito et al. 2001; Uetz et al. 2000) and next by large-scale mass spectrometric analysis of affinity-purified protein complexes (Gavin et al. 2002; Ho et al. 2002). Here we describe the high-throughput Y2H screening strategies, applied to map high-quality proteome-scale interactome networks of model organisms and pathogenic infectious agents.",

            "text": "The Y2H system is a genetic screening extensively used to identify binary protein\u2013protein interactions in vivo (in yeast cells). The system was originally developed by Stanley Fields in 1989 (Fields and Song 1989). The principle of the assay relied on major discoveries on transcription initiation (Brent and Ptashne 1985). In general the protein domains can be separated and recombined and can retain their properties. In particular, transcription factors can frequently be split into the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and activation domains (ADs). In the two-hybrid system, a DNA-binding domain (in this case, from the yeast Gal4 protein) is fused to a protein generally called bait (\u201cB\u201d) for which one wants to find interacting partners. A transcriptional activation domain (from the yeast Gal4 protein) is then fused to one or more ORFs (preys) (Fig. 11.1). The bait and prey fusion proteins are then co-expressed in the same yeast cell. If, the two proteins bait and prey interact, a transcription factor is reconstituted which in turn activates the reporter gene(s) (Fig. 11.1). The expression of the reporter gene allows the yeast cell to grow under certain conditions. For example, the HIS3 reporter encodes imidazoleglycerolphosphate (IGP) dehydratase, a critical enzyme in histidine biosynthesis. In a screening yeast strain lacking an endogenous copy of HIS3, expression of a HIS3 reporter gene is driven by a promoter that contains a Gal4p-binding site, so the bait protein fusion can bind to it. However, the bait fusion does not contain a transcriptional activation domain it remains inactive. If, a prey protein with an attached activation domain binds to the bait protein, this activation domain can recruit the basal transcription machinery, and expression of the reporter gene ensues. Thus, these cells can now grow in the absence of histidine in the media because they can synthesize their own. \n",

            "text": "Initially, the two-hybrid system was invented to demonstrate the association of two proteins (Fields and Song 1989). Later, it was demonstrated that completely new protein interactions can be identified with this system. Over time, it has become clear that the ability to perform unbiased large-scale library screens is the most powerful application of the system. In recent years, Y2H method has been extensively applied to map high-quality proteome-scale binary interactome networks of server model organism, including human proteome and may pathogenic infectious agents. In a recent study, Rolland et al., published a human interactome map, which is based on a systematic Y2H screening of 13,000 human proteins that uncovered 14,000 PPIs (Rolland et al. 2014). Similarly, several large-scale Y2H projects have been successful in systematically mapping binary interactome landscape of Escherichia coli (Rajagopala et al. 2014), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Uetz et al. 2000; Yu et al. 2008), Caenorhabditis elegans (Gong et al. 2004), Drosophila melanogaster (Giot et al. 2003); these studies have shown that most of the proteins in a cell are actually connected to each other. The Y2H screening has also been implemented on many pathogenic infectious agents, to name a few, the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (Uetz et al. 2006), varicella-zoster (Uetz et al. 2006; Stellberger et al. 2010), Epstein\u2013Barr (Calderwood et al. 2007), SARS (von Brunn et al. 2007), influenza (Shapira et al. 2009) viruses, the Campylobacter jejuni (Parrish et al. 2007), Helicobacter pylori (Hauser et al. 2014; Rain et al. 2001) and Treponema pallidum (Titz et al. 2008) bacteria, and Trypanosoma brucei (Lacomble et al. 2009) parasite. These interactome maps enhance our knowledge on these infectious agents and suggest potential therapeutic targets. Another potential of the Y2H method is to map host\u2013pathogen protein interactions, which has been achieved for Epstein\u2013Barr (Calderwood et al. 2007), hepatitis C (de Chassey et al. 2008), influenza (Shapira et al. 2009) and dengue (Khadka et al. 2011) viruses as well as mapping the interactions of bacterial effectors proteins with the it\u2019s host (Memisevic et al. 2013). These studies have the potential to both fundamentally change our understanding of how pathogens (virus/bacteria) modulate the host proteome and aid the development of countermeasures to control infections/diseases. Likewise, the two-hybrid screens, can also be adapted to a variety of related questions, such as the identification of mutants that avert or advance interactions (Schwartz et al. 1998; Wang et al. 2012), the screening for drugs that affect protein interactions (Vidal and Endoh 1999; Vidal and Legrain 1999), the identification of RNA-binding proteins (SenGupta et al. 1996), or the semiquantitative determination of binding affinities (Estojak et al. 1995). The system can also be exploited to map binding domains (Rain et al. 2001; Ester and Uetz 2008), to study protein folding (Raquet et al. 2001), or to map interactions within a protein complex, for example, spliceosome (Hegele et al. 2012), proteasome (Cagney et al. 2001), flagellum (Rajagopala et al. 2007).",

Typically the bait protein is expressed in one haploid yeast strain and the prey is expressed in another haploid yeast strain of different mating type (Fig. 11.1). The two strains are then mated so that the two proteins are expressed in the resulting diploid cell (Fig. 11.2). The screenings are done side-by-side under identical conditions with several prey proteins, and negative controls, so they can be well controlled, i.e., compared with control assays. In an array, usually each element (prey) is sequence validated and therefore it is immediately clear which two proteins are interacting when positives are selected. Most importantly, all the assays are done in an ordered array, so that background signals can be easily distinguished from true signals (Fig. 11.2, step 3). However, to perform the array screens the prey library need to be made upfront. This can be done for a subset of genes or for a whole genome (i.e., all ORFs of a genome). The array-based Y2H screenings are ideal for small genomes, for example mapping the interactions of phages (Rajagopala et al. 2011), virus (Uetz et al. 2006; Shapira et al. 2009; Khadka et al. 2011) and mapping the interactions within a protein complex (Rajagopala et al. 2007, 2012). Hands-on time and the amount of used resources grow exponentially with the number of tested proteins; this is a disadvantage for large genome sizes. However, cloned ORFeome collections of whole genomes become increasingly available for several organisms and modern cloning systems also allow direct transfer of entry clones into many specialized vectors (Walhout et al. 2000). One of the first applications of such clone collections is often a high-throughput protein interaction screening. \n",

In the pooled array screening, preys of known identity (systematically cloned or sequenced cDNA library clones) are combined and tested as pools against bait strains. The identification of the interacting protein pair commonly requires either sequencing preys in the positive yeast colonies or retesting of all members of the respective pool clones. Prof. Vidal lab at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston MA, employed a pooling strategy for several large-scale interactome mapping projects (Rolland et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2008; Rual et al. 2005). Often, they tested each bait against pools of \u223c188 preys (mini-libraries) and the identity of the interacting prey in the mini-libraries was identified by sequencing the prey PCR amplicons by end-read sequencing (Rual et al. 2005), or \u2018stitched\u2019 the interacting bait and preys together into a single amplicon and sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology (Rolland et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2008, 2011). Stelzl et al. tested pools of 8 baits against a systematic library of individual preys and identified interactions by a 2nd interaction mating (Stelzl et al. 2005). Likewise, Jin et al. proposed an \u201csmart-pool-array\u201d system, which allows the deconvolution of the interacting pairs through the definition of overlapping bait pools (Jin et al. 2007), and thus usually does not depend on sequencing or a 2nd pairwise retest procedure. Preferably, the preys are pooled rather than baits, because the former do not generally result in self-activation of transcription.",

Previous yeast two-hybrid and bacterial two-hybrid screening projects used random genomic DNA libraries (Rain et al. 2001; Joung et al. 2000). A cDNA library is made through reverse transcription of mRNA collected from specific cell types or whole organisms. To simplify the task even more, many cDNA libraries are commercially available.

Even for the well-studied bacterium E. coli, more than 50 % of the interactome remains to be mapped (Rajagopala et al. 2014). An impotent step for high-throughput interactome-mapping methods using Y2H is determining the identities of the interacting proteins. Adapting the next-generation DNA sequencing technologies (Bennett et al. 2005; Margulies et al. 2005) as opposed to Sanger technology, would substantially increase throughput and decrease cost. However, next-generation DNA sequencing technologies are not readily applicable for identification of interacting pairs. Yu et al. describe a massively parallel interactome-mapping strategy that incorporates next-generation DNA sequencing and test the strategy in a high-throughput Y2H system (Yu et al. 2011). The methodology, termed Stitch-seq, which used PCR approach to amplify and stitch the bait and prey ORF or cDNA inserts in to a single amplican. Then the PCR products are pooled and sequenced by next-generation DNA sequencing to produce stitched interacting sequence tags. The sequencing produced an average read length of 207 bases, which are 125 bases longer than the 82-bp linker sequence between bait and preys. To identify the ORFs encoding pairs of interacting proteins, they selected reads that contained the linker sequence and also covered at least 15 bases of ORF-specific sequences on both ends of the linker. These reads could unambiguously identify pairs of unique bait and prey ORFs, after matching these sequences to human ORFeome collection used for the study. This general scheme can be readily extended to increase throughput and decrease cost for other interactome-mapping methods, particularly for binary protein-protein interaction assays",

            "text": "Analysis of raw results significantly improves the data quality of the protein interaction set. It is important to consider at least the following three parameters to obtain a high-quality Y2H data. Auto-activation: Is the background self-activation strength of the tested bait. The protein interaction strength of interacting pairs must be significantly higher than with all other (background) pairs. Ideally, no activation (i.e. no colony growth) should be observed in non-interacting pairs or vector control. Reproducibility: The protein interactions that are not reproduced in a pairwise retest experiment should be discarded. Sticky preys: For each prey the number of different interacting baits (prey count) is counted; preys interacting with a large number of baits are non-specific (\u201csticky\u201d preys) and thus may have no biological relevance. The cut-off number depends also on the nature of baits and the number of baits screened: if a large family of related proteins are screened it is expected that many of them find the same prey. As a general guideline the number of baits interacting with a certain prey should not be larger than 5\u201310 % of the bait number, in an unbiased set of baits or genome-wide screenings. Furthermore, more sophisticated statistical evaluations of the raw can be adapted, i.e., using logistic regression approach that uses statistical and topological descriptors to predict the biological relevance of protein-protein interactions obtained from high-throughput screens as well as integrating known and predicted interactions from a variety of sources (Bader et al. 2004; von Mering et al. 2007).",

            "text": "Although Y2H screens have been among the most powerful methods to detect binary protein-protein interactions, a limitation of the technology is the high incidence of false negative interactions (true interactions that are not detected) which is on the order of 70\u201390 % (Rajagopala et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2008). The interactome studies that have implemented proteome-scale Y2H screening in E. coli and yeast are shown to have identified 20\u201325 % of the PPIs (Rajagopala et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2008). In a previous studies, Rajagopala et al, have investigated underlying causes for this high degree of false negatives and uncovered that the structural constrains and expression levels of recombinant proteins play a major role (Rajagopala et al. 2009). Traditionally, Y2H screens have been performed using N-terminal fusion proteins of DNA-binding and activation domains. To mitigate the structural constrains Stellberger et al. constructed two new vectors that allows to make both C-terminal fusion proteins of DNA-binding and activation domains and showed that permutations of C- and N-terminal Y2H vectors detect different subsets of interactions (Stellberger et al. 2010). A study by Chen et al. benchmarked several variants of two-hybrid vectors (i.e., pGBGT7g-pGADCg, pGBGT7g-pGADT7g, pDEST32-pDEST22, pGBKCg-pGADT7g and pGBKCg-pGADCg) using a human positive reference set and a random reference set of protein-protein interaction pairs (Braun et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2010). In addition to each vector pair, they tested each protein both as activation (prey) and DNA-binding domain fusion (bait), including C-terminal fusions in pGBKCg and pGADCg. This way, they tested each protein pair in ten different configurations (Chen et al. 2010). This study clearly demonstrates that different Y2H variants (multiple-variants) detect markedly different subsets of interactions in the same interactome. All ten different configurations of bait-prey fusions were required to detect 73 of 92 interactions (79.3 %), whereas individual vector pairs detected only 23.3 out of 92 interactions (25.3 %) on average (Chen et al. 2010). Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate the general effectiveness of the multiple-variants of Y2H system in detecting true direct binary interactions and topology among the protein complex subunits (Rajagopala et al. 2012). Having multiple-variants of Y2H vectors that detect different subsets of interactions will be of great value to generate more comprehensive protein interactions data set, thus future interactome projects must adopt multiple Y2H vector systems with proper controls and adequate stringency.",

A \u201ctechnical\u201d false positive is an apparent two-hybrid interaction that is not based on the assembly of two hybrid proteins (that is, the reporter gene(s) gets activated without a protein\u2013protein interaction between bait and prey). Frequently, such false positives are associated with bait proteins that act as transcriptional activators. Some bait or prey proteins may affect general colony viability and hence enhance the ability of a cell to grow under selective conditions and activate the reporter gene. Mutations or other random events of unknown nature may be invoked as potential explanations as well. A number of procedures have been developed to identify or avoid false positives, including the utilization of multiple reporters, independent methods of specificity testing, or simply retesting the interactions in a pairwise Y2H assays to make sure that the interaction is reproducible (Rajagopala et al. 2014; Yu et al. 2008; Koegl and Uetz 2007).",

Those include the partners that can physically interact but that are never in close proximity to one another in the cell because of distinct subcellular localization or expression at different times during the life cycle. Examples may include paralogs that are expressed in different tissues or at different developmental stages. The problem is that the \u201cfalse positive\u201d nature can rarely be proven, as there may be unknown conditions under which these proteins do interact with a biological purpose. Overall, few technical false positives can be explained mechanistically, although many may simply do interact non-physiologically. While it often remains difficult to prove the biological significance of an interaction, many studies have attempted to validate them by independent methods. Validating an interaction by other methods certainly increases the probability that it is biologically significant. In a recent study, Rajagopala et al. assess the quality of Y2H interaction by evaluating 114 randomly selected Y2H interactions in two different methods, i.e., coimmunoprecipitation and luminescence-based mammalian interactome mapping (LUMIER) assays and confirmed \u223c86 % of the Y2H interactions by at least one of these biochemical methods (Rajagopala et al. 2014). Similarly, when subsets of the large-scale human Y2H interactomes were evaluated about 65 % of them could be verified by independent orthogonal methods (Rual et al. 2005; Stelzl et al. 2005).",

Protein complexes are often interpreted as if the proteins that co-purify are interacting in a particular manner, consistent with either a spoke or matrix model (Goll and Uetz 2006). The yeast two-hybrid and other orthogonal assays detect direct binary interactions. Combination of both methods will give a better picture of protein complex topology and an experimentally derived confidence score for each interaction. In a recent study Rajagopala et al. compiled a list of 227 E. coli protein complexes that have three or more components as identified by AP-MS studies (Rajagopala et al. 2014). They identified the binary interactions between subunits of these complexes using proteome-scale Y2H data set and literature-curated binary interactions. Integrating these two data sets were able to map 745 binary interactions in 203 complexes, which deduce a putative complete internal topology for 15 multiprotein complexes. For another 45 complexes they determined the putative internal topology of a sub-complex with at least three subunits. However, even the combination of both methods is usually not sufficient to establish accurate topology as some interactions may be too weak to be detected individually.",

In the first step of cloning the gene of interest is inserted into a specific Gateway entry vector by recombining a PCR product of the ORF flanked by attB sites with the attP sites of a pDONR vector (Life Technologies). The resulting entry clone plasmid contains the gene of interest flanked by attL recombination sites. These attL sites can be recombined with attR sites on a destination vector, resulting in a plasmid for functional protein expression in a specific host.

Dip the sterilized pins of the pin replicator (thick pins of \u223c1.5 mm diameter should be used to pin baits) into the bait liquid culture and place directly onto a fresh single-well microtiter plate containing YEPDA agar media. Repeat with the required number of plates and allow the yeast spots to dry onto the plates.4.Pick up the fresh prey array yeast colonies with sterilized pins (thin pins of \u223c1 mm diameter should be used to pin the preys) and transfer them directly onto the baits on the YEPDA plate, so that each of the 384 bait spots per plate receives different prey yeast cells (i.e., a different AD fusion protein). Incubate overnight at 30 \u00b0C to allow mating (Fig. 11.2, step 1).\nNote 4: Mating usually take place in <15 h, but a longer period is recommended because some bait strains show poor mating efficiency. Adding adenine into the bait culture before mating increases the mating efficiency of some baits.\n5.\nSelection of Diploids: For the selection of diploids, transfer the colonies from YEPDA mating plates to diploids selection minimal media agar plates (\u2013Leu \u2013Trp plates) using the sterilized pinning tool (thick pins should be used in this step). Grow the plates for 2\u20133 days at 30 \u00b0C until the colonies are >1 mm in diameter (Fig. 11.2, step 2).\nNote 5: This step is an essential control step to ensure successful mating because only diploid cells containing the Leu2 and Trp1 markers on the prey and bait vectors, respectively, will grow in this medium. This step also helps the recovery of the colonies and increases the efficiency of the next interaction selection step.\n6.\nInteraction selection: Transfer the diploid yeast cells from \u2013Leu \u2013Trp plates to interaction selection minimal media agar plates (\u2013His \u2013Leu \u2013Trp plates), using the sterilized pinning tool. If the baits are auto-activating, they have to be transferred onto \u2013His \u2013Leu \u2013Trp supplemented with a specific concentration of 3-AT plates (Protocol 11.6.1). Incubate the plates at 30 \u00b0C for 4\u20136 days.7.Score the interactions by looking for growing colonies that are significantly above background by size and are present as duplicate or quadruplicate colonies.8.Most two-hybrid-positive colonies appear within 3\u20135 days, but occasionally positive interactions can be observed later. Very small colonies are usually designated as background; however, the real positives signal should be compared with background vector control.9.Scoring can be done manually or using automated image analysis procedures. When using image analysis, care must be taken not to score contaminated colonies as positives.\n",

            "text": "A major consideration when using the Y2H system is the number of false positives, particularly in the pooled library screening. The major sources for false positives are non-reproducible signals that arise through little-understood mechanisms. Thus, pairwise retesting can identify most of the false positives. We routinely use at least duplicate tests, although quadruplicates should be used if possible (Fig. 11.2). Retesting is done by mating the interaction pair to be tested and by comparing the activation strength of this pair with the activation strength of a control, usually the bait mated with the strain that contains the empty prey vector. Testing the reproducibility of an interaction greatly increases the reliability of the Y2H data. Re-array bait and prey strains of each interaction pair to be tested into 96-well microtiter plates. Use separate 96-well plates for baits and preys. For each retested interaction, fill one well of the bait plate and one corresponding well of the prey plate with 150 \u03bcl selective liquid medium (media lacking Leucine or Tryptophan).For each retested interaction, inoculate the bait strain into a well of the 96-well plate and the prey strain at the corresponding position of the 96-well prey plate, for example, bait at position B2 of the bait plate and prey at position B2 of the prey plate. In addition, inoculate the prey strain with the empty prey vector (e.g., strain Y187 with plasmid pGADT7g) into 20 ml selective liquid medium.Incubate the plates overnight at 30 \u00b0C.Mate the baits grown in the bait plate with their corresponding preys in the prey plate. In addition, mate each bait with the prey strain carrying an empty prey vector as a background activation control. The mating is done as described in Protocol 11.6.8, using the bait and prey 96-well plates directly as the source plates.\nNote 8: First the baits are transferred from their 96-well plate to two YEPDA plates (interaction test and control plate) using a 96-well replication tool. Let the plate dry for 10\u201320 min. Then transfer the prey\u2019s from their 96-well plate onto the first YEPDA plate and the empty prey vector control strain onto the second YEPDA plate\nThe transfers to selective plates and incubations are done as described in Protocol 11.6.8. As before, test different baits with different activation strengths on a single plate and pin the diploid cells onto \u2013LTH plates with different concentrations of 3-AT. For choosing the 3-AT range, the activation strengths (Protocol 11.6.7) serve as a guideline.After incubating for 4\u20136 days at 30 \u00b0C on \u2013LTH/3-AT plates, the interactions are scored; positive interactions show a clear colony growth at a certain level of 3-AT, whereas no growth should be seen in the control (bait mated with empty vector strain).\n",
