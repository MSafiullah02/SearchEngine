MERS\u2010CoV is an enveloped virus containing a 30\u2010kb single\u2010stranded, positive\u2010sense RNA genome. Genomic analysis revealed that MERS\u2010CoV is a novel member of the Coronaviridae closely related to two known bat coronaviruses (BtCoV), BtCoV\u2010HKU4 and BtCoV\u2010HKU5, so MERS\u2010CoV has been placed with these viruses in lineage C of the Betacoronavirus genus (van Boheemen et al., 2012).",
