Viral infections may be acute or chronic and clinical symptoms of viral infection may be florid or absent. Viruses may cause rapid death of a host cell or integrate viral genetic material into the host genome. Viral infections can be mild and common, such as rhinovirus causing colds, or rare and devastating, such as Ebola virus causing hemorrhagic fever. Viruses may be highly contagious, such as influenza, or have limited transmission capability, such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Figure 1\n).",

Normal flora are beneficial to us for their roles in food metabolism, protection against pathogenic microbes, production of growth factors, and balancing the interactions of the innate and adaptive immune system with the environment. It is very important to consider the normal flora when interpreting the results of a positive culture. Some normal flora are very rarely pathogens and would not be treated by physicians. An example would be Lactobacillus from a vaginal specimen and most Corynebacteria from a wound/skin specimen. Other organisms recovered are always considered pathogens and must be treated. Examples include rabies virus, Bacillus anthracis, Plasmodium, Listeria, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A third group of organisms are potential pathogens but may colonize some individuals. This group would include viridans streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus, and quite a few of the organisms listed in the table of normal flora. Therefore, it is essential that the laboratory results be interpreted in the context of the clinical scenario.

There are four biosafety levels (BSLs) of increasing precautions as risk increases. BSL1 involves agents that are not known to cause disease consistently in healthy adults. Most routine work in the hospital laboratory, involving the handling of agents that are associated with human disease, is performed with BSL2 precautions in place. Biosafety cabinets for physical containment devises are used for any steps that cause splashing or aerosolization. Personal protective equipment such as lab coats, gloves, and face protection are used as needed per procedure guidelines. BSL3 levels guide the testing of agents that cause more serious disease and/or have a higher potential for aerosolization such as M. tuberculosis and Coccidioides immitis. Increased protection is obtained by limited access to the room containing the lab bench, negative airflow into the laboratory, increased use of the biosafety cabinet, and increased steps to decontaminate waste. BSL4 laboratories are much less common and they deal with the most dangerous agents such as hemorrhagic fever viruses. Additional precautions include very restricted access, additional training and monitoring of staff, changes of clothing, and a positive pressure personnel suit.",

Although tremendous progress has been made during this past century to reduce morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases, especially in developed countries, the percentage of deaths due to infectious diseases compared to many other types of human disease is still quite significant. Diseases that have challenged us for centuries, such as tuberculosis and cholera, still infect and kill many people each year. Although there has been a worldwide campaign to eradicate diseases such as polio, this disease remains to be eliminated from the causes of human disease. While long-standing causes of infectious diseases remain prevalent, new emerging infectious diseases add to the challenge of physicians treating patients. Agents including West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, H5N1 avian influenza virus, HIV, and human metapneumovirus have all appeared or spread widely in recent times. The threat of a pandemic, in which the disease occurs over a very large geographic area, is real, although not a guarantee, and vigilance by public health practitioners and infectious disease specialists around the world will aid in curtailing the next emerging disease. Beyond the confirmed associations of infectious agents with many diseases, there are many cases for which there are limited data to associate a specific disease with an infectious process, and thus, much ongoing research attempts to further determine these associations. More than thirty diseases have some evidence suggesting an infectious agent may be involved, but either no agent has been identified or the evidence is still preliminary. Examples include Crohn's disease, psoriasis, sarcoidosis, diabetes mellitus, chronic fatigue syndrome, and atherosclerosis.",

The diagnostic microbiology laboratory performs testing for surveillance and for transmission investigation. Urinary tract infections are the most common nosocomial infection, followed by surgical wound and respiratory tract infections, and then finally bloodstream infections. New hospital monitoring systems such as the National Healthcare Safety Network now require hospitals to participate in tracking of nosocomial infections. Tracking patients who are colonized with specific resistant organisms, following by implementation of isolation precautions while hospitalized, is of enormous value in protecting susceptible and vulnerable patients from additional infections that could be spread throughout the hospital by healthcare workers.

            "text": "Proper specimen collection is essential for accurate diagnosis of infectious diseases. The correct specimen type must be sent in the correct transport container at the appropriate temperature, without unnecessary delay. These are important issues that are constantly monitored by hospital laboratory services. Examples of common problems include a poorly collected urine specimen that is contaminated by skin/vaginal/fecal flora, a viral culture that is not collected in viral transport medium containing antibiotics to kill bacteria so that the culture is overgrown by bacteria, or failure to collect infected wound tissue in anaerobic transport media even though anaerobes are likely pathogens in the case. Some RNA viruses are labile and culture positivity would decline with a delay in transport. Fortunately, most viral testing is now molecular-based testing, removing the requirement for viable organism for detection, so this issue is not as prevalent at this time. Collection of the appropriate amount of blood for blood cultures in potentially septic patients is critical for optimal detection of the causative microorganism. To improve testing effectiveness, accrediting organizations, such as the College of American Pathologists, have recently added requirements for ongoing monitoring and feedback to clinicians on the blood volumes collected from patients. An improperly collected specimen may result in a missed diagnosis, or alternatively, the report and subsequent treatment of a patient, for an organism that is a commensal or contaminant, along with discontinuation of testing before the true cause of infection is identified. On the appearance of new symptoms in a patient, collection of a specimen prior to antimicrobial administration is important to optimize the potential for a positive culture. This is especially true in a septic patient diagnosed using blood cultures. If the specimen volume is small and many tests are requested, the physician must prioritize the testing, as the limited volume may not be adequate for the initial requested set of assays. Most processing and plating of specimens for culture is done manually by technologists; however, automated systems have been developed to handle and plate specimens. Three examples of automated systems include Kiestra TLA (BD Kiestra B.V., Drachten, the Netherlands), Full Microbiology Laboratory Automation (FMLA; bioM\u00e9rieux, Inc., La Balme, France), and the WASPLab (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA). The high cost of such a system and the inability of the systems to handle unusual containers, small volumes, and complicated test panels result in the systems being most appropriate for large reference laboratories or high-volume laboratories.",

Molecular techniques cannot substitute for this information at this time. Enriched nonselective media that allow growth of many organisms include blood agar, chocolate agar, and thioglycollate broth (Table 4\n). Selective media promote the growth of one group of organisms while inhibiting others. Differential media permit the distinction of different organisms growing on the same media. Selective and differential media include MacConkey agar for Gram-negative bacteria, which permits the distinction of lactose-fermenting organisms due to a pink color of the colonies. Specialized media will promote the growth of a specific organism while inhibiting most other organisms, such as cefsulodin\u2013irgasan\u2013novobiocin agar for Yersinia. To obtain isolated colonies for identification, the agar plates must be streaked appropriately (Figure 22\n). To culture bacteria, the appropriate temperature and gas mixture is essential. Most bacterial are cultured at 35\u201337 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. Organisms may grow in an aerobic (oxygen rich) environment or in an anaerobic (lacking oxygen) environment, or they may be microaerophilic, requiring a low concentration of oxygen, or capnophilic, requiring higher CO2 concentrations for optimal growth. Fungal culture medium contains antibacterial compounds to inhibit bacterial growth and plates are cultured at 30 \u00b0C. Mycobacteria cultures require specialized media and long incubation times, up to weeks compared with the short incubation times of < 24 h for many bacterial cultures.

            "text": "The use of molecular techniques in microbial identification has increased dramatically over the past decade and there is still a rapid rate of introduction of new and revised methods and applications. Detection of an organism's nucleic acid does not require a viable organism, which is a big advantage. Molecular methods overall tend to be very sensitive and specific. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a technique using a tagged nucleic acid probe on cultures or fixed tissue to identify the DNA of the suspected organism (Figure 34\n). PCR is a powerful method and is used in a number of ways. PCR uses a heat-stable DNA polymerase combined with DNA oligomers (primers) of a specific sequence designed to amplify a specific target. Multiple cycles of heating denature the DNA, followed by cooling to allow specific hybridization of primers, and then extension of synthesized product by the polymerase enzyme can result in a millionfold increase in the DNA of interest. The process can be completed in several hours or shorter with new fast instruments (Figure 35\n). Multiple adaptations of PCR include reverse-transcription PCR, which includes an initial step to convert RNA into DNA, followed by DNA amplification, or real-time PCR that permits quantification of the starting nucleic acid. The DNA product is measured in each cycle, often by a fluorescent DNA probe, and the amount of signal on each cycle is proportional to the starting material (Figure 36\n). Real-time PCR is used for cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, BK and JC polyomaviruses, herpesviruses, and quite a few more targets. The conversion of viral testing from viral culture techniques to molecular methods had a huge impact on test turnaround time. Some viral cultures previously took 14\u201321 days, but results can now be obtained in a few hours. Most of virology testing has moved from viral culture, shell-vial culture, rapid immunochromatographic assays, and DFA assays to real-time PCR assays. Multiplex PCR includes multiple primer sets in a single reaction with a number of ingenious ways to separate and detect the signal of the specific pathogens. Assays currently may have 16 or more targets in an individual assay. Respiratory virus detection was greatly improved by multiplex methods compared to culture, DFA assays, antigen detection, and single-target PCR assays. DNA sequencing of the gene for the 16S ribosomal subunit, a component of the cellular protein synthesis machine, is used to identify bacteria that may not be identified by phenotypic methods described earlier. Sequencing ribosomal or other genes may also be used for identification of fungi, mycobacteria, and viruses.",

Because hospitalized individuals are battling their underlying illnesses, they are vulnerable to severe complications from a nosocomial infection. Similarly, an outbreak of an organism in the community is tracked by public health labs to determine the source of infections and to stop an outbreak if possible. Some of the systems to investigate clonality (genetic similarity) of organisms include pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), plasmid profiling, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), repetitive-element PCR, and genome sequencing. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)-based methods utilize the variation in DNA fragments obtained upon a specific restriction enzyme digestion of bacterial genomic DNA. PFGE involves digestion of isolates by restriction enzymes in an agarose plug, choosing an enzyme that will result in 10\u201320 DNA fragments. Then, the DNA is separated by a specialized electrophoresis device that uses a pulsed electric field (Figure 38\n). The RFLPs are compared by analyzing multiple isolates on the same gel to determine similarity of the patterns. Plasmid profiling involves gel electrophoresis of plasmids after disruption of genomic DNA. The discriminating power of this method is variable. Repetitive-element PCR amplifies the region between interspersed repetitive DNA elements. The amplicons generated will vary between strains, thus allowing determination of strain similarity in an outbreak. MLST detects variations due to mutations or recombination by direct sequencing of fragments in housekeeping genes or another specific set of genes, such as virulence genes. The different MLST profiles of organisms under investigation are then compared. Whole-genome sequencing is now possible as an epidemiological tool. With the decrease in the cost of sequencing, entire genomes can be compared and single-nucleotide polymorphisms, deletions, insertions, or recombinations can be detected. Only a limited number of labs have access to whole-genome sequence techniques and the bioinformatics experts to analyze the data.

            "text": "To choose the most appropriate antimicrobial agent for treatment of a patient's infection, susceptibility testing in the laboratory can be essential. Empirical therapy that is started at the time of symptoms, before a definitive diagnosis is established or before a causative pathogen is identified, is usually very broadly active, may have unwanted side effects, and may be inactive against the true infecting agent. Furthermore, widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics contributes to the spread of organisms that are resistant to multiple antibiotics. So for multiple reasons, it is important to identify the specific antimicrobial therapy for a specific infection. Antibacterial agents work through various mechanisms including disruption of cell wall synthesis, inhibition of cell membrane function, inhibition of protein synthesis, inhibition of DNA/RNA synthesis, or inhibition of metabolic processes. Different organisms have developed various mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. The susceptibility testing must be standardized for accuracy. Methods include broth dilution, agar dilution, disk diffusion, broth microdilution, E-test gradients, and genotypic methods. Various methods are illustrated in Figure 39, Figure 40, Figure 41, Figure 42, Figure 43\n. For each, the organism is incubated in the presence of different concentrations of the drug to determine the lowest concentration that inhibits the growth of the organism, thus determining the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). To determine the clinical significance of the data and to translate the MIC from the laboratory into information that the physician can use to determine if the drug will likely be effective to treat a specific patient, guidelines have been established by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Some susceptibility testing methods are manual and labor-intensive. However, multiple automated instruments have been developed to test antimicrobial susceptibility in broth culture, detect the MIC, and interpret the MIC. Expert software has been written to check for unusual patterns that may indicate an error in organism identification or resistance patterns that signal a multidrug-resistant organism. A separate approach to susceptibility testing is the detection of a resistance gene with molecular methods. These methods can be much more rapid than phenotypic testing. Examples of common genotypic testing include the mecA gene used to detect MRSA and the vanA gene used to detect vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. Sophisticated phenotypic and genotypic testing of HIV is performed routinely by specialized laboratories for optimal choice of highly active antiretroviral therapy. Because host factors and the organ infected can influence the effectiveness of the chosen therapy, patient symptoms must be monitored closely and therapy adjusted if the patient is not improving on the drug to which the organism was reported to be sensitive.",

            "text": "All microbiological test results must be interpreted in the context of the patient. Each organism identified in a specimen may be a pathogen, a component of commensal flora, or an environmental contaminant. The underlying condition of the patient will strongly influence the interpretation of the laboratory data. Patients who are immunocompromised due to autoimmune diseases, cancer chemotherapy, HIV infection, immunomodulating therapy, or genetic disorders that result in immunocompromise are more likely have true infections from an opportunistic pathogen than an otherwise healthy, immunocompetent host. Molecular methods may detect DNA of a nonviable organism or detect a very low burden of organism that is not responsible for the symptoms of the patient. Interpretation will be affected by the age of the patient. Newborns, children, and adults have different pretest probabilities of some specific causes of infection. For example, meningitis in a newborn is more likely to be due to Escherichia coli or group B Streptococcus, whereas meningitis in an older patient may be due to Neisseria meningitidis or enterovirus. Contamination of cultures with organisms that are potential pathogens can complicate interpretation of results. If an environmental organism that has never been reported to cause human disease is isolated, it is almost certainly a contaminant. One would need to do an extensive investigation to confirm that a new organism was responsible for disease. In some cases, based on the colony location on a nutrient agar plate, it is easy to determine if an isolate is a laboratory contaminant. In other cases, it is much more difficult, so contamination must be kept to an absolute minimum with strict sterile technique when processing and working up cultures. Another important feature of interpretation may be the quantity of organism in the specimen. A small amount of a potential pathogen in a culture that is mixed with multiple other bacteria may suggest that the organism is a colonizer, whereas a heavy growth of a single organism type is more likely a pathogen. A urine culture is an example of a routine quantitative culture that is interpreted based on the mixture and quantity of organisms present. In some cases, lower respiratory tract or wound cultures may be quantitative. It is essential to know the list of normal flora for each specimen source when interpreting results. Identification of an organism from a sterile site is almost always significant, with the exception of contaminated specimens. For phenotypic methods, it is not always possible to identify an organism with absolute certainty. A lab may report a result as \u2018most consistent with organism X.\u2019 This occurs partly because not every organism of a specific species may give the same enzymatic result for one test. Likewise, for sequencing and MALDI-TOF results, the data may not be adequate to distinguish between several species, and several possible organisms may be reported. When a specimen is cultured in the clinical lab, results are often available in a series of steps. The direct Gram stain is known immediately, and then isolates grown from the culture may be evident in 12, 24, 48, 72 h, or longer. A culture might have several microorganisms evident on different days. The treating physician receives preliminary reports, followed by updates as they become available. The clinician, with the aid of the clinical microbiologist, must create a differential diagnosis including the list of organisms that fit the data to date and then treat the patient with antimicrobials to cover possible organisms. They must weigh the risks and benefits of narrowing therapy at any given time, balancing the negative aspect of toxicity of several broad-spectrum agents against the benefit of covering all possible likely pathogens until the culture results are finalized. The severity of illness of the patient will greatly impact these decisions.",

In some situations, multiple assays will be used simultaneously to rule out an infection, such as cultures from multiple sites, combined with a molecular assay, combined with serological testing.

Advances in molecular technology have been of great value in this area, expanding the number of bacteria and viruses that we can detect.

Serology, as discussed, also assists in the diagnosis of organisms that we cannot grow. Testing in the clinical lab is optimized for human pathogens. Environmental organisms may not grow.

One approach to reduce turnaround time for blood cultures is the use of FISH, which uses peptide nucleic acid probes targeting specific microbe 16S rRNA after a blood culture has flagged positive. A limitation is that the FISH probes will detect only organisms that are targeted, missing organisms not targeted with the selected set of probes. Although faster than traditional bacterial identification systems that require incubation time for enzymatic or carbohydrate utilization assays to occur, there is extra work to run the FISH and then to perform further testing when required. Workflow and cost considerations prevent some labs from adopting this approach. Another rapid approach is to perform MALDI-TOF analysis directly from extracted material from a positive blood culture, without waiting for isolation of specific organisms. Of significant note, organisms will often be missed in mixed infections for a number of these rapid approaches, so a complete workup of all organisms present in a blood culture is still required. The positive outcome of these rapid approaches is that preliminary data are provided to clinicians for rapid refinement of the differential diagnosis and possible early treatment changes. Scientists continue to work on the \u2018Holy Grail\u2019 of complete microorganism identification directly from patient specimens without the need for culture.

The CLSI is a consensus body created to make decisions on best available data, including pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, animal models, in vitro testing, computer simulations, and limited patient outcome data. When there are multiple options for therapy because an organism tests sensitive to multiple drugs, the method generally works well. But when an organism is resistant to many drugs, then the best option clinically is not always clear. Within the past several years, the guidelines provided by CLSI have changed the cutoff values for the MIC value that should be translated into sensitive, intermediate, or resistant for a number of organism/drug combinations. Because the FDA approval of microbiology equipment is independent of the CLSI process, this resulted in different labs using different cutoffs based on which FDA-approved instrument or method they used.
