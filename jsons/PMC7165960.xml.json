No, it opted to support such gene\u2010sequencing only in special instances and on a small scale. It was a large firm, Merck, that decided to fund this work and make it freely available. A consortium of companies teamed up with a few academic institutions to establish a collection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). They filed patents with the full intention of abandoning them, in order to bolster the public domain. Why? To thwart the efforts of many other companies and universities to patent SNPs.",

Some of these reasons are obvious, but some are not so obvious and may even be counterintuitive. One way to understand these complex dynamics of innovation is through empirical studies, and some excellent work in this field does exactly that. The main approach we will take, however, is historical, focusing on genomics and microbiological resources as a field of study, but occasionally straying into related fields of biomedical research (such as bioinformatics or molecular and cellular biology) when they provide better examples to illustrate a point. We will also discuss examples from the broader field of biological resources in general, because of the many analogies between genomics, and studies of life sciences related to microbes and higher life forms.",

In the same vein, \u201cScience Commons\u201d is a specific organisation that has spun out of the Creative Commons movement. Science Commons moved from concept to action in the year 2005, with an office and executive director (John Wilbanks) to carry out its mission of \u201cmaking it easier for scientists, universities, and industries to use literature, data, and other scientific intellectual property and to share their knowledge with others. Science Commons works within current copyright and patent law to promote legal and technical mechanisms that remove barriers to sharing\u201d.\n1\n While we endorse their mission, they may not endorse our analysis; we have no direct connection to the organisation, and do not speak for it.",

There are many terms marching under the banner of open science or public research. \u201cOpen access\u201d, for example, can mean free access to view information, but not necessarily freedom to use it in all ways without restriction. To some, open science means no one can fence it in. Access to information, say through \u201cviral\u201d licensing or copyleft, may be conditional on agreeing not to restrict subsequent users. Information may also simply be put into the public domain, for example by depositing it at a freely available public database, for any and all subsequent uses, both proprietary and open. We focus on this last meaning, with information available to all at low or no cost. Sometimes there are restrictions on its use, but those restrictions must also involve minimal or zero costs. And we do not assume that once information is in the commons it is irreversibly fixed there. It can, in some cases, be used and removed with restrictions imposed; but then it is no longer part of the science commons.",

In particular, the structure of the science commons in genomics and microbiology differs in important respects from the science commons of the \u201copen source\u201d communities or the Creative Commons project. That is why it is important to qualify what we mean by open access. Adapting the conventional categories from new institutional economics (see, for example, Schlager and Ostrom 1993) to the life sciences, we can distinguish three important categories of access and use rights. First, access can refer simply to the right to access a resource without being allowed to transform it or do any further research on it. This can be the case when a resource is used for educational purposes for instance. Second, accessing a resource can include the right to transform it and develop new lines of research. Third, in certain cases, permission is given to develop and commercialize follow\u2010on applications. Using these categories, we can distinguish between the following rights that define the components of the science commons in the life sciences:",

Hence, in evaluating historical examples in their particular context, the institutional structures and the type of collective action has to be specified for each case. What organisations played a major role in the establishment of this science commons? What were the norms of the communities that drove this evolution? And what were the characteristics that enabled collective action in successful cases of the science commons? To deal with these questions, we will first discuss the case of human genetics, because of the historical importance of this case and also because of the key role of genetics in general in the ongoing transformation of research in the life sciences. Next, we will broaden the discussion to other fields of the life sciences, such as plant genetics and general\u2010purpose biotech research tools, to show that in these fields also there is a growing need to systematically address data access and sharing of microbiological information and resources. The data we draw on come mainly from public documents and literature review of case studies in the field. However, informal contacts with officials from umbrella organisations such as the World Federation for Culture Collections (WFCC) and the International Council for Science (ICSU), as well as contacts with genome scientists and bio\u2010informatics researchers in our home universities, also played a key role in the process of sorting out the data.",

In particular, research into the properties of whole organisms, ranging from microbes to animals, overlaps with molecular genetics and genomics, proteomics and the development of research tools for screening and genetic engineering. In practice, this has led to hybrid biological research facilities and networks, dedicated to collecting whole organisms but also key parts of organisms such as plasmids (circular DNA, used in biotechnology), cell lines and even entire organisms (in the case of microbes). Prominent examples include the international ex situ seed banks of the 15 Future Harvest Centers,\n6\n but the same evolution can be observed in the development of biobanks of human tissues (e.g., for cancer research) or vectors used in the highly touted field of genetic therapy.

            "text": "Second, there is extensive overlap between academic health research and the science commons in molecular biology. Academic science is important in many fields, not just the life sciences. In all lines of scientific and technical work, universities, not\u2010for\u2010profit research institutions, and government laboratories (referred to collectively here as academic research institutions) play key roles. Many people have been trained in academe, not just the people doing R&D, but also corporate managers and IT professionals, and have thus benefited from the exchange of ideas in academic science. Academe is also one place where the norms of Mertonian science have real traction, where the norms of openness, community, mutual criticism, and fair allocation of credit are supposed to be respected. In some circumstances, however, academic science is done in secret, or results are made available only at great cost or encumbered by restrictions on their use. Such science is not part of a science commons. Great science goes on in industry, including, or even particularly, in the life sciences, but no one expects the norms of openness to prevail in industrial R&D, even if in some circumstances they do. When they do, the results flowing from industrial R&D can become part of the science commons, and there are several instances of this in the case studies to follow.",

One reason for interest in academia is that policies put in place over the past three decades have raised concerns about how big the science commons will be, and in particular, whether and to what degree government and not\u2010for\u2010profit funders and academic research institutions will maintain it.",

Craig Venter, who in 1998 announced his intention to sequence the genome at a new start\u2010up company Celera, and the public Human Genome Project whose most conspicuous spokesmen were Francis Collins in the United States and Sir John Sulston in the United Kingdom. Collins was director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at NIH, and Sulston directed the Sanger Centre affiliated with the University of Cambridge and funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust and UK Medical Research Council. A consortium of laboratories funded by government agencies and not\u2010for\u2010profit organisations in North America, Europe and Japan constituted the \u201cpublic genome project\u201d. Sulston emerged as the rhetorical champion of that faction,\n7\n emphasising open science, rapid sharing of data and materials, and a passionate appeal to refrain from patenting bits of the human genome except when they could foreseeably induce investment in the development of end\u2010products such as therapeutic proteins. In 1996, the Wellcome Trust sponsored a Bermuda meeting of the major sequencing centres throughout the world. A set of \u201cBermuda Rules\u201d emerged from the meeting, mandating daily public disclosure of DNA sequence data. The pledge to share data rapidly was linked to a plea not to patent DNA without significantly further characterising gene function and demonstrating utility. Characterising gene function was not the business of the publicly funded DNA sequencing centres, so the Bermuda Rules were in effect a \u201cno patents\u201d policy for the sequencing centres.",

Many other companies were mapping and sequencing parts of the human genome, and thousands of laboratories were contributing sequencing and mapping information to databases and to scientific publications.

Second, private R&D investment was a powerful adjunct to the public and not\u2010for\u2010profit funding. It followed public R&D in time, and it drew on the science commons without necessarily contributing to it. Its social benefit derived from developing goods and services that would otherwise not be produced. But third, and most to the point for policy purposes, it would be foolhardy to generalize from those happy circumstances where private R&D expands the science commons \u2013 to expect private R&D always to contribute to the science commons except in unusual circumstances, usually related to particular features of competition among firms in a particular industrial sector.",

Murphy and Topel (1999) estimated that the economic gains from increased life expectancy attributable to medical research were staggering \u2013 in the range of $2.8 trillion per year from 1970 to 1990 ($1.5 trillion of this from cardiovascular disease reduction). Many of the health benefits of discovering new information about health and disease come not from drugs, vaccines, or medical services, but from individuals acting on information. Cutler and Kadiyala (2001) attributed two\u2010thirds of the health gains in cardiovascular disease reduction to the effects of \u201cpublic information\u201d, such as stopping or reducing tobacco use, changing diet, getting more exercise, and monitoring blood pressure. The second largest determinant was technological change, such as the introduction of new drugs and services, followed by increasing cigarette taxes to reduce tobacco use (Cutler and Kadiyala 2001). The estimated return on investment in medical treatment was 4 to 1, but on public information it was 30 to 1.",

Cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease, among others, appear far less tractable. Few if any risk factors will ever be found to rival tobacco use as predictors of poor health. But the finding that information can have an economic value irrespective of being translated into products and services in a paying market is nonetheless important. Even if public information will not be quite as powerful in reducing other chronic diseases as it has been for cardiovascular disease, the vector is likely to point in the same direction. We cannot say that public information will always prove more powerful than information channelled into new drugs, vaccines, biologics, devices, and medical services in the health care system. But if there are any more such instances \u2013 and the probability that there will be none seems vanishingly small \u2013 then the health science commons is essential, because it alone can supply the public information benefits. Proprietary science cannot produce public goods, both by definition and for instrumental reasons \u2013 to produce such benefits it would have to be shared at no cost. Both words in \u201cpublic information\u201d do a lot of work.

The 2002 report from the World Health organisation, Genomics and World Health gave the example of fosmidomycin (WHO 2002, p. 49). This drug is currently being tested in the treatment of malaria in Africa (Missinou et al. 2002). That use came to light as a consequence of sequencing the genome of the malaria parasite, and noticing a metabolic pathway not previously known to exist. The compound fosmidomycin was known to inhibit the pathway, and had been developed as a treatment for urinary tract infections. When the possibility of using the drug to treat malaria was revealed, it was pulled off the shelf and moved into clinical trials. This is a treatment that may never produce a profit for any company, but the social returns could be enormous if the drug works, because so many millions of people are infected with malaria. If not fosmidomycin, then perhaps other findings will lead to the prevention or treatment of malaria, enabled by the existence of the full genomic sequences for host, pathogen, and mosquito vector.\n9\n Making the information about these organisms available worldwide is essential to accruing the benefits of research. There is only a weak world market in drugs to treat malaria because it is largely an affliction in resource\u2010poor populations. The usual profit motives of the intellectual property system cannot create incentives where there is no prospect of profit to drive products through an expensive discovery and testing process. But networks of not\u2010for\u2010profit organisations, such as the Malaria Vaccine Initiative, the Global Fund, the WHO essential medicines programme, and other sources of \u201cpublic\u201d capital might be capable of discovering and developing new treatments despite the absence of commercial profit.

They could be used as DNA markers to trace inheritance, look for associations with diseases or traits, and study population differences: SNPs were valuable research tools. Many genomics firms, including Celera, began to signal that they were finding SNPs and filing patent applications. Given the uncertain rules over what patents the patent office would issue, it seemed possible that they would succeed in getting patents, meaning that anyone using a particular SNP would need to get a licence. This raised the prospect of needing to get licences on hundreds or even thousands of SNP sequences from some unknown (but potentially large) number of patent owners. This was just the kind of nightmare situation that Michael Heller and Rebecca Eisenberg had speculated might arise in their classic 1998 article on the \u201canticommons\u201d\u2013 a situation when too many exclusive rights upstream needed to be assembled, thus thwarting the development of final products, such as drugs, vaccines, biologics, or instruments (Heller and Eisenberg 1998).",

The discovery of these bacteria was a scientific milestone, as it demonstrated that life could exist at much higher temperatures than had formerly been believed possible. But at that time they did not know that it would have far more important implications. The strain that was isolated from this discovery was deposited at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) in Washington DC, the largest culture collection in the world, holding over 70,000 strains from microbiological material from all over the world. They named the organism Thermus aquaticus (Taq) and published their work on its DNA in 1969.",

The Taq enzyme greatly simplified this method, which makes millions of copies of DNA segments without using a living organism, and has become an extremely widely used method in molecular biology. This technique is still further developed and widely used in applications such as genomic fingerprinting, the diagnosis of infectious diseases, and the study of genetic mutations.

Moreover, in health research, it is estimated that 25 per cent of all new drugs are based directly or indirectly on natural plants or organisms.\n13\n In agriculture and the food industry, wild varieties of plants or specimen of animals frequently travel around the world and are exchanged between different research and conservation facilities, before leading to new applications that are then marketed by private companies. For instance, the development of fish farming received an important impetus from the development of new varieties of tilapia, a tropical river fish that is found in several African countries (Greer and Harvey 2004, pp. 135\u2013141). Several varieties of tilapia have been developed at the World Fish Centre in Malaysia (part of the Collaborative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) network) and are now used in fish farming in both developed and developing nations.

Especially when biological resources come from fragile ecosystems and in the case of traditional knowledge, fair compensation for their contribution to the production and conservation of resources and information is a legitimate claim by the local population. That is why a group of scientists involved in bioprospecting, who met in 1988 at Belem at an international meeting of the ethnobotanical society, adopted a series of rules for organising bioprospecting, requiring prior informed consent by the communities before biological resources and related information were accessed and used.

Many other databases were established to retain data on human genetic maps of various types, and the same is true for other organisms. The DNA sequence data in the GenBank database were collected primarily by a trio of teams in the United States, Europe, and Japan, and these shared data among themselves. Creating and coordinating these databases, including the sequence databases, was a major struggle (Smith 1990), but the battle was waged with only limited concern for their commercial potential.

At the same time, they may undercut wide and early diffusion of research results, and so can have a long\u2010term negative effect on innovation. We can illustrate this dilemma with a case study on the history of plant breeding in the field of agriculture (Goeschl and Swanson 2002). Intellectual property in new seed varieties obtained through cross\u2010breeding has been an important driver of research. This has led to new crops such as rice, maize, and corn with great potential for increasing food security in developing countries. However, over the period from 1961 to 1999 for which data are available, the diffusion of innovation in the two crops with the highest protection, maize and sorghum, is lower than that in other crops. In this period, the gap between developing and developed countries in the productivity of maize and sorghum was 50 per cent higher, compared to the other crops, ranging up to 72 per cent; for maize and 62 per cent; for sorghum. The evidence further shows that enhanced property regimes work against the interests of the states that are furthest from the technological frontier of innovation. The poorest and least advanced fare worst. A similar story could be told about the drugs contributing to public health (such as anti\u2010AIDS drugs) or for basic research tools in biotechnology.

However, for both patented and public\u2010domain sequences, important incentives exist to publish rapidly, and deposit data in GenBank. Having a sequence published on GenBank (or any alternative recognised international e\u2010repository) is a requirement for publishing scientific research on a new gene sequence in most journals. The provision of gene sequences to this international science commons is thus assured through its connection with publication, and thus with the collaborative effort of the basic scientific research community in the life sciences.\n18\n Making new genetic sequences of organisms rapidly publicly available is necessary both for fundamental research (as a common reference point for all research that refers to that genetic sequence) and for the rapid development of new applications (as in the development of a new drug for malaria discussed above).",

The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) makes information on these resources freely available through a global data portal on the Internet (James 2002). The situation for culture collections is thus in many respects similar to GenBank. Some of the incentives are also the same. The collection of strains by researchers is an important part of the discovery process in microbiology. Researchers deposit their strains in the national culture collections. To publish an article on a newly discovered strain, two samples have to be deposited in two different culture collections. Another important source of strains is the requirement to deposit strains in a culture collection when applying for patent protection. However, there are also some important differences between GenBank and GBIF. The information and quality management at GBIF is much more decentralised. GBIF only offers a common portal and data format allowing access to the several hundred nation\u2010based culture collections. Each of these collections manages its own database and has its own rules for intellectual property rights and conditions of use.\n19\n\n",

As we have argued throughout the paper, the science commons plays an important role in making wide diffusion of research results possible, through both public and private actors. For instance, in the case of cDNA fragments, a private company funded the work to make cDNA sequences publicly accessible. This effort was important in making a basic research tool widely accessible and stimulating its rapid diffusion. In another consortium, the yeast sequencing programme in Europe, public and private partners collaborated in the first networked DNA sequencing enterprise (Cassier and Foray 1999). It was agreed that the fragments that were sequenced would remain private property during the development of the programme, but that once the complete genome was mapped all the sequences were made publicly accessible. This was done when the over\u20106,000 genes of the whole genome had been sequenced, in an article published in Nature in 1997.",

In the World Fish Centre,\n20\n new breeds of tilapia, a tropical river fish originally found in Central and East Africa, were developed for use in aquaculture (Greer and Harvey 2004, pp. 135\u2013141). New breeds were expected to become one of the most important species in aquaculture, and potentially to contribute to enhancing food security in developing countries. After the breeds were developed, discussions followed on how to transfer improvements to the local populations. In 1999, a corporate partner, GenoMar, was found. GenoMar received the exclusive licence to market a specific variety of a new breed, called \u201csuper\u2010tilapia\u201d, in the Philippines, while the property rights on all the other varieties of new breeds remained with the World Fish Centre. Those varieties remain freely available for direct use in developing countries. Thus, in this case diffusion is organised by open access to the original varieties of new breeds, so that they can be used in aquaculture in developing countries, while the investment in the further development of specific commercial varieties is organised through and exclusive licence to the corporate partner.",

In this case, a resistant breed of rice was collected from a community in western Africa (Mali), and brought by an Indian researcher to the IRRC in the Philippines where it was crossbred to develop a commercial variety (Gupta 2004, pp. 75\u2013102). Finally, the University of California (UC) Davis sequenced the genome of the new variety and acquired patent rights to it. In spite of this property right, the science commons was preserved through a variety of collective agreements. First, researchers at UC Davis created the genetic recognition fund to share the benefits of commercial exploitation with the farmers in the provider country.\n22\n Second, the IRRC retained the rights to do further research on the rice for non\u2010commercial purposes, and it was agreed that, if any new follow\u2010on application followed, no action would be taken to impede commercialisation of the new variety.\n23\n\n",

In particular, as we attempted to show, commercialisation of R&D in the life science is not the problem as such. In some cases, private sector initiatives contributed in important ways to the building of the science commons (cf. Table 3). The real challenge is how to provide incentives to invest into the production of general purpose knowledge on the one hand and into broad diffusion of the exploitable research results on the other. This is a challenge both for public and private sector research.",

Building capacity for developing new norms in these different communities, such as the norms set out in the Bermuda Rules in the human genome story, the prior informed consent rules adopted by the culture collections, or the corporate social responsibility in the case of Merck and the SNP Consortium are clearly important steps in this direction. The second lesson brings us back to the production of knowledge in Pasteur's Quadrant. Our hypothesis is that the science commons contributes to solving some of the dilemmas arising from the provision and use of knowledge in the general interest. Both our narrative and our brief review of the political economy of producing genomic knowledge show that this is in no way an automatic process. Diffusion of knowledge and the exploration of new lines of innovation depend on creating institutions for collective action. As we have seen in our evaluation, collective action has been highly successful in life sciences research in furthering the provision and use of knowledge. Sustaining this effort will, however, require continued institutional experimentation. And because of the institutional diversity, analysis of the conditions for success will be needed. How the collective action by involved stakeholders worked in these experiments will need to be studied, and a process of self\u2010evaluation and adjustment will surely play an important role in this.",
