Even stool collection has been an issue with the concern of the virus shed in stool. That was the impetus for the attached in silico study. We tested the hypothesis that the EHI would continue to be of value for physicians and patients in the face of elevated CRP driven by infection. Our results demonstrate that indeed the EHI is largely unchanged. Although ideally we would test actual patient samples with high CRP, these data provide reassurance that EHI can be used to examine active Crohn's disease and make clinical decisions.",

Median change in EHI score in specimens within the original EHI<20 group varied from 1 to 3 EHI units when CRP concentrations were increased from 10 mg/L to 60 mg/L ( Figure 1 ). The impact of increasing CRP levels on EHI categorical assignment (Table 1) revealed that 84.6% specimens presenting with EHI <20 remained within that group in the presence of several fold increased CRP to 10 mg/L (median increase: 2 EHI units, IQR: [1] [2] [3] ). Very large increase in CRP (to 60 mg/L) resulted in 31.8% specimens changing EHI assignment from <20 to \u226520 but even this large increase in CRP concentration did not result in EHI >50.",

Because CRP is a systemic inflammatory biomarker, it may not be reliable for measuring disease activity of CD in patients who may also have COVID-19 infection.

Results from this simulation exercise are not unexpected as the biomarkers within the EHI algorithm are weighted i.e., contribution of each biomarker to the algorithm is different. Therefore, the algorithm is not dependent on any one biomarker such as CRP but the EHI score is the result of all 13 biomarkers. In summary, EHI is potentially a reliable and robust alternative for the non-invasive assessment of objective disease activity in CD patients.A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 7",
