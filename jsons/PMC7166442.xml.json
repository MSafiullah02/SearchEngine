This lack of repeated HCoV infections may have been influenced by there being 0.98 RI per subject meeting eligibility criteria for assessment during the study, and it is not known how often a clinically significant natural exposure to HCoV might have occurred causing risk for infection. Since preexisting serum antibodies were present, they did not necessarily provide protection from infection with HCoV, but may have reduced the number of clinically evaluable infections and severity. The PCR was positive for HCoV nucleic acids only in a minority of RI in this study, so antibodies may have reduced virus shedding that was detectable in respiratory secretions during acute illness. Time of specimen collection after onset of RI could have affected PCR positivity rates, as well. A seroconversion threshold for binding antibody titers of more than threefold in association with acute RI was an inconsistent predictor of concomitant fourfold neutralizing antibody change, and \u2265fourfold changes in binding antibodies were not statistically better. Antibody GMTs to each HCoV strain did not increase statistically comparing acute to convalescent sera calculated with values from all 43 illnesses. These GMTs were calculated because of the evidence for cross\u2010reactive antibody responses against at least related strains (Alphacoronaviruses vs Betacoronaviruses).

Concomitant infection with more than one strain of HCoV during the same RI would be unlikely. Repeated infections with HCoV may partially be explained if natural infection in these adult patients stimulates binding antibodies more commonly than functional neutralizing antibodies. Nonneutralizing antibodies are known to bind to other viral proteins such as the N protein. Stimulation of antibodies to non\u2010S protein epitopes could be an explanation for low correlation between stimulation of binding antibody and neutralizing antibody since neutralizing antibody is directed against the S protein. The psoralen\u2010UV light method of virus inactivation used here should have preserved viral antigenicity, but we did not determine against which viral proteins the binding antibodies were directed. The orientation of the viral antigens coating the ELISA microtiter plates may have affected the epitopes exposed and available for antibody binding. Also, it is possible that some binding antibodies may enhance infection and not be protective against reinfection. Antibody\u2010dependent enhancement of SARS\u2010CoV and feline infectious peritonitis virus (a member of the coronavirus genus and antigenically related to \u2010229E) infectivity has been reported and can be mediated by antibodies to S protein epitopes.\n15\n, \n23\n, \n24\n, \n25\n Also, studies of the S protein sequence and neutralization antigenicity suggest that serum antibodies which neutralize clinical HCoV isolates may not cross\u2010react as well with the laboratory strains of HCoV that were used in our neutralization assays, affecting the sensitivity of the neutralization assay that was employed here.\n4\n, \n6\n Indeed, quasi\u2010species of HCoV\u2010OC43 were detected in respiratory secretions in our patients, with mutational peaks in the S1 region of the Spike protein that could lead to differences in antigenicity,\n26\n and lower neutralization antibody levels and response rates against laboratory\u2010adapted strains.",

The binding antibodies that were detected in the ELISA, utilizing inactivated whole HCoV\u2010229E, \u2010OC43, and \u2010NL63 viruses, were likely directed against more HCoV proteins than just the S protein compared to the neutralizing antibodies that are directed against epitopes of the S protein. The method of virus inactivation that was used may have preserved the integrity of virions and their antigenicity. We did not confirm that binding antibodies detected in the ELISA were directed against more than the S protein antigens. Only binding antibodies to the recombinant N protein could be measured in the case of \u2010HKU1. There were positive statistical correlations between binding antibody levels in both acute and convalescent sera within HCoV genera. There appeared to be closer correlations between binding antibodies and neutralizing antibodies in the convalescent sera than acute illness sera particularly for HCoV\u2010NL63 and for \u2010OC43, respectively, and closer binding antibody correlations between strains within the Alphacoronavirus (HCoV\u2010229E and \u2010NL63) and between strains within the Betacoronavirus (HCoV\u2010OC43 and \u2010HKU1) genera.",

Patients with MERS\u2010CoV infections are seronegative at onset of illness and can develop both binding and potentially protective neutralizing antibodies that correlate in convalescent sera. Delayed serologic responses occur in those with more severe illness and higher viral shedding.\n10\n In contradistinction, our HCoV\u2010experienced subjects were already seropositive for the four strains at onset of the RI. Increases in binding antibodies bracketing RI, signaling likely intercurrent HCoV infection, were more frequent than increased neutralizing antibodies and viral nucleic acids detected in respiratory secretions, and more frequent in young compared to older adults. There were correlations between binding and neutralizing antibodies for homologous and for related HCoV strains, though not statistically significant for all comparisons. It is unlikely that there were simultaneous infections with more than one strain of HCoV, so concomitant increases in binding and neutralizing antibodies to more than one strain was consistent with stimulation of cross\u2010reactive antibodies and recall of immune memory. Susceptibility to repeated infections with HCoV may be explained in part by a stimulation of neutralizing antibodies in a minority of RI with increases in binding antibodies. Since binding antibodies increased more commonly than neutralizing antibodies, they may be a more sensitive seroepidemiological tool than neutralizing antibodies for identifying RI due to common HCoV strains.",
