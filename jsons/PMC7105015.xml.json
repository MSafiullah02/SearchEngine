The acute phase of myocarditis takes only a few days: viral entry and replication induces acute injury to the myocytes, leading to myocyte necrosis; subsequent exposure of intracellular antigens is followed by activation of the host's immune system, which is characterized by the invasion of natural killer cells and macrophages, followed by T-lymphocytes [3]. The subacute phase of myocarditis, which may occur a few weeks to several months after the initial infection, is characterized by myocardial inflammation mediated by the effector cells of the immune system (cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages), by loco-regional effect of inflammatory mediators released by the infiltrating lymphocytes, macrophages or endothelial cells, and by direct interaction of the antibodies against myocardial cells [3], [7]. The chronic phase of myocarditis is then characterized by multifocal myocardial replacement fibrosis, systolic dysfunction, and development of a DCM with segmental dyskinesis (i.e. inflammatory cardiomyopathy DCM) [3].",

Arteriosclerosis is characterized by intimal thickening of coronary arterial wall due to hyaline material deposition, proliferation of smooth muscle cells, and fibrocytes. This pathologic process causes a progressive occlusion of the vessel lumen, and a relatively high prevalence of this alteration has been reported in dogs with congestive heart failure [11]. Despite this occurrence, infarcts in dogs are very rarely caused by atherosclerosis, as opposed to human beings [12]. Spontaneous atherosclerosis has been reported in dogs mainly in association with secondary hypercholesterolemia due to endocrinopathies (primarily hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus) [13].",

The profound degree of myocardial injury documented at necropsy supported this hypothesis. Left bundle branch block with a prolonged QRS duration of \u2265120 ms and the presence of ventricular ectopic beats are reported in human medicine to be independent predictors for cardiac death or heart transplantation [18]. In dogs, left bundle brunch block with advanced hypokinetic cardiomyopathy is also associated with increased mortality risk [19]. Because of the frequent ventricular arrhythmias noted in this case, mexiletine was prescribed in order to preserve systolic dysfunction while resolving acute cardiac failure. Unfortunately, the dog died before a Holter could be performed, so detailed information about the quality of the arrhythmia throughout a 24-hour period, as well as response to treatment, are missing.",

Chronic myocarditis is characterized histologically by mononuclear cell infiltrates, aggregated interstitial fibrosis, and fatty infiltration [24]. The Dallas criteria are limited by the high inter-observer variability in interpreting biopsy specimens and because non-cellular inflammatory processes cannot be detected [23]. Despite the considerable limitations of EMB findings, EMB remain the gold standard for unequivocally establishing the diagnosis. Additionally, with the introduction of immunohistological methods, the number of EMB revealing myocarditis has markedly increased [3], [9]. According to the WHO/International Society and Federation of Cardiology Task Force on the Definition and Classification of Cardiomyopathies, EMB are considered to be positive for myocarditis by immunohistochemical detection of focal or diffuse mononuclear infiltrates (T-lymphocytes and macrophages) with >14 cells/mm2\n[25]. The identification of the causative agents of myocarditis can be performed by the application of molecular biological tools to EMB [3].",
