Initially, WHO nominated such infl uenza as \"human-infected swine infl uenza.\" However, such a nomination may cause misunderstandings about intake of pork and pork products.

Therefore, the infl uenza is known as \"North American Infl uenza\" by the World Organisation for Animal Health, \"New Infl uenza Virus\" by the European Union, \"Mexican Virus\" by South Korea and Israel, and \"Mexican fl u\" by New Zealand. In China, it was initially nominated as \"human-infected swine infl uenza,\" and \"New H1N1 infl uenza\" in Taiwan. In order to avoid misleading the public, the WHO declared on 30 April 2009 in Geneva that the nomination of \"swine infl uenza\" is terminated and the disease is renamed as \"Infl uenza A (H1N1).\" On 11 June 2009 , the WHO raised the pandemic alert level of infl uenza to Phase 6. By 21 March 2010, according to the WHO offi cial website, the laboratory confi rmed cases of infl uenza A (H1N1) had been reported from more than 213 countries and regions including at least 16,931 deaths. By 7 March 2010, according to data from China, 127,427 confi rmed cases had been reported from 31 provinces in mainland, including 8320 severe and critical cases, and 796 deaths. The death rate of the pandemic of infl uenza A (H1N1) is 0.4-6.77 %, being higher than that from common infl uenza.",

HA acts like a key to unlock the door of the host cells for the invading viruses, while NA contributes to destroy the cell receptor, which renders free transmission of the viruses in the body of the host. Both enzymes are highly variant, and the defi ned infl uenza A viruses, so far, are nominated based on different combinations of 16 types of HA (H1-16) and 9 types of NA (N1-9), such as H1N1, H1N2, H5N1, etc. Among all the subtypes, HA 1-3 can cause pandemic of human infl uenza, and H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 are common and fi xed virus phenotypes causing human infl uenza.
