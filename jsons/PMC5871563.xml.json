            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a severe respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV). The spectrum of clinical illness ranges from asymptomatic illness to a severe acute respiratory disease requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation. MERS has an overall mortality of 35% and there is no licensed or proven treatment.1 The use of immune anti-MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) plasma has been suggested as one potential therapeutic approach.2 However, it is difficult to collect sufficient anti-MERS-CoV plasma from infected patients to implement this strategy.3 The use of passive immune therapy, either in the form of direct plasma infusion or intravenous immunoglobulin, is often invoked both for emerging infectious diseases, such as Ebola virus disease,4 as well as more common diseases with high morbidity (despite the availability of antiviral therapeutics), such as severe influenza.5 However, the use of immune plasma in all of these conditions has similar constraints. Consistent production of large quantities of anti-pathogen-neutralising human plasma or immunoglobulin requires collection of plasma from convalescent or vaccinated human volunteers. The limited plasma supply restricts wide implementation of these therapeutics. One novel alternative method of manufacturing neutralising intravenous antibodies of consistently high affinity and avidity is to use the hyperimmune plasma of transchromosomic cattle, which produce highly potent and antigen-specific, fully human polyclonal IgG de novo, and which mount a robust antibody immune response after vaccination.",

We restricted the article type to clinical trials and the species to human, and there were no language restrictions. We found no articles. After removing the search restriction of title or abstract for these terms, removing the species restrictions to human beings, and excluding studies that did not assess MERS therapeutics (rather they mentioned it in the background or discussion), we found no previous publications of MERS therapeutics in human beings. Additionally, we searched for studies using the search terms (\u201cintravenous immunoglobulin\u201d OR \u201cIGIV\u201d), AND (\u201cbovine\u201d or \u201ccow\u201d), and restricted the article type to clinical trials and the species to human. After excluding studies that did not assess bovine intravenous immunoglobulin, we identified no previous publications of MERS therapeutics in humans.\nAdded value of this study\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to show the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of intravenous immunoglobulin derived from transchromosomic cattle, and the first study to describe the safety of a putative therapeutic specifically for MERS.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe evidence from this study shows that single infusions of SAB-301 up to 50 mg/kg appear to be safe and well tolerated in healthy participants, and should be considered for further investigation in the treatment of MERS.\n",

To avoid possible human\u2013bovine interspecies incompatibility between the human immunoglobulin-\u03bc-chain protein (hIgM) and bovine transmembrane \u03b1 and \u03b2 immunoglobulins (bIg\u03b1 and bIg\u03b2) in the pre-B-cell-receptor complex, the hIgM constant domain was partly replaced with the counterpart of bovine IgM (bIgM). Furthermore, the DNA regulatory elements I\u03b31 and S\u03b31 were bovinised on the human artificial chromosome to facilitate DNA\u2013protein interactions in the bovine B cell. This human artificial chromosome is designated as isKcHAC\u0394, and is transferred to bovine fibroblasts that are homozygous triple knockouts of the two bovine immunoglobulin-\u03bc heavy-chain loci (bIGHM and bIGHML1) and the bovine \u03bb light-chain locus (bIGL). The triple-knockout bovine fibroblasts carrying the human artificial chromosome were used as nuclear donors to clone transchromosomic cattle.",

For mice given 500 \u03bcg (25 mg/kg, assuming 20 g body weight for mice) of SAB-301 at 24 h post infection, MERS-CoV titres were below the level of detection at day 5 (p<0\u00b70001). When SAB-301 was administered 48 h after infection, viral titres were detectable but reduced by about 1000-fold by day 5 compared with the untreated control (p<0\u00b70001). Given that animal models of MERS-CoV challenge do not replicate human disease effectively, the relevance of this model to extrapolate human efficacy is not known. The mouse dose of 500 \u03bcg (equivalent to 25 mg/kg) equates to a human dose of approximately 2 mg/kg based on body surface area conversion. In view of the high mortality rate in people with MERS-CoV infection and the difficulties extrapolating preclinical models to human disease, we suggest the highest tolerated dose in this phase 1 trial (50 mg/kg) should be used initially in human efficacy trials.",
