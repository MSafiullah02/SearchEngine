However, these mice showed obviously improved resistance to infection with intracellular bacterial pathogen (Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium) compared with the mice with wild\u2010type B cells. Wang et al.28 have demonstrated that IL\u201035 can induce the formation of Breg cells and facilitate their conversion to a new subgroup of Breg cells that secrete IL\u201035 and IL\u201010. This study also showed that mice treated with IL\u201035 were protected from experimental autoimmune uveitis, and mice lacking IL\u201035 (p35\u2212/\u2212) or those defective in IL\u201035 signaling (IL\u201012R\u03b22\u2212/\u2212) produced endogenously fewer Breg cells or after treated with IL\u201035, resulted in severe uveitis. IL\u201035 functions as both an inducer and a mediator of Breg cells,29 it can switch off inflammation in rodent models of autoimmunity, whereas its absence in B cells enhanced their survival after infected with pathogens, indicating the potential therapeutic value of IL\u201035 targeting human autoimmune and infectious diseases.29 The two studies have now taken the investigation of IL\u201035 to a new height.",

These HCV core\u2010specific Treg cells could suppress the reporter T cells via the production of IL\u201035 and IL\u201010,81 indicating a potential ability of IL\u201035 to inhibit virus\u2010specific T cell responses that lead to persistent chronic HCV infection. Liu et al.82 have provided the first research data that IL\u201035 is detectable in circulating CD4+ T cells in chronic HBV\u2010infected patients, whereas it is undetectable in healthy controls. Liu et al. have showed that both the mRNA expression of Ebi3/p35 and the protein secretion of IL\u201035 is detectable in circulating CD4+ T cells in patients with chronic hepatitis B, suggesting that HBV could also act as an inducer for the CD4+ T cells to initiate IL\u201035 secretion.82 In a study on primary biliary cirrhosis, Tsuda et al.83 deleted the gene encoding the IL\u201012p35 subunit from dominant\u2010negative TGF\u2010\u03b2 receptor type II (dnTGF\u2010\u03b2RII) mice, which resulted in an IL\u201012p35(\u2010/\u2010) dnTGF\u03b2RII strain. They found that there was a strikingly high frequency (>50%) of liver fibrosis in the p35\u2212/\u2212 dnTGF\u2010\u03b2RII mice, suggesting a possible correlation between IL\u201035 and liver fibrosis. Wang et al.84 investigated the changes in the expression of IL\u201035 in patients with liver cirrhosis\u2010related portal hypertension complicated with esophageal variceal bleeding and splenomegaly before and after phased joint intervention (surgical intervention for treating the complications of decompensated liver cirrhosis), showing that the circulating concentrations of IL\u201035 were obviously reduced the efficient surgical intervention, and serum IL\u201035 levels were positively correlated with total bilirubin levels and international normalized ratio but was negatively correlated with albumin levels.
