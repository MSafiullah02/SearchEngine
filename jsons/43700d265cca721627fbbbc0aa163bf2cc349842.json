Increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase were found in five patients (5/8), and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in four (4/8). Total bilirubin level in all patients was normal. Creatine kinase level decreased in one patient and increased in two; patient 2 had a far higher bilirubin level (20,702 U/L) than normal (normal range: 30-170 U/L). Creatinine level decreased in three patients and increased in two patients. Two patients (2/5) had high D-dimer level. TBNK lymphocyte subset analysis revealed decreased percentage of CD16 + CD56 + lymphocytes (4/8) and Th/Ts (1/8), and increased percentage of CD3 + (2/8), CD4 + (4/8) and CD8 + (1/8) lymphocytes. Cytokine detection assays showed increased levels of IL-6 (2/8), IL-10 (5/8) and IFN-\u03b3 (2/8). ",

SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that belongs to the \u03b2-coronavirus cluster, which can cause the third known zoonotic coronavirus disease after severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [13] . It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cell entry receptor (ACE2) to infect humans, as SARS-CoV, but the clinical features of COVID-19 seem to be more variable [3] . The number of COVID-19 patients currently exceeds SARS and MERS; however, most patients are infected mildly, and the overall case-fatality rate (CFR) was 2.3% (1023 deaths among 44,672 confirmed patients) [14] , much lower than that of SARS (10%) and MERS (37%) [3, 15, 16] . In the early reports, all of the patients were adults (middle-aged and elderly) in Wuhan [5] . On entering the outbreak stage and improvement of pathogen detection, pediatric patients (even newborns) have been reported increasingly [17, 18] . According to the latest report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC), 965 confirmed patients under age 19 years (2.16%, 965/44,672) were reported nationwide [14] ; no deaths have occurred in the group aged 9 years and younger, as of February 11. Children have special immune response system which is distinct from adults [19] ; therefore, pediatric patients with COVID-19 have their own clinical features and therapeutic responses [20] . To our knowledge, this is the first report on pediatric patients with severe COVID-19.",

Half of our patients were infants or young children, who were unable to speak or speak clearly. So more data on clinical features of pediatric patients need to be studied. The ratio of patients with fever in this cohort of severe patients was lower than that of critically ill adult patients. Among the 52 critically ill adult patients reported by Yang et al. [22] , common symptoms were fever (98%), cough (77%) and dyspnoea (63.5%). Nevertheless, the ratio of patients with fever in this series was higher than those children not treated in ICU. Among the 34 infected children (most are mild patients) reported by Wang et al. [24] , fever (50%) and cough (38%) were the most common symptoms. According to our results, polypnea should be highlighted in severe pediatric patients, even without fever. Infected patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) may present with characteristic pulmonary ground-glass changes on imaging [4, 6, 12, 25] . The CT images of our patients mainly showed multiple patch-like shadows and ground glass opacity, consistent with previous reports. Chest X-rays of patient 1 who remains in ICU demonstrate decreased brightness of the lung and \"white lunglike\" changes. This patient is still under intensive treatment and close monitoring.",
