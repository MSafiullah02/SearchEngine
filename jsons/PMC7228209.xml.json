On the fourth day, he presented conjunctivitis of his left eye. A chest x\u2010ray showed an opacity compatible with right lower lobe pneumonia, and his CRP rose to 13 mg/dL. This is compatible with serious reported cases, where pneumonia appears to be the most frequent serious manifestation of infection. It is characterized primarily by fever and cough, but it is usually accompanied by dyspnea, and bilateral instead of unilateral infiltrates on chest imaging.7 This could be related to the fact that he had a normal total lymphocyte count, and that the severity of the disease has been associated with lymphopenia.8 His conjunctivitis is also an infrequent symptom, that could be explained by evidence that the virus may be present in conjunctival secretions, with around 0.8% of cases presenting with conjunctival congestion.9, 10, 11, 12, 13\n",
