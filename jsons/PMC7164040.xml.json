            "text": "Despite the renewed interest in 3D domain swapping (3D\u2010DS), partly because of its association with the aggregation mechanism of amyloidogenic proteins 1, 2, the details of the process are not known, and nor can the tendency of a protein to swap be predicted 3. According to the Eisenberg scheme 4, 3D\u2010DS is prompted by the partial opening of a monomer structure, which is followed by the association of the partially unfolded proteins: in the swapped dimer, a new contact region between the two subunits is established, defining the so\u2010called open interface, and the two dislocated regions reconstitute the previous interface (called closed). This mechanism appears to be plausible, and only the first step has been revised, because experimental data have suggested two alternative scenarios: local partial unfolding of monomers in several cases 5, but total monomer unfolding in other cases 6, 7. Following the partial unfolding scheme, the Gibbs energy balance associated with 3D\u2010DS should consist of: (a) the energy loss necessary to detach the swapping domain and unfold the hinge region, where prolines are often present 8; (b) a loss in translational entropy for dimerization; and (c) an energy gain resulting from the new interactions occurring at the open interface. On the other hand, in the total unfolding scheme, the energy loss for the first step is significantly larger, and the probability of such an event is considerably lower. However, by comparing the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of several proteins swapping under different experimental conditions, Liu and Huang recently suggested the general occurrence of total unfolding 9. They propose that this intermediate step should be necessary not only in the case of proteins requiring chemical or physical stress to swap (such as RNase A and cyanovirin\u2010N), for which global unfolding has already been suggested 6, 7, but also for the C\u2010terminal domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus main protease, for which other authors have found swapping without unfolding 5.",

Therefore, in this study we have investigated the swapping mechanism in an interesting protein representing a special case of intramolecular 3D\u2010DS. Bovine seminal ribonuclease (BS\u2010RNase) is, indeed, biosynthesized as a monomer, but it is converted into a homodimer through two disulfide bonds, between Cys31 and Cys32 of one subunit and Cys32 and Cys31, respectively, of the other subunit. The native protein is isolated as a mixture of unswapped (M=M) and swapped (M\u00d7M) isoforms, in a molar equilibrium ratio [M\u00d7M]/[M=M] of 2 : 1 10. Interestingly, the swapping induces further entangling of the BS\u2010RNase subunits, and elicits additional biological properties of the protein. BS\u2010RNase shows selective cytotoxicity for tumor cells, which is strongly related to the enzymatic activity 11. Moreover, besides the RNA hydrolytic function, other essential features that endow BS\u2010RNase with these additional properties are the ability to strongly interact with the tumor cell membranes 12, 13, which results in protein internalization via endocytosis 14, and the ability to evade the binding of RNase inhibitor 15, a protein found at high concentrations in the cytosol that strongly binds, and inhibits, most monomeric ribonucleases 16, 17. It has been proposed that this latter property depends on the swapped isoform, because it retains a dimeric structure even under the reducing cytosol conditions 18, 19, which hamper the binding by RNase inhibitor.",

Furthermore, the identical quaternary structure provides the unique opportunity to study the sole effects of the interchange of the swapping elements. In vitro, BS\u2010RNase dislocates its N\u2010terminal helices under very mild temperature and pH conditions, which necessarily involve only local unfolding. In the past, this feature has been attributed to the high flexibility of its 16\u201322 hinge region 20, 21, where a proline is present, as in most cases of 3D\u2010DS 8. However, mutagenesis studies have suggested that the hinge sequence is not responsible for the swapping process 22. Furthermore, the monomeric derivative of BS\u2010RNase (mBS) in solution behaves like a compact, globular protein, without any detectable propensity for local unfolding 23.",

            "text": "A comparison of the structural properties of the two dimeric, purified BS\u2010RNase isoforms was performed by means of NMR measurements. Swapped and unswapped conformers showed a superimposable set of resonances (Fig. 1A), indicative of a very similar structure, in line with X\u2010ray diffraction data. Comparison of backbone chemical shifts with those of mBS revealed that only a few resonances were shifted (Fig. 1A), most of them belonging to residues located in close proximity to the open interface and the hinge loop. Thus, with simple 1H/15N\u2010HSQC experiments, it was possible to monitor the swapping process by incubating the samples of the unswapped dimer at 37 \u00b0C and acquiring spectra at 25 \u00b0C (to suppress any further swapping) every 2 h over several days. Given the high degree of similarity between the NMR spectra, most signals of the two isoforms overlapped to a high degree. Nevertheless, we were able to monitor the process by following the intensity of a few peaks corresponding to residues located in different regions of the protein surface, i.e. at the open interface (Leu28), and in the \u03b2\u2010sheet region (Asp83, Lys98, and Thr99). An overlay of the respective regions in the 1H/15N\u2010HSQC spectra at different times during the swapping process is shown in Fig. 1B. The time dependence of the signal intensity, over the whole time interval explored, is shown in Fig. 1C. The peak intensities decreased in a similar manner for all of the residues, even in regions far away from the dislocating helices, indicating that the swapping process affects the local environment of the protein residues in a concerted way, but we have not used these data to try to obtain rate constant values. Furthermore, in none of the spectra did we have evidence of populated equilibrium intermediates. In addition, the hinge peptide linking the N\u2010terminal helix to the main protein body was characterized by similar conformational flexibility in both dimers, as indicated by the 1H/15N heteronuclear NOE signals (Fig. S1). On the other hand, the flexibility of this region in both dimers is smaller than in the same region in mBS, as a consequence of the interactions occurring between the side chains of hinge residues and the corresponding partner subunit 22. This result indicates that the conformational flexibility of the hinge peptide is not sufficient to account for the propensity to dislocate the N\u2010terminal helices, as it has been previously shown that, in aqueous solution, mBS behaves like a stable globular protein, without any tendency to detach the N\u2010terminal helix 23, 24. As the dimeric forms showed an increased propensity to detach the N\u2010terminal helices, a further analysis of the protein conformational fluctuations in solution was performed by comparing the early stages of urea\u2010induced denaturation and the hydrogen\u2013deuterium (H\u2013D) exchange rates of both BS\u2010RNase isoforms with those of mBS by means of NMR measurements. Figure 2A shows the effects of the addition of 1 m urea on mBS, by showing the residues whose chemical shifts were displaced more than 0.1 p.p.m. upon addition of 1 m urea, and the residues that underwent a displacement between 0.05 and 0.1 p.p.m. The same data are reported in the form of a bar\u2010graph in Fig. S2. Figure 2B,C shows the effect of the addition of 1 m urea on unswapped and swapped BS\u2010RNase. Comparison of the three panels of Fig. 2 indicates that urea accessibility was increased in both dimers with respect to mBS, as, in the presence of 1 m urea, both dimers were affected by urea addition more than mBS. The different behavior between monomer and dimers was more evident at the interface regions, at the so\u2010called deamidation loop (region 65\u201372), and at the C\u2010terminal region. In addition, the N\u2010terminal helices proved to be more accessible in the unswapped dimer than in the swapped one, in agreement with the higher conformational stability of the latter isoform, which is more abundant in solution. Furthermore, significant differences in regions crucial for swapping between monomer and dimers emerged at higher urea concentration, as shown in Fig. S3. This shows differences between the two dimers, indicating that the N\u2010terminal helices and the hinge peptides were more affected in the unswapper isoform than in the swapped isoform. Additional evidence for the increased conformational flexibility of the dimeric isoforms emerged from the H\u2013D exchange experiments. On the basis of the protection factors, calculated as described in Experimental procedures, residues were divided into three classes: slow\u2010exchanging, medium\u2010exchanging, and fast\u2010exchanging (Fig. 3). The comparison of Fig. 3A with Fig. B,C suggests a significant difference between the monomeric and dimeric isoforms. Most residues in the N\u2010terminal helix passed from the slow\u2010exchange regime in mBS (Fig. 3A) to the medium\u2010exchange regime in the swapped isoform (Fig. 3B), and even to the fast\u2010exchange regime in the unswapped isoform (Fig. 3C). Again, among the dimers, the unswapped isoform showed the highest conformational fluctuations in solution. Overall, the experimental data reported in Figs 2 and 3 suggest that dimerization increases the accessibility and the conformational flexibility of the regions playing the fundamental role in the domain swapping of BS\u2010RNase, and that, in particular, the unswapped dimer is the most plastic form in solution.",

            "text": "To complete our investigation of swapping in BS\u2010RNase, we investigated the temperature dependence of the rate of conversion of both isoforms by using a well\u2010established biochemical protocol for the quantitative evaluation of isoform amounts, which has already been used to monitor the time course of both the swapping and unswapping processes in native and recombinant BS\u2010RNase 10, 22, as well as in some mutants 22, 25. It is worth noting that, as in all other known cases of 3D\u2010DS, the isoform interconversion reactions can be studied solely over a very narrow temperature range, as indicated in Fig. S4A,B. A standard kinetic analysis allowed the evaluation of the rate constants for the two processes, on the assumption that both swapping and unswapping follow pseudo\u2010first\u2010order kinetics at the different temperatures. These rate constant values were used to construct two Arrhenius plots (Fig. S4C). Both swapping and unswapping yielded the same activation enthalpy value (99 \u00b1 12 kcal mol\u22121 and 97 \u00b1 11 kcal mol\u22121, respectively). This value corresponds, within the limits of experimental error and with a change of the sign, to twice the enthalpy change associated with the binding of the S\u2010peptide to the S\u2010protein: (a) \u2013 (43 \u00b1 2) kcal mol\u22121 at 25 \u00b0C and pH 5.0, via direct isothermal titration calorimetry measurements 26; (b) \u2013 (44 \u00b1 3) kcal mol\u22121 at 39 \u00b0C and pH 7.0, via a specific analysis of differential scanning calorimetry data for the denaturation of S\u2010peptide\u2013S\u2010protein complexes 27; and (c) \u2013 (48 \u00b1 3) kcal mol\u22121 from the kinetics of dissociation of S\u2010peptide from S\u2010protein at 30 \u00b0C and pH 6.7 28, 29. This finding indicates that: (a) the rate\u2010limiting step of both the swapping and the unswapping pathways is the detachment of the two N\u2010terminal \u03b1\u2010helices from the main body of the monomers; and (b) swapping and unswapping occur via local partial unfolding. This does appear to be plausible, because, for both isoforms, the productive kinetic intermediate should necessarily have the two N\u2010terminal helices detached, and so the magnitude of the activation enthalpy should be similar. However, the kinetics of the swapping process are markedly faster than those of the unswapping process. At 37 \u00b0C, k (M=M \u2192 M\u00d7M) = 0.186 h\u22121, whereas k (M\u00d7M \u2192M=M) = 0.041 h\u22121. This might be because the two closed interfaces in the swapped isoform are not independent of each other, because they are composed of residues belonging to both monomers, and so the probability of having both the N\u2010terminal helices detached is lower than in the unswapped isoform. It is worth recalling here that the closed interface hosts the catalytic residues of BS\u2010RNase (His12, Lys41, and His119), which, in the swapped isoform, are contributed by the two different monomers. The crosstalk between the two active sites of the swapped isoform is confirmed by the negative cooperativity characterizing its catalytic mechanism; the occupation of one active site hinders the occupation of the other active site by a substrate molecule. This should lead to a lower value of the pre\u2010exponential factor (which is related to the activation entropy) in the Arrhenius equation for the unswapping process (Fig. S4), giving an increase in the lower kinetic constant values. It should be emphasized that, at equilibrium, the swapped form is favored, having a concentration approximately twice that of the unswapped form (at 37 \u00b0C), but the standard Gibbs energy difference between the two isoforms amounts to only 0.5 kcal mol\u22121 at 25 \u00b0C (i.e. \u0394G = \u2212RT ln K). This fact cannot be explained only on a structural basis, because it implies a delicate balance of several factors, among which are the accessibility and dynamics of the solvation shell that, as suggested by the H\u2013D exchange and urea susceptibility data described above, are quite different between the two isoforms.",

This hypothesis emphasizes the role of the two interchain disulfide bridges, because the unswapped isoform may constitute a special \u2018covalent\u2019 case of an unswapped noncovalent dimer that could represent an obligatory intermediate species, even in typical (i.e. monomer\u2010to\u2010dimer) 3D\u2010DS processes.",
