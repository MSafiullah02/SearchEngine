The goal of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is to work toward long-term solutions of either voluntary repatriation or local integration into their host country. However, in some cases, the UNHCR has no other option than to permanently resettle refugees to a third country such as the United States, Australia, or Canada.1\n",

As a subset of the total immigrant population, refugees have been resettled in all but 2 states, with a large proportion going to Texas, California, New York, and Michigan (Fig. 2\n).3 In addition to the refugees who are accepted for admission before their departure from overseas, asylum seekers make up an important group of potential immigrants who apply for asylum after arrival to the United States. To receive asylum, an immigration court must determine whether the asylum seeker meets the same legal definition as a refugee. In 2013, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services granted asylum to 25,199 individuals with the largest proportion being from the People\u2019s Republic of China (34%).4\n",

Refugees receive 8 months of medical coverage, representing a window period to complete an initial health evaluation and obtain subspecialty consultation if necessary. They are also eligible to apply for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act; other immigrants must wait 5 years. The government has partnered with private voluntary agencies to assists refugees in their resettlement process with services such as orientation, food and clothing, initial housing, and sponsor programs. Voluntary agencies may also provide case management, English language classes, and vocational training. Also, in contrast to other immigrants, refugees and asylees are entitled to an accelerated path to citizenship. They can apply for a green card after the first year and for citizenship at 5 years.",

One study compared trained interpreters to ad hoc interpreters (ie, family members, hospital staff, untrained volunteers, and friends) and found significant higher error rates among ad hoc interpreters.10 In particular, using family members is problematic when it comes to discussing sensitive topics. Moreover, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Department of Health and Human Services mandate the provision of competent interpreters in all health care settings.11 Having a face-to-face interpreter is ideal but medical telephonic services are widely available, cheaper, and easier to coordinate without scheduling ahead of time.",

If negative, the clinician should proceed to screen for latent TB infection with a tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay followed by a 2-view chest radiograph. All patients diagnosed with TB must have their HIV status evaluated. The decision to offer treatment of latent TB infection is based on weighing the risks of reactivation with the risks of treatment. Estimates of these risks can be found using an online calculator, such as www.tstin3d.com from McGill University.

Chronic infection substantially increases the risk of cirrhosis, fulminant hepatitis, liver transplant, and liver cancer. Whereas the overall prevalence is relatively low in United States (0.4%), refugees have a significantly high rate of infection ranging from 5% to 14%.23, 24 The highest rates were observed in refugees from sub-Saharan Africa (10.5%) and East Asia (13%).25 The CDC recommends routine screening with serologic testing of immigrants from endemic areas.26 HBV surface antigen is the marker of on-going viral replication and warrants further evaluation to determine whether treatment is needed. Even for inactive carrier state, life-long serial monitoring for liver function and screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are necessary. HBV infection is distinct from other hepatitides such as hepatitis C virus infection in that it can lead to the development of HCC in the absence of cirrhosis. Therefore, experts recommend that patients receive a screening liver ultrasound or non\u2013maternal alpha fetoprotein test every 6 to 12 months.27\nBox 1\nshows the recommended age to begin HCC screening. It is also recommended that patients be counseled regarding transmission (eg, sexual contact and sharing razors and toothbrushes). Household contacts who are not already infected and nonimmune should be vaccinated.27\nBox 1Surveillance ultrasound every 6 to 12 months for HCC screening is recommended for the following groups of patients\nAsian men older than 40 yearsAsian women older greater than 50 yearsAll cirrhotic HBV carriersFamily history of HCCAfricans older than 20 yearsAny carrier older than 40 years with alanine aminotransferase elevation and/or HBV DNA greater than 2000 IU/mL\nData from Lok AS, McMahon BJ.

The hemoglobin A1c was 14%. Her primary care provider was frustrated because during the past year, she tried multiple times to engage the patient to reduce her portion size and lose weight.However, at an appointment with a nutritionist, the patient revealed that she lost several children to starvation during the Pol Pot era. She herself nearly starved and she recalled her desperate attempts to find food. Even now, feelings of hunger invariably bring back these painful memories.After learning this, her primary care physician and nutritionist were able to adjust their counseling approach, putting more emphasis on exercise and eating nonstarchy vegetables rather than on limiting portion sizes. During the next 2 years, the patient eventually reduced her body mass index from 30 to 28 and decreased her hemoglobin A1c to 7.8%.\n",
