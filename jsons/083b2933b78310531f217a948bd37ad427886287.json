            "text": "Our overall knowledge of the emerging COVID-19 infection and grasp of its mechanism causing coagulopathy in non-severe cases is constantly evolving. Several mechanisms have been proposed, but in the largest analysis of cases published to date of 1099 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients in China, a D-dimer \u2265 0.5 mg/Lwas noted in 46.4% of non-severe cases and 59.6% in severe cases. [2] Moreover, the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis has issued recommendations of measuring D-dimers, prothrombin time, and platelet count in all COVID-19 patients, acknowledging that guidelines may change as our knowledge evolves. [3] Interestingly, antiphospholipid antibodies (specifically anticardiolipin IgA and anti-\u03b22glycoprotein I IgA and IgG) have also been reported in severe COVID-19 infection. [4] As cited in our original paper with findings of 62 publications indexed on PubMed when \"COVID\" and \"thrombosis\" are concurrently searched at the time of this writing, COVID-19 patients have certainly been shown to exhibit a thrombophilic state. [5] Additionally, while transient LR can mimic erythema ab igne, neither of our patients had histories placing them at risk for erythema ab igne. We originally proposed that the two patients who exhibited transient LR perhaps had low-grade DIC. Although it is still a possibility, we propose expanding that hypothesis to them having had a low-grade thrombophilic or hyperviscosity state, with possible etiologies including, the formation of intravascular thrombosis, cold agglutinins, lupus anticoagulant, cryofibrinogens, or cryoglobulins. The concurrent hematuria in Patient 1 could be explained by renal microinfarctions or intravascular hemolysis. We continue to support our original statement that, at this time while the etiology for a hypercoagulable state is unknown, complete blood count, coagulation studies, fibrin degradation products, urinalysis, and tissue histopathology in patients with livedo reticularis related to COVID-19 may further clarify the pathomechanisms of this vasculopathy.",
