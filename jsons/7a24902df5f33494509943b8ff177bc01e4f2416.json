(N)-MCT was also a good inhibitor of viral DNA synthesis in both viruses and was consistent with inhibition of the viral DNA polymerase once it had been activated by the viral TK homologues. The compound was nontoxic in vivo and effectively reduced the mortality of mice infected with orthopoxviruses, as well as those infected with herpes simplex virus type 1 when treatment was initiated 24 hours after infection.

            "text": "Identified. Isoniazid (INH) is one of the most effective drugs against tuberculosis (TB), but Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium that causes TB, has found ways to resist this drug. Over the past decade, several proteins have been suggested to be the target for INH, but researchers have not been able to define exactly which one is attacked by INH and is responsible for the drug's action on the bacteria. To define whether one or more proteins are directly affected by the drug, it was important to change these targets one at a time to demonstrate which one is primarily attacked by INH. Using new molecular tools that were developed, a team of researchers introduced, for the first time, a small but defined change (mutation) in the protein InhA alone, which was thought to be the primary target for INH (6) . This small change is the same that is seen in this protein when the bacteria become resistant to INH. The bacteria with the changed protein InhA could no longer be killed with therapeutic amounts of INH. Furthermore, the altered InhA protein from Mtb was also isolated, and it was determined that it lost the ability to effectively bind to isoniazid. (7). The results obtained with the in vitro model served as the basis for the doses and the dose schedules that were evaluated in the mouse inhalational anthrax model. The effects of levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin treatment were compared with those of no treatment (untreated controls). The main outcome measure in the in vitro hollow-fiber infection model was a persistent reduction of culture density (\u22654 log 10 reduction) and prevention of the emergence of levofloxacinresistant organisms. In the mouse inhalational anthrax model, the main outcome measure was survival. The results indicated that levofloxacin given once daily with simulated human pharmacokinetics effectively sterilized Bacillus anthracis cultures. By using a simulated animal pharmacokinetic profile, a once-daily dosing regimen that provided a human-equivalent exposure failed to sterilize the cultures. Dosing regimens that \"partially humanized\" levofloxacin exposures within the constraints of animal pharmacokinetics reproduced the antimicrobial efficacy seen with human pharmacokinetics. In a mouse inhalational anthrax model, once-daily dosing was significantly inferior (survival end point) to regimens of dosing every 12 hours or every 6 hours with identical total daily levofloxacin doses. These results demonstrated the predictive value of the in vitro hollow-fiber infection model with respect to the success or the failure of treatment regimens in animals. Furthermore, the model permits the evaluation of treatment regimens that \"humanize\" antibiotic exposures in animal models, enhancing the confidence with which animal models may be used to reliably predict the efficacies of proposed antibiotic treatments in humans in situations where human trials cannot be performed (e.g., the release of pathogens as agents of bioterrorism or emerging infectious diseases). A treatment regimen effective in rhesus monkeys was identified (7).",

RNA interference (RNAi) is a recently discovered cellular mechanism in which small pieces of double-stranded RNA (small interfering RNAs, or siRNAs) suppress the expression of genes with sequence homology. A team of investigators has been able to harness RNA interference to protect laboratory animals against lethal infection with important human pathogens like the herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), West Nile virus (WNV), and the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) (8) . It was demonstrated that a single siRNA, targeting a conserved sequence present in both WNV and JEV, protected mice infected with WNV or JEV from lethal encephalitis when administered before or after infection. WNV and JEV, both mosquito-borne flaviviruses that cause acute encephalitis, are important re-emerging viruses that cause tens of thousands of infections in the world and significant morbidity and mortality. Currently, no drugs exist to treat WNV or JEV. This study supports the further development of siRNAs as a novel, broad-spectrum antiviral therapy against emerging flaviviruses.",

The sialidase fusion protein is to be applied as an inhalant to remove the influenza viral receptors, sialic acids, from the airway epithelium. Thus, a specific sialidase fusion construct, DAS181, effectively cleaved sialic acid receptors used by both human and avian influenza viruses. The treatment provided a long-lasting effect and is nontoxic to the cells. DAS181 demonstrated potent antiviral and cell protective efficacies against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of influenza A and B.
