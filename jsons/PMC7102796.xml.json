Since then, 1564 cases of MERS have been reported through the 11th of September 2015, with a fatality rate of approximately 35% [2]. The disease is caused by a novel betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family [3]. Initially, scientists suspected that the virus might be transmitted from bats [4], [5]. However, more recent studies have shown a strong link between the virus and camels [6], [7], [8]. It is now generally accepted that both species serve as natural reservoirs for this virus [9].",

Our studied population consisted mainly of Twitters users, who tend to be more educated and younger individuals in the Saudi community, and therefore, our findings are limited to this subpopulation. In addition, most of the participants were from the Central province. This limitation might be because the Central region is highly populated and includes the Capital City of Riyadh, where most of the celebrities reside. Our questionnaire did not address the source of information that the public used to become informed about MERS. Therefore, we could not determine which method is most effective in educating the Saudi public. A further limitation is not addressing the issue of the avoidance of pilgrimage and visiting crowded places, such as the Holy Mosques of Makkah and Medina. The questionnaire included a vague question on avoidance of crowded places without any further description. Another shortcoming is the lack of information on the consumption of camel products. Drinking raw camel milk and consuming camel meat are Saudi traditions. Additionally, using camel urine as an alternative medicine is still practiced by some Saudi individuals. This is of high significance, especially as more studies are linking the consumption of raw camel products with MERS-CoV infection [18].",

As the disease continues to evolve, vaccine and specific antiviral agents are urgently needed. In the meantime, promoting protective measures among the public will enhance safety and help reduce the spread of the infection. Based on the present findings, we recommend a more rigorous public awareness campaign to correct misconceptions. This can be done by addressing the public through clear television advertisements, mobile messages, and different social media modalities. Alternatively, campaigns carried out in schools, colleges, and malls can also educate the public. More essentially, site visits to camel farms by veterinary or infection control officers are important strategies for preventing MERS-CoV transmission between camels and humans. The Saudi public must be clearly instructed to avoid direct contact with camel body fluids until the eradication of the infection is made possible. In addition, the consumption of raw camel products must be avoided. More importantly, persons with frequent contact with camels should be targeted in future MERS education campaigns. The Ministry of Agriculture should find a method for educating those individuals and convincing them of the health hazard that camels pose. These health education messages should be conveyed without creating anxiety and fear in the community to avoid irrational and unnecessary demands on health services.",
