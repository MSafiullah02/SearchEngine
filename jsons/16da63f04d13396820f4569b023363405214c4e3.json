But she had no fever, cough, chest tightness, difficult breathing, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, etc. On physical examination, the lower posterior chest of both sides showed dullness on percussion and moist rales at the end of inspiration on auscultation. The white blood cell count and lymphocyte count were 10.88 \u00d7 10 9 /L and 1.04 \u00d7 10 9 /L, respectively. CT performed on February 7, 2020 revealed that both lungs were scattered with patchy ground-glass opacity. The patient was diagnosed with pulmonary contusion with thoracic spinal fracture (T12), calcaneal fracture, and pelvic fracture. On day 9 after conservative treatment, her condition was alleviated. On review of the chest CT, the previous shadows were significantly reduced.",

COVID-19 is currently a major public health emergency with obvious characteristics of human-to-human transmission and probable clustering onset, and there are infective asymptomatic carriers [4, 5] . It also can result in severe and even fatal respiratory diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome [6] . Due to its transmissibility and severity, there is possible sustained transmission of COVID-19 beyond China [7] . Early identification and proper management of patients with COVID-19 are important. Characteristics on chest computed tomography (CT), clinical features, and epidemiological history can facilitate identifying new cases of COVID-19 [8] [9] [10] .",

The hallmarks of COVID-19 infection on imaging are bilateral and peripheral GGO and consolidative pulmonary opacity, but almost 56% of early patients with COVID-19 had normal CT [14] . The features change throughout the disease course. As the disease progresses, GGOs may exist in the subpleural area of one or both lungs. Changes in CT may proceed rapidly with increased density of GGOs, and then progress into consolidations with perilobular thickening. Multifocal peripheral patchy areas of nodular consolidations and nodular GGO lesions can also be seen in subpleural areas in the lower lobes [17, 18] . Chest CT plays a vital role in early detection, observation, and evaluation of COVID-19. Increasing numbers, extent, and density of GGOs on CT indicate disease progression [16] .",

It may develop in accidental injuries such as traffic accidents, falls, bumps, and crushes, and is characterized by parenchymal hemorrhage, interstitial edema, and alveolar collapse, which potentially lead to compromised respiratory function [19] . The pathological changes of pulmonary contusion are mainly damage to lung parenchymal cells, alveolar and capillary bleeding, pulmonary interstitial edema, atelectasis, and pulmonary consolidation. Pulmonary contusion generally begins with mild interstitial edema after injury; interstitial hemorrhage occurs after 1-2 h, and becomes apparent after 4 h, subsequently with exudation of monocytes and neutrophils. Protein, red blood cells, and many inflammatory cells appear in the alveoli, and the normal alveolar structure begins to disappear. Normally, pulmonary contusion starts to be absorbed within 7-10 d, and could return to normal without leaving any traces. Therefore, according to the amount of alveolar hemorrhage, chest CT of pulmonary contusions can appear as patchy or disseminated GGO because of a large volume of alveolar blood and/or consolidation as a result of a large volume of blood in the alveoli; the edges are blurred, and the dorsal subpleural distribution is dominant.",

The increase in the extent and density of some lesions may be caused by secondary alveolar pulmonary edema, increased exudation, increased mucus, combined bacterial infection, and the beginning of mechanization. Second, some cases show successive imaging changes, that is, some lesions improve and are absorbed, and new lesions appear.

We believe that in the current epidemic of COVID-19, in the presence of strict mass prevention and control measures, special attention should be paid to trauma patients with pulmonary contusion. First, a detailed investigation of the patient's epidemiological history is required. All trauma patients should be routinely asked about their epidemiological history; if there has been any travel to areas with high incidence of COVID-19; whether there is a history of contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 pneumonia patients; and history of contact with personnel in high-incidence areas. For medical history, a detailed investigation should be carried out on whether the patient has a history of fever, cough, shortness of breath, and contact with wild animals within 2 wk before injury. At the same time, all patients with trauma should undergo routine chest CT. If COVID-19 is suspected, nucleic acid testing should be routinely performed at least twice if possible.
