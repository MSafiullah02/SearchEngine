Although SARS-CoV-2 is known to be highly transmissible when patients are most symptomatic, it is noteworthy that the incubation period can range from 0 to 24 days, therefore transmission can occur before any symptoms are apparent 14, 16 . Severe forms of this disease have a predilection for men with a mean age of 56 years with preexisting chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease or immunosuppression.

Therefore, coughing or sneezing by an infected person can render SARS-CoV-2 airborne, potentially infecting individuals in close contact (within a radius of approximately 6 ft). This led to the recent recommendation of social distancing to minimize community spread of the disease. Another important route of transmission is if droplets of SARS-CoV-2 land on inanimate objects located nearby an infected individual and are subsequently touched by other individuals 1 . Thus, disinfection of objects and handwashing are essential for halting the spread of this disease. This recommendation is strengthened considering that people touch their face on an average of 23 times per hour, with 44% of these occurrences involving the mucous membranes of the mouth and/or nose 17 . In addition, studies have shown the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in both saliva and feces of the affected patients 18, 19 . It is known that SARS-CoV-2 can bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, which are highly concentrated in salivary glands; this may be a possible explanation for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in secretory saliva 20, 21 . Therefore, there is a potential for transmission of COVID-19 via aerosol, fomites, or the fecal-oral route that may contribute to nosocomial spread in the dental office setting 22 .",

As presented in this review, further precautions are necessary that includes careful prescreening of patients and additional measures if treatment of patients with confirmed COVID-19 is deemed necessary. The latest update (March 16, 2020) by the American Dental Association recommends dentists nationwide to defer elective dental treatment for the next three weeks and focus on emergency care 32 . As there is a surge in the number of COVID-19 cases, it is quite possible that this deferment might be extended. Therefore, in order to help dentists during this period, we have put together a set of recommendations for management of dental emergencies (Fig. 7) . It is advisable to assess the emergencies on a case-by-case basis and use clinical judgement to aid in decision making.",

Thus, every patient should be considered as potentially infected by this virus, and all dental practices need to review their infection control policies, engineering controls, and supplies.

Thus, it is important to make informed clinical decisions and educate the public to prevent panic while promoting the health and well-being of our patients during these challenging times.
