The survival of trichomonads can be prolonged by adding 3 mL of 0.9% saline to 2 g of feces. A small amount of feces (size of a match head) is placed on a warm slide and a drop of 0.9% saline is mixed with the feces. Alternatively, a miniscule amount of fresh feces can be collected by insertion of a cotton-tipped swab into the rectum. The smear must not be too thick because trophozoites will be missed easily. A simple rule of thumb is that the observer should be able to read the fine newsprint of a newspaper through the smear.",

The sensitivity of direct fecal smear examination for diagnosis of T. blagburni is relatively low in cats with spontaneous disease (14%).17 In addition, the trophozoites of T. blagburni can be very difficult to distinguish from those of nonpathogenic intestinal trichomonads such as Pentatrichomonas hominis in the absence of fixation and staining. T. blagburni should also be distinguished from Giardia spp. Giardia trophozoites have a concave ventral disc and motility that mimics a falling leaf. In contrast, trichomonads are spindle shaped, have an undulating membrane that courses the entire length of the body, and move in a more irregular and jerky fashion. In contrast to Giardia spp., trichomonads do not have a cyst stage, which underscores the limitations of the fecal flotation technique for diagnosis of trichomoniasis. Trichomonads will not survive refrigeration and are rarely found in formed fecal specimens.",

The InPouch should be incubated at room temperature in an upright position in the dark and examined every 48 hours for up to 10 days for motile trophozoites with use of a 20\u00d7 or 40\u00d7 objective (Figure 1-2\n). Incubation of the InPouch at 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F) for 24 hours before incubation at room temperature can facilitate an earlier diagnosis because the warmer temperature is more conducive to replication of the trophozoites. Before microscopic evaluation, it is easiest to place the pouch in a plastic clamp provided by the manufacturer that facilitates mounting the pouch onto the stage of a light microscope. Possible reasons for negative fecal culture results include the use of old, desiccated, nondiarrheic, or refrigerated feces in which trophozoites are unlikely to survive; the use of bacteriostatic lubricant to collect the feces; or the placement of excessive feces in the InPouch resulting in overgrowth of bacteria or yeast in the culture medium.",

Current laboratory protocols for detection of Cryptosporidium oocysts in fecal specimens include microscopic examination of smears stained with Giemsa stain, the modified Ziehl-Neelson (ZN) technique (Figure 1-4\n), the modified Kinyoun acid-fast technique, or an immunofluorescent detection procedure (Figure 1-5\n).37, 38 Immunofluorescent detection procedures are more sensitive and specific than acid-fast stains and are generally the method of choice for morphological diagnosis in human beings.39 Microscopic techniques work well when clinical signs are present and oocyst numbers are relatively high; however, once clinical signs abate and oocyst numbers are greatly decreased, the sensitivity of tests relying on morphological identification is reduced and diagnosis often requires examination of multiple fecal specimens. In these cases, the newer enzyme immunoassays designed to detect Cryptosporidium antigens in feces have proven more sensitive.40 Difficulties in detection and enumeration of oocysts in fecal specimens are compounded by variation in consistency among individual fecal specimens, the amount of specimen used, and oocyst losses incurred during recovery processes. Real-time PCR for diagnosis of Cryptosporidium spp. infection is readily available in large reference laboratories, and studies utilizing this diagnostic modality have demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. in infected cats compared with microscopic evaluation and immunoassay methods.6\n",

In addition, the test does not rely upon morphological identification of cysts via microscopy, which saves technician time and potentially avoids false-negative interpretations. The ELISA tests also can detect GCWP 1 in the absence of detectable cysts.48 However, the SNAP Giardia Test (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, Maine) is the only commercially available Giardia ELISA assay approved for patient-side testing of giardiasis in dogs and cats.

The test has the added advantages of simplicity, rapid availability of results (8 minutes after mixing of the conjugate solution with feces), and low cost. However, such Giardia antigen assays should be supplemental tests because they only detect Giardia spp. and should not replace fecal flotation and wet mount examination to detect a wide variety of intestinal parasites, including Giardia spp. In addition, the Giardia antigen test is best used as a baseline supplemental test to diagnose new infections in animals and should not be used to assess efficacy of therapy because antigen can persist for up to 4 weeks or longer in the absence of Giardia cysts.",

The urea breath test is the most reliable noninvasive test for Helicobacter pylori infection in humans and has been used in natural and experimental animal Helicobacter infections.72 Four of 6 cats in group 2 and all the cats in groups 3 and 4 had a negative result for the urea breath test.

Cats can become persistently infected and continuously or intermittently shed virus with the feces. They generally remain healthy despite systemic infection, indicating that healthy FECV carriers play a key role in the epidemiology of FIP. Feline enteric coronavirus is generally regarded as the avirulent pathotype of FCoV and in older cats oral FECV infection only leads to mild, nonspecific clinical signs such as transient anorexia. However, in young kittens after waning of maternal antibodies, oral FECV infection can induce severe enteritis. There have also been reports of fatal coronavirus enteritis in naturally infected juvenile and adult cats. Affected cats presented with catarrhal to hemorrhagic enteritis, and immunohistopathology confirmed that the virus infected the fully differentiated villous epithelial cells.85 Infected cats can seroconvert and test positive on FCoV serological testing. Feline coronavirus is commonly detected in healthy and diarrheic cats with a prevalence ranging from 36% to 75%.6, 7 Interpretation of positive FCoV serological or PCR-based test results must be made cautiously because most cats that are infected with FECV have mild clinical signs, unless the animal is coinfected with other enteropathogens. There is no specific treatment for coronaviral enteritis in cats; treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

Animal shelter veterinarians should select fecal tests for FPV detection that have high sensitivity for FPV and low frequency of vaccine-related test interference.

Fecal PCR assays for Giardia can have false-negative results because of PCR inhibitors in feces, and PCR should not be used as a screening procedure for this organism. Large commercial reference laboratories that routinely perform PCR have incorporated a number of controls to ensure quality at each step in the process: quantitative DNA/RNA controls to assess the quality of each clinical sample; extraction controls for every DNA/RNA extraction cycle to ensure the absence of contamination; and internal positive and negative controls to verify each real-time PCR test for optimal performance and the absence of contamination. The primary indication for Giardia spp. PCR is for determining whether the infective species is a zoonotic assemblage. The latter assay can be performed at the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Colorado State University (http://dLab.colostate.edu/). This PCR test is different from the RealPCR Feline Diarrhea Panel (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, Maine) or the FastPanel PCR Feline GI Profile Panel (Antech Diagnostics, Irvine, California) performed at commercial reference laboratories. PCR can be used to diagnose Cryptosporidium spp. in kittens; however, the author prefers using a DFA test that allows direct visualization of oocysts under a fluorescent microscope. Detection of C. felis and C. canis do not always prove that the agent is the cause of the clinical disease. Fecal PCR testing is recommended for the diagnosis of T. blagburni infection in cats; however, DNA of T. blagburni can be detected in healthy carrier cats and so positive results must be interpreted in the context of the animal's history, physical examination findings, and environment. Polymerase chain reaction is a sensitive method for detecting DNA of Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp., but positive results do not inherently necessitate antimicrobial therapy as discussed previously. In cats, the positive predictive value of Clostridium spp. PCR assays on feces is low, and should best be combined with toxin immunoassays to increase the diagnostic yield. Reverse transcriptase\u2013PCR is used to detect coronavirus RNA in feces; however, positive test results do not differentiate FIP-inducing strains from FECV, and the prevalence of coronavirus in healthy, nondiarrheic cats is high.",

The stress of changing the kitten's environment can exacerbate the diarrhea. The author deworms kittens with simple diarrhea routinely using a broad-spectrum anthel\u00adminthic (e.g., fenbendazole) even in the face of a negative fecal flotation or negative Giardia ELISA. Metronidazole administration at 10 to 15 mg/kg PO every 12 hours for 5 to 7 days often is associated with partial to complete amelioration of diarrhea, possibly because of altering the intestinal microbiota, dampening cell-mediated immunity, or activity against a specific pathogen such as C. difficile or C. perfringens. Dietary modification should be considered in kittens that fail to respond to empirical antiparasitic therapy and metronidazole administration. One can temporarily dilute the milk replacer with an oral electrolyte solution such as Pedialyte (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois) to facilitate acclimation to the formula.

Metronidazole administered for 5 to 7 days should effectively treat C. perfringens and C. difficile, and kittens infected with C. jejuni and showing evidence of systemic clinical signs should be managed with a macrolide antibiotic such as azithromycin at 7 to 10 mg/kg PO every 12 hours for 10 days. Fecal PCR testing can also detect DNA of C. felis, and kittens infected with this protozoan can be treated with azithromycin at the same dose.",

Kittens with chronic ileitis could have secondary deficiencies of vitamin B12 (cobalamin), an important micronutrient for DNA replication in the intestinal crypts. Vitamin B12 can be administered empirically to kittens at 100 \u00b5g per kitten, given SC once weekly for 6 weeks. Repeat injections should be based on determination of serum cobalamin concentrations. Cobalamin is safe, easy to administer, and inexpensive.",
