It causes an economically important disease, resulting in an estimated $560 million loss per year to the swine industry in the United States (Neumann et al., 2005). PRRSV is known to inhibit the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) in infected pigs (Albina et al., 1998, Buddaert et al., 1998). IFNs are not detectable in the lungs of pigs, in which PRRSV actively replicates. PRRSV-infected pigs develop delayed and low titer neutralizing antibodies (Labarque et al., 2000) and weak cell-mediated immune responses (Xiao et al., 2004). Suppression of innate immunity may be an important contributing factor to PRRSV modulation of host immune responses.",

The innate immune system is activated after cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRR) sense pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of invading pathogens. Host PRRs for RNA viruses include Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs). Activation of the TLR or RLR pathways eventually leads to the secretion of type I IFNs. The binding of type I IFNs to their receptors activates the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, which induces expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and results in the establishment of an antiviral state (Darnell et al., 1994, Schindler and Darnell, 1995, Stark et al., 1998).",

A scrambled control PPMO CP1 was included as a negative control. An indirect immunofluorescence assay showed that 5UP1 blocked A2MC2 replication in MARC-145 cells (Fig. 1C), while CP1 had no effect. The lysate of A2MC2-infected MARC-145 cells was used for Western blot analysis with pig antiserum against PRRSV. Lysate samples of VR-2385- and MLV-infected cells were included as controls. Blotting results showed that A2MC2-infected cells had a band profile similar to MLV, though the bands were at a weaker intensity (Fig. 1D). The difference in band pattern between VR-2385 and MLV is likely because there is a deletion in nsp2 of VR-2385 (Ni et al., 2011). These results confirmed that A2MC2 was a strain of PRRSV.

STAT1 and STAT2 proteins are key players in JAK-STAT signaling, a pathway activated by type I IFNs (Darnell et al., 1994, Schindler and Darnell, 1995, Stark et al., 1998). Phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 is an early step in the pathway after IFNs bind to their receptors. To determine if A2MC2-induced IFNs resulted in the activation of these two proteins, we tested the phosphorylation status of STAT1 and STAT2 in MARC-145 cells at 0, 9, 16 and 24 hpi. The selection of 9 hpi was based on the speculation that after increase of IFN-\u03b2 transcript at 8 hpi, phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 would be detected. The inclusion of 16 and 24 hpi was based on the speculation that along with the increase of IFN-\u03b2 expression, phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 would continue. The result showed that the levels of phosphorylated STAT1 at tyrosine 701 (STAT1-Y701) and STAT2 at tyrosine 690 (STAT2-Y690) were greatly increased at 9 hpi (Fig. 6C), indicating A2MC2-induced IFNs led to the activation of STAT1 and STAT2. Moreover, the total STAT2 and ISG56 were detectable at 9 hpi and increased at 16 and 24 hpi (Fig. 6C). This result suggested that A2MC2-induced IFNs resulted in the activation of JAK\u2013STAT signaling, which then led to the increased expression of STAT2 and ISG56.",

Vero cells are defective in IFN production and not susceptible to PRRSV. Pretreatment of the cells with dilutions of A2MC2-derived supernatant induced an antiviral response in Vero cells that inhibited the replication of NDV.

Virus replication was essential for the elevation of the two proteins because UV-inactivated virus and PPMO inhibition of PRRSV replication did not lead to elevation of these host proteins. The results suggested that viral replication in the cytoplasm stimulated PRRs, leading to IFN synthesis. The elevation of the transcripts of ISG15 and ISG56 further confirmed the observation. This result also ruled out the possibility of contamination by other swine pathogens because PPMO-mediated inhibition of A2MC2 led to an absence of IFN induction. Other common swine pathogens, such as porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) or swine influenza virus (SwIV), can induce synthesis of a high level bioactive IFN-\u03b1 (Van Reeth et al., 1999). Interestingly, A2MC2 infection at different MOIs induced variable levels of ISG expression. The higher the MOI, the earlier A2MC2 induced ISG elevation. The lower the MOI, the later the virus-induced ISG expression and the lower level of induction. This result provided an explanation as to why an MOI of 1 TCID50 per cell led to a lower virus yield than MOIs of 0.1 and 0.01 TCID50. It indicates that the inoculum of 0.01 TCID50 per cell resulted in limited initial virus replication, leading to a weaker stimulation on cellular PRRs, which allowed the virus to complete its replication cycles. On the other hand, the inoculum at 1 TCID50 per cell stimulated a more robust response in regards to PRRs and IFN synthesis, which in turn inhibited virus spread to neighboring cells or continued replication.",

It was possible that there were other subtypes of type I IFNs in the supernatant from A2MC2-infected cells, as IFN-\u03b2 mRNA level significantly increased. We further tested IFN production in A2MC2 infection of PAM cells. The STAT2 and IFI56 were elevated in A2MC2-infected cells, but not in VR-2385-infected cells. The A2MC2 induction of IFNs was pig-independent as PAMs isolated from three other pigs had similar elevations of STAT2 after A2MC2 infection.

The plaque morphology of A2MC2 was much smaller than that of MLV, which indicated that MLV replicated with faster kinetics than A2MC2 in MARC-145 cells. In addition, A2MC2 infection did not lead to any observable cytopathic effect in PAM cells, and A2MC2-infected cells were of similar viability as mock-infected or MLV-infected cells.

Activation of either the TLR or the RLR pathway leads to the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), followed by its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of type I IFNs. We tested if A2MC2 replication led to IRF-3 phosphorylation using polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), as a positive control. The phosphorylated IRF-3 was detected in the poly(I:C)-treated cells but undetectable in cells infected with A2MC2 (data not shown). The result that A2MC2 infection led to increase of IFN-\u03b2 transcript from 8 hpi to less than 1000-fold at 24 hpi (Fig. 6) indicated that A2MC2 replication might lead to a low level of IRF-3 signaling for an extended period. The reason for this conjecture is that poly(I:C) treatment led to over a 10,000-fold induction of IFN-\u03b2 transcript with a peak at 6 h after treatment (data not shown). The continuous detection of phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT2 in A2MC2-infected MARC-145 cells from 9 to 24 hpi supports this speculation, while stimulation with external IFN-\u03b1 leads to transient increase of phosphorylation of STAT1 that was reduced below the detection level after 2.5 h treatment (Patel et al., 2010).",
