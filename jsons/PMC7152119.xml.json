There has been an increasing interest in the use of specific antibodies to viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic antigens in the detection and identification of the causative agents in many infectious diseases. Coons and associates were the first to use a specific antibody to detect a microbial antigen to detect pneumococcal antigen in tissues.8 The advantages of IHC over conventional staining methods (Table 3.1\n) and the contributions of IHC in infectious diseases (Table 3.2\n) are substantial. In many instances, IHC has shown high specificity, allowing the differentiation of morphologically similar microorganisms.9 Immunohistochemistry is especially useful when microorganisms are difficult to identify by routine or special stains, are fastidious to grow, or exhibit atypical morphology (Table 3.3\n).10., 11., 12., 13., 14. It is important to understand that there may be widespread occurrence of common antigens among bacteria and pathogenic fungi, and both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies must be tested for possible cross-reactivity with other organisms.15 Finally, it is important to emphasize that IHC has several steps, and that all of them can affect the final result; however, in general the only limitations are the availability of specific antibodies and the preservation of epitopes.16\n",

In many instances, the morphologic changes induced by hepatitis B virus in hepatocytes are not typical enough to render a presumptive diagnosis of hepatitis B viral infection. In other instances, there may be so little hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) that it cannot be demonstrated by techniques such as orcein staining. In these cases, immunohistochemical techniques to detect HBsAg are more sensitive than histochemical methods and are helpful in reaching a diagnosis.20 Immunostaining for HBsAg has been used in the diagnosis of hepatitis B and in the study of carrier states.21., 22. Eighty percent or more of cases with positive serologic results for HBsAg demonstrate cytoplasmic HBsAg using IHC.23 By immunoperoxidase localization, hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) can be demonstrated within the nuclei or the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, or both. Cytoplasmic expression of HBcAg usually is associated with a higher grade of hepatitis activity,23 and diffuse immunostaining of nuclei for HBcAg generally suggests uncontrolled viral replication in the setting of immunosuppression.24 Immunostaining for HBsAg and HBcAg is useful in the diagnosis of recurrent hepatitis B infection in liver allografts, particularly when present with atypical histopathologic features.25\n",

Diagnosis of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma may be problematic because of its broad morphologic spectrum and similar appearance to other benign and malignant neoplastic vascular lesions. Immunostaining of latent associated nuclear antigen-1 (LANA-1) is useful to confirm the diagnosis of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, particularly when difficult early lesions closely resemble the appearance of interstitial granuloma annulare and when the neoplasm presents in an unusual location. Immunostaining also allows distinction of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma from several morphologically similar vasoproliferative lesions.39., 40., 41. Immunostaining is restricted to the nuclei of spindle cells and endothelial cells of the slitlike vascular spaces (Fig. 3.2\n). Immunohistochemistry has also demonstrated expression of HHV-8 LANA-1 in mesothelial cells of HIV-associated recurrent pleural effusions.42\n",

Histologic diagnosis of CMV in fixed tissues usually rests on identifying characteristic cytopathic effects including intranuclear inclusions, cytoplasmic inclusions, or both. However, histologic examination lacks sensitivity, and in some cases atypical cytopathic features can be confused with reactive or degenerative changes.46 Additionally, up to 38% of patients with gastrointestinal CMV disease fail to demonstrate any inclusions.47 In these cases, IHC using monoclonal antibodies against early and late CMV antigens allows the detection of CMV antigens in the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 3.3\n). The sensitivity of IHC for detecting CMV infection ranges from 78% to 93%.47., 48. In addition, IHC may allow detection of CMV antigens early in the course of the disease when cytopathic changes have not yet developed.49., 50., 51., 52., 53., 54. For example, CMV early nuclear antigen is expressed 9 to 96 hours after cellular infection and indicates early active viral replication. Immunohistochemistry has been used to detect CMV infection in patients with steroid refractory ulcerative colitis, and the routine use of IHC for the detection of CMV in the evaluation of these patients is now recommended.55., 56. CMV immunostaining has been used to detect occult CMV infection of the central nervous system in liver transplant patients who develop neurologic complications.57 It has also been used to demonstrate a high frequency of CMV antigens in tissues from first-trimester abortions.58 CMV is the most common opportunistic organism found in liver biopsies from transplant patients; nonetheless, the incidence of CMV hepatitis appears to be decreasing owing to better prophylactic treatments.59 Although CMV hepatitis presents with characteristic neutrophilic aggregates within the liver parenchyma, atypical features suggestive of acute rejection or changes indistinguishable from those of any other viral hepatitis are occasionally observed.60 In addition, parenchymal neutrophilic microabscesses have been described in cases with no evidence of CMV infection.61 In these cases, immunostaining for CMV antigens is most useful in determining the diagnosis of CMV infection.62\n",

Rarely adenovirus infection has been described in HIV-infected patients.69., 70., 71. Characteristic adenovirus inclusions are amphophilic, intranuclear, homogeneous, and glassy. However, in some cases, the infection may contain only rare cells showing the characteristic cytopathic effect.70 In addition, other viral inclusions, including CMV, human papillomavirus (HPV), HSV, and VZV, can be mistaken for adenovirus inclusions and vice versa. In these circumstances, immunohistochemical assay may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis. A monoclonal antibody that is reactive with all 41 serotypes of adenovirus has been used in an immunohistochemical technique to demonstrate intranuclear adenoviral antigen in immunocompromised patients (Fig. 3.5\n).70., 71., 72., 73., 74. Histologic diagnosis of adenovirus colitis is difficult, and it is usually underdiagnosed. Moreover, in immunosuppressed patients, the incidence of coinfection with other viruses is high, and the presence of adenovirus tends to be overlooked. Immunohistochemical staining has been of value in differentiating adenovirus colitis from CMV colitis.70., 75.\n",

In immunocompromised patients, the infection reactivates and spreads to other organs. BK virus nephropathy is an important cause of graft failure in patients with a renal transplant,96 with a prevalence varying from 2% to 4.5% in different transplant centers.96., 97. Since specific clinical signs and symptoms are lacking in BK virus nephropathy, the diagnosis can only be made histologically in a graft biopsy.98 In the kidney, the infection is associated with mononuclear interstitial inflammatory infiltrates and tubular atrophy, findings that can be difficult to distinguish from acute rejection.98 The cytopathic changes observed in BK virus infection are not pathognomonic and can be observed in other viral infections. Moreover, in early BK virus infection there are minimal or no histologic changes, although IHC can identify viral antigen.99., 100. In this setting, IHC with an antibody against the large T antigen of SV40 virus has been effective in demonstrating BK virus infection (Fig. 3.10\n).96., 99., 101., 102., 103.\n",

Conventional histochemical methods such as silver stains are more sensitive than hematoxylin and eosin in detecting H. pylori. Nonetheless, for detecting scant numbers of organisms, it has been proven that IHC has high specificity and sensitivity, is less expensive when all factors are considered, is superior to conventional histochemical methods, and has a low interobserver variation (Fig. 3.14\n).127 Treatment for chronic active gastritis and H. pylori infection can change the shape of the microorganism. This can make it difficult to identify and differentiate the organism from extracellular debris or mucin globules. In these cases IHC improves the rate of successful identification of the bacteria, even when histologic examination and cultures are falsely negative.129., 130., 131., 132.\n",

Nevertheless, AFB staining has a low sensitivity, and it is not specific because it does not differentiate mycobacterial species.158 Furthermore, cultures may take several weeks, and sensitivity is low in paucibacillary lesions.159 In the histologic diagnosis of mycobacterial infections, IHC with anti-BCG polyclonal antibody has shown better sensitivity than AFB staining. However, in paucibacillary lesions it is inferior to AFB staining and cannot differentiate between M. tuberculosis and other mycobacteria.160 Recently a polyclonal antibody against the M. tuberculosis\u2013secreted antigen MPT64 was used in cases of mycobacterial lymphadenitis. This method showed 90% sensitivity and 83% specificity and performed better than AFB staining in cases of paucibacillary disease and comparably to nested PCR.161\n",

In addition, IHC allows pathologists to correlate microbiological and histologic findings of fungal infections and to distinguish them from harmless colonization. Immunohistochemistry can also be helpful when more than one fungus is present; in these cases dual immunostaining techniques can highlight the different fungal species present in the tissue.196 An important limitation of IHC in the identification of fungi is the well-known, widespread occurrence of common antigens among pathogenic fungi that frequently results in cross-reactivity with polyclonal antibodies and even with some monoclonal antibodies.193., 195., 196., 197. Therefore, assessing cross-reactivity using a panel of fungi is a very important step in the evaluation of immunohistochemical methods.193., 194.\n",

The clinical picture is variable and non-specific. It can range from subclinical infection to flaccid paralysis and encephalitis characterized morphologically by perivascular mononuclear cell inflammatory infiltrates, neuronal necrosis, edema, and microglial nodules, particularly prominent in the brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord.247., 248., 249., 250., 251. The diagnosis of WNV encephalitis is usually established by identifying virus-specific IgM in CSF and/or serum and by demonstrating viral RNA in serum, CSF, or other tissue.252 Immunostaining with monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies has been successfully used to diagnose WNV infection in immunocompromised patients with an inadequate antibody response (Fig. 3.22\n).248\n",

The application of molecular probes to the study and diagnosis of infectious diseases is a great adjunct to IHC as a diagnostic method and often allows for even more rapid and specific identification of organisms.303., 304., 305., 306., 307., 308., 309. Along with rapid advances in molecular diagnostic techniques, there has been an increased interest in the use of paraffin-embedded specimens for nucleic acid hybridization assays. The two main hybridization formats used in the diagnostic pathology laboratory for the diagnosis of infectious diseases are ISH and PCR. In situ hybridization is analogous to IHC in that it allows the cellular identification and localization of microbial pathogens. Instead of microbial antigens, the targets of ISH are specific RNA or DNA sequences. Many viruses (FIGURE 3.30, FIGURE 3.31, FIGURE 3.32, FIGURE 3.33\n), bacteria (Fig. 3.34\n), and other microorganisms can be localized in tissues by ISH; these include Epstein-Barr virus, HPV (Fig. 3.35\n), polyomaviruses (Fig. 3.36\n), Mycobacterium leprae, Legionella, Haemophilus influenzae, zygomycetes, and Aspergillus.\n108., 114., 207., 261., 282., 310., 311., 312., 313., 314., 315., 316., 317., 318., 319., 320., 321., 322., 323., 324., 325., 326., 327., 328., 329., 330., 331., 332. PCR has the advantage of increased sensitivity, minimal tissue requirements, and potential sequencing of the amplified product for specific identification of the microbial genotype or strain of the agent involved. There are PCR assays for most microorganisms that have been or can be adapted for use on formalin-fixed tissues.11., 124., 172., 293., 333., 334., 335., 336., 337., 338., 339., 340., 341., 342., 343., 344., 345.\n",
