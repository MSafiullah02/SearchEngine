The genetic correlation estimates for\nBRD incidence with weaning BW and birth BW were low (\u22120.02 \u00b1 0.32 and 0.07 \u00b1 0.27,\nrespectively). However, slightly greater genetic correlation estimates were obtained for\nthe number of BRD treatments with weaning BW and birth BW (0.25 \u00b1 0.35 and 0.30 \u00b1 0.27,\nrespectively). These estimates of genetic correlations between number of BRD treatments\nand BW traits may have implications for selection decisions. Selection for reduced birth\nBW is favorable for reduced number of treatments; however, selection for increased weaning\nweights may lead to an increased number of treatments for BRD in preweaned calves.",
