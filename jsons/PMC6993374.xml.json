In this order, the virus family Bornaviridae has been growing remarkably during recent years due to the discovery of several new species and genera. As of 2019, the taxonomy comprises three genera: Carbovirus, Cultervirus and Orthobornavirus [2]. Of the genus Orthobornavirus, two species, Mammalian 1 orthobornavirus and Mammalian 2 orthobornavirus, are known to affect mammals. Belonging to Mammalian 1 orthobornavirus, Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1) is still the most prevalent bornavirus in mammals. BoDV-1 is well known to cause severe and fatal neurological Borna disease in a variety of mammals, mainly horses and sheep. Recently BoDV-1 was identified as causal agent in fatal human encephalitis cases [3, 4]. This underlines the need to unravel potential sources of infection in order to prevent further animal and human cases, especially since no curative therapy or vaccination exists [3, 4].",

Phylogeny of BoDV-1 isolates reflects their geographical origin and respective endemic regions regardless of the host species they have been isolated from [5]. The endemic character, strong conservation of the viral genome and seasonal occurrence of the disease already pointed to a potential wildlife reservoir [7]. As the sequences of BD cases from neighbouring locations are particularly stable even over years, this wildlife reservoir was assumed to be territorially bound [5]. In several of the endemic areas, the bicolored white-toothed shrew (Crocidura leucodon), belonging to the order of Eulipotyphla, has been identified as natural reservoir of BoDV-1 [6, 8, 9]. However, beside the bicolored white-toothed shrew, no other reservoir, neither Eulipotyphla nor rodent, has been found yet. Bank voles have been experimentally proven to be susceptible to BoDV-1 [10] and serum antibodies against bornaviruses have been detected in free ranging bank voles [11]. Nevertheless, there is no evidence for naturally infected bank voles in endemic areas to date. Serological data have shown that several other free ranging small mammals, mostly belonging to the order of Rodentia, can also exhibit serum antibodies against Bornaviridae, but without any other evidence of BoDV-1-infection [9]. Only bicolored white-toothed shrews display a disseminated virus distribution and harbour BoDV-1 in excretory and secretory organs [9, 12] and shed infectious virus which suggests that they can transmit BoDV-1 [13].",

            "text": "Although several rodents and other small mammals are known as important reservoirs for many viruses, bats (order: Chiroptera) represent the vast majority of identified natural reservoirs of several virus families/species to date [1, 14]. For example, bats are known reservoirs for a growing list of RNA viruses, including rabies virus and other lyssaviruses, henipaviruses, coronaviruses and ebola virus [15]. Virus infections in bats follow the typical pattern of reservoirs with a persistent course lacking clinical disease [1, 16]. Several biological characteristics including gregariousness with large colonies, seasonal migrating and long life span make bats suitable to carry and spread viruses [16]. Seasonal migrating and wide hunting territories of bats can lead to wide distribution of harboured viruses [1], however, shedding in pulses and additional local factors can lead to local transmission events [16]. In Europe, 35 bat species from the order Chiroptera can be found [17]. These European bats share the same biological characteristics, but transmission events of zoonotic viruses are rare due to smaller dimensions of populations and colonies [18]. In Germany, 25 bat species can be encountered from the family Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae [19]. They include common native species, such as members of the genera Pipistrellus, Myotis and Vespertilio, and some seriously endangered species like Rhinolophus hipposideros, Myotis emarginatus and Barbastella barbastellus [19]. Several bat species, for example Myotis natteri, use roosts in barns and stables [20], which facilitates the possibility of virus transmission to livestock [18].",

In some bat species, transcription of EBL similar to the bornaviral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase has been reported [22]. Further analysis of these EBL strongly hint at ancestral and repeated contact between bats and bornaviruses during their evolution at least 11,8 million years ago [23, 26]. The function of these EBL is still discussed and an immunological benefit in the interaction with bornaviruses has been suggested in some mammalian species [22, 27]. As the retaining of the expressed EBL in the bat genome despite evolutionary selection requires resources, a benefit of the EBL and regular encounters between bornaviruses and bats during evolution seem plausible [22].",

PCR was performed with MyTaq HSMix (Bioline) under manufacturer\u2019s standard condition with degenerated primers (Additional file 2: Table S1) [29].

As internal control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase-(GAPDH)-amplification (402 bp) was included.

Lengths of amplicons were visualized with gel electrophoresis (2% agarose gel with 3% Midori Green (Biozym)) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions and commercial Sanger sequencing of orthobornaviral amplicons was performed for positive controls (GATC, Eurofins Genomics).

Although the bicolored white-toothed shrew has been identified as indigenous reservoir of BoDV-1, other potential reservoirs or animal carriers are still unknown so that further investigations of small mammals including bat species are urgently needed. Bats have already been discovered as reservoir of emerging and highly pathogenic viruses. Many factors, such as their gregarious way of life, can facilitate pathogen transmission to other bats and virus persistence in the population. In European bats, only few zoonotic viruses have been discovered [18, 33, 34] and the overall hazard for humans is comparably low [18]. As some bats take roosts in barns and stables [20] and bat carcasses are found in close proximity to agriculture [35], a risk of sporadic transmission events to livestock animals can be assumed if viruses can be detected. Animal movement across borders of endemic regions during hunting and migration of bats seems to contradict stable geographical clustering of BoDV-1 isolates and the hypothesis of a territorially bound reservoir [5]. Nonetheless, consistent usage of the same roosts as summer or winter quarter may support observed clustering and could facilitate rare endemic transmission. Additionally, the molecular evidence for co-evolution of bats and bornaviruses [22, 27] could suggest the possibility of infections of other potentially so far unknown bornaviruses beside the tested orthobornaviruses. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the possible role of bats as carrier and reservoir of orthobornaviruses such as BoDV-1 as one of the most common virus.",

However, in several other animals similar reactions were detected applying unrelated polyclonal antibodies produced in rabbits and unspecific rabbit serum. Moreover, the staining pattern is rather untypical for BoDV-1 but occurs regularly in avian bornavirus infections [30]. The immunohistochemical reaction was not observed using a monoclonal antibody against the nucleoprotein of BoDV-1. It was observed in one animal using a polyclonal antibody against the nucleoprotein of BoDV-1 and in two animals using polyclonal antibodies against proteins of variegated squirrel bornavirus-1. Thus, an infection with another, so far unknown bornavirus could not completely be excluded and has to be investigated in further studies. Scarcity and limited quality of material impeded further immunohistochemical and molecular investigations. As endogenous bornaviral elements similar to bornaviral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase have been found in bats [22], a translated endogenous element could also have been detected by immunohistochemistry due to cross-reactivity. However, an endogenous bornaviral-phosphoprotein-like protein has not been found yet and some authors have discussed a deleterious effect of endogenization of bornaviral phosphoprotein [38]. On the contrary, an endogenous bornaviral-P-like protein might also help prevent against bornavirus infection as the bornaviral polymerase is inhibited by a disturbed nucleoprotein-phosphoprotein-ration [39].",
