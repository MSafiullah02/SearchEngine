Though the challenge of measuring hand hygiene (HH) events and compliance was rightly highlighted, it is well recognised that the 'gold standard' methodology of direct observation (DO) does not produce accurate data [1] . The only alternative option given in the editorial was using data derived from the consumption of alcohol based handrub (ABHR), based on purchase orders, as a proxy measurement for HH events. As alluded to in the editorial, use of ABHR purchase order data per se can be problematic. A study by Lee et al. [2] demonstrated that fluctuations in HH events as shown in DO are not reflected in ABHR purchase order data. ABHR data only provides an organisational, or at best, a departmental picture of HH events [3] .",

            "text": "A closer look at AHHMS shows that there are three types of technology on offer; door monitoring systems, badge trackers worn by healthcare workers, and camera-based systems [6] . Door monitoring systems assume that a person entering a room equates to a HH event. However, this fails to recognise differences between staff groups -for example it may be necessary for a nurse to perform HH more times than a consultant in a given patient encounter. Additionally, these systems are not necessarily appropriate in hospitals with limited single room capacity. AHHMS which measure HH compliance rates based on individual staff entry into a single room, regardless of contact with the patient or their surroundings, could give misleading information. Use of badge trackers may also require staff to attach an additional badge and they may be asked to charge it at the end of their shift. This impracticability creates an additional step in staff workflow, which is unlikely to be adhered to. RFID technology incorporated into the badges also requires staff to stand at a specific location relative to ABHR dispensers, otherwise the HH event will not be logged. Camera-based systems produce data free of the Hawthorne effect, however this is at the expense of the time taken to observe large volumes of footage [6] . Clearly, despite the many limitations of current AHHMS, an optimal system putting the clinical user at the centre of the innovation should be possible. The key features for such innovative technology should include personal HH performance goals showing where and how to improve, no added workload for staff, robust high volume data that gives a true picture of reality and the capture of data from all staff groups regardless of role or location, plus ABHR /liquid soap consumption data.",
