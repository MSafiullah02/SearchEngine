Initially, 27 patients were reported which augmented to 41 on Jan 11, 2020, with 7 severe cases and one death [3]. Chinese authorities reported that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Influenza, Adenovirus and other common respiratory pathogens were ruled out as these cause of pneumonia (https://www.who.int/csr/don/12-january-2020-novel-coronavirus-china/en/). Later Chinese CDC identified novel coronavirus in one of the patient samples on 8th January 2020 (https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-says-person-infected-with-new-coronavirus-has-died-11578709453). Interestingly, the first genome (MN908947) was sequenced from an isolate of a positive patient sample and was released within next 2 days i.e. on 10th January 2020 (http://virological.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319). Based on phylogenetic analysis and taxonomy, coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses recognized the novel coronavirus as a sister to severe SARS-CoV and thus designated it as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [7].",

Four human coronaviruses (229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1) are most prevalent and commonly cause moderate to mild respiratory tract illness in humans [5].The two other strains i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic in origin and were reported as the major cause of respiratory infections outbreak from China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively [5].

The coronaviruses are comprised of four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) [6]. In SARS coronavirus, a defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) on S protein mediates attachment of the virus to its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [11]. The most abundant and conserved N protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 90% identical to SARS-CoV N protein [8]. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 genome showed 80% identity with SARS-CoV and 89% similarity with Bat SARS-like CoV at nucleotide level [8]. The RBD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein supports strong interaction with human ACE2 molecules despite its sequence variation from SARS-CoV S-protein [15]. Thus, it can be postulated that SARS-CoV-2 poses health risk for human transmission via S protein\u2013ACE2 interaction pathway [15].",

The patient with travel history to Wuhan, China and other affected countries in last few days (around 14 days) or close contact with a suspected/confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 will be tested for the virus. The next step, include screening of the suspected patients by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/peiris-protocol-16-1-20.pdf?sfvrsn=af1aac73_4).

Further, testing based on serological assays may be useful to confirm immunological response to the virus. In addition the genomic sequencing may provide essential information about the virus like mutations, origin and its similarity with other coronaviruses. WHO can assist Member States to recognize laboratories that are able to provide support and advise them on the correct management of sequencing data obtained during an outbreak (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/laboratory-testing-for-2019-novel-coronavirus-in-suspected-human-cases-20200117).",

Further reports of the confirmed cases and investigation of the original source of pneumonic cluster caused by SARS-CoV-2 suggests human-to-human transmission leading to epidemic expansion [10]. A probable transmission of the virus during incubation period from Germany is a disturbing factor that may lead to super spreading events [8, 14]. Infected health care workers also contributed significantly in the transmission particularly in Wuhan city during the initial phase of the outbreak. In addition, one cannot rule out the possible transmission by the asymptomatic individuals. Clearly, there is an invisible fine line of demarcation between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases both posing a challenge to researchers. The asymptomatic cases were between 12.5 and 25% in cases of SARS outbreak [1]. Taken together, all these factors may affect the overall transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 during this outbreak [14].",

CDC has outlined preventive measures which include washing hands with soap and water for more than 20 s. Individuals can also use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Suspected patients, health care workers and the individuals in contact with the patients should always wear face mask (N95/99) and use tissue while sneezing/coughing (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html). Suspected individuals/patients should avoid touching face, nose, eyes, tongue by hands. It is also recommended for the suspected individuals/patients that they should avoid partially cooked foods and frozen meat. These habits can be implemented on daily basis to prevent infection. Further, CDC does have specific guidance for travelers (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/warning/novel-coronavirus-china). WHO has recommended few guidelines for safe home care for patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.who.int/publications-detail/home-care-for-patients-with-suspected-novel-coronavirus-(ncov)infection-presenting-with-mild-symptoms-and-management-of-contacts).

No specific treatment is available against SARS-CoV-2 infection at present. Supportive care such as fluid intake, fever management, cough management, etc. is the main basis of treatment. In addition, patients with difficulty in breathing may be hospitalized and may require respiratory support in terms of oxygen supplementation. Patients of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and other chronic infections should be monitored carefully for any deterioration of vital organs. Blood pressure of the patients with hypertension should be monitored regularly and repeatedly. Urine output of the patients should also be observed to monitor the possibility of renal failure. Agranolocytosis (decrease in white blood cells due to suppression of bone marrow) is the possibility and hence these patients should be monitored for possible opportunistic infections. Future antiviral therapeutics involves research on neutralizing antibodies, passive antibodies transfer, blocking of the (ACE2) receptor to prevent binding of virion to the host cell and repurposing of available antiviral drugs [9].",

The daily increase in the infectious cases and death rates poses a greater challenge for the scientific community. On 30th January, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a \u201cPublic Health Emergency of International Concern\u201d (http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/international-healthregulations/news/news/2020/2/2019-ncov-outbreak-is-an-emergency-of-international-concern) and later a pandemic (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen). Till 18th March 2020 a total of 202,277 cases are confirmed globally with SARS-CoV-2 infection, which includes 8012 deaths and 82,813 recovered cases. Outside of China more than 1,21,000 cases including 4775 deaths, are confirmed in 166 countries and territories including the regions of Asia, Europe, Americas and Western Pacific Region (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). China alone accounts for 40% (80,894) of this global infection of which 4% (3237) are deaths (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). According to an epidemic prediction, some 190,000 people could be infected in Wuhan [13]. Although the number of cases outside China is alarming but the human to human transmission poses significant public health risks. The first death outside China occurred in the Philippines followed by another at Hong kong, however, the death rates are found higher in Italy (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) and it has become the hot-spot of maximum number of cases outside China. Also, the 3711 people on Diamond Princess ship including 1100 crew members,went into quarantine off Japan on February 5, after the identification of a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 from a former passenger (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/02/passengers-leaving-diamond-princess-ship-quarantine-ends200219031758493.html). As of now, (18th March), 712 cases have been identified among the original 3711 people on the ship which includes 7 deaths (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).",

With 8012 deaths so far out of 202,277 infections, the SARS-CoV-2 has a death rate of 4% which is significantly lower than SARS, which possess death rate of around 10% (https://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/Table2004_04_21/en/). The asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 may create a major problem in controlling the disease\u2019s spread and thus enhancing the virus endemicity (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00236-9). The identified death rate for the SARS-CoV-2 may possibly decrease as mild and asymptomatic cases are identified (https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-new-estimates-of-infection-rate-of-novel-coronavirus/). Many countries have evacuated their nationals from Wuhan and other cities of China and they were quarantined to monitor them for symptoms in an attempt to stop contagion (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51305526). The 167 countries and territories with the confirmed cases are represented in Fig. 2. The number of confirmed and death cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection are summarized in Table 1. The virus is likely to spread to other geographical regions probably due to immunological naive population.",

Apart of Kerala, the suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2 have also been reported from New Delhi and NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Patna, etc. From 4th of March, India has made the screening tests mandatory at 21 airports, including those in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Cochin (https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/features/coronavirus-affected-countries-india-measures-impact-pharma-economy/). National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) institutes are designated as laboratories meant for testing for SARS-CoV-2 in India. In addition, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India has formulated the relevant guidelines for surveillance and clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 cases (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/). Apart of thousands of infections in China, India\u2019s cases will inevitably raise further alarms over the worldwide spread of the virus as China and India currently accounts for about 37% of the global population.",

Moreover, generation of high level of awareness in the society and involvement of Government machinery will also go a long way in management of this epidemic. Elaborate investigations on transmission dynamics, clinical spectrum of disease and its correlation with genetic and immunological aspect also needs to be investigated. Phylogenetic and Bayesian analysis of the circulating strains will provide insight on the evolutionary trajectories of the virus including the origin and nucleotide substitution rates. In addition, the vaccine development efforts and identification of therapeutics including drug repurposing against SARS-CoV-2 should be perused on urgent basis. Further, formulation of broad spectrum antiviral agents against human coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2-CoV and MERS-CoV) is another aspect that can be explored in future studies. The emergence and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to a global peril has become highly distressful. Management of this ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is a challenge for the global community and it needs our due deliberation and immediate action.",
