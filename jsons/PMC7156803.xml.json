The authors highlight the high prevalence of cutaneous irritation associated with N95 mask and goggle use\u2014echoing previous reports highlighting cutaneous adverse events associated with PPE use for severe acute respiratory syndrome2\u2014and their data suggest that increased duration of PPE use may be associated with an increased risk of cutaneous irritation.",
