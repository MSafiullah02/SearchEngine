The number of submissions to CMI during the first 4 months of 2020 increased by 60% compared to the same months in 2019. At its peak, over 40 articles were submitted on a single day; most of them concerning COVID-19. The majority was rejected, many immediately by the editors without peer-review. The decisions were not easy. We would like to explain our decisions, according to the type of submission. We hope thereby to save authors, editors and peer-reviewers time and avoid unnecessary efforts.",

But when counted in millions, clinical or laboratory findings in one or two patients might be just a coincidence (e.g., a non-specific finding that may ultimately be due to another condition in a patient with COVID-19; or a false positive result for the virus in a patient with another disease); and we would like to see larger and well described denominators.",

Or the other way around, to those patients perceived to stand a better chance? Or (in some settings) to those who can pay? Or to opinionated patients with opinionated families? Or prescribed by some physicians, or units, and not by others? It is difficult to assume that the new treatments were given at random.
