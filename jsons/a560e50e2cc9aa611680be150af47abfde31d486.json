We start from the observation that insurance contracts are inherently linked to financial markets, be it via interest rates, or -as in hybrid products, equity-linked life insurance and variable annuitiesdirectly to stocks or indices. By defining portfolio strategies on an insurance portfolio and combining them with financial trading strategies we arrive at the notion of insurance-finance arbitrage (IFA). A fundamental theorem provides two sufficient conditions for presence or absence of IFA, respectively. For the first one it utilizes the conditional law of large numbers and risk-neutral valuation. As a key result we obtain a simple valuation rule, called QP-rule, which is market consistent and excludes IFA.",

If it is true that a share, a call option and an insurance contract all qualify as securities defined as the legal representation of the right to receive prospective future benefits under stated conditions, see Sharpe et al. (1999) , the environment of current trade varies with the security to be sold or bought. While the share is anonymous in terms of buyer and seller, a call carries the information of the party who wrote it, an insurance contract can be sold only by an office and to a person who explicitly appears in the contract, see for example Boudreault and Renaud (2019) . In contrast to financial markets, participants in primary insurance markets are a priori separated into two groups: potential sellers (insurance companies) who are to provide contracts contingent to insurance events and potential buyers (insurance seekers) who will provide premiums as current cash. Secondary markets for insurance are rare and therefore not considered here.",

The definition of (financial) arbitrage as the simultaneous purchase and sale of the same, or essentially similar, security in two different markets for advantageously different prices, see Sharpe et al. (1999) , relies on despite whatever finance related event happens-type statements and may require the insurance seeker to act as a seller of contracts, a rather rarely allowed case. Hence we have to find an appropriate definition of insurance arbitrage as a (first) step towards valuation.

As a next step, we show that bounding p suitably from above guarantees the absence of insurance arbitrage (NIFA) which we find a reasonable condition to the status of valuation. To the best of our knowledge this requirement is new in the literature.",

The recent corona outbreak highlights the necessity of allowing dependence between mortality and stock markets.

We fundamentally analyze the valuation of these products by introducing actuarial portfolio strategies combined with financial trading strategies and relate them to the absence of insurance-finance arbitrage (IFA). Moreover, we provide a simple valuation rule which avoids insurance and finance arbitrage. This is illustrated in an affine framework.",
