It has infected millions with more than 181,000 fatal cases as of 22 nd April 2020. Currently, there are no specific COVID-19 therapies. Most patients depend on mechanical ventilation. Current COVID-19 data clearly highlight that cytokine storm and activated immune cell migration to the lungs characterize the early immune response to COVID-19 that causes severe lung damage and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. In view of uncertainty associated with immunosuppressive treatments such as corticosteroids and their possible secondary effects, including risks of secondary infections, we suggest immunotherapies as an adjunct therapy in severe COVID-19 cases. Such immunotherapies based on inflammatory cytokine neutralization, immunomodulation and passive viral neutralization, not only reduce inflammation, inflammation-associated lung damage, or viral load, but could also prevent intensive care unit hospitalization and dependency on mechanical ventilation both of which are limited resources.",

            "text": "Recent clinical data suggest that severe COVID-19 is due to an overreactive immune response leading to a cytokine storm and development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. 12, 13 Plasma obtained from COVID-19 patients, in particular moribund patients, demonstrated increased concentrations of various inflammation-related cytokines and chemokines implicated in the recruitment of immune cells including interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-17, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), CCL3 and CCL4. 1, 14, 15 In addition, COVID-19 patients showed relatively increased neutrophil counts in the blood. 15 On the other hand, monocytes, basophils and T cells, especially CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, were decreased in the peripheral blood, possibly due to their migration to the lungs. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] However, these T cells exhibited enhanced activated markers (CD69, CD38 and CD44). 17 Single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid immune cells from a small number of mild to severely ill COVID-19 patients suggested that balance in the lung macrophage populations is highly dysregulated in severely ill COVID-19 patients. These data indicate that monocyte-derived macrophages (FCN1 + ) rather than FABP4 + alveolar macrophages contribute to lung inflammation and lung damage in severe cases. 18 This study thus confirms another report based on lung postmortem biopsy of a patient that revealed the presence of bilateral diffuse alveolar damage and recruitment of monocytes. 13 The study by Liao et al. also observed an increased proportion of clonally expanded CD8 + T cells in the BAL fluid of mild cases as compared to severe cases. 18 Another investigation that compared BAL fluid immune cells in various respiratory pathologies highlighted a more prominent surge of neutrophils in COVID-19 patients as compared to pneumonia caused by other pathogens. 19 By metatranscriptome sequencing of BAL fluid and global functional analyses of differentially expressed genes, this report also identified strong upregulation of numerous type I IFN-inducible genes. 19 However, caution needs to be exercised while interpreting these data due to potential influence of therapies such as IFN\u03b1-2b, ant-viral and/or steroids on the landscape of immune cells and immune signatures of BAL fluid or lungs. Nevertheless, these reports confirm the proposition that an influx of immune cells to the lungs follows SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 1 ).",

Similarly, as per a survey from the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen are also not recommended due to infectious complications and kidney, cardiac and gastrointestinal adverse effects. 31 In view of an uncertain prognosis and complications due to generalized immunosuppression from corticosteroid and NSAID treatment, immunotherapies based on immunomodulatory approaches appear promising in the treatment of COVID-19 to regulate inflammation and antiviral immune responses.

Obtained from the pooled plasma of several thousand healthy donors, IVIG is one of the most widely used immunotherapies for a large number of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. 43, 44 A recent open-label trial in three patients reported benefits of IVIG therapy (0.4 g/kg for five days) in severe SARS-CoV-2-induced pneumonia 45 thus providing another option for the management of COVID-19 patients. Another multicenter retrospective cohort study indicated that IVIG therapy could benefit critical COVID-19 patients, but dose (0.1-0.5 g/kg) and duration of therapy (5-10 days) were too variable. 46 However, grouping of patients based on the dose of IVIG (>15g/day or \u226415g/day) and timing of infusion (>7 or \u22647 days since hospitalization) implied that beneficial effects are associated with high dose and early IVIG treatment. 46 A retrospective study on 58 severe or critically ill cases of COVID-19 also found that adjunct therapy with IVIG within 48 hours of hospitalization reduced hospital stay and ventilator use, and improved 28-day mortality. 47 Other than IL-6 and CRP, inflammatory parameters following IVIG immunotherapy were not evaluated in detail in these patients. 46 Based on the vast literature on the mechanisms of IVIG, we suggest that IVIG suppresses the activation and secretion of inflammatory cytokines from the innate immune cells, blocks the inflammatory Th1 and Th17 responses, exerts scavenging effects on complement cascade and possibly enhances Tregs. 48, 49 In addition, IVIG contains antibodies to diverse pathogens and their antigens, 50, 51 and hence secondary infections could also be prevented in IVIG-treated patients.",

This monoclonal antibody-IL-2 complex displayed promising results in experimental models of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. 75 Recently, a human anti-IL-2 antibody named F5111.2 has been designed that potentiates Tregs by a structure-based mechanism wherein this antibody stabilizes IL-2 in a conformation that results in the preferential STAT5 phosphorylation of Tregs. 76 Though not yet tested in humans, such approaches could boost Treg number in COVID-19 patients and reduce inflammation. On the other hand, low dose-IL-2 therapy has been explored in the clinic for several autoimmune diseases to expand Tregs. 77 But due to the fact that COVID-19 patients are reported to have high IL-2 in the blood, this option might not be useful.",

Late initiation of therapy with anti-viral drugs, particularly after 10-14 days post appearance of clinical symptoms, might lead to a poor outcome. 7 Though the study design and results were controversial, data from a small number of patients suggested utility of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 treatment. 11 The follow-up study by the same group in a cohort of 1061 COVID-19 patients demonstrated that a hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination when given during the early phase of the disease, prevents aggravation of the disease and viral persistence. 80 Further details of this study are awaited. A randomized trial also observed improved pneumonia in hydroxychloroquine-treated patients. 81 Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine possess an unique ability to increase the pH of lysosomes and hence prevent SARS-CoV-2 viral fusion and replication. In vitro studies on chloroquine suggested anti-SARS-CoV-2 effects of these molecules. 82, 83 Interestingly, previous studies have demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity of chloroquine for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. But other clinical trials did not support the use of hydroxychloroquine, particularly in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with hypoxic pneumonia or severe COVID-19 cases. 84, 85 Therefore, it appears that any efficacy hydroxychloroquine might have requires that it be given during the early phase of COVID-19 before progression to more severe disease. However, due to side effects, particularly cardiac, it is recommended to use chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine under strict medical surveillance. More evidence from randomized clinical trials is required",

Anti-viral drugs would reduce the viral load and hence lessen the stimuli for inflammatory responses, while immunotherapies would correct the dysregulated inflammatory response and prevent lung damage. Care must be taken regarding an appropriate window of treatment and selecting the dose of anti-inflammatory immunotherapies as excessive suppression of inflammation might reduce the capacity of the patient to mount anti-viral responses.
