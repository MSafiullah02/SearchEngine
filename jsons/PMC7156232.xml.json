The virus was officially named 2019-nCoV by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention [1], and the disease was later termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) [2]. During the first month of the outbreak, there were 16,500 confirmed cases, 360 fatalities, and over 20,000 suspected cases in China [3]. By March 11, 2020, the rapid spread of the virus had caused more than 118,000 cases and 4,291 deaths in 114 countries from Asia to the Middle East, Europe and the United States. The WHO thus declared that the epidemic of COVID-19 had become a \u201cglobal pandemic\u201d.",

Current studies have revealed that 2019-nCoV may have originated from wild animals, but the exact origin remains unclear [4]. It is now believed that 2019-nCoV interpersonal transmission occurs mainly via respiratory droplets and close contact [5]. There may be additional risks of fecal-oral transmission, as researchers have identified 2019-nCoV in the stool of patients from the United States [6]. However, whether 2019-nCoV can be spread through aerosols or vertical transmission is yet to be confirmed [7]. The incubation period of COVID-19 has been estimated at 4-7 days on average, but there is evidence that it could be as long as 14 days [8], which is now the commonly adopted duration for medical observation or quarantining. Although patients with symptomatic COVID-19 have been the main source of transmission, recent observations have suggested that asymptomatic subjects as well as patients within the incubation period are also carriers of 2019-nCoV [9]. This epidemiologic feature of COVID-19 has made its control extremely challenging, as it is difficult to identify and quarantine these patients harboring occult disease, which can result in increasing risks of community transmission of 2019-nCoV.",

Previous studies have reported that a protracted radiotherapy time and an extended radiotherapy interruption could both contribute to inferior local control and overall survival in cancer patients [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Therefore, how to best protect these susceptible patients from COVID-19 during this pandemic without extended treatment interruptions or protracted overall radiotherapy time is a serious issue facing every radiation oncology department. Additionally, there is also a great risk of the infection spreading to staff members, owing to the direct interaction with infected patients before they are identified as positive (including suspected carriers, asymptomatic cases, patients with negative results on early nucleic acid tests, and patients with ultra-long incubation periods) [16], [17]. In addition, the closed environment (many radiotherapy centers are situated in basements) of the radiotherapy treatment rooms and the gathering of patients in the waiting area may further increase the risk of infection among patients and staff. Therefore, enhanced requirements are essential for COVID-19 protection and prevention at radiotherapy centers for both cancer patients and the medical staff.",

Because of these rapidly-developing circumstances, our radiotherapy center treated about 40 patients per day (roughly 1/7 of the regular patient load). Considering the higher risk of infection, for each group of 13 radiation therapists, only 9 were on active duty and the other 4 remained as backups in case any of the 9 became infected during the week. From February 13 to March 1, the outbreak in Wuhan plateaued and appeared increasingly under control with decreasing daily tallies of newly-confirmed cases. As a result, the patient load increased, resulting in placing 2 of the backup therapists back on active duty (i.e., 11 therapists on duty and 2 as backups in each group). On March 2, newly-confirmed cases in Wuhan dropped under 200 for the first time since the outbreak. On March 16, at the time of writing, the newly-confirmed case count dropped to 1. With lower risks for infection, the patient load then continued to increase to 90-100 patients per day, up to 1/3 of the regular patient load. Therefore, the full group of 13 therapists were put on active duty.

Unlike most Western countries, malignancies such as breast or prostate cancer comprise a very small fraction of our patient population treated during this pandemic.

            "text": "Despite the success of the management techniques highlighted herein, shortcomings and trade-offs must be tolerated during a pandemic. First, with our approach, treatment was commenced only after active COVID-19 was ruled out. Although this is an excellent approach to infection control, it may be oncologically detrimental owing to delaying the time from diagnosis to initial treatment. There are advantages and disadvantages to either approach, but the high acute mortality rate from COVID-19 led to the prioritization of infection control over potential incremental losses in local control. Second, no prioritization by cancer site/type was performed, as the time a patient had waited to start radiotherapy was honored, regardless of tumor type. The disadvantage of this approach primarily lies in a further increase in the time interval from diagnosis to initial therapy if radiation treatment is at capacity due to the reduced staffing level. This may impact outcomes of rapidly proliferative neoplasms such as those of the head and neck, lung, and cervix. The main reason that our center did not implement any site-based prioritization was because the patient load during the peak of the outbreak was naturally reduced to one-seventh to one-third of the normal patient load. Therefore, even with the reduced staffing level based on the rotating schedules, the patient load was not close to being at capacity. The drop in patient load was in part due to patient-elected risk-evasion decisions to pause or delay radiotherapy, and also partly due to traffic restrictions during the Wuhan lockdown. Third, and most importantly, the measures taken at our institution may not be directly extrapolated to other institutions, largely because the number of LINACs, employees, as well as PPE and other resources is highly variable between centers and circumstances in various countries. As a result, our experience is not presented for direct emulation purposes, but is rather meant to provide an experience-based summary of the policies and procedures that can be considered by other centers, and modified based on individual circumstances, in order to address the unique challenges of this unprecedented global health crisis.",

First, specialized protection and prevention taskforces were appointed at the hospital as well as departmental levels. Responsible for overall clinical operation management during the outbreak, these teams worked on area zoning for varying levels of protection and prevention, organized personnel COVID-19 training, and designed staff rotations. Second, a screening workflow was implemented before inpatient admission. Patients were informed of the requirements for entering radiotherapy areas. Modifications were made to the radiotherapy workflow to fit the special COVID-19 protection requirements. Third, the radiotherapy center zoning was executed according to different contamination levels. Personnel working in different zones were also instructed to follow their corresponding protection procedures and wear corresponding PPEs. Fourth, disinfection procedures in different zones and waste disposal were clearly delineated and implemented. Finally, preparation plans were put in place for possible emergent events. Thus far, the COVID-19 protection and prevention measures effectively ensured the safe and smooth clinical operation in our radiotherapy center and protected our patients and staff against COVID-19 infection. As such, in Wuhan, the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, during the 6+ weeks of radiation oncology clinical operation, no COVID-19 infection occurred at our radiotherapy center for our patients or employees.
