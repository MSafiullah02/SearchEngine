The first round occurred in the 1980s, when pharmaceutical companies convinced the US government that the lack of patent protection in developing countries was a major trade barrier that helped to explain the US trade deficit (Sell, 2003). The US then pressured developing countries to increase their patent protection by relying on the threat of trade sanctions and the promise of privileged trade access. A deal was finally concluded in 1994 with the creation of the WTO.",

Combined with the HIV/AIDS crisis, this lawsuit was a catalyst for the emergence of what became the access to medicines campaign. NGOs portrayed the South African case as a battle between greedy and powerful transnational corporations defending excessive profit margins and a weak state defending human life. Even when pharmaceutical companies dropped the case and the US relaxed its diplomatic pressure, developing countries were able to take advantage of the momentum created by NGOs. At the 2001 WTO conference, they successfully obtained the Declaration on TRIPs and Public Health which called for international negotiations to address the need of certain countries to import generic medicines. In 2003, a WTO decision defined the conditions under which a country could export generic pharmaceutical products to another and, in 2005, the decision was translated into a permanent amendment to the TRIPs agreement.",

The key here is to mimic the expected economic returns for the blockbuster as viewed at the time the investment decision is made, not at the time of sale. Rather than relying on an estimate of the price per dose that the market would provide, an AMC works by fixing an artificial price per dose based on a promise to pay by a country, a foundation, an intergovernmental fund or a combination of these. Those making the promise would establish criteria that the medication or vaccine would need to meet, a guaranteed per dose price and a pool consisting of a fixed amount of money that would be used to pay that price. Based on this promise, a producer would create and manufacture a medicine or vaccine meeting the criteria and sell it in one of the designated developing countries. That country would pay a small amount per dose (a \u2018co\u2010payment\u2019) while the AMC sponsors would top up that amount to the guaranteed per dose price until the pool funds are exhausted. After that point, the producer would agree, in advance, to sell the medicine at a fixed price (that is less than the guaranteed price) or allow generic competition.",

Participating companies agree to sell vaccines for no more than $3.50 a dose during a ten\u2010year period. These firms will receive an additional $3.50 per dose for up to 20 per cent of those doses.

Instead, it fits within the existing market logic, making it very palatable to industry. It is this very logic, however, that raises the most significant concern with AMCs. At a time when the pharmaceutical industry is questioning its own business model (Gold et al., 2008; Munos, 2009, 2010), the AMC can be viewed as an incentive to maintain the status quo. This is because the AMC relies on strong intellectual property rights, existing research strategies and current models of distribution rather than on innovative models or strategies.",

If the patent covers a medicine primarily used in countries with little market pull, then the patent holder would normally be better off selling the patent for some value rather than trying to gain a profit by selling the medicine itself at low margins.",

Kremer (1998) points to the possibility of collusion among innovators and suggests a complex mechanism of auctions and other strategies to arrive at an appropriate price. Perhaps of even greater concern is that, knowing that their patents may be bought out, firms may begin patenting knowledge that they otherwise would have left in the public domain or may secure a larger number of patents than necessary in order to inflate prices. As patents are well known to give rise to strategic behavior (Harhoff et al., 2008), this could very well limit the use of patent buy\u2010outs to situations in which a patent already exists (as opposed to offering buy\u2010outs prospectively) where there are clear controls against collusion, overpatenting and other market distortions.

Second, PDPs are subject to the politics of international health priorities.

With support from the World Health Organization and the National Institutes of Health, the parties began the long process of creating the SARS pool.

            "text": "Apart from these anti\u2010trust issues, one of the most pressing practical challenges in implementing a patent pool is to convince private sector actors to join. While the SARS patent pool was moving in this direction, the Medicines Patent Pool will likely be the first to attempt to convince pharmaceutical companies to participate in it. Indeed, to have a realistic chance of success, this, as well as other pools, will need to rely largely on voluntary licenses from patent holders. If a pool is unable to gather all the required licenses using a voluntary approach, pool administrators will need to consider whether to seek compulsory licenses over remaining patents. But a pool based solely or even predominantly on compulsory licenses would be unworkable, as it would have no leverage to coordinate license terms, supervise production or reduce the costs of negotiation (Gold et al., 2007).",

However, the Medicines Patent Pool has so far failed to obtain most of the needed industrial licenses although it has gained licenses from the US National Institutes of Health. Unlike the latter licenses, the agreement between the Medicines Patent Pool and Gilead Sciences, announced in July 2011, does not establish a pool but a brokerage arrangement. Under this agreement, Gilead imposes its own licensing terms, including the requirement that generic manufacturers wait for Gilead to obtain US Food and Drug Administration approval, the direct payment of license fees to Gilead and the non\u2010reciprocal obligation of generic manufacturers to share improvements with Gilead. While likely to increase access, the arrangement with Gilead, if followed by other pharmaceutical companies, does not lead to the efficiencies and benefits promised by a patent pool.",

As illustrated not only in international debates concerning access to medicines, but more generally in national discussions over biopharmaceutical policy, there is open distrust between industry and the NGO backers of the Medicines Patent Pool (Clark et al., 2000; Gold et al., 2008; Gold and Morin, 2009). There is fundamental disagreement between these actors on the importance and value of patents and the role of generic companies and public sector institutions involved in research and development. Overcoming this antagonism will be difficult but, without it, managing pools cooperatively will be impossible.",

They include their unproven nature (prize funds), their limited nature (AMCs), their potential perverse effect (patent buy\u2010outs), their sustainability (PDPs) and, finally, a lack of trust that threatens their viability (patent pools). Of these concerns, the last \u2013 lack of trust \u2013 promises to be the most formidable (Morin and Gold, 2010).",
