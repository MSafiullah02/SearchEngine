The virus spread to almost entire globe in just 3 months. The infection was declared pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11th, 2020. There are four different types of coronaviruses \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4 responsible for causing infection in humans and other vertebrate species. According to phylogenetic analysis, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to family Coronoviridae (genera Betacoronavirus) that has previously caused two epidemics known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) also known as SARS virus and middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The genome of SARS-SoV-2 was 85% homologous to bat SARS like virus and also possess 79% homology with SARS-CoV. In addition to this, pangolins have also been reported to be intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 (Lake, 2020).",
