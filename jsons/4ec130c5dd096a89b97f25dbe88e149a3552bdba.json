The disease, now referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 , is caused by a novel human CoV, which was initially denominated 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and later renamed as SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) the by Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) . COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, in humans exposed to wildlife at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which is the largest seafood market in central China, and where different species of farm and wild animals are commonly sold (Lorusso et al., 2020) . The epidemic has then expanded not only to neighbouring Asian countries, but also to other continents (https://www.who.int/ docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200415-sitrep-86-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=c615ea20_2). .",

Historically, only two human CoVs (HCoVs) had been known before the SARS emergence, namely HCoV-229E, an alphacoronavirus originated in bats and transmitted to humans through alpacas, and HCoV-OC43, a betacoronavirus which had passed from rodents to humans through cattle (Corman et al., 2015 (Corman et al., , 2018 . After 2002-2003 SARS epidemic, the renovated interest in HCoVs allowed the discovery of two additional viruses, the alphacoronavirus HCoV-NL63 and the betacoronavirus HCoV-HKU1, derived from bats and rodents, respectively (Tao et al., 2017) . All these four viruses are usually responsible for mild respiratory symptoms in immunocompetent patients. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are two unrelated betacoronaviruses originated in bats and transmitted to humans by wild carnivores and dromedary camels, respectively. In contrast to other HCoVs, these two viruses displayed an increased virulence, causing severe pneumonia and even the death of affected people, with mortality rates of about 10 % and 30 %, respectively (Guarner, 2020) .",

            "text": "The occurrence of three highly pathogenic CoVs with a zoonotic origin in less than two decades, highlights the role of animals in generating CoVs with increased virulence that can adapt to humans, causing epidemics (and eventually pandemics) with high impact on human health. Indeed, CoV infections of veterinary interest have been known since almost a century (Cavanagh, 2007; Pedersen, 2014; Decaro et al., 2020) , so that animal CoVs are paradigmatic of how this large family of viruses evolves, generating strains with different biological properties. In addition, the efforts done in veterinary medicine https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108693 Received 10 March 2020; Received in revised form 10 April 2020; Accepted 10 April 2020 evolve rapidly, changing their antigenic profile, tissue tropism or host range by means of two distinct mechanisms. The viral replicase (an RNA dependent-RNA polymerase) does not possess a good proof reading activity, therefore the incorporation of wrong nucleotides at each replication cycle and the consequent accumulation of mutations in the viral genome lead to a progressive differentiation of the viral progeny from the parental strain. This mechanism, which is well known for influenza viruses being responsible for the so called antigenic drift, may cause the progressive adaptation of the viral surface proteins to the cell receptors of new animal species, increasing the viral fitness. In addition, the particular replicating machinery of CoVs facilitates recombination events due to the presence of consensus sequences upstream each gene. Therefore, in the case of coinfection by more than one CoV strain, the RNA polymerase can jump from the RNA of a strain to that of the other one, synthetizing a hybrid RNA containing sequences from both viruses. Recombination can occur not only with genomic sequences of other CoVs (homologous recombination), but also with RNAs of different viruses and other organisms (heterologous recombination) (Luytjes et al., 1988; Banner and Lai, 1991; Lai, 1996; Zeng et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2016) . Recombination is an alternative mechanism that let CoVs acquire novel biological properties in terms of virulence, host range and tissue tropism, so that CoV strains, which are non-pathogenic or lowpathogenic in the original host, may increase their pathogenicity in the same species or adapt to different species spreading in the new host with exceptional rapidity (Banner and Lai, 1991) .",

            "text": "The occurrence of three human CoV epidemics in less than 20 years, along with the emergence of less pathogenic human CoVs, arises some questions on how these viruses that have their reservoirs in bats and rodents may overcome the species barriers jumping to humans. The animal-to-human transmission of viruses has been already occurred in the past, but it seems that its frequency has been increased in the last decades, involving in a short time span not only CoVs, but also a plethora of genetically and biologically different viruses with zoonotic potential, such as Ebola virus, influenza viruses, flaviviruses, Hendra and Nipah viruses (McMahon et al., 2018) . Climate changes that are intensifying in this first quarter of the 21st century are favouring the spread of vector-borne diseases through increasing the proliferation of vectors and predisposing to their occupation of new ecological niches. The emergence in temperate climate areas such as Europe of vectorborne diseases caused by viruses considered exotic until few years ago (West Nile virus, Usutu virus, Chikungunya virus) accounts for a progressive geographic expansion of tropical diseases thanks to the ongoing phenomenon of tropicalisation (McMahon et al., 2018) . Deforestation and urbanization are other major factors that facilitate the spill-over of zoonotic agents to humans by reducing the habitat of wildlife and increasing the chances of contacts between wild animals (like bats, rodents and birds) and human beings (Beena and Saikumar, 2019; Lorusso et al., 2020) . This could be the case of Ebola virus, Hendra and Nipah viruses, hantavirus and coronavirus infections. In addition, the close contact between human beings and different animal species sold at the wet markets of East Asia represents the optimal situation for the host species jump and adaptation to humans of potentially zoonotic agents like CoVs. It is not a coincidence that two of the most severe zoonoses of the last two decades (highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza and SARS) have emerged in the same Chinese province of Guangdong where the contact between humans and animals is closer (Lorusso et al., 2020) . Table 2 reports the most important avian CoV species recognised so far and their associated diseases. The number of avian species in which CoVs have been detected in the last years is humongous. Since the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2002, there has been increased interest in Table 2 Main coronaviruses in domestic and domesticated avian species. Schalk and Hawn (1931); Beach and Schalm (1936) ; Beaudette and Hudson (1937) Turkey ( Respiratory and kidney disease Spackman et al. (1983) N. Decaro and A. Lorusso Veterinary Microbiology 244 (2020) 108693 CoVs in other species, including birds. Prior to that time, our knowledge of CoVs in avian species was limited largely to three birds of the order Galliformes, i.e., domestic fowl (Gallus gallus), turkeys (genus Meleagris) and pheasants (Phasianidae), with their infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), turkey coronavirus (TCoV), and pheasant coronavirus (PhCoV), respectively. These three viruses were considered for a long-time different species for several reasons such as the diverse pathotype (enterotropic or respirotropic), host range and genetic relatedness of the S protein (Cavanagh, 2007) . This scenario radically changed after the discovery of several novel CoVs with high genetic diversity from different avian species and the novel rules for species designation of the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG https://talk.ictvonline.org/ictv-reports/ ictv_9th_report/positive-sense-rna-viruses-2011/w/posrna_viruses/ 222/coronaviridae). All these viruses as well as analogous IBV-like CoVs detected in other birds including penguins, pigeons, peafowl, parrots, waterfowl, teal, quail, duck and whooper swan (Cavanagh et al., 2002; Circella et al., 2007; Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2014; Torres et al., 2013; Hughes et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2005; Wille et al., 2016; Jordan et al., 2015; Bande et al., 2016; Suryaman et al., 2019) have been assigned to the same viral species known as Avian coronavirus (ACoV) within the subgenus Igacovirus of genus Gammacoronavirus. IBV and IBV-like strains are commonly detected in both gallinaceous and non-gallinaceous birds, also asymptomatically (Cavanagh, 2005) . This might suggest that these species would act as wild reservoirs, spreading IBV strains over the world (de Wit et al., 2011) . As for the huge economic impact of the disease it causes, IBV is one of the most studied CoVs over the last decades. IBV causes the infectious bronchitis (IB), a term adopted in 1931 for describing the main clinical characteristics of a transmissible respiratory disease of poultry detected for the first time in North Dakota (USA). IB has been now diagnosed worldwide and is one of the most important viral diseases of poultry characterised by respiratory signs, but it can also affect the kidneys and reproductive tract following viremia with a severity that differs depending on the involved viral strain (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . The disease also affects wild and ornamental birds Chen et al., 2013) .",

Being a CoV, IBV has, indeed, a considerable ability to change both by mutation and by homologous recombination events, which may cause, along with replicase stuttering or slippage, also insertions and deletions in the genome (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . If these mechanisms involve the hypervariable region S1, they frequently result in the emergence of new IBV variants. Although many new variants are not successful, a few may emerge, spread, causing devastating disease either worldwide or in limited geographic areas. Currently 32 lineages have been recognized, categorized into six genotypes (GI to GVI) (Valastro et al., 2016) . Through their S protein, IBV and IBV-like viruses recognise as cellular host receptor the \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid glycan, widely distributed in the respiratory tract and in several other host tissues, factor which may explain the tropism also for several organs of the infected host (Winter et al., 2006 (Winter et al., , 2008 Shahwan et al., 2013; Ambepitiya Wickramasinghe et al., 2011) . Extensive use of vaccines has greatly contributed to the high variability of IBV strains thorough recombination between vaccine and field viruses and viral selection pressure resulting from vaccination and presence of partially immune birds (Gandon and Day, 2008; Gandon et al., 2001; Bande et al., 2017) .",

While IBV is a primarily respiratory pathogen, TCoV causes gastrointestinal disease (Liais et al., 2014; Guy, 2008) . Enterotropism has also been observed for some IBV serotypes; however, all IBV strains infect primarily the respiratory tract, resulting in mild to severe inflammation of the nasal and tracheal epithelia (Cavanagh, 2005 (Cavanagh, , 2007 . The S1 domain of the S protein is highly variable, with the amino acid sequences of IBV and TCoV from the USA sharing < 25 % sequence identity. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene shows, indeed, grouping of IBV and IBV-like viruses on the one hand and TCoV-US, GfCoV and QCoV on the other hand (Ambepitiya Wickramasinghe et al., 2015a) . Accordingly, the emergence of CoVs in turkeys in the USA was proposed to have resulted from recombination events involving IBVs and an as-yet-unidentified CoV donating a novel S gene. This switch contributed largely to determine the in vivo tissue tropism of TCoV and related viruses. Intriguingly, the S protein of these CoVs requires nonsialylated type 2 poly-LacNAc structures on N-glycan cores for binding. This is in marked contrast to the \u03b12,3-linked sialic acid glycan binding of IBV and IBV-like viruses (Ambepitiya Wickramasinghe et al., 2015b) .",

This diversity was biologically evident by the prominent tropism for the epithelium of the bursa of Fabricius and only mild tropism for the small intestine of turkey. TCoV-FR S1 protein did not show, indeed, affinity for nonsialylated type 2 poly-LacNAc (Ambepitiya Wickramasinghe et al., 2015a) . This genetic diversity between TCoVs is in accordance with several recombination events involving IBVs on different continents with several unknown CoVs. On the one hand, the S genes of GfCoV/Fr/2011 (isolated in France in 2011) and TCoV-US share significant genetic relationships, and thus these viruses must have acquired their S gene from a common ancestor. On the other hand, GfCoV/Fr/2011 and Fr TCoV have a very similar genetic background in other genes. Two recombination events may be responsible for the genesis of TCoV-US and Fr TCoV. A first event occurred between an IBV EU recipient strain and an unknown ACoV donor, resulting in a virus with a new S gene, whose evolution would have resulted in Fr TCoV and GfCoV/Fr/2011. A second recombination event involving a US IBV recipient and GfCoV/Fr/2011 would have generated US TCoV viruses, which share a stronger S gene similarity with GfCoV/Fr/2011 than with Fr TCoV .",

However, this suggestion was rebutted by the evidence of a CoV belonging to the Gammacoronavirus genus in a beluga whale first discovered in 2008 (viral species Beluga whale coronavirus SW1 species, subgenus Cegacovirus, genus Gammacoronavirus) (Mihindukulasuriya et al., 2008) , and of three novel CoVs, BuCoV HKU1, ThCoV HKU12, and MuCoV HKU13 in birds of the order Passeriformes, namely bulbuls (Pycnonotus jocosus), thrushes (Turdidae) and munias (Lonchura punctulate), respectively, which did not cluster phylogenetically with extant CoVs identified in birds. These latter three viruses were distinct from known CoVs forming a unique cluster in the phylogenetic tree, which was the basis for generation of the Deltacoronavirus genus (Woo et al., 2009) . Importantly, additional novel viruses belonging to this novel genus were detected in wild birds Chu et al., 2011; Dur\u00e3es-Carvalho et al., 2015; Torres et al., 2016) . These viruses cluster with previously unclassified CoVs detected in various Asian carnivores, i.e., the Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) and Chines ferret badger (Nyctereutes procyonoides) (Dong N. Decaro and A. Lorusso Veterinary Microbiology 244 (2020) 108693 et al., 2007) . CoVs belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus, which are strictly related to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), were also described in wild birds, including parrots, in Brazil (Dur\u00e3es-Carvalho et al., 2015) . Interestingly, this was not the first detection of viruses belonging to the Betacoronavirus genus in birds. Often overlooked is the discovery over 38 years ago of a CoV from the Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), a bird that visits the shores of Britain in summer (Nuttall and Harrap, 1982; Cavanagh et al., 2007) . This virus was also related to MHV. However, at that time, considering the unusual finding and that the virus was isolated by passage of shearwater material in the brains of mice, it was speculated that the detected virus was an MHV strain already present in the mice before inoculation (Cavanagh, 2007) .",

Accordingly, regional patterns of bat CoV outbreaks at species level can be deduced from the population distribution of their respective bat hosts. Although bats seem to develop clinical diseases induced by several viruses and bacteria (M\u00fchldorfer et al., 2011) , generally CoVs do not cause apparently overt disease in these mammals, also experimentally.

Both strains have been detected in Myotis lucifugus bats (Vespertilionidae) also known as the northern American little brown bats. The former was detected in 2006 in Colorado (GenBank acc. no. KF430219), while the latter was reported in 2010 in Canada. This virus was identified in the intestines and lungs and associated with minimal pathology or inflammation (Subudhi et al., 2017) . Subgenus Decacovirus (genus Alphacoronavirus) comprises the species Rhinolophus ferrumequinum alphacoronavirus HuB-2013 composed so far by BtMs-Al-phaCoV/GS2013 and BtRf-AlphaCoV/HuB2013 strains discovered in China in Myotis spp. and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum bats, respectively. These two viruses share very high sequence identities (higher than 98 %), which dramatically decrease in the S genes (only 85% nucleotide identity) (Wu et al., 2016) . Woo et al., 2006) shares an 86 % sequence identity with severe acute diarrhoea syndrome-coronavirus (SADS-CoV) of pigs . These two viruses are now included in the same viral species Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2 (subgenus Rhinacovirus, genus Alphacoronavirus). Viral strains BtKYNL63-9a, BtKYNL63-9b, BtKYNL63-15 and BtKYNL63-9a, identified in 2010 in Triaenops afer bats from Kenya, form the viral species NL63-related bat coronavirus strain BtKYNL63-9b that is part of the subgenus Setracovirus (genus Alphacoronavirus) along with Human coronavirus NL63 (Tao et al., 2017) . In this regard, a bat origin has been strongly suggested for two of the less-pathogenic HCoVs causing mild respiratory symptoms in immunocompetent people, namely HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, both belonging to the Alphacoronavirus genus. Whereas HCoV-229E (subgenus Duvinacovirus) recognises as direct ancestor an alphacoronavirus from alpacas, which in turn derives from 229E-related CoVs identified in hipposiderid bats (Corman et al., 2015) , HCoV-NL63 is likely a recombinant virus originating from the distantly related 229E-related CoVs associated with hipposiderid bats and CoVs associated with Triaenops afer bats (Tao et al., 2017) (Table 1 ). The S protein of HCoV-NL63 is more closely related to that of 229E-related CoVs, whereas the rest of the genome with CoVs included in the NL63-related bat coronavirus strain BtKYNL63-9b species (Tao et al., 2017) . Different from the bovine coronavirus (BCoV)-like viruses that cause enteric disease, in 2007 a novel alpaca CoV was associated to respiratory disease in California, USA. Full-length genome analysis showed that this respiratory alpaca CoV was closely related to the alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E (subgenus Duvinacovirus) (Crossley et al., 2012) . More recently, close relatives of HCoV-229E were detected in African hipposiderid bats. Interestingly, both bat and alpaca viruses displayed an intact accessory gene ORF8 located at the genomic 3' end, while HCoV-229E retained only a conserved TRS preceding remnants of this ORF, suggesting its loss after acquisition of a 229E-related CoV by humans. Therefore, HCoV-229 is likely a descendant of the alpaca alphacoronavirus (Corman et al., 2015) .",

These two viruses are now the prototype strains of Tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and Pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5 viral species, respectively, within subgenus Merbecovirus, genus Betacoronavirus. Although MERS related CoVs (MERS-rCoVs) were lately discovered, MERS-CoV was much closer in the S1 region to HKU4-CoV than to MERS-rCoV or HKU5-CoV. Indeed, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), the receptor for MERS-CoV, is also the receptor for HKU4, but neither for HKU5 nor for early discovered MERS-rCoVs. However, HKU4 prefers bat DPP4 over human DPP4, whereas MERS-CoV shows the opposite trend . So far, HKU4-CoVs are only carried by Tylonycteris spp. bats (T. pachypus and T. robustula) and are relatively conserved; HKU5-CoVs are found in different Pipistrellus spp. bats, including P. abramus, P. pipistrellus and P. minus .",

            "text": "Due to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, attention should be given to the viral species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-rCoV,subgenus Sarbecovirus, genus Betacoronavirus) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-rCoV, subgenus Merbecovirus, genus Betacoronavirus), which enclose SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the first two highly pathogenic CoVs that were discovered in humans. In 2002, at the beginning of the SARS epidemic, almost all early human index patients had animal exposure in a market place, in Guangdong province, before developing disease. After SARS-CoV was identified, its RNA and/or specific antibodies were found in masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and animal handlers in a market place. However, later investigations of farmed and wild-caught civets revealed that SARS-CoV strains found in market civets were transmitted to them by other wild animals (Tu et al., 2004; Kan et al., 2005) . Subsequently, novel CoVs related to human SARS-CoV (SARS-rCoVs) were discovered in horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus) in China and Hong Kong Lau et al., 2005) . These SARS-rCoVs showed genome sequence identity of 88-90 % among themselves and 87-92 % identity to human or civet SARS-CoV isolates. SARS-rCoVs were detected in Rhinolophus spp. bats of other regions of China (Tang et al., 2006; Woo et al., 2006; Yuan et al., 2010; Ge et al., 2013) . SARS-rCoVs with higher genetic diversity with respect to Chinese strains were also detected in rhinolophid bats from Slovenia, Bulgaria and Italy in Europe (Drexler et al., 2010; Rihtaric et al., 2010; Balboni et al., 2011) . CoVs related to SARS-rCoV were also detected in Hipposideros spp. and Chaerophon spp. bats from Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria (Hu et al., 2015) . These evidences suggested that bats may be the natural hosts for SARS-CoV and that wild carnivores were only intermediate hosts. Although these SARS-rCoVs showed high sequence identity to SARS-CoV, they were demonstrated to be unable to bind to the human cell angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptor, the receptor of SARS-CoV, as a consequence of deletions in their S protein (Ren et al., 2008) . Besides, the theory of bat origin of SARS-CoV lacked a powerful support due to the failure of direct isolation of this virus from bats. Thus, considering that no direct progenitor of SARS-CoV was found in bats and that RNA recombination is the fuel for CoV evolution, it has been proposed that SARS-CoV emerged through recombination of bat SARS-rCoVs. This hypothesis was made after the evidence of a single bat cave in Yunnan, China, with very high CoVs diversity and considering that, within the identified CoVs, all genetic elements needed to form SARS-CoV have been identified in that single cave (Ge et al., 2013) . Recombination analysis also strongly supported the hypothesis that the civet SARS-CoV strain SZ3 originated following a recombination event of two existing bat strains, WIV16 and Rf4092 (Hu et al., 2017) . Moreover, WIV1, the closest relative to SARS-CoV that has been found in bats so far (more than 95 % nucleotide identity, higher than that of any other bat SARS-rCoVs (76-92 %)), likely arose through recombination of two other prevalent bat SARS-rCoV strains. The most frequent recombination breakpoints were within the S gene and upstream of ORF8, which encodes an accessory protein. These genes were also involved in the crucial adaptation pathways of SARS-CoV from bats to wild carnivores, from wild carnivores to humans, and from human to human (Cui et al., 2019) . WIV1 has been shown to have the capacity to bind to the human, civet and bat cell ACE2 receptor (Ge et al., 2013) . The isolation in cellculture of a highly related SARS-CoV strain, coupled with the evidence of a functional S protein capable of using the same ACE2 receptor, provided robust and conclusive evidence for the bat origin of SARS-CoV. An additional SARS-rCoV strain has been shown, by reverse genetics studies, to have the capacity to bind to the human ACE2 receptor (Menachery et al., 2015) .",

Indeed, the genome sequences of MERS-CoV in human and dromedaries possess only around 65-80 % nucleotide identities to those of the other members of subgenus Merbecovirus from different bats. Human MERS-CoVs were instead almost identical to MERS-CoVs identified in dromedary camels (Camelus dromedaries). Lately, genomic sequence analyses indicated that CoVs now belonging to the MERS-rCoV species were found in several bat species from two bat families, Vespertilionidae and Nycteridae (Lelli et al., 2013; De Benedictis et al., 2014; Corman et al., 2014a, b; Anthony et al., 2017; Moreno et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2019) . However, none of these MERS-rCoVs is a direct progenitor of MERS-CoV, as their S proteins differ substantially from that of the human virus. The closest relative to MERS-CoV of humans and dromedary camels is MERS-rCoV strain Neoromicia/5038 isolated from Neoromicia capensis bats in South Africa (Geldenhuys et al., 2018, Table 1 ). A short sequence (around 200 nucleotides) of viral RNA identical to that of MERS-CoV was also detected in a Taphozous perforates bat in Saudi Arabia (Memish et al., 2013) .",

It was suggested that MERS-CoV ancestors had been circulating in bats for very long time. MERS-CoV has evolved to adapt to use human receptor and the DPP4-recognising bat coronaviruses like HKU4 may follow up, thereby posing a serious risk to human health. Recent MERS-rCoVs were shown to have the capacity to bind to the DPP4 as entry cell receptor as they acquired the S1 through recombination with HKU4-like viruses (Luo et al., 2018a, b) .",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 has been assigned to an existing species of hundreds of known viruses largely isolated from bats. These viruses have names derived from SARS-CoV, but only the viral isolates originating from the 2002-2003 outbreak have been confirmed to cause SARS in humans (Gorbalenya et al., 2020) . Importantly, it has also been confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor through the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . Likely, also SARS-CoV-2 has a bat origin. According to genome sequences available so far, the most closely related virus (96.2 % of nucleotide sequence identity) to SARS-CoV-2 is strain BatCoVRaTG13 identified from a bat, Rhinolophus affinis, from Yunnan province, China, followed by SARS-rCoVs identified from pangolins (Tang et al., 2020) . The receptor-binding spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly divergent from other CoVs with less than 75 % nucleotide sequence identity to all previously described SARS-rCoVs, except for a 93.1 % nucleotide identity to BatCoVRaTG13 (Zhou et al., 2020) . Although SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor, five out six critical amino acid residues in RBD were different between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV; the same residues were instead identical to those of pangolin SARS-rCoVs and, in turn, only one of these residues was identical to those of BatCoVRaTG13 (Tang et al., 2020) , although this latter shows the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 along the whole genome. Thus, it was tempting to speculate that SARS-CoV-2 RBD region might have originated from recent recombination event in pangolins or that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-rCoVs of pangolins represent the result of coincidental evolution (Lam et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020) . Overall, it remains to be solved whether also SARS-CoV-2 needed an intermediate (and amplification) host before being able to infect humans as it was the case for SARS-CoV and other HCoVs. Since a mammal reservoir has not yet been identified, a prudent use of specific antigens is strongly recommended for serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in animals as cross-reactions with viruses of the Alphacoronavirus genus, widespread in animals, might occur (Sun and Meng, 2004) .",

This supports the hypothesis that rodent CoVs were the ancestors of embecoviruses of other animals, while bats are the natural reservoirs for all other betacoronaviruses. Importantly, rodent CoVs are not restricted to genus Betacoronavirus. A deep virological screening was performed in 1465 rodents sampled in Zhejiang province, China, during 2011-2013, with nearly 2% of rodents testing positive for CoV . In particular, CoVs were detected in 10 striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius), 4 Norway rats, 14 lesser ricefield rats (Rattus losea), 1 Asian house rat (Rattus tanezumi) and 1 Chinese white-bellied rat (Niviventer confucianus). Amplicons of the replicase gene sequences were recovered from 21 (70 %) of the CoV RNA positive rodent samples described above and whole genome or nearly whole genome sequences (> 98 %) were recovered from 1 and 4 CoV positive samples, respectively. By means of whole genome sequence analysis, authors were able to identify a divergent alphacoronavirus, which was lately officially designated as species Lucheng Rn rat coronavirus (LRNV) within the subgenus Luchacovirus, and two novel betacoronaviruses termed Longquan Aa mouse coronavirus (LAMV) and Longquan Rl rat coronavirus (LRLV) and assigned to the two established species Betacoronavirus-1 and Murine coronavirus, respectively . Moreover, LRNV seems to be a recombinant virus as its N protein gene is more closely related to those of the genus Betacoronavirus. Overall, the discovery of rodent-associated CoVs belonging to subgenera that are distinct from those including bat CoVs warrants further investigations upon the role played by rodents in the evolution and emergence of these viruses.",

Indeed, aged mouse model of SARS-CoV has been generated (Gretebeck and Subbarao, 2015) . Transgenic mice expressing human ACE2 were also developed to closely mimic SARS-CoV infection in humans. Some animal models have been tested and analysed on the genomic and proteomic level to study the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV. Therefore, we have reason to believe that such models would work also for SARS-CoV-2. Quite the opposite, studies have demonstrated that mice, guinea pigs and hamsters are not susceptible to experimental MERS-CoV infection, mainly because their homologous DPP4 molecules Table 4 Coronaviruses in domestic swine and associated diseases. do not function as receptors for MERS-CoV entry (Cockrell et al., 2014) . The first mouse model of MERS infection reported in 2014 involved transducing animals with recombinant adenovirus 5 encoding human DPP4 (hDPP4) molecules intranasally, and this resulted in replication of MERS-CoV in the lungs. This mouse model also showed clinical symptoms of interstitial pneumonia, including inflammatory cell infiltration, and thickened alveolar and mild oedema (Song et al., 2019) .",

TGEV and PRCoV are closely related to canine coronavirus (CCoV) and feline coronavirus (FCoV) forming with these carnivore CoVs a unique species, referred to as Alphacoronavirus-1. Based on the analysis of the accessory protein gene ORF3, it has been postulated that TGEV has originated from CCoV type II (CCoV-II), since while CCoV type I (CCoV-I) exhibits an intact gene, both CCoV-II and TGEV, which are strictly related in the S gene, have only remnants of ORF3 (Lorusso et al., 2008) . PRCoV, in turn, has derived from TGEV through the deletion of \u2248600 nucleotides at the 5' end of the S gene (corresponding to \u2248200 amino acids at the N-terminus of the spike protein) and consequent change of the major tissue tropism from the enteric to the respiratory epithelium. This large deletion caused the loss of sialic acid binding activity that allows the attachment to mucins and mucin-type glycoproteins, so that TGEV but not PRCoV is able overcome the intestinal mucus barrier, having access to the gut mucosa . PRCoV shares some epitopes for neutralising antibodies with TGEV, so that its extensive circulation in swine herds has resulted in a drastic reduction of TGE outbreaks worldwide.",

            "text": "PEDV was introduced in the pig population in the 1970s, likely as a consequence of a spillover event from bats. The virus was first described in Europe and had been primarily maintained as an endemic pathogen in European and Asian swine populations until its introduction into North America in 2013. PEDV is more strictly related to a Scotophilus bat coronavirus 512 than to other known alphacoronaviruses, including TGEV and human alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63. Therefore, PEDV and BtCoV/512/2005 likely have a common evolutionary precursor and a CoV cross-species transmission may have occurred between bats and pigs (Banerjee et al., 2019) . Accordingly, PEDV contains signature motifs at the 5\u2032-untranslated region that are shared by bat CoVs, thus providing further support of the evolutionary origin of PEDV from bats and potential cross-species transmission (Huang et al., 2013) . Currently, different PEDV genotypes are described based on the S gene: i) G1a PEDV, including classical European and Asian strains with moderate virulence; ii) G2 PEDV, also called \"original US PEDV\", comprising highly virulent strains that originated in Asia and are now widespread in the USA; iii) G1b PEDV, which is represented by the so-called S-INDEL strains, i.e., strains presenting insertions and deletions in the S gene that are associated with mild clinical outbreaks. These strains are natural recombinant PEDVs with a G2-like genomic backbone carrying an S1 region of G1a strains; iv) S1 N-terminal domain-deletion (NTD-del) strains that are G2-like strains containing a 194 to 216-aa deletion within the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit, also associated to mild clinical forms (Hou and Wang, 2019) . Recombinant strains between PEDV and TGEV have been also reported in Europe (Akimkin et al., 2016; Belsham et al., 2016; Boniotti et al., 2016) .",

These BCoV-like CoVs include viruses of domestic and domesticated ruminants that were reported in sheep and goats (Reinhardt et al., 1995; Yang et al., 2008) , water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) (Decaro et al., 2008c) , llamas (Lama lama) and alpacas (Vicugna pacos) (Cebra et al., 2003; Jin et al., 2007) . In the wild, BCoV-like CoVs were demonstrated in six species of the Cervidae family, which are caribou/ reindeer (Rangifer tarandus caribou), elk/wapiti (Cervus elephus), samber deer (Cervus unicolor), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), sika deer (Cervus nippon yesoensis) and water deer (Hydropotes inermis) (Amer, 2018) . Similar viruses were also found to circulate in the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) (Hasoksuz et al., 2007) , several species of antelopes (Alekseev et al., 2008; Chung et al., 2011) , wisent (Bison bonasus), Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus) (Chung et al., 2011) , and dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) (Woo et al., 2014) . The last strain, detected in the United Arab Emirates and consequently named dromedary camel coronavirus UAE-HKU-23 (DcCoV UAE-HKU23), was slightly divergent from other BCoV-like viruses (Woo et al., 2014) .",

Although human-to-human transmission has occurred outside Middle East due to travel-associated patients with MERS and has caused large clusters of human cases within healthcare facilities in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and United Arab Emirates, it remains inefficient and sustained community transmission has not being documented so far, thus suggesting multiple virus introduction into the human population by infected dromedaries (Hemida et al., 2017b) . More recently, a phylogenetic study of 173 MERS-CoV full-genome sequences revealed recombination signatures that defined five major phylogenetically stable lineages, all of which contained human and camel MERS-CoV sequences (Sabir et al., 2016) . In the same study, an alphacoronavirus strictly related to HCoV-229E was found in the respiratory tract of dromedary camels of Saudi Arabia (Sabir et al., 2016) . Although some studies ruled out the susceptibility of other domestic ruminants to MERS-CoV (Reusken et al., 2013; Adney et al., 2016) , a recent study detected specific antibodies and RNA in sera and nasal secretions, respectively, of domestic ruminants raised in Africa, including sheep, goats and cattle (Kandeil et al., 2019) .

Although they are neglected viruses and vaccination is not recommended due to the absence of an effective challenge model, two independent studies have demonstrated their significant involvement in the onset of acute canine enteritis (Duijvestijn et al., 2016; Dowgier et al., 2017) . The evolutionary history of CCoVs is tightly intermingled with that of TGEV and FCoVs. CCoV-I possesses a divergent spike protein and the intact form of an additional gene, ORF3, whose remnants are present in CCoV-II and, at a lesser extent, in TGEV. Therefore, CCoV-II has likely emerged as a consequence of recombination between the original CCoV-I and an unknown CoV in the S gene and of progressive loss of ORF3 (Lorusso et al., 2008) . A further recombination occurred in the very 5' end of the S gene between CCoV-II and TGEV, giving rise to back recombinant CCoV-II strains, also known as TGEVlike CCoVs, having a spike protein N-terminus of TGEV in a CCoV-II backbone (Decaro et al., , 2010 . Consequently, the CCoV taxonomy was revised, with classical and TGEV-like strains being referred to as CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb, respectively. While CCoVs are usually involved in mild forms of diarrhoea, there are some hypervirulent strains that are associated to severe, haemorrhagic, sometimes fatal gastroenteritis. In addition, CCoV-IIa strains, designated pantropic CCoV, that are able to spread systemically and cause severe disease and the death of infected dogs have been reported in Italy (Buonavoglia et al., 2006; Alfano et al., 2020) , other European countries (Decaro et al., 2013) and South America (Pinto et al., 2014) . Genomic sequences from pantropic CCoVs were analysed, but no obvious genetic signatures that may have caused the switch in pathogenicity were found (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2011; Decaro et al., 2013) .",

Jakob, 1914Jacob (1914 , Pedersen et al. (1984) Cat ( Erles et al. (2003) N. Decaro and A. Lorusso Veterinary Microbiology 244 (2020) 108693 a consequence of recombination events between CCoV-II and FCoV-I that generated viruses with a CCoV-II genomic region, encompassing ORF1b, ORF2 (S gene), ORF3abc, ORF4 (E gene), and partial ORF5 (M gene), in the context of an FCoV-I backbone (Pedersen, 2014) . Both genotypes are involved in the development of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a perivascular pyogranulomatosis of cats that may occur in two clinical forms, effusive and non-effusive FIP, which are characterised by prevalence of effusions in the body cavities and of pyogranulomatous lesion in organs, respectively. FIP occurs as a consequence of a change in tissue tropism of an enteric FCoV strain (feline enteric coronavirus, FECV), infecting enterocytes of the intestinal villi, that acquires the ability to infect monocytes/macrophages switching to the more virulent FIPV, which is responsible for systemic infections and dysregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines (Addie et al., 2009) . The changes responsible for the pathogenetic shift have been investigated for many decades, being suggested to be variably represented by point mutations located in the S gene (Rottier et al., 2005) , deletion/insertion in the group-specific genes 3c (Vennema et al., 1998; Chang et al., 2010) , 7b (Vennema et al., 1998) or 7a (Kennedy et al., 2001a) . However, none of these differences appeared to consistently correlate with disease phenotype. More recent studies have identified specific genetic signatures in the S gene of FCoV-I that are implicated in monocyte/macrophage tropism. Two amino acid substitutions, M1058 L and/or S1060A, corresponding to nucleotide mutations A23531 T/C and T23537 G, respectively, in the viral genome, together distinguished FCoVs found in the tissues of FIP cats from those found in the faeces of healthy cats without FIP in > 95 % of cases (Chang et al., 2012) . However, subsequent studies concluded that these mutations are likely to be markers of systemic FCoV infection rather than FIP per se (Porter et al., 2014; Barker et al., 2017) . Two alphacoronaviruses, both belonging to subgenus Minacovirus, are currently known in mustelids, namely Mink coronavirus 1 (MCoV-1) and Ferret coronavirus (FRCoV). MCoV-1 has been recently identified as the etiological agent of mink epizootic catarrhal gastroenteritis (ECG), an infectious disease of farmed American (Neovison vison) and European (Mustela lutreola) mink first described in 1975 (Larsen and Gorham, 1975) and later affecting several million mink in different countries (Vlasova et al., 2011) . The disease is observed at greater frequency in mink of \u22654 months and is characterised by seasonality, high morbidity (approaching 100 %) and low mortality (< 5 %). Recent full-genome analysis demonstrated that MCoV-1 is phylogenetically distant from CCoVs and FCoVs, being closely related to FRCoV (Vlasova et al., 2011) . Presently, the two viruses are considered separate species within subgenus Minacovirus (https://talk.ictvonline.org/taxonomy/).",

Analogous to FCoV, FRCoV exists in two different pathotypes: i) ferret enteric coronavirus (FRECV) is associated to ECE, a highly contagious diarrhoeal disease also known as green slime disease, which affects mainly young ferrets with morbidity and mortality rates similar to those of ECG; ii) ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV) is responsible for a systemic diseases of ferrets, which is characterised by pyogranulomatous perivasculitis and peritonitis resembling to those of FIP (Murray et al., 2010) . Similar to FIP, Wise et al. (2010) have shown that FRECV and FRSCV differ significantly in spike protein and that deletions in FRCoV 3c may also correlate with the severe pathotype of FRSCV. Recombination in the S, 3c and E genes between different FRCoV has been also reported (Lamers et al., 2016) . Different CoVs were found to circulate in wild carnivores. CCoVs were detected in wolves (Canis lupus), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra), common genets (Genetta genetta) (Alfano et al., 2019; Rosa et al., 2020) . CCoV-like viruses were also found in African wild carnivores, including spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) and silver-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) (Goller et al., 2013) .

Full-genomic comparative analysis has shown that SARS-like CoVs isolated from palm civets are under strong selective pressure and are genetically most closely related to SARS-CoV strains infecting humans early in the outbreaks (Song et al., 2005) . Sequence analysis of the SARS-CoV-like virus in masked palm civets indicated that they were highly homologous to human SARS-CoV with nucleotide identity over 99.6 %, indicating the virus has not been circulating in the population of masked palm civets for a very long time (Shi and Hu, 2008) . A Chinese ferret-badger (Melogale moschata) was found to have neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV (Guan et al., 2003) , whereas SARS-CoV RNA was detected in naturally infected cats and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), but not in domestic dogs . There was, however, a single dog testing positive for SARS-CoV (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/ 70863/WHO_CDS_CSR_GAR_2003.11_eng.pdf).

These hedgehog CoVs are are now included in a unique species, Hedgehog coronavirus 1 (subgenus Merbecovirus). The virus was not associated to any form of disease, so that Western European hedgehog is a reservoir host of EriCoV in the absence of apparent disease, suggesting that hedgehogs in addition to bats may contribute to the evolution of Merbecovirus (Saldanha et al., 2019) . A slightly divergent Merbecovirus was later found in Amur hedgehogs (Erinaceus amurensis) in China and was poposed as a prototype of a separate species, namely Erinaceus amurensis hedgehog coronavirus HKU31 (Ea-HedCoV HKU31) . A novel coronavirus, named W\u00e9nch\u00e9ng shrew coronavirus (WESV) was detected in shrews (Suncus murinus) in China . WESV is highly divergent from other alphacoronaviruses, exhibiting less than 71.1 % amino acid similarity to any known members of the genus Alphacoronavirus in the coronavirus-wide conserved domains of the replicase polyprotein pp1ab and less than 61.3 % amino acid similarity to the other three coronavirus genera. However, taking into account the current ICTV criteria, WESV is sufficiently divergent to be considered a distinct member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, but not a new genus of the subfamily Orthocornavirinae .",

            "text": "CoVs have been known in veterinary medicine since many decades; some of these viruses, such as IBV, swine enteric CoVs, BCoV and mustelid CoVs, can cause diseases that have a great impact on the farm industry. Other CoVs, namely FIPV, FRSCV and MHV, cause severe disease in companion (cats, ferrets) or laboratory (mice) animals. Animal CoVs are paradigmatic on how CoVs evolve through accumulation of point mutations and homologous (and heterologous) recombination, generating different genotypes and pathotypes. These virus variants may have different antigenic properties, escaping the host immunity induced by vaccines, as is the case of IBV. Alternatively, they may have a different tissue tropism in the same host that can increase or decrease the virus pathogenicity, as observed for the virus pairs FECV/FIPV or FRECV/FRSCV and TGEV/PRCoV, respectively. In other circumstances, the CoV evolution may result in the switch of the host range from one animal species to another one or from animals to humans. The former event is well documented in veterinary medicine, with a plethora of viruses being originated from IBV and BCoV that adapted to different animal species. However, the most interesting scenario is the jumping and further adaptation of an animal CoV to humans. There is increasing evidence that all HCoVs currently known recognise an animal origin, with bat or rodent CoVs being the most probable ancestors. In most instances, it was suggested that other mammals served as intermediate hosts prior to final adaptation to humans, i.e., alpacas and cattle for the low-pathogenic HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, respectively, and wild carnivores and dromedary camels for the high-pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. Other two HCoVs, namely HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, were likely derived from bats and rodents, respectively, but whether this transmission required an intermediate mammalian host is presently unknown. The origin of SARS-CoV-2 should be zoonotic, since highly related sequences were detected in bats, but a definitive intermediate host has been not identified so far. What should we expect from the current pandemic? When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infection was recorded. Even though, several years later, influenza was suspected to be the cause of it, in that pandemic involvement of central nervous system was more pronounced than in other influenza outbreaks. This evidence is further supported by molecular studies claiming that the most recent common ancestor of BCoV and HCoV-OC43 emerged around 1890 (Vijgen et al., 2005) and by the fact that HCoV-OC43 can be neuroinvasive (Arbour et al., 2000) . Likely, HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect dogs becoming established in this species as CRCoV . A similar scenario could be observed with SARS-CoV-2 with dogs and, at a greater extent, cats. Apparently, cats represent, within the domestic animals which have been experimentally infected, the host, together with ferrets, which is able to sustain more efficiently SARS-CoV-2 replication . Furthermore, based on structural studies and biochemical experiments, SARS-CoV-2 seems to have an RBD that binds with high affinity to ACE2 also from ferrets and cats (Andersen et al., 2020) . Reasonably, a full comprehension of the animal CoV molecular evolution, host range and pathobiology is beneficial to better understand the mechanism driving the emergence and adaptation to humans of zoonotic CoVs.",

This forecasting statement was not surprising to coronavirologists and it was not, importantly, surprising to those scientists that daily deal with the plethora of viruses existing at the human/animal health interface. Although scientists were well aware of this hazard, no substantial actions were taken forward the limitations of strict and repeated contacts between humans and wildlife. Indeed, whereas biological mechanisms underlying viral evolution are not under human control, social and cultural habits can be modified accordingly through a deep and pounding informative campaigns. If to the human habits we sum the impact of modern agricultural practices and urbanization and the decrease of vital space for wildlife, it is quite easy to understand that, if countermeasures are not taken, we will face novel serious health emergencies of animal origin in the following years with tremendous social and economic impact on our lives. As clearly demonstrated by the SARS-CoV-2 emergence, CoVs are the main characters of this intricate puzzle characterised by the interactions of viral biological mechanisms and human habits.",

Could have the current COVID-19 outbreak been avoided? Answering this question is not relevant now, but actions to avoid the next viral spillover from animals to humans is certainly a priority. This task needs to be coupled with massive genomic surveillance in wild animals not limited to CoVs. Massive sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 strains detected in humans and CoVs of wildlife will help further assess the origin of this novel human pandemic and plan future measures able to reduce the risk of emergence of new CoV spillover events. However, additional tasks should be provisionally addressed in order to reduce the risk of future CoV pandemic like the current one. These include: i) prevention of animal-to-human infections through a ban of the wet markets and a more friendly management of the environment; ii) studies on CoV-host interactions to be performed both in vitro (cell cultures, ex-vivo explants of the respiratory tract) and in vivo (animals susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection); iii) development of new anticoronaviral drugs and evaluation of their efficacy in cell cultures and animal models.",
