Patients are generally less than 3 years old. Predisposition to infections is generally mild to moderate, rarely severe. Signs commonly include infections involving skin, upper respiratory tract, and middle ear; and fevers of unknown origin. Spontaneous remission occurs within 13-20 months, although older patients are less likely to resolve spontaneously. Median neutrophil counts for patients seen at the Institute for Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Giessen, Germany, equal 250/L, with a monocytosis seen in 38% of patients, especially if infection is present at the time of the CBC. 3 Bone marrows are either normocellular or hypercellular with a decrease in mature neutrophils and bands.",

An association with immunization has not been reported. Ages of the patients in this paper suggest secondary AIN, but the underlying causes or precipitating agents remain unknown. In dog 1, antibiotic eyedrops had been administered a few days before presentation for vomiting and discovery of the neutropenia, but whether or not the neutropenia was already present at the time of the conjunctivitis is not known. Ocular signs may have been the 1st clue that the patient was neutropenic, but the signs were not severe enough to warrant a CBC. This patient had been receiving ivermectin as a heartworm preventative. An idiosyncratic drug reaction, resulting in neutropenia, is possible, but no reports in the literature connect ivermectin with blood dyscrasias. Finally, only baseline values for tickborne infectious agents were determined for dog 1, so the potential for AIN secondary to infection involving 1 of these agents cannot be discounted.",
