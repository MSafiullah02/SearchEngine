These are nucleic acid (DNA, RNA, and PNA-based types) and protein biochips. DNA biochips may be classified according to the two types of nucleic acid probes affixed to the chip's surface and by the density of such probes presented to a sample. Probes may be cDNA, generally derived from bacterial clone libraries, or oligonucleotides, prepared by solid-phase synthesis. Oligonucleotides may be in situ synthesized or presynthesized and then affixed to the chip substrate. One format for the DNA biochip uses a piece of glass, typically the size of a microscope slide, containing thousands of cDNA probes affixed to the glass platform within tiny (ca. 250 \u03bcm2) polyacrylamide gel pads (MAGIChip\u2122, MicroArrays of Gel-Immobilized Compounds on a Chip (3)). When fully integrated with sample preparation, microfluidic sample management, and analyte detection, these systems are commonly termed \u2018lab-on-a-chip\u2019, which may allow for field-portable DNA analyses. DNA biochips are widely used for the detection of mutations in specific genes and to detect the differences in gene expression levels in cells (2).",

Amongst these methods are those described as direct and others that are indirect. Direct methods derive their signals from the hybridization reaction directly, for example, quartz crystal oscillators, impedi-metric biochips, micro- and nanocantilevers, or interferometers. These detection methods exemplify responses that require no label and are therefore also referred to as label-free methods. Although label-free, their signals may be enhanced, limits of detection lowered, sensitivity increased, and dynamic ranges attenuated by the use of nanoparticle or chemically responsive labels. Indirect methods derive their signals from the measurement of a label, for example, a radioactive isotope or a fluorescence label.

In the 1970s, improvements in semiconductor technology led to the development of the field-effect transistor (FET) that usurped the ISE platform. The FET is a very high impedance transistor and most sensitive measurements of small potentials requiring very low currents are made using this technology. However, the FET proved expensive to produce and as such has yet to achieve its full commercial potential; in no small part because of difficulties with regard to its reliability in operation. Development and commercialization of pH-FETs and the emergence of organic thin film field effect transistors (TFTs) suggests that DNA FETs may become a technological and commercial possibility.",

One of the most widely used methods is voltammetry, which makes use of a microelectrode such as a platinum wire. The potential of the electrode is varied, generally in a linear sweep, and the resulting current is recorded as a function of the applied potential. The microelectrode restricts the current to a few nanoam-peres with the result that the concentration of the test substance in solution remains essentially unchanged after the experiment (7). Amperometry is the application of voltammetric measurements at a fixed potential to detect changes in the current as a function of the chemical potential of an electroactive species. Amperometric electrodes are made on a microscale (\u226550 \u03bcm diameter) which allows for enhanced mass transport independent of flow, an increased signal-to-noise ratio, and measurements in high-resistance media (8). As described later, electrochemical methods allow for miniaturization of instruments for use in DNA hybridization (9).",

When light is reflected at an optical interface where there is a change in the refractive index, there is a decay of energy away from the point of reflection into the surrounding medium (10). When the evanescent wave is used to excite fluorescent molecules bound to the surface of the waveguide, the phenomenon is termed total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF). If, however, there is an excitation of the electron plasma of a thin metal layer covering the surface of the waveguide, the process is called surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Both these phenomena, because of their considerable surface sensitivity, have received considerable attention in the development of DNA biochips.",

In fiber optics, the detection circuitry is completely electrically isolated from the point of measurement, which has important safety implications for clinical diagnostic devices. In fiber optic devices, it is possible to use small polymer microspheres coated with an absorbing or fluorescent dye. These spheres can be placed within a hollow tube fixed onto the end of the fiber bundle or attached directly to the surface of the fiber optic (11,12).

Quartz is the most frequently used piezoelectric crystal because it can act as a mass-to-frequency transducer. AT-cut crystals (+35\u00b0 15\u2032 orientation of the plate with respect to the crystal plane) are favored because of the excellent temperature coefficients in the range 10\u201350\u00b0C.

The most attractive features of microarrays are throughput and consequently, speed of analysis. The potential for miniaturization with its attendant reduction in sample volume does exist, but is still to be fully realized. This allows DNA microchip technology to have great potential for rapid multiplex analysis of nucleic acid samples. Examples of these include the diagnosis of genetic diseases, detection of infectious agents, measurements of differential gene expression, patient stratification in drug development, drug screening, and forensic analysis (15).",

The target DNAs included multiple fragments of the hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and matrix protein genes. Cy3- or Cy5-labeled fluorescent probes were hybridized to the target DNAs and the arrays were scanned to locate the probe binding site(s). The researchers indicated that the hybridization pattern agreed well with the known grid location of each target and the signal-to-background ratio varied from 5 to 30. No cross-hybridization could be detected. With further testing, this method may prove to be clinically useful. Further differentiation of amplified molecules in complex mixtures can be obtained by hybridizing combinations of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled DNAs.

A long (70 mer) oligonucleotide DNA microarray capable of simultaneously detecting hundreds of viruses was developed. The different viruses were detected by using virally infected cell cultures and related viral serotypes were distinguished by the unique hybridization pattern of each virus. This offers an advantage over existing techniques for screening a broad spectrum of viruses as it allows for the comprehensive and unbiased analysis of viral prevalence in a biological setting. In addition, individual viruses which were not explicitly represented on the microar-ray were detected indicating that this method may find use in virus discovery. An important aspect of this research was the ability to detect multiple viruses in human respiratory specimens without the use of sequence-specific or degenerate primers. This method allows for discrimination among viral subtypes.",

It is more likely that subpopulations identified by the study will be screened retrospectively to establish a logical genetic basis for exclusion of nonresponders and identification of overresponders within the target population (34). This limits the cost associated with development and is less disruptive of the well-established drug development process. A key feature will be the procurement and banking of tissue and/or fluid specimens from patient participants in the study.

A SNP is the most common type of variation in the human genome and it arises as a result of a single base difference in the coded protein between individuals. These variations occur about once every 1000 base pairs in the genome, making up the majority of the three million variations in the genome. Furthermore, the frequency of a particular polymorphism remains stable in the population. Usually, the effect of a single SNP on a gene is not large but small effects can influence susceptibility to common diseases such as Alzheimer's and the risk of heart disease. Oligonucleotide (DNA) chips can be used to discriminate between alternative bases at the site of a SNP. These DNA chips allow many SNPs to be arranged in parallel, which is necessary for large-scale association or pharmacogenomic studies. A DNA sequence containing a SNP is hybridized to a DNA chip and discrimination of alternative bases (termed \u201ctyping\u201d) is carried out at the polymorphic site. The signal that corresponds to the specific identified base is detected.",

Secondly, the oligonucle-otide on the chip may stop one base before the variable site and typing depends on allele-specific primer extension. A DNA sample attached to the chip is used as a template for DNA synthesis with the primer being the immobilized nucleotide. The four nucleotides, to which are added fluorescent labels and DNA polymerase, are also introduced. The incorporated base is identified by the fluorescent signal, although mass spectrometry may also be used. These methods are suitable for high- throughput SNP typing, usually for large-scale studies of populations. Two applications are: (a) association studies, which try to correlate SNP profiles with susceptibility to disease, and (b) pharmacogenomic studies, which link SNP profiles with drug response patterns.

Second, is the challenge of implementing that panel of genes along with suitable analytical controls onto a suitable geneosensor or biochip platform. The first challenge may be defined in part as the challenge of class comparison, that is, the identification of genes that are differentially expressed among the predefined classes of that disease. The first challenge may also be defined in part as the challenge of class prediction, that is, the identification of genes that are differentially expressed among patients for whom the disease outcomes are or may become known. In both cases the technical challenge is exacerbated by the likely emergence of genetic subclasses revealed by the very attempt at class comparison and by the multiple interventions that affect patient outcomes. A looming question then is whether the health care community is prepared to accept a risk based on a deterministic paradigm for health care in an era of molecular diagnostics and personalized medicine.",

At the Center for Bioelectronics, Biosensor and Biochips we are engaged in the development and deployment of a diagnostic and prognostic biochip for primary brain tumors. This biochip seeks to combine a focused panel of genes that is capable of genetically delineating the several World Health Organization (WHO) histopathological classes of primary brain tumors (astrocytomas) with microfluidics technologies that aims to support the several unit operations needed to realize a \u201ctissue-in-data-out\u201d bioanalytical paradigm. Two parallel efforts were established: the conduct of retrospective genetic class comparison, class delineation, and class prediction studies using differential gene expression profiling of tissues taken from the Tissue Data Bank at Virginia Commonwealth University; and the development of electroanalytical techniques that may be suited for rapid hybridization detection of transcripts in a clinical molecular diagnostics format (43).",

The biochip format allows smaller sample volumes to be used. This is relevant when samples are available in very small quantities such as in some tumor biopsies.(iii)\nIntegration of sample preparation. Sample preparation and/or workup are a major source of error and cost in many molecular diagnostics. The ability to integrate these unit operations (such as cell sorting, lysis, protein separation, PCR) onto the same biochip platform is a major advantage.

The potential for a full genomic scan to reveal not just what is currently known about an individual, but also, once entered into a database, that which may be known in the future, not just about an individual but also about their progeny, siblings, and lineage, must dampen enthusiasm for such a genomic screen. The solution is the development of specific gene chips, diagnostic and prognostic biochips that target specific disease states or genetic conditions.

Furthermore, the technology, in its current format, is labor-intensive and quite expensive. There is need for alternative formats that focus on specific diagnostic or prognostic applications within targeted disease states. Better methods of manufacture and detection are being developed, including direct detection of hybridization by electric current, based on the fact that single-stranded DNA conducts electrons at a different rate than double-stranded DNA. In the near future, nucleic acid nanotechnology may prove very useful in DNA diagnostics. Research has led to advanced nucleic acid nanostructures and devices, semisynthetic DNA\u2013protein conjugates, and efficient assembly of individual oligonucleotide-functionalized nanoparticles in two- and three-dimensional networks (53). Some of these assemblies have already proven useful for diagnostic purposes (54, 55) and the construction of nanometer-sized DNA-based nanowires has been achieved (56). The latter have been incorporated into a DNA-based two-dimensional network of functional scaffolds for protein arrays. It will only be a short time before similar DNA arrays are developed.",
