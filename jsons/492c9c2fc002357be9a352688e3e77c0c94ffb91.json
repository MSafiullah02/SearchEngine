The presence of these unusual class 11-restricted CD8+ T cells in CD4-I-mice most likely results from the combined absence of CD4 in these mice and a lack of induction of class I-restricted CTL during MHV-A59 infection[9, 101.    The question is whether these CD8+ class 11-restricted T cells are only present in CD4-I-mice as a consequence of the CD4 null mutation or whether they are a physiological population of cells present in normal mice. If the class IIrestricted CD8+ cells are present only in CD4-'-mice this is probably due to lack of negative selection on MHC class I1 during thymic development. Cells that have a receptor recognizing MHC class I with slight cross-reactivity for class I1 antigens, would be negatively selected in the presence of CD4. In the absence of CD4, however, these cells may survive and give rise to CD8+ T cells, which are responsible for the class 11-restricted response observed in this study. Alternatively, if these class 11-restricted CD8+ T cells are present in wild-type mice, they are probably positively selected by MHC class I1 molecules.
