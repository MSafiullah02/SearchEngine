These include the possibility of redeployment from traditional roles, threats of decreased reimbursement, and a potential decrease in case volume and learning opportunities for trainees. Additionally, there are the new logistic issues surrounding the surgical management of patients during a pandemic, and more widespread use of alternative patient care tools, such as telemedicine.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Difficult choices have been made involving suspension of elective surgeries, with varying adoption across the country, although it has been promoted by the United States Surgeon General and ordered by most state governors.13\n,\n14 The goal of these measures was to preserve the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and hospital resources for the oncoming surge of patients. Indeed, the abundance of personal protective equipment (PPE) varies widely among hospital systems thus rationing and re-use of N95 respirators and surgical masks has become necessary in many hospitals.14\n,\n15\n",

Survey respondents were asked to identify their state of practice, however no further practice site questions were asked, to maintain anonymity. An effort was made to reach vascular surgeons in all geographic regions of the country. The 365 vascular surgeons were compiled from various resources from the authors of the study. To make the survey more representative, emails from under-represented regions were obtained from the Society of Vascular Surgeons website. Surgeons were asked to respond to the survey once. The survey questions and format are illustrated in Figure 1\n. Dedicated line service referred to a vascular access service, or a service with the role of placing invasive lines such as central or arterial lines on critically ill patients.",

            "text": "A limitation of the study is that only a fraction of vascular surgeons in the country participated, and results may not be broadly generalizable. In particular, surgeons practicing in a small community hospital are not well-represented, and the results are heavily skewed toward by responses from academic surgeons, introducing a selection bias. These results must be interpreted with this limitation in mind. There are no physician or hospital identifiers so there is no way to determine the number of hospitals represented by this survey. Moreover, in the interest of keeping the survey short and manageable, many of the answers were kept binary or minimally categorical. While this likely increased response rate, it does not allow for as much granularity in the data obtained. There were also no questions attempting to quantify the financial impact of the crisis for individual surgeons, surgeon layoffs or use of alternative patient care tools, such as telemedicine.. The survey also did not focus on trauma, so the effect on vascular blunt and penetrating trauma was not discerned. The generalizability of the findings may be affected as a result. Moreover, identifying information on respondents versus non-respondents was not collected as anonymity was considered paramount. Finally, these data represent a snapshot in time amid the pandemic and should be interpreted with this in mind.",
