What \u201cimportant\u201d means depends on the particular scenario\u2014what kind of disease spreads and what can be done about it. In the literature, three major aspects of importance have been discussed. First, influence maximization is aimed at identifying the nodes that, if they are sources of the outbreak, would maximize the expected outbreak size \u03a9 (the number of nodes infected at least once) [6,7]. Second, vaccination is aimed at finding the nodes that, if vaccinated (or, in practice, deleted from the network), would reduce the expected outbreak size the most [5]. Third, sentinel surveillance is aimed at finding the nodes that are likely to get infected early [8,9]. These three notions of importance do not necessarily yield the same answer as to which node is most important. In this work, we investigate how the ranking of important nodes for these three aspects differs and why (see Fig. 1).\n",

For epidemiological applications, therefore, it might be interesting if one could immunize people against a disease before an outbreak happens.

On the other hand, degree is not a global quantity\u2014it could happen that the neighbors of a high-degree node are so peripheral that a disease could easily die out there. The simplest way of modifying the degree to become a global measure is to operationalize the idea that a node is central if it is the neighbor of many central nodes. With the simplest possible assumptions, this reasoning leads to eigenvector centrality, i.e., the centrality of node i can be estimated as the ith entry of the leading eigenvector of the adjacency matrix [10]. For the small graphs that we consider, however, the eigenvector centrality is so strongly correlated with degree (intuitively so, because \u201ceverything is local\u201d in a very small graph) that it makes little sense to include it in the analysis.",

This measure is thus in the interval [1,N\u22121], and it increases with i's ability, if removed, to fragment the network. Since vaccination is, in practice, like removing nodes from the network, we expect v to identify important nodes for \u03b2 close to 1. For large graphs, we expect v to be very close to 1, so we only recommend it for small graphs such as the ones we used here. Another popular centrality measure\u2014betweenness centrality (roughly how many shortest paths there are in the network that passes a node) [10]\u2014is very strongly correlated with vitality for our set of small graphs, and it is thus omitted from the analysis.",

For small \u03b2 values, 6 is most important for all three aspects of importance. In this region, the outbreaks die out easily. The fact that 5 and 6 have a larger degree than the others is, of course, helpful for an outbreak to take hold in the population. Node 6 is slightly more important as a seed node since the extra link in its neighborhood helps the outbreak to persist longer [there are the (6,7,4) and (6,4,7) infection paths that, although unlikely, do not exist for diseases starting at 5]. This reasoning also explains why 6 is most important for vaccination. For sentinel surveillance and for low enough \u03b2, the outbreak would typically end by the outbreak becoming extinct rather than hitting a sentinel. Thus, for low \u03b2, when an outbreak has the highest chance of surviving if it starts at 6, then putting in a sentinel is good because an outbreak is either instantly discovered or will likely soon be extinct. With a conditional discovery time \u03c4\u2032, the curves are strictly decreasing (since the early die-off is omitted), so 1 is the most important node for all \u03b2.\n",

If an active node has a high degree, it is likely to be the source of a large outbreak, meaning it is important for influence maximization (which was also concluded by Ref. [13]). If a high-degree node is deleted, it would remove many links that could spread the disease and thus be important for vaccination [25]. It would also be important not to put a sentinel on a low-degree node for sentinel surveillance and low \u03b2 as diseases reaching low-degree nodes would likely die out. So panels Figs. 6(a) and 6(c) can be understood as a shift from nodes of high degree to nodes of high vitality. Closeness centrality\u2014seen in Fig. 6(b)\u2014is harder to explain. Values of c increase with \u03b2 for influence maximization but decrease for vaccination. One way of understanding this is from the observation that vitality is most important for vaccination [as evident from Fig. 6(c)], and degree is most important for influence maximization [as seen in Fig. 6(a)]. The results of Fig. 6(b) then suggest that the high vitality nodes optimizing the solution of the vaccination problem have a lower closeness centrality. Indeed, for many of the graphs we study, the highest vitality node has many degree-1 neighbors\u2014cf. node 5 in Fig. 3\u2014which does not necessarily contribute to the closeness centrality. For influence maximization, it seems that the optimal nodes are central in the closeness sense\u2014the closer to average the seed node is to the rest of the network, the higher is the chance for the outbreak to reach the entire network.",

The order of importance measures are all the same, with vaccination having the largest values, and influence maximization the smallest. It is no longer the case for vaccination that the optimizing nodes have high vitality and low closeness centrality (as it was for n=1). Indeed, for the vaccination case, the optimal nodes are usually independent of \u03b2, which is why the curves for vaccination in Figs. 3(d)\u20133(i) are almost straight. Naively, one would think that some centrality measure needs to increase with \u03b2. However, as we will argue further below, the optimal nodes would usually not be close to each other. One could think of each node being responsible for (and centrally situated within) a region of the network, and that that tendency is so strong that it overrides all simple centrality measures. On the other hand, there are group centrality measures that could perhaps increase with \u03b2\n[26] (that could be a theme for another paper).",
