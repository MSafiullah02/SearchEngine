The blood\u2013ocular barrier system is formed by the blood\u2013aqueous barrier and the inner and outer blood\u2013retinal barrier. It restrictively limits the passage of ions and proteins to maintain homeostasis and to keep tissue-specific antigens sequestrated. Furthermore, many active factors have been discovered in the eye that contribute to a downregulatory immune environment (DIE).2 The blood\u2013ocular barrier and the DIE are mechanisms that depend on each other's proper function. They are central to preserving the immune privilege of the eye. Immune privilege has served well to curb excessive inflammation and preserve function. However, this privilege may be lost under certain conditions and situations, resulting in retinal autoimmunity and ocular inflammation. A dysfunction of the inner blood\u2013retinal barrier initiates diabetic retinopathy.3, 4 A breakdown of the blood\u2013retinal barrier can also be found in cystoid macular edema, while a loss of the DIE is essential to many forms of uveitis and in all probability to the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).5\n",

Moreover, animal optic nerve injury studies revealed possible beneficial roles of retinal autoimmunity in controlling collateral damage to the retinal ganglion cells.7 Thus, retinal autoimmunity can be viewed as a \u201cdouble-edged sword,\u201d with both protective and destructive effects.

It is the first immune response mounted against invading pathogens. The key components of innate immunity are a cadre of leukocytes and plasma proteins that are capable of detecting and destroying pathogens. These leukocytes include polymorphonuclear cells, monocytes, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, eosinophils, and basophils and the plasma proteins belong to families of the complement cascade, clotting cascade, and acute-phase reactants.",

            "text": "In contrast, adaptive immunity, as the name implies, is antigen-specific, adaptive, transferable, and has other cardinal features like immunologic memory and tolerance. Adaptive immunity has evolved and developed novel molecules like the antibody and the T-cell receptor (TCR), which come in almost limitless varieties to recognize most molecules of biological interest, including both self and nonself. These molecules, developed in the absence of exogenous stimulation, have unique configurations that confer specificity in antigen recognition. The key cellular components of adaptive immunity are the T and B lymphocytes which possess unique receptors for recognizing billions of different antigenic epitopes.8 Each clone of lymphocyte expresses molecularly identical receptors on the surface; hence, in order to recognize billions of different epitopes, there are billions of unique lymphocytes. Upon maturation in the thymus (T cells) and the bone marrow (B cells), cells remain quiescent in G0 of the cell cycle until they encounter the complementary antigen of sufficient affinity to their receptors. Binding with the receptors in the presence of appropriate costimulation is the initiating event to trigger an immune response targeting elimination of the complementary molecule. If this molecule is pathogen-derived, activation will lead to the elimination of the pathogen, but if the molecule is self-derived then activation will potentially lead to autoimmunity, tissue injury, disease, and the destruction of host tissue. Activation of naive lymphocytes results in the emergence of clones of lymphocytes through proliferation, each with a unique receptor to recognize one epitope of the inciting antigen. The cytokine environment during activation of naive T cells is responsible for differentiation into three major types of effector T cells. Interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 leads to Th1 cell production, while interleukin (IL)-4 is responsible for Th2 production. Some Th1 and Th2 cell clones will become memory cells which are responsible for the enhanced immune response if the antigen is re-encountered. The rest of Th1 will secrete cytokines targeted at macrophages and other cells mediating cellular immunity. By contrast, Th2 will stimulate B cells into proliferation and antibody production, mediating humoral immunity. Th17 are a recently discovered family of T helper cells that are capable of producing IL-17. IL-1 and IL-23 seem to be needed for human Th17 differentiation.9 Th17 play an important role in combatting various bacterial and fungal species by producing IL-23. In contrast, large amounts of Th17 can be found in autoimmune diseases like uveitis, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis.10\n",

            "text": "The immune response can be seen as analogous to the neural reflex arc, which has an afferent limb, a central process, and an efferent limb. In the immune afferent limb, antigens are captured, processed, transported, and finally presented to the lymphocytes. As the naive lymphocytes can only be activated in the organized lymph tissues in secondary lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes, spleen, tonsils, and Peyer's patches, it needs specialized cells to execute the immune afferent limb. These cells are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Dendritic cells and macrophages, both bone marrow-derived, have APC functions serving to capture antigens through phagocytosis and endocytosis, process the antigens, and present the processed antigen in conjunction with special major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on their cell surface. In addition, the APCs provide the necessary costimulation needed for lymphocyte activation by upregulating an array of surface molecules (CD80, CD86, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, lymphocyte function-associated molecule-3, and CD40) that function as ligands for receptors expressed by the lymphocytes. They also secrete cytokines such as IL-12, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1\u03b2 serving similar costimulation functions. Costimulation is required as the second signal for full activation of the lymphocytes, independent of the first signal, which is the antigen and the lymphocyte receptor engagement.12 There are differences in antigen presentation to B and T lymphocytes. For B lymphocytes, the receptor, which is a surface-bound antibody, can engage a naive antigen directly while TCRs can only recognize peptide fragments presented on special surface molecules (MHC classes I and II). MHC class I, which is present in most cells, presents peptides derived from protein degradation in the cytoplasm (intracellular antigens such as viral and intracellular microbe products), while MHC class II molecules, which are present in APCs and lymphocytes, present peptides from phagocytic vesicles (extracellular antigens from the microenvironment).",

            "text": "Upon activation, the first cells to respond are the CD4+ T cells specific for the presented peptide on the MHC class II molecules of the APCs. The CD4+ lymphocytes will proliferate and secrete an array of cytokines, including IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-4. These cytokines serve as growth and stimulation factors for the lymphocytes and APCs, hence amplifying the proliferation process. In addition, IL-2, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-4 also promote the differentiation of CD8+ T lymphocytes to mature cytotoxic T lymphoctes (CTLs) which recognize antigen-derived peptides presented on class I MHC molecules. Upon activation, these CD8+ CTLs function as effectors to lyse the targeted cells and also produce proinflammatory cytokines, especially IFN-\u03b3. The cytokine production by CD4+ T cells also promotes activation and differentiation of B lymphocytes. IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 stimulate B cells to produce complement-fixing immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, while IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 result in the production of noncomplement-fixing IgG, IgE, or IgA antibodies. The final products after the central processing in the lymphoid tissues are immune effectors. These are the CD4+, CD8+ T cells and B cells that have receptors specific for the inciting antigen. They are transported, predominantly via a hematogenous route, to the site of the inciting antigens to execute their effector function, thereby completing the efferent loop of the immune response. At the target sites, sites of infection and inflammation, vessels are leaky, the vascular endothelial cells display ligands that bind to receptors on the immune cells, and chemokines secreted by the local inflammatory cells serve to attract more immune effector cells to the site. While the engagement and activation of B cells can be direct, activation of the T cells still needs the APCs for antigen recognition. The activated CD4+ T cells secrete cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 which in turn attract and recruit the cells of the innate immune system, such as monocytes, macrophages, and NK cells, to the site to effect the actual destruction of the antigen or pathogen through generation of cytotoxic products and phagocytosis of the pathogens. B cells secrete antibodies specific for an antigen which will result in direct killing/lysis of the target and also recruit polymorphonuclear cells via complement activation and the complement activation products respectively. In this way, the adaptive immune system serves to direct the innate immune system components to target the inciting antigen or pathogen.",

            "text": "The immune system can be regulated at any part of the immune response loop, i.e., afferent limb, central process, and efferent limb. Regulation of the autoimmune response can be via any of the following mechanisms: central tolerance \u2013 clonal deletion and peripheral tolerance \u2013 clonal anergy, T-cell suppression, immune deviation, immunologic ignorance, and antigen sequestration. Since the genome has the capability to generate both self- and nonself-recognizing antibodies and TCRs, mechanisms must be in place to contain and prevent the activation of self-reactive T cells. During lymphocyte development, both T and B cells with receptors that recognize self molecules with high affinity are clonally deleted via apoptosis (central tolerance).13 However the process is not foolproof, as autoreactive T and B cells in the periphery exist even in normal individuals. Many tissue-specific antigens, like the eye-restricted molecules, may not be expressed in the thymus or cells may have escaped the selection process by the central tolerance mechanism in the thymus without encountering the specific self antigen. Hence, the potential for induction and expression of autoimmunity still exists, and mechanisms to contain these autoreactive immune cells are crucial to prevent autoimmunity. Evidence for peripheral tolerance can be found in all phases of the immune response, i.e., afferent limb, central process, and efferent limb.14, 15 The afferent limb depends heavily on the functional properties of the APCs which offer many opportunities for modulation. First, the antigen can be sequestrated and prevented from contact with the APCs by physical barriers or by rendering APCs incapable of antigen capture in the microenvironment (sequestration). Second, the ability of the APC to degrade, process, and express the antigens can be inhibited. Third, the antigen-bearing APCs may be prevented from migrating to the lymphoid tissues. Lastly, the ability of the APCs to generate the costimulatory signal can be inhibited or different costimulatory signals may be produced (immune deviation).",

On encountering the Fas ligand, which is expressed in immuno-privileged eye tissues such as the cornea and retina, these immune cells undergo apoptosis.

There are a large number of bone marrow-derived APCs in the iris, trabecular meshwork, and ciliary body. Studies have demonstrated that antigen captured in the anterior chamber by these APCs is processed in the spleen.48 These APCs reach the spleen via the hematogenous route, bypassing the afferent lymphatics and the lymph nodes. The result is a reduction of the antigen's capacity to activate cell-mediated immune mechanisms. Functionally, these APCs are different. If transferred, these APCs induce ACAID rather than inducing conventional immune responses. The microenvironment of the eye also contains factors such as TGF-\u03b22 that are able to reprogram the APCs from conventional sites, if exposed to the eye microenvironment, to secrete less IL-2, express less CD40 (a costimulatory signal for T-cell activation), and produce more mature TGF-\u03b2. These TGF-\u03b22-treated APCs activate naive T cell to secrete IL-4 and trace amounts of IL-2, but not IFN-\u03b3.49 The spleen is the critical lymphoid organ for the induction of ACAID. In the spleen, a unique population of CD4+ lymphocytes, which secrete IL-2 and TGF-\u03b2 and develop a Th2 immune response upon antigen exposure, is activated. The B-cell response, occurring upon re-exposure to antigen with adjuvant, produces IgG1 isotype antibodies instead of IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3, consistent with a Th2 response.50 There appears to be a concerted effort to deviate the immune response from the usual Th1 pathway to a Th2 pathway, one that is seen in allergic responses. The role of CD95 and its ligand, Fas ligand, is still unclear. It is tempting to speculate that Fas ligand acts by causing active immune cells to apoptose upon engagement, thereby resulting in the elimination of the active immune cells.51 One would expect an upregulation of an inflammatory response if Fas ligand were absent in the eye. Contrary to the predictions, Fas ligand-deficient mice developed less severe inflammation during experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) than wild types.52 Studies using Fas ligand-deficient mice have also revealed that ACAID is dependent on the presence of Fas ligands, as these mice are unable to induce ACAID.53 Hence, Fas\u2013Fas ligand interaction may be more complex than just inducing apoptosis of activated immune cells, as initially presumed.",

As it is the first autoretinal antigen to be implicated in the pathogenesis of uveitis, the sequence and its role in phototransduction have been well characterized.62, 63 It is a highly conserved protein found in the retinal photoreceptor cells and in the pinealocyte. The main function of arrestin is to block the interaction of rhodopsin with the G-protein transducin in the phototransduction cascade. Immunization of susceptible animals (such as Lewis rats but not mice) with S-antigen induces a predominantly CD4+ T-cell-mediated inflammatory response in the retina, uveal tract, and pineal gland. Six peptide fragments of S-antigen have been identified as uveitogenic. There are six regions of S-antigen identified as targets of the T-cell epitopes. One major uveitogenic peptide is M (sequence 303\u2013320). Some of the fragments are species-specific in their uveitogenicity.64 Although the demonstration of uveitogenic properties of S-antigen has helped in the understanding of uveitis mechanisms, the relevance to human uveitis needs to be more fully explored. S-antigen has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of uveitis through molecular mimicry. It has been shown that several exogenous (baker's yeast, Escherichia coli, hepatitis B virus, streptococcal M5 protein, Moloney murine sarcoma virus, and baboon endogenous virus) and endogenous (human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B-derived peptide, tropomyosin) antigens share sequence homology with peptide M of S-antigen.65 Some have been shown to be uveitogenic in the EAU models, and lymphocytes from animals immunized with M peptide cross-reacted and proliferated when stimulated with peptides derived from some of these exogenous or endogenous antigens. Antistreptococcal monoclonal antibodies were found to recognize several uveitogenic peptides of S-antigen, providing further evidence that immunological mimicry between self and exogenous antigens from an infectious agent may be a potential mechanism in the pathogenesis of uveitis in humans.66\n",

However, it is still unclear whether there is an association between the occurrence of eye-specific autoantibodies and lymphocyte proliferation response and clinical disease, and exactly what their roles are in the pathogenesis of human uveitis and other potentially immune-mediated diseases like AMD. Lymphocytes reactive to retinal antigens have been demonstrated in normal individuals4 and those with retinal disease.81 In normal individuals, the presence of circulating autoreactive cells suggests that immunoregulatory mechanisms must exist to prevent retinal autoimmunity resulting in disease; in the latter it is tempting to hypothesize the possible roles of these cells in the induction of retinal autoimmunity. Both the humoral and cellular responses against S-antigen and IRBP have been investigated. T-lymphocyte responses to S-antigen, IRBP, and peptides derived from patients with uveitis were investigated in a few clinical studies. An increase in T-lymphocyte responses was reported in patients with Beh\u00e7et disease during periods of active ocular inflammation.82 In another similar study, a large proportion of the patients had lymphocytes which responded to stimulation with S-antigen, IRBP, and several uveitogenic peptides such as S-antigen peptide M, but no difference was reported in the cellular response between Beh\u00e7et disease patients with and without uveitis.83 Similar cellular responses to S-antigen, S-antigen-derived peptides (peptides M and G), and uveitogenic peptide derived from IRBP (R16) have been reported for patients with idiopathic uveitis.84\n",

            "text": "Retinal autoimmunity may not always be pathogenic. Studies on central nervous system (CNS) injury and its reparative process have revealed a possible beneficial role of autoimmunity in limiting self-injury during insults to the CNS. Axonal injury in the CNS leads not only to the degeneration of the affected axon but also the neighboring axon through self-destructive compounds released by the degenerating axon into the microenvironment.94 Studies have revealed that autoreactive T cells directed against myelin antigens have beneficial effects on CNS myelinated axons after a mechanical crush injury95 and it has been proposed that this neuroprotective activity exhibited by autoimmune T cells may be a physiological process which the body develops to cope with stressful conditions.96 The observation seen in the CNS could be extrapolated to the retina. Supporting this are the findings of a study demonstrating that vaccination with peptides derived from IRBP resulted in protection of retinal ganglion cells from glutamate-induced death or death as a consequence of optic nerve injury.7 It appears that the immune system not only protects the body against invading pathogens but also protects it from toxic substances released by self tissues during trauma and stress. Therefore the autoreactive cells that induce neuroprotection and those that induce autoimmune disease may share the same specificity and phenotype, indicating their potential to be protective and destructive at the same time.97 The final outcome depends on how they are regulated. Correlation between the ability to manifest an autoimmune response with a beneficial outcome and the ability to resist the development of an autoimmune disease in animals has been reported.98 From these findings, it seems clear that the ability to protect the eye from inflammation and injury does not solely depend on mechanisms conferring immune privilege but rather a precise regulation of autoimmunity.",

The possible causative relationship between infections and ocular autoimmunity such as streptococcus, herpesvirus, and Beh\u00e7et disease,99 Gram-negative bacteria, HLA B27-associated uveitis,100 herpesviruses, and serpiginous choroiditis101 has been reported. Infection as an exogenous trigger for inflammation in the eye is an enticing possibility as infections have been linked to the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases such as rheumatic fever,102 inflammatory bowel diseases,103 and sarcoidosis.104 Antiretinal antibodies in the serum of patients with toxoplasmosis retinochoroiditis,105 antiretinal and anti-RPE antibodies in murine coronavirus retinopathy and degeneration106 were reported. These reports provided support for a role of infection in retinal autoimmunity. Even in the current EAU models in animals, bacteria-derived products like mycobacteria in complete Freund's adjuvant, lipopolysaccharides, and pertussis toxin are used to promote the development of autoimmune disease.107 An infection could possibly play a similar role, in sensitizing the immune system to eye-restricted antigens, which are \u201csequestrated\u201d or expressed in low levels below the immune activation threshold. The mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of uveitis may be similar to that of the adjuvant in EAU, including changes in the blood\u2013tissue barrier to allow infiltration of inflammatory cells,108 promotion of Th1 response,109 stimulatory effects on the APCs,110 and enhancement of innate immune response.111 On the other hand, there is evidence that immunologic mimicry may play a role in pathogenesis as molecular homology exists between certain retinal autoantigens and peptides derived from microbes, such as the M peptide derived from S-antigen and the streptococcal cell wall peptide, the yeast's histone peptide, and certain viral agents.66, 112, 113 Molecular mimicry has also been suspected of playing a role in conferring disease susceptibility in patients with certain HLA haplotypes, like HLA B27 for acute anterior uveitis,114 HLA B51 for Beh\u00e7et's disease,115 and HLA-A29 for birdshot retinochoroidopathy.116, 117 Synthetic peptides derived from HLA-B molecules such as B27 and B51 with amino acid sequence homologous with S-antigen have been reported to induce EAU in animals.118 Lymphocytes from patients with uveitis, especially Beh\u00e7et's disease, respond to both peptides derived from HLA-B molecules and peptides derived from S-antigen, demonstrating possible immunologic mimicry.119 In addition, further studies also showed sequence homology between these peptides, rotavirus, and casein protein, a protein found in milk, and cross-reaction in cellular immunity between these peptides was found in animal studies.120 Together these studies bring forward the possibility of immunologic mimicry for exogenous factors like infection or foreign proteins breaking down tolerance and inducing autoimmunity.",

These notions remain as hypotheses for uveitis since it is a heterogeneous disease, and evidence of the initial triggering event is usually difficult to identify due to the protracted course and the delay between trigger and disease presentation.
