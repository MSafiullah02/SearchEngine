Information on use of masks during their history taking; their physical examination; and when they performed procedures that involved contact with body fluid, blood, or an open wound was sought. Information on use of gloves and the type of gloves used was also sought in the latter procedure. Knowledge and perception of the usefulness of the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines13 on handwashing, attitudes toward these guidelines, and perceived risks of cross infection because of noncompliance with hand hygiene practice were sought by a 10-point Likert scale, with 1 indicating total disagreement and 10 indicating maximal agreement to the statement. Information was also sought on whether their colleagues washed their hands according to the guidelines, whether they thought their own practice of handwashing would be taken as an example by their colleagues, whether the guidelines were too difficult to comply with, and whether they thought they could improve on their compliance with hand hygiene.",

The 2003 survey, conducted during the investigation of the SARS outbreak among medical students and other health care workers in mid-March, sought information on their usual personal hygiene practice in the wards before the outbreak was recognized. The 2004 survey partly reflected the impact of SARS on the practice of infection control measures. Good hand hygiene practice involves cleansing hands before and after examining different patients and is a useful measure to avoid the spread of infections. However, studies in several countries showed that the compliance of handwashing was low. Compliance with hand hygiene practice was 16.5% in Rosenthal et al's study9 in Argentina, whereas a range between 4% to 52% have been reported elsewhere.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 The prevalence of good hand hygiene practice among our students in 2003 (33.3%) was low but within this range. The 2004 survey, conducted a year after the SARS outbreak, revealed a significantly higher compliance with handwashing. Several explanations can be given. First, teaching on infection control has been reinforced in the teaching curriculum after the SARS outbreak. Second, health care workers have been issued strict guidelines for infection control and personal hygiene. There was a generally heightened awareness of personal hygiene practices among all levels of health care workers in the hospital and possibly a greater perceived threat to health from a serious disease. All these factors could have influenced handwashing and other personal hygiene practices. However, if the changes in handwashing practice were mainly due to the threat caused by SARS, a retrogression to the pre-SARS practice might occur as the perceived threat wanes.",

            "text": "Proper handwashing practice is associated with a generally positive attitude toward handwashing, as shown by higher (though statistically insignificant) mean scores of intended handwashing behavior (following the guidelines), perceived usefulness of handwashing, and risk of cross infection resulting from noncompliance among those who practiced proper handwashing compared with those who did not. Overall, there were major discrepancies between the students' practice and their knowledge and attitude. Most remembered that they had learned the practice of handwashing and considered it highly useful (9 out of a score of 10) in prevention of cross infection. However, a significant proportion failed to practice proper hand hygiene. Although a change of the students' attitudes toward handwashing and other personal hygiene practice might contribute to better compliance, the underlying reasons for their noncompliance needs to be elucidated. Factors that might have discouraged proper handwashing practice must be identified and addressed. Various suggestions for further improvement in hand hygiene compliance have been made in previous studies on hand hygiene. These include factors at the personal, group, and institutional levels. Handwashing policies, education, and performance feedback on handwashing have been shown to be effective strategies in improving compliance. 9 Alcohol-based handrub has been promoted in Europe.7, 24 The Evidence-based Practice in Infection Control (EPIC) study showed that an alcohol-based handrub provides the most effective decontamination for a wide variety of bacteria and viruses.25 Its use among our students was low (3.8%) compared with using water and antibacterial liquid (84.7%) and water and soap (10.7%), and its use should be widely promoted. Innovative methods such as the use of electronic monitoring and voice prompts have been shown to be useful to enhance the compliance. Swoboda et al26 showed that compliance was also affected by the availability of the reminder signs near the washing facility. In our 2 surveys, we have not investigated the specific factors affecting handwashing practices such as the adequacy of handwashing facilities and the effects of reminder signs in the wards. Recognizing the complexities of handwashing behavior, Pittet8 concluded that \u201ceasy access, availability of hand lotion, alcohol handrub, and solo intervention often fails\u201d and emphasized that \u201cmultimodal, multidisciplinary strategies are necessary.\u201d",

This finding suggests that the practice of handwashing is influenced by peer behavior. One student, in his response to our open-ended question on the reason for noncompliance with handwashing guidelines, stated that he was following what his clinical teacher did. Despite this solitary response, the clinical teacher as a role model might well have influenced the behavior of many more students, a factor not necessarily quoted by students as the most important reason for noncompliance with handwashing practice. The importance of the role model in proper personal hygiene practice has been reported previously.7\n",

This self-centred behavior needs to be addressed, and hand hygiene practice that protects both the patient and the health care worker must be observed. By contrast, the proportions of students using personal protective equipment such as masks in history taking and physical examination of patients and wearing both masks and gloves when performing procedures involving body fluid contact were much higher (ranging from 86% to 100%) than that performing proper handwashing.

One major reason for the discrepancy was that the 2003 survey was part of our effort in the investigation of the SARS outbreak in the hospital, which raised a high level of concern among medical students, many of whom were victims of SARS. This might have accounted for a high response rate in that survey. By contrast, the 2004 survey, specifically designed to ascertain the students' handwashing and personal hygiene practice, might have been perceived as less important than the previous survey. If we assume that the proportion of nonresponding students in 2004 who practiced proper handwashing to be the same as that by respondents in 2003, the overall proportion of students who practiced proper handwashing in the 2004 survey would be 42.7%, still higher than in the 2003 survey (32.5%). If nonresponse was associated with poor handwashing and other personal hygiene practices, our observed difference in the results between the 2 surveys (60.3% vs 32.5%, respectively) could be explained by selection bias. Assuming that all nonrespondents in 2004 did not practice proper handwashing (an unlikely scenario), the true prevalence of proper handwashing practice would have been much lower, at 18%. This would imply a gross failure in the teaching of proper infection control in the hospital.",

To measure the actual behavior, it is necessary to monitor the students' hand hygiene practice and their use of personal protective equipment in the wards. This would necessitate a major change in the study methods from a questionnaire survey approach and is outside the scope of our study. If the true handwashing practice is short of the reported \u201cexpected behavior,\u201d the problem of poor hand hygiene in both surveys would have been even greater. Assuming the same extent of underreporting of true (undesirable) behavior in both surveys, the comparison of the 2 survey results is still meaningful. When we compared the change in handwashing practice among those students who participated in both surveys, there was a substantial improvement in their behavior (20% and 40% improvement in handwashing prevalence before and after examining patients, respectively). However, the sample size was too small to be meaningful. (The 2003 study was targeted at a limited number of students who visited the ward in which the SARS outbreak occurred, whereas the 2004 survey was conducted in August, after the years 4 and 5 students had finished their studies and could not be contacted. Hence, only a few students participated in both the 2003 and 2004 surveys.",
