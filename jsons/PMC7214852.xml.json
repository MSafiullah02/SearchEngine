It was first used as an antifungal, followed by an immunosuppressive agent in organ-transplanted patients and, more recently, also as an anticancer agent [2, 10]. Its cellular target has been named mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) after the name of the compound itself, showing specific activity toward the mTORC1 complex [11]. Rapamycin is also effective in the therapy of the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome [12]. Rapamycin decreases mTOR phosphorylation (mTORC1) [13], causing a downstream perturbation of this signal transduction pathway. The consequent catabolic inhibition and ATP shortage evokes the activation of AMPK [14] and of its substrate ACACA, promoting autophagy, a physiological procedure through which cells recycle old organelles or damaged proteins in order to provide an alternative energy supply [15, 16].",

More recently, CQ has attracted the oncologists for its ability of interfering with the late stages of autophagy, by producing cytoplasmic accumulation of non-functional autophagic vesicles [22]. Both normal and cancer cells utilize autophagy for energetic purposes, but cancer cells, due to their higher energy requirements, rely more actively on autophagy, especially after being stressed by radio- or chemotherapy [23\u201325]. Therefore, the association of first-line therapeutic approaches in cancer patients with autophagy inhibitors has been largely investigated [26, 27] and suggested [26\u201328] and clinically investigated in clinical trials, mainly in CNS tumors [29\u201331].",

Indeed, interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the membrane receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), maximally expressed in lung alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, Leydig cells and Sertoli cells, strongly depends upon glycosylation [36]. CQ also induces alkalization of endosomes, thus inhibiting endocytosis of the viral particles and their enzymatic degradation by proteases [37\u201339], an essential step for the release of functional viral nucleic acid [33].

Tocilizumab has also been approved for the treatment of the cytokine storm associated with cancer immunotherapy [60] or, more often, with CAR-T therapy [61, 62]. This MoAb does not have direct antiviral effects, but effectively contrasts the massive cytokine release syndrome displayed in severe COVID-19 by antagonizing the binding of IL-6, one of the cytokines most involved in this process, to its receptor [58]. After the first report of the effectiveness of tocilizumab in restraining the cytokine storm deriving from SARS-CoV-2 infection [63], this drug is currently under evaluation in a multicenter phase II clinical investigation in Italy on its efficacy and safety in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [64]. The FDA has approved a phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the effectiveness of tocilizumab in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia [65]; in addition an increasing number of clinical trials involving the use of this drug in the treatment of COVID-19 are ongoing (https://clinicaltrials.gov/).",

The activation of the PI3K/AKT\u2013SGK1/mTOR pathway appears fundamental for supporting the replication of various virus species in the host [17\u201320] by boosting their energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species production, especially in the cells of the immune system [101, 102]. Therefore, drugs able to interfere with mTORC1 signaling can produce ATP shortage in the cells in which the virus is replicating, characterized by an excess of energy requirements. Such a metabolic pattern is reminiscent of the peculiar setup of the energy metabolism in cancer cells, i.e. Warburg effect [103, 104], where a pivotal role is played by the PI3K/AKT\u2013SGK1/mTOR signaling cascade [10, 105, 106].",

Anyway, we should always consider that, even if the medications discussed in this review are safely in use in the clinics, the final decision for their administration in COVID-19 for compassionate and urgent use, when in the absence of validated clinical trials, should be taken solely after collegial approval by the clinical team taking care of the patient and under strict clinical surveillance.
