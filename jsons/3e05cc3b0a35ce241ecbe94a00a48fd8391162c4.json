The screening and remediation of diseases of the Gauloise dor\u00e9e, which was contaminated with various Salmonella and Mycoplasma strains, was achieved by successive treatment of parents, incubated eggs and young chicks with Baytril followed by Tiamulin.

Insemination of frozen-thawed semen into females of the same genetic origin or of an egg-type commercial breed produced chicks in every case. For the most subfertile lines, insemination with egg-type females significantly increased the reproductive success.

These methods mainly use DMA or glycerol and 2 different methods of packaging of frozen semen (pellets or straws). Two of these methods were of similar effectiveness: the method using DMA and pellets and the one using glycerol and straws (Tselutin et al., 1999) . The DMA method was much easier to perform because it does not need removal of the cryoprotectant at thawing in contrast to the glycerol method. However, the use of frozen semen from a cryobank requires strict identification of each sample. Pellets are not convenient in these conditions. One of the preliminary experiments of the present study was to prepare a freezing method that combined the use of DMA as cryoprotectant with straws as semen packaging. However, the fertility results of this method were lower than when the glycerol method was used (Table 4 ). Previous works in our laboratory Labb\u00e9 et al., 2003) indicated that straws were less efficient than pellets to restore fertility of chicken or turkey semen frozen with DMA cryoprotectant. This could be due to an effective difference in sperm freezing curve between the 2 procedures (pellets or straws) or to a deleterious interaction between DMA and the plastic of the straws. In the case of normally fertile breeds, the decrease in fertility, which is induced by the use of DMA with straws (compared with DMA with pellets), is not dramatic, and this method may be recommended because it is easier than the glycerol method. However, most of the chicken lines chosen for the present study were subfertile, and our objective was to obtain chicks in every case after semen freezing. The results presented on Table 4 showed that this objective could probably not be fulfilled by the use of DMA and straws.

For the other populations, the fertility results were much lower with homologous females and markedly improved after insemination in heterologous females, indicating that female fertility was also decreased in these populations. This decrease in female fertility was possibly a result of inbreeding (B4 and R+ lines), of metabolic characteristics of the line (R+; Morisson et al., 1997) , or because of marked seasonality and lack of adaptation of the females to the new environment of the experimental facilities (Gauloise dor\u00e9e breed).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 48, "end": 73, "text": "Bihan-Duval et al., 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 74, "end": 93, "text": "Berri et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 94, "end": 115, "text": "Guernec et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 606, "end": 628, "text": "Morisson et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cryobanking Issue"}, {"text": "The second major problem was to ensure the best possible health conditions for semen production, evaluation, storage, and artificial insemination. This is important to avoid transmission of infectious diseases by frozen semen and should be mandatory for the quality assurance of a cryobank. The introduction of the Gauloise dor\u00e9e breed into the cryobank was very interesting in this respect because, in its usual breeding conditions, this breed was contaminated by the legally controlled pathogen bacteria encountered in poultry (Salmonella and mycoplasma). The screening and remediation of diseases of this strain was therefore absolutely necessary and required the treatment of 2 successive generations of animals because of the existence of unaffected carriers and of the potential vertical transmission of pathogens from the dam to the egg. The procedure consisted of repeated treatments with Baytril for the parents followed by Tiamulin for embryos and chicks. Tiamulin was chosen for the second generation because Salmonella and mycoplasma are highly chemosensitive to this drug (Kempf et al., 1988; Cerda et al., 2002) . However, a certain degree of toxicity is possible with Tiamulin injection, particularly for the embryo. The toxicity test for Tiamulin injection in 8-d-old embryos showed a deleterious effect of the injection itself in our experimental conditions, with a mean loss of 30% of hatched eggs. Tiamulin had an additional deleterious effect at a dose of 40 mg/kg. Because of the toxicity of Tiamulin injection to the embryo, a low dose (10 mg/kg) was chosen, which did not result in total eradication of mycoplasma. Further injections and the elimination of chicks resistant to treatment were necessary to ensure total eradication. Technical solutions were thus found but at a high cost.

Our estimation is a minimum cost of 20,000 Euros for a line reared in optimal health and breeding conditions, two-thirds of this cost being due to manpower. The cost reaches 30,000 Euros for a strain of unknown health status requiring a cleaning up procedure. The management of frozen semen straws is much cheaper (300 Euros/line/year). When all other precautions were taken, between 474 and 960 straws of frozen semen were included in the cryobank per line in the present experiment. The difference in number of straws between lines (ratio of 1:2) was mainly related to the biological characteristics of the lines. The rearing conditions were the same for all the males used for semen freezing. However, the Gauloise dor\u00e9e breed was unique. The adult males of this breed had an especially short reproductive period with a short duration of semen production coupled with poor semen quality. One hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that this breed is usually reared in extensive farming conditions and may have retained pronounced characteristics of seasonality that have been lost by most other breeds. Another difficulty with the Gauloise dor\u00e9e breed was the highly unbalanced contributions of the breeders to the final stock of frozen semen. This was due not only to unequal numbers of eggs but also to differences in hatchability and in semen production and quality of adult males.

Blood samples could be used for molecular studies, screening for alleles of a gene of interest, and choosing to use a subset of frozen semen to study new alleles. A wide range of possibilities can be compared that would go beyond the purpose of this paper.
