This can result in either subclinical infection or a combination of respiratory, ocular, gastrointestinal, neurologic and cutaneous signs or lesions, that appear simultaneously or sequentially (Greene and Appel, 1998).

However the unpredictable and variable course of disease such as viremia duration, clinical signs, lack or delayed humoral or cellular immune response, hampers correct diagnosis of CD and makes it crucial to collect samples suitable for laboratory confirmation. By the way, considering the great infectious potential of the disease, the detection of CDV from different biological specimens is essential for determining subsequent patient management.",

However, in this phase the animal shed the virus at high titers in all the body fluids, thus posing a serious threat for other susceptible dogs in close contact with the animal. In such epidemiological circumstances, a wrong or delayed diagnosis of CDV infection may have dramatic consequences. As expected, in the serum samples collected from dog A, CDV-specific antibodies were not detected in virus neutralization, and were rather low in ELISA. These results may be accounted for by the fact that ELISA technique can detect antibodies to all the viral proteins, including the major internal N protein that elicits the highest antibody response in morbillivirus infections (von Messling et al., 1999). This would suggest that it is better to use assays based either on the whole virion or on the N protein when evaluating CDV serological status.",

In dog A, CDV was detected by real-time PCR in blood and urine much more consistently than in the other samples (nasal and conjunctival swabs). However only the urine tested positive in both dogs. Regardless of the clinical stage and form of the illness, urine seems to be the most appropriate sample for diagnosis. Interestingly, as previously reported (Fischer et al., 2013), both the animals were also positive in the rectal swabs, although the duration of shedding of CDV was shorter in the feces than in the urines. Fecal samples are of easier collection in non-clinical settings and can also be used for parallel screening of other gastrointestinal pathogens.",
