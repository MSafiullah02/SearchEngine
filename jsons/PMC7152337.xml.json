Patient-to-patient transmission of infectious agents, directly or indirectly through contaminated devices, equipment, supplies, injectable medications, environmental surfaces, or hands of healthcare personnel have all been demonstrated. Furthermore, hemodialysis patients require frequent hospitalizations and surgery, which increases their opportunities for exposure and risk for developing healthcare-associated infections. This chapter describes (1) the major infectious diseases that can be acquired in the dialysis center setting, (2) important epidemiological and environmental microbiological considerations, and (3) infection control strategies.",

Most are inadequate, especially if they are not routinely disinfected or frequently changed. Particulate filters, commonly called prefilters, operate by depth filtration and do not remove bacteria or endotoxin. These filters can become colonized with gram-negative water bacteria, resulting in higher levels of bacteria and endotoxin in the filter effluent. Absolute filters, including membrane types, temporarily remove bacteria from passing water. However, some of these filters tend to clog, and gram-negative water bacteria can \u201cgrow through\u201d the filter matrix and colonize downstream surfaces of the filters within a few days. Further, absolute filters do not reduce levels of endotoxin in the effluent water.

Manufacturers of the lamp may require routine replacement schedule. Some bacterial populations may develop resistance to UVGI.

If one includes a deionization unit as a polisher (post\u2013reverse osmosis unit) and a storage tank, the final component should be an ultrafilter to remove microorganisms and endotoxin. As the incoming tap water passes through the system components, it becomes more chemically pure, but the level of microbial contamination increases, which is why ultrafiltration and RO are important. Additional components or processes may be included in the pretreatment chain (see Table 25.1) depending on the pH, potable water disinfectant, and chemical quality of the incoming municipal water.

It may also be combined with concentrates at a central location where the resulting dialysis fluid is supplied to the individual machines. Plastic pipe (most often polyvinyl chloride) is then used to distribute water, or dialysis fluids to the dialysis machines. Distribution systems should include the use of a loop-based system and no dead-ended pipes. Outlets to dialysis machines should have a relatively short path with the least amount of fittings and the use of valves with minimal dead space. Voids, dead ends, and large surface areas serve as sites for microbial colonization. Also large diameter pipes decrease fluid velocity and increase the wetted surface area available for microbial colonization. In addition, long pipe runs also increase the available surface area for colonization. Gram-negative water bacteria in fluids remaining in pipes overnight can rapidly multiply and colonize wetted surfaces of the distribution system, producing microbial populations and endotoxin in quantities proportional to the total volume of the surface area. Such colonization results in the formation of protective biofilm, which is difficult to remove and protects the bacteria and other organisms from disinfection.36 Continuous circulation of water slows down this process.37\n",

Single-pass machines tend to respond to adequate cleaning and disinfection procedures and, in general, have lower levels of bacterial contamination than do recirculating machines. Levels of contamination in single-pass machines depend primarily on the microbiological quality of the incoming water and the method of machine disinfection.6, 38 Earlier dialysis machines had a port (waste-handling option) that allowed disposal of the extracorporeal circuit priming fluids. If one-way check valves in the waste-handling option are not maintained, checked for competency, or disinfected as recommended, it allows backflow from the effluent dialysate path into and contamination of the port and the attached bloodline. This led to outbreaks of infections among hemodialysis patients.41, 42, 43 The waste-handling option is much less commonly used now.",

A large outbreak of bloodstream infections caused by Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and other gram-negative bacteria was identified and wall boxes were determined to be the source.47 More work is needed to understand the role of wall boxes and other surfaces and related infection control aspects in transmission of pathogens.",

This decline coincides with decisions made by several large dialysis organizations to discontinue the practice of reuse and to only use single-use dialyzers. Although dialyzer reuse is still common in developing countries, it has become less popular in developed countries and some have plans to phase out this practice.50, 51 After a series of outbreaks of bacterial infections associated with reuse and reprocessing of dialyzers, CDC recommended that single use of dialyzers be the preferred practice and stated that it should be used whenever possible.52\n",

Manual reprocessing of dialyzers, which is allowed in the United States, does not include testing for membrane integrity, such as a pressure-leak test, may fail to detect membrane defects, and relies on disinfection processes that are particularly difficult to standardize.54, 55\n",

In most instances the water used to rinse dialyzers or to prepare the dialyzer disinfectants exceeded the allowable AAMI microbial or endotoxin standards, because the water distribution system was not disinfected frequently, the disinfectant was improperly prepared, or routine microbial assays were improperly performed. Several outbreaks associated with dialyzer reuse have been reported. Breaches in disinfection of dialyzer components (such as an O-ring) and contamination caused by poor infection control practices during reprocessing steps have been identified as major contributors to those outbreaks.52, 57, 58, 59 In at least one outbreak, no major breaches in reprocessing were identified. Rather, it was determined that dialyzers are difficult to reprocess safely and completely under typical conditions.

Because the bicarbonate concentrate will support rapid growth,60 its use can increase microbial and endotoxin concentrations in the dialysate and theoretically may contribute to an increase in pyrogenic reactions, especially when used during high-flux dialysis.",

Adequate cleaning may be difficult if there are multiple wires, tubes, and hoses in a small area. There should be enough space to move completely around each patient\u2019s dialysis station without interfering with the neighboring stations. According to the Facility Guidelines Institute, each dialysis station should be at least 80 square feet and allow at least 4 feet distance between stations to avoid contamination.111 However, most of dialysis facilities do not have space to meet that guideline. To avoid contamination, cleaning should only start when patients have left the station and staff should not allow new patients into chairs until cleaning and disinfection is complete. Creating unit-wide patient-free intervals between treatment shifts is likely to improve the adequacy of station cleaning and disinfection between patients.",

Facilities that implemented this set of interventions were able to reduce their access-related BSI rates and sustained these lowered rates for at least 4 years.150 The core interventions include (1) BSI surveillance using NHSN and feedback to clinical staff; (2) hand hygiene observations with feedback to staff; (3) catheter/vascular access care observations to ensure clinical staff adherence to aseptic technique and good infection control practices (with staff feedback); (4) development of staff infection prevention skills, demonstrated through competency assessments; (5) patient education and engagement in infection control processes; (6) decrease catheter prevalence; (7) catheter hub disinfection; and (8) bacitracin zinc/polymyxin B sulfate (Polysporin) triple ointment or povidone-iodine ointment applied to catheter exit sites. The CDC has also developed tools, protocol, and guidance to assist in the implementation of the interventions (https://www.cdc.gov/dialysis/prevention-tools/index.html).",

Influenza vaccination is associated with lower risk for hospitalization and death in ESRD patients.170 Although transmission of influenza, even during pandemics, in US dialysis clinics is not evident through the published literature, anecdotal reports of transmission exist. Because of their higher risk for complications, it is important to maintain influenza vaccination coverage among hemodialysis patients. In addition to influenza vaccination for patients, vaccination for dialysis providers (clinicians, nurses, technicians) is also important. Vaccination for healthcare personnel has been found to decrease absenteeism and healthcare-facility acquired influenza.171, 172, 173 However, coverage among dialysis healthcare personnel was still suboptimal: data indicated that only 73% of healthcare personnel in dialysis clinics received influenza vaccination in the 2011\u20132012 season.174 Annual vaccination is therefore recommended for both dialysis patients and healthcare personnel.169\n",

In a review of USRDS (Medicare claims) data between 2005 and 2008, 4.25% of dialysis patients were diagnosed with first episode of CDI.202 In a cohort of dialysis patients followed from 1999 to 2007, 14.3% of hemodialysis patients developed CDI (a rate of 8.3 cases per 100 patient-years).203 The UK Renal Registry reported an incidence of 1.09 CDI per 100 patient-years among hemodialysis patients in 2013\u20132014.204 An outbreak of CDI in a hemodialysis facility has been reported. The outbreak investigation revealed several challenges in prevention and control of CDI among dialysis patients (e.g., shared patient environment and equipment, lack of physical barriers between patient treatment stations, and adequacy of typical cleaning and disinfection procedures).205 CDI control strategies that were employed during this outbreak included designation of select dialysis stations as CDI contact isolation stations, use of dedicated, disposable gown and gloves by staff while caring for a patient in contact isolation, handwashing with soap and water after caring for CDI patients, use of 1:10 dilution of bleach to disinfect environmental surfaces in stations after treatment of CDI patients, and heightened diligence to ensure adequate wet contact time of bleach on surfaces.",

For certain patients, including those infected with MRSA or VRE, contact precautions are used in the hospital setting.162 The CDC has not recommended routine use of contact precautions in hemodialysis centers for patients infected or colonized with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). Transmission of pathogenic bacteria is well documented in hospitals. At least one study has suggested that the majority of transmission and acquisition of resistant pathogens among dialysis patients occurs when these patients are admitted to the acute care setting.186 However, studies have demonstrated MDRO spread in dialysis centers.205, 206 The CDC recommends additional precautions be used during treatment of patients who might be at higher risk for transmitting pathogenic bacteria (i.e., those with an infected skin wound with drainage that is not contained by dressings or fecal incontinence or uncontrolled diarrhea). These interventions include the following: (1) Staff members treating the patient should wear a separate gown over their usual clothing and remove the gown when finished caring for the patient; (2) patients should be dialyzed at a station away from the main flow of traffic and with as few adjacent stations as possible (e.g., at the end or corner of the unit).162 However, preventing transmission of resistant pathogens depends primarily on adherence to basic infection control practices and these additional practices. More work is needed to understand the transmission of targeted MDROs in dialysis settings and the effectiveness of interventions to reduce transmission.",

Investigation of an outbreak involving four different clusters found multiple lapses in infection control and blood contamination of environmental surfaces as a result of poor cleaning and disinfection practice.46 In these outbreaks, a single common exposure event is rarely identified, and many outbreaks involve separate chains of transmission occurring over time. Moreover, it has been noted that station turnover procedures are rushed and disinfection of machine surfaces is initiated before the patient has left the treatment station. These common practices are challenges to proper cleaning and disinfection and prevention of cross-transmission of bloodborne pathogens such as HCV.",

HIV is transmitted by blood and other body fluids that contain blood. No patient-to-patient transmission of HIV has been reported in a US hemodialysis center. However, there have been reports of transmission of HIV among patients in other countries. All these outbreaks have been attributed to several breaks in infection control: (a) reuse of access needles and inadequately disinfected equipment, (b) sharing of syringes among patients, and (c) and sharing of dialyzers among different patients.293, 294, 295, 296, 297 The most recent reported outbreak involved three new HIV infections and was associated with sharing of multidose heparin vials, inadequately disinfected hemodialysis equipment, and dialysis staff who used blood-contaminated gloves to manipulate vascular access for multiple patients.298 Adherence to recommended infection control practices is adequate to prevent HIV transmission in dialysis facilities.162\n",
