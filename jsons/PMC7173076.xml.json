Initial analysis of this chicken-origin parvovirus (ChPV) revealed that it is a novel member of the Parvovirinae subfamily within the Parvoviridae, and led to the development of a specific molecular diagnostic test targeting the ChPV non-structural (NS) gene (Zsak et al., 2009).",

Parvoviruses are well known for causing enteric disease in mammals, with the canine parvoviruses recently emerging as important pathogens in the 1970s (Decaro et al., 2009, Truyen, 1999). Parvoviruses have been known for years as the causative agent of Derzsy's disease in young geese, and are also found in Muscovy ducks, where they cause multiple clinical signs ranging from enteritis to hepatitis and infectious myocarditis (Gough, 2008). Parvoviruses have been previously described in chickens based upon their morphology via electron microscopy and upon their genome size (Kisary et al., 1985, Kisary et al., 1984), and enteric disease signs have been attributed to parvovirus-like particles detected in turkey intestinal tracts (Trampel et al., 1983). A recent diagnostic survey of enteric samples collected from United States turkey and chicken flocks revealed widespread presence of parvovirus in U.S. poultry (Zsak et al., 2009). This is the first in-depth molecular characterization and analysis of the full-length genome sequence of ChPV. The analysis includes comparisons to other members of the Parvovirinae that infect mammals and birds, including two novel turkey-origin parvoviruses (TuPV) recently sequenced using a similar molecular approach.",

The overall genomic organization of ChPV ABU-P1 is similar to other parvoviruses, with two major predicted open reading frames (ORFs). The 5\u2032 ORF is 2085 nt long, and a blastx search using the putative amino acid sequence revealed a protein similar to the Parvoviridae non-structural (NS) proteins NS1, with the greatest similarity to human bocavirus NS1. The major 3\u2032 ORF is 2028 nt long, and encodes a protein similar to the Parvoviridae capsid protein VP1, with the greatest similarity to avian adeno-associated virus, a member of the Dependovirus genus. The ChPV genome also contains a small (306 nt) ORF located between the major 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ORFs. This ORF shows no homology to known protein coding regions in the databases.",

The predicted VP1 start codon (ATG) overlaps with the stop codon (AAT) of the predicted 306 nt ORF located between the ChPV NS1 and VP1 ORFs. VP1 is preceded upstream by a TATA box and a polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) follows the ORF; this poly-A signal immediately precedes the 39 nt inverted repeat at the 5\u2032 end of the genome. One of two downstream ATG codons that begin 417 and 420 nt downstream to the start of the putative VP1 ORF may serve as the start codon for a VP2 capsid protein that shares a stop codon (TAA) with VP1. The second of these ATG codons has the stronger Kozak consensus sequence (ATGATG\nG) compared to the translation initiation context of the first codon (GAAATG\nA) and remains in frame (Kozak, 1987). A third start codon with a favorable translation initiation context (GACATG\nG) is present at position 3067 in the ChPV genome, and may represent the beginning of a putative VP3 ORF as has been described in the goose and Muscovy duck parvoviruses (Zadori et al., 1995).

Small viral particles (15 to about 25 nm) resembling parvovirus have been identified for years in the intestinal tracts of poultry (Kisary et al., 1984, Trampel et al., 1983, Woolcock and Shivaprasad, 2008). The use of a particle-associated nucleic acid (PAN) sequencing technique has recently allowed the partial molecular characterization of this novel ChPV (Zsak et al., 2008), and led to the identification and sequencing of two additional avian parvoviruses from turkeys: TuPV 260, originally detected in the intestinal tract of a turkey from California, and TuPV 1078, originally detected in the pooled intestinal tracts from a North Carolina turkey farm. All three of these poultry isolates are very similar to each other, yet each differs significantly from other members of the Parvovirinae. The high amino acid identities noted among the turkey and chicken isolates suggests that they diverged at sometime in the recent past from a common ancestor. It is known from studies of another member of the Parvovirinae, canine parvovirus (CPV), that the parvoviruses, despite their single-stranded DNA genome, have a mutation rate that approaches that of RNA viruses, which allows rapid evolution and host adaptation (Hoelzer et al., 2008, Shackelton et al., 2005). Interestingly, ChPV and TuPV do not group phylogenetically with the parvoviruses that infect geese (GoPV) and Muscovy ducks (MdPV), parvoviruses that are closely related to adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV-2), a member of the Dependovirus genus (Fig. 3) (Zadori et al., 1995, Zsak et al., 2008). Further, the ChPV NS protein shares only 19.1% amino acid identity with the MdPV NS protein.",

This motif is required for pathogenesis in the human parvovirus B19 and is found in many parvovirus isolates (Momoeda et al., 1994). The 5\u2032 major ORF of ChPV appears to encode the viral capsid proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3.

Kisary) was propagated in specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens as described previously (Kisary, 1985, Zsak et al., 2009). A sequence-independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was employed to amplify particle-associated nucleic acid (PAN) present in ChPV ABU-P1-positive chicken intestinal homogenates, and has been described elsewhere in detail (Zsak et al., 2008). The randomly amplified PAN was ligated into the TOPO-TA cloning vector (Invitrogen) and the ligation mix was used to transform competent TOP-10 E. coli cells (Invitrogen). Using this approach, a total of 768 clones were identified and sequenced using the M13 forward and reverse primers on an AB-3730 automated DNA sequencer. The sequenced clones were used as query sequences to search the GenBank non-redundant nucleotide (nr/nt) database using the blastn algorithm and the non-redundant (nr) protein database using the blastx algorithm. Four contigs with an average of eight-fold coverage and lengths of 1417 nt, 933 nt, 1069 nt, and 739 nt were assembled from 27, 24, 19, and 21 clones, respectively. These contigs had no significant nucleotide similarity to database sequences, but the deduced amino acid sequence from each contig revealed significant similarity to the members of the family Parvoviridae in the database. PCR primers were designed using the four assembled contigs and were subsequently used to close gaps of 58, 443, and 205 nt between the contigs and assemble the complete ChPV ABU-P1 genome. The right terminal region of contig 4 contained a portion of the right inverted terminal repeat (ITR). Primers designed using this partial ITR used in combination with forward and reverse primers within contig 1 (left terminal region of the genome) and contig 4 resulted in the cloning of the ITR regions at both the right and left genomic termini.",
