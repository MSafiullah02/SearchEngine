These two classes of proteolytic enzymes share an acyl transfer mechanism of the peptide bond cleavage involving the nucleophilic attack of the active site serine hydroxyl and cysteine thiolate nucleophile, respectively, at the carbonyl carbon of the scissile bond (Fig. 1\n). Specificity of proteases is generally achieved through defined interactions of amino acid residues and certain subsites at the active site. The small size of fluorescent coumarins suggests their incorporation into the side chain of amino acids and the generation of fluorescent peptides. Internally quenched fluorescent (IQF) peptide substrates make use of this option. They consist of a fluorophore, e.g. a coumarin, and a quencher moiety, separated by several amino acids. Proteolytic cleavage of any peptide bond within this portion leads to a loss of quenching and the concomitant generation of fluorescence. Such IQF peptides have frequently been employed for the positional profiling of protease substrates to perform an active-site mapping and to elucidate substrate specificity [9].",

            "text": "In addition to the utilization of coumarins for the reconstruction of specificity profiles for serine and cysteine proteases, this review will also highlight the role of coumarins as structural components of activity-based probes (ABPs). Serine and cysteine proteases, both of which are characterized by a covalent mode of catalysis, are particularly suitable to be targeted by ABPs. These probes elicit an irreversible inhibition of the protease because the nucleophilic attack is directed to an electrophilic moiety of the probe, the so called warhead. The sulfur of a cysteine protease represents a soft nucleophile and thus prefers soft electrophiles such as acyloxymethyl ketones, epoxysuccinates and Michael acceptors. In contrast, the serine proteases favor harder electrophiles like phosphonates or isocoumarins [13]. Next to the warhead, ABPs contain two further parts, a spacer and a tag (Fig. 2\n). The highest impact on the specificity of an ABP is caused by the spacer, which can consist of a well-accepted peptidic recognition unit. The tag permits the detection of the inhibited protease, either through biotin or fluorescent reporters, among which cyanines, fluoresceins, boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivatives and coumarins have been frequently employed [14]. The introduction of the latter fluorophore into ABPs for serine and cysteine proteases will be considered in this review. We will not discuss the detection and quantification of inorganic ions or low-molecular weight thiols by means of coumarin-containing probes, which has comprehensively reviewed elsewhere [11].",

The aromatic character of coumarin was confirmed by topological resonance energy and nucleus independent chemical shift values and calorimetric measurement [15,16]. Thiocoumarin, in which the ring oxygen is replaced by sulfur, is somewhat more stable [15], similar to the comparison of 4H-3,1-benzoxazin-4-ones and 4H-3,1-benzothiazin-4-ones [17]. Hydrolysis of coumarins at high pH produced cis-coumarinic acids, and lactonization of this species occurred at low pH. Coumarin (1, Fig. 3\n) had a half-life of 160 min at pH 10 and 25 \u00b0C [18]. A 7-methoxy and, more pronounced, 7-diethylamino substitution of 4-methylcoumarin led to a reduced reactivity in alkaline hydrolysis [19], whereas introduction of an electron-withdrawing phenyl group at position 3 accelerated this reaction [20].",

The primary amines 5\u20137 are well established moieties for fluorogenic peptide substrates. Fluorescence is generated only when the 7-aminocoumarin is released from the 7-peptidylcoumarin through the protease-catalyzed hydrolysis of the amide bond.

In coumarin 343 (8), longer wavelengths of excitation (440 nm) and emission (480 nm, in aqueous solution) appear [27]. The extension of the \u03c0-electron system due to coupling in position 3 with a heteroaryl substituent and sulfonation at position 6 resulted in a bathochromic shift, high quantum yield and good water solubility of the resulting dye 9 with an absorption maximum of 426 nm and an emission maximum of 481 nm (in aqueous solution) [10].",

In 1921, Schofield and Roderick independently discovered, that the disease was caused by hay contaminated with the sweet clovers Melilotus alba and Melilotus officinalis and thus was named sweet clover disease [38]. Putrefactive bacteria in the hay, such as Aspergillus fumigatus led to the formation of dicumarol (12, Fig. 5\n) [39]. This coumarin dimer turned out to be a VKOR inhibitor, hence decreasing antithrombotic proteins. In 1941, dicumarol was established as anticoagulant and was the first approved coumarin-containing drug [38]. The coumarin derivatives phenprocoumon and warfarin are still on the market as VKOR inhibitors.",

The trypsin-like serine protease factor XIIa operates as the starting point for the intrinsic pathway of the secondary hemostasis. FXIIa activates plasma kallikrein which produces an amplification loop of FXII activation. In the coagulation cascade, factor XIIa ultimately leads to the activation of factor X to Xa, which itself activates, together with factor Va, prothrombin. Coumarin derivates of the anilide type 13 and 14 (Fig. 5) have been described as active site-directed factor XIIa inhibitors. Both compounds show activity with IC50 values of 4.3 \u03bcM [41] and 5 \u03bcM [42]. The halogens from the fused benzene ring of 14 are assumed to point to a tyrosine residue of a hydrophobic region within the active site of factor XIIa and the para-chlorophenol ring to extend towards the entry of the S1 pocket. The lactone function may contribute to binding by forming hydrogen bonds [42]. Both representative inhibitors were selective for factor XIIa over the related enzymes thrombin, factor Xa, factor VIIa, and plasma kallikrein [41,42].",

In contrast, coumarins of type 15\u201317 are thought to display a different interaction with target serine proteases. Studies of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick et al. have been focused on the inhibition of the trypsin-like enzymes factor Xa and thrombin by such coumarins [[43], [44], [45]]. Factor Xa acts in the clotting cascade by converting prothrombin into thrombin in the presence of phospholipids and calcium. Factor Xa is a connecting link between internal and external ways of coagulation. Factor Xa inhibition has become a particular successful strategy in the development of new anticoagulants. Thrombin represents the terminal serine protease of the blood clotting cascade. It acts as a stimulator of platelet activation and as the direct converter of the glycoprotein fibrinogen to fibrin. Thrombin amplifies its own generation by feedback activation of factors V, VII and IX. Moreover, thrombin also activates factor XIII by cleaving an activation peptide segment. The resultant transglutaminase introduces the covalent crosslinks into the fibrin clot [46]. Compound 15 show a pronounced inhibition of chymotrypsin [47], rather than of thrombin and factor Xa. Coumarin 16 exhibited a second-order rate constant of thrombin inactivation of 37,007 M\u22121 s\u22121. Activity against chymotrypsin was reduced in the order 15 to 17, and the latter compound was more potent against thrombin (k\ni/K\ni = 3457 M\u22121 s\u22121) than against chymotrypsin [45]. The introduction of a para-guanidino group into the phenoxy part of such coumarins led to water soluble derivatives [48].",

The circulating enzyme seems to conduct an auto-activation, which is triggered through ingredients of damaged cells and on positively and negatively charged macromolecules [62,63]. Once activated, FSAP can be inhibited by several endogenous inhibitors such as \u03b11-proteinase inhibitor, \u03b12-plasmin inhibitor, antithrombin, C1 inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 [64]. The activated FSAP was reported to cleave single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scuPA) and several other substrates, such as platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor/epidermal growth factor, histones, high-molecular-weight kininogen and protease activated receptor-2 [62,63,65]. Since the physiological role of FSAP is not fully understood and the significance of certain substrate cleavages has been questioned, knowledge of its substrate specificity and defined peptide substrates to specifically measure FSAP activity in the plasma are required.",

The assays were monitored fluorimetrically with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. The preferred P4-P1 sequence was Ala-Lys-Nle-Arg and the corresponding fluorogenic substrate Ac-Ala-Lys-Nle-Arg-AMC exhibited a k\ncat/K\nm value of 26,300 M\u22121 s\u22121 and a high selectivity for FSAP compared to thrombin, plasmin, FXa, uPA, tPA, FXIIa. After addition of histones to plasma, turnover of this substrate was accelerated, reflecting the histone-mediated activation of pro-FSAP [64]. Rut et al. obtained a synthetic FSAP substrate by means of a HyCoSuL with arginine fixed in P1 position and 19 natural and 108 unnatural amino acids in P2-P4 position. ACC was used as fluorophore [66]. Excitation was conducted at 320 nm and the emission was measured at 460 nm. The best identified substrate, Ac-Pro-d-Tyr-Lys-Arg-ACC, showed k\ncat/K\nm values of 55,045 M\u22121 s\u22121 and 17,833 M\u22121 s\u22121 for the protease domain (amino acids 292\u2013560) of wild-type FSAP and plasma FSAP, respectively (Fig. 7\n). Based on these outcomes, a biotin and a cyanine-5 (Cy5) containing ABPs were designed. For this purpose, the coumarin moiety was exchanged for a diphenyl phosphonate whereby the electrophilic phosphorous atom, in place of the carbonyl carbon, forms a covalent bond to the \u03b1\u2011carbon of the P1 arginine. The probe was assembled through the introduction of the linker-connected biotin or Cy5 substructure at the N-terminus of the peptide. A nucleophilic attack of the active-site serine at the warhead's phosphorous leads to irreversible inhibition and labeling of the target protease [66]. This prototypical stepwise approach towards an ABP starting from the identification of a preferred amino acid sequence has frequently been demonstrated. Examples include ABPs for cathepsin G [[67], [68], [69]], human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and proteinase-3 [70], the major secreted serine proteases of neutrophils and mast cells.",

            "text": "Matriptase-2 (MT-2), a member of the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs), is mainly expressed in the liver. It shares the primary substrate specificity for basic amino acids in P1 position with FSAP and other trypsin-like serine proteases. MT-2 cleaves membrane-bound hemojuvelin, the co-receptor of the bone morphogenic protein (BMP) receptor, resulting in a decreased activation of the SMAD signaling cascade and in a reduced expression of the hepcidin gene. Hepcidin, through interaction with ferroportin, acts as a regulator of the intestinal iron absorption. Accordingly, high activity of MT-2 results in increased iron uptake and MT-2 was considered as a target for the treatment of iron overload diseases and \u03b2-thalassemia [71,72]. ACC-containing peptides were used to elucidate the substrate specificity of MT-2 with respect to the P4-P1 positions. Deconvolution of the applied library provided Ile-Arg-Ala-Arg to comprise the sequence best accepted by MT-2 [73]. By dint of this outcome, the substrate specificity for the positions P1\u00b4-P3\u00b4 was evaluated. By using PS-SCL, IQF heptapeptides were designed, in which positions P1-P4 were occupied by the before determined sequence. N-terminal 2-aminobenzoic acid (Abz) and C-terminal 3-nitrotyrosine were introduced as fluorescence donor and acceptor, respectively. After excitation at 320 nm, cleavage of the substrate after the P1 arginine (underlined) resulted in a rise of fluorescence at 450 nm, because of the henceforward absence of quenching. The best specificity was observed for Abz-Ile-Arg-Ala-Arg-Ser-Ala-Gly-Tyr(3-NO2)-NH2 with a k\ncat/K\nm value of 454,200 M\u22121 s\u22121 [73]. B\u00e9liveau et al. incorporated the filaggrin-derived octapeptide Arg-Lys-Arg-Arg-Gly-Ser-Arg-Gly into an IQF substrate which possessed a k\ncat/K\nm value of 230,000 M\u22121 s\u22121 for MT-2 [74].",

            "text": "The human serine protease dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is expressed in several tissues and organs and occurs as membrane-associated or secreted enzyme. It cleaves and inactivates the incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP). Incretins constitute metabolic hormones that stimulate, in the presence of high glucose levels, the secretion of insulin from pancreatic beta cells and inhibit the release of glucagon, leading to a downregulation of blood glucose concentration. Accordingly, DPP4 plays a crucial role in glucose homeostasis, and DPP4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, are used in the treatment of type-II diabetes mellitus [75]. DPP4 cleaves N-terminal dipeptides from polypeptides with a proline residue at the penultimate, i.e. P1, position. In order to identify new DPP-4 inhibitors, a suitable sensitive assay for a high-throughput screening is required. A commonly applied principle makes use of fluorescent coumarinyl dipeptides with a free amino group, e.g. H-Gly-Pro-AMC [76]. Kawaguchi et al. discussed disadvantages of such substrates, such as the excitation by a short wavelength and the short fluorescence life-time. Since the material of microplates scatters short wavelength light, undesirable interferences may occur. To overcome these limitations, a time-resolved fluorescence probe containing an aza-coumarin was developed (Fig. 8\n). The probe contains a lanthanide and is characterized by a large Stokes shift and a long luminescence lifetime, so the short background signals are negligible, resulting in an increased sensitivity for HTS. The substrate's strong luminescence is decreased after cleavage through acceptor-excited photo-induced electron transfer (PeT). The k\ncat/K\nm value of this probe for DPP4 (850,000 M\u22121 s\u22121) is similar to that of H-Gly-Pro-AMC (760,000 M\u22121 s\u22121) [77]. Likewise, a ratiometric two-photon fluorescent probe to monitor DPP4 was developed, based upon the cleavage of H-Gly-Pro-OH from 6-amino-2-butyl-1H-benzo[de]isoquinoline-1,3(2H)-dione [78].",

LonA features an AAA domain and a proteolytic domain. The AAA domain forms oligomeric ring structures, and substrates are led through this pore into a separate chamber, where they are consumed by the proteolytic domain. Lon proteases are responsible for the degradation of more than 50% of the bacterial misfolded proteins. Even some sequences of cleavage sites are known, the modality of substrate recruitment is not well understood [79]. Because the Lon proteases play important roles in biofilm formation and stress tolerance, and inhibitors reduce colonization and virulence, Lon protease is a promising target for new antibiotics. Lon proteases are serine proteases but possess a serine-lysine dyad, in contrast to most serine proteases with a catalytic triad [80]. The majority of Lon-protease inhibitors exhibits no selectivity and interacts with a huge number of serine proteases. Babin et al. introduced a well-tolerated substrate with high selectivity for Lon protease by using a HyCoSuL. Deconvolution led to the substrate Ac-hArg-nptGly-Phe-ACC with a k\ncat/K\nm value of 25,000 M\u22121 s\u22121. Neopentylglycine on P2 and homoarginine in P3 position resulted in selectivity over other serine proteases. The collected data were used for the assembly of an irreversible inhibitor. A boronic acid was inserted as a warhead, forming a covalent bond with active-site serine, and pyrazine-2\u2011carbonyl as capping group at the N-terminus to create a Pyz-hArg-nptGly-Leu-B(OH2) [81].",

The protein NS2B is integrated in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. NS2B contains a hydrophilic part, essential for the non-covalent interaction with the serine protease NS3. Together they form the complex NS2B-NS3, which plays a crucial role in virus replication. The viral genome encodes a single polyprotein, which is cleaved into structural and non-structural proteins by host proteases and NS2B-NS3 itself [82,83]. NS2B-NS3 gets more and more in the focus as a promising drug target. By means of an ACC-based HyCoSuL, Rut et al. evaluated the substrate specificity of the P1-P4 positions with 19 natural and 108 unnatural amino acids for the positions P2-P4 and with 139 natural and unnatural amino acids for the P1 position.

By considering these mapping approaches as well as selectivity requirements, ABPs for flaviviral proteases have been developed which share the characteristic dibasic recognition motif (Fig. 9\n).

Its signal peptide guides the protein to the rough endoplasmatic reticulum, where the short sequence is removed forming procathepsin B. The mature enzyme is generated through autocatalytic activation. The protease features endopeptidase and dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase activity, depending on the translocation of the occluding loop to form an open and closed conformation, respectively. Cathepsin B has been identified as an important tumor-promoting factor. In several cancer types, the enzyme is overexpressed and responsible for the activation of other proteases and the breakdown of the extracellular matrix (ECM), either by extracellular proteolysis catalyzed by the secreted enzyme or after internalization of ECM components, leading to tumor migration, proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Cytosolic cathepsin B plays a role in cell death by promoting apoptosis, triggered by the activation of caspases 3 and 9 [58,86,88]. Since cathepsin B expression is elevated in cancer cells, its proteolytic activity can be addressed for prodrug activation and drug delivery [89,90]. Such approaches can make use of coumarin fluorescence. For example, a prodrug system was designed with a dipeptide trigger and a coumarin linker. After proteolytic cleavage, a disassembling cascade was initiated resulting in the release of the anti-cancer drug melphalan and the emergence of the coumarin fluorescence [91].",

Okorochenkova et al. constructed a three-fluorophore system including a cleavage site for a trypsin-like protease (Ala-Lys-Ala) and a chymotrypsin-like protease (Ala-Phe-Ala, P1 amino acids are underlined) in a single compound. The authors introduced a coumarin amino acid of type 10 (n = 4, X = N(Et)2, Fig. 3) C-terminal of the Ala-Lys-Ala motif, fluorescein between both motifs, and rhodamine B N-terminal of the Ala-Phe-Ala motif. This substrate employs a double-FRET mechanism. Following excitation of the coumarin at 435 nm and collecting the three emission signals of coumarin, fluorescein and rhodamine B, it was possible to detect and distinguish the activity of one or two proteases or their mixture. For example, in the presence of chymotrypsin and under excitation of the coumarin, energy transfer to fluorescein and a time-dependent increase of the fluorescein fluorescence occurred, which made ratiometric analyses possible [107].",

Upon stimuli, the NSPs are released into the phagosome and the extracellular space or associated to the plasma membrane. After fusion of azurophilic granules with vacuoles carrying phagocytosed bacteria, NSPs function in intracellular host defense by degrading bacterial proteins. Once released into the extracellular space, NSPs are responsible for the destruction of proteins of the extracellular matrix including elastin, laminin, type IV collagen and fibronectin. Hence, they participate in neutrophil migration, and are also able to activate or inactivate cytokines.

The following peptide sequence was employed for a MMP-2 substrate, Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Val-Arg-Gly-Lys-Gly-Gly, with 3-carboxy-7-diethylaminocoumarin coupled to the N-terminal glycine and (4-((4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)azo)benzoic acid) attached to the side chain of lysine [118]. To monitor MMP-12 activity, several ratiometric FRET substrates were developed based on the sequence Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Glu-Glu-Ala. The following FRET pairs were introduced, coumarin 343 (8, see Fig. 3) / TAMRA, 3-carboxy-7-diethylaminocoumarin / Oregon green and coumarin 343 / 3-carboxy-7-methoxycoumarin. The N-terminal fluorophores (excitation at 350\u2013450 nm, emission at 410\u2013490 nm) were amide-connected to proline. The C-terminal fluorophores (emission 490\u2013575 nm) were coupled to the \u03b5-amino group of a lysine moiety whose \u03b1-amino group was linked via 2-(2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy)acetic acid to the alanine of the aforementioned sequence [119]. Two quenched substrates, donor-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Lys(DNP)-Ala-Arg-NH2 with (7-amino-coumarin-4-yl)acetyl and (7-methoxy-coumarin-4-yl)acetyl as donors, showed k\ncat/K\nm values for MMP-2 of 278,800 M\u22121 s\u22121 and 179,900 M\u22121 s\u22121, respectively, and for MMP-9 of 89,200 M\u22121 s\u22121 and 82,400 M\u22121 s\u22121, respectively [120].",

Substrate cleavage led to an increasing fluorescence of the respective donor at 395 nm (proteinase-3), 445 nm (cathepsin G) and 490 nm (HNE). In two cases, coumarins were incorporated both as donors and quenchers. The proteinase-3 substrate (k\ncat/K\nM = 524,100 M\u22121 s\u22121) was assembled with lysines acylated with coumarins 11 (n = 3, X = OMe and X = OH, see Fig. 3) as donor and quencher, respectively.

A coumarin label was inserted into corresponding phosphonate inhibitors leading to probe 20 (Fig. 14\n) [123].

This principle was adapted for the design of the ABP 22 targeting human neutrophil elastase (Fig. 16\n) [127]. The coumarin tag of the probe allowed for the in-gel fluorescence detection of HNE with a low-nanomolar probe concentration.

A FRET was applied by exciting the anthranilic acid fluorophore at 320 nm and detecting the emission of coumarin 343 at 490 nm.
