Although metronidazole resistance has been documented in cases of human infection, it is not a prevalent feature in equine CDI.14 However, even targeted antimicrobial therapy can have deleterious effects on the microbiota and may disrupt or delay recolonization with beneficial bacteria. Recently, fecal transfaunation, also known as fecal microbial transplantation or fecal bacteriotherapy, has re-emerged as a treatment of CDI in humans and horses. Proximal duodenal infusion with donor feces was significantly more effective than standard vancomycin therapy in humans with recurrent CDI.18 Anecdotal evidence supports the use of fecal microbial slurries via nasogastric intubation for treatment of acute cases of equine CDI.19 Further investigation is needed to provide evidence-based support.",

It has been isolated from the gastrointestinal flora of normal horses, although reported prevalence rates are low, ranging from 0% to 8% in healthy adult horses.13 It is classified into five types (A to E) based on exotoxin production. C perfringens type A is the isolate most commonly cultured from healthy and diarrheic adult horses. \u03b22 toxin, suspected to be produced by a subtype of C perfringens type A, has been associated with clinical C perfringens infections in horses with colitis.20, 21 \u03b2-toxin produced by types B and C has direct cytotoxic effects resulting in enterocyte necrosis, mucosal ulceration, and hemorrhagic diarrhea. Enterotoxin, produced by both type A and type C strains, creates pores and alters membrane permeability, leading to cell necrosis. The pore-forming toxin NetF has also been recently identified as a major virulence determinant and has been associated with necrotizing enteritis in foals and dogs.",

This acute, potentially fatal disease is an infection with the gram-negative, obligate, intracellular, bacterial endosymbiont Neorickettsia risticii.27 The bacterium survives in digenic trematodes, such as Acanthatrium and Lecithodendrium spp.28 Trematodes use freshwater and lymnaeid snails as first intermediate hosts and aquatic insects (mayflies, caddisflies, damselflies, dragonflies, and stoneflies) as second intermediate hosts.29, 30 The definitive hosts of these trematodes are brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus and Myotis lucifugus). Horses become accidental hosts of digenic trematodes when they inadvertently ingest infected intermediate hosts. N risticii is released from the trematode and once inside the equine gastrointestinal tract it invades and replicates within the colonic epithelial cells. It also translocates into blood monocytes (equine monocytic ehrlichiosis), mast cells, and tissue macrophages. A seasonal rise in disease incidence is seen during warmer months.",

Dose-dependent binding of Di-tri-octaheadral smectite with C difficile toxins A and B, C perfringens enterotoxin, and endotoxin has been demonstrated in vitro.23, 24 The recommended dose is a 1.4-kg loading dose followed by 454 g every 6 to 12 hours, necessitating frequent nasogastric intubation. Activated charcoal is a nonspecific binding agent used in many monogastric species. A recent in vitro study demonstrated no significant effects of activated charcoal on the microbial population, major metabolites produced, rate of gas production, or pH values.58 These findings suggest that the impact of activated charcoal on the equine hindgut, and binding of toxic substances, may be minimal. Further in vivo studies are needed to elucidate the benefits of these binding agents.",
