The use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved life expectancy and transformed HIV-1 infection into a manageable chronic disease (Arts, 2012; Broder, 2010; De Clercq, 2016; Mehellou, 2010; Volberding, 2010; Zhan, 2016). Despite this, long-term side effects, latent viral infection within reservoirs and the development of drug resistance, weaken the efficacy of all clinically available drugs (Drug Resistance Data Base, 2018; Margolis, 2014; Rojas, 2014) highlighting the fact that new inhibitors and antiviral treatment strategies are constantly needed (Badia, 2017; Barre\u00e9-Sinoussi, 2013; Gulick, 2019a; Kumari, 2013; Tintori, 2014). In this sense, the initial steps in the HIV replicative cycle (entry and/or fusion with the host cells) are very attractive targets (Est\u00e9, 2011; Kang, 2013; Klase, 2012; Lu, 2016; Micewicz, 2013; Wensing, 2012).",

Interestingly, IIa retained some antiviral activity (EC50: 2.4 \u03bcM) against this mutant virus strain, although this activity was at least 19-fold lower than against the wild-type virus. In contrast, rupintrivir, a 3C protease inhibitor, retained full antiviral activity against the mutant virus strain.
