Yet, it is not guaranteed even if housing is flawlessly designed and constructed because the quality of living environment. In fact, apart from housing design and construction, residents\u2019 well-being is contingent also on housing management (Yau, 2010). While non-participation or inactivity of residents has been regarded as one of the major causes of poorly-managed housing, the impacts of neighbourhood nuisances or residents\u2019 unacceptable behaviour started gaining growing attention from policy makers, housing authorities, residents and academics in the western countries in recent years (e.g. Adderley, 2008, Burney, 2005). Frequently reported nuisances or unacceptable behaviour include deliberate littering in communal areas, using dwellings for illegal dealings, creating disturbing noise, spraying graffiti and other vandalistic acts. The seriousness of these problems has been vividly demonstrated by the increasing number of complaints and residents\u2019 dissatisfaction with their neighbourhoods (e.g. Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland, 2008, Scottish Government Social Research, 2007). These nuisances do not only lower the level of housing satisfaction (Pacione, 1982), but also adversely affect the health and well-being of the residents (Agyemang et al., 2007, Curtis et al., 2004, Jacobson et al., 2008). The neighbourhood nuisances aforementioned are, in general, socially unacceptable behaviour for their adverse impacts on other residents and the stability of society. The problems should thus be addressed.",

            "text": "In Hong Kong, neighbourhood problems did not attract much social concern before 2003, and they were dealt with in a rather fragmented manner. For example, noise nuisances were regulated by the Noise Control Ordinance whereas deliberate littering and spitting were controlled by the Fixed Penalty (Public Cleanliness Offences) Ordinance. An integrated policy to crack these problems was absent. Nonetheless, a structured control was institutionalised in 2003. As the aftermath of the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in early 2003, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong Government) implemented the Marking Scheme for Tenancy Enforcement in Public Housing Estates in August 2003, with a stated aim to improve the hygienic and living conditions in public housing estates in the territory (Team Clean, 2003). The scheme operated as a penalty-point system where sitting tenants would receive penalty points for committing the prescribed misdeeds, and would be expelled from their public housing units if their penalty points accumulated up to a certain level. Yet, the marking scheme was put onto the stage without any prior comprehensive public consultation so its legitimacy has been subject to challenges. To justify the institutionalisation of the scheme, it is necessary to understand the public housing residents\u2019 experience of neighbourhood problems, and evaluate their levels of acceptance to the scheme. Against this background, this study attempts to find out the extent and causes of neighbourhood problems in public housing perceived by the residents, who are intolerant of these problems and who support the implementation of the marking scheme in their estates through a structured questionnaire survey.",

On one hand, ASB can pose adverse impacts on the quality of the living environment. On the other hand, housing plays a significant role in the governance of ASB (Flint, 2002, Flint, 2006).

Around 25% and 10% of the households there complained against vandalism (including graffiti and damage to property) and illegal drugs, respectively, in their neighbourhoods (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2006). According to the findings from the American Housing Survey in 2009, around 25.4 million and 9.8 million occupied housing units suffered from the characteristic neighbourhood problems of noise and litter, respectively (United States Census Bureau, 2010). In England and Wales, one of the major statutory weapons against neighbourhood nuisances is the Anti-social Behaviour Order (ASBO) issued by the court. This measure was introduced under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which defines ASB as \u201cacting in a manner that caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or no more persons not of the same household as the defendant\u201d (Berman, 2009, p. 3). As reported by Berman (2009), the total number of ASBOs issued by courts at all levels increased from 104 in 1999 to 2299 in 2007. Over the period between 1 April 1999 and 31 December 2007, 14,972 ASBOs have been served. A similar situation has happened in Scotland where the number of applications for the issuance of ASBO increased by over 900%, from 26 in 1999/2000 to 283 in 2005/2006 (Scottish Government Social Research, 2007). In Northern Ireland in 2006/2007, there were 101,561 reported incidents of ASB (Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland, 2008). All these figures show that the issued ASBOs grew in number very rapidly in recent years in the United Kingdom, signifying the aggravation of the situation.",

Founded on Eysenck\u2019s (1996) personality theory of crime, Cale (2006) put forward the significant role played by personality in the ASB of an individual. On the other hand, limited opportunities available for young people and poor parenting have been considered as main structural drivers for the proliferation of ASB in contemporary society (Ipsos MORI, 2006, Jacobs and Arthurson, 2003). In Millie\u2019s (2009) opinion, social forces like the decline in moral standards and family values bring about the predicament. Other than the agency and structural factors just discussed, poor design of housing has been conceived a key contributor to the neighbourhood problems in Australia (Jacobs & Arthurson, 2003).",

Perhaps, the first principle to contain the problems is to make the residents to be self-motivated to act in a conforming manner by means of internal social controls. In most situations, however, internal social controls do not work, and various formal and informal social sanctions (i.e., external social controls) are thus necessary for ensuring behavioural conformance by the residents. In general, these external controls can be classified into three main heads, namely contractual, legal and social approaches. Examples of contractual approaches include the uses of introductory tenancies and acceptable behaviour contracts (Crawford, 2003). In the former method, for instance, the concept of probationary period in employment contract is applied. Instead of a secure or permanent tenancy, what local housing authorities offer to the new tenants is an introductory tenancy with a term of nine or twelve months in the first place. If a tenant behaves properly in the introductory or probationary period, a secure tenancy will be offered. Otherwise, the tenant will not be offered any secure tenancy or the introductory tenancy will be terminated by the social landlord before the end of the term. The application of introductory tenancies has its merits because it allows social landlords to evict \u2018trouble tenants\u2019 without the need for obtaining statutory possession orders from the courts. Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that the tenants will keep on behaving properly after the probationary period. On the other hand, legal approaches rely on punitive legislation, and involve the issuances of statutory parenting, injunction and ASB orders by courts at different levels (Flint and Nixon, 2006, Millie, 2009).",

Other interventionist means adopted in the United Kingdom include the Family Intervention Projects (FIPs) which aim to stop the ASB of families and restore safety to their homes and to the wider community. Upon referrals by statutory agencies, housing associations or voluntary sector organisations or even self-referrals, families with ASB problems have to live in FIP core accommodations and fulfil a set or rules set by the local authorities (Respect Task Force, 2006). The rules include visitors by permission only, restricted access in and out of the FIP building, and mandatory presence of the children and adults in the accommodation at a set time in the evening. The families will be sanctioned if the rules are broken. Apart from the restrictive measures, motivating approach has been adopted in Australia where tenants who meet the conditions of their tenancy agreements can enjoy rent concessions and accelerated home repairs under the Tenant Incentive Schemes (Jacobs, 2008).",

In the terminologies used by Hoffman, Mackie, and Pritchard (2010), the marking scheme imposes both temporary \u2018tenure conditionality\u2019 and \u2018access conditionality\u2019 on public housing tenants. As far as tenure conditionality is concerned, once sixteen points have been allotted to a household within a two-year period, a Notice-to-Quit (NTQ) will be served to terminate the tenancy of that household pursuant to section 19(1)(b) of the Housing Ordinance (Hong Kong Housing Authority, 2010). To strengthen the deterrent effect of the marking scheme, upon the tenancy termination under the marking scheme, the HKHA will bar the evicted households from applying for public rental housing via the general waiting list for two years, counting from the day after the date of tenancy termination. This is a form of the access conditionality on evicted tenants. To avoid the tenants taking advantage of the marking scheme to move to a better-quality flat (e.g. one with better geographical locality, young age or higher floor level), the HD will not offer a flat of better quality to those households with tenancies terminated under the scheme upon rehousing (Hong Kong Housing Authority, 2010). In other words, access of public housing tenants who carry valid penalty points to other public housing premises is also constrained. In case the ex-tenants evicted from public housing become genuinely homeless, they may be offered interim housing flats in the New Territories.",

This finding echoes with those by Millie et al. (2005) and Ipsos MORI (2006) in which poor parenting was also found to be the most imperative cause of ASB in the United Kingdom. As for poor discipline at school, the perceived relevance with Hong Kong\u2019s public housing seems being higher than the cases in the United Kingdom. These findings may be a reflection that parents from the low-income families need to work long hours so they do not have time and resources to take care of their children. Besides, the schools may not have equipped the students with good discipline. In light of these findings, the Hong Kong Government should offer more community services to support the working parents in child custody and youth development. Besides, not only should the schools discipline the students strictly, but also should the schools promote a sense of civic awareness among students.",

To this end, multivariate analyses are performed. In the structured questionnaire survey, each respondent was asked whether he or she agreed that the neighbourhood problems in his or her housing estate were very serious and intolerable. The respondent had to express his or her answer with a five-point Likert scale (with 5 = strongly agree and 1 = strongly disagree). A higher score indicates a higher level of intolerance of the respondent to the neighbourhood problems or unacceptable behaviour in his place of living. The level of support of the respondent (SUP) for the marking scheme is measured using a five-point scale (with 5 = strongly support and 1 = strongly oppose). Among the 339 respondents, 87 (25.7%) opined that the neighbourhood problems in their estates were intolerable while 101 (29.8%) thought in the reverse manner. On the other hand, only 63 respondents (18.6%) supported or strongly supported the operation of the marking scheme in their estates. Oppositions were returned from 163 (48.1%) respondents.",

Put it another way, new immigrants from mainland China and respondents from other ethnic groups did not support the marking scheme. It is possibly because these groups of people are marginal residents in the local public housing sector. In the absence of any explicit policy or regulation governing ethnic integration in neighbourhoods, these people are not well-received by the local community. Given the predominance of locally born and trained Chinese in public housing, these marginal residents can be picked on by their neighbours and edged out from their public housing units easily under the marking scheme.

The household-based enforcement of the scheme can offer a good explanation for this finding. Under the scheme, household is taken as the counting unit. The whole household has to receive the sanction even if only one of its members has committed a prescribed misdeed. It is reasonable for one to predict, if other things are constant, the chance for being sanctioned will be higher for households with more members due to the larger number of potential perpetrators. Therefore, subject to a higher chance of tenancy termination, respondents with more cohabiting family members tended were not in favour of the marking scheme. In point of fact, this kind of household-based enforcement is essentially punishment by association, or collateral punishment. It induces no-fault eviction of innocent tenants simply because of the misconducts of their household members. In addition, this penalty system can doubly victimise the innocent household members. Supposedly, the punishment by association attempts to mobilise the household members\u2019 efforts to help the perpetrators to prevent the latter\u2019s misbehaviour, and to rectify the latter\u2019s bad habits.

In western countries, foci are put on social or public housing when these problems are addressed. The rationale behind is rather straightforward: public housing is generally regarded as the marginalised housing sector because of the prevalence of the residual welfare model (Forrest and Murie, 1988, Malpass, 1990). Therefore, people living in public housing are regarded less competent in taking care of themselves, and thus more problematic. While public renting in Hong Kong is still not a heavily residualized sector, formal control against residents\u2019 unacceptable behaviour started in this sector. Since 2003, the HD implemented the marking scheme in all PRH estates and some TPS estates with a stated aim to improve the environmental hygiene in public housing. However, whether the institutionalisation of the marking scheme is justified by the seriousness of the neighbourhood problems and residents\u2019 acceptability has remain unanswered. This article contributes to the body of knowledge by exploring the views of 339 control subjects (i.e., public housing tenants) in Hong Kong towards the neighbourhood problems in their estates and the marking scheme. As indicated by the survey findings of this study, the marking scheme does not receive wide support from the public housing tenants. More importantly, it has been conceived unfair and abusive by certain groups of residents. In this regard, the HKHA may need to conduct a comprehensive review of the marking scheme, in which public housing tenants should be involved.",
