With the rapid spread across the globe, many regions were overwhelmed with patients requiring respiratory support [4, 5, 6]. Public health interventions in China provided guidance for other regions in the world on how to face a looming worldwide crisis [7]. After the first identified infection in the United States (US) in late January 2020 and subsequent evidence of community spread, state governments began drastically limiting businesses and issuing stay at home orders. Hospitals began limiting elective surgical procedures following national health guidelines in an effort to: 1) slow the spread of the disease, 2) protect patients and staff from asymptomatic or undiagnosed carriers, 3) conserve personal protective equipment (PPE), and 4) reserve inpatient capacity for the COVID-19 infections [8, 9]. With the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of a global pandemic on March 11, 2020, elective cases in the US, including hip and knee arthroplasty, began to be postponed indefinitely or canceled outright. The US Surgeon General recommended stopping elective surgery on March 14, 2020.",

Thousands of patients suffering from the daily pain of arthritis were affected and the true impact of the pandemic on these patients is unmeasured. The American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (AAHKS) sought to understand the impact these postponements have had on our patient population. The anxiety induced by the pandemic is well-documented amongst healthcare workers [12], but poorly understood amongst patients. The aim of the current study was to identify hip and knee arthroplasty patients across many different institutions in the United States that had their scheduled primary joint replacement postponed or canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic guidelines for elective surgery, and assess their pain, anxiety, physical function, and economic ability to undergo a delayed operation once the threat of COVID-19 has subsided.",

Projections of critical care shortages throughout the United States[16] and as a result, drastic public health measures designed to slow its spread[7, 9] led to a dramatic shift in the practice of hip and knee arthroplasty surgeons in the United States. The broad recommendation to postpone elective operations in the United States during the pandemic has led to a large cohort of patients with end-stage hip and knee arthritis that can no longer receive their recommended surgical treatment. By some estimations, as many as 150,000 patients will have their elective hip/knee arthroplasty postponed per month while the elective moratorium lasts[10]. In this study, we aimed to focus on these patients and their responses to the anxiety caused by COVID-19, their daily disease burden from lower extremity arthritis, and their future focus for rescheduling the planned procedure.",

Older patients at higher risk if contracting COVID were also more likely to cancel themselves compared to younger patients (18% vs. 10%). Patient anxiety was most focused on the unknown timing for future scheduling across regions. Younger patients were significantly more concerned with finances and job security. Patients from the urban Northeast region were more concerned with becoming infected by the virus. The daily symptoms of arthritis were unchanged or exacerbated in the majority of patients and limitations at home were significant for 15-20%. The drastic public health measures taken by state and federal government to slow the spread of COVID-19 were understood by the patients, but almost 90% of the respondents replied that they would like their surgery rescheduled in the near future.",

Continued work will occur over the next few months to distribute the survey more broadly and to further understand the effect the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our patients. With more patients, we hope to validate this initial study and perform more in-depth subgroup analyses. A second limitation includes the fact that survey administration was mixed between online completion and telephone review of the questions by a member of the surgeon\u2019s team. It is possible that the discrepancies in administration techniques could bias patient responses.",

From the present study, we conclude that patients clearly have anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to suffer from the effects of lower extremity arthritis while at home. Stark regional differences exist in the burden of COVID-19 in the US and this is seen in our patient\u2019s responses. Patient age also plays a large role in the reaction to the pandemic, particularly in regards to financial and job security concerns. This pilot study will be expanded to include all regions of the country and larger numbers of patients in the ensuing weeks before arthroplasty surgeons resume the performance of elective joint replacement surgery.",
