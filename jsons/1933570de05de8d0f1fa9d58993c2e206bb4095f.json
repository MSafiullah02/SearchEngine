There are many reasons, which contribute to the spread of infectious diseases, such as the open borders of the European Union, allowing rather free movement of animals over a whole continent, the globalization, the released and accelerated international and national trade and animal transfer. Simultaneously, the emergence and re-emergence of new or already known pathogens is a serious issue in veterinary and in human medicine. This scenario is clearly illustrated by the regular occurrence of transboundary animal diseases (TADs), such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), classical swine fever (CSF), African swine fever (ASF), among others. The recent occurrence of African swine fever in the Caucasus region and the spread afterwards to large territories of Russia clearly illustrates that our health authorities require a",

As an example, the LAB-ON-SITE project (coordinated by SB) strongly contributed to the development of veterinary diagnostic virology. Ten infectious TADs, listed as noti fi able to the OIE-FMD, swine vesicular disease (SVD), vesicular stomatitis (VS), CSF, ASF, bluetongue (BT), African horse sickness (AHS), Newcastle disease (ND), highly pathogenic avian in fl uenza (HPAI) and swine in fl uenza (SI)-were the subjects of this international research project of the EU. A range of new diagnostic assays were developed to to improve the current detection of the targeted ten viruses, such as novel real-time PCR assays, isothermal ampli fi cation methods, padlock probes, and novel ELISA systems. In order to improve the front-line, on-site diagnosis in the fi eld, simple methods and equipment were adapted, such as portable PCR machines, simple thermo-platforms for isothermal ampli fi cation, dipsticks and lateral fl ow devices. Many of the developed methods were compared in the large international consortium, validation was performed and standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the new methods were disseminated via international organizations, such as the OIE with its 178 member countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) with its large networks in Asia, Africa and South America. Honouring the strong output, this project was considered as one of the Success Stories in FP6 of the European Union ( http://ec.europa.eu/research/agriculture/success_labonsite_en.htm ).",

These new techniques provide powerful novel tools for the rapid detection and identi fi cation of a wide range of causative agents, as well as for supporting disease control and surveillance. For example, real-time quantitative PCR assays are highly sensitive and speci fi c methods, which are widely used for detection of various pathogens in diagnostic units, including the Reference Laboratories and the Collaborating Centres of the World Health Organization (WHO; http://www.who.int ) and of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE; www.oie.int ).",

To avoid potential degradation of the targeted nucleic acids, the samples are normally transported at low temperature using dry ice, cooling batteries and/or are stored in \u221220/70 \u00b0C freezers before further processing. Heat-and/or chemical inactivation of samples is required to avoid the transmission and spread of infectious agents. In order to diagnose the various known and \"unknown\" diseases in a safe and reliable way, proper methodologies are needed, which simplify the handling, processing of the samples, and the transport to the diagnostic laboratories. Currently, several simple tools, such as different fi lter papers or cards are commercially available for such purposes. For example, FTA\u2122 Cards, produced by Whatman plc, now a part of GE Healthcare, are suitable for the collection, transportation and storage of samples at room temperature. The company claimed that such FTA Cards contain chemicals that lyse cells, denature proteins and protect nucleic acids from nucleases, as well as from the damages caused by heat, oxidative and UV effects. At the Collaborating Centre, our colleagues have used these types of cards for transportation of samples from other countries and continents to Sweden. For example, ASF serum samples were collected in Uganda, placed on the fi lter papers, and transported to Sweden at room temperature. The same type of fi lter papers was used for transportation of Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) samples from Pakistan. Bat coronavirus samples were sent from Brazil to Sweden in an envelope, by post. Viral nucleic acids, eluted from the cards, are successfully ampli fi ed by various PCR assays or detected by other means of molecular diagnostic virology. We perform real-time PCR assays, using small pieces of cards containing samples as templates and various viruses are detected in a convincing way after this simple way of sample transportation.",

The low target content may lead to false negative results in the various PCR assays and in other molecular diagnostic procedures. In order to avoid or to reduce this very important bottleneck effect, diagnostic laboratories develop and apply a range of sample enrichment methods, in order to \" fi sh out\" the targeted pathogens or their components, such as nucleic acids or proteins, from the analyzed specimens. For example, DNA enrichment is achieved by functionalized magnetic nanoparticles that are coupled with probes to which the target DNA could be hybridized [ 3 ] .",

In addition, personnel costs and working processes have to be considered.

By using a gene-speci fi c probe, the speci fi city and analytic sensitivity of the real-time PCR may be further improved.

DIVA diagnostics is a potentially powerful tool to discriminate whether pigs are naturally infected with wild type strains or vaccinated with the lapinized live virus. The Chinese Hog Cholera Lapinized virus (HCLV) has been through extensive serial passages in rabbits in China in 1950s and is completely attenuated, but retains its ef fi cacy as vaccine. Due to its safety and ef fi cacy, this vaccine was introduced into European countries and named as \"Chinese\" strain (C-strain). \"Riems\" C-strain is one of the commercial vaccines derived from the Chinese strain. Development of a vaccine-speci fi c real-time RT-PCR would be of great value, which could be used in parallel with a wild type-speci fi c or generic real-time RT-PCR for detection and differentiation of wild type viruses from vaccine strains. Leifer et al. studied differentiation of Riems C-strain-vaccinated pigs from animals infected by CSFV fi eld strains using real-time TaqMan RT-PCR [ 14 ] . Leifer et al. also reported escape of CSF C-strain vaccine virus from detection by C-strain speci fi c real-time RT-PCR caused by a point mutation in the primer-binding site [ 15 ] . At the Collaborating Centre, we have developed a real-time PCR based on primer-probe energy transfer technology (PriProET) for the improved detection of CSFV [ 16 ] . The PriProET technology was developed initially as a novel quantitative real-time PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of all serotypes of FMDV [ 17 ] , and subsequently was used for detection of other pathogens, including SVDV [ 18 ] , and bluetongue virus (BTV) [ 19 ] . Following PCR ampli fi cation, the melting curve analysis allows con fi rmation of speci fi c amplicons, and differentiation between wild type CSFV and the HCLV vaccine strain (Fig. 36.1 ). Further evaluation of the assay demonstrated that in an RNA mixture of both wild type CSFV and C-strain vaccine, the melting curves displayed only one curve either a wild type-like or a vaccine-like depending on the dominating RNA [ 20 ] . Therefore, the PriProET melting curve analysis could identify the presence of CSFV fi eld strain in equivocal samples or in animals vaccinated with C-strain, but would not reliably detect infections with wild-type virus in a population vaccinated with the Riems strain. In a recent study, a generic real-time TaqMan RT-PCR was developed for the speci fi c detection of three lapinized vaccine strains, namely, the Taiwanese Lapinized Philippines Coronel (LPC), the Chinese HCLV, and the European Riems C-strain [ 21 ] . The new assay was able to detect the Riemser C-strain vaccine viral RNA in experimental samples, indicating that the assay could be a useful tool to facilitate outbreak control if a strategy using these lapinized vaccines is deployed.",

Recently, we have tested 33 batches of commercial Tests showed presence of both the recognized species and the newly described atypical bovine pestivirus in the FBS batch.

To overcome this limitation, three overlapping TaqMan probes were designed and used together with the above-mentioned primers for sensitive and speci fi c detection of coronaviruses of all three groups [ 27 ] . We have found this three-probe approach reduced the degree of probe degeneration and maintained a high sensitivity and speci fi city.

The results obtained from both realtime PCR assays were comparable to those from a nested gel-based PCR.

From the initial discovery of the pestivirus D32/00_'HoBi' in a batch of contaminated FBS, it was unclear how this virus is related to the two recognized bovine pestivirus species: bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1) and bovine viral diarrhoea virus 2 (BVDV-2). The answer to this question has implication in veterinary diagnostic virology as well as in the BVD control and eradication program in various countries. Phylogenetic analysis of three genetic regions showed three different relationships to both BVDV-1 and BVDV-2 [ 22 ] . To unequivocally solve the relationship, the pestivirus strain Th/04_KhonKaen was recovered from a serum sample of a naturally infected calf and the complete genome sequence was determined [ 39 ] . Phylogenetic analysis of complete genome sequences by Neighborjoining, maximum likelihood, and the Bayesian approach, unanimously placed Th/04_KhonKaen in a single lineage, distinct from the established pestivirus species, and close to BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. A further evolutionary study proposed to term these newly described bovine pestiviruses as BVDV-3 ( Fig. 36.2 ) [ 40 ] .",

            "text": "During the last decades substantial progress has been made in veterinary diagnostic virology at our laboratories at the National Veterinary Institute (SVA) and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) in Uppsala, Sweden. As the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Collaborating Centre for the Biotechnology-Based Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases in Veterinary Medicine , we have developed and tested a wide range of novel molecular diagnostic methods. Many of these novel assays provided powerful novel tools for the improved detection of viruses in veterinary and human medical virology. A wide range of the novel molecular diagnostic methods has been internationally compared in ring tests and validated. In order to illustrate this trend of development, several examples are summarized in this chapter. For molecular methods, upstream nucleic acid extraction is crucial for the success of the downstream diagnostic tests. We came to the conclusion that the real-time PCR principle, using different chemistries, such as TaqMan and PriProET, provides very reliable, highly sensitive and speci fi c novel diagnostic tools for the direct detection of a wide range of pathogens, as it is demonstrated here with several examples. Simultaneously, the real-time PCR technology allows the development of novel DIVA tests , which are highly required for the improved control of infectious diseases, using marker vaccines and accompanied diagnostic packages. In parallel, highthroughput suspension microarray technologies enable the simultaneous detection and identi fi cation of multiple pathogens in single test platforms. The liquid-phase microarray platforms, such as Luminex panels, are accelerating the detection of emerging animal viruses and zoonotic, in particular, the water-and foodborne pathogens. Proximity ligation assay has emerged as a novel method for the highly sensitive and speci fi c detection of the viral proteins. Viral metagenomics and large-scale genome sequencing establish powerful tools for the detection of \"unknown\" viruses, as well for the identi fi cation of emerging and re-emerging pathogens. These novel approaches strongly support the investigation of disease complexes and/or emerging novel disease scenarios in veterinary diagnostic virology, with regard to diseases in domestic animals and in wildlife, with special regard to zoonotic infections, by following the principles of \"One World One Health.\" ",
