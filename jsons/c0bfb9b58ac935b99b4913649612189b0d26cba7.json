In this section, we provide a short introduction of the SOM with the k-means clustering algorithm, which had the most reliable screening accuracy. The unsupervised algorithm was created by a two-layer neural network, i.e., SOM combined with a k-means clustering method. The input layer had three inputs: heart rate, respiration rate, and facial skin temperature (Fig. 6) . First, the preprocessing of the input layer for these three parameters was conducted. Data from all subjects was used to construct an ASCII file, which contained four columns, i.e., three parameters and one label. Whereas the scale of the parameters is important in determining the nature of SOM, we normalized all the parameters using the logarithmic scale. After preprocessing of the input layer, the ASCII file was used to create various SOM clusters. The SOM clustering result was visualized on a two-dimensional color-coded map using the unified distance matrix (U-matrix). The U-matrix shows the distance between neighboring map units by a color tone. This classification is composed of various clusters corresponding to a variety of U-matrix distances (color tone). Second, the k-means clustering algorithm was employed to reduce the SOM clusters into two clusters (\"Potential infection group\" and \"Normal group\"). Fig. 6 Schematic representation of SOM combined with a k-means clustering algorithm to generate a nonlinear discriminant function [20] We tested these classification algorithms on clinical data, i.e., 57 medicated influenza patients and 35 normal control subjects at the Japan Self-defense Forces Central Hospital.
