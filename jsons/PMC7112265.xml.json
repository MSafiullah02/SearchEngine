            "text": "Ubiquitination is the covalent attachment of ubiquitin, a small polypeptide of 76 amino acids, to a target protein. Ubiquitin is generally linked to the lysine residue of the target protein; however, a cysteine, serine, threonine, or N-terminal amino group of a protein can also be modified. This conjugation requires the successive activities of an E1-activating enzyme, an E2-conjugating enzyme, and then an E3 ligase. Ubiquitination is a fundamental PTM involved in many different cellular functions, including the trafficking of membrane proteins, endocytosis, signal transduction, DNA repair, and transcription regulation. Ubiquitin itself contains seven lysines, K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63. Therefore, chains of ubiquitin can be formed by attaching additional ubiquitin molecules to a lysine residue of the previously attached ubiquitin.",

A few viral DUBs have been identified, but their roles in vivo, as well as their host targets, are unknown. In contrast, several DUB-like proteins have been characterized in pathogenic bacteria. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is an invasive pathogen of the small intestine that, in mice, causes a disease similar to human typhoid fever. SseL, an effector secreted by this bacterium, displays deubiquitinating activity in vitro. It suppresses ubiquitination and degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, a central regulator of the NF-\u03baB pathway (see below) (Figure 1) (Le Negrate et al., 2008). Infection with a strain of S. Typhimurium lacking sseL leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins at the site of replicating intracellular bacteria (Rytk\u00f6nen et al., 2007). Strikingly, the decoration of intracytosolic bacteria with polyubiquitinated proteins has recently been proposed as a signal used by host cells to sense intracellular invaders (Figure 1\n). This signal triggers cytosolic defense pathways, such as autophagy, although the nature of ubiquitinated proteins is unknown (Perrin et al., 2004, Thurston et al., 2009). Bacterial DUBs may decrease this accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and thus might represent a strategy developed by intracellular bacteria to escape these specific host defense systems.",

A striking example in which PTMs by the host cell strongly alter the behavior of bacterial effectors is the Salmonella SopE and SptP proteins. These two effectors contribute to the transient remodeling of the host cell's cytoskeleton during bacterial entry into the cell. SopE acts as a GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) and activates host Rho-GTPases, resulting in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, membrane ruffling, and subsequent bacterial uptake. In contrast, SptP acts as a GAP (GTPase-activating protein) to deactivate Rho-GTPases and allow the recovery of the actin cytoskeleton's normal architecture a few hours after infection. Although SopE and SptP are codelivered by Salmonella, they exhibit different half-lives. SopE is rapidly polyubiquitinated and degraded by the host proteasome, whereas SptP exhibits much slower degradation kinetics (Kubori and Gal\u00e1n, 2003). Recent studies found that Salmonella also hijacks the ubiquitination machinery to control one of its effectors, SopB, which displays two different activities depending on whether the protein is ubiquitinated or not (Patel et al., 2009, Knodler et al., 2009). Thus, by actively co-opting the ubiquitination machinery of the host cell, Salmonella regulates the half-lives and activities of some of its key virulence factors.",

SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) belongs to the ubiquitin-like protein family and is ubiquitous in the eukaryotic kingdom. The human genome encodes three functional SUMO isoforms that can be linked to hundreds of different targets. Similar to the ubiquitin system, the conjugation of SUMO onto the lysine of a target protein requires an E1, an E2, and an E3 SUMO enzyme.

Degradation of the SUMOylation machinery is a strategy also used by Listeria monocytogenes, a food-borne bacterial pathogen responsible for listeriosis. Indeed, infection by L. monocytogenes leads to the degradation of Ubc9, the human E2 SUMO enzyme (Ribet et al., 2010). Listeriolysin O is a pore-forming toxin secreted by this bacterium, which plays a fundamental role in bacterial virulence (Figure 1). Listeriolysin O triggers the degradation of Ubc9, as well as the degradation of some SUMOylated host proteins (Ribet et al., 2010). In contrast to the ubiquitin system, which includes dozens of E2 enzymes in humans, the SUMO system has only one E2 enzyme. Therefore, this degradation of Ubc9 leads to a blockade of the SUMOylation machinery and to a global decrease in the level of SUMO-conjugated host proteins in infected cells. Thus, by decreasing SUMOylation in infected cells, Listeria may alter the activities of host factors critical for infection (Ribet et al., 2010).",

ISGylation of a small proportion of its structural protein L1 was sufficient to have a dominant-negative effect on virus infectivity (Durfee et al., 2010).

Two virulence factors produced by these extracellular bacteria, namely VopS and IbpA, are able to reach the cytoplasm of host cells during infection, where they use ATP to transfer an AMP moiety to host Rho-GTPases (Figure 2\n) (Yarbrough et al., 2009, Worby et al., 2009).

In numerous cases, factors achieve this goal by interfering with the host ubiquitination machinery. For example, S. flexneri secretes the effector OspG into the host cell's cytoplasm, where it binds to and inhibits UbcH5, a host E2 ubiquitin enzyme involved in IkB\u03b1 ubiquitination (Kim et al., 2005). The accessory protein Vpu (viral protein U) of HIV1 also interferes with IkB\u03b1 ubiquitination by inhibiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in IkB\u03b1's modification (Bour et al., 2001). The DUB-like SseL factor produced by S. Typhimurium inhibits IkB\u03b1 ubiquitination in response to the TNF-\u03b1 cytokine, suggesting that SseL acts directly by removing the K48-linked chains of IkB\u03b1 (Le Negrate et al., 2008).",

In this context, reduced neddylation levels, in particular the decrease in Cullin-1 neddylation, have been associated with a downregulation of the NF-\u03baB pathway and hypothesized to contribute to the inflammatory tolerance of the intestinal epithelium toward commensal bacteria (Kumar et al., 2009).",

Therefore, not surprisingly, pathogens often target the MAP kinase pathway in order to facilitate their infection (Figure 3). One effector protein secreted intracellularly by Shigella is OspF, which possesses phosphothreonine lyase activity. OspF irreversibly dephosphorylates host MAP kinases and, therefore, was proposed to participate in the dampening of host immune responses (Li et al., 2007, Arbibe et al., 2007). Interestingly, other bacterial virulence factors, such as SpvC from S. Typhimurium or HopAI1 from the plant pathogen P. syringae, possess the same phosphothreonine lyase activity as OspF and also target MAP kinases of their hosts (Mazurkiewicz et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2007). In addition to these factors, the Yersinia YopJ/P effector can inactivate host MAP kinases by catalyzing their acetylation (Mittal et al., 2006, Mukherjee et al., 2006). Finally, the anthrax lethal factor, a subunit of the Anthrax toxin encoded by Bacillus anthracis, cleaves host MAP kinases, leading to their irreversible inactivation (reviewed in Turk, 2007).",

For example, KSHV encodes two E3 ubiquitin ligases, K3 and K5, which both target the host protein's major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I). An essential player of the immune response, MHC I alerts the immune system to intracellular pathogens by sampling the protein repertoire of host cells and then presenting peptides to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. K3 rapidly mediates the polyubiquitination of MHC I molecules at the surface of the cell with K63-linked chains, leading to their endocytosis and degradation. Interestingly, K5 also mediates polyubiquitination of MHC I but with mixed K63 and K11 chains, instead of homotypic chains. Indeed, these mixed chains are required for the internalization of MHC I by K5, thus highlighting, for the first time, the putative importance of such mixed polyubiquitin chains in the control of immune responses (Boname et al., 2010). Some herpesvirus E3 ubiquitin ligases downregulate MHC I molecules by triggering their degradation by the ERAD (endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation) pathway (reviewed in Randow and Lehner, 2009). Some viral proteins, such as HIV Vpu accessory protein, can act as adaptors of host E3 ubiquitin ligases to induce the proteasomal degradation of other types of host immunoreceptors, such as CD4 (cluster of differentiation 4) receptor on T cells (Schubert et al., 1998). Finally, bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella, can decrease the expression of MHC class II molecules at the cell surface by modulating their ubiquitination, which also leads to the dampening of host immune responses (Lapaque et al., 2009).",
