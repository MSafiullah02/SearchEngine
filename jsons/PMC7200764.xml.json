Thus, it provides a platform for domain experts, such as clinicians, virologists, and immunologists, to collaborate with data scientists and computational biologists for a rigorous model building, accurate data interpretation and drug repositioning. It offers a shared mental map to understand gender, age, and other susceptibility features of the host, disease progression, defence mechanisms, and response to treatment.

Motivated by our curation experience and the number of participants contributing to the construction of the map, we propose and regularly revise common curation guidelines and follow commonly-accepted exchange standards. Moreover, given the multicellular and multiorgan nature of COVID-19 infection and the complexity of the underlying molecular mechanisms, we envisage the map as a hierarchical structure of interconnected functional modules.
