This hypothesis was taken up by the lay press and led to concerns among doctors and patients whether the use of these drugs was still safe and justified against the background of the pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 with an increasing number of cases and deaths. In this article, we summarize what is known about the effect of RAS blockers or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on the course of COVID-19 disease. In the case of RAS inhibition, we also find evidence for the opposite hypothesis, namely, that RAS inhibition in COVID-19 could be protective. In view of the inconsistent and limited evidence and after weighing up the benefits and risks, we would not currently recommend discontinuing or switching an effective treatment with RAS blockers. NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period. The choice of drug to treat COVID-19associated fever or pain should be based on a benefit-risk assessment for known side effects (e.g., kidney damage, gastrointestinal ulceration).",

A higher number of comorbidities, which increase with age, are correlated with poorer clinical outcomes (Guan et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020) . Epidemiological data show that the probability of dying from an infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus increases with age, from 0.2 in patients \u2264 39 years old to 8% in patients aged 70-79 years and 15% in patients \u2265 80 years old (The Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team 2020; World Health Organization 2020). Therefore, it is not surprising to find an association between the use of drugs that are more commonly prescribed in older patients and poorer outcomes of COVID-19.

This hypothesis was expressed in a commentary in Nature Reviews Cardiology ) and a letter in The British Medical Journal (Sommerstein and Gr\u00e4ni 2020) . The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a membrane-bound aminopeptidase, serves as a receptor for the coronavirus and therefore an entry portal into cells. ACE2 is also the entry receptor for SARS-CoV, which caused the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. During therapy with drugs, such as ARBs or ACE inhibitors, more ACE2 receptors are formed, theoretically producing more docking sites for the new coronavirus . Because an ACE inhibitor (lisinopril) and an ARB (losartan) are both among the 10 most commonly used drugs with a combined 152 million prescriptions per year in the USA alone (IQVIA Institute 2019), these patients would represent a substantial group of people at risk.",

Type II cells secrete surfactant and hence are critical to the gas exchange function of the lungs. Injury to these cells could explain the severe lung injury observed in COVID-19 pneumonia. ACE2 is also found in the heart, intestines, kidneys, and blood vessels and in soluble form in serum, which may explain why COVID-19, in addition to pneumonia, can cause multiple organ failure in severe cases. ACE2 as part of the renin-angiotensin system and its role in lung injury ACE2 constitutes an important alternative renin-angiotensin system (RAS) pathway that counterbalances the classical RAS pathway (Guignabert et al. 2018 ). In the classical RAS pathway, angiotensin II, which is formed from angiotensin I by ACE1, induces aldosterone secretion, salt and water retention, inflammation, and severe arteriolar vasoconstriction via binding to the AT1 receptor. In contrast, ACE2 primarily hydrolyzes angiotensin II into two other biologically active products of the RAS cascade, angiotensin-(1-9) and angiotensin-(1-7), which promote vasodilation and also reduce cell growth and inflammatory responses (Guignabert et al. 2018) .",

Notably, the injection of SARS-CoV S protein into mice worsened acute lung failure in vivo, but this effect could be attenuated by blocking the classical RAS pathway (Kuba et al. 2005 ). Imai et al. observed that ACE2 protected against severe acute lung injury in an experimental murine model of acute lung injury, whereas components of the classical RAS pathway, including ACE1, angiotensin II, and the AT1A receptor, promoted disease pathogenesis, induced lung edema, and impaired lung function.

Local inflammation involves the production of prostaglandins by inducible cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and the recruitment and activation of effector cells, such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils. This contributes to the development of pain and fever that occur during infection, which is the main reason why NSAIDs are so commonly used in infections. Alternatively, COX2 also has a pivotal role in the resolution of inflammation, thereby preventing selfinflicted damage from the immune response (Levy et al. 2001) .",

Given the dual role of COX2 in the inflammatory response, such as amplifying the initial acute phase and then promoting resolution, the question arises whether taking NSAIDs during SARS-CoV-2 infection could improve or complicate the course of the disease. The question becomes particularly important because of the two-phase immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection: the first immune defensebased protective phase and the second inflammation-driven damaging phase leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure, and subsequent fatality (Shi et al. 2020) . Due to the current novelty of COVID-19, data concerning the influence of NSAID use on COVID-19 outcomes remain needed.",

            "text": "A retrospective study of critically ill 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic patients did not show any evidence that NSAID use affects mortality (Epperly et al. 2016) . Following the SARS outbreak caused by SARS-CoV, investigators discovered that the NSAID indomethacin had direct antiviral activity against SARS-CoV via blocking viral RNA synthesis independent of COX inhibition (Amici et al. 2006) . Furthermore, antiviral activity has been confirmed in vivo in dogs infected with canine coronavirus (Amici et al. 2006) , but no human studies have been performed to confirm a positive effect for indomethacin treatment on SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infections. Notably, observational studies suggest an association between pre-hospital NSAID exposure and a protracted and complicated course of pneumonia (Voiriot et al. 2019) . A survey by the French National Agency of Medicine and Health Products Safety revealed that infections caused by varicella and some bacterial infections could be aggravated by the NSAIDs ibuprofen and ketoprofen. Based on this report, the Safety Committee of the European Medicines Agency recently initiated a review of these drugs. The mechanisms by which NSAID use may lead to a complicated course of pneumonia are uncertain. It could be assumed that the intake of NSAIDs suppresses the main symptoms of inflammation, such as fever and pain, and therefore delays the timely detection of pneumonia and the subsequent start of appropriate therapy (Voiriot et al. 2019) . Accordingly, most NSAID drug labels warn that these drugs could mask the signs or symptoms of infection. Another mechanism could be the immunological effects of NSAIDs, such as the impaired resolution of inflammation, thus resulting in prolonged disease (Voiriot et al. 2019) .",

Insufficient control of concomitant diseases caused by drug discontinuation could make patients more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and complicate the course of disease. -Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend patients who take ibuprofen for medically indicated reasons to change their anti-inflammatory medication in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible period. The choice of drug to treat fever or pain in COVID-19 should be based on a benefit-risk assessment for known side effects (e.g., kidney damage, gastrointestinal ulceration) and the respective treatment guidelines that in most cases recommend paracetamol as the first treatment option for fever or pain associated with infections.",
