The second phase, the most spectacular, is the exponential phase during which nutrients in the medium are metabolised rapidly leading to a rapid doubling of the population of bacterial cells. The population of Escherichia coli cells under optimal growth conditions can multiply each 20 min. This would mean that after 8 h the population would reach one million cells and after 43 h, the volume of cells produced would be equivalent to the volume of planet earth! Once nutrients start to deplete, the exponential growth is slowed down and the amounts of cells in the overall population remains stable; this is the third phase called the stationary phase. In this phase, secondary metabolites such as antibiotics are produced in higher quantities. The last phase is when no more nutrients are available and the amount of bacterial cells starts to drop.",

Personnel account for the majority of contaminations in the clean room environments. This can be explained by the high number of micro-organisms located on or in the human body. The organisms may be introduced into the environment due to inadequate gowning or hygiene, infrequent or ineffective hand washing and disinfection procedures, unqualified behaviour (non-clean room adequate) of personnel, etc. In the aseptic production of sterile pharmaceutical preparations living micro-organisms should not enter the aseptic filling area and the product should not contain any viable micro-organism. In those situations, low-level microbial contaminations of products occur mostly at critical interventions near to the product during processing. Microbial contamination of non-sterile pharmaceutical preparations may not originate primarily from the human body, but raw materials, equipment, air and packaging material may also play an important role\nRaw materials. Raw materials from natural origin may be highly contaminated with micro-organisms especially spore-forming bacteria and moulds and in some cases with more critical Enterobacteriaceae. Soon after a publication on salmonellosis in more than 200 persons caused by the contamination of thyroid tablets with two types of Salmonella originating from the raw material [53], proposals for the examination of non-sterile pharmaceutical preparations and acceptance criteria were published [54].\nWater. Water may be used to clean equipment and clean rooms as well as a product component. Water contains water-borne micro-organisms that may grow under low nutrient conditions. In a recent review of FDA product recalls, almost half (48 %) of them were due to contamination by water-borne micro-organisms such as Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas species, or Ralstonia pickettii [52].\nAir. Micro-organisms may be carried over from dust or soil particles and may be transported into manufacturing areas by personnel, material or airflow. Mould spores for instance were carried over from a highly contaminated source into the production room [55].\nEquipment. Equipment may be contaminated if inappropriate cleaning, disinfection or sterilisation procedures have been performed.\nPrimary packaging. The microbiological quality of primary packaging material is critical for sterile preparations. Vials, ampoules and stoppers shall be sterile and free of pyrogens before filling. For non-sterile preparations the microbiological quality of the packaging material is less critical. Because of the production process, bottles, tubes etc. will have only low levels of contamination, provided they have been packed, stored and handled under appropriate conditions.\n",

They are segregated from other operating areas and may be entered via separate air locks for personnel and material. The incoming air of the clean rooms is filtered using HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filters that may retain more than 99.995 % of 0.3 \u03bcm air particles (see Table 10.1007/978-3-319-15814-3_27#Tab4). The higher the microbiological quality of the product or the critical the process step, the higher the clean room quality criteria. For instance in aseptic processing of sterile products for critical areas where the product is exposed to the surrounding environment, the air should not contain more than 3,520 particles of 0.5 \u03bcm size per cubic metre and should be devoid of viable micro-organisms (see air classifications in Tables 10.1007/978-3-319-15814-3_27#Tab2 and 10.1007/978-3-319-15814-3_27#Tab3). Clean room design should ensure that air, personnel and material flow is optimal to prevent microbial contamination from a less clean area to a cleaner area. Isolators have been introduced as an alternative to conventional clean rooms for aseptic production. These may be large installations, in which complex operations such as large-scale aseptic filling of syringes can be performed.Controlled environments also regard to aseptic handling in pharmacies, where they are achieved using laminar flow cabinets, biological safety cabinets or isolators (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-15814-3_28#Sec34).Cleaning and disinfection. The procedures for cleaning and disinfection (destruction of micro-organisms \u2013 but not necessarily spores \u2013 by chemical agents, see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-15814-3_31#Sec13) of equipment parts that are in contact with the product have to be validated. In addition, for the more critical products that are required to be sterile, the equipment parts that are in contact with the product need to be sterilised. Sterilisation (destruction of micro-organisms including spores by heat) process of the manufacturing lines has also to be validated. For products, which are required to be sterile, the aseptic status of the production line is regularly evaluated by performing media fill simulations that consist of replacing the product with a microbial culture medium and evaluating if filled-media containers remain sterile.Reducing bioburden. The preparation processes may reduce or even eliminate living micro-organisms. For instance on the preparation of tablets, the tableting of a granulate into a tablet may kill non-spore forming micro-organisms by the shearing forces of the interparticulate movement. Products required to be sterile are either sterile filtered (filter \u22640.2 \u03bcm pore diameter, see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-15814-3_30#Sec22) or terminally sterilised directly in their container or package (e.g. steam sterilisation (Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-15814-3_30#Sec6), radiation (Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-15814-3_30#Sec15), ethylene oxide gas (10.1007/978-3-319-15814-3_30#Sec17)).Water distribution system. The distribution and storage systems for water that is used for cleaning, sterilisation and preparation should be devoid of biofilms. A distribution system may be controlled by continuously circulating heated water (>80 \u00b0C) in loops, avoiding one-way systems and dead ends, and application of disinfection steps such as adding ozone to the re-circulating water (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-15814-3_27#Sec22). The latter processes are often called sanitisation. In addition to the physico-chemical characteristics, water is monitored for microbiological counts. For preparation on a smaller scale, the storage of water should follow strict requirements as well, see further Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-15814-3_23#Sec21.Standing time. Other risk mitigating actions may include defining maximum standing times for intermediate or final aqueous solutions if microbial growth is to be expected, performing internal audits to ensure that procedures are followed, and testing the product\u2019s container closure integrity.\n",

A major health issue related to microbiologically contaminated pharmaceutical preparations was the 2012 New England Compounding Center (NECC) meningitis outbreak in the USA [56]. On October 4, 2012, the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control) and the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) issued a recall alert for pharmaceutical preparations produced by the NECC, following a multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections among patients who received contaminated preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate epidural injections. Most patients suffered infection by the fungus Exserohilum rostratum and in August 2013, CDC reported 749 cases and 63 deaths. After performing microbiological testing of the unopened incriminated product lots, CDC confirmed presence of Exserohilum rostratum, along with other fungi (e.g. Cladosporium cladosporioide, Aspergillus fumigatus) and spore-forming bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis) [57]. After inspecting the NECC preparation area, the FDA mentions in its report [58] that moulds and bacteria were found in large numbers in many air and surface samples where the products were prepared.",

The sample is mixed with a special reagent, which causes lysis of the cells, liberating the ATP, followed by addition of the luciferin and luciferase reagents. The amount of emitted light is measured by means of a photomultiplier system and used as an indicator of the number of cells present. This principle can be applied for numerous purposes, such as the detection of micro-organisms in products or monitoring of cleaning and disinfection procedures. Its use has been suggested for microbiological examination of sterile and non-sterile pharmaceutical preparations [72, 73].",

The method is able to detect a single cell within about 2 h post sample processing and testing. It is used to monitor large water systems in pharmaceutical plants [74].",
