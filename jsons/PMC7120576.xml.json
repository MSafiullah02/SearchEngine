It is easier to dissect the various immunoregulatory mechanisms involved in viral infections using LCMV due to the availability of two different strains; one that establishes acute infection (LCMV-Armstrong) and is readily cleared from the host and the other that establishes persistent infection (LCMV-clone 13) for a very long time. Armstrong and clone 13 viruses share identical CD4 and CD8 T-cell epitopes but are phenotypically very distinct, replicate in different cell types, and have different clearance rates [21]. Further, since LCMV is not a cytolytic virus, it allows to distinctly examine the effects caused by the immune response-mediated damage to the host tissue [22].",

            "text": "Persistent viral infections ultimately result in immunosuppression in the host where the CTLs lose functionality by either functional inactivation and/or physical deletion [1]. Several different mechanisms, which act either individually or in combination, including clonal exhaustion, secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, and overexpression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) on activated T-cells, contribute to the failure of T-cell responses during persistent viral infections. In LCMV-clone 13 model of persistent infection, multiple immunoregulatory mechanisms are activated, including infection/impairment of DCs, and a global inactivation of the virus-specific T-cell response [23\u201327]. The antiviral CD4 and CD8 T-cells are either physically deleted or persist in an inactivated state and are nonresponsive toward viral antigens [23\u201327]. With respect to the significance of such inactivation in human patients, in HIV infection, CD4 T cells that can produce TNF-\u03b1, interleukin 2 (IL-2), and IFN-\u03b3 are conspicuously absent. Consequently, in HIV+ patients, the presence of functionally active CD4 T-cells that can produce the cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IL-2 directly correlates with low viremia [28]. Similarly, in mouse models of persistent infection, a significant three- and fourfold decrease in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-2 producing cells, respectively, was observed in the spleens of clone 13 infected mice by day 100 postinfection [23].",

Thus, it was interesting to note that despite prolonged periods of inactivation, the remaining CD4 and CD8 T-cells still retain the ability to recover their functional activity [29]. This suggests that, in persistent viral infections, the host\u2019s immune system can still be manipulated such that the host can reestablish immunity against the virus. Thus, functional preservation of CD4 and CD8 T-cells during viral persistence is the ultimate mode of achieving strong antiviral immunity and viral clearance.",

On the other hand, the goal of the immune system is to clear the virus, failing which the immune responses need to be downregulated so as to avoid unnecessary damage to the host tissue, by a process known as immunoregulation. The various known immunoregulatory mechanisms comprise (a) activation or induction of Tregs, (b) expression of inhibitory molecules such as programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) on activated T-cells, and (c) production of suppressor cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2 or IL-10. In the recent past, among the major immunoregulatory molecules identified so far [15, 30\u201332], IL-10 [15, 32] and PD-1 [30] appear to be playing a significant role in the regulation of antiviral immune responses and are thus being actively investigated. The confounding aspect of all these different factors is that they not only regulate antiviral immune responses but they are also involved in the regulation of autoimmune responses.",

In addition, Dillon et al. showed that stimulation of macrophages through the TLR2 receptor induces macrophages that promote immunological tolerance through the production of TGF-\u03b21 [41].

Therefore, the initiation of effective Ag-specific immunity to pathogens is a hallmark of DC function. However, it was also demonstrated that DCs can induce and maintain self-antigen-specific tolerance in the periphery [45]. Further, DCs can actively induce T-cell anergy [46, 47], T-cell suppression [47, 48], and generation of Tregs [49]. As they did for macrophages, Dillon et al. also showed that stimulation through the TLR2 receptor on DCs induces regulatory DC [41]. Further, TLR2 activation in mice results in IL-10 upregulation and Treg survival [50, 51]. Interestingly, incubation of DCs in the presence of IL-10 generates DC with tolerogenic properties [52]. Thus, DCs, when activated through the TLR2 receptor, appear to acquire regulatory phenotype and indeed are able to suppress the activation antigen-specific T-cells.",

However, it appears that direct cell-contact-mediated suppression is critical for the action of Tregs. Tregs inhibit, via CTLA-4, the upregulation of CD80 and CD86 by immature DC upon antigenic stimulation and also downregulate the expression of CD80/CD86 by mature DC [79, 80], thus indirectly affecting antiviral CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses. Another plausible mechanism by which Tregs mediate their regulatory activity has been proposed; since Tregs cannot produce IL-2 and thus cannot expand in an autocrine fashion [81], but constitutively express high levels of IL-2R (CD25), they likely deprive effector T-cells of IL-2 in the vicinity and thus provide hindrance to the activation/expansion of responder T cells [82].",

TGF-\u03b2 also exhibits highly potent inhibitory effects on cytolytic functions, cytokine production, and proliferation of T-cells (reviewed in [98]). Conversely, TGF-\u03b2 also exhibits antiapoptotic effects [99\u2013101] on T-cells best exemplified in the case of the effector T-cells. When cultured in the presence of TGF-\u03b2 and IL-2 effector, CD4 T-cells exhibit enhanced accumulation (owing to increased proliferation and survival) and even better prolonged expansion [99]. And finally, TGF-\u03b2, produced by Tregs, can act in an autocrine fashion to induce further expansion of Tregs from which it is produced. Also, TGF-\u03b2 can induce the conversion of na\u00efve CD4+CD25\u2212 T cells into CD4+CD25+ T cells by the induction of Foxp3 [102]. Thus TGF-\u03b2 is extensively used to induce the expansion of Treg in in vitro cultures. Data from our laboratory as well as others have now shown that such in vitro expanded Tregs are able to adoptively confer protection in virus-induced T1D model (reviewed in [103]).",

Although, TGF-\u03b2 cannot induce the conversion of na\u00efve cells to Th17 by itself, together with IL-6, TGF-\u03b2 facilitates the differentiation of T-cells into Th17 cells [107]. The most important aspect of TGF-\u03b2-induced effect is that TGF-\u03b2 in conjunction with IL-2 induces the differentiation of na\u00efve T-cells into Foxp3+ Tregs and this IL-2 inhibits the differentiation into Th17 cells [108].",

Hence, TGF-\u03b2 apparently is very important in the regulation of antiviral immunity because while Tregs (as discussed above) are clearly involved in preventing tissue damage due to immune pathology, Th17 cells are highly proinflammatory and are known to be playing a significant role in autoimmune diseases.

It is known that by 9 days after infection with LCMV clone 13, which establishes persistent infection in adult mice, both virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells become unresponsive. Data from our laboratory showed that the use of an antibody to the IL10 receptor results in very efficient control of viral persistence, even leading to the elimination of virus. By removing IL-10 inhibitory effect, in this case on T-cell anergy, we were able to induce host resistance such that the host could now resolve persistent LCMV infection [15]. This was followed by further proof that such IL-10 acts on effector T-cells [32]. When IL-10 was blocked with antibody to IL-10 receptors, T-cell numbers increase sufficiently to clear virus from blood and tissues; these T-cells that were anergized because of the persistent virus infection now regained their ability to produced proinflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and thus were able to reacquire their normal effector T-cell functions [32].",

Accordingly, significantly more IL-10 RNA was found in the spleens of clone 13-infected mice than that of Armstrong-infected mice [32]. CD4+CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells are thought to be the major producers of IL-10. However, in clone 13 persistent infection, although CD4 T-cells produced some IL-10 initially, they are not responsible for the majority of IL-10, since IL-10 was produced in significant quantities even after the functional inactivation of CD4 T-cells; further these CD4 T-cells stopped making any IL-10 after functional inactivation [32]. Interestingly, instead of the CD4 T-cells, it appears that DCs are the major producers of IL-10 in clone 13 infection [32]. Further, using IL-10\u2212/\u2212 mice, the authors found that the lack of IL-10 resulted in the preservation of viral antigen (NP396-404)-specific CD8 T-cell responses that are normally lost during persistent infection [32]. And, as we had reported originally [15], antibody blockade of IL-10 prevented viral persistence [32], thus definitely showing that IL-10 plays a major role in immunoregulation during persistent viral infection with LCMV.",

The major role players responsible for the immunosuppression that happens during persistent infections have been identified as PD-1/PD-L1 and IL-10, with TGF-\u03b2 and CTLA-4 also playing a role to some extent (Fig. 1). The recent observation that the functionally inactive T-cells during chronic viral infections can be made to regain their cytokine secretion and cytolytic abilities by neutralizing IL-10 is very encouraging [32]. More importantly, when IL-10 [111] or PD-L1 [84] was first neutralized, therapeutic vaccination against ongoing persistent LCMV infection was highly effective. Further, IL-10R blockade resulted in the ability of an otherwise ineffective DNA vaccination to be successful such that the DNA vaccination elicited a fourfold increase in the number of functional CD8 T cells [111]. Thus, it would be likely that neutralization of either IL-10 or PD-1/PD-L1 (depending on the virus) during the persistent viral infection would result in the preservation of effector T-cell responses against the virus thereby resulting in the elimination of the persistent infection.\n",

In an acute infection (left), when a virus infects a normal cell, it is phagocytosed by antigen presenting cell (APC) (dendritic cell [DC] or M\u03a6). The APCs efficiently present the viral antigens to CD4 and CD8 cells, which either release proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3) or upregulate perforin, which kills the infected cells, ultimately leading to the elimination of the virus. However, in persistent infection (right), due to a number of reasons, including miRNAs and molecular mimicry, viruses evade immune recognition. Thus, the CD4 and CD8 cells are not sufficiently activated and the virus avoids immune-mediated elimination. On the other hand, APCs (M\u03a6 and DCs), upon TLR2 activation, upregulate IL-10; IL-10 exhibits significant immunosuppressive effects leading to the inactivation of CD4 and CD8 T-cells. Further, activated T-cells also upregulate CTLA-4 that prevents costimulation, thereby leading to inactivation. And, finally, virus antigen-specific T-cells also upregulate PD-1 which, upon engagement with its ligand PD-L1, signals the death of that T-cell. These events, help to avoid immune response mediated host tissue damage but at the cost of establishing viral persistence.",
