Chronic carriers of typhoid bacteria (Salmonella typhi) were isolated alone at home or at the counties epidemic house by themselves (Smitteborg, \"infection castle\" in Skreia, Norway, is still a local name). The epidemic houses had access control and were monitored by the healthcare board mayor. Hygiene and infection control were very important since they had few curative agents. It was prepared vaccines and carried out partly or complete mass vaccinations against some infections.",

During outbreaks of typhoid fever, diphtheria or scarlet fever, the patients were isolated in separate sick barracks or at home. To be a carrier of an infectious disease could lead to work prohibition and isolation. Schools were closed intermittently during outbreaks, and posters were put on houses with infectious disease as a warning. Disinfection of houses, clothing and all of its contents was completed after the termination of the isolation period, using chlorine and sulphur smoke. Carbolic acid and hydrochloric acid were also used where sulphur fumes treatment failed. Bedding, clothing and fixtures that could not be washed or disinfected were often burned, with a financial compensation for this \"outlay.\" Patients who broke the isolation routines could be penalized and committed to further isolation. The society's need went first before each individual's needs [46] .",

Pressure is usually, \u221216 to \u221225 pascal relative to the corridor and the adjacent rooms. In the sluice there is 6-10 pascal, in the patient room \u221216 to \u221225 pascal and disinfection room \u221225 pascal.

Among 470 persons who entered isolates, the compliance was higher by strict isolation infections (65%) than with other infectious conditions [83] . Visitors followed the measures better than personnel (88% versus 41%) [83] . The compliance with isolation procedures increased significantly when more time was spent with the patient, being a visitor, and when the patient was on a strict isolation [83] . The study pointed out the danger of increased demands for doctors and nurses due to savings can result in adverse effects such as reduced compliance with key routines as isolation [83] . Morgan et al. observed 7750 visits of a healthcare professional to isolated and non-isolated patients. Patients on contact isolation had 36% fewer visits and 18% less contact, and there were fewer visitors than non-isolated patients [84] . However, the staff implemented significantly more frequent handwashing after visit in isolates, 63%, than by visits with non-isolated patients, 47% [84] . \u2022 During the MRSA outbreak with ca 150 patients in Trondheim, Norway, 1970-1974, Kvittingen et al. described problems that may occur during epidemic and endemic conditions as \"doctors more or less wholehearted support and scepticism to the measures made by the Hygiene Committee, discussions concerning the virulence and resistance development, what to do when a local outbreak paralyzes the department completely, information problems, lack of qualified personnel, etc.\" [68, 85] . They stressed that \"larger hospitals should dispose well-planned isolation opportunities, both for patients who are infectious spreaders and perhaps equally important, to protect patients with reduced infection defence,\" and that \"personnel in management positions (should) provide effective and loyal support for infection control personnel\" [68] . \u2022 This was a very important observation done for more than 40 years ago. It is still causing major problems during outbreaks and endemic situations when there may be a choice between shortcut thoughts about \"economy\" and infection control. Still, impression and experience is that staff working directly with the patients have great respect for contact and airborne routines, at least in Norway.",

Although isolation of patients with infectious diseases has been used for hundreds of years, there is little evidence in terms of endemic conditions [19] [20] [21] [22] . The Norwegian isolation regimes are based mostly on guidelines from CDC [9] [10] [11] [12] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . In addition, an increasing number of guidelines are focusing on special isolation factors [19, 64-66, 69-73, 86 ]. CDC's isolation guideline is graded from high evidence, highly recommended as the IA, to no recommendation and unresolved questions or professional disagreement [19] . Category IC is included in the legislation for patients and caregivers [19] . Classification into categories is essential for the most important infection control measures in hospitals. \"These recommendations are designed to prevent transmission of infectious agents among patients and healthcare personnel in all settings where healthcare is delivered. As in other CDC/HICPAC guidelines, each recommendation is categorized on the basis of existing scientific data, theoretical rationale, applicability and, when possible, economic impact\" [19] .

One year later, all patients were VRE negative [23] . A number of outbreaks at Ullev\u00e5l's premature intensive care unit during years have been linked to chronic understaffing, overcrowding, part-time work, lack of infection control practices and isolates, lack of information and a lack of management responsibilities [24, 37] .",

Construction activity of all types without measures against airborne infection is influencing the airborne spread of bacteria, virus and fungi. This must be taken into account when rebuilding and repairing buildings and ventilation ducts etc. [22, 105] . If ignored, it may cause large problems like the outbreak of Bacillus cereus among 171 patients, most with sepsis, during 6 months of a large construction project next to the hospital [105] . Air samples showed growth of large quantities of Bacillus inside the hospital, the units and also isolates, and hospital textiles were heavily contaminated [105] .",

MRSA may even be spread to nearby located rooms, to patients not infected [113, 114] . The few existing units for airborne infection isolation mean that most patients, except for pulmonary tuberculosis, most often are admitted to contact isolation or single-patient rooms, with the use of PPE corresponding to airborne infection: gloves, infection-protecting gown, cap and surgical mask and sometimes room-bound shoes [22] .",

During the Ebola outbreak in 2014, healthcare workers were again severely attacked by the disease and death in the first phase, until a more protective personal protective equipment system was in place [34, [120] [121] [122] . There is still a great variety in international guidelines in terms of personal protection equipment (PPE) by Ebola virus for healthcare workers [121] . The WHO, United Kingdom and CDC defined Ebola as non-airborne infection in 2014 and still does the same in 2017 [121] . None of these recommended respiratory protection for suspected Ebola infection in August-September 2014, at least half a year after the start of the epidemic. Only the United Kingdom recommended respirator mask for confirmed Ebola. There was no covering of the head or neck, not either during aerosol-generating procedures! In October 2014, the CDC upgraded the PPE measures to strict isolation measures for proven Ebola infection, while the earlier PPE measures were recommended for suspected Ebola infection (Table 21 .1) [120] [121] [122] . During the pandemic flu in 2009, Norwegian health authorities did not allow the staff at hospitals to use respirator masks (P3 masks) when taking care of the flu patients; they should use surgical masks [138] . Exceptions were for aerosol-generating procedures. The same health authorities went public and said that surgical masks did not have any protective effect! [138] Recurrent problems are that the health authorities are not able to see the importance in protecting health professionals who are-and will always be-the frontline workers, even at the most serious infectious diseases [137] . Governments that are not willing to take care of their healthcare employees create unnecessary fear and reluctance to make a good contribution during outbreaks. If the disease is not as dangerous as SARS and Ebola, a highly contagious pandemic influenza or a large norovirus outbreak could paralyse the healthcare system when a high number of the staff get sick at the same time. By preventing disease transmission to health professionals, the hospital can be operatively enough to handle properly other serious diseases such as traffic accidents, myocardial infarction, stroke, etc., even at largescale epidemics.",
