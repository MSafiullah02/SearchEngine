They are responsible for respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurologic disease in mammals and birds (Wege et al., 1982). Within the Coronaviridae subfamily Coronavirinae, there are four genera defined on the basis of serological cross-reactivity and genetic homology: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus (Woo et al., 2012). ECoV is classified within the Betacoronavirus 1 genus, along with human coronaviruses OC43, 4408 and HKU1, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, canine respiratory coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, bubaline coronavirus and sialodacryoadenitis rat coronavirus (Zhang et al., 2007). Coronaviruses have helical capsids made up of the nucleocapsid protein complexed with the genomic RNA. In the envelope, the spike protein trimerises to form peplomers, giving the virion its corona or crown-like morphology. ECoV also has smaller spikes on the membrane made from the hemagglutinin esterase protein. In addition, two structural proteins, designated the membrane and small membrane proteins, of the virion are fully trans-membranous (Weiss and Leibowitz, 2011). Full genome sequences are available for four ECoV isolates, one from the USA and three from Japan (Zhang et al., 2007, Nemoto et al., 2015a). The three recent isolates from Japan were closely related to the isolate from North Carolina (NC99), with sequence homology ranging from 98.2 to 98.7% (Nemoto et al., 2015a).",

The increase in overall number is driven by increased awareness and testing. The number of ECoV qPCR-positive cases is higher during the colder months of the year (October to April), similar to the seasonal disease pattern seen with BCoV. Samples from horses testing positive for ECoV by qPCR have come from all states of the USA except Hawaii and Alaska (Fig. 1\n).",

As an example, in 2014, the age distribution of confirmed ECoV infections was 20.5% in foals (age 0\u20136 months), 25.3% in horses aged 6 months to 5 years and 54.2% in horses older than 5 years. Foals from Central Kentucky with clinical gastrointestinal disease were found to be only positive for ECoV if other co-infections were present (e.g. rotavirus or Clostridium perfringens) with the detection frequency of ECoV by qPCR being similar between healthy and clinically affected foals (Slovis et al., 2014). This is in sharp contrast to a similar study performed in Japan (Nemoto et al., 2015b), showing that ECoV was not detected in rectal swabs from 307 diarrheic foals in the Hidaka district of Hokkaido. Adult horses with clinical signs experience a mono-infection with ECoV (Pusterla et al., 2013). The closely-related BCoV also causes enteric disease in adult cows and mild respiratory disease in calves (Saif et al., 1986, Tsunemitsu et al., 1999, Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 2001, O\u2019Neill et al., 2014). ECoV outbreaks in adult horses have been reported in riding, racing and show horses, and less frequently in breeding animals. It is speculated that given the lack of large numbers of documented clinical cases at larger breeding farms, one hypothesis is that ECoV circulates between young and adult horses, conferring protection against clinical disease in adult horses.",

The Midwest region displayed the highest odds ratio (OR) of seropositivity in horses (OR = 1.80). Furthermore, draft horses showed the highest odds ratio of seroprevalence of the breeds tested (OR = 1.95), while Thoroughbreds had the lowest odds ratio of seroprevalence (OR = 0.48). Ranch/farm and breeding horses displayed the highest odds ratio of seroprevalence (OR = 1.30, OR = 1.60). The authors of this study speculated that factors contributing to the higher ECoV seroprevalence in the Midwest could be related to the higher numbers of ECoV seropositive draft horses used for farm/ranch work and breeding in that region. While the determined risk factors highlighted by Kooijman et al. (2017) are very specific to the studied horse population, it is interesting to notice that draft horses have a higher infection rate compared to other breeds. This parallels with the first ECoV cases reported from Japan in racing draft horses (Oue et al., 2011, Oue et al., 2013).",

The incubation period for ECoV is short and clinical disease develops between 48 to 72 h after either natural exposure or experimental infection (Nemoto et al., 2014, Fielding et al., 2015). Clinical signs are present for a few days to 1 week and generally resolve with minimal supportive care.",

Human coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV, have been shown to persist up to 2 days in waste water and dechlorinated tap water, 3 days in feces and 17 days in urine at room temperature (Wang et al., 2005). Survival may be longer at lower temperatures; the virus persists for up to 14 days in waste water and at least 17 days in feces or urine at 4 \u00b0C (Wang et al., 2005). Greater survival and viability of ECoV and BCoV in colder weather is one possible explanation for the apparent higher prevalence of virus-positive fecal samples and clinical disease during cooler weather.",

Pusterla, unpublished data). The most frequent clinical signs reported were anorexia (97%), lethargy (88%) and fever (83%).

Systemic signs (anorexia and fever) preceded gastrointestinal signs. Lethargy, anorexia and pyrexia were also the main clinical signs in recent outbreaks in adult draft horses from Japan, while specific gastrointestinal signs were observed in about 10% of affected horses (Oue et al., 2011, Oue et al., 2013). Signs of encephalopathy, including circling, head pressing, ataxia, proprioceptive deficits, nystagmus, recumbency and seizures, have been reported in 3% of clinically infected horses (Pusterla et al., 2013, Fielding et al., 2015). Fielding et al. (2015) reported a case that had severe hyperammonemia (677 \u03bcmol/L; reference \u2264 60 \u03bcmol/L) and died after exhibiting encephalopathic signs. Hyperammonemia associated with ECoV infection may be caused by increased ammonia production within or absorption from the gastrointestinal tract as a consequence of gastrointestinal barrier breakdown. Enteric ammonia production could increase as a result of bacterial microbiome changes associated with ECoV infection.",

One factor affecting viral load is the ability of individuals to express genes involved in inflammation and innate immunity (Chen et al., 2006). Variations in viral load can also be influenced by the coronavirus strain. The replication capability of feline coronavirus (FCoV) provides good evidence of its effect on virulence (Chang et al., 2012). The benign feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) genotype has low replication competency in enterocytes, but FCoV also has a highly virulent feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) virus (FIPV) genotype with an enhanced ability to replicate in different cell populations. A single point mutation on the spike gene of the different FCoV genotypes has been linked to the changes in cell tropism, replication potential and clinical manifestations (Chang et al., 2012).",

Surprisingly, in the Hidaka district of Hokkaido, all 337 rectal swabs from foals with diarrhea were negative for ECoV by qPCR, while 3/120 (2.5%) fecal swabs from healthy foals were positive for ECoV. This study is in contrast to a study performed in Central Kentucky, where ECoV was detected at a similar frequency in feces of both healthy and diarrheic foals (Slovis et al., 2014). The difference between healthy and clinically-affected animals was that, from the panel of infectious agents tested, healthy foals usually (except for one) only showed infection with ECoV, whilst ECoV positivity in foals with gastrointestinal disease was associated with co-infections (Slovis et al., 2014). An ECoV infection in a foal may predispose the animal to a secondary infection with other enteric pathogens, as shown for other coronaviruses (Pakpinyo et al., 2003, Srikumaran et al., 2007, Brockmeier et al., 2008).",

This suggests that the infected animal\u2019s age influences the pathogenicity of ECoV, perhaps due to differences in immunological responses between foals and adult horses, or the presence of protective maternally-derived antibodies in foals. Age-related patterns of disease have been reported for FCoV, where most FIP cases occur in cats younger than 2 years of age and protracted dry cases tend to occur in older cats. The clinical outcome of the infection is affected by the development of humoral, cell-mediated or mixed immune responses against the highly virulent FIPV genotype of FCoV. Interestingly, severe suppression of natural killer cells and T regulatory cells is correlated with clinical outcome, confirming reports that fatal FIPV infection is associated with a weakened cell-mediated immune response (Vermeulen et al., 2013).",

NSAIDS are known to have adverse effects on the equine intestine and this should be taken into consideration before these drugs are used. Horses with more severe signs, such as diarrhea and/or colic, should be treated more intensively with parenteral or enteral fluids and electrolytes. In horses developing signs of endotoxemia and/or septicemia secondary to disruption of the gastrointestinal barrier, antimicrobial agents and gastrointestinal protectants should be considered. While hyperammonemia-associated encephalopathy only occurs in a small percentage of horses with ECoV infection, early recognition and treatment with oral lactulose or neomycin sulfate is associated with a positive outcome (N.
