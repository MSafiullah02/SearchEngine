This time is essential, because it allows countries to prepare their response. This study considered a gravity model that expressed time to first case as a function of multiple socio-economic factors. First, Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for each variable in the model by dividing countries into two groups according to the median of the respective variable. In order to measure the effect of these variables, parameters of the gravity model were estimated using accelerated failure time (AFT) survival analysis. In the Kaplan-Meier analysis the differences between high and low value groups were significant for every variable except population. The AFT analysis determined that increased personal freedom had the largest effect on lowering the survival time, controlling for detection capacity. Higher GDP per capita and a larger population also reduced survival time, while a greater distance from the outbreak source increased it. Understanding the influence of factors affecting time to index case can help us understand disease spread in the early stages of a pandemic.",

This means shorter periods of time until the neighboring communities experience their first case. In addition to population size and distance, economic and political factors can also influence spread. Thus, I propose the following model: Where is the number of days until the index case in country i, is the distance from country i to the country where the disease originated (China), is a measure of human and economic freedom in country i, is the population, is the GDP per capita, is the degree of urbanization, is the volume of air travel, and is the epidemiological detection capacity. 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6, 7 are the model parameters.

Past work on the topic also did not include potential confounders such as personal freedom, air travel volume and urbanization. Opportunities to conduct an ecological study of this type are as rare as major pandemics.

Potential confounding could be caused by the tendency of countries with lower personal freedom to underreport and underdiagnose (Kavanagh, 2020) . However, the Global Health Security Detection and Reporting score mitigates at least some of the confounding, as it accounts for the capacity and willingness of countries to report. This could have implications in the policy of the early stages of a pandemic. Most countries have opted for social distancing measures which reduce personal freedom, like limiting public gatherings and travel restrictions (Lewnard & Lo, 2020) . Consensus on the effectiveness of these measures has not been reached.",

Implementing restrictions as soon as a potentially pandemic virus starts spreading could delay its arrival to a country. If countries had more time to prepare their response, there would be a lower probability of straining health systems and thus fewer deaths. This type of analysis could be used to guide risk assessment and identify countries that are likely to be affected sooner in the course of a pandemic. These high-risk countries that have less time to spare would benefit from even more attention to pandemic preparedness. The results merit further investigation into the application of the model at the district and regional level, to assess whether it can be used at a smaller scale.",
