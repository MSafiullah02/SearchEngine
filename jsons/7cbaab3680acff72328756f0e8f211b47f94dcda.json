This leads to an increase of angiotensin II activity, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), and pulmonary, cardiac, or systemic dysfunction. 2, 3 Cardiac surgical patients usually have multiple comorbidities, and invasive monitoring is commonly required. This creates great challenges for the perioperative cardiac surgical team, while managing suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during cardiac surgery.

Rapid sequence induction and endotracheal intubation are recommended. Fast-acting muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine or rocuronium are preferred. Low-pressure mask ventilation with 100% oxygen can be given to patients with poor oxygen reservoir. 4. With personal protective equipment in place, anesthesiologists cannot perform auscultation to confirm placement of the endotracheal tube (ETT). Tube position should be verified by detection of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO 2 ) waveform, symmetrical chest rises, pulse oximetry, and depth of the ETT. 9 5.
