            "text": "Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology, most commonly involving the lung, skin, lymph node, and eyes.1 Granulomatous inflammation can be initiated by infectious agents, such as fungi or Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), or by noninfectious agents, such as beryllium (chronic beryllium disease). Analysis of sarcoidosis epidemiology suggests that infectious agents have a role in sarcoidosis pathogenesis. Investigators in A Case Control Etiologic Study of Sarcoidosis observed positive associations between sarcoidosis risk and certain occupations, such as agricultural employment, exposure to insecticides, and moldy environments.2 Another study noted that the hospitalization admissions for African Americans with sarcoidosis in South Carolina increased with proximity to the Atlantic Ocean.3 A unifying factor in environmental and geographic reports is the possibility of exposure to microbial bioaerosols. Natural waters; water distribution systems; biofilm in pipes; peat and potting soil; water droplets; equipment, such as bronchoscopes and catheters; and moldy buildings are natural habitats for environmental opportunistic mycobacteria.4 Aerosolization of environmental opportunistic mycobacteria has been associated with the development of other granulomatous diseases of mycobacterial origin, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis.5\n",

            "text": "A growing scientific interest involves defining the microbial community within distinct diseases, that is, microbiome analysis. Microbiome analysis was performed on the upper and lower airway of subjects with interstitial lung diseases, including idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP), non-IIP, and sarcoidosis as well as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and healthy controls. The microbiota in lower airways of a majority of patients (30; 90%) primarily consisted of Prevotellaceae, Streptococcaceae, and Acidaminococcaceae; \u03b1 and \u03b2 diversity measurements revealed no significant differences in airway microbiota composition between the 5 different groups of patients. It was concluded that IIP, non-IIP, and sarcoidosis are not associated with disordered airway microbiota and a pathogenic role of commensals in the disease process is therefore unlikely.12 A more targeted molecular approach for microbial pathogens in sarcoidosis granulomas most strongly supports that propionibacteria and/or mycobacteria have a role in sarcoidosis pathogenesis. Japanese researchers report molecular evidence of Propionibacterium acnes DNA in sarcoidosis specimens, although the DNA could also be isolated from control specimens.13 The distinction lies in the quantitative differences in P acnes DNA between sarcoidosis and controls. The number of genomes of P acnes in BAL cells was correlated with the serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level and the percentage of macrophages in BAL fluid from patients with sarcoidosis. No significant difference was detected between P granulosum and controls.14 A murine model of sarcoidosis pathogenesis was successfully developed using heat-killed propionibacteria by intratracheal challenge. This model demonstrated the contribution of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-1, TLR-2, and TLR-9 to the development of the polarized, TH1 immune response.15 Another study further confirmed the role of TLR-2 in P acnes\u2013specific sarcoidosis immune responses by demonstrating that P acnes\u2013induced granulomatous pulmonary inflammation was markedly attenuated in TLR-2(\u2212/\u2212) mice compared with wild-type C57BL/6 animals.16 A recent meta-analysis involving 9 case-control studies of P acnes associated with sarcoidosis revealed a significantly elevated sarcoidosis risk (odds ratio 19.58; 95% CI, 13.06\u201329.36).17\n",

One study reported evidence of mycobacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) or RNA polymerase B in 60% of the sarcoidosis granulomas and in none of the controls (P<.00002, chi-square).18 Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA and rpoB amplicons revealed the presence of a novel Mycobacterium, genetically most similar to MTB complex (99% positional identity). Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, Song and colleagues19 found MTB katG peptides in 75% of sarcoidosis specimens compared with 14% of control specimens (P = .0006), in situ hybridization localized MTB katG, and 16S rRNA DNA to the inside of sarcoidosis granulomas. Analysis of Polish sarcoidosis lymph nodes revealed MTB complex heat shock protein (HSP) 70, HSP 65, and HSP 16.20 Molecular analysis of American sarcoidosis granulomas also revealed the presence of nucleic acids of the mycobacterial virulence factor, superoxide dismutase A (sodA), in 70% of the sarcoidosis specimens compared with 12% of controls (P = .001). Sequence analysis of the amplicons demonstrated close positional identity with MTB complex, yet genetically distinct.21 DNA of mycobacterial HSPs has been detected in cutaneous lesions of Chinese sarcoidosis patients but absent from control specimens. Sequence analysis was consistent with MTB, M chelonae, and M gordonae.22 Another study reported the ability of real-time PCR analysis to quantitatively differentiate sarcoidosis from tuberculosis using receiver operating characteristic curves.23 Real-time PCR analysis from these independent laboratories demonstrates that if viable mycobacteria are present within the sarcoidosis granulomas, they are present below the sensitivity of the acid-fast bacilli histologic stain.21, 23 Future molecular efforts should delineate if the identified nucleic acids or proteins reflect actively replicating organisms or persistent proteins.",

Song and colleagues16 noted IgG antibodies to recombinant MTB katG in sera from 48% of sarcoidosis patients compared with 0% in sera from purified protein derivative\u2013negative controls (P = .0059). Sarcoidosis is characterized by polarized CD4+ T cells with a TH1 immunophenotype. The identification of TH1 CD4+ cellular immune responses against mycobacterial ESAT-6 and katG peptides in sarcoidosis peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) suggested that the sarcoidosis immune response may be against mycobacterial virulence factors.27 Distinctions in cellular recognition patterns against virulence factors, such as antigen 85A (Ag85A), can differentiate mycobacterial species. For example, patients infected with MTB recognize distinct Ag85A peptides from those infected with M leprae.28 Further investigation of the sarcoidosis immune response pattern against Ag85A confirmed that the pattern detected was distinct from those in patients infected with MTB or M leprae.\n29 Another report demonstrated systemic CD4+ TH1 immune responses against multiple mycobacterial virulence factors in sarcoidosis patients. These responses were not only against multiple secreted proteins but also against multiple epitopes within a given protein.30 These findings are more analogous with what is observed in patients with active bacterial infection.",

Both of these proteins are synthesized without Sec signal sequences and function to detoxify reactive oxygen intermediates generated by the host macrophage. SecA2 is part of a specialized secretion system that contributes to the virulence of pathogenic mycobacteria by countering the oxidative attack of the host and confers their ability to survive within the host macrophage.32, 33\n",

Comparison of immune responses to mycobacterial katG whole protein between American and Swedish sarcoidosis subjects revealed no differences despite distinctions in patient phenotypic, genetic, and prognostic characteristics. It was also demonstrated that although TH1 immune responses were present systemically, katG-reactive CD4+ 1 cells preferentially accumulated in the lung, indicating a compartmentalized response.34 Patients with or without L\u00f6fgren syndrome had similar frequencies of katG-specific interferon-gamma\u2013expressing peripheral T cells. This study also demonstrated that circulating katG-reactive T cells were found in chronic active sarcoidosis but not in patients with inactive disease.34 The loss of immune responses to mycobacterial virulence factors after resolution of tuberculosis has also been observed.35 Another report demonstrated that immune responses against these mycobacterial virulence factors are present in sarcoidosis diagnostic BAL and that induction of innate immunity by TLR-2 contributes to the polarized TH1 immune response. Recognition was significantly absent from BAL fluid cells of patients with other lung diseases, including infectious granulomatous diseases.36 The detection of immune responses against ESAT-6, katG, and sodA confirms exposure of sarcoidosis patients to a pathogenic mycobacterial species. These proteins are typically secreted during the stage of active mycobacterial replication, compared with expression of other proteins that are expressed when mycobacteria are in the latent state.37, 38 The immunologic analysis performed to date provides a mechanism for more in-depth analysis of sarcoidosis pathogenesis. These proteins can be used to delineate immunologic pathways that contribute to sarcoidosis resolution or disease progression.",

SAA levels are reduced in pulmonary tuberculosis subjects after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy.40 In addition, antibodies against autoantigens, such as zinc finger protein 688 and mitochondrial ribosomal protein L43, have been identified in sarcoidosis BAL and serum. High interindividual heterogeneity was noted.45 Using pulmonary CD4+ T cells from 16 HLA-DRB1\u22170301+ patients, HLA-DR molecules were affinity purified and bound peptides acid eluted. The peptidies were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and analyzed by liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry, resulting in the identification of autoantigens, such as vimentin, and ATP synthase.46 These data support that immune responses against self-antigens are present in local and systemic sites of sarcoidosis subjects.",

As such, although healthy T cells produce high levels of cytokine and exhibit high levels of proliferation and low levels of apoptosis in response to antigen, exhausted T cells gradually lose these normal functions until they can no longer respond to antigen and instead undergo apoptosis on TCR activation. PD-1 up-regulation on T cells plays a significant role in acquisition of the exhaustion phenotype. As an inhibitory coreceptor, signaling between PD-1 and its ligands, PDL1 and PDL2, functions to modulate tolerance to self antigens and limit the robustness of the adaptive immune response to foreign antigens. Exhausted T cells express high levels of PD-1 that correlates well with the systematic loss of cellular function. Recent findings that PD-1 is up-regulated on dysfunctional sarcoidosis T cells as well as the T cells of other granulomatous diseases characterized by microbial antigens, such as MTB48, 49, 50 and schistosomiasis,51 suggest that this phenotype could result from persistent antigen exposure (Fig. 1\n, Table 1\n).",

PD-1 has been reported to inhibit CD4+ T-cell proliferation by blocking cell cycle progression through the suppression of Skp2 transcription.53, 54 Skp2 is the substrate recognition component of the ubiquitin ligase complex SCFSkp2 that binds to and degrades p27kip1, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, thereby allowing continuation of the cell cycle. PD-1 cell cycle impediment and, therefore, proliferation hindrance have been shown to be the result of PI3K/Akt and ERK pathway inactivation.53, 54 PD-1 inhibition of T-cell proliferation has been correlated with increased p27 availability and repression of Cdc25A, a CDK-activating phosphatase.53, 54 PD-1 engagement has also been demonstrated to attenuate TCR signaling by preventing ZAP70 and PKC\u03b8 activation.55\n",
