            "text": "The use of VHF agents as a biological weapon has been the subject of avid speculation in the popular media and dramatized in books and film by showing a panicked populace in the throes of a rapidly spreading epidemic. The reality is likely to be far less cinematic, although public perceptions of the risk may lead to significant social and economic disruption. The most likely method for spread of VHF is by fine-droplet aerosol, although contamination of surfaces, food, and water are other potential sources of infection. A terrorist group equipped with a sufficient supply of a highly contagious VHF agent, such as Ebola or Marburg, in an environmentally stable form, could cause a mass casualty event with high morbidity and mortality. Multiple studies in nonhuman primates have documented the aerosol spread of Ebola virus [8], [9], [10], and droplet spread has been suspected as a mode of disease transmission among infected humans; although, human-to-human aerosol transmission appears to be rare [11].",

Aerosol transmission of Lassa virus, a species in the genus arenavirus endemic in western Africa, has been documented in nonhuman primates under laboratory conditions [12]. During a 1969 outbreak in Nigeria, an index patient transmitted Lassa to 16 other patients in the same hospital ward; transmission was thought to be by way of droplet aerosol spread [13]. As with Lassa virus infection, some viruses from the family of arenaviruses, such as Junin, are typically acquired by way of aerosolization of infected rodent excreta, particularly urine [14], but laboratory workers working with these agents have been become infected through inhalation of aerosols [15]. Similar laboratory-related aerosol transmission has also been described with yellow fever [16].",

A recent review of wild animal mortality and human Ebola outbreaks in Gabon and the Republic of Congo concluded that all human Ebola outbreaks in this region from 2001 to 2003 resulted from handling infected wild animal carcasses [17]. Analysis of 21 carcasses revealed that 10 gorillas, 3 chimpanzees, and 1 duiker, a small African deer, were infected with Ebola. The discovery of wild animals infected with Ebola does not establish that these animals are natural filovirus reservoirs. Ebola is rapidly fatal in these animals, suggesting that they are not the natural host [18]. Research into the natural host for Ebola is ongoing, with recent work suggesting that small mammals with little contact with humans, such as bats, may be a natural reservoir for filoviruses such as Ebola and Marburg [19].",

In addition, 14 (64%) of 22 of health care workers involved with the care of patients infected with Ebola were also infected, despite the establishment of isolation wards. Once stricter infection control measures were instituted, disease containment was achieved. The ease of person-to-person transmission of Ebola virus is supported by the presence of Ebola virus in the skin and sweat glands of infected persons, as documented by immunohistochemical assay [20].",

The route of transmission of this infection is not yet known, although a small number of health care workers have already been infected.

In vitro studies reveal these cytokines lead to shock and increased vascular permeability, the basic pathophysiologic processes most often seen in VHF infection [27]. Another prominent pathologic feature is pronounced macrophage involvement [28]. Inadequate or delayed immune response to these novel viral antigens may lead to rapid development of overwhelming viremia. Extensive infection and necrosis of affected organs also are described. Hemorrhagic complications are multifactorial and are related to hepatic damage, consumptive coagulopathy, and primary marrow injury to megakaryocytes. The increased vascular permeability in VHF infection is thought to be secondary to endothelial injury by immunologic factors rather than direct virally mediated endothelial injury. Direct damage to endothelial cells caused by viral-induced cytolysis is not described as the cause of bleeding diathesis in Ebola virus infection [29]. Multisystem organ failure affecting the hematopoietic, neurologic, and pulmonary systems often accompanies the vascular involvement. Hepatic involvement varies with the infecting organism and is at times seen with Ebola, Marburg, as well as other VHF agents, such as yellow fever. Renal failure with oliguria, although a prominent feature of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) seen in Hantavirus infection [30], may be seen in other VHF infections as intravascular volume depletion becomes more pronounced. Bleeding complications are particularly prominent with Ebola, Marburg, and the South American arenaviruses.",

Suspicion for VHF infection in areas where these viruses are endemic should be high for patients who present even with nonspecific symptoms of viral infection, such as high fever, headache, fatigue, myalgias, abdominal pain, and non-bloody diarrhea. This constellation of symptoms has been well described during the initial prodromal period of VHF infection [3]. Following the terrorist incidents in September 2001, the CDC released instructions for recognizing illness associated with the release of a biologic agent, and listed clinical findings associated with Marburg and Ebola virus infection such as abrupt onset of fever, headache, and myalgias, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, chest pain, and macular-papular rash, particularly involving the trunk [31]. Although this clinical presentation may not raise the specter of VHF infection in a routine emergency department setting in the United States or Europe, several recent cases of imported VHF infection from endemic areas to industrialized countries have been reported [32], [33], [34]. The ease and rapidity of global travel has likely increased the spread of unusual pathogens, including VHF agents.",

The nonspecific prodromal symptoms of VHF infection noted above are often variable and differ between VHF agents as well. Filoviruses, such as Ebola and Marburg, tend to have a more rapid onset of symptoms; arenavirus infection may have a slower progression [3].

In early infection, patients present with conjunctival injection, mild hypotension, flushing, and petechial rash; in later stages of the disease, frank mucous membrane hemorrhage with shock and generalized bleeding may occur. Involvement of neurologic, pulmonary, and hematopoietic systems may also occur [35]. In Lassa fever, hemorrhagic complications tend to be less common than in filovirus infection. Deafness is a common long-term complication of significant Lassa fever infection. Evidence of hepatic injury such as jaundice is seen in Ebola, Marburg, and yellow fever.",

Because of the infrequency of VHF illness in industrialized countries, the initial evaluation of a patient with suspected imported VHF infection should not only attempt to provide supportive therapy or specific antiviral agents as appropriate, but also to rule out other, more common, pathogens that may have specific therapies. The differential diagnosis of VHF encompasses a wide array of both infectious and non-infectious etiologies. Viral and bacterial illnesses that may mimic VHF include influenza, viral hepatitis, staphylococcal or gram-negative sepsis, meningococcemia, salmonellosis and shigellosis, as well as less common infections such as leptospirosis, malaria, rickettsial diseases (such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever), dengue, and hantavirus. Non-infectious causes that can cause bleeding diathesis include disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), idiopathic or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, acute leukemia, and collagen-vascular diseases [3].",

In the case of a bioterrorist attack, no warning would likely be forthcoming and the presentation of numbers of febrile patients with various nonspecific constitutional symptoms would be difficult to link to a common infectious source. During the 2001 anthrax bioterrorism attack, a shared route of exposure served to identify infected individuals as well as those who were potentially at risk for infection [40]. The virulence of these infectious agents and the special containment procedures required to handle them safely can introduce significant delays in definitive diagnosis. Hospital microbiology laboratories and local public health facilities are not equipped to diagnose VHF infection, and samples must be sent to either the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia) or the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID; Frederick, Maryland).",

Because of the rapid progression of disease, particularly in patients with filovirus infection, it has been difficult to establish which patients have the greatest chance for survival. Following an average incubation time of 5\u20137 days for Ebola or Marburg infection, the onset of disease is rapid; death usually occurs within 6\u20139 days of the onset of illness [41]. During the 2000\u20132001 Ebola outbreak in Uganda, a temporary diagnostic laboratory was established on-site, which was able to perform rapid, next-day, testing for Ebola virus by viral antigen capture ELISA and RT-PCR [42]. A retrospective analysis of the data obtained by this field laboratory also demonstrated that viral load correlated with disease outcome. Viral RNA copy levels in patients who died were 100 times higher than among those who survived the infection. RNA copy levels of 108/mL or higher were associated with a fatal outcome; the positive predictive value was >90%. Although somewhat intuitive (ie, patients who demonstrated evidence of overwhelming viremia did worse than those who did not), these data suggest some potential guidelines for the management of a mass casualty incident involving VHF infection. VHF patients (at least those with confirmed filovirus infection) with documented evidence of severe viremia are unlikely to benefit from the most aggressive resuscitative measures. Potentially saving these resources for those patients with a better chance of survival may result in improved overall survival among infected patients.",

In African filovirus outbreaks, infected patients have been grouped into isolation wards with separate areas for health care personnel to change into protective clothing. In industrialized countries, more resources are typically available and isolation precautions are generally required for only one or two patients. In the setting of a bioterrorism attack involving a VHF agent, however, significant numbers of symptomatic patients may be expected. Because of the potential severity of illness, estimation of the numbers of patients requiring critical care is difficult. Case fatality rates for VHF agents vary from 15% to as high as 90%, which suggests that the number of infected patients who might require critical care services is likely to represent at least 50% of symptomatic patients and perhaps nearly all patients with the most virulent forms of filovirus infection.",

The use of convalescent serum (ie, sera from patients who have survived infection) has been suggested as a possible therapy. Late during the 1995 Kikwit outbreak, eight Ebola patients received whole blood transfusions from Ebola survivors. Of these, seven survived. However, there is no clear evidence that links their survival directly to this therapy, and no clear demonstration of benefit can be generalized from these data [73].

In addition to blocking viral replication, recent efforts have attempted to target the VHF disease process itself by inhibiting the action of proinflammatory cytokines thereby attenuating the consumptive coagulopathy that is the hallmark of the disease [77]. Currently, however, there is no effective therapy for VHF infection other than ribavirin for patients with Lassa fever or New World arenavirus infection; treatment for filovirus infection remains supportive.",

The need to administer fluids, electrolytes, and blood products is likely to be significant in these patients. In patients with Lassa fever, dehydration, edema, hypotension, and renal insufficiency are common [38]. The use of invasive procedures, however, should be minimized to reduce the risk to staff of iatrogenic transmission of a potentially lethal pathogen. In published descriptions of imported cases of VHF infection, the time to diagnosis is often significantly delayed. After returning from Sierra Leone in West Africa, a surgeon was hospitalized in the Netherlands with a working diagnosis of typhoid fever, and was not diagnosed with Lassa fever until day 13 and died 3 days later despite the initiation of ribavirin therapy [23]. After diagnosis, 128 unprotected contacts were identified; of the 83 investigated contacts, none showed seroconversion by Lassa virus antibody screen. Although the diagnosis in this case was delayed, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) contact isolation precautions had been instituted early during the patient's hospitalization.",

It has been shown that viral loads also tend to be higher in later stages of infection, which may increase infectivity of blood or body fluids [42]. Despite the intuitive concept that the sickest patients may benefit the most from the highest level of care, there is no clear evidence that more vigorous resuscitation of severely symptomatic VHF patients leads to a decrease in mortality. During the Kikwit Ebola outbreak, however, an increased incidence of coughing and hemoptysis among survivors was thought perhaps to reflect increased use of parenteral fluid resuscitation later during the outbreak [78]. The data available regarding the care of VHF patients in modern emergency department and intensive care unit settings are confined to a few isolated case reports from which no clear generalization regarding improvement in patient outcomes can be derived. In recent naturally-occurring outbreaks of Ebola or Marburg virus, most of the patients were cared for in isolation wards, grouped together with similarly infected patients because of lack of individualized isolation, decontamination, and treatment facilities.",

A review of pediatric Lassa fever cases identified a \u201cswollen baby syndrome\u201d consisting of widespread edema, abdominal distension, and bleeding that ended in death in three of four cases.
