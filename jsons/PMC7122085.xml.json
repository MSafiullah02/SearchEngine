These fatalities are heightened with the periodic epidemics and pandemics of various strains of influenza, Ebola, continued HIV and HCV spread, TB, and many other viruses. These emerging and periodically re-emerging epidemic diseases pose an ongoing threat to global health security. At the end of 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) Department of Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases (PED) was monitoring worldwide viral outbreaks of avian influenza, coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, SARS), Ebola, Hendra, influenza (seasonal, pandemic), Nipah, Rift Valley fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers (including Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever), yellow fever, and ZikaV [2]. The global spread of ZikaV has evolved into a global pandemic since its original emergence in the Americas, since 2015; ZikaV has evolved into a highly virulent and pathological virus for children and adults, becoming a current unparalleled pandemic. The spread of viral diseases is generally associated with fear that can hinder public health efforts [3]. This fear response has been evident in the public\u2019s reaction to the Zika pandemic. This and many other factors closely mirror the setting that has existed with HIV.",

However, the other related viruses have been known for several years to be associated with several severe and often fatal diseases, including central nervous system disorders, viral meningitis, encephalitis, and many other serious health outcomes. Arboviruses are often in the forefront of discussions regarding public health and their global prominence is a major public health concern. In addition to ZikaV, these viruses include dengue (DEN), Japanese encephalitis (JE), West Nile virus (WNV), chikungunya fever (CHIK), hemorrhagic fevers such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV) [16\u201319]. However, since 2015, in the Americas, ZikaV evolved into a highly virulent and pathological virus for children, nearly seven decades after its discovery. ZikaV has further evolved into strains that are more virulent and lethal for adults as well [19, 20]. In fact, this process of evolving toward increased pathogenicity (pathogenization) appears to be ongoing. Globally, there is an increased association of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) with ZikaV infection as well [21\u201323].",

Occasionally, there can be related muscle pain or headaches. ZikaV manifests itself very much like the common flu, and consequently most people do not seek medical attention when infected. Moreover, like the flu, it can last from several days up to a few weeks. An increased association with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an uncommon disease of the nervous system, has also caused concerns. Death results rarely from ZikaV infection. Be that as it may, at the end of 2016, the most distressing effect of ZikaV infection has been for mothers during pregnancy because ZikaV was associated with a brain birth defect \u2013 microcephaly. Additional complications for infants born of ZikaV-infected mothers include defects of the eyes, ears, and growth [16].",

Early on, after this virus was discovered, immunologists speculated that HIV infection could perhaps be managed through a vaccine approach [38]. Because of further molecular research, it was ascertained that HIV underwent a high mutation rate making the development of vaccines highly difficult [24]. This fundamental molecular understanding of the mutation rate, gene structure, and evolution of HIV and the AIDS epidemic at the county, state, and national levels is still at the forefront of current concern as well.",

Both viruses can have deleterious effects on mothers and newborn children and have the potential to produce major health challenges and negative birth outcomes. Unlike HIV/AIDS for which manageable chronic interventions have been developed over the decades for both adults and children growing up HIV positive, ZikaV causes additional outcomes including intrauterine growth constraints, eye defects, congenital brain abnormalities, and microcephaly risks for infants, and GBS risk for adults [50\u201352]. The immediacy and relationship between ZikaV and pregnancy highlights the viruses\u2019 virulence and capability to cause major health challenges for future generations if it is not immediately controlled (Table 30.1).\n",
