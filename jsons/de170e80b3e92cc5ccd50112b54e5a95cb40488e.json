Checkpoints were created at the COVID-19-free-zone entrance to detect patients with fever (>37.58C) and to screen for symptoms of active infection and/or contact with COVID-19positive individuals. When the risk was considered low, patients were provided with protective surgical masks and sanitized to access the hospital.",

This allowed us not to suspend SLIT because a very efficient drug home delivery service was used by our pharmacy. This has proved to be a fruitful advantage of SLIT over subcutaneous immunotherapy, in allowing our patients to adhere to allergen immunotherapy. As reported in a recent article, 3 allergen immunotherapy should be temporarily discontinued during an active infection and this further adds value to SLIT because this practice is more malleable than subcutaneous immunotherapy.",
