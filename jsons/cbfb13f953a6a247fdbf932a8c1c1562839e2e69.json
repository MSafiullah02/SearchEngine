This approach to medicine enables long-distance patient and clinician contact, reminders, education, care, intervention, monitoring, and remote admissions 1,2 . Though not a novel concept, the role of telehealth has grown with the advent of wireless internet. In recent years, there have been an increased number of studies evaluating telemedicine use and its incorporation in patient care 3 . However, surgical specialties have been seemingly less willing to incorporate aspects of telehealth into their practice. To date, there exist only two reports of telehealth adoption in neurosurgery 4, 5 . In addition, our department previously performed a pilot study evaluating a telehealth application for spine surgery perioperative care, with expanded utilization planned in the future 6 . Nevertheless, there remains relatively minor use of this technology throughout medical fields. This is likely contributable to a number of factors, including an unclear or unidentifiable need and logistical issues, such as reimbursement, interstate licensure, accessibility of technology, liability, and patient confidentiality 2 .",

Because neurological issues are often non-emergent, but also rarely elective, each upcoming appointment was reviewed and scheduled in one of three categories: on-site evaluation (emergent decline representing a likely need for admission), acceptable for telehealth, or acceptable to be delayed for after the COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., patient with 20 years of stable back pain). This communication intends to discuss one institutional experience of rapidly implementing a telehealth workflow, from scheduling through the end of the clinical visit, with a preliminary report of patient volumes since the COVID-19 pandemic began. The approach was to take the recipe for an ambulatory visit and break it down to the most essential ingredients, in an effort to streamline telehealth visits and eliminate any unnecessary components of their in-person predecessors.",

Subsequently, the patient is scheduled in the BlueJeans software and provided with specific instructions via e-mail on how to download and set-up BlueJeans. In addition, patients are sent a hyperlink to upload outside imaging which is retrieved by the coordinator using Life Image Referral Box (Life Image, Newton, MA). Once received, the imaging is incorporated into the electronic health record and is accessible to the provider in a manner similar to a typical ambulatory visit. When appointments are scheduled in BlueJeans, they are assigned a discrete appointment identification number to maximize patient security and confidentiality. The coordinator then follows-up with the patient to troubleshoot any issues with either BlueJeans or image uploading, in order to assure the clinic visit is streamlined on the scheduled appointment day.",

When the APP/resident has completed their portion of the evaluation, the telemedicine attending neurosurgeon then \"enters\". The attending will examine the patient, further assess the HPI, then screen share and describe the radiology findings as the patient observes and discusses. In addition, the attending will place orders and discuss the treatment plan. Attendings are then tasked with triaging patients to the following categories: 1) Emergency surgery -plan direct admission to avoid Emergency Department exposure, 2) Need for elective surgery -post-COVID full shutdown, 3) Conservative management, 4) No surgery needed at this time. Further need for follow-up or intervention is discussed with the patient, and after all questions from the patient are addressed, the visit is completed. The patient is then directed back to the clinical coordinator, as needed, to schedule any additional care ( Figure 1B) .

These include initial set-up for first-time telemedicine users, acclimating providers and staff to the new clinic workflow, as well as ensuring that care was not inadvertently limited to those with better access to technology. For patients without access to video-conferencing capabilities, encounters were conducted by telephone to make sure that urgent clinical issues were not missed. For patients who only had access to a smartphone or tablet, we encountered barriers to the physical examination, including inadequate lighting, incomplete cranial nerve testing (e.g. extra-ocular movements). Video conferencing by computer offered better lighting and field of view for physical examination. Patients using only a smart phone found it more challenging to review the images with the attending clinician and in these cases, the attending clinician spent more time zooming in to areas of pathology for the patient. Some patients declined to use the technology and would only do a telephonic visit after submitting images to the department. These evaluations were certainly more limited, however, this cohort represented less than 3% of the total clinic population.",

            "text": "Telehealth certainly has inherent limitations. Some neurosurgical visits and pathology inherently lend themselves to more straightforward assessment by telehealth, including routine postoperative checks, vascular pathology, and incidentally discovered benign, brain tumors. Other pathologies, such as peripheral nerve conditions, tend to have more subtle findings on physical examination, which are more difficult to assess remotely. Another challenge of telehealth is the reliance of patient's technological sophistication and availability. Despite its limitations, we have seen a number of benefits of telehealth. Patient wait times in the BlueJeans virtual waiting room have been averaging 8 minutes. Because efficiency has improved, overall visit length has become shorter, which has improved both patient and surgeon satisfaction. Further, given the efficiencies that telehealth has created, and an overall reduction in New Patient Visit (NPV) requests during COVID-19, patient lag time, previously 50% of patients waiting more than two weeks for an appointment, has been eliminated for all clinicians. Further, additional time can be dedicated toward ensuring that patients have a more thorough understanding of their condition. This is augmented by the screen share function, which allows the attending neurosurgeon to show the patient the exact same images he or she is reviewing, and to highlight salient radiographic features with the highlight cursor function. Furthermore, the video platform enables patients to be \"examined\" from the comfort of their own home, a setting that may be perceived as less intimidating, in turn making them feel comfortable enough to ask additional questions.",
