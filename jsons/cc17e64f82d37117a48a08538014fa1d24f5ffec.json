Combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs have better test characteristics than either alone. However, with the shortage of vital testing supplies, it is recommended to utilize nasopharyngeal swabs alone given its comparable characteristics to combined testing. 9 Sputum can be tested as well, although induced sputum is not recommended as this is high risk for aerosol generation. It is vital to maintain a differential diagnosis while SARS-CoV-2 testing is pending. COVID-19 has nonspecific symptoms that are shared among a broad array of respiratory illnesses, such as Influenza.

            "text": "Once testing returns positive for SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 is diagnosed, it is important to understand what is currently known about the natural history of this disease. While it is estimated that 20% of patients with COVID-19 will have severe disease requiring hospitalization, approximately 25% of these will require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). 11 The median time from symptom onset to ICU admission is estimated to be 9.5 days, 12 and some of these patients may be admitted to the general medical unit with subsequent deterioration. If the patient's respiratory status is declining or compromised, transfer to an ICU should be considered. Care of patients with COVID-19 in the intensive care unit is not within the scope of this article, and has been discussed elsewhere. 13 There are several factors associated with severe disease, as summarized in Table 1 . These include older age, dyspnea, and presence of comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Laboratory findings such as leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevations in C-reactive protein, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase , and alanine aminotransferase are also implicated in severe disease. 3, 14 Abnormal chest X-rays, or chest CT findings such as consolidation, crazy-paving pattern, bronchial wall thickening, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion are also associated with severe disease. 14 If a patient remains suitable for care on a general medical floor, proper isolation remains paramount. Providers should remain mindful of procedures that produce aerosols, and ensure",

Patients should be instructed to quarantine at home, minimize any close social interactions, and wear a mask for any such interactions. Quarantine should continue until certain conditions are met. Recently, a non-testbased strategy has been adopted for in-home patients. In this strategy, patients can discontinue isolation once there have been three days since resolution of fever, improvement in respiratory symptoms, and seven days have passed since symptoms began. 27 A point of contact should be available for in-home patients to ensure they have met these criteria prior to discontinuing isolation. A patient may be considered for discontinuation of isolation while inpatient if they have resolution of fever without antipyretic medication, improvement in symptoms, and negative results in two consecutive sets of paired nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal PCR swabs at least 24 hours apart. 28 Their contacts should be tested for SARS-CoV-2, even if they remain asymptomatic as shedding can still occur.

The highest risk category of AGPs currently include sputum induction, bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation and extubation, open tracheal and nasotracheal suctioning, nasogastric tube placement, upper GI endoscopy, transesophageal echocardiography, upper airway ENT procedures, and non-invasive ventilation with positive-airway pressure devices and high-flow nasal cannula. Administering nebulized medications is considered low risk in producing AGPs. However, nebulization is deemed moderate risk in producing AGPs if the patient coughs excessively with administration or it is not known how the patient tolerates the nebulized medication. Collection of nasopharyngeal specimens is considered low risk.",
