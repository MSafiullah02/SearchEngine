The lumenal domains of NPC1 are all compatible in the trimeric assembly without interprotomer contact.

Consequently, the TMDs in the three protomers no longer stay in the same membrane plane, and there is slight clash between TM1 in one protomer and TM3 in the adjacent one ( Figure S6B ). This structural model raised several possibilities. If multiple NPC1 molecules bind to a trimeric EBOV-GPcl simultaneously, the FL NPC1 would have to undergo conformational changes to avoid clash at TMDs. Alternatively, binding of EBOV would have to induce deformation of the membrane where NPC1 proteins are embedded. A third possibility is that the GPcl trimer may simply bind to one NPC1.

Structure-Invoked Questions on the Sterol Transfer from NPC1(NTD) to Membrane, Related to Figure 4 (A) The NTD may not be able to reach SSD in the same molecule when it bends toward the membrane. A cholesterol molecule is modeled into the pocket of NTD based on the crystal structure of cholesterol-bound hNPC1(NTD) (PDB: 3GKI). Arg518 is shown as magenta spheres. The SSD is colored yellow. It is noteworthy that the NTD is on the opposite side of SSD in the structure. The distance between TM1 and the closest TM in SSD is > 45 \u00c5 while the linker between NTD and TM1 is about 40 \u00c5 . Furthermore, the relative stability of domains C and I with their respective anchoring TMD repeats may represent a spatial block to impede the placement of NTD to the proximity of SSD in the same protein molecule for direct delivery of the NTD-bound cholesterol to SSD. (B) The molecular mechanism of cholesterol transfer from NPC1(NTD) to the membrane or SSD remains enigmatic. Shown here are speculative models. The pink arrow in the left panel of the upper row indicates the question of whether cholesterol can go from NTD through domains C and I to SSD if NPC1 functions like a RND transporter. Alternatively, NTD may directly deliver the bound cholesterol to membrane (upper right) or to the SSD of an adjacent NPC1 protein (lower row). However, the upper model cannot explain the loss of binding to cholesterol analog due to mutations in SSD unless SSD functions in later steps in cholesterol egress. The ''transfer in trans'' model in the bottom row is completely hypothetical especially when there is no evidence to support oligomerization of NPC1. The mechanism of cholesterol egress awaits further investigations. After sonication on ice, the membrane fraction was solubilized at 4 \u00b0C for 2 hours with 1% (w/v) digitonin (Sigma).

Gao, Qiang Zhou, and Nieng Yan Supplemental Experimental Procedures Expression and purification of the human NPC1 (hNPC1) and NPC2 (hNPC2) The complementary DNAs of full-length hNPC1 and hNPC2 were each subcloned into the pCAG vector. A C-terminal His 10 tag was fused for hNPC1 and a C-terminal FLAG plus His 10 tag (for ITC) or FLAG tag (for transfer assay) was used for hNPC2. HEK 293F cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in SMM 293T-I medium (Sino Biological Inc.) at 37 \u00b0C under 5% CO 2 in a Multitron-Pro shaker (Infors, 130 rpm). When the cell density reached 2.0\u00d710 6 cells per ml, the cells were transiently transfected with the expression plasmids and polyethylenimines (PEIs) (Polysciences). Approximately 1 mg plasmids were pre-mixed with 3 mg PEIs in 50 ml fresh medium for 15-30 min before transfection. For transfection, 50 ml mixture was added to one liter cell culture and incubated for 30 min.Transfected cells were cultured for 48 h before harvesting.For purification of hNPC1, the cells were collected and resuspended in the buffer containing 25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and protease inhibitor cocktails (Amresco).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Binding Affinity between NPC2 and the NPC1 Variants Measured by ITC", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>NPC1 Variants </td><td>Kd (mM) </td><td>NPC1 Variants </td><td>Kd (mM)\n</td></tr><tr><td>FL (pH 7.5) </td><td>216.9 \u00b1 35.3 </td><td>DNTD </td><td>209.6 \u00b1 19.9\n</td></tr><tr><td>FL (pH 6.0) </td><td>15.8 \u00b1 1.2 </td><td>L175A/L176A </td><td>162.9 \u00b1 13.8\n</td></tr><tr><td>R518W </td><td>177.3 \u00b1 15.0 </td><td>Dlinker </td><td>266.0 \u00b1 25.5\n</td></tr><tr><td>NTD </td><td>n/a </td><td>Q88A/Q92A/R96A </td><td>275.5 \u00b1 14.3\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "For preparation of the [ 3 H]-cholesterol bound hNPC2, 300 \uf06dl buffer A (25 mM MES, pH 5.5, and 150 mM NaCl) containing approximately 500 nM [ 3 H]-cholesterol (108.78 dpm/fmol; delivered in ethanol at final concentration of 3%) was mixed with approximately 80 \uf06dg FLAG-tagged hNPC2.
