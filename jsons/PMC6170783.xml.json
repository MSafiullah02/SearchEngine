They can serve as susceptible hosts and be infected while staying in one place and then act as mobile sources of case imports to other populations [1\u20133]. On the one hand, more visitors can lead to substantial benefits for the local economy and businesses. On the other hand, some infectious diseases spread aggressively in major tourism destinations (e.g. Hong Kong, New York, Singapore, Toronto, Beijing), and a large number of visitors can have unexpected impacts on public health [3\u20135]. For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was introduced to Beijing, China by a few infected visitors in early March 2003, resulting in a large epidemic [6\u201311]. Other examples where visitors have played a role in regional or international spread include pandemic influenza [12\u201314], Ebola fever [15] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [16]. Enforcing restrictions on incoming visitors could be an efficient way to control local disease outbreaks [7,17\u201319], but the decision to restrict visitors must be weighed carefully due to the economic and social repercussions.",

Many interventions (such as vaccination and social distancing) create positive externalities, i.e. benefits to those who did not participate in the intervention, because of herd immunity generated by interruption of transmission. Hence, many previous models have illustrated the discrepancy between the optimal individual strategy that maximizes personal interest, and the strategy that serves the group best by minimizing the overall health burden on the population [21\u201326]. Although several factors may alter this picture and have been explored in successive work\u2014such as the beneficial effects of social norms and prosocial vaccination [27,28]\u2014these models often illustrate a conflict between group and individual optima across a very broad region of parameter space, covering most epidemiologically and economically relevant regimes [21,22,24,25].",

In the context of travel decisions, game theory can be used to answer questions such as whether travelling or not travelling to a location is optimal according to a criterion of self-interest, and the answers it provides can be contrasted with optimal control strategy from the health authority perspective, in terms of maximizing overall population utility.",

In contrast with many previous game theoretical analyses of decision making in epidemiological systems in a closed population, for this visitor's game, we find perfect agreement between the individual and group optimal strategies for a range of epidemiologically and economically plausible parameter values. This agreement can be observed in two forms: individual and group optimal strategies both completely reject travelling when the real or perceived disease risk level is sufficiently high, or both strategies allow free travel when the real or perceived disease risk level is sufficiently low. However, disagreement (or conflict) between the individual visitor strategy and the group optimal strategy is observed in two forms: an overload or deficit of visitors compared to the group optimum. In regions where disagreement occurs, the disagreement between the individual optimum (corresponding to a \u2018voluntary entrance\u2019 scheme) and the group optimum (corresponding to a \u2018restricted entrance\u2019 scheme) is significant. During an outbreak, this conflict is likely to occur at any real or perceived disease risk level. More importantly, in this region, the model outcomes are highly sensitive to small changes in infection transmissibility and visitor costs/benefits. For certain parameter regimes, uncontrolled visitor inflow could result in unexpected large-scale outbreaks when the disease risk level suddenly increases by even a small amount, and the local health authority's travel restrictions could effectively control disease outbreaks when visitor inflow is considered to be \u2018overloaded\u2019 during epidemics. Interestingly, the faster the disease risk information is updated, the more likely a discrepancy will occur. Moreover, faster updating of the disease risk information could effectively prevent visitor inflow \u2018overload\u2019 and therefore stop an outbreak.",

During an ongoing epidemic (\u03b1 = 1), we find that both r and  significantly influence the individual equilibrium p* and the group optimum \u03c1* (figure 2).

We observe that both the individual and population optima have the same qualitative relationship with  and r: both optima are monotonically decreasing functions of  and monotonically increasing functions of r. This behaviour is expected, since an increasing transmissibility should reduce both the individual incentive to travel and the group optimal rate of travelling, while a decline in the relative risk of travelling should encourage travel, both individually and as a group. More surprisingly, the sudden transition of the individual optimum from 0 to 1 (as shown in figure 2a) is steeper than that of the population optimum (as shown in figure 2b).\n",

During an epidemic, most locations are expected to receive fewer visitors (with limited visitor entrance) than usual when there is no epidemic. But the model predicts parameter regimes where the group optimal solution requires a higher volume of travel than what is individually optimal: in the blue region of the parameter plane, \u0394\u03c1 > 0, meaning p* < \u03c1* (figure 3a). In this regime, the health authority would wish to encourage more travel than actually occurs. However, if either the disease risk  or the perceived pay-off of disease risk r1 decline even slightly (for instance, due to seasonal factors and/or changing media coverage) the situation is reversed, and the discrepancy in interests \u0394\u03c1 could change from \u0394\u03c1 > 0 to \u0394\u03c1 < 0 (red region in figure 3a). When \u0394\u03c1 < 0, a health authority restriction on visitors is desired and only \u03c1*/p* of the visitors should be allowed to enter in order to achieve the population optimum \u03c1*. In summary, figure 3 shows a surprising contrast to many game theoretical models comparing individual and group optimal outcomes: in large parts of the parameter space, there is no discrepancy. However, when a discrepancy does emerge, it can emerge very quickly with small changes in parameter values, and moreover, the individual optimal travel rate could exceed the group optimal rate, or vice versa.",

(The effective contact rate is defined as the product of the contact rate and transmission probability per contact. It is believed, and is modelled, to be negatively, or at least non-positively, related to reported disease incidence [42,46\u201348,52].) The time lag, i.e. the gap between the pairs of vertical solid and dashed lines of the same colour in figure 4, is fixed at 3 days due to the mixed effects of the incubation period (or the latent period) of SARS infection and the delay of human reaction to the outbreak. The model simulation largely captures the observed SARS epidemic between March and May 2003, as shown in figure 4a,b and fig. 8 of [53].",

Surprisingly, we found perfect agreement between the individual and group optimal strategies for broad ranges of parameter values. When a disagreement between the individual and group optimal strategies occurs, the discrepancy was very large and highly sensitive to small changes in disease transmissibility and visitor costs/benefits. For instance, if disease transmissibility increases by even a small amount, the uncontrolled incoming visitors are capable of causing an unexpected outbreak. This suggests that a discrepancy between the individual and group optima could emerge suddenly in real-world settings, provided that slight changes in economic and epidemiological factors (parameters) occur. However, timely implementation of travel restrictions by health authorities may effectively prevent large-scale outbreaks.",
