To date, 114 human cases of MERS-CoV have been reported, with 54 fatalities. Animal models for MERS-CoV infection of humans are needed to elucidate MERS pathogenesis and to develop vaccines and antivirals. In this study, we developed rhesus macaques as a model for MERS-CoV using intratracheal inoculation. The infected monkeys showed clinical signs of disease, virus replication, histological lesions, and neutralizing antibody production, indicating that this monkey model is suitable for studies of MERS-CoV infection.",

Based on their genotypic and serological characteristics, they have been classified into 3 genera: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus [1] . Coronaviruses are well known for their high frequency of recombination and high mutation rates, which may allow them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches. This is best exemplified by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, which was caused by SARS-CoV [2] . SARS-CoV was shown to have originated from animals, with horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus sinicus) as the natural reservoir and the palm civet (Paguma larvata) as the intermediate host, allowing animal-to-human transmission [3] . Since the SARS epidemic, many other novel CoVs have been discovered in both humans and animals. A novel Betacoronavirus lineage C, including the Tylonycteris bat CoV HKU4 (Ty-BatCoV HKU4) and Pipistrellus bat CoV HKU5 (Pi-BatCoV HKU5), was discovered in the lesser bamboo bat (T. pachypus) and the Japanese pipistrelle (P. abramus) in 2007 in Hong Kong, China. These viruses were found to be closely related to a novel strain of human CoV, referred to as Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), which was identified in Saudi Arabia [4] [5] [6] . This novel human virus is now classified as a lineage C Betacoronavirus that differs from other CoVs previously found in humans, including SARS [7] . To date, 114 human cases of MERS-CoV have been reported, with 54 fatalities [8] .",

Similar to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV is closely related to bat CoVs, suggesting that bats may be the natural reservoir of this family of viruses [9, 10] . Specifically, a virus from Egyptian tomb bats showed 100% nucleotide identity to virus from the human index case-patient [11] . It is currently unclear whether the human cases were a result of direct zoonotic transmission from bats to humans or whether an intermediate host was involved. However, a recent study showed MERS-CoV reactive antibodies in retired racing camels in Oman, which neighbors Saudi Arabia [12] . In Middle Eastern nations, large amounts of camel meat were consumed every year, much of which was imported from African countries like Egypt. This epidemiological evidence may suggest a bat-camel-human viral linkage, while more investigations are needed to define the source of MERS-CoV. Currently, there is no evidence of efficient transmission between humans by MERS-CoV. However, the occurrence of some clusters of cases suggests that human-to-human transmission is possible and has raised concerns regarding the potential of this virus to cause a pandemic similar to that caused by SARS-CoV in 2002/ 2003 [13, 14] .",

The development of animal models for MERS-CoV infection of humans is of utmost importance to study the pathogenesis of this virus and to test the efficacy of potential therapeutic or prophylactic intervention strategies. At present, there are few reports of animal model for MERS-CoV infection, thus limiting further study [15, 16] . Nonhuman primates have played an essential role in our understanding of the various forms of the pathogen, which could reflect variable clinical symptoms and pathology in humans. Previous studies have reported nonhuman primate disease models for influenza, SARS, and other viruses [17] [18] [19] . Therefore, in the present study, we explored the suitability of the rhesus monkey as an animal model for MERS-CoV isolate human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center (hCoV-EMC) infection or disease.",

All research procedures were approved by the ILAS Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Laboratory Safety Committee (LSC).

            "text": "The primary MERS-CoV infection-related pathology in humans was acute pneumonia accompanied by multiorgan dysfunction and acute renal failure, which is compatible with a broad range of tissue tropisms in cell culture susceptibility testing [23] . The pathological presentation of pneumonia was also observed in the infected monkeys ( Figure 3) ; however, no extrapulmonary lesions were found. These findings are consistent with the report by Vincent et al, who reported similar findings of acute localized-to-widespread pneumonia that resulted in mild-to-moderate clinical disease [15] . In humans, renal failure is a major symptom of MERS; however, we observed no pathological changes in the kidneys. The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear and deserve further study. It is possible that dissemination of the virus may not yet have occurred and the virus was limited to the lung, as we did not detect the virus in the blood.",

Neutralizing antibody protection assays showed that the infected monkeys produced neutralizing antibodies that could prevent infection due to rechallenge by MERS-CoV. The results also indicate the potent immunogenicity of MERS-CoV, suggesting the possibility of using the virus as an inactivated or attenuated vaccine.",
