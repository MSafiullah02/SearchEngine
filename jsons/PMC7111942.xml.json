The localization of CVB3 VP1 was detected by a monoclonal antibody against enteroviral VP1. Interestingly, rather than distributing evenly in the entire cell, the untagged CVB3 VP1 was exclusively localized in the nucleus (\nFig. 2B). The localization of untagged CVB3 VP1 was identical to that of EGFP-CVB3 VP1 detected by the same assay (Fig. 2A). This observation implied that the nuclear localization of CVB3 VP1 was not a consequence of passive diffusion but active translocation.",

The alignment showed that two basic amino acids in CVB3 VP1 protein, the 220th histidine (H) and the 230th lysine (K), were substituted by acidic threonine (T) and proline (P), respectively, in EV71 VP1. The amino acid difference in these particular sites might determine the distinct localizations of the VP1 proteins of CVB3 and EV71. Therefore, we performed site-directed mutagenesis to generate two CVB3 VP1 mutants, the VP1H220T and VP1K230P, by substituting the His220 and Lys230 with threonine and proline, respectively, in both EGFP-tagged and untagged CVB3 VP1 proteins (Fig. 4B). In HeLa cells, the VP1K230P protein with K230P mutation still localized in the nucleus, while both the untagged and EGFP-tagged VP1H220T proteins with H220T mutations did not localized in the nucleus. Instead, dotted distribution of VP1H220T was found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4C and D). These data indicate that the His220 was a key amino acid residue in the NLS of CVB3 VP1 protein.",

We did not observed a significant alteration in the expression of NF-\u03baB p65 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) (data not shown). However, the cell cycle in the EGFP-VP1-expressing cells without synchronization treatment was altered significantly from that of the EGFP-VP1H220T-expressing cells at the time point of 48 h post-transfection. Compared to the cell cycle in the normal control group (25.5\u00b11.3% for S phase and 8.0\u00b12.4% for G2-M phase) at 48 h post-transfection, the EGFP-VP1-expressing cells showed prolonged S phase (44.2\u00b10.5%) and shortened G2-M phases (2.5\u00b13.6%), while the EGFP-VP1H220T-expressing cells showed prolonged S phase in less extent (34.1\u00b14.2%) and relatively normal G2-M phases (6.5\u00b12.2%) (\nFig. 6). There was no significant change among the cell cycles of three groups at 24 h post-transfection, possibly due to the plasmids needed time for gene expression. A similar prolonged S phase was also observed in the synchronized EGFP-VP1-expressing cells at 48 h post-transfection (Fig. S4, Supplementary data). These data suggest that the event of CVB3 VP1 nuclear localization alone could sufficiently deregulate the cell cycle.",

However, the EGFP-VP1 protein is about 60 kDa, that is beyond the 40 kDa limit of passive diffusion through the nuclear pores for a globular protein. On the other hand, previous study showed that the conformation of CVB3 VP1 was not globular when it assembled the capsid with VP2, VP3, and VP4 (Muckelbauer et al., 1995a, Muckelbauer et al., 1995b). Therefore, we speculated that CVB3 VP1 protein might own a NLS sequence that helped the EGFP-VP1 protein passing through the nuclear pore. To locate the NLS sequence in the CVB3 VP1 protein, truncation strategy was employed in this study. By expressing two VP1 truncates at about 100-amino acid intervals, the NLS sequence was roughly located near the C-terminal of VP1 protein. Further truncations narrowed the NLS sequence in the region between Met213 and Ile275 (Fig. 3).",

The localization difference between the VP1 proteins of CVB3 and EV71 provided a shortcut for predicting the NLS sequence of CVB3 VP1. NLS is usually a basic amino acid-rich sequence (McLane and Corbett, 2009, Tran and Wente, 2006). The alignment for the Met213\u2013Ile275 sequences showed that two basic amino acids (His220 and Lys230) in CVB3 VP1 were substituted by acidic amino acid threonine and proline, respectively, in EV71 VP1 (Fig. 4A). By expressing the mutants VP1H220T and VP1K230P in HeLa cells, we found that the VP1H220T mutant completely abolished the nuclear translocation (Fig. 4). The result indicates that the His220 is one of the determinative amino acids in the NLS of CVB3 VP1 protein.",

The host chromatin and histone proteins are always the targets of the viral capsid proteins (Bhuvanakantham et al., 2010, Colpitts et al., 2011, Surjit et al., 2006, Yang et al., 2008, Zhirnov and Klenk, 1997). Dengue virus capsid protein can act as a histone mimic to disrupt the nucleosome formation (Colpitts et al., 2011). WNV capsid protein C can bind to human double minute 2 (HDM2) and induce p53-dependent apoptosis (Bhuvanakantham et al., 2010). Influenza virus matrix protein M1 can interact with the core histones (Zhirnov and Klenk, 1997). The nucleocapsid protein N of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus arrest the cells in S phase by directly inhibiting the cyclin-CDK complex (Surjit et al., 2006). To evaluate whether the CVB3 VP1 nuclear localization affects cellular phenotype, the cell cycle of the HeLa cells expressing CVB3 VP1 and VP1H220T proteins was preliminarily analyzed. Our results demonstrate that the VP1 nuclear localization caused a prolonged S phase and shortened G2-M phase in the asynchronous cells (Fig. 6) and a prolonged S phase only in the synchronized cells (Fig. S4, Supplementary data). These data imply that the VP1 nuclear localization may somehow interfere with cellular genome replication or disrupt cell cycle regulators, e.g., cyclin A, CDK2, and retinoblastoma protein (Eguchi et al., 2007). The precise mechanism needs further study.",

The protein synthesis and viral production of CVB3 are dramatically higher in HeLa cells arrested at the G1 or G1/S stage, while the virus-infected cells at the G0 or G2-M stage express less protein and make less infectious CVB3. In addition, CVB3 infection can also disrupt host cell homeostasis by inducing cell cycle arrest through increasing ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of cyclin D1 (Luo et al., 2003). Therefore, the shortened G2-M phase induced by the VP1 nuclear localization may facilitate the biosynthesis of CVB3.",

Plasmid pEGFP-VP1 was constructed by inserting the CVB3 VP1-coding sequence, which contained 843 nucleotides (nt) and coded 281 amino acids (aa), to the Hind III-Xba I site at the 3\u2032 end of the EGFP-coding sequence in pEGFP-C1. A series of truncated CVB3 VP1 sequences were generated from the pEGFP-VP1 by PCR assay (Fig. 3, Fig. 5). The PCR products were purified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and the Gel Extraction Kit WD412 (Huashun Biotech, Shanghai, China). The purified PCR products were digested with Hind III and Xba I (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), and ligated to the pEGFP-C1 that has been digested with the same restriction enzymes. All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing (Invitrogen Beijing, Beijing, China). The primers used in these constructions were listed in Table 1 (Supplementary data).",
