For example, employees who formerly spent all or most of their time working inside their organization's physical boundaries now have to quickly adjust to remote work environments. Due to shelter in place orders and the closure of nonessential businesses, even those who might be well adjusted to remote working conditions are now faced with their own unique challenges due to an inability to seek alternative workspaces (e.g., caf\u00e9s, libraries, coworking-spaces) outside of the home itself. This has likely further limited the segmentation between work and private spheres leading to greater difficulties in \"unplugging\" from work demands (Chawla, MacGowan, Gabriel, & Podsakoff, 2020) . Aside from the increased inability to separate work and private life, the closure of schools and childcare services has increased parental demands for employees, further blurring the lines between work and family spheres. While these work-family interconnections seem particularly demanding for employees with children, single and childless workers are not immune to the negative consequences of such altered working conditions, as they may be at greatest risk of loneliness, a felt lack of purpose, and associated negative effects on well-being (Achor, Kellerman, Reece, & Robichaux, 2018) .",

Keeping with the prior example concerning the need for social relationships, a current panacea for balancing social connections embraced by many organizations involves virtual socialization opportunities such as virtual lunches, coffee breaks, and happy hours (Maurer, 2020b) . While these practices potentially alleviate perceptions of misfit as a result of the abrupt change in the social fabric of the work environment, they may also leave participants feeling unsatisfied as they pine for the social interactions they had in their pre-pandemic worklives (Fetters, 2020; Sacco & Ismail, 2014) . Accordingly, more research is needed to better understand how these transformed community-building practices translate to rebalancing the experienced P-E misfit. Building upon the work of Chawla et al. (2020) regarding the daily recovery activities of employees, for instance, future research could investigate the daily impact and recovery experienced when engaging in virtual social activities with colleagues as a replacement for face-to-face social gatherings.",

Perhaps most notably, the changes we have witnessed in response to the current health crisis have already begun to exacerbate work-family conflict, which refers to \"a form of interrole conflict in which the role pressures from the work and family domains are mutually incompatible in some respect\" (Greenhaus & Beutell, 1985, p. 77) . The past few years have witnessed an increasing interest in and application of family-friendly workplace practices such as flexible work arrangements, services including on-site childcare, and benefits that include childcare subsidies. These policies have been found to be important for reducing family to work conflict (Neal, Chapman, Ingersoll-Dayton, & Emlen, 1993) , particularly among employees working from home (Golden, Veiga, & Simsek, 2006) . But as the current pandemic continues to unfold, the potential for conflict between the work and family spheres may be greater than ever. Indeed, in addition to managing the increased strain that can result from transitioning to remote working (particularly for those not accustomed to such autonomous work environments), employees are having to manage increased childcare concerns with the widespread suspension of schools and child-care services, and cope with constant concerns over the health and safety of family and friends. These newfound demands have further blurred work and family roles, thus making it more difficult than ever to maintain adequate work-family role boundaries (Giurge & Bohns, 2020) .",

For example, insights into whether and how additional types of organizational support, beyond those emotional or instrumental in nature, can help to combat family-work conflict, can support organizations aiming to sustain employee well-being (French, Dumani, Allen, & Shockley, 2018) . One form of support that is likely to be increasingly necessary for employees balancing blurred work-family roles is informational support. In the present context, such forms of support might include helping employees stay informed of recent developments regarding health and safety, whether and when local childcare options or elderly care services are available, and self-development and training opportunities that can help employees adapt themselves to changing roles and requirements.",

Consider, for example, the role of job autonomy, or the degree of discretion individuals have about how and when to do tasks or what methods are used when carrying out their work (Langfred, 2000) , in reducing family-work conflict. In general, increasing job autonomy can help mitigate the family-related pressures that tend to arise within remote work environments by providing employees with sufficient cognitive and emotional resources to manage the additional and often incompatible demands (e.g., Golden et al., 2006 ). Yet, with the spread of COVID-19, many employees are mandated to work from home as opposed to selecting themselves into such autonomous work modes that might have naturally aligned with other employees' needs and preferences. That is, when considering those unaccustomed to working in remote contexts, the extent to which the provision of greater job autonomy will be effective may largely depend on the extent to which an individual values autonomy and associated self-responsibility in the first place (Shin, 2004; Stiglbauer & Kovacs, 2018) .",

Although organizational scholars have devoted scant attention to this segment of the labor market, the limited existing research suggests that single and childless employees may face unique forms of work-life conflict (Picard, 1997; Swanberg, Pitt-Catsouphes, & Drescher-Burke, 2005) . In addition, these individuals may be at particularly high risk of loneliness and feelings of social exclusion (Achor et al., 2018) , possibly due to a lack of binding (family) ties, a felt lack of purpose, and isolation.",

This is not entirely surprising, given that individuals working from home tend to report less inclusion than those within traditional work arrangements (Morganson, Major, Oborn, Verive, & Heelan 2008) . But when combined with recent social/physical distancing measures, closure of non-essential businesses, and shelter in place orders, a felt lack of inclusion and belongingness may become especially salient among childless and single employees (Henning-Smith, 2020), thus posing considerable risk to their mental health and well-being, as well as the productivity of organizations.",

Such relationship-oriented HR systems can help employees build ties both within and outside the organization (Kehoe & Collins, 2017 ) and thus develop a reservoir of resources needed to cope with possible social shocks like the one we currently face, such as by focusing on network-development, training and feedback. Further options include regularly sponsoring professional and social events, where the childless and singles can find meaning, strengthen purpose, and instituting formal mechanisms (such as regular team meetings) to encourage employees to connect with one another (Collins & Clark, 2003) .",

For example, researchers might begin by identifying the various ways in which childless and single employees perceive themselves to be stereotyped or stigmatized at work, given that such negative social cues can magnify employees' experience of social exclusion and thereby misfit (Follmer et al., 2018) -an issue that may be especially salient as employees' belongingness and inclusion are further strained in the current environment. Much of the research on family structure has focused on the stigmas accompanying employees with children -particularly women with children -and the negative consequences associated with such stigmatization (Corse, 1991; Fuegen, Biernat, Haines, & Deaux, 2004 ; for a recent review, see Grandey, Gabriel, & King, 2019) . However, research in fields such as social psychology and gender studies, for example, suggests that, childless and single employees may face their own unique set of stigmas (Park, 2002; Remennick, 2000; Byrne & Carr, 2005) , potentially contributing to harmful health-and well-being-related consequences (Ashburn-Nardo, 2017; Maslach & Jackson, 1985) .",

In particular, the field of entrepreneurship, which focuses on the discovery, evaluation, and exploitation of opportunities occurring in inherently ambiguous and dynamic environments, is likely to offer some valuable insights.",

Although some of these challenges are undoubtedly unique, and thus will require new methods and theories to address, some of the issues employees are currently facing resemble entrepreneurs' daily work experience. After all, entrepreneurs are often confronted with demanding work conditions including high levels of uncertainty and responsibility (McMullen & Shepherd, 2006) , a need to flexibly and continuously adjust to new situations (Rauch et al., 2018) , and a strong interrelatedness of the work and family spheres (Aldrich & Cliff, 2003; Jennings & McDougald, 2007 ). Yet, despite those occupational specificities, many entrepreneurs are highly effective in their job and often report higher levels of subjective well-being than employees (e.g., for an overview see Stephan, 2018) .",

Recent research suggests that some entrepreneurs may be highly susceptible to feelings of loneliness, social exclusion, and reduced well-being (Fernet, Torr\u00e8s, Austin, & St-Pierre, 2016) . Although social support from others at work can generally mitigate these downsides (for an overview see Stephan, 2018) , entrepreneurs typically have far fewer sources of work-related social support relative to traditional employees (Rahim, 1996; Tetrick, Slack, Da Silva, & Sinclair, 2000) . Nevertheless and interestingly, some entrepreneurs overcome these limitations by leveraging alternative, domain-specific sources of social supportsuch as positive feedback from customers -ultimately enhancing their well-being (Anderson & Hughes, 2010; Lechat & Torres, 2017) . Using such inductive approaches to identify such overlooked or untapped sources of social support is likely to be necessary to understand how best to help employees cope with and adjust to the current dynamic work environment.",
