Security is frequently encountered as contextual framework in political health and foreign-policy documents, and the securitisation of health is meanwhile considered a key feature of public health governance [6]. The rapid succession of endemic and epidemic outbreaks perceived as health crises has ultimately contributed to pave the way of health into international relations [7] and shape the securitisation of Global Health promoted by multiple agents at national and international levels who interact to target cross-border threats to health [8]. In fact, acute epidemic outbreaks are often seen to be a symptom of globalisation, while Global Health tends to ignore and conceal long-term diseases like tuberculosis and the structural causes of bad health and health inequalities [9]. The increasing international and political relevance of Global Health calls for more comprehensive governance strategies of institutions and processes, which have an explicit health mandate (Global Health governance), for institutions and processes of global governance which have a direct and indirect impact on health (global governance for health), and for national and regional institutions and mechanisms which are established for contributing to governing Global Health governance (governance for Global Health) [10].",

Since then, high-income countries have pushed the development of an international regime of infectious disease control, mostly driven by their own security interests. The International Sanitary Conference held as early as 1851 is generally considered to be the starting point for international cooperation in health [17, 18]. The primary focus on harmonising quarantine requirements in the European colonial power nations made the conference a crucial step towards international health security concerns. Until today, Global Health is often seen in the context of foreign policy and closely linked to international and health security.",

From this, in close connection with the fields of \u201cHygiene\u201d and \u201cPublic Health\u201d, the predominantly clinical field of \u201cTropical Medicine\u201d developed [20]. At the beginning of the twentieth century, terms such as \u201cMedicine in the Tropics\u201d and \u201cTropical Hygiene\u201d were in the foreground. In this context, tropical institutes emerged on the European continent, which in the important port cities such as Antwerp, Hamburg and London mainly took care of seafarers landing on the coast and performed epidemiological hygiene tasks inland, some of which later came under the responsibility of the Public Health Services [21].",

The main prerequisites and causes for globalisation were technical progress due to product and process innovations, above all in communication and transport through the spread of the Internet and the significant increase in worldwide air traffic as well as flexible and more efficient means of transporting goods and services. The internationalisation and liberalisation of production and trade, increasing digitisation, new means of communication, growing migration pressure due to population growth, protracted conflicts and ecological challenges have further promoted and accelerated this globalisation.",

Regional variations exist in the distribution of these diseases as they disproportionately affect the poorest populations and contribute to a cycle of poverty due to decreased productivity [32]. Although the burden of disease in the poorest regions of the Global South continues to be determined by infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV, countries in this region are simultaneously undergoing a rapid epidemiological transition characterised by a shift from disease-burden profiles dominated by communicable diseases and childhood illnesses to profiles featuring an increasing predominance of chronic, non-communicable diseases along with accidents and injuries [33].",

As a consequent and consistent further development and continuance of Public Health at the international level, Global Health addresses national, regional and international health issues, determinants and solutions in the various sectors directly or indirectly relevant to health, and at their interfaces. This requires interdisciplinary cooperation between politics, science and society as well as an analytical understanding of the complex interrelationships and transdisciplinary action. The concept of Global Health pursues a comprehensive, holistic, multi- or transdisciplinary and human rights-based approach. As a synthesis of Public Health, which lacks an international orientation, and International Health, which pursues a transnational approach but focuses more specifically on actual health sector policy, tropical medicine and development cooperation, the Global Health concept intrinsically includes health problems beyond the influence of individual states and pursues an explicitly political approach. Particular attention is paid to governance issues and challenges, i. e. the politically responsible guidance and rulemaking of governments or other relevant decision-makers in order to ensure the effective performance of the various actors in the health sector and other relevant fields in the public\u2019s interest.",

The latter include a broad array of measures such as restrictions on tobacco access and sales e. g. by sales bans for adolescents or raising tobacco taxes, limiting the use of alcohol and other harmful drugs, enacting speed limits, making the use of motorcycle helmets and seat belts legally binding, introducing legal requirements to reduce air and other environment pollution, and enforcing measures to reduce potentially hazardous components such as salt, sugar and trans fats in commercial food products, among others. The impact of these interventions, which are typically implemented at national levels, on communicable diseases is rather indirect and modest, and opportunities for integrating approaches are still to be found.",

Even more, approaches to implementing health-in-all policies are repeatedly surpassed by biomedical and technocratic approaches that tend to occupy the forefront of public interests and political decision-making. There are barely any Global Health documents that do not mention the social determinants of health; however, the adequate consideration and implementation is lagging behind the aspirations. One reason is that the healthcare sector is organised around special professional interests rather than prepared to deal with the contemporary public and Global Health challenges, which are all cross-cutting in nature and require intersectoral approaches [62]. The most prominent multilateral organisations at the forefront of tackling Global Health, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM), follow a vertical approach, put special emphasis on selected health challenges and use to apply instruments which are specific to a certain disease (e. g. HIV/AIDS in the case of the GFATM, or vaccine provision in the case of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunzations - GAVI) or target group (e. g. children in the case of UNICEF). They have hardly contributed to health-systems strengthening [63] or funding [64]; nor have they pursued broader health-in-all strategies beyond improving health services and healthcare delivery. This imbalance is particularly reflected in Global Health initiatives such as GAVI dedicated to saving children\u2019s lives and protecting people\u2019s health by improving access to immunisation in poor countries. The general public around the globe is usually much less aware of the economic, social, political and other determinants of health than of the impact of worldwide epidemics on economic, social, political and other conditions of human life [65].",

At the peak of the outbreak, the public and political debate is widely dominated by biomedical and biotechnical topics and restricted to the expertise of virologists and immunologists who form a kind of opinion monopoly that is able to determine political decision making as well as the reporting of the epidemic all over the world. The unceasing and massive coverage of coronavirus by policy and media pushes other policy issues and reporting to the margins, [66] only few non-mainstream journals analyse the pandemic in the context of social, political and economic determinants [67].",

This vision is lacking in many medical and health-science publications where technological measures prevail over strategies to eliminate and address underlying causes [68] or is incomplete in others [69]; and it has not yet found its place in the broader debate on Global Health. The German Platform for Global Health, an association of trade unions, non-governmental organisations and scientists, repeatedly points out the significance of the social conditions of health and the need to bring non-medical determinants more into the national and international health debate [70, 71]. In today\u2019s globalised world, the main factors influencing people\u2019s well-being and health can be controlled and influenced less and less at the national level alone.

Rather than enhancing the local health system capacities, public policies in the name of Global Health security tend to focus on the protection of national borders in the Global North against perceived health threats from countries in the Global South [86].

Scientists from low-income countries are only gradually developing their own requirements and adapting their profiles for meaningful exchange with the Global North [93]. The relationship between institutions in North America, Europe and Australia, on the one hand, and research and care institutions in former colonial low-income countries, on the other, is often reflected in a cooperation that is regarded as ahistorical, apolitical and uncritical [94].",

The fact that in recent years the global context of health has increasingly come to the fore is encouraging as long as Global Health is not reduced to epidemiological preparedness for preventing the cross-border spread of infectious diseases particularly to high-income countries. Biomedical and technocratic reductionism leads to selective access to health care, and privatisation increases rather than reduces health inequalities. Global Health has to emphasise the social, economic and political determinants of health. Health-in-all policies are required for ensuring Health for All and sustainably reducing health inequalities within and among countries. Global Health requires an understanding of human rights that does not regard health as a profitable \u201cbusiness model\u201d, but as the aspiration of every human being. It must first and foremost pursue the enforcement of the universal right to health and contribute to overcoming global hegemony. Global Health must also address the causes of the impoverishment of the Global South, namely colonialism, the economic order oriented towards short-term profit maximisation and the ecological exploitation of natural resources in particular. Responsible Global Health policy has to address the causes of existing problems and must not limit itself to restoring the conditions that led to the global and planetary health crisis.",
