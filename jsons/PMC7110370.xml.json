A qualified individual using a cuff sphygmomanometer on three different occasions spanning 2 weeks measured blood pressure. Secondary HT, renal disease, and heart disease were excluded by the patients' general practitioners (GP). All subjects had normal renal function and no evidence of secondary HT by standard clinical evaluation carried out to the satisfaction of the GP. Normotensive subjects (NT) were required to have a BP <130/90 mm Hg and parents who were both normotensive past the age of 50 years. In addition, subjects could not have heart or kidney disease. These individuals were recruited at the Sydney Red Cross Blood Bank. Clinical history was obtained by a standardized questionnaire and examination by a qualified health professional for both groups. The University of Sydney Ethics Committee approved the study and the subjects gave informed consent. Demographic characteristics (mean \u00b1 SD or mean \u00b1 SE, as appropriate) for the 152 HT and 193 NT subjects are listed in Table 1.\n",

Primers for genotyping of these were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (Sydney, Australia) (Table 2). The PCR protocol was the same for both SNPs. The 22 \u03bcL PCR mixture contained 100 ng genomic DNA, 0.25 pmol each of primer, 0.1 mmol/L each of dNTP, 1 U HotstarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen), 50 mmol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2.

The sites where the enzymes cut are listed in Table 2. The intron 1 variant gave two fragments of 305 and 166 bp (G allele) when cut, or a single band of 471 bp (A allele) for the uncut product. For the intron 3 variant, fragments of 281 and 185 bp (A allele) or 466 bp (G allele) were generated. Bands were visualized on ethidium bromide\u2013stained agarose gels after electrophoresis.",

Our study design provided at least 80% power to detect an existing association with HT in the female subjects with HT, with a two-tailed type 1 error of 0.05 and an allelic odds ratio of 2.0. Thus, if an association with HT were present, we should have been able to detect it.

Our study design (using the offspring of two HT parents) meant that the subjects with HT used were drawn from a general hypertensive population (\u223c1520 individuals) that was 10 times greater than the number of subjects studied.6 Such a study design also leads to a considerable reduction in sample size requirements for detection of the same population effect of genetic variants (W.Y.S. Wang, unpublished observation). For example, assuming a multiplicative effect of alleles and the absence of gene\u2013gene and gene\u2013environment interactions, in the case of an autosomal disease allele with population frequency of 0.20 that contributes to HT with a disease odds ratio of 1.5, sampling based on disease status alone would require at least 267 case subjects and control subjects to provide 80% power for a significant threshold of P = .05; however, when considering the disease status of both parents as being affected, only 64 samples might be required in each group to detect the same effect. The reason for this is the disease allele frequency of the specially sampled case subjects would be higher than that of their affected parents. The opposite is true for the control subjects. Therefore, despite having the same underlying effect in the population, the disease odds ratio between the two selected groups is increased. As a practical demonstration of increased power when sampling is based on family history of HT, we reanalyzed data in one of our reports20 using a test for trend that allows the expectation for increased risks in different groups, that is, subjects with HT with two HT parents should have more genetic risk than subjects with HT with only one HT parent. This gave a P value of .0066, as can be seen below:",

The latter is regarded as overly severe, thus risking the elimination of a true positive finding.23\n",

Elevated Ang II could be blunted by compensatory changes in Ang 1\u20137, kinin metabolites, the apelin system,17 or nitric oxide.25\n",
