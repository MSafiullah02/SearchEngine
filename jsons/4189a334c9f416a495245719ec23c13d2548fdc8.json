            "text": "Covid-19 is a new coronavirus disease first described in December 2019. This respiratory illness is severe and potentially fatal. Severe cases make up to 15%, lethality ranges between 1.5 and more than 10 %. What is urgently needed is an efficient pharmacological treatment for the treatment of severe cases. During the infection of alveolar epithelial cells of the lung, the ACE2 receptor has a central function. The antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) impair in vitro the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 without significant change of cell-surface ACE2 and, therefore, might be potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Starting inhibition at 0.1 \u00b5M, CQ completely prevented in vitro infections at 10 \u00b5M, suggesting a prophylactic effect and preventing the virus spread 5 hours after infection. In a first clinical trial, CQ was effective in inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promotion of virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease. In addition, HCQ, which is three times more potent than CQ in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (EC50 0.72 \u00b5M), was significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Theoretically, CQ and HCQ could thus be effectively used in the treatment of SARS-CoV pneumonia. From a pharmacological standpoint, however, the major problems of oral treatment with these drugs are possible severe side effects and toxicity. Concretely, this relates to (a) the inconsistent individual bioavailability of these drugs at the alveolar target cells, depending on intestinal resorption, hepatic first-pass metabolism and accumulation in liver, spleen and lung, and (b) the need for a relatively high concentration of 1-5 \u00b5M at the alveolar surface. Therefore, we propose in a first dose estimation the use of HCQ as an aerosol in a dosage of 2-4 mg per inhalation in order to reach sufficient therapeutic levels at the alveolar epithelial cells. By using a low-dose non-systemic aerosol, adverse drug reactions will markedly be reduced compared with oral application. This increase in tolerability enables a broader use for prevention and after contact with an infected person, which would be an advantage especially for the high-risk, often multi-morbid and elderly patients. Empirical data on self-medication with a one-week aerosol application by two of the authors is presented. Inhalation was well tolerated without relevant side effects.",

Currently, as no effective antiviral pharmacological treatment is available, lethality seems to depend on individual risk factors including age, gender and hypertonia and regarding the course of the disease in cases of severe pneumonia, on the availability of large-scale intensive care units and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (5, 6).",

However, the typical clinical course of this infection suggests that the virus load in the respiratory tract increases stepwise starting with mild symptoms and ending in up to 15 % of patients with severe and potentially life-threatening pneumonia (4). Therefore, the treatment with a drug which inactivates the cell receptor for the virus should start after exposition with high risk, e.g., when one person was infected very recently with the virus or is in the early phase of the disease. Moreover, our hypothesis differs from the standard recommendation to try HCQ/CQ in a late phase of the disease when other antiviral drugs failed. We believe that a respiratory virus infection should be treated very early because the severe acute respiratory syndrome is caused by ion channel activity of the viroporin 3a which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome (22) . Unfortunately, as of now, there is no evidence yet that HCQ/CQ has any inhibiting effect on this inflammasome activation.",

Such high dosages may have several toxic side effects, strongly limiting their utilizability as preventive treatment. An aerosol application of drugs which are primarily intended to act on the respiratory system is well established for several drugs, e.g. in the treatment of asthma with corticosteroids, e.g. budesonide (23, 24) and beta mimetica, e.g. fenoterol (25) , and in the early treatment of influenza (during the first 48 hours) with neuraminidase blockers like zanamivir (26) . Moreover, there are reports of undergoing clinical studies of aerosol interferon alpha (novaferon) for treatment of COVID-19 (27) leading us to advocate a clinical trial to evaluate also HCQ/CQ in this application form.",

Although it is difficult to predict in the lung the effects of blood perfusion and on the other hand accumulation of HCQ, it seems reasonable to substitute 2-400 mg Since HCQ/CQ is an old drug with a known profile of side effects, also for much higher dosages, it might also be appropriate to perform open pilot studies with higher numbers of cases and compare (in a non-randomized study) the clinical course and final result in patients with similar symptoms but without HCQ inhalation.",

            "text": "of the virus, (2) the alkalizing medication elevates the pH value of the endosomes. Since Cathepsin L requires an acidic environment to crack the viral S protein, virus induced activities are reduced. Other possible explanations for the antiviral effect include a reduction in MAK kinase activation or a disruption of the maturation of the viral M protein. Further, CD8+ cells directed against the virus may be activated and thereby lead to a decrease of pro-inflammatory cytokines (32). Chinese scientists from Peking University found low inhibitory concentrations of 0.72 \u00b5M for the hydroxy derivative in direct comparison to chloroquine (5.47 \u00b5M) in cell culture experiments with the pathogen SARS-CoV-2. Both figures are EC50 values, that is, concentrations that cause half-maximal inhibition of virus replication. They calculated that with an initial dose of 400 mg twice daily and a subsequent dose of concentrations in the lung tissue than needed for in vitro inhibition. However, the concentrations have not been measured and clinical studies that examine the possible benefit of such treatment are not yet available (15). Another group of Chinese virologists published slightly different EC50 values for the in vitro inhibition of viral replication by CQ and HCQ (3.8 \u00b5M and 4.1 \u00b5M at 0.02 MOI = multiplicities of infection). As the results depend on the type of cell culture, the cells used, the amount of viruses used for infection, the time of evaluation and other factors, this is not surprising (14, 35). Moreover, a first clinical study with more than 100 patients demonstrated superiority of chloroquine phosphate to controls in inhibiting exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promotion of virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease without severe adverse reactions (11). In a non-randomized open-label trial in 20 patients, hydroxychloroquine treatment was significantly associated with viral load reduction/disappearance in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (12).",
