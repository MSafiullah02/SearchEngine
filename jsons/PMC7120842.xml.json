It is based upon the principle that suppression of RNA silencing would lead to the expression of silenced reporter gene, such as the GFP transgene in this particular case. Here we use the GFP-silenced transgenic tobacco plant, cv. xanthi, where the GFP gene is chromosomally integrated but silent in expression due to posttranscriptional gene silencing. Various ORFs of the viral origin are allowed to ectopically express in the leaves of the silent plant following agro-inoculation. In some cases the ectopic expression will lead to reversion of silenced phenotype, i.e., GFP expression. The reversion of expression can also be monitored by Northern analyses. The candidate viral ORFs that lead to the eventual reversion of GFP expression could be adjudicated as the suppressors of RNA silencing.",

            "text": "We have made use of the characteristics of rolling circle replication (RCR) of a geminivirus-based amplicon (VA) that replicates like an independent episome in plants (20,21). The left and right borders of a standard plant transformation vector (e.g., pCAMBIA or pBI121) are joined by a DNA segment consisting essentially of the following three components. These include the replicon part of the DNA-A component of Mung bean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV) containing the cis elements of replication origin (CR) along with three ORFs, namely Rep, AC2, and AC3; the transcription unit of GFP; and the replication origin alone (CR) (Figs.\n1a and 1b). When the resultant plasmid (say, pCAMBIA-VA/GFP) is introduced in the leaves of N. xanthi by agro-inoculation, the DNA spaced between the two CRs excise out to form a replicating episomal circle. The Rep protein of MYMIV essentially mediates this excision and subsequent initiation of replication (RCR). The amount of DNA replication can be measured by three independent means, as mentioned later. The episomal replication and consequent GFP fluorescence are detected within a week of agro-inoculation at the inoculated spot, but the fluorescence disappears at two weeks\u2019 postinoculation due to silencing of the GFP transcripts and short life-span of the GFP protein. The silencing effect is even more potent when the AC2 of VA is mutated, confirming the nature of AC2 as an RNA silencing suppressor. This disappearance, however, can be restored if the RNAi-suppressor-expressing construct could be co-introduced along with the pCAMBIA-VA/GFP construct using the Agrobacterial route. In the presence of the suppressor, more episomal replication along with the stable GFP fluorescence is observed even at four weeks\u2019 postinoculation.\n\n",

            "text": "The outline of the experiment is sketched in Fig.\n2. The method is based on the reversion of reporter gene GFP expression from the pre-established silenced state in the presence of viral ORFs. The GFP-silenced and wild-type leaves, under U.V. (~311 nm) exposure, fluoresce red light (~680 nm) due to the presence of chlorophyll, while the GFP expression leads to green fluorescence at ~510 nm. The molecular analyses involved probing the mRNA and siRNA levels of GFP in the presence and absence of the viral ORFs.\n\nThe GFP-silenced Nicotiana tabacum cv. xanthi can be made by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of the wild-type Nicotiana plant using the pBI121-GFP constructs. A transgenic event is selected in which the chromosomally integrated GFP gene is silent in expression in Nicotiana xanthi. The transgenics are screened for loss of fluorescence following UV irradiation on leaves, while the presence of the GFP gene is confirmed by both PCR and Southern analyses. We also confirm the silencing by the very low level of GFP-mRNA and the high level of GFP-siRNA in the Northern blots of the RNAs isolated from the silent plants. The young leaves of the transgenic plant are used for the screening assay.Take up the homogeneous culture suspension of Agrobacterium constructs (obtained in Section\n3.1) in a 5-mL needleless syringe. Infiltrate the selected young leaf using the culture suspension and by generating a vacuum with the help of a finger on the dorsal side of the leaf and mouth of the syringe on the ventral side. As the vacuum is created, push the plunger of the syringe to transfer the culture into the leaf through the stomata pores without detachment of the leaf from the plant (see\nNotes 2 and 3). Label each agro-infiltrated leaf for the construct used for infiltration. A plant should not be infiltrated for more than two ORFs for best results (see\nNote 4).Pluck the inoculated leaves from the plant starting from 4 days\u2019 postinfiltration (d.p.i.) for fluorescence and biochemical analyses. The incubation period is required for the optimum expression and suppression activity of the viral ORF (see\nNote 5).Visualize the leaves under UV for fluorescence. In case of an empty vector (pBI121), SARS 3a and N, the infiltrated zone will appear red at any time postinfiltration, while the MYMIV-AC2, FHV-B2, and SARS-7a infiltrated zones will fluoresce green at about 8 d.p.i. (Fig.\n2). Use the leaves for total RNA and small RNA isolation. There are various common laboratory methods for this, and an example is given below.Isolate total RNA from plant tissue by the TRIzol reagent method (Gibco BRL) (see\nNote 6).\nHomogenize plant tissue (see\nNote 7) in liquid nitrogen and add TRIzol reagent to the homogenate (1 mL per 100 mg of tissue). Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.Add 200 \u03bcL of chloroform per 1 mL of TRIzol reagent to the mixture, mix by vigorously shaking for 15 sec, and incubate again at room temperature for 2\u20133 min. Centrifuge the homogenate at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C.Pipette out the supernatant into a fresh RNase-free 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube while the pellet containing cell debris is discarded. Add about 0.7 volume of isopropanol to the supernatant, centrifuge to precipitate the RNA, and pellet down at 10,000 x g for 10 min.Wash the pellet with 75% ethanol made in DEPC-treated water, air-dry the RNA, and dissolve in DEPC-treated water (see\nNotes 8 and 9).\nThe total RNA is further processed for small RNA isolation as follows.\nHeat the RNA samples at 65 \u00b0C for 10 min to disrupt the association between larger- and smaller-size RNA molecules and also to facilitate dissolving of the pellet.Place the dissolved RNA immediately on ice and add PEG (MW 8,000) to a final concentration of 5% and NaCl to a final concentration of 0.5 M. Mix and keep in ice for 30 min (see\nNote 10).Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 min to pellet down the high molecular weight nucleic acids.Collect the supernatant (which contains mainly the small RNAs, namely siRNA, miRNA, degraded RNA, tRNA, and rRNA, etc.), add three volumes of absolute ethanol to it, mix well, and keep at \u201320 \u00b0C for 2 h.Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 min. The pellet thus obtained contains all forms of small RNAs.Wash the pellet with DEPC-treated 75% ethanol, air-dry, and dissolve in DEPC-treated water before using.\nNorthern analysis to detect GFP mRNA and siRNA level in the infiltrated leaves is carried out as follows.\nmRNA level of GFP:\ni.Size-fractionate total RNA (as obtained in step 5d) on 1.0% formaldehyde denaturing agarose gel in 1X MOPS running buffer.ii.After completion of the run, rinse the gel in DEPC-treated water to remove the formaldehyde from the gel and saturate with 10X SSC for 45 min.iii.Transfer RNA to nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham) by capillary blotting in 10X SSC buffer.iv.Cross-link the RNA to membrane using a UV cross-linker (Stratagene).v.Carry out prehybridization and hybridization for the RNA blot following standard protocols (see\nNotes 12 and 13).vi.Following hybridization, wash the membrane in 2X SSC, 2% SDS, twice (15 min each time) at room temperature and then twice with 1X SSC, 0.2% SDS, at 65 \u00b0C for 25 min each time.vii.Check the membrane regularly for counts using a Gieger\u2013M\u00fcller counter, and make the final washes in 0.1X SSC for 15 min at 60 \u00b0C.viii.Gently wipe the membrane to remove extra buffer and place on an equal-sized Whatman filter sheet (see\nNote 14).ix.Wrap the membrane in Saran Wrap and expose to the storage phosphor screen for a desired period of time. The presence or absence of the band in the membrane is visualized by scanning with a phosphorimager scanner. We use Typhoon 9213 and then analyze the intensity of the autoradiographic band using the Image quanta TL program.\nsiRNA level of GFP:\ni.Resolve the low molecular weight RNA containing siRNA (as obtained in step 6f) in 15% acrylamide-7 M urea gel in 0.5X TBE by overnight electrophoresis at 2.5 V/cm (see\nNote 11).ii.Transfer the nucleic acids to a nylon membrane by electro-blotting in 0.5X TBE transfer buffer at 20 V for 40 min.iii.Cross-link in a UV cross-linker as before.iv.Perform prehybridization in 30% formaldehyde hybridization buffer for 2 h with mild agitation at 42 \u00b0C followed by hybridization with the GFP probe for 14\u201316 h (see\nNote 12).v.Following hybridization, wash the blot at 40 \u00b0C with 0.5X SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min, and analyze in a phosphorimager (see\nNotes 13 and 14).\n\nThe GFP-mRNA levels are generally higher in case of RNA isolated from leaves infiltrated with FHV-B2, MYMIV-AC2, and SARS-7a ORFs but are below a detectable level for the empty vector, SARS-3a, and SARS-N ORFs. However, the GFP-siRNA level is higher for the empty vector, SARS-3a, and SARS-N and lower with FHV-B2, MYMIV-AC2, and SARS-7a. These findings corroborate well with the fluorescence data, thereby proving the RSS activity of FHV-B2, MYMIV-AC2, and SARS-7a. The reversal of the silencing assay is indeed a very easy and reliable method to screen and identify various viral ORFs with RSS activity.\n",

A GFP transcription unit of 1.4 kb consisting of 35S promoter, GFP ORF, and the transcription terminator was prepared keeping the MYMIV-based replicon and the CR at the flanking ends of the transcription unit as shown in Fig.\n1b. The resulting construct, when introduced in plants, generated an independently replicating episomal circle of 3.2 kb (Fig.\n3a) (20,21). The circle could be detected as a 3.2-kb Southern band and could be distinguished from the unreplicated DNA that would reveal as a ~4 kb band (Fig.\n3c). The presence of the circle could also be confirmed from a PCR band of 1.6 kb using a set of divergent primers as mentioned later. There won\u2019t be any PCR amplification from the unreplicated DNA using the same set of primers (Figs.\n3a, 3d). At the initial phase of episomal replication, the GFP accumulates showing the green fluorescence in the leaves harboring the replicated DNA. However, around 12 d.p.i., the GFP fluorescence starts fading, showing the signs of GFP silencing (Fig.\n3b). At three weeks\u2019 postreplication, the GFP fluorescence is almost lost. Thus, the GFP serves as a marker of the initial phase of replication, as its expression would be directly proportional to the replication of the episome by RCR. The primary plasmid construct, which is introduced in the plant using agro-inoculation, is named VA/GFP and its backbone is pCAMBIA 1391Z (Fig.\n3a).\n\n",

            "text": "On the other hand, if the VA/GFP construct is co-inoculated with one expressing the suppressor of RNA silencing, the GFP fluorescence remains stable for more than 30 d.p.i. The suppressors not only stabilize the GFP fluorescence but also enhance the amount of episomal replication (Figs.\n4a, 4b).\n\nThe episomal elements of the VA/GFP construct can be cloned in a standard plant transformation vector. We cloned the amplicon element at the HindIII-EcoR1 restriction sites of the pCAMBIA vector (Fig.\n1b or 3a) and named it viral amplicon (VA) because of its competence to release the episomally replicating circle. We introduced the pCAMBIA-VA/GFP construct into Agrobacterium strain LBA4404 and grew it in a similar manner as described in Section\n3.1 (see\nNote 1). The screening for RSS activity can then be carried out using the following procedures:\nMix VA/GFP and either the test viral ORF/empty vector (we used the same ORF that was tested with reversal of silencing assay) or the empty vector carrying culture suspensions of Agrobacteria at 1:1 ratio and agro-infiltrate onto wild-type Nicotiana tabacum cv. xanthi leaves following the procedures described in Section\n3.2 (see\nNotes 2, 3, and 4).Pluck the leaves after 18 d.p.i. and observe under UV for the level of GFP expression (Fig.\n4) (see\nNote 5).Extract the genomic DNA from the infiltrated zones using the following steps:\nGrind the plant material in liquid nitrogen (2 g of fresh tissue or 0.5 g of dried tissue) to fine powder and add 5 mL of CTAB buffer to make a slurry (see\nNote 7).Transfer the slurry to an autoclaved propylene tube and incubate at 60 \u00b0C in a shaking water bath (100 rpm) for 35 min.Add an equal volume of chloroform\u2013isoamyl alcohol (24:1) and mix gently.Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Carefully remove the upper aqueous layer with a wide-bore pipette. Add 0.7 vol. of isopropanol and mix gently by inversion.Centrifuge the sample at 10,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature to precipitate the nucleic acids.Discard the supernatant and wash the pellet with 80% ethanol two to three times.Air-dry the pellet until the ethanol disappears (about 30 min). Dissolve in 0.5\u20131 mL of TE buffer and collect in an autoclaved 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube.After dissolving the nucleic acids, add 5 \u03bcL of RNase A (10 mg/mL) and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min.Add 1/2 volof Tris-saturated phenol and 1/2 volof chloroform\u2013isoamyl alcohol (24:1), mix, and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature.Transfer the upper aqueous layer to a fresh 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube, mix an equal volume of chloroform\u2013isoamyl alcohol (24:1), and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Repeat this step twice.Finally, take out the upper aqueous phase and precipitate the DNA with 1/10 vol of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2 vol of ethanol. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C.Wash the pellet with 70% ethanol, air-dry, and dissolve in 0.3 mL of sterile distilled water (see\nNotes 8 and 9).\nUse the isolated DNA for the PCR-based replication analysis. Design two primers, GFP F and AL1 R, such that a PCR amplification product of 1.6 kb will result if the circular episome template is present. The parental DNA template of around 11 kb would not produce any PCR product because of the nonprocessive characteristics of the thermophilic DNA polymerase (lane 1, Fig.\n3d). Perform 50-\u03bcL PCR for 21 cycles using 0.5 mM dNTPs at 54 \u00b0C annealing temperature and 72 \u00b0C extension for 2 min (see\nNote 14). Test that the DpnI digestion of the DNA template prior to PCR does not make any difference, indicating the replicative nature of the episomal DNA template.Analyze the PCR product along with a 1-kb marker ladder in a 1% agarose gel with 1X TBE running buffer and observe in a UV transilluminator for EtBr-stained bands.\n",
