            "text": "In autumn 1998, nocturnal bird migration at Falsterbo was recorded over a period of three months by means of a passive infrared device. At the same place a standardised trapping scheme is in operation. This study reveals for the first time a positive correlation between the migratory intensity of birds aloft and the numbers of trapped birds. By relating the migratory patterns of single species with the nocturnal migratory intensities, we show that the species composition aloft can at least partly be deduced from the number of grounded birds. The numbers of trapped pre-Saharan migrants were related more strongly to the migratory intensity of the preceding night than were the numbers of trans-Saharan migrants. Assuming that the number of trapped birds varies according to the weather to the same extent as the migratory intensity of birds aloft, we conclude that in shorter range migrants the decision to engage in a migratory flight is influenced more strongly by weather conditions, and that the migratory activity of trans-Saharan migrants is possibly more intensely controlled by their endogenous migratory urge.",

Bird-trapping data is, however, often biased towards certain species and/or age classes, and numbers depend on the location of the capture site with regard to topography and habitat, trap types (e. g. mesh size of mist nets), the position of the traps in the vegetation, and weather (Degen & Jenni 1990 , Jenni et al. 1996 . Moreover, studies of bird migration are faced with the problem that non-migrating birds, such as individuals on post-breeding or post-fledging dispersal, can hardly be differentiated from migrating individuals (Jenni 1984 ).",

In general, they do not allow species identification, but only a differentiation between broad groups of species (Bloch et al. 1981) .

The camera (Long-Range-Infrared-System LORIS, IRTV-445L, Inframetrics, Massachusetts, USA) was placed on the ground inside the Lighthouse garden and directed vertically upward. Birds of the size of an average passerine are detectable by the camera up to 3000 m above ground level against the clear sky (Liechti et al. 1995) . The thermal radiation emitted by their bodies is represented on a monitor as dark dots. If birds pass close by birdshaped silhouettes can occasionally be observed, but species can never be identified. The flight altitude of the bird is estimated according to its silhouette size on the screen; the silhouette size is assigned to one of seven height classes. The calibration of the height classes was achieved by measuring the distances to the targets with the pencil-beam of a tracking radar (Bruderer & Liechti 1994 , Liechti et al. 1995 . The flight directions are assessed according to the clock face method used in moonwatching (Lowery & Newman 1955) . Since the opening angle of the camera of 1,4\u00b0leads to an altitude dependent probability of detecting birds aloft, number of birds is translated into migration traffic rate (MTR). MTR is calculated as the number of birds crossing perpendicularly a line of one kilometre length in one hour. A detailed description of the method is given in Zehnder et al. (in press) . Birds migrating in the time interval between the end of civil twilight at dusk and the beginning of civil twilight at dawn were considered as night migrants (see Zehnder et al. in press) .",

The pentads were selected according to Berthold (1973) . The absolute numbers per day of the long term averages (expected numbers) and the number of birds ringed each morning in the autumn of 1998 (observed numbers) were transformed to percentages per species of the observation period. The difference of these relative numbers was related in a linear regression to the mean MTR (log transformed) of the preceding night. This analysis was restricted to bird species with ringing totals in 1998 of n > 100 (Table 1) and to time periods when more than 1 bird could be expected according to the long term ringing data ( Table 2 ). The four mornings with the largest ringing totals of the 1998 season ( Fig. 1 ; 24 Aug, 12 Sept, 17 Sept and 24 Oct) were not included in this analysis since migration increased only in the second half of the night and was most intense after the beginning of civil twilight at dawn, when IR observations had already ceased (see below).

The sum of these mornings corresponds to 20 % of caught nocturnal migrants during the observation period.

The nocturnal pattern of migratory intensity recorded with IR during these nights was first moderate and increased towards morning (Fig. 3) . This is very different from the average nightly pattern observed for the rest of the season, which showed peak intensity approximately two to three hours after the end of civil twilight at dusk (third tenth of the night) and declining intensity towards dawn. The differences of expected and observed ringing numbers per species correlated significantly with the migratory intensity (log[mean MTR]) in all pre-Saharan migrants considered, i. e. Robin, Goldcrest, Wren and Song Thrush (Table 2 ). Figure 4 illustrates the results for the Robin. For the trans-Saharan migrants the result was only significant for the Chiffchaff and the Pied Flycatcher.

His results indicated no relation between ringing totals and migratory volume at Falsterbo. His conclusion was, however, based on data stemming (a) from surveillance radar incapable of detecting low-flying birds and (b) from a Falsterbo trapping system which at that time had not yet been standar-dised. The present study has the advantage of more reliable data emanating from the IR and from a standardised trapping system, both of which were applied in close proximity to one another and over a large part of the migration season, a time when at Falsterbo the numbers of resident and resting birds are negligible.",

Hence, to reach a conclusion about the actual composition of birds aloft based on trapping data is difficult. Nevertheless, our study gives at least some evidence for a direct correlation between the species composition of free-flying birds and that of birds landing in the nets. Zehnder et al. (in press) showed that the intensity of nocturnal bird migration at Falsterbo is higher with light tailwinds, and high and rising air pressure. Assuming that the same weather conditions influenced the trapping numbers, we can conclude that the decision of pre-Saharan migrants to engage in a migratory flight is influenced more strongly by the prevailing weather than is that of trans-Saharan species. In general, pre-Saharan migrants initiate their migratory journey later in the season when good migratory conditions are less frequent than in the time period at which trans-Saharan migrants leave. Therefore, in the latter group, the selection of favourable weather conditions and hence risk minimisation may have a stronger bearing on the process of natural selection. For trans-Saharan migrants, our results suggest that additional factors influence the decision of the birds to engage in a migratory flight. Possibly, the migratory urge is regulated more directly by endogenous factors which might be related to the much longer distance to their wintering grounds (cf. Berthold & Dorka 1969) .",

Our disparate findings for pre-and trans-Saharan migrants might indicate that the pre-Saharan migrants are more apt to interrupt their flight. Whereas for species wintering in central or southern Europe the Baltic sea is a major ecological barrier which they face on their journey, species migrating to tropical Africa are confronted with much larger obstacles, such as the Mediterranean Sea or the Sahara.",

In the case of the Sedge Warbler, however, reasons other than statistical shortcomings must be responsible for the missing relationship. In 1998 considerably fewer Sedge Warblers (29 % of the total) were caught in the period (21 Aug-10 Sept) when the migratory peak (44 % of the total) was expected according to long term ringing data. Possibly, this is a result of the very special wind conditions when many of them were under way. From 21-31 August there were continuous strong westerly winds at the time of the passage of mainly south-west Scandinavian Sedge Warblers (as indicated by retrapped birds ringed elsewhere, unpublished data, L. Karlsson) causing them to drift away from Falsterbo or not to migrate at all. This was followed by a period of strong easterly winds during the first ten days of September. According to retraps of birds ringed elsewhere Sedge Warblers from northern Sweden and Finland pass Falsterbo during September (unpublished data, L. Karlsson). Therefore these populations may have occurred in higher numbers than normal, drifted westwards by the winds. Food availability is another possible explanation of the Sedge Warbler's migratory pattern in 1998. Sedge Warblers feed mainly on aphids, a superabundant but patchily distributed prey (Bibby & Green 1981) . Consequently, Sedge Warblers present higher fat deposition rates and engage in long-distance flights once they achieve a sufficient fat load (Schaub & Jenni 2000) . If places situated north of Falsterbo offered good stopover conditions during their main migratory period, the Sedge Warblers simply passed Falsterbo without stopping over to a greater extent than normal.",

Bruderer & Liechti 1990 ). Nevertheless, some bird species follow exclusively south-eastern routes. The migratory directions of other species are split into southwest and south-east cohorts, which complicates the classification of some Scandinavian populations as SW or SE migrants (e. g. Blackcaps). However, the predominance of SW migrants is reflected in the main migratory flight direction towards the SSW as registered by IR. South-easterly flight directions observed by IR were more frequent than expected from the proportion of SE migrants captured at Falsterbo. Alerstam (1975) observed by radar an intense SE migration of Redwings, a diurnal migrant wintering in south-west Europe, over southern Sweden. Westerly winds prevailed during ours and Alerstam's study. Flight directions are determined endogenously and are modified, among other things, by wind. Zehnder et al. (in press) showed that high flying birds do not compensate for wind drift. Therefore, we conclude that south-westerly winds caused a shift of flight directions towards the E for which the birds presumably compensate later. As a consequence, it is not possible to deduce from the actual flight direc-S. Zehnder & L.
