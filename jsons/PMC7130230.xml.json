The delivery system must be restricted in such a way as to leave the normal cells unaffected by any detrimental affects of bystander cell transduction. Targeting may be achieved by engineering the surface components of viruses and liposomes at the level of target cell recognition and/or by incorporating transcriptional elements in plasmid or viral genome [4]. In the enthusiasm to proceed to clinical trials, basic studies of disease pathophysiology have not been given adequate attention. However, basic studies are essential since, when they are carried out in appropriate animal models, they can lead to alternative treatment strategies, a better understanding of target cells and an overall more effective design of a therapeutic approach. Studying the differences between human diseases and animal model phenotypes may lead into insights of disease pathogenesis that may be exploited either by gene therapy or pharmacological approaches. As additional genes leading to human diseases are isolated, gene targeting and transgenic technologies will generate more mouse models of human diseases and it is anticipated that an increasingly productive use of such models to elucidate disease pathophysiology will lead to more efficient gene therapy approaches.",

The broad applicability of PCR is due to the sensitivity that permits enzymatic amplification of gene fragments from minute quantities of nucleic acids derived from limited amounts of material. Aside from the diagnosis of infections, the PCR can be utilized in identifying parasites and their genetic characterization, the isolation and characterization of expressed genes and the detection of anthelmintic resistance [5]. The PCR is so sensitive that just a single virus, bacterium, parasite or cell is sufficient to be detected, provided part of its nucleic acid sequence is known. Since the nucleic acids are much more stable than enzymes or other proteins, the material does not need to be fresh or stored under special conditions. The PCR also tends to be quicker than immunodetection methods and has been standardized so it can be carried out in diagnostic laboratory [6].",

Using a biotinylated cDNA probe the assay was able to detect FIPV RNA, in particular cells infected with FIPV isolates.

All of the kittens developed signs of FIP and where then confirmed on a gross post mortem examination. The recombinant proteins induced no specific antibody response and failed to alter the course of the disease, but a week after the virus challenge the PBMCs showed small increases in the expression of a IL-6 and IFN gamma mRNA.

By using these MAbs to study the viral antigenic structure and functional characteristics of surface proteins it became possible to single out and map the functions of antigenic sites of surface glycoprotein E2. Mapping out these functions led to the detection of the relationship between RNAse activity and the structural component of another surface glycoprotein, E0 [15]. As it turns out the envelope glycoprotein E2 is the most immunogenic protein of classical swine fever virus (CSFV). The immune response induced by E2 protects pigs against CSFV and an indirect blocking ELISA, or a complex blocking assay (CTB) based on two independent structural antigenic units is routinely used worldwide for serological diagnosis of CSFV infections [16]. Studying MAbs by measuring the phenotypic changes in circulating leukocytes can also be implemented as a diagnosis indicator in CSFV infection. The pattern of phenotypic change varied with the virulence of CSFV. Infection with virulent strains resulted in the dramatic early loss of CD8-bearing T lymphocytes from the circulation [17].",

The mutation responsible for canine hemophilia B resulted in a complete lack of circulating factor IX in the affected animals. The observed mutation would have major adverse effects on the tertiary structure of the aberrant factor IX molecule. The elucidation of this mutation sheds light on structure-function relationship in factor IX and should facilitate future experiments directed toward gene therapy in this disease [23]. In a similar study, recombinant adenoassociated viral vectors (rAAV) containing the canine factor IX cDNA was infused into the livers of canine models of hemophilia B. When a dose of rAAV was administered to hemophilic dogs, results showed 1% of dogs with normal canine factor IX levels, the absence of inhibitors, and a sustained partial correction of the coagulation defect for at least 8 months [24].",

In another study, the antigen identified by MAb\u2019s was observed to be a well-conserved, highly expressed cell surface protein that was present during all phases of the cell cycle during malignant canine melanoma. This consistency in expression suggested that the antigen may be potentially useful to treat dogs with melanoma [29]. It was found that by treating metastatic melanoma in canine with tumor surgery, radiotherapy, and repeated local injections of xenogenic Vero cells relapse less frequently and survive longer than those dogs treated with surgery and radiotherapy alone. Xenogenic Vero cells were observed to secrete high levels of human IL-2, and be produced local to the tumor site which promoted a strong immune response leading to tumor growth inhibition or rejection [30].",
