Interestingly, it has recently been shown that patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia are more likely to suffer from viral infections, including rhinovirus, compared with healthy subjects, in spite of intravenous immunoglobulin replacement.16 The prevalence of asthma appears to be higher in patients with various immune deficiencies including hypogammaglobulinemia, with an estimated prevalence of 15% in the studies.17 The mechanism causing the increased prevalence of viral infections in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia is unknown. Secretory IgA deficiency in the bronchial mucosa has been suggested.16 To our knowledge, the link between viral infections and serum immunoglobulin in patients with asthma is poorly understood.",

The socioeconomic statuses of the patients are very close because both locations are managed in the same way by the French government. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 years or older and hospitalized for an asthma exacerbation. An exacerbation was defined as the increase in respiratory symptoms for more than 24 hours or the use of oral corticosteroid therapy. Asthma diagnoses were established on a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing associated with variable expiratory airflow limitation before hospitalization according to the Global Initiative for Asthma.1 Exclusion criteria were smoking more than 10 packs of cigarettes a year, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pregnancy. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de pneumologie de langue Fran\u00e7aise. Each patient gave an informed written consent to take part in the study.",

Other mechanisms beyond adaptive immunity dysfunction are involved in virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Indeed, an altered innate immune antiviral response has been observed in patients with asthma compared with those without asthma.38, 39, 40 Our study does not add a mechanistic explanation for the low level of serum IgG in patients with a positive virus sample.",

Indeed, patients with a hospitalization length of more than 3 days or a steroid course of more than 5 days show lower IgG concentrations at the time of exacerbation. Among patients with stable COPD, reduced total IgG levels have been linked to an increased risk of exacerbations and hospitalizations.41 In that study, patients with serum IgG level of less than 7 g/L had a higher risk of COPD exacerbations compared with patients with the highest quartile of serum IgG. We assessed the predictive ability of serum IgG concentrations as a biomarker of exacerbation severity. However, it does not seem to be a useful predictor based on modest sensitivity and poor specificity. If we combine serum IgG concentrations and a positive virus sample, the prediction of exacerbation severity was not improved, and further studies are needed to specifically assess IgG level as a marker of severity in asthma exacerbations. The prediction of next hospitalizations with IgG levels would also be interesting, but we cannot answer this question with our study because it was not designed to answer this question. However, we may speculate that a low IgG level particularly at baseline would predispose patients to virus infection and consequently increase their risk of hospitalization.",

The difference in IgG concentrations between patients with positive and negative viral samples is statistically significant, but it remains uncertain whether this difference is clinically relevant or not. More robust studies on the role of IgG are needed. In addition, the change in IgG concentrations or other immunoglobulins over time was not assessed in our study. We did not measure IgG in patients in a stable condition. It would have been interesting to know if the IgG decline is transient or longer-lasting. Indeed, in patients with COPD, low IgG serum concentrations at baseline seem to be associated with more severe exacerbations per year.41 However, in this study, no virus analysis was performed. Finally, our study is based on multiplex PCR for virus identification. Nevertheless, the list of viruses, though very extensive, is not exhaustive; therefore, emerging viruses cannot be ruled out.",

Further studies are requested to know the exact usefulness of IgG concentrations as a severity marker of severe asthma exacerbations.
