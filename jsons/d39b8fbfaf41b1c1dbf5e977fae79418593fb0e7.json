A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been shown to be the causative agent of SARS. The typical clinical feature associated with SARS is diffuse alveolar damage in lung, and lung fibrosis is evident in patients who died from this disease. The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV infection causes lung fibrosis are not fully understood, but transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-mediated lung fibrosis are among the most documented ones. The activation of the TGF-b/Smad pathway is critical to lung fibrosis. SARS-CoV infection not only enhances the expression of TGF-b, but also facilitates its signaling activity. The SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 is a negative regulator of lung fibrosis, and SARS-CoV infection decreases ACE2 expression. Therefore, SARS-CoV infection may lead to lung fibrosis through multiple signaling pathways and TGF-b activation is one of the major contributors.",

At 1-2 weeks after the onset of the disease, the majority of patients can recover but one-third of patients develop severe symptoms. Many patients in the latter group deteriorate into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with high mortality. During the convalescence, patients gradually shed virus but this process may take a long time. However, no chronic infection by SARS-CoV has been documented in humans.

The mechanism of DAD is believed to be endothelial and alveolar epithelial injury due to both direct viral effects and other indirect factors . During the early phase of SARS development (7-10 days), the lungs demonstrate the features of DAD including extensive edema, hyaline membrane formation, fluid and cellular exudation, collapse of alveoli, and desquamation of alveolar epithelial cells. At the same time, fibrous tissue could be detected in alveolar spaces. This phase is referred as the acute stage. In the medium phase of SARS development (10-14 days), the lungs display fibrous organization including interstitial and airspace fibrosis, reparative fibroblastic proliferation and type II pneumocytic hyperplasia. The fibrous organization becomes more extensive with time. This phase is referred as the proliferative organizing stage. In the late phase of SARS (2-3 weeks), referred as the fibrotic stage, the lungs exhibit dense septal and alveolar fibrosis. The time duration is counted from onset of the symptoms, and the pathological process does not always evolve through all the three stages, but may cease or recover at any phase Cheung et al. 2004; Gu and Korteweg 2007; Guo et al. 2008; Ketai et al. 2006; Ng et al. 2006; Nicholls et al. 2003; Tse et al. 2004) .",

Clinical data showed that fibrous organization is more common in patients in the late phase than in patients in the early or medium phases. In contrast, DAD more likely happens in patients in the early or medium phases than in patients in the late phase. Thus lung fibrosis can also display without DAD (Hwang et al. 2005) . Importantly, lung fibrosis was even observed in SARS patients who had recovered and been discharged from hospital. Furthermore, the prevalence rate of lung fibrosis in cured SARS patients at 9 months after discharge is about 21% (42/200). The traditional therapy for lung fibrosis (glucocorticoid and hormone treatment) has no effect on the SARS-induced lung fibrosis regardless of the dosage, method, or length of drug usage. Interestingly, individuals who had lung fibrosis showed some spontaneous recovery (Xie et al. 2005) .",

Lung fibrosis is characterized by failed alveolar re-epithelialization, fibroblast persistence, and excessive deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix (ECM) components as well as destruction of the normal lung architecture (Sime and O'Reilly 2001) . Progression of lung fibrosis results in the widening of interstitial matrix, eventual compression and destruction of normal lung parenchyma, and resultant damage to the capillaries leading to ventilatory insufficiency (Razzaque and Taguchi 2003) . The etiology of lung fibrosis is uncertain: smoking, viral infection, drug exposure, and genetic predisposition may contribute to the fibrotic process. Chronic inflammation was regarded as the main reason for lung fibrosis and it can result in epithelial injury and fibroblast activation. However, recent studies have suggested that alveolar epithelial injury and formation of active myofibroblast foci are the main reasons for most lung fibrotic processes (Chapman 2004; Gharaee-Kermani et al. 2007; Kalluri and Neilson 2003; Razzaque and Taguchi 2003; Scotton and Chambers 2007) .",

Type II alveolar epithelial cells are one of the major sources of these fibrogenic factors. These factors in turn stimulate hyperproliferation of type II alveolar epithelial cells, recruit fibroblasts to the fibrotic loci, and induce transdifferentiation/activation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. The myofibroblasts are responsible for the excessive accumulation of ECM in the basement membranes and interstitial tissues, which finally leads to the loss of alveolar function, especially gas exchange between alveoli and capillaries (Razzaque and Taguchi 2003) .",

The expression and deposition of collagen are the major events of ECM accumulation. Various types of collagens, such as type I, type III, and type VI, have been found in fibrotic lesions of the lungs. Many factors are involved in the ECM degradation, amongst which the plasminogen activator/plasmin system plays an important role. The activity of plasminogen is regulated by a physiologic inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1). In fibrotic lungs of patients, PAI-1 expression is increased. The deletion of the PAI-1 gene can reduce the susceptibility of mouse to lung fibrosis induced by various stimuli whereas PAI-1 protein overexpression enhances it, indicating that PAI-1 is critical in the development of lung fibrosis (Izuhara et al. 2008 ). In addition to plasminogen, other proteolytic enzymes including matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain (ADAM) also contribute to ECM degradation. The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP) accelerate EMC deposition by neutralizing MMP activities (Gill and Parks 2008) . In fibrotic lungs of patients, a wider distribution of TIMP compared with MMP has been described, suggesting that in lung fibrosis the total ECM degradation is reduced (Gill and Parks 2008; Izuhara et al. 2008; Liu 2008; Razzaque and Taguchi 2003) .",

TGF-b signaling is initiated via its binding to the transmembrane receptors (Heldin et al. 1997; Hu et al. 2006; Massague and Chen 2000; Shi and Massague 2003) . Ligand binding results in the formation of heterocomplexes between type I and type II receptors, in which the type II receptor phosphorylates and activates the type I receptor. The activated type I receptor then phoshorylates downstream signaling mediators -R-Smad proteins -which form a heteromeric complex with common Smad-Smad4 and are accumulated in the nucleus to orchestrate the expression of target genes in collaboration with other DNA-binding factors or transcription cofactors. In addition to the canonical Smad pathway, TGF-b has been reported to activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK, p38 and JNK), phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt, p21-activated kinase (PAK), and others (Derynck and Akhurst 2007; Moustakas and Heldin 2005) .",

Myofibroblasts localize to fibrotic foci and other sites of active fibrosis, and contribute to most ECM production. TGF-b can directly promote resident lung fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts. Furthermore, TGF-b induces the epithelial cells to undergo transition to form fibroblasts and hence myofibroblasts, a process termed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Derynck and Akhurst 2007) . It has been shown that alveolar epithelial cells can undergo EMT in response to TGF-b both in vitro and in animal models (Kim et al. 2006; Willis et al. 2005) . In biopsy samples, both epithelial and mesenchymal markers were found to be coexpressed in a cell, suggesting the existence of the EMT state in fibrotic lungs (Burkett et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2006; Willis et al. 2005; Wu et al. 2007 ).

The SARS-CoV N protein is a 46 kDa viral RNA-binding protein and shares little homology with the counterparts of other known coronaviruses (He et al. 2004 ). Our recent study demonstrated that N protein can associate with Smad3 and interferes with the formation of the complex between Smad3 and Smad4 (Zhao et al. 2008) . However, N protein has no effect either on TGF-bstimulated phosphorylation or on the nuclear accumulation of Smad3. Furthermore, it could promote the interaction between Smad3 and the transcriptional coactivator p300 to activate downstream genes. In lung epithelial and fibroblast cells, overexpressing N protein enhances the TGF-b-induced expression of PAI-1 and collagen I, and this enhancement is independent of Smad4. Interestingly, N protein attenuates Smad4-dependent apoptosis, which is in agreement with the fact that N protein was not found in the apoptotic cells (Zhao et al. 2008) . Thus, SARS-CoV can promote the lung fibrosis process through its N protein.",

            "text": "It is suggested that ACE2 protects against lung fibrosis through negative regulation of the local ANG-II level. In addition to its role in vasoconstriction regulation, ANG-II also contributes to many fibrotic diseases including lung, renal, hepatic, and cardiac fibrosis (Watanabe et al. 2005) . ANG-II is mainly produced by fibroblasts, as well as activated macrophages. ANG-II signals via two receptors AGTR1 and AGTR2. ANG-II could stimulate the production and secretion of TGF-b cytokine in lung tissue, and this process may be mediated by AGTR1 (Molteni et al. 2007 ). As TGF-b itself can also regulate the level of ANG-II, it is believed that an \"autocrine loop\" between ANG-II and TGF-b exists in lung tissue. Therefore, both ACE inhibitor and AGTR antagonist can block lung fibrosis in experimental animals (Uhal et al. 2007) . In a mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, the antagonist of angiotensin II receptor reduces the lung fibrosis score. This effect is accompanied with a reduction of the TGF-b level (Otsuka et al. 2004; Waseda et al. 2008) .",

The spike protein of SARS-CoV could bind to ACE2 on the cell surface, and this binding promotes viral entry into the cell and induces cell-cell fusion into multinucleated cells (syncytia formation) . ACE2 proteins are expressed by alveolar epithelial cells, the primary targets of SARS-CoV in lung. Thus, ACE2 contributes to SARS disease both as protector of lung fibrosis and as the cellular receptor for viral infection . Interestingly, SARS-CoV infection and the spike protein of SARS-CoV reduce ACE2 expression level during viral infection ). As discussed above, the decreased ACE2 expression results in an increased ANG-II level and leads to lung fibrosis and lung failure. Accordingly, the in-vivo administration of the spike protein did not affect the severity of lung failure in Ace2 knockout mice . Furthermore, administration of spike protein to mice led to a significant increase in ANG-II level in the lung tissue. Inhibition of ANG-II receptor can rescue the effect of the spike protein (Imai et al. 2007; Kuba et al. 2005) . Altogether, infection with SARS-CoV results in ACE2 downregulation through the binding of SARS-CoV spike protein to ACE2, and this spike protein-mediated ACE2 downregulation is responsible for the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis by upregulating ANG-II and activating TGF-b signaling.",

In patients with lung fibrosis, the MCP-1 level is usually upregulated (Emad and Emad 2007; Wynn 2008) . SARS-CoV infection upregulates the MCP-1 level in patients. The elevation of the MCP-1 level happens at least 2 weeks after disease onset. Corticosteroid treatment reduces MCP-1 concentrations at 5-8 days after treatment . MAPK p38 is a signal transducer that responds to extracellular stimulation including viral infection, and in turn regulates cell differentiation and ECM production. Hyperactivation of p38 was detected in patients of lung fibrosis, and phosphorylation of p38 is responsible for pulmonary myofibroblast activation and a-SMA expression (Hu et al. 2006; Yoshida et al. 2002) . SARS-CoV infection has been reported to induce p38 phosphorylation in lung epithelial and other cells, which lead to actin reorganization (Mizutani et al. 2006; Surjit et al. 2004 ).

However, the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV infection leads to lung fibrosis remain poorly understood. We have discussed two important mechanisms for SARS-mediated fibrosis: activation of TGF-b signaling and degradation of ACE2 ( Fig. 15.1) . A major challenge will be how to use what we have learned to prevent SARS-CoV-evoked lung fibrosis. The decreased ACE2 expression leads to a high ANG-II level, which further enhances the TGF-b level. TGF-b activates Smad proteins via receptor-mediated phosphorylation and stimulates Smad-dependent gene transcription, which is facilitated by N protein of SARS-CoV and ANG-II. Both the TGF-b/Smad and the ACE2/ANG-II/CTGF pathways contribute to myofibroblast activation and ECM accumulation, collectively leading to the final lung fibrosis",
