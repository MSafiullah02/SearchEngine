Causes include abruptio placentae, placenta previa, placenta accreta/increta/percreta, and uterine rupture. Abruptio placentae (placental abruption) involves separation of the placenta from the decidua basalis prior to delivery. The patient may present with pain, vaginal bleeding, uterine tenderness, and increased uterine activity. Fetal heart rate abnormalities may be encountered. Depending on the location of bleeding, considerable blood loss may occur prior to diagnosis. Significant hemorrhage is associated with coagulopathy. Placenta previa involves implantation of the placenta in the lower part of the uterus and often is associated with a previous Cesarean section (CS) scar. Placenta accreta is an abnormally adherent placenta that implants in the uterine wall, usually in scar tissue following previous CS. With increasing severity there is placenta increta - invasion of the myometrium and placenta percreta - in which the placenta invades the extra-uterine pelvic tissues. Uterine rupture during labor is another potential complication and is infrequently associated with previous CS.",

PPH is the most frequent indication for ICU admission. In 60% to 70% of cases, the cause of PPH is failure of uterine contraction following delivery. This uterine atony results in continuous bleeding that is often painless. Placental retention is the second most common cause of PPH (20% to 30% of cases). Genital trauma results in approximately 10% of cases of PPH and usually is associated with laceration of the vagina/cervix following instrumental delivery. Coagulation disorders may also result in PPH. These may be congenital - hemophilia or von Willebrand disease - or acquired: sepsis, amniotic fluid embolus (AFE) syndrome, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, pre-eclampsia, or HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome.",

Initial management depends on the cause of the hemorrhage and whether delivery of the fetus has occurred. Where the hemorrhage occurs postpartum, uterine atony with or without retained products should be suspected. Oxytocin should be administered, the bladder should be emptied, and the uterus massaged. Intravenous access is obtained, blood is sent for crossmatching, and if cross-matched blood is unavailable, O negative blood is obtained. The obstetrician should examine the genital tract for evidence of trauma. If bleeding persists, prostaglandin therapy - either intravenous prostaglandin E2 or 15-methyl prostaglandin F2\u03b1 - is administered. Consideration should be given to uterine tamponade, by packing or balloon compression. Continued bleeding should result in surgical intervention: arterial ligation, B-Lynch suture, Cesarean hysterectomy, or uterine artery embolization [4]. It is important that these interventions occur without delay; with each advancing minute, continued blood loss leads to loss of clotting factors, coagulopathy, and the potential for exsanguination. It is imperative that the patient be kept warm and that blood products and fluids be warmed through a rapid transfusion device. An arterial line should be placed to measure blood pressure and pulse pressure variability and to take blood samples to track hematocrit and acid-base status. Ideally, qualitative tests of clot quality (for example, thromboelastography) would be combined with coagulation studies to guide blood component resuscitation. In the event of uncontrolled non-surgical bleeding, consideration should be given to the administration of recombinant factor VIIa (90 \u03bcg/kg, repeated at 20 minutes if there is no response) [5-7].",

Failure of the second phase of trophoblast invasion results in the lack of destruction of the muscularis layer of the spiral arterioles, impairing vasodilation in response to increases in blood flow, resulting in placental ischemia. The ischemic placenta releases vasoactive substances, leading to systemic endothelial injury and systemic organ dysfunction. As pregnancy progresses, placenta ischemia worsens, and the mother becomes hypovolemic and hypertensive and may develop renal dysfunction. There is disordered prostaglandin metabolism, with an imbalance between vasoconstrictive thromboxane and vasodilatory prostacyclin, resulting in platelet dysfunction, endothelial damage, and further vasoconstriction.",

PET is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, for the mother and fetus. PET usually resolves following delivery of the fetus but may manifest postpartum. A variety of antihypertensive agents, including hydralazine, labetalol, sodium nitroprusside, alpha blockers, calcium channel blockers, and methyl dopa, have been advocated in PET. Hydralazine and labetalol are the most widely used of these in the critical care setting. Hydralazine is administered by slow intravenous injection: first with 5 mg intravenously and repeated at 20-minute intervals (5 to 10 mg depending on the response). Once blood pressure control is achieved, hydralazine can be repeated as needed (usually about every 3 hours). Labetolol is started at 20 mg intravenously as a bolus, and the dose is doubled every 10 minutes until blood pressure is under control. The maximum dose is 220 mg. Magnesium is usually co-administered to provide vasodilatation and prevent seizures. Care should be taken with fluid resuscitation because of the risk of pulmonary edema.",

Seizures tend to be self-limiting, and status epilepticus is unusual. Magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) is superior to phenytoin and benzodiazepines in the prevention of recurrent eclamptic seizures [8]. Magnesium toxicity is rare in the absence of renal failure. Respiratory arrest caused by magnesium toxicity can be reversed with calcium. While traditionally the mortality from eclampsia has been high, death is now uncommon, and much of the mortality is attributable to hepatic complications, including hepatic failure, hemorrhage, or infarction [9].",

The majority of patients are diagnosed before 37 weeks of gestation. There is a clear overlap between PET and HELLP syndrome, and it is unclear whether the latter is a primary or secondary disease process. The syndrome is believed to be due to generalized endothelial and microvascular injury from activation of the complement and coagulation cascades, increased vascular tone, and platelet aggregation. This results in areas of hemorrhage and necrosis within the liver and may evolve to large hematomas, capsular tears, and intraperitoneal bleeding. Laboratory criteria for this syndrome include microangiopathic hemolysis with schistocytes present on the peripheral blood smear, platelet count of fewer than 50,000/mm3, serum total bilirubin of more than 20 \u03bcmol/L (1.2 mg/100 mL), serum lactate dehydrogenase of more than 600 U/L, and serum aspartate transaminase of more than 70 U/L.",

HELLP syndrome is a medical emergency and the mother's blood pressure and coagulation status must be stabilized rapidly. Corticosteroids should be administered to the mother to advance the lung maturity of the fetus if the gestation age is below 34 weeks. In the majority of cases, liver, renal, and hematopoietic function normalizes after 5 days. In about 30% of cases, HELLP syndrome will develop in the postpartum period. Dexamethasone does not benefit the mother with HELLP syndrome [10]. Delivery of the fetus can significantly abrogate HELLP syndrome.

Without early diagnosis and treatment (fetal delivery), the patient may develop acute liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy. It is more common in primiparas, in twin pregnancies, and in patients who have pre-eclampsia. AFLP is a mitochondrial disorder [11] related to inherited mutations that cause a deficiency of the long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (LCHAD), a fatty acid beta-oxidation enzyme. When a heterozygous mother has a fetus that is homozygous for these mutations, the fetus is unable to metabolize long-chain fatty acids; these acids accumulate in the fetus and spill over into the maternal circulation [12]. This mutant gene and deficient coenzyme product leads to accumulation of long-chain fatty acid metabolites that are hepatotoxic [13].",

However, an anaphylactoid or hypersensitivity reaction to the contents of this fluid is more likely [17]. The presence of amniotic fluid in the pulmonary circulation is neither sensitive nor specific, as this has been identified in mothers who do not develop AFE syndrome. Patients may present with seizure-type activity or acute respiratory distress. Acute lung injury results in profound hypoxemia, intense hypoxic pulmonary vaso-constriction, and acute right heart failure (Table 4), resulting in hemodynamic collapse. Bowing of the right ventricle into the left results in acute diastolic and then acute systolic failure of the left ventricle. There is simultaneous DIC that may manifest with bleeding from the placental bed. Nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion, and seizures commonly follow. Death from AFE syndrome results from multi-organ failure, exsanguinations, or cardiac arrest. Neurologic injury is common in survivors.",

In a high-risk peripartum patient (Table 4) or one who has recently undergone termination of pregnancy (with hypertonic saline), the combination of coagulopathy, ARDS, and shock should be considered AFE syndrome until otherwise proven. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, particularly due to chorioamniitis, thromboembolic pulmonary embolism, and aspiration pneumonitis. The fetus should be delivered emergently to avoid fetal demise. CS may be complicated by excess bleeding, requiring ligation of the uterine arteries and perhaps hysterectomy. There is no specific treatment, although both aprotinin and activated protein C, compounds that modulate inflammation and coagulation, may have some utility [18]. Critical care management should be directed at maintaining oxygen delivery and supporting the heart and circulation with inotropes and vasopressors. Early echocardiography is extremely useful to determine the nature of the cardiac injury (right versus left ventricular failure). Right ventricular failure can be worsened by high levels of positive end-expiratory pressure and vasopressors and can be managed with milrinone, enoxamone, dobutamine, inhaled nitric oxide, and nebulized prostacyclin. Very large quantities of blood products may be required to control the coagulopathy, and this can result in significant fluid overload. Early consideration should be given to continuous renal replacement therapy. Although extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may appear to be an ideal approach to cardiopulmonary failure, excess bleeding may limit its application [19].",
