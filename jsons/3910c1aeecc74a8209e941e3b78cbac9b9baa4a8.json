            "text": "The virus-specific RNAs in feline calicivirus (FCV) infected cells were examined to determine the number and forms of RNAs that are synthesized during the infection process. Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA from 5-h infected cells probed with a cDNA clone derived from the 3' end of the FCV genome (pCV3) revealed four FCV-specific RNAs that were approximately 8.2 (genomic RNA), 4.8, 4.2 and 2.4 kb in length. Northern blots of poly(A)+ RNA purified from infected cells hourly after infection and probed with pCV3 demonstrated that transcription of all FCV-specific RNAs are detectable at 2 to 3 h post-infection (PI) and that these RNAs reached steady state levels at approximately 4 h PI. The levels of the FCV RNAs then remained relatively constant through 7 h PI, the last time tested, with the exception of the 4.8 and 4.2 kb transcripts which showed a marked increase between 6 and 7 hours PI. Northern blots of dsRNA which had been LiClfractionated from pooled total cellular RNA isolated from 5-h and 7-h FCV infected cells, showed two double-stranded RNAs corresponding to the 8.2 kb genomic RNA and the 2.4 kb subgenomic RNA. Preliminary mapping by Northern blotting using cDNA probes derived from varying locations within the FCV genome was done to determine the approximate regions from which the subgenomic RNAs are derived. This analysis indicates that the viral RNAs are nested, co-terminal transcripts with common 3' ends.",

            "text": "In characterizations of viral-specific RNAs in calicivirus-infected cells, Ehresmann and Schaffer (1977) demonstrated that there are two calicivirus-specific transcripts in infected cells. Their work involved labeling experiments with FCV, SMSV and VEV-infected cells using [3H] uridine in the presence of actinomycin D and subsequent analysis by glycerol gradient centrifugation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The largest RNA corresponded to the viral genornic RNA (36 S or approximately 2.6 X lo6 daltons) and the other to a subgenomic RNA of approximately 1.1 x lo6 daltons (22 S). They also demonstrated that approximately one-third of the viral RNA which sedimented at 18-22 S, was RNase resistant. This was shown to be the same size as the genomic RNA by analysis of the RNA on denaturing gradients and comparison to similarly treated 36 S RNA. Further work in characterization of the RNase-resistant population of RNAs which sedimented at 18-22 S showed that there were two double-stranded RNA species present, one of which corresponded to the genomic RNA and one to the 22 S subgenomic RNA (Ehresmann and Schaffer, 1979) . Black et al. (1978) in similar experiments with VEV demonstrated the presence of the 36 S, 22 S and an 18 S RNA. In addition, the 18 S RNA was shown to be RNase-sensitive, suggesting that it could be functioning as message in the infected cell. They also noted the presence of a small amount of RNase-resistant RNA which also sedimented at 18 S. This, in concurrence with Ehresmann and Schaffer (1977) , was considered to be double-stranded replicative form RNA.",

Probing with pCV3 produced the characteristic 4 bands corresponding to the four FCV RNAs (Fig. 2) , while probing with pCV6 resulted in the loss of signal from the 2.4 kb transcript (Fig. 5a) . This result demonstrates that the 2.4 kb transcript is derived from within the 3' 3000 bases of the FCV genome. Figure 5b illustrates the results obtained by probing with pCV9. The genomic RNA is present as is the 4.8 kb transcript. The 4.8 kb transcript is not clearly visible in Fig. 5b but is visible on the original autoradiograph. This indicates that there is only a small region of homology between this transcript and the FCV sequences contained in pCV9.

This broad middle band probably corresponds to the 4.2 and 4.8 kb transcripts observed by Northern blot hybridization, which yield a low hybridization signal. The low hybridization signal is probably due to lower copy number of these transcripts whether it be from lower stability, lower rate of transcription or both. The strength of the hybridization signal is probably not a good indicator of transcript copy number as it is probable that the larger transcripts, especially the genomic RNA, will not blot as efficiently as the 2.4 kb transcript.",

            "text": "The determine whether the subgenomic RNAs are transcribed uniformly throughout the infection process, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated at hourly intervals post-infection, Northern blotted and probed with pCV3. The four FCV transcripts were observed at 3 h PI, reached steady state levels at 4 h and remained constant until the last time period assayed, 7 h PI (Fig. 3) . The exception to this is the 4.2 and 4.8 kb transcripts which showed a large increase in hybridization signal between 6 and 7 h PI. The reason for this is unclear. Two lines of evidence suggest that this is not a late function RNA; (1) these RNAs appear with, and increase in proportion to, the other viral transcripts until 7 h PI at which time the cells are no longer attached to the culture bottle and (2) it has been demonstrated that intracellular virus could be detected by 3 h PI (Studdert et al., 1970) , suggesting that all functions necessary for viral replication and assembly are present early in infection. The 8.2 kb genomic RNA appears to be present at roughly the same copy number from 4 h until 7 h PI. This would seem to indicate that the viral RNA is being synthesized at approximately the same rate that virus particles are maturing and being released from the cell. More detailed kinetic studies are needed to determine this. Ehresmann and Schaffer (1977) and Black et al. (1978) demonstrated that a population of viral RNA sedimenting at 18-22 S was resistant to degradation by RNase, indicating the presence of a double-stranded replicative form RNA. This population of RNA was presumed to be the replicative form RNA. Ehresmann and Schaffer also mentioned the detection of a second, smaller species of double-stranded RNA in addition to the genomic double-stranded RNA. In investigations to characterize this second double-stranded RNA, Ehresmann and Schaffer (1979) found that this 2 M LiCl-soluble RNA sedimented at 18 S and when denatured, exhibited properties identical to the 1.1 X lo6 dalton (22 S) subgenomic RNA. Investigations were done in this study to confirm the size and identities of these double-stranded RNAs and to determine if there are any other double-stranded RNAs present. The results of Northern blot analysis of LiCl fractionated RNA showed that there are two double-stranded RNAs present in FCV infected cells which correspond to the 8.2 kb genomic RNA and 2.4 kb subgenomic RNAs (Fig.  4) . This result suggests that the sequences contained in the 2.4 kb subgenomic RNA may be replicated as well as transcribed. This would allow for amplification of these sequences, indicating that they may be needed in larger amounts than can be produced by transcription alone. Fretz and Schaffer (1978) proposed that the capsid protein may be the translational product of the 22 S RNA. Thus, replication of this RNA as well as transcriptional production would allow this RNA to be present in higher copy number and allow a larger amount of the capsid protein to be synthesized. The 2.4 kb RNA is present in high copy number (Figs. 2 and 3 ) and the capsid protein is the most abundunt viral protein present in calicivirus infected cells (Black and Brown, 1977; Fretz and Schaffer, 1978) . However, it is yet to be shown that the 2.4 kb RNA is being replicated. In addition, there was no band detected which corresponded to the 4.2 or 4.8 kb transcripts. It is possible that these transcripts are actually specific degradation products of the genomic RNA, or it is also possible that these transcripts lack sequences necessary to be replicated, which seems unlikely as preliminary evidence indicates that they possess the same sequences as those present in the 2.4 kb RNA (Fig. 5) .",

It was found that the cDNA clone from the 3' end of the genome hybridized with all of the FCV transcripts. As the probes used were progressively more 5' within the genome, there was a progressive loss of hybridization signal from the 2.4 kb to the 4.8 kb transcripts (Fig. 5) . This demonstrates that the RNAs are co-terminal, nested sets of transcripts in which the transcript begins at specific points and then continues to the 3' end of the genome. This scheme of tr~s~~ption is similar to that employed by the coronaviruses and the togaviruses (Baric et al., 1987; Brayton et al., 1984; Ou et al., 1983) .

Poly(A)+ RNA from 5-h PI FCV-infected cells was fractionated by electrophoresis on a formaldehyde denaturing gel, blotted to nitrocellulose and probed with radiolabeled cDNA clones illustrated in Fig. 1B. (a) Probed with pCV6. (b) Probed with pCV9. (c) Probed with pCVl0. The characteristic four-band pattern obtained when probed with pCV3 is illustrated in Fig. 2. The sizes indicated are in kb.cDNA probe and that the 4.8 kb transcript originates within the sequences contained in pCV9. A diagram illustrating the results of this mapping is shown inFig. 6. The dots at the 5' end of the transcripts indicate the area where transcription",
