This finding suggests that the viral load patterns vary among different patients and that some patients have a more protracted and complex profile. When comparing these findings with ribavirin use, a decrease in the viral load was found in 4 cases (patients A, B, C, and F). However, viral load remained high despite 110 days of ribavirin therapy, in patients D, E, and H.

The temporal relationship between peak viral load and IL-6, as well as the subsequent development of maximum pulmonary infiltrates, the nadir lymphocyte count, and the peak LDH level, is summarized in figure 2 .

It has been reported that ribavirin cannot inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV in vitro [13] . Previously, Peiris et al. [7] examined the viral load pattern in 14 patients who received ribavirin and steroid therapy. Because the viral load was not analyzed with respect to the exact time course of therapy for each patient, the effect of ribavirin on viral load was not addressed. In this study, we examined the effect of ribavirin on viral load in vivo. Despite the small sample size studied, we closely monitored the viral load and ribavirin use in each patient. We report different profiles of viral load during the course of infection and that use of ribavirin does not result in reduction of viral load in \u223c40% of the patients studied. Whether ribavirin use is associated with the high mortality among patients with SARS requires further investigation. This is the first study investigating the temporal relationship of viral load, proinflammatory cytokines, and clinical progression. Although there was some variation in the cytokine profiles, our analysis revealed a common picture and indicated that the elevation of IL-6 and/or IL-8 levels subsequent to the peak of viral replication is involved in pulmonary progression ( figure  1) . Similarly, the occurrence of the nadir lymphocyte count and peak LDH level lagged behind the peak viral load and IL-6 level (figure 2). This suggests that an immune-mediated process is involved in lymphopenia and tissue damage in patients with SARS [14] . Of note, the nadir lymphocyte count seems to correlate with the peak viral load ( ), raising the possibility P p .084 of a direct effect of viral replication on lymphopenia. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis of a viral replication phase followed by an immune response phase in the pathogenesis of SARS. Moreover, these findings provide important information on therapeutic strategies for SARS, including antivirals and immune-based regimens, such as steroids, IVIG, and convalescent-phase serum infusions. With regard to convalescent-phase serum infusions, we also examined IgG seroconversion in these 8 patients by an indirect immunofluorescence assay described elsewhere [15] . As shown in figure 1 , seroconversion correlated with the decrease in viral load in most cases. However, a delay in the decrease of viral load was found in patients E and F, and the viral load remained high in patients D and H in the presence of antibody. Although a study preliminarily suggested the efficacy of convalescentphase serum infusions [16] , our observation suggests that development of antibody may not correlate with clearance of virus, which should be taken into consideration before using convalescent-phase serum infusions as a therapeutic strategy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 100, "end": 104, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 133, "end": 136, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1505, "end": 1509, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2203, "end": 2207, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2557, "end": 2561, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1243, "end": 1253, "text": "figure  1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2222, "end": 2230, "text": "figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": ""}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Summary of probable SARS cases with onset of illness from 1", "authors": [], "year": 2002, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["S"], "last": "Peiris", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": ["Y"], "last": "Yuen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Osterhaus", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Stohr", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "N Engl J Med", "volume": "349", "issn": "", "pages": "2431--2472", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "A novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome", "authors": [{"first": "T", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Ksiazek", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Erdman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Goldsmith", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "N Engl J Med", "volume": "348", "issn": "", "pages": "1953--66", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Identification of a novel coronavirus in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Drosten", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Gunther", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "W", "middle": [], "last": "Preiser", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "N Engl J Med", "volume": "348", "issn": "", "pages": "1967--76", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "A major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Hong Kong", "authors": [{"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Lee", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Hui", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Wu", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "N Engl J Med", "volume": "348", "issn": "", "pages": "1986--94", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Clinical features and short-term outcomes of 144 patients with SARS in greater Toronto area", "authors": [{"first": "C", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Booth", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Matukas", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Tomlinson", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "JAMA", "volume": "289", "issn": "", "pages": "2801--2810", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Clinical progression and viral load in a community outbreak of coronavirus-associated SARS pneumonia: a prospective study", "authors": [{"first": "Jsm", "middle": [], "last": "Peiris", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Chu", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Vcc", "middle": [], "last": "Cheng", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Lancet", "volume": "361", "issn": "", "pages": "1767--72", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Lung pathology of fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Nicholls", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Llm", "middle": [], "last": "Poon", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Lee", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2003, "venue": "Lancet", "volume": "361", "issn": "", "pages": "1773--1781", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "Detection of large amount of SARSassociated coronavirus in throat wash and saliva: implications for transmission and early diagnosis", "authors": [{"first": "W", "middle": ["K"], "last": "Wang", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "S", "middle": ["Y"], "last": "Chen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "I", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Liu", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "Emerg Infect Dis", "volume": "10", "issn": "", "pages": "1213--1222", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF9": {"ref_id": "b9", "title": "World Health Organization.
