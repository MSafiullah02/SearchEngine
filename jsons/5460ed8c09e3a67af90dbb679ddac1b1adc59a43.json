Epidemics refer to a disease that spreads rapidly and extensively by infection and affecting many individuals in an area at the same time. In this way, the most recent worrying epidemic was the Severe Acute Respiratoy Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Asia. Infectious disease accounts for 29 of 96 major causes of human morbidity and mortality listed by the World Health Organization and the World Bank, and 25% of global deaths (over 14 million deaths annually). Consequently, since the publication of the first modern mathematical epidemic models in the first years of XX century (see [6, 9] ), several mathematical models to study the dynamics of epidemics have been appeared in the literature.",

Other mathematical models are based on a particular type of discrete dynamical systems called cellular automata (see, for example [2, 5, 7, 10, 11] ). These simple models of computation eliminate the last mentioned shortcomings, and are specially suitable for computer simulations. Roughly speaking, cellular automata (CA for short) are a special type of finite state machines capable to simulate physical, biological or environmental complex phenomena. Consequently, several models based on such mathematical objects have been proposed to simulate growth processes, reaction-diffusion systems, selfreproduction models, epidemic models, forest fire spreading, image processing algorithms, cryptographic protocols, etc. (see, for example, [12, 13] ). Specifically, a two-dimensional CA is formed by a two-dimensional array of identical objects called cells which can be disposed in a rectangular, triangular or an hexagonal lattice (called cellular space). These cells are endowed with a state that changes in discrete steps of time according to a specific rule. As the CA evolves, the updated function (whose variables are the states of the neighbor cells) determines how local interactions can influence the global behaviour of the system.",

The model introduced in this paper deals with SIS epidemic diseases (for example the group of those responsible for the common cold), that is, the population is divided into susceptible individuals (S) and infected individuals (I). The susceptible individuals are those capable to contracting the disease whereas the infected individuals are those capable of spreading the disease. For a SIS model, infected individuals return to the susceptible class on recovery because the disease confers no immunity against reinfection. Moreover, some assumptions will be common to all models: (1) The disease is transmitted by contact between an infected individual and a susceptible individual; (2) There is no latent period for the disease, hence the disease is transmitted instantaneously upon contact; (3) All susceptible individuals are equally susceptible and all infected individuals are equally infectious; (4) The population under consideration is fixed in size. This means that no births or migration occurs, and no deaths are taken into account.",

Unfortunately, there are few models considering more than one invidual in each cell (see for example [5] ). We think that this new paradigm is more accurate than the other one in order to obtain more realistic simulations. The main advantage of the model presented in this paper over the model introduced in [5] is the use of graph tology and a more realistic transition function involving new parameters as the portion of susceptible individuals that moves from one cell to another one.",

The analysis of the model proposed in this paper seems to be in agreement with the results obtained for other mathematical models not based on discrete event systems, such as ODEs or PDEs. Future work aimed at designing a more complete CA-based epidemic model involving additional effects such as the population movement, virus mutation, etc. Furthermore, it is also interesting to consider non-constant connections factors and also the effect of migration between the cells must be considered.",
