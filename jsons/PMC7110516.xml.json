The causative agent of MERS has been confirmed to be a novel coronavirus (CoV), named MERS-CoV (van Boheemen et al, 2012, Zaki et al, 2012). CoVs are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with genome size of ~30 kb. They have the characteristic crown-shaped appearance on electron microscopic examination. CoVs are classified into four genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus (with four lineages), Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus (Woo et al., 2012). MERS-CoV belongs to lineage C of Betacoronavirus (Fig. 1\n) (van Boheemen et al., 2012).",

Adult dromedaries have almost 100% seropositivity against MERS-CoV while the virus is found mainly in dromedary calves (Alagaili et al, 2014, Wernery et al, 2015b). Camel-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV and subsequent human-to-human transmission result in MERS in human beings, many of whom develop severe lower respiratory tract infections, with renal failure in some cases (Arabi et al, 2014, Saad et al, 2014). In contrast to human infection, MERS-CoV causes no or mild disease in dromedaries. In this article, our current understanding of MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries is reviewed and the presence of other CoVs in dromedaries is also discussed.",

Since then, the virus has been isolated from both human beings and dromedaries. Although Vero cells are usually the cell line used in clinical laboratories, the virus can be propagated in a variety of human and non-human cell lines, which may have implications for its tissue tropism and the high fatality associated with MERS (Chan et al, 2013, Eckerle et al, 2014, Zhou et al, 2015).",

High levels of MERS-CoV antibodies have been observed in dromedaries in the Middle East and Africa (Reusken et al, 2013, Corman et al, 2014a, Hemida et al, 2014, Meyer et al, 2014, Muller et al, 2014, Mackay, Arden, 2015). Serological follow-up of dromedary dams and their calves has showed a typical pattern of juvenile infection. Maternal antibodies against MERS-CoV in dromedary calves generally disappear between 4 and 8 months of age, permitting infection to occur during the seronegative period (Alagaili et al, 2014, Bin et al, 2016); young infected dromedaries then develop antibodies that persist for a long time. However, in a few cases, MERS-CoV has been isolated at the age of 20 days or even at younger, indicating that maternal antibodies are not necessarily protective. So far, the specific source of infection for young dromedaries is not known, although it is likely to be from other dromedaries. Extensive investigations in other animal species, including rodents, ticks, horses and small ruminants, have not demonstrated other reservoirs of infection to date.",

Preliminary data showed a significant reduction in excretion of infectious virus and viral RNA in small numbers of vaccinated and challenged dromedaries compared to controls. Protection is correlated with the presence of serum neutralising antibodies against MERS-CoV. MVA-specific antibodies that cross-neutralise camelpox virus are another very important advantage of this vaccine, since outbreaks of camelpox still occur in dromedaries (Higgins et al., 1992). Another approach would be to add a MERS-CoV component to the already existing attenuated camelpox vaccine Ducapox. Since Ducapox has been used in the Middle East for many years, the acceptance of such a vaccine can be anticipated (Wernery et al., 2014). However, it is important for the success of a vaccine to adhere strictly to the exact time of vaccination, since the window of disappearance of maternal antibodies and appearance of antibodies as a result of infection is narrow.",

So far, no antibodies to MERS-CoV have been detected in South American camelids or in Bactrian camels (Chan et al, 2015, Mackay, Arden, 2015). It seems that infection of dromedaries with MERS-CoV is limited to Africa and the Middle East (Perera et al, 2013, Reusken et al, 2013, Corman et al, 2014a, Hemida et al, 2014, Meyer et al, 2014, Muller et al, 2014). Over 90% of all dromedaries investigated from this region possess antibodies to the virus, some of them at least for more than 30 years (Muller et al., 2014). MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries is not a new entity and only very few young animals (<1%) may develop nasal discharge without other clinical signs. This picture changes when dromedaries are experimentally infected through the intranasal route (Haagmans et al., 2016).",

Only young dromedaries with no or low maternal antibodies to MERS-CoV are susceptible to infection and the virus is shed only for 8 days (Wernery et al., 2015b). These young dromedaries are reared with their mothers for a year and have no or very little contact with human beings. Additionally, less than 1% of infected calves exhibit nasal discharge and therefore the quantity of virus excreted may be low. Another reason for the low transmission rate is likely to be the lack expression of the MERS-CoV receptor-dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in the human upper respiratory tract (Widagdo et al., 2016).

We speculate that the bovine CoV-like CoV, with limited sequence information, described previously (Crossley et al, 2010, Crossley et al, 2012), is probably DcCoV UAE-HKU23. Phylogenetic analysis shows that CoV UAE-HKU23 is closely related to other CoVs of the Betacoronavirus 1 species in betaCoV lineage A, of which bovine CoV and human CoV OC43 are members (Woo et al., 2014d). Recently, we successfully isolated DcCoV UAE-HKU23 using the human rectal tumour HRT-18G cell line and confirmed that it is different from the betaCoV in alpacas using bioinformatics approaches (Woo et al., 2016b). Although both MERS-CoV and DcCoV UAE-HKU23 are beta CoVs, there is minimal cross antigenicity between them, as shown by various serological tests (Woo et al., 2014d). Last year, another alphaCoV that has been found in alpacas was also discovered in nasal samples of dromedaries (Table 1). The camelid alphaCoV, together with MERS-CoV and DcCoV UAE-HKU23, were observed to be co-circulating in camels in Saudi Arabia (Sabir et al., 2016).",

These include three novel lineages (B, C and D) of betaCoVs and a novel CoV genus (Deltacoronavirus) in the Coronavirus family. In addition, two large human CoV epidemics have affected numerous countries globally. The number of publications on CoVs in PubMed search has doubled in the last 10 years and a model of CoV evolution has been built. Due to the high recombination rate in CoVs and its unique mechanism of replication, it is expected that more and more \u2018new\u2019 CoVs will be generated. Some of these CoVs may have the capability to jump from one species to another and some of these interspecies transmission events may result in further major epidemics in human beings and animals.",

Furthermore, West Nile virus has also been isolated from dromedaries (Joseph et al., 2016). Notably, shortly after the discovery of a novel genotype of hepatitis E virus in dromedaries in Dubai, the same virus was found in a human liver transplant recipient from the Middle East with chronic hepatitis E virus infection. The patient had the habit of regular consumption of camel meat and milk, suggesting that the virus may be transmitted from dromedaries to human beings (Lee et al., 2016). Both the transmission of MERS-CoV and hepatitis E virus from camels to human beings have shown that some viruses from dromedaries can be transmitted to human beings.",
