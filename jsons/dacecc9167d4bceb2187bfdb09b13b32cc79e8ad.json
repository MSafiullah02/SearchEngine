During the outbreak of SARS, taking the prescribed preventive measures appeared to be the only known means that could effectively mitigate the chance of contracting this potentially fatal disease.

For example, people often use their own behavior as an anchor to estimate the prevalence of the same behavior among others (Allport, 1924) . One such egocentric bias, which is often referred to as the false consensus bias (or false consensus effect), is the tendency for people to see their own behaviors as more popular than they are perceived by people who do not engage in such behaviors (Ross et al. , 1977) .

For example, compared to light drinkers, heavy drinkers see the way they drink as more common among their friends, coworkers, and the general public (Wild, 2002) .

As in Study 1, the false consensus effect was robust and consistent.

This may be attributable to the fact that whereas Study 1 was conducted during the SARS outbreak, Study 2 was conducted 2 weeks after the World Health Organization had removed Hong Kong from the infected area list. The success in controlling the spread of SARS in the community might have led the participants to believe that many people in the community had practiced the preventive measures. This belief might mitigate the uniqueness bias in Study 2. There are three possible reasons for the weak, non-significant pluralistic ignorance effect and actor-observer bias in Study 2. First, Hong Kong's success in controlling the spread of SARS might have created a positive bias in the participants' attribution bias. Indeed, selfprotection attributions for other practicers' preventive behaviors in Study 2 were discernibly lower than those in Study 1 (4.9 vs 5.53 for using serving spoons and chopsticks at meal times, and 5.36 vs 5.83 for avoiding sharing food and drink). This positive bias could have eliminated the pluralistic ignorance effect in Study 2. Second, as Hong Kong's situation had improved when Study 2 was conducted, the desirability of the preventive behaviors might have become lower. Thus, participants in Study 2 might not view reporting preventive behaviors to be a vehicle for self-enhancement. Third, the target group in the estimation task was changed from general Hong Kong people in Study 1 to Hong Kong secondary school students in Study 2. It is possible that the participants saw secondary school students (their ingroup) more positively than general Hong Kong people (Tajfel, 1981) This intergroup evaluative bias might also attenuate the pluralistic ignorance and actor-observer bias in Study 2.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1881, "end": 1895, "text": "(Tajfel, 1981)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In the two studies, we documented several social cognitive biases in the prevalence estimation and motive assessment of some SARS preventive behaviors.

First, people are susceptible to normative influence (Asch, 1951) , and perceived consensus is an important determinant of the likelihood of participating in social action (Sechrist & Stangor, 2001) . In estimating social consensus, people often use their own behaviors as estimation anchors. In the present research, this was the case among people who practiced preventive behaviors and those who did not. The biased belief of having strong consensual support for one's own behavioral pattern may insulate a person from persuasive attempts to change behaviors. Non-practicers of preventive behaviors might believe that their behavioral pattern is widely shared and acceptable in the community and, hence, might be less motivated to change their behaviors. In addition, if non-practicers perceive undesirable behaviors (not practicing preventive measures) to be widely shared, they may also underestimate the risks associated with such behaviors (Jemmott et al., 1986) . From this perspective, health professionals may want to consider including in public health education campaigns factual information on the prevalence of preventive behaviors, particularly when the prevalence rates of such behaviors are high. In fact, as shown in Table 1 , six of the nine recommended preventive behaviors listed in the government websites were practiced by more than of 50% of our participants (see Suls et al., 1988 ; for a similar argument).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 117, "end": 129, "text": "(Asch, 1951)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 236, "end": 262, "text": "(Sechrist & Stangor, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1010, "end": 1032, "text": "(Jemmott et al., 1986)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1451, "end": 1468, "text": "Suls et al., 1988", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1298, "end": 1305, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "General Discussion"}, {"text": "The pluralistic ignorance effect and the actor-observer bias observed in some preventive behaviors revealed a tint of social pessimism or even cynicism in the participants' perceptions of other people's health behavior.

The social reality that emerged from such perceptual styles might lead to heightened anxiety and distrust in collective effort. While heightened anxiety will add to the economic and psychological costs of SARS, distrust in the collective effort may make it costly to implement primary prevention programs that require coordinated effort.

Secondary school students might be different from common Hong Kong people because in school settings, preventive behaviors were more systematically regulated (students had to wear a face mask during classes during the SARS outbreak). Second, there were logistic difficulties in obtaining behavioral measures of the actual prevalence rates of the preventive behaviors. As such, we relied on participants' self-report. Third, as mentioned earlier, there are indications that the social cognitive biases we examined might have changed during the different periods of the epidemic in Hong Kong. Finally, although previous research suggested that the social cognitive biases we examined in the present research have implications for psychological and behavioral reactions to SARS, we did not collect the data that are necessary to establish these links.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "General Discussion"}, {"text": "Researchers in Singapore (Chang & Sivam, this issue of the Journal), Beijing (Gan et al. , this issue of the Journal) and Toronto of Canada (Ji et al., this issue of the Journal) have noted various biases in people's perception of the SARS outbreak in their own regions, which, in turn, influenced their practice of related preventive health behaviors. We also found that Hong Kong people possessed pervasiveness social cognitive biases that might be linked to their psychological and behavioral reactions to the SARS epidemic. We have also identified some interesting directions for further explorations of these phenomena. As research scientists, it is tempting to end this paper with recommendations for further extensions of the present research program, including (i) replication of the present studies with more representative community samples using systematic behavioral sampling techniques to establish actual prevalence rates of preventive behaviors; (ii) analysis of the temporal change in these biases at the different stages of the epidemic; and (iii) in-depth empirical analysis of the implications of these biases for behavioral and psychological reactions to SARS. Similar research strategies may also be applied to understand the social cognitive basis of people's psychological reactions to other diseases. However, out of humanitarian concerns, we would rather close this paper with the wish that these further studies would never have the opportunity to be carried out, and we pay tribute to the health professionals who contributed so much to fight and conquer SARS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 77, "end": 88, "text": "(Gan et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 140, "end": 151, "text": "(Ji et al.,",
