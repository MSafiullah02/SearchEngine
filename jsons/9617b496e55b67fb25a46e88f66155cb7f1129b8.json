            "text": "Background: Porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a newly emerging Coronavirus that was first identified in 2012 in Hong Kong, China. Since then, PDCoV has subsequently been reported worldwide, causing a high number of neonatal piglet deaths and significant economic losses to the swine industry. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a highly sensitive and specific method for the rapid diagnosis of PDCoV. Results: In the present study, a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic method using recombinase polymerase amplification combined with a lateral flow dipstick (LFD-RPA) was developed for rapid and visual detection of PDCoV. The system can be performed under a broad range of temperature conditions from 10 to 37\u00b0C, and the detection of PDCoV can be completed in 10 min at 37\u00b0C. The sensitivity of this assay was 10 times higher than that of conventional PCR with a lower detection limit of 1 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u00b5l of PDCoV. Meanwhile, the LFD-RPA assay specifically amplified PDCoV, while there was no cross-amplification with other swine-associated viruses, including Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Porcine kobuvirus (PKoV), Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and Seneca valley virus (SVV). The repeatability of the test results indicated that this assay had good repeatability. In addition, 68 clinical samples (48 fecal swab specimens and 20 intestinal specimens) were further tested by LFD-RPA and RT-PCR assay. The positive rate of LFD-RPA clinical samples was 26.47% higher than that of conventional PCR (23.53%). Conclusions: The LFD-RPA assay successfully detected PDCoV in less than 20 min in this study, providing a potentially valuable tool to improve molecular detection for PDCoV and to monitor the outbreak of PDCoV, especially in low-resource areas and laboratories.",

            "text": "Porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus and a member of the genus Deltacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae that causes diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and mortality in neonatal piglets [1] [2] [3] . The full genome of PDCoV is approximately 25.4 kb in length [2] and encodes genome arrangements in the following order: 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame 1a/b (ORF1a/b), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nonstructural protein 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid (N), nonstructural protein 7 (NS7), and 3\u2032 UTR [4] . PDCoV was first reported in pig feces collected in Hong Kong during the molecular surveillance for Coronavirus (CoVs) in avian and mammalian species in 2011 [2] . However, the first outbreak of PDCoV was announced in Ohio in 2014 [5] . Soon thereafter, PDCoV spread to several swineproducing states of the United States, causing mortality of 30~40% in neonatal pigs [6] . To date, PDCoV has been detected/ isolated in pigs across the world, including Canada [7] , South Korea [8] , China [9] , Thailand [10] , and Vietnam [11] . Additionally, PDCoV infection has become prevalent in pig farms around the world, which has caused enormous economic losses in multiple countries and remains a serious challenge to the swine industry [12, 13] . At present, PDCoV is often seen in coinfection with other viral diarrheal pathogens with very similar clinical symptoms, which makes it difficult to effectively diagnose [14] . Furthermore, there are no effective vaccines or treatments for PDCoV, and the mechanism of its pathogenesis is still largely unknown [15] . Therefore, it is essential to develop a rapid, simple and highly sensitive diagnostic method to improve the efficacy of current control programs.",

The RPA amplification product can be easily detected by lateral flow dipstick (LFD), where results are rapidly obtained in a visual read-out format [16] . Using this method, the products could be exponentially amplified in 30 min at a low and constant temperature, without the need for an initial denaturation step or the use of multiple primers [17, 18] . In recent years, LFD-RPA has been used for the diagnosis of many pathogens, including Borrelia burgdorferi [19] , Neospora caninum [20] , Mycobacterium tuberculosis [21] , Francisella tularensis [22] and Foot-andmouth disease virus [23] . In the present study, we developed a LFD-RPA diagnostic method that is simple, highly sensitive and specific for the rapid and visual detection of PDCoV in clinical fecal samples from pigs. This assay greatly reduces the time for detection and dependence on the experimental instrument and generates a potential improvement in the diagnosis of PDCoV.",

            "text": "The LFD-RPA assay is a rapid, highly sensitive and selective detection method, and the results are obtained in a visual read-out format, which has been explored for the detection of diverse pathogens [16] . In the current study, we developed a rapid and visual method of LFD-RPA for detecting PDCoV in clinical samples. It is much faster and more convenient than conventional RT-PCR. The LFD-RPA reaction can be accomplished in less than 20 min at 10-37\u00b0C without any expensive high precision instrumentation. This means that the reaction can operate efficiently at body temperature without the need for special equipment [24] . In addition, the detection limit of the LFD-RPA assay was 10 2 copies/\u03bcL, which was more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR (10 3 copies/\u03bcL). Likewise, Ma et al. [25] recently reported a detection limit as low as 10 2 copies/\u03bcL of PDCoV by a real-time reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay, whose sensitivity was the same as that of LFD-RPA developed in the present study. The specific validation test indicated that the method is useful for PDCoV detection, and there was no cross-reaction with the several reference swine viruses used in the study. Moreover, the repeatability assay demonstrated that LFD-RPA has good repeatability for detecting PDCoV. Subsequently, LFD-RPA was used to detect the clinical samples to evaluate the performance. The results showed that the positive detection rate of LFD-RPA was higher than that of conventional RT-PCR, which indicating that LFD-RPA is capable of effectively and accurately detecting PDCoV. All the integrated data showed that LFD-RPA is a simple, visible, specific and sensitive tool for the rapid and accurate detection of PDCoV that is especially suitable for use in underequipped laboratories and at point-of-need facilities, Sensitivity of the LFD-RPA assay and conventional RT-PCR using 10-fold serial dilutions of standard control plasmids at concentrations ranging from 1 \u00d7 10 9 -1 \u00d7 10 1 copies/\u03bcL; previously tested PDCoV negative samples was used as a negative control. The top line on the lateral flow dipstick is the control line, and the next line is the test line. a Standard control plasmids at concentrations ranging from 1 \u00d7 10 9 -1 \u00d7 10 1 copies/\u03bcL. b Standard control plasmids at concentrations ranging from 1 \u00d7 10 9 -1 \u00d7 10 1 copies/\u03bcL (lanes [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , and N is a negative control.

However, those methods inherently require the use of specialized equipment and long reaction times, thus restricting their use in rapid detection and by low-resource laboratories. Although the LAMP assay is also an isothermal amplification technique that does not require expensive equipment, optimum reaction conditions that require a specific amplification temperature were performed at 63\u00b0C for 70 min and required five primers [26] . Furthermore, the results were visualized by adding SYBR Green I dye to Fig. 4 Repeatability of the LFD-RPA assay. a Inter-assay repeatability test: The standard control plasmids, at concentrations 1 \u00d7 10 8 , 1 \u00d7 10 5 and 1 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcL (lane 1-3), were detected in three rounds under the same conditions. b Intra-assay repeatability test: The standard control plasmids, at concentrations 1 \u00d7 10 8 , 1 \u00d7 10 5 and 1 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcL, repeat three tests at the same time under the same conditions. The top line on the lateral flow dipstick is the control line, and the next line is the test line the reaction tube [26] . Real-time RT-PCR and RT-PCR, which are simple methods for detecting PDCoV, have been developed with high sensitivity and specificity, but these assays are difficult to perform in resource-poor areas and are not appropriate for field detection of PDCoV [25, 30] . Recently, a rapid and accurate real-time RT-RPA was established for the detection of PDCoV [25] , while observations of results require specific equipment. However, compared with previous studies, LFD-RPA was carried out at a lower temperature (10-37\u00b0C), under a shorter time (< 20 min) and required only a pair of primers in this study. In addition, the amplification product was visible on the LF dipstick inspected by the naked eye within 10 min and by untrained personnel. Furthermore, the LFD-RPA could also be easily performed in a water bath or even using body heat in field conditions, which favors the point-of-care detection of PDCoV and those scenarios involving a lack laboratory equipment. Thus, LFD-RPA offers significant benefits, and this method could be an ideal tool to improve the diagnostic efficiency and may contribute to effective surveillance of PDCoV in epidemical areas.",

Conventional PCR was used to compare sensitivity with the LFD-RPA assay, and previously tested PDCoV negative samples was used as a negative control. Therefore, 1 \u03bcL diluted DNA was used as a template for LFD-RPA and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min with 300 rpm constant shaking. The diluted DNA was also used in the conventional PCR reaction.",

All samples were then examined for the presence of PDCoV by conventional PCR and LFD-RPA to evaluate the detection efficiency of both assays. The conventional PCR volume 20 \u03bcL system as follow: 1 \u03bcL Pri-meSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), 4 \u03bcL 5\u00d7PrimeSTAR GXL Buffer, 2\u03bcL dNTP Mixture (10 \u03bcM), 1 \u03bcL of each primer N-F/N-R (Table 2) , and 1 \u03bcL DNA template and 10 \u03bcL double distilled H 2 O (ddH 2 O). The temperature profile consisted of activation at 98\u00b0C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of PCR at 98\u00b0C for 10 s, 60\u00b0C for 15 s, 68\u00b0C for 40 s and a final extension step at 68\u00b0C for 3 min. Meantime, positive and negative controls were set up in PCR reaction and the positive bands of clinical samples were recovered for sequencing. The LFD-RPA assays were performed the same as those mentioned above. For each sample, the reaction was tested three times to determine whether a sample was positive or negative. ",
