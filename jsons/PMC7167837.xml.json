Its utility includes determining whether infection is indeed present, helping to guide antibiotic choices, and identifying the microbiological impact of novel therapies and vaccines. While sputum specimens are used for these purposes in adults, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is employed in those who are unable to expectorate, such as young children1 and mechanically ventilated adults.2 However, as contamination from the upper airways often occurs, quantitative culture for BAL1, 2 is usually employed when bacteria are identified.",

Further, the associations between bacterial load and inflammatory markers in children with chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD) or protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) are also unknown. PBB, CSLD, and bronchiectasis are believed to form a continuum of chronic endobronchial disorders of increasing severity.15 We, therefore, examined total cell counts (TCCs) and neutrophil counts associated with bacterial load in 655 children with these chronic endobronchial disorders, and 67 disease controls, to determine the appropriate threshold to define infection. IL\u20108 concentrations in BAL fluid were measured in a small subset of children with CSLD/bronchiectasis. Based on our previous study,14 we hypothesized that compared with negative cultures, BAL samples with bacterial pathogen loads \u2265104 CFU/mL are associated with elevated inflammatory indices (elevated airway TCC, neutrophils, and/or IL\u20108) in children with chronic endobronchial disorders.",

Statistically significant associations using univariate analysis were seen for Indigenous status (positively associated with high TCC, negatively associated with airway neutrophilia), virus detection (positively associated with airway neutrophilia), macrolide antibiotic use (negatively associated with airway neutrophilia), and bacterial load (positively associated with high TCC at 105 CFU/mL and airway neutrophilia at 104 and 105 CFU/mL). In the small subset of 67 NT children with IL\u20108 data, bacterial load \u2265105 CFU/mL was positively associated with >250 pg/mL (odds ratio 5.49, 95%CI 1.39\u201021.6). In multivariable analysis, bacterial load \u2265105 CFU/mL remained independently associated with high TCC and airway neutrophilia (Table 4). Compared to \u2265105 CFU/mL, a threshold of \u2265104 CFU/mL had higher sensitivity, but lower specificity for all three markers of inflammation (Supplementary Table S1).",

Unfortunately, there is no \u201cdiagnostic gold standard\u201d and both are imperfect predictors. Nevertheless we aimed to determine the most appropriate bacterial load threshold to define lower airway infection by examining associations with inflammatory markers.

In adults with bronchiectasis, treatment with antibiotics significantly reduced bacterial load and concomitant airway inflammation in a dose\u2010dependent manner.25 Lower airway inflammation is a broad term that includes increased TCC, neutrophils and cytokines (eg, IL\u20108, free neutrophil elastase, matrix metalloproteinases, TNF\u2010alpha) in lower airway specimens.25, 26, 27 It is possible that employing more sensitive measures or a broader range of airway inflammatory markers may lead to a lower threshold. Nevertheless, a threshold \u2265105 CFU/mL was established for infants with CF using similar indicators of inflammation to those used in our study.1 Children were younger in the original CF study (mean age 17\u2010months, range 1\u201052), the predominant pathogens were S aureus, P aeruginosa, and H influenzae, and 30 of the 150 BAL procedures were conducted in children hospitalized for an acute pulmonary exacerbation.1 The elevations in cell counts seen in our study at 104 CFU/mL (not apparent in the CF study)1 may be associated with S pneumoniae and/or M catarrhalis, two pathogens found less commonly in CF patients. Further, simultaneous colonization with S pneumoniae and H influenzae resulted in a synergistic pro\u2010inflammatory response (increased production of IL\u20108, the major neutrophil chemokine in the airway) in vitro and in a mouse model.28 An examination of pathogen\u2010specific thresholds, and pathogen\u2010pathogen interactions in a larger cohort, may help to explain differences in inflammatory responses to bacterial load.",

The high prevalence of bronchiectasis in Australian Indigenous children has long been recognized.29 In Qld, only 6% of control children and 7.5% with PBB were Indigenous; however, 21% of children with bronchiectasis were Indigenous. This may represent evidence from another Australian setting that Indigenous children are more likely to progress to bronchiectasis. Alternatively, Indigenous children could be less likely to present early with symptoms of chronic endobronchial infection, and the finding that TCCs were higher in Indigenous compared to non\u2010Indigenous children might reflect more advanced disease.",

There may, therefore, be residual confounding from unmeasured viruses, although the importance of rhinoviruses as pathogens in children is complicated by their presence in up to 45% of asymptomatic children when using sensitive molecular detection techniques.32, 33\n",

In contrast, there was no evidence of elevated inflammatory indices at bacterial load <104 CFU/mL.
