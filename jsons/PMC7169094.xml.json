Thus, development of new and alternate antiviral therapies has become important.1, 2 During the past decade, scientists have widely used the cellular RNA interference (RNAi) pathway approach to target a number of viral genes to restrain their expression.3, 4 In this pathway, long double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors are split into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) following which the RNA\u2010induced silencing complex includes one of the siRNA strands and slices the complementary target mRNA using ATP.5, 6 Short interfering RNA technology has been exploited to target disease\u2010causing genes as well as for functional studies.7, 8 Also, this strategy can target diverse types of viruses as even a tiny viral genome can provide several targetable regions. For example, siRNAs directed against different genes of deadly viruses like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),9, 10 influenza virus (INFV),11, 12 hepatitis B virus (HBV),13 SARS coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV),14, 15 human papillomavirus (HPV),16 and West Nile virus (WNV)17 in infected cells displayed encouraging results in inhibiting viral replication. Researchers have also used multiple siRNAs simultaneously to augment viral inhibition in a coordinated approach.18, 19 Short interfering RNAs for various human viruses like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), HBV, and HIV are also appearing in clinical trials, which further elucidate their importance in inhibiting viral infections.20 Thus, siRNAs have emerged as practically modular and adaptable therapeutics for treating viral infections. In this review, we will discuss the use of siRNAs against different viral families, their therapeutic applications, and design and delivery considerations. Further limitations of siRNAs as antivirals and the remedial measures are also discussed.",

There are many features that influence siRNA efficacy including GC (guanine\u2010cytosine) content, nucleotides at siRNA termini, thermodynamic properties, siRNA structure, and accessibility of the target site.127, 128 Also, the siRNAs should be developed against conserved target sites to prevent viral escape due to mutations.129 It has been suggested that a single target site might not be enough for durable viral silencing so using multiple siRNAs against several target sites can also prevent viral escape.19 In addition, chemically modified nucleotides can also be used to enhance the stability or reduce off\u2010target effects of siRNAs,130, 131, 132 eg, modified siRNAs used against HBV infection were found to have significantly increased half\u2010life and activity in human serum as compared with the unmodified siRNAs.133\n",

This method often involves cationic lipids to overcome the negative charge associated with siRNAs.135 Lately, stable nucleic acid lipid particles have been used to efficiently stabilize and transport siRNAs.136 Morrissey et al used stable nucleic acid lipid particles to deliver siRNAs against HBV, which efficiently inhibited the virus in mice.137 Next, the polymer\u2010based siRNA delivery vehicles (polyplexes) afford high structural and physicochemical flexibility while shielding the siRNAs against nucleases.138 Likewise, inorganic nanoparticles generated from calcium phosphate, gold, carbon, and iron oxides are sometimes preferred to transport siRNAs due to their small size and increased permeability in comparison with liposomes and polyplexes. Occasionally, surface ligands are incorporated with the nanoparticles to enhance selective targeting of the diseased cells.139 Plasmid and viral vectors are also used as expression cassettes for sustained silencing effect. However, use of plasmids limits the delivery efficiency as compared with the viral vectors.140, 141 Alternatively, direct injection into the infected tissue may also help in targeting the specific cells.134\n",

This may be due to the fact that these methods were not trained on viral siRNAs. Viral siRNA predictor, available at http://crdd.osdd.net/servers/virsirnapred, the original algorithm for calculating inhibition potential of viral siRNAs, is a support vector machine\u2013based method for predicting the activity of viral siRNA. This algorithm was developed using published viral siRNAs using many features such as nucleotide frequency, thermodynamic factors, and nucleotide location to predict the competence of siRNAs targeting pathogenic viruses.153 These online resources (Table 2) will facilitate the researchers in selecting or designing efficient siRNAs for antiviral therapeutic development.",
