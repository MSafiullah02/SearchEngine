Global epidemics caused by two highly pathogenic coronavirus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were reported during 2002-2003 and 2012 (ongoing). [5,13] Although SARS-CoV-2 share similar sequencing characteristics with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, study of case series suggested the viral nucleic acid shedding pattern of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is different from SARS-CoV, which had a modest viral loads in the early stage and peaked approximately 10 days after symptoms onset [14]. Our study analyzed the dynamic profile of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The median period between onset of symptoms and positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result was 16 days (IQR, 10-23). (Fig. 1A) Positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was detected soon after the onset of symptoms, with a gradually decreasing trend thereafter. We showed that after 4 weeks (>28 days), 26.3% samples are still positive for SARS-CoV-2. (Fig. 1B) The above findings suggested that SARS-CoV-2 viral replication has a relatively long period in infected patients compared to SARS-CoV. [14] Although viral replication is not necessarily associated with severity of immunopathological damage, it implied that, to limit transmission of the disease, infected patients need exclusive monitoring until at least two consecutive negative RT-PCR results are obtained. It should be noted that one patient had a positive result of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR assay on day 42 after the onset of symptoms. This, currently, is the longest period had been reported.",

Older patients (\u226565 years) had a significant longer time interval (18 days) of positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result than patients <65 years (14 days). (Fig. 2A) One possible explanation is that the dysfunction of immune system in older patients resulted in a prolonged elimination of the virus.

We found that 21 patients (30%) had a positive third-time RT-PCR test, even though the results were negative for the previous two tests.
