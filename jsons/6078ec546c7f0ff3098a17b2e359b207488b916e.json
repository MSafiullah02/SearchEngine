By April 11, 2020, more than 1.5 million people were diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) and over 90,000 died. 3 As of April, 2020, the United States, with over 500,000 confirmed cases and close to 20,000 deaths, 3 has surpassed Italy in overall death toll and currently has the largest number of cases.

CARG members developed these practical recommendations for patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals to inform care delivery for older patients with cancer during the COVID-19 crisis.

If an in-person evaluation is absolutely necessary, followup appointments should be coordinated across the cancer disciplines (surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation oncologist) so that visits are minimized. Telephone or video visits in lieu of traditional clinic visits can avoid unnecessary exposure to the virus while continuing the therapeutic relationship and ongoing cancer management. Many centers in heavily-impacted areas are only allowing patients to come to in-person visits if they require a treatment or procedure. Visitors are restricted in most centers, although exceptions may need to be made for patients who require a companion for communication or for physical or cognitive disability.

            "text": "In older patients who are receiving or considering intravenous cancer therapies, there are additional considerations during this pandemic. For example, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) developed policies for intravenous cancer therapies given the pervasive spread of the virus in the New York City area. These policies propose that therapies (especially cytotoxic chemotherapies), with median overall survival benefits of 2 months or less should be avoided during the pandemic, particularly in frail older adults, as the harms likely outweigh the benefits. For adjuvant therapies with incremental benefits, these potential benefits must now be weighed against the risk of infection incurred by coming for treatment visits. Oral therapies are favored when clinically appropriate. For older patients currently on adjuvant therapies, shorter durations of treatments are suggested when longer duration has demonstrated minimal incremental benefit. Furthermore, lengthening treatment interval where clinically safe should be considered; pharmacy colleagues can guide safety and interval considerations based on existing data. In older patients with stable and/or low-volume stage IV disease, a treatment holiday of 4-8 weeks should be considered, particularly during the weeks anticipated to be the peak of infections for a particular region. Mediport (i.e., implanted venous access port) flush intervals should be extended to at least 12 weeks or longer. Table 2 During the pandemic, decisions regarding whether to initiate or continue cancer treatment in older patients should be based on, as always, (1) the preferences of the patient, (2) the degree of age-related vulnerability, and (3) the balance between treatment benefits and harms. 23 Preferences should be elicited related to what outcomes matter; older adults often value function and quality-of-life just as much as, if not more than, survival. [24] [25] [26] Age-related vulnerability should be assessed using valid geriatric assessment (GA) tools recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the International Society of Geriatric Oncology, as standard oncology performance measures are inadequate for older adults. 27, 28 Benefits and harms of treatment must be estimated from the available evidence, but adjusted based on patient preferences and vulnerability. 29 Given that frail/vulnerable patients with multi-morbidity, cognitive impairment, and functional limitations are often excluded from clinical trials, intensive treatments in such patients may be associated with reduced benefits and greater harms. [30] [31] [32] [33] Added to potential treatment harms are the risks of exposure, infection, and poor outcomes from infection with SARS-CoV-2, which are amplified in older adults and in patients with cancer. 8, 34, 35 Synthesizing the above three factors will best guide treatment decisions, as data reflecting treatment safety in the COVID-19 era are currently lacking. For fit older patients with little-to-no GA domain impairments who seek life-prolonging therapy, treatment considerations should be similar to those in younger patients, per national and institutional guidelines. Chronologic age alone should never preclude treatment in an older adults, as age-cutoffs are often arbitrary, biased, and do not represent true risk factors that are aging-related but heterogeneously present in older patients. 36 However, the lag time to benefit of treatment in certain cancers must now be weighed against the additional short-term risks of COVID exposure and allocation of scarce resources. 37 For example, in a woman age 75 years old newly diagnosed with breast carcinoma in situ, the risk of developing symptoms from her cancer in her remaining lifetime with no treatment may be outweighed by the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in the hospital while undergoing breast cancer surgery and/or radiation. Surgery would also take up valuable operating room resources such as personal protective equipment, ventilators, and anesthesia staff that may be more urgently needed for intensive care provided to COVID-19 positive patients (see \"Ethical",

Accordingly, an active surveillance approach or treatment with oral endocrine therapy only may be optimal, especially if the patient prefers to limit encounters with the healthcare system or values avoiding treatment-related morbidity over gains in survival. 38 For vulnerable older patients with cancer with one or more GA domain impairments, treatment decisions must factor the number of impairments, their nature, and their severity. For patients with mobility or Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL) limitations, traveling to and from appointments or J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f treatment sessions and coordinating both cancer and supportive therapies will be complex given reduced clinic hours and community transportation options. For patients with cognitive or sensory deficits, engaging with virtual appointments for monitoring of treatment adherence and toxicity will be challenging. These complexities and challenges will be enhanced in older patients with minimal social supports and of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. For frail patients with multiple comorbidities-some of which may be life-limiting independently of their cancer-intensive treatment may be an added stressor that not only poses an additional risk of COVID-19 but also depletes remaining physiologic reserves necessary to fight it. All of these impairments may increase the risks of treatment toxicity, discontinuation, and mortality, [39] [40] [41] [42] and these risks must be weighed against less intensive treatment options that may minimize harm without sacrificing benefit. Evident in the above considerations is the necessity to evaluate these geriatric domains alongside or in place of traditional performance status assessment [e.g., Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status]; the GA better identifies vulnerabilities that can greatly augment treatment harms in the context of the pandemic. 27, 43 The information gathered can be input into toxicity risk calculators validated in geriatric oncology, such as the CARG (http://www.mycarg.org) and CRASH toxicity tools (https://moffitt.org/eforms/crashscoreform/) 44, 45 Life expectancy calculators such as those found on ePrognosis (https://eprognosis.ucsf.edu) 27 are useful adjuncts to treatment decisionmaking. In patients whose estimated non-cancer based life expectancy is less than the time to benefit expected from a particular cancer therapy, starting or continuing this therapy during the pandemic likely constitutes a net harm. Even brief GA screening tools such as the Geriatric 8 (G8) and Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) incorporate assessment of GA domains, predict outcomes such as mortality and hospitalizations, and can triage those who need further assessment. 46, 47 Regardless of what tool is used, the GA not only informs prognosis and leads to modifications in treatment, it guides nononcologic interventions that can optimize outcomes regardless of what cancer treatment is chosen. 48, 49 Even in COVID-era, social workers, physical therapists, pharmacists, and others essential to the care of older adults can interact with the patient and caregiver through telehealth. The GA improves communication between oncologists and patient and caregiver satisfaction, giving more control to older patients and their caregivers during this time of heightened uncertainty. 50 Modifications to treatments based on COVID-19 risk for specific disease types are currently derived from expert opinion and may be center-or institution-specific. It is recommended that clinical teams review their treatment approaches and develop recommendations for older patients with specific clinical scenarios. Kutikov et al. provided a framework that can be adapted for treatment scenarios for older and more frail individuals. 51 Figure 2 is an example of how this framework could be used to guide decisions for older patients with breast cancer.",

Patients may shed virus after symptom resolution; 52,53 for seasonal coronavirus, viral shedding may last up to 4 weeks. 54 Patients with cancer may have a longer incubation period. We recommend that, at minimum, patients should self-isolate for at least 14 days, with the last 3 days being asymptomatic before re-initiation of systemic cancer treatment is considered. Once patients become asymptomatic, the decision to restart systemic treatment should depend on the benefits and harms of delaying cancer treatment further. Among older patients, consideration of age-related conditions is important as the risks are potentially greater (e.g., higher risk of hospitalizations). If possible, cancer treatment should be further delayed if the benefits of restarting treatment do not outweigh the risks (e.g., stage IV disease that is stable, maintenance therapy, treatments that only provide small incremental benefits). As data emerge, treatments such as radiation may prove to be safe even during active COVID-19 infection and can be considered if indicated or as a temporizing measure for cancer control, though frequency of clinic visits for these therapies remains a concern for exposure. Radiotherapy should be provided with the shortest number of visits required as possible. 55 Given increasing community transmission, many patients have known exposure to COVID-19 (e.g., close contact with someone in household) but no personal evidence of infection. Availability of testing for this group is variable. In our opinion, cancer treatments should be held among older patients in this group, and they should be advised to self-isolate for at least 14 days, with last 3 days being asymptomatic before re-initiation of cancer treatment is considered.",

In this crisis, clinicians must adapt to non-ideal situations. Previous studies have shown active discussion about an individual's goals and preferences, specifically as they relate to end of life issues, is linked with reductions in hospital utilization and aggressiveness of care at end of life, which is subsequently associated with better quality of life among both patients and caregivers. 60 Given the added threat of COVID-19, early and frank discussions regarding goals, values, and preferences are imperative. Effective communications skills are even more important right now as physical distancing barriers may already affect the quality of these conversations. Alternative and innovative methods of communication will be required, such as multiperson video conferencing, in order to decrease the burden of social isolation by ensuring caregiver and other loved ones can participate during these difficult discussions. Conversations regarding goals of care should remain as broad as possible, including decisions about specific treatments, the intensity of care, and advanced care planning.

In such events, rationing and intentional resource allocation (and sometimes reallocation) strategies will be required. American medicine has traditionally functioned by maximizing resource allocation to the patient sitting in front of us, with little need to give account for any impact upon society as a whole. The pandemic requires that the underlying philosophical principles of American medicine--prioritizing patient autonomy, are shifting in a way that more closely models European practice--a more utilitarian consideration of the reality of limited resources that must be used in a consistent, transparent, and responsible way to do the most Given the data indicating the increased risks for severe illness and mortality in older adults with COVID- 19, 15, 23 it is important to consider whether and how a health system will make unbiased decisions about allocating resources in situations where there are potential shortages. As an example, guidance issued from New York state 24 explicitly prohibits consideration of age in any resource allocation process, following a \"most lives saved\" approach. Other institutions are incorporating the idea of \"highest lifeyears saved\" approach, using age, comorbidities, or measures of life expectancy as a \"tie-breaker\" in cases where multiple patients are designated into the same triage categories. 25 Triage based on the Single Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score 26 is, at the time of this writing, recommended by New York state policy; it has not been extensively validated in COVID-19 positive cohorts or older patients with cancer, 27 and it fails to account for pre-existing comorbidities or frailty that might limit life expectancy. Additionally, organ dysfunction differentially affects older and younger adults; older and younger adults with the same SOFA scores may not have similar survival rates due to the interactions between age, frailty, and illness that influence prognosis. 28 A similar trade-off between the ethical tenets of patient autonomy and distributive justice arises when considering whether to offer CPR to COVID-19 positive patients. Although specific data about postresuscitation survival is not widely available, outcomes from CPR are poor in older adults with COVID-19. 29 CPR is an aerosolizing procedure, 30 and given scarcity of available PPE and the potential risk posed to health care providers, the traditional American approach to CPR may need to be reconsidered in this setting as an \"opt-in\" instead of \"opt-out\" procedure. This would be equivalent to setting a default DNR for all COVID-19 positive patients, which would represent a sea-change in policy and practice for American health care. Given the variation across communities in patient demand, available resources, and institutional policies, we agree with the American Society of Clinical Oncology's recommendation that oncologists become familiar with their institution's allocation plans and use best practices for health communication so they can have informed conversations about these with their patients. 65 Ethically, oncologists will face broader challenges in selecting appropriate therapy for their older patients with cancer. 66 Immunosuppressive antineoplastic therapies expose patients to higher risk of a severe or fatal COVID-19 infection, as do repeated trips to medical settings for the treatments or toxicity evaluations. Even antineoplastic therapies which are not immunosuppressive can cause adverse effects which weaken an older adult's physiologic resilience, 67 creating more susceptibility to adverse outcomes from COVID-19. The benefit-to-risk ratio of therapy is therefore shifted at this time, and in particular, therapies for metastatic disease that offer only small incremental benefits to survival should be reconsidered, and a supportive care approach should be prioritized. This also represents a potential shift away from patient autonomy, as some patients and their families express hesitancy to \"give up\".",
