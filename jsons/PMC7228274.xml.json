Although the time span of study registration was less than 2 weeks (30 January 2020 to 12 February 2020), subtle changes in the classification of registered trials could be seen from the development of the epidemic, including that the proportion of studies targeting critically ill patients had gradually increased in the latter period, and patients' physical and psychological rehabilitation had also received attention. Based on the current registered trials, together with the epidemic situation in China and published literatures of 2019\u2010nCoV, we made a preliminary assessment on the prospects of therapy for 2019\u2010nCoV and the availability of drugs in the short term.",

In terms of diagnosis, seven literatures were published in Radiology to conduct computed tomography analysis for more than 80 patients to summarize the imaging characteristics of NCP.\n1\n In addition, there were two literatures on nucleic acid detection of 2019\u2010nCoV.\n2\n It should be noted that there was no shortage of institutions for nucleic acid detection and even a few of them had been approved by the government, however, the data to prove the sensitivity and consistency were still lacking. And the New England Journal published the first clinical evidence of tumor patients in the outbreak of 2019\u2010nCoV, supporting that tumor patients may be more susceptible to infection due to the influence of malignant tumor, chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and other factors on immune status.\n3\n In terms of treatment, no successful randomized controlled trial (RCT) had been published, which also reflected the bottleneck of current treatment. In general, finding effective targeted drugs remains an urgent work.",

The two major concerns of antiviral therapy are certainly: one is prognosis of treatment: for mild to moderate patients, reducing critical illness rate is the primary objective; and for severe or critical illness patients, reducing mortality or improving recovery of pulmonary function matters more, which are indicators of efficacy that can be evaluated in the near future. The other is the rate and time for the virus to turn negative, which is related to patient's speed of recovery and prevention of the virus transmission. Therefore, improvement of clinical symptoms is more important to reduce the incidence of severe illness and mortality, and the detection of virus nucleic acid has a longer term significance for reducing transmission. However, there were several cases reported that patients with turning negative virus nucleic acid detection after treatment became positive again after a period of time. Therefore, the frequency and time interval of detection after turning negative need to be further discussed. If the frequency of detection is increased or the interval is prolonged, combined with the improvement of clinical symptoms, the disease progression could be more accurately estimated, and whether the patient still carries the virus and is infectious could be further determined.",

For example, two studies of remdesivir (NCT04252664, NCT 04257656) used time to clinical recovery (TTCR) and time to clinical improvement (TTCI) as primary endpoint, respectively, instead of virus nucleic acid detection or survival status of severe patients. The former is based on the patient's body temperature, breathing rate, oxygen saturation, and the improvement of clinical symptoms; the latter is based on the time for improvement of the clinical status. And given the relatively low mortality rate of about 2% for NCP at present, the choices of endpoint were based more on recommendations for influenza drug research, in which mortality is not the primary endpoint in most studies. Besides, TTCR or TTCI as a surrogate endpoint required smaller sample sizes than the other dichotomous endpoints (such as disease control rate).
