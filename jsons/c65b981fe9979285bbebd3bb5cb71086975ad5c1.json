The ability of departments to provide residents teleradiology capability varies widely, from fully diagnostic and integrated home radiology workstations, to limited abilities to review radiology information systems (RIS), picture archiving and communication system (PACS), and electronic medical records (EMR) on virtual desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones (typically not of diagnostic quality but may be functional) (3) .

Fortunately, decreased outpatient exams and procedures allow renewed flexibility in the on-site hospital workforce. Many residency programs adopt a shift work model, with a cohort of residents on home isolation specifically to serve as backup workforce replacements should on-site team members require replacement due to sickness, quarantine or redeployment. Sickness in essence necessitates quarantine of a portion of the in-house residents (6) . Distinguishing between home \"isolation\" and \"quarantine\" is crucial, because it identifies residents who will serve as a backup response team. Protecting residents at increased risk, notably those who are immunocompromised or pregnant, by assigning them to home isolation work shifts should be considered. Additional factors to consider are community infection rate, appropriate access to personal protective equipment (PPE), and degree of on-site patient exposure.",

These shifts require documentation and compliance with duty hour restrictions. Isolation radiology residents can perform clinical duties in a number of manners, even those with limited teleradiology capabilities. Suggested roles of engagement (all of which assist the resident in meeting ACGME Milestones) in clinical care include assuming the role of a reading room or \"call triage\" assistant, protocoling patient studies, interpreting studies, and communicating with patients and families ( Table 2) . Radiology resident education will also be significantly affected in stage 2, albeit in different ways than other specialties' residencies. The ACGME describes suspension of some educational activities in Stage 2 due to residents shifting to more patient care duties associated with the pandemic (1). The reported drop in clinical volume ranging from 50%D 3 5 X X to 70% (7) means Radiology has unique needs and opportunities to focus on promoting a virtual landscape for dissemination of educational content.",

In the virtual escape room, teams vie with one another to scavenge assigned reference articles for answers to detailed questions that unlock the next clue. At the journal club, a recent patient clinical presentation and case images frame the clinical question to be answered from the literature, complete with module learning objectives, outline, resident and fellow presenters, multilevel learners (residents, fellows, faculty, medical student participants) and, where applicable, radpath or epidemiology segments.
