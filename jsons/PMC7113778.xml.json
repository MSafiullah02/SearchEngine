VEEV is an enveloped alphavirus with a non-segmented positive strand RNA genome of 11.4 kb (Paesseler and Weaver, 2009). VEEV infection causes a wide range of clinical symptoms ranging from unapparent disease to acute encephalitis in both humans and equines (Johnson and Martin, 1974). Mortality rates in equines have been estimated at 19\u201383% whereas mortality in humans is <1% (Walton et al., 1973, de la Monte et al., 1985).",

            "text": "Despite numerous efforts to develop antiviral therapies and vaccine countermeasures, currently there is no FDA approved antiviral drug or vaccine for use against VEEV infection. Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have shown immense potential to be used as an antiviral therapeutic for various human viral diseases. Human immunodeficiency virus, polio virus, hepatitis B virus, West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus, foot and mouth disease virus, influenza virus and chikungunya virus have been successfully inhibited using virus specific siRNAs (Jacque et al., 2002, Ge et al., 2003, Hui et al., 2004, Tompkins et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2004, Giladi et al., 2003, Chen et al., 2004, Dash et al., 2008). Recently, it was shown that artificial microRNAs (miRNAs) which are small RNA molecules expressed under the backbone of endogeneous cellular miRNAs are more effective inhibitors of cellular genes (Maczuga et al., 2012). Artificial miRNAs are expressed though RNA polymerase II and are argued to be less cytotoxic than siRNAs due to their relatively low concentration inside the cells. Double stranded siRNAs can trigger interferon response which can cause cytotoxicity. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) is transcribed through RNA polymerase III and can saturate dicer or other RNAi proteins which can lead to a reduced RNAi response and increased cellular toxicity. Hence artificial miRNAs have a clear advantage over siRNA or shRNAs in both in vitro and in vivo gene silencing (Boudreau et al., 2009, Xie et al., 2013). Artificial miRNAs have been studied as an antiviral approach for many viruses including adenoviruses, rabies virus, dengue virus and porcine reproductive and respiratory virus and has been shown to be an effective inhibitor of virus replication with minimal or no cytotoxicity (Ibrisimovic et al., 2013, Xia et al., 2013, Xie et al., 2013, Israsena et al., 2009).",

            "text": "In this study, we have targeted the viral non-structural protein-4 (nsp-4) region which encodes for the viral RNA dependent RNA polymerase and plays a critical role in the viral replication in the host cells. Previously, VEEV genome has been successfully targeted using siRNAs (O\u2019brien, 2007). We also tested nsp-4 as a potential target for RNA interference studies using siRNAs. Four siRNAs were designed against the nsp-4 region and were tested for their antiviral efficiency. Similar to the previous report, siRNAs were found to be protective against VEEV infection and hence nsp-4 was chosen as the target for the design of artificial miRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 1). Artificial miRNA sequences were designed using Blockit RNAi Web Designer tool (Invitrogen Inc.). Top three high scoring artificial miRNAs were selected and the oligos were synthesized along with a negative control sequence which is not specific against nsp-4 sequence (Invitrogen Inc.) (Fig. 1\nA). Artificial miRNAs were cloned into pcDNA\u21226.2-GW/EmGFP-miR vector (Invitrogen Inc.) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Fig. 1B). To determine the toxicity of artificial miRNAs in in vitro experiments, we measured cell proliferation after artificial miRNA transfection using MTT assay. 100\u2013400 ng of plasmid vector harboring artificial miRNAs were transfected in BHK-21 cells in each well of 96 well plates and incubated for 24 h. MTT assay (Invitrogen Inc.) was performed to evaluate the percentage of metabolically active cells. In our data, no significant toxic effect was observed due to the presence of artificial miRNAs in cells (Fig. 2\nA). Antiviral efficacy against VEEV was tested in vitro in BHK-21 cells (ATCC Inc.) using TC-83 which is a vaccine strain of VEEV and approved to be used in BSL-2 laboratory. Moreover, the sequence of nsp-4 in TC-83 strain is identical to that of virulent VEEV strain. To assess the antiviral activity of artificial miRNAs against VEEV infection, BHK-21 cells were transfected with artificial miRNAs using lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Life Technologies Inc.). Transfection was performed using 2 ug of total plasmid DNA per well of 12 well plates. Cells were incubated overnight after transfection and then infected with 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of TC-83. Cell supernatant and total cell lysates were harvested at 12 and 24 h post infection (p.i.). To estimate the amount of virus inhibition by artificial miRNAs, TCID50/ml (50% tissue culture infectious dose) was calculated from the cellular supernatant. TCID50 data suggested a significant inhibition of VEEV replication in presence of artificial miRNAs. The reduction of viral load in the cell supernatant was more pronounced at 12 h although significant inhibition was also observed at 24 h p.i. All the three artificial miRNAs showed protection against VEEV infection in vitro (Fig. 2B). Further, we performed real time PCR (RT-PCR) to estimate the reduction in the viral RNA load in the cells transfected with artificial miRNAs and infected with VEEV 12 h p.i. In cells treated with artificial miRNAs, the total viral RNA was significantly reduced with Mir-5 showing the maximum inhibition in viral RNA replication (Fig. 3\nA). We then quantitated the total viral protein to understand whether the inhibition of viral RNA transcription is also reflected at the translational level. 20 ug of total cellular protein was loaded on 4\u201312% Bis\u2013Tris gel followed by transfer on a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot was performed with a monoclonal antibody specific to E2 glycoprotein of VEEV. Mir-5 treated BHK-21 cells again showed the least amount of virus presence at 24 h p.i. in comparison to negative miRNA control cells. Inhibition of viral protein was also observed in Mir-1 and Mir-3 (Fig. 3B). We also observed the presence of artificial miRNAs and virus using fluorescent microscopy. Artificial miRNAs vectors express a green fluorescent protein (EmGFP) which indicates the presence of artificial miRNAs. BHK-21 cells were transfected with artificial miRNAs and then infected with 0.1 MOI of TC-83 which express a cherry red protein (Atasheva et al., 2008). We found that cells which are positive (green) for Mir-1, Mir-3 or Mir-5 did not show the presence of TC-83 virus (red) at 24 h p.i. Cells which were not transfected with artificial miRNAs were all positive for VEEV infection which is shown in red color (Fig. 3C).",

            "text": "It has been previously shown that expressing more than one miRNA in one single artificial miRNA vector construct may provide better inhibition of virus (Israsena et al., 2009). We therefore cloned two artificial miRNAs together in the same expression vector. One of the miRNAs was used as a backbone and digested with BamH I and Xho I whereas the other miRNA used as insert was digested with Bgl II and Xho I to excise out the insert. The insert was then ligated into the vector backbone to generate a construct which express two miRNAs. Two recombinant plasmids vectors were generated, Mir15 with Mir-1 and Mir-5, and Mir-35 which contains single miRNA sequence of Mir-3 and Mir-5. We then investigated the synergistic effect of expressing two miRNAs through a single expression vector against VEEV infection in BHK-21 cells. Cells were transfected as previously described and cell lysates and supernatant were collected. Virus titer from cell supernatant at 12 h p.i. showed protection by both Mir-15 and Mir-35 in comparison to the negative control. Similarly at 24 h p.i, total viral load in supernatant was reduced in cells treated with Mir35.However, combination of two artificial miRNAs did not further reduce the viral load in comparison to single artificial miRNA treatment (Fig. 4\nA). We further quantified the total viral protein from the cell lysates using western blot. In accordance with the virus titer data, reduction in total viral protein was observed in the cells treated with Mir-15 and Mir-35 but the combination treatment lead to a slight increase in the total viral protein in comparison to Mir-1, 3 and 5 treatment alone (Fig. 4B).",

Out of the three miRNAs tested, we found Mir-3 to be the most protective in reducing the total viral load in the cell supernatant. Combination of artificial miRNAs as a single construct did not confer increased antiviral activity compared to individual artificial miRNAs. This may have occurred due to relatively low concentrations of individual miRNAs when expressed together. However, artificial miRNAs were found to be non- toxic and effective inhibitors of VEEV replication in vitro. Due to their low toxicity without the need of chemical modifications as suggested for siRNAs (Bramsen and Kjems, 2011), these artificial miRNAs can be further tested in animal models for antiviral therapy against VEEV infection.",
