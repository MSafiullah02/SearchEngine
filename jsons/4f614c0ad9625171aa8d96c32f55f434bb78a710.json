Differences in host factors, such as age and underlying diseases, 50,60 may explain some differences. However, the differential cell line susceptibility, viral replication efficiency, ability to inhibit IFN production and receptor characteristics may also be responsible for the difference in the outcome of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. 43, 44 Compared with SARS and MERS, other HCoVsassociated pneumonia cases usually have relatively mild symptoms and recovered quickly. 19 Fatal cases were reported mainly in frail patients, such as neonates, the elderly and immunocompromised patients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 74, "end": 77, "text": "56,", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 78, "end": 80, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 224, "end": 226, "text": "59", "ref_id": "BIBREF58"}, {"start": 995, "end": 998, "text": "60,", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1001, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1141, "text": "61", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1733, "end": 1735, "text": "62", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 2022, "end": 2025, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2026, "end": 2028, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 2132, "end": 2135, "text": "53,", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 2136, "end": 2138, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2256, "end": 2258, "text": "58", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 2657, "end": 2660, "text": "43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 2661, "end": 2663, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 2792, "end": 2794, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1867, "end": 1874, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "RADIOLOGICAL"}, {"text": "At the moment, no specific therapy for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the other HCoVs infection is available.

Frequently used as an immunosuppressant drug to prevent rejection in organ transplantation by inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation, MPA also prevents replication of viral RNA. in vitro studies showed that MPA had strong inhibition activity against MERS-CoV. 71 However, use in a non-human primate model showed that all MPA-treated animals developed severe and/or fatal disease with higher mean viral loads than the untreated animals. 70 Passive immunotherapy using convalescent phase human plasma was also used in the treatment of SARS and MERS.
