The emergence of livestock associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended beta-lactamases (ESBL's) in enterobacteriaceae from food animals has initiated a public discussion in Western Europe, which severely increased pressure on veterinary antimicrobial use (Graveland et al., 2010; Vandendriessche et al., 2013). Antimicrobial resistance selection is predominantly driven by antimicrobial use (Bosman et al., 2013). Therefore, the intensive antimicrobial use in the veal sector urgently needs to be reduced, both for public health and political and economic reasons (MARAN, 2009, 2011; Pardon et al., 2012a).",

            "text": "Selection of calves based on disease risk and subsequently targetting metaphylactic antimicrobial treatment toward the high risk batches, is one potential strategy to rationally reduce antimicrobial consumption. Calf selection parameters include age at arrival, body weight, infection status for bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), presence of disease (umbilical infection, bovine respiratory disease (BRD) or neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD)) (Wilson et al., 2000) and sufficient uptake of colostrum (Gulliksen et al., 2009, Brscic et al., 2012, Pardon et al., 2013). Failure of passive transfer (FPT) shows a prevalence ranging between 20 and 80% in the United States (McDonough et al., 1994, Wilson et al., 2000, Stilwell and Carvalho, 2011). Also in Belgium on average 40% of veal calves had FPT, assuming that immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels lower than 10 g/L upon arrival indicate colostral deficiency (Pardon, 2012). The crucial role of sufficient IgG uptake in protecting calves from BRD, NCD and mortality has been evidenced on multiple occasions (Postema and Mol, 1984, Furman-Fratczak et al., 2011, Stilwell and Carvalho, 2011). These effects have been shown to last up to 3 months for BRD (Virtala et al., 1996). To evaluate colostrum uptake, several tests have been validated for healthy animals in the age category of 2\u20137 days (Weaver et al., 2000). Although that cheap indirect screening tests, such as determination of total protein (TP) with a refractometer, perform reasonably well, direct determination of immunoglobulins (Ig) or IgG is generally more specific (Weaver et al., 2000). In calves sampled within a week after birth a cut off value for IgG of 10 g/L is generally accepted to determine FPT, and has been linked with disease occurrence, although some studies reported higher cut-offs in particular situations (Waldner and Rosengren, 2009, Furman-Fratczak et al., 2011, Stilwell and Carvalho, 2011). In contrast, it is currently unknown whether Ig levels measured at the age of arrival in veal calves (2\u20134 weeks old) can be used as predictors of BRD or NCD. For the veal sector it would be interesting to identify, through testing of calves upon arrival, individual calves requiring an adapted treatment and herds of origin with an insufficient colostrum management.",

This type of operation is specialized in raising calves for 8 weeks, after which they are transported to a finisher herd. The sole criterion for farm selection was willingness to cooperate. Study calves were housed on slatted floors in the same air\u2013space. During the first 6 weeks calves were housed individually in metal framed pens, with 1.4 m2 floor surface and an air volume of 9.0 m3 per calf. After this period the metal framework was removed and the animals were kept in groups of 6 animals for the remaining of the raising period. The study compartment was physically isolated from the other calf units present at the farm by full walls and a separate ventilation system. The stable was mechanically ventilated at a 20% refreshing rate and temperature was maintained at 17 \u00b0C. Calves were fed a 21.2% crude protein (CP), 17.7% crude fat (CF) milk replacer (MR) diet at dry mater base. The amount of MR was gradually increased from 1.5 L (90 g powder/L) morning and evening at day 1 to twice daily 3 L at 110 g/L at the end of the study (day 18). Milk was individually provided in drinking buckets. In addition to MR calves received chopped straw (from 20 to 50 g/day over the 18 day study period) and starter concentrates (from 10 to 350 g/day; CP = 16%; CF = 2.8%).

Two Cox proportional hazards models (PROC PHREG) were built, with respectively NCD and BRD as outcome variable using Breslow ties. In each model, 7 predictors, being the 6 protein fractions (TP, albumin, A1g, A2g, Bg and Ig) and body weight at arrival as a potential confounder were evaluated. Calves arrived in three batches and in order to correct for clustering, arrival batch was added as fixed effect. Predictors were tested univariably both continuously as categorically, based on quartiles. If a significant effect was noted in one of the quartiles, a binary variable was constructed. The time between arrival and occurrence of NCD or BRD was defined as survival time and disease (either BRD or NCD) as the event. Censoring occurred at day 18, when the study ended, for each animal remaining undiseased. The model building procedure was as follows. First all predictors were tested univariably, and those with P\n < 0.20 were selected for multivariable modeling. The final multivariable model was built stepwise backwards, excluding non-significant variables. Next, all biologically relevant two-way interactions of significant fixed effects were tested. Significance was set at P\n < 0.05 and P\n < 0.10 was considered a trend. Wald's test was used to assess parameter estimate significance.

Given the intensive daily monitoring it was no surprise to find a much higher BRD incidence (60% in the first three weeks) compared to previously reported figures in white veal calves over the complete production cycle (Brscic et al., 2012, Pardon et al., 2012b). Also for NCD the cumulative incidence in the present study was three times higher than previously reported (Pardon et al., 2012b). These observations confirm that disease incidence is masked in practice due to the administration of antimicrobial group treatments. Given the very similar prevalence of FPT in the present study compared to previous work in Europe and the US, and because of the systematic presence of all respiratory pathogens in veal herds (Wilson et al., 2000, Pardon et al., 2011, Pardon, 2012), the study most likely has a good external validity for the veal sector.",

This test is expensive in contrast to electrophoresis or refractometry to be used at large scale in the veal industry. Therefore the authors opted to use serum electrophoresis to determine the concentration of Ig's, a test which is used routinely in many veterinary diagnostic laboratories all over Europe. At the age of 3 weeks, the Ig fraction consists for the vast majority of IgG (95%), and therefore results obtained by electrophoresis are highly similar to those from tests which only determine IgG (Burton et al., 1989).",

This observation is in contrast with previous studies which could not evidence such an association (Postema and Mol, 1984, Postema et al., 1987). The most likely explanation for this difference is suboptimal disease expression and thus detection by the administration of antimicrobial group treatments in previous studies. Whereas in the present study the optimal cut-off to predict BRD in veal calves is 7.5 g/L, previous studies used 10 g/L as cut off. Maternal antibodies quickly decline after birth and normal IgG range for healthy calves, which have received enough colostrum, is reported to be between 10 and 15 g/L at the age of 2\u20133 weeks (Hassig et al., 2007). Therefore, it is not illogical that calves with FPT have levels below 10 g/L at the age of 2\u20133 weeks. Calves with Ig < 7.5 g/L had a substantial higher BRD hazard and according to Berge et al. (2005) animal welfare might be compromised when no antimicrobials are administered to this group at arrival. However, since only 26% of the calves were involved, group treatment does not comply with prudent use of antimicrobials. Also, for example in the Netherlands and Belgium, prophylactic administration of antimicrobials is forbidden or strongly discouraged, respectively.",

The observed association between Ig levels, measured at the age of 2\u20133 weeks, and BRD is also interesting for conventional dairy and beef farming. It enlarges the window in which calves can be tested for FPT up to the third week of life, facilitating routine checking of FPT in a herd. In this context it is important to emphasize that measurement of TP, the cheapest option, is no longer useful at the age of 2\u20133 weeks in contrast to in the first days of life. In calves aged 2\u20133 weeks albumin concentration has increased, decreasing the proportion of Ig's in TP, and this might explain absence of a significant association of TP and disease (Mohri et al., 2007). Also the well-known influence of hydration status and protein loss by various causes (e.g. diarrhea) on TP levels (Weaver et al., 2000) might have played a role as some animals were already diseased at testing or shortly thereafter.",

Also in previous studies C. parvum was the most frequently isolated pathogen in veal calf diarrhea (McDonough et al., 1994, Hoet et al., 2003). There was however a significant association of NCD with increasing levels of alpha-2 globulin. NCD already was present at arrival or developed shortly thereafter, and therefore several animals might already have had inflamed intestines. Since the alpha-2 globulin fraction contains the acute phase proteins haptoglobulin and ceruloplasmin, this already ongoing inflammation most likely explains the observed association.",

It is not unlikely, that in cohorts in which another virus predominates, a seronegative status for that particular virus will be a risk factor.

For practical use, an Ig cut-off of 7.5 g/L is recommended. The other protein fractions determined by routine electrophoresis, including TP, did not display any association of direct practical use. Secondly, calves seronegative for BCV and BRSV at arrival had an increased BRD risk in the first 3 weeks of the production cycle. Therefore, assuring a seropositive status for these viruses either by vaccination on the farm of origin or by provision of colostrum from a vaccinated cow might be an appropriate approach to reduce the BRD risk and subsequently prudent antimicrobial use in the veal calf sector.",
