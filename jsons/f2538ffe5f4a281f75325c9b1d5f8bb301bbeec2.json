This is achieved by considering a multi-stage infection model on networks. Using pairwise approximation with a standard closure, a number of important characteristics of disease dynamics are derived analytically, including the final size of an epidemic and a threshold for epidemic outbreaks. Stochastic simulations of dynamics on networks are performed and compared to the results of pairwise models for several realistic examples of infectious diseases to illustrate the role played by the number of stages in the disease dynamics. The agreement between the pairwise and simulation methods is excellent in the cases we consider.",

In many cases, to obtain the first approximation of the spread of a disease it is sufficient to use a version of the classical SIR model (Kermack and McKendrick 1927) [33] . However, major outbreaks of avian and swine influenza (Ferguson et al. 2006 ) [19] , SARS [15] , and more recently, ebola (Chowell, Nishiura 2014) [10] , have highlighted the need for a more accurate description of the disease dynamics that would provide predictive power to be used for developing measures for disease control and prevention (Keeling, Rohani, 2008) [32] .",

            "text": "One of the major simplifying assumptions often used in mathematical models of disease dynamics is the exponential distribution of infectious periods. Effectively, this means that the chance of an individual recovering during any given time period does not depend on the duration of time that individual has already been infected. Whilst such an assumption may provide significant mathematical convenience and be reasonably realistic in some situations, most often it is violated, and this requires the inclusion of the precise distribution of infectious periods in the model (Bailey 1954; Hope-Simpson 1952) [4, 23] . There are several methods that can be employed to explicitly include a non-exponential distribution, including a multi-stage approach (Anderson and May 1992; Cox and Miller 1965) [2, 11] , an integro-differential formulation (Hethcote and Tudor 1980; Keeling and Grenfell 1997) [22, 30] , and a PDE-based formulation akin to that for age-structured models (Anderson and May 1992) [1] . In the multi-stage framework, it is assumed that the infectious stage of a disease is characterised by a number K of distinct stages (Cox and Miller 1965 2001) [11, 35, 36] , with the duration of each stage being an independent exponentially distributed random number. Due to the fact that the sum of independent exponentially distributed random variables obeys a gamma distribution (Durrett 2010) [16] , one can replace an exponential distribution with the mean infectious period 1/\u03b3 by a gamma distribution \u0393(K, 1/(K\u03b3)) that has the same mean infectious period 1/\u03b3. The so-called linear chain trick (Cox and Miller 1965; MacDonald 1978) [11, 38] then consists in replacing a single infectious stage with K identical exponentially distributed sub-stages, each having a mean period 1/(K\u03b3). These multiple stages of infection can be used to represent periods of increased or decreased risk of transmitting the disease (Ma and Earn 2006) [37] . The same approach can be extended to models with multiple classes (Keeling and Grenfell 2002; Nguyen and Rojani 2008) [31, 43] , as well as non-exponentially distributed latency and temporary immunity periods (Blyuss and Kyrychko 2010; Wearing and Rojani 2005) [6, 50] . Figure 1 illustrates how the gamma distribution of infectious periods arises through the inclusion of multiple stages of infection. Following the methodology of introducing multi-stage of infection to better represent the distribution of infectious periods, we proceed with dividing the infected population into K identical stages I 1 , I 2 , . . . , I K to create the so-called SI K R model (Lloyd 2000) [35] , and we denote the total infected population by I = K i=1 I i . One should note that K\u03b3 is now used as the transition rate between successive infectious stages in order to keep the average ",

The importance of including not just the mean infectious period, but the actual distribution of infectious periods, as achieved by the system (1) is further highlighted by the inspection of actual values of epidemiological parameters for several real diseases as presented in Table 1 . This table illustrates that whilst the transmission rate and the average infectious period may vary between different diseases, in all of these cases the number of stages that has to be included in order to correctly represent the disease dynamics may also be quite high, this reinforces an earlier observation about the non-exponential nature of infectious period distribution. In this paper we analyse the dynamics of multi-stage infections with particular emphasis on considering explicit networks. The paper is organised as follows. The next Section contains a brief summary and discussion of earlier results on the properties of the SI K R model (1). In Section 3 we employ the framework of pairwise approximations to derive a multi-stage infection pairwise model and use this to derive analytical expressions for the probability of transmission of infection along an infected edge in a network, a threshold parameter controlling the onset of epidemic outbreaks, and the final size of an epidemic. In Section 4 numerical simulations of the pairwise and the full network models are performed using realistic parameter values from Table 1 to investigate the accuracy of pairwise approximation and to illustrate the role played by the number of stages in the multi-stage distribution in the disease dynamics. The paper concludes in Section 5 with discussion of results and future outlook.",

Ma and Earn (2006) [37] have recently discussed various aspects related to the derivation and validity of formula (3), and Andreasen (2011) [3] has studied the effects of population heterogeneity on the size of epidemic. A major implication of the above results is the fact that inclusion of possibly more realistic gamma distribution of infectious periods does not alter the threshold of an epidemic outbreak, nor does it affect the final epidemic size. We see that in Fig. 2 the three curves show that considering multi-stage infectious periods has a significant effect of the dynamics of the epidemic. In order to get a better understanding of the distinction in the dynamics of SIR and SI K R models, it is therefore instructive to look at the development of epidemics. Figure 3 illustrates early dynamics of epidemic outbreaks in the case of different numbers of stages; in each case the exponential curves were fitted, which provide an accurate approximation for the initial growth rate of the infection. In the standard SIR model, an outbreak can only take place if R 0 > 1, and at the initial stage, the number of infected individuals can be approximated as I(t) \u2248 I(0) exp(\u03bbt), where the growth rate is \u03bb = \u03b3(R 0 \u2212 1). In the case of a multi-stage SI K R model, however, the basic reproduction number R 0 does not depend on the number of stages, hence, it cannot by itself be used to determine the exponential growth rate during an early stage of an outbreak. For this model Wearing et al. (2005) [50] have derived the following relation between the basic reproduction number R 0 and the initial growth rate \u03bb",

            "text": "Modelling complex contact patterns explicitly via networks and considering epidemic dynamics spreading on networks has completely revitalised mathematical epidemiology. This new modelling framework has led to a myriad of models ranging from exact to mean-field and simulation models [44, 12, 29, 41, 7] . The many degrees of freedom in modelling offered by networks however, often comes at the price of increasing levels of complexity, where models can be challenging to evaluate analytically and sometimes even numerically. Nevertheless, many valuable paradigm models have been developed which have furthered our understanding of the impact of contact heterogeneity, preferential mixing and clustering on the outbreak threshold and other epidemic descriptors. A particularly useful way of capturing epidemic dynamics on networks is by using the pairwise model (Keeling 1999) [28] . This model is based around deriving in a hierarchical way evolution equations for the expected number of nodes, edges, triples and so on. A closure is then employed that curtails the dependence on ever higher order moments. Its premise is simple and quite intuitive, although it can be also shown rigorously (Taylor et al. 2012 ) [48] that pairwise models before closure are exact. The basic idea of the model is to recognise that changes at node level depend on the status of the neighbours and thus involves edges, e.g. the rate of change in the number of infectious nodes is proportional to the number of S \u2212 I links in the network. Similarly, the number of edges can change due to pair interactions and transitions but also due to interactions induced from outside the edge, e.g. the number of S \u2212 S links decrease proportionally to the number of S \u2212 S \u2212 I triples, where infection from the I node destroys the fully susceptible pair. This framework has been used and extended extensively, to asymmetric (Sharkey et al. 2006 ) [47] and weighted networks (Rattana et al. 2013 ) [45] for example, and has proved to be a valuable framework.",

The particular strength of pairwise models lies in their analytical tractability and the fact that they provide a more accurate description than well-mixed ODE models but do not go to the level of full individual-based stochastic simulations (House and Keeling 2011a) [24] . In this formalism of pairwise models, notations [X], [XY ] and [XY Z] are used to denote the expected numbers of individuals in state X, the expected number of links between nodes of type X and Y and the expected number of triples of the form X \u2212 Y \u2212 Z, respectively.

In fact, this saturation at higher K is observed not only in the probability of transmission, but also in the peak prevalence rate, as well as in the early growth rate. When compared to an exponential distribution, it is these substantial changes in\u03c4 observed for smaller values of K that explain the changes in the profile of the infection curves.

In the case K = 1 these two values are equivalent, thus we have perfect agreement with the existing theory. An equivalent relation has been derived for a static configuration network model with an arbitrary degree distribution (Miller 2012) [40] . Figure 5 illustrates Theorem 1 by showing how the final size of an epidemic on a network depends on the number of infectious stages and, hence, the shape of the distribution of infectious period, which makes it different from earlier analytical results for a well-mixed population (Ma and Earn 2006) [37] . This suggests that inclusion of a more realistic population structure has effect not only on the intermediate disease dynamics, but also on the final proportion of the population that will be affected by the disease. Furthermore, this Figure suggests that for the same mean infectious period, the final size of an epidemic is increasing with the increasing number of stages K. One should note that the number of stages K has the largest effect on the final size of an epidemic for sufficiently low values of K, and then this dependence saturates. As expected, the average node degree n plays an important role, with the minimum value of \u03c4 or K required for an epidemic outbreak decreasing with increasing n in perfect agreement with an earlier result in Eq. (11). Stochastic simulations (not shown) demonstrate excellent agreement with the results in Fig. 5 , especially for denser networks.

Several papers have modelled the effectiveness of smallpox when used as a bio-weapon, as well strategies for its containment during possible outbreaks (Ferguson et al. 2003; Kaplan Craft and Wein 2002; Meltzer et al. 2001 ) [20, 27, 39] . Due to a profound impact smallpox has had on a human population over several centuries, an extensive and quite accurate data has been collected about its transmission. Smallpox is spread through a contact with the mucus of an infected individual, which implies that a close contact is essential for a successful disease transmission. In Fig. 7 we show the simulations of smallpox outbreaks on homogeneous and Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks using parameter values from Table 1 compared to results of the numerical solution of the corresponding pairwise model (5) . The first important observation that the higher severity of epidemics outbreaks as suggested by these data makes the pairwise model more accurate, as expected. The effect of including the realistic distribution of infectious period is more pronounced in this case as compared to the SARS simulations, which can be attributed to the fact that smallpox model includes four stages of infection, while the SARS model had only three stages. Despite changes in the intermediate behaviour for smallpox being more pronounced compared to SARS, the final size of an epidemic as given by the pairwise model only increases from 96.34% to 97.89%, which is consistent with an earlier observation that the effect of increasing the number of stages on the final epidemic size is less noticeable for higher K. Figure 8 illustrates the comparison of a pairwise model (5) with the closure (6) and a stochastic simulation on the example of influenza data with different number of stages of infection. Comparison of figures (a) and (b) shows that the heterogeneity introduced by the degree distribution makes the pairwise model less accurate due to the fact that this model only takes into account the mean degree n. This suggests that whilst our model is very helpful for understanding general features of multi-stage disease dynamics on networks, it has to be extended further to deal effectively with wider and more realistic node degree distributions. One should note that the effects of increasing the number of stages on peak prevalence and the duration of epidemics reduce for higher values of K, as can be observed by comparing the minor changes between temporary profiles of the threeand five-stage influenza epidemics presented as shown in Fig. 8 .",

Unlike the well-mixed models, for which the number of stages modifies the temporary profile of an outbreak but does not affect the final epidemic size or the condition for disease outbreak, in the case of disease spread on a network, the number of stages, i.e. the precise distribution of infectious period, plays a much more prominent role.",

This has allowed us to determine the probability of disease transmission across a network edge, find an R 0 -like threshold that controls the onset of epidemics, as well as derive an analytical expression for the final size of an epidemic. All of these quantities depend not only on the basic disease characteristics, such as, the transmission rate and the average infectious period, but also on the distribution of the infectious period as represented by the number of stages in the model. The importance of this result lies in the fact that unlike earlier studies of multi-stage models in well-mixed populations (Anderson and Watson 1980; Ma and Earn 2006) [2, 37] , for the same average duration of the infection period, the final epidemic size is not constant but increasing with the number of stages. Numerical simulations of epidemic outbreak for several different multi-stage infections demonstrate that while the pairwise model provides a reasonably good approximation of the network dynamics, the agreement with stochastic simulations is affected by inhomogeneity in the node degree distribution, as should be expected from the fact that the pairwise closure only depends on the average node degree.",

These include the analysis of SIS and SEIR models, as well as inclusion of multiple stages for both the latent and infected classes (Nguyen and Rojani 2008) [43] . Another interesting and important problem would be the consideration of network dynamics for epidemic models with temporary im- munity (Blyuss and Kyrychko 2010) [6] . Allowing the level of infectiousness of different nodes to vary depending on the stage of infection they belong to would result in even more realistic models of multi-stage diseases on networks. One of the challenging but practically important generalisations of the present framework would be an extension of a pairwise model that would account for heterogeneity in node degree distribution (House and Keeling 2011a) [24] . This would provide deterministic models potentially amenable to analytical treatment that would more accurately represent stochastic disease dynamics.",
