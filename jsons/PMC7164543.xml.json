These functions are not discussed in detail in the current review, but they may be mentioned when they are germane to the discussion. Also, the functions of melatonin in plants [18, 61, 62, 194] are not considered even though many of those actions have been widely investigated in recent years and these studies reveal that the actions of melatonin in plants are equally ubiquitous as its functions in animals.",

Given the critical role of mitochondria in normal and pathological cellular function, the localization of melatonin in this organelle has broad implications for organ health and organismal well-being. For example, apoptosis and autophagy are important cellular processes that determine tissue architecture and organ physiology. Additional processes considered in this review are the role of melatonin in the regulation of epigenetics and of ubiquitin and proteasomal function. Finally, excessive deposits of collagen and extracellular matrix, accumulations collectively referred to as fibrosis, is a reflection of dysregulated cellular function which has severe negative consequences in a number of organs required for survival. This article by no means exhausts the large number of interactions melatonin has at the subcellular level.",

What was initially reported was that melatonin preserved the activities of mitochondrial complex I and IV in rats treated with the mitochondrial toxin, ruthenium red [153]; this toxin hinders the function of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter which leads to the excessive production of damaging free radicals in these organelles. When toxin-treated animals were also given melatonin, but not when they were treated with either vitamin E or vitamin C, the activities of the complexes were preserved; the toxin in this case was t-butyl hydroperoxide [154]. While the conserved mitochondrial function was consistent with melatonin\u2019s discovery as an antioxidant [187], the failure of vitamin C or E, molecules which also function as radical scavengers, is left unexplained. Perhaps the vitamins did not localize in sufficient amounts in the mitochondria to combat the large amounts of free radicals produced.",

Shortly after the studies of Martin et al. [153\u2013155], Okatani et al.

That melatonin can quickly gain access to mitochondria was immunocytochemically verified by Jou et al. [109]. When rat brain astrocytes were incubated in medium containing the oxidizing agent, H2O2, their mitochondria quickly exhibited intense fluorescence due to ROS generation. However, when mitochondria were incubated with H2O2 and melatonin, the extreme mitochondrial fluorescent reaction that was associated with H2O2 only was quenched. Like Martin et al. [154], Jou and co-workers [109] also found that vitamin E was significantly less effective than melatonin in reducing ROS-mediated mitochondrial fluorescence. The differences in the efficacies of melatonin versus vitamin E at the mitochondrial level were also apparent when the apoptotic indices of the astrocytes were compared; thus, melatonin was more efficacious in limiting mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis than was vitamin E. Jou et al. [110, 111] extended the evidence related to the functional preservation of mitochondria when they found that intracellular calcium dysregulation, mitochondrial transition pore opening, cardiolipin depletion and, cytochrome c release were attenuated in astrocytes challenged by oxidizing situations but not when treated with melatonin.",

Contrary to expectations, they observed very wide differences in the melatonin concentrations in different portions of the cells.

Considering this finding and the alleged origin of both chloroplasts and mitochondria from bacteria that were ingested as food by early eukaryotes (Endosymbiotic Theory), we [244] proposed that melatonin initially evolved in bacteria several billion years ago and when they were ingested and developed into mitochondria in eukaryotes, they retained their melatonin-forming ability.",

In the absence of available serotonin, no melatonin was formed. Meanwhile, Suofu et al.

As with He et al. [82], when they incubated neurally-derived mitochondria with serotonin, these organelles formed melatonin and melatonin metabolites. Unlike melatonin production in the pineal gland, brain mitochondria did not exhibit a day:night rhythm in mitochondria consistent with the findings of Venegas et al. [256].

Alternatively, it was recently suggested that melatonin is actively transferred into cells through the glucose transporter, GLUT1 [84]. Huo et al.

This involves the mediation of ULK1/FIP200/ATG101/ATG13 protein kinase and VPS34/beclin1/VPS15/ATG14 lipid kinase complexes. Both complexes induce the formation of the ATG5/ATG12/ATG16L1 complex (formed with the help of Atg7 and Atg10), which promotes the elongation of the phagophore engulfing a portion of the cytosol or specific cargoes (proteins, lipids, organelles), forming a double-membrane-bound vacuole called the autophagosome. Aided by Atg3 and Atg7, these complexes facilitate the addition of a phosphatidylethanolamine group to the cytosolic form of mammalian LC3 homologues (LC3A, LC3B, LC3C, Gabarap, Gabarap-L1, and Gabarap-L2), which is referred to as the LC3-I to LC3- II conversion. The lipid-bound form of LC3 homologues is then recruited to the autophagosome, which fuses with a lysosome, forming a single-membrane-bound vesicle termed the autolysosome. Several lysosomal membrane proteins (GTPase RAB7, LAMP1, LAMP2, as well as SNARE proteins, such as syntaxin 17 and SNAP29) degraded the contents with the aid of another beclin1/VPS34 complex, where the UV radiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG), rather than Atg14, is required [129].",

The protective role of melatonin in the regulation of autophagy has been reported in several of neurodegenerative diseases. Parkinson disease is characterized by the aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons causing gradual degeneration of certain brain regions. The protective role of melatonin via autophagic processes in experimental models of Parkinson disease has been reported [2]. Thus, the exposure of glial cell type C6 or mouse striatal cells to 1-methyl-4- phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) provokes in increase of LC3-II, mediated by upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), inducing \u03b1-synuclein aggregation, which is reduced by pretreatment of mice with melatonin [230]. Rotenone, a Parkinson disease inducer, promoted autophagic cell death mediated by Bax and Omi release into the cytoplasm. A decrease in the expression of Bax and a drop in the release of Omi into the cytoplasm, as well as reduced cell death, was observed in Hela cells pre-treated with melatonin [288]. Another Parkinson disease inducer, kainic acid, increased \u03b1-synuclein and the level of LC3-II and promoted neuronal loss in the hippocampus of mice. Melatonin enhanced \u03b1-synuclein ubiquitination and reduced LC3-II, cathepsin B and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2) [36].",

Also, the reduced autophagosome-lysosome fusion and inhibition of lysosomal function triggered by cadmium intake is reversed by treatment with melatonin in mouse neuroblastoma cells [138, 139]. Oxaliplatin, which is a chemotherapeutic agent widely used in the treatment of different cancers, induces neuropathy as a secondary effect. Oxaliplatin-treated rats showed impaired autophagy with basal levels of LC3A/3B-I and II, beclin, Atg3, Atg5, and Atg7 being attenuated in the sciatic nerve and dorsal root ganglia. An increase of these autophagic proteins was observed in melatonin-treated rats [17].",

Diabetic cardiomyopathy is considered a major cause of heart failure. In melatonin-treated diabetic animals, adverse left ventricle remodeling was alleviated and cardiac dysfunction was reduced by enhanced Sirt1 expression and reduction of Mst1, which have pivotal roles in autophagy induction [281\u2013283]. Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), which occurs during obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), causes multiple cardiovascular disorders such as coronary heart disease, hypertension and myocardial hypertrophy [72]. A higher LC3II/I ratio and greater Beclin1 expression in myocardial tissue of rats with CIH-induced myocardial hypertrophy suggest an increased autophagic response. Administration of melatonin induced additional autophagy via activation of AMPK, thereby having a protective effect in CIH rats [269]. Doxorubicin (DXR), which is an important chemotherapeutic agent, causes cardiotoxicity as a major side effect. Increased autophagy, which is upregulated during DXR-induced cardiotoxicity, is concomitant with a lower cell death [224]. The deteriorative effects of DXR on mitochondria are reduced by melatonin in an experimental model of cardiorenal syndrome; in this situation, melatonin reversed the drop in ATP production and inhibited cytochrome c release from mitochondria. It appears that melatonin has significant protective effect by modulating mitophagy, a process that removes damaged mitochondria through autophagy [42].",

Melatonin also induces the autophagic pathway in tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line, Cal 27, as evidenced by the upregulation of LC3-II and downregulation of SQSTM1/P62 [61]. Valproic acid (VA) inhibits invasiveness of bladder cancer. When combined with melatonin, VA exhibits enhanced autophagy by triggering several autophagic genes including Beclin1, Atg3 and Atg5 [143].

This dual effect of ROS on apoptosis suggests an explanation of the actions of melatonin on the programmed cell death type since a major function of melatonin is as an antioxidant.

Similarly, melatonin reduces oxidative stress and hepatic apoptosis promoted by ethanol administration [165, 177]. In both cases, scavenging of ROS may be the major explanation for its anti-apoptotic effects. Moreover, melatonin is also efficient in the prevention of apoptosis by acting through its MT2 membrane receptor [218] in bile duct-ligated young rats or inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress, a process that often induces apoptosis [53] in leptin-deficient mice. Similar mechanisms of protection are shown when melatonin reverses bone loss due to its antioxidant actions that prevent anti-apoptotic events [147].",

Several articles have confirmed that this coincidence is not accidental, with the loss of melatonin being related to aggravation or an increase in the incidence of the ailment [13, 169]. Thus, during aging, the drop in the nocturnal melatonin peak is associated with a rise in bone resorption, suggesting that melatonin may act as an endogenous osteoclast inhibitor [178]. Melatonin has been shown to limit bone resorption by limiting osteoclastogenesis [88, 127]. Since the osteoclastic actions involve apoptosis, melatonin indirectly inhibits cell death [152].",

This mechanism involves neither membrane receptors (MT1, MT2) nor melatonin\u2019s antioxidant effect. This action involves the ubiquitination of target proteins in the apoptosis pathway, which is a usual mechanism that reduces Bcl-2 proteins and regulates apoptosis [264]. In porcine granulosa cells, melatonin limits BimEL, ubiquitinating it so it can be degraded by the proteasome [114]. This latter action not only identifies a new action of melatonin, but also may help to explain the differential behavior of melatonin in normal cells and cancer cells. In cancer cells, melatonin has been described as a potent proteasome inhibitor [258, 259]. Although many of the studies that show an inhibitory role of melatonin on apoptosis in normal cells may lack detailed mechanisms, the anti-apoptotic effect of melatonin deserves to be studied in greater detail considering the significant therapeutic repercussions that its use would imply.",

Moreover, it is rich in easily-oxidizable polyunsaturated fatty acids and endowed with relatively low levels of endogenous antioxidants [147, 191]. This makes it a clear target in which to examine the role of antioxidants on apoptosis. Melatonin has been shown in multiple studies to be a highly effective neuroprotective agent not only in neurodegenerative diseases [206, 266, 281\u2013283], but also after brain injury [147]. These protective actions are related to the functions of melatonin as an antioxidant and anti-apoptotic actions. In mice, melatonin may protect against ischemic stroke via an action on MT2 receptors [40]. During brain ischemia-reperfusion, melatonin reduces upregulation of Nox2 and Nox4 expression, enhancing its anti-apoptotic capacity [137]. Anti-apoptotic actions of melatonin, mediated by membrane receptors, are not confined to brain damage but also have been observed under neurobehavioral dysfunctions [265, 280].",

Melatonin administration reduces calpain gene expression, caspase-3 activity and, thereby, neuronal death in animals with spinal cord injury [209]. Methamphetamine is a neurotoxic molecule that causes neuronal apoptosis and activates glial cells in the central nervous system. It functions to reduce cell viability by depleting calpastatin levels which upregulate calpains and caspases [241]. Melatonin reverses the depletion of calpastatin and improves mitochondrial dysfunction thereby lowering cell death by reducing apoptosis [234, 235].

In human hexokinase 2 (HK2) cells, an immortalized proximal tubule epithelial cell line, melatonin counteracts the deleterious effects of cisplatin, inducing its anti-apoptotic actions [281\u2013283]. Only a few reports have identified the intermediate events in this process. ERK, through a melatonin receptor- independent process, seems to be involved [145, 249]. Also, the regulation of expression BAX/Bcl-2 ratio and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential have been observed [266]. MT1 and MT2 melatonin membrane-receptor may not be related to these anti-apoptotic effects of melatonin in different types of stem cells. Clearly, additional detailed reports related to the cellular mechanisms by which melatonin modulates apoptosis during stem cell-based therapy are required.",

A fairly well documented connection between melatonin and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in the modulation of the synthesis and degradation of the rate limiting enzyme involved in melatonin production, AANAT (arylalkylamine N- acetyltransferase), by ubiquitin ligases in the pineal gland has been documented [120]. The regulation of AANAT synthesis in the pineal gland by its adrenergic innervation and the cAMP/PKA pathway has been described in detail [89, 120, 121]. These investigations reported the rapid decrease in AANAT protein induced by L-propranolol was blocked by proteasome inhibitors [68]. They concluded that the rapid drop in AANAT protein and AANAT activity induced by light exposure or propranolol administration was due to proteasomal degradation of AANAT. Additional data documenting a rise in AANAT in the pineal gland after administration of proteasome inhibitors was reported by Huang et al. [100]. These investigators also pointed out that stabilization of AANAT protein was regulated by phosphorylation and by interaction with a 14-3-3 protein.",

Based on studies of the ubiquitin ligase Praja2, Lignitto et al. [140] found that Praja2 interacts directly with the regulatory component of PKA. Based on this data, Vriend et al. [263] included Praja2 in a model of AANAT control in the pineal gland. Considering the complexity of control mechanisms of AANAT, it is reasonable to speculate that more than one ubiquitin ligase is involved in regulation of AANAT degradation and transcription. Since CREB is a transcription factor involved in the transcription of AANAT [223, 257] the ubiquitin ligase CREBBP (CREB binding protein) would be a reasonable protein to investigate for its potential in regulating AANAT transcription. It was first isolated as a protein that binds to the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) [41]. The p65 component of NF-kB is reported to bind to CREBBP (aka CBP) [271].",

While it cannot be assumed that melatonin and proteasome inhibitors are equally effective, the similarities provide an interesting model for investigating the \u2018pleiotropic\u2019 effects of melatonin administration [221]. One explanation for the similarities of the actions of melatonin to that of proteasome inhibitors include the possibility that melatonin itself acts as a proteasome inhibitor or that it indirectly influences the UPS via an effect on phosphorylation of key proteins of the UPS [258, 259]. Other explanations may arise as research in this area develops.",

Further data was obtained by two separate research groups [10, 219]. Shi et al. [219] reported that melatonin inhibited the formation of the phosphorylated form of IkB\u03b1, but not the non- phosphorylated from of IkB\u03b1 in a cell line stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In a study of exercise in rats on NF-kB, Alonso et al noted that phosphorylated IkB\u03b1 and IKK in muscle cells increased with exercise; the increase in both was prevented by melatonin [10]. Their data suggested that melatonin inhibited degradation of phosphorylated IkB\u03b1 indirectly by inhibiting the activity of IKK. If IKK is the key to NF-kB activation, as suggested by Karin and Ben-Neriah [115], it could also be the key to understanding the mechanisms of melatonin in NF-kB activation. Since IKK\u03b2 is a substrate of the ubiquitin ligase Keap1 complex and is responsible for its ubiquitination [132, 250, 251], we suggest that the interaction of Keap1 and IKK may contribute to the mechanism by which melatonin administration activates NF-kB.",

As noted, proteasome inhibitors also stimulate the activity of these enzymes. The components of the antioxidant stress response have been well described. They include the Keap1 ubiquitin ligase complex and the NRF2-antioxidant response element pathway. We reviewed the evidence that the antioxidant action of melatonin involves the Keap1-NRF2-ARE pathway in 2015 [260, 261]. We speculated that one possible mechanism that would explain the stimulation of antioxidant enzymes by melatonin was inhibition of the proteasome.

Damaging fibrosis is most commonly reported in the lung [203], heart [169], liver [104], and kidney [172] but it occurs in other situations where inflammation is rampant [94] as well as in the form of adhesions [14] among organs after surgical intervention, infection, oxidative stress, etc. Whereas there is some evidence that fibrosis may be reversible, particularly in the early stages, advanced fibrosis is associated with end stage disease, organ failure and death. To overcome the latter two events, the only available treatment is organ transplantation. Initially, fibrosis is a physiological reparative process but, when it continues to expand, it becomes pathological and life threatening (Fig. 6). Thus, limiting the sustained development of pro-fibrotic processes is medically critical.",

The latter process may be the result of a different events such as ischemia/reperfusion injury, toxin exposure, ionizing radiation damage, etc. Dysfunctional epithelial cells and inflammatory cells, following their recruitment to the site of injury, become fibrosis-initiator cells, which transform and actively proliferate. These activated cells include fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and other collagen-generating elements that are derived from organ-specific cells that undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. In some organs there are other cells that contribute collagen and extracellular matrix deposition, e.g., stellate cells of the liver [238].",

Of special interest is that melatonin membrane receptors (MT1 and MT2) are widely expressed on fibroblasts in developing scar tissue. In contrast, fibroblasts derived from skin dermal tissue lack melatonin receptors. These findings suggest that, at least in part and under some conditions, melatonin probably controls the activity of hyperfunctional fibroblasts/myofibroblasts via receptor-mediated mechanisms [97]. Given the high damaging reactive oxygen species generation by inflammatory cells and cells crippled by ironizing radiation, drugs, etc., melatonin\u2019s receptor-independent actions may also be involved in suppressing the development of fibrosis [66, 80]. For example, melatonin limits the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of lung cells exposed to bleomycin [286] and during leptin-mediated fibrosis in the heart [157].",

The respiratory system is a frequent site of fibrotic diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The damaging culprit in these conditions is often cigarette smoke. Experimentally, the regular administration of melatonin to animals exposed daily to cigarette smoke (see below) or to bleomycin [21] curtailed the severity of alveolar destruction as indicted by the amounts of oxidatively damaged protein and lipid in the lungs. In a preliminary blinded, placebo-controlled study in children with cystic fibrosis (CF), melatonin improved their wellbeing indicating it may have some benefit in individuals with this debilitating condition [54].",

In the first of these, Shin and coworkers [220] performed both in vivo and in vitro studies to identify the molecular mechanisms by which melatonin blunts fibrosis. For the in vivo test, rats were exposed to cigarette smoke daily for a week and treated with lipopolysaccharide intravenously with or without daily melatonin treatment. At the conclusion of the study (on day 7), the non-melatonin treated rats had high numbers of inflammatory cells in their bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) and an elevated expression of TGF-\u03b21, collagen I and Smad3 in their lung tissues. In a dose-response manner, melatonin inhibited each of the parameters. The in vitro study utilized a human mucoepithelial cell line treated with cigarette smoke condensate (SSC). This treatment caused an elevated expression of not only TGF-\u03b21 and collagen I, but also tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and Smad 3 and p38 phosphorylation. As in the animals study, each of the indices related to fibrosis was suppressed when melatonin was added to the incubation medium.",

The synthesis of melatonin in the mitochondrial matrix is also shown, a pathway that is aided by the ready availability of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA); acetyl CoA is a co-factor for the activity of the acetyltransferase enzyme (SNAT/AANAT). Locally-produced melatonin may diffuse out of the mitochondria and interact with melatonin membrane receptors (MT1/MT2) on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). By means of this action, melatonin may regulate cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase activation. Within mitochondria, melatonin scavenges reactive oxygen species and stimulates the antioxidative enzyme, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), a pathway that involves SIRT3 and FOXO3a. Also, melatonin protects against the deterioration of oxidative phosphorylation (CI- CV) and enhances ATP production. By reducing mitochondrial oxidation dyshomeostasis, melatonin reduces the oxidation of cardiolipin and limits cytochrome c release. Melatonin also regulates the opening of the mitochondria transition pore directly and via an action on uncoupling protein (UCP). For many of these functions, additional data are required before these actions can be identified as being definitive.

The third one leads to protein destruction through the proteasome.
