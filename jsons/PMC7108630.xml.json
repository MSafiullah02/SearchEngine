            "text": "Many previous studies have explored how health literacy affects patients with chronic illness. Low literacy is associated with adverse health outcomes and is common, especially in elderly patients. Poor health status is more closely associated with low health literacy than with education, income, ethnic background or any other variables. In addition, patients with low health literacy may become ill or be hospitalized more frequently than patients with high or adequate health literacy [1]. The relationship between low health literacy and illness has been supported in studies about acute and chronic diseases, which show that health literacy skills have a direct impact on health status outcomes [4]. The ability to read is, all by itself, a predictor of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death among the elderly. Reading fluency is a more powerful variable than education for examining the association between socioeconomic status and health. Chang et al. [13] posited a relationship between health literacy and two outcome measurements: knowledge and prevention behavior. The most recent study by Kim and Lee [14] concluded that diabetes management that is sensitive to health literacy is more effective in reducing HbA1c levels in patients. All evidence indicates that health literacy can have a strong impact on patient care. The more literate the patient, the better he or she will take care of himself or herself. Health literacy is an independent variable in this study.",

The search was done from October 2014 till June 2015 and the list of search terms is listed in Table 1. We eventually pared down the selection from 145 papers to 14. These 14 papers met our inclusion criteria which were: (i) the topic must be either health literacy or e-health literacy, (ii) the paper must have been cited three or more times and (iii) all 14 papers were included in systematic reviews by Ishikawa et al., AlSayah and Boren [8, 15, 17]. The AlSayah et al.'s paper [15] included all the gold standards in health literacy such as Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA), Rapid Estimates of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), Single Item Literacy Scales (SILS) and Newest Vital Signs (NVS). We also looked at the most recent publications by AlSayah et al. [15] and current papers on e-health literacy such as Watkins [17]. We revisited Health Literacy Skills Instruments (HLSI) [18] and the e-health literacy scale (e-heals) [19] to understand e-health literacy in depth. We decided that we could not use the e-heals scale because it only looks at literacy on the Internet, and because most e-heals work must be accompanied by an IT skills test [17, 20, 21]. Therefore, the e-heals scale was deemed unsuitable for the Saudi nationwide study.\n",

The process of selecting dimensions, extracting items and scales, and assembling a SeHL is illustrated in Figure 1. The workshop attendees were health informatics professionals, health educators and clinicians. A matrix (Table 1) was created to extract the dimensions used in each paper. As we tried to match the papers with the dimensions, we found that some overlapping concepts were used in similar ways; thus, similar concepts were merged into single dimensions. For example, under \u2018Decision Making,\u2019 we found four areas: Understanding, Usefulness, Remembering and Communication. Communication was further subdivided into pronunciation and verbalization, reading comprehension, numeracy, decision making, confidence, health-information seeking, navigation and need for assistance.",

We then list all the related items and scales, and conducted another workshop to clarify the meanings of the items in each category. During this workshop, we also revisited the reasons behind SeHL. We considered the following: how patients sought information, how well they understood it, how useful the information was, how comfortable patients were with new health information, and how they used media and technology for health information. The research group felt that it was important that the logistics of collecting data be straightforward and that the scale be easy to be read. It was presented in a language simple enough to suit the culture and context of our study (Table 2).\n",

We did this by reviewing previous studies in health literacy and e-health literacy and by conducting workshops to propose a new scale suitable for measuring e-health literacy levels among the Saudi population. This study may later be extended to other Arabic-speaking countries, in which no e-health literacy research has been previously done.

The World Fact Website states that basic literacy (reading and writing) levels in Saudi Arabia are 87% (compared to the United States with 99%). However, e-health literacy\u2014defined as the ability to read, write and understand health information using the Internet and other IT\u2014is only 8% in the USA [10]. No other nation has reported its e-health literacy at the population level. The development of SeHL will contribute to our knowledge of e-health literacy as it relates to NCDs in the Saudi population. The national study that will be conducted in Saudi Arabia can help determine the prevalence of e-health literacy among patients with NCD. In terms of the public health field, this e-health literacy research can help organization build a better patient education system that would promote prevention of NCDs.",
