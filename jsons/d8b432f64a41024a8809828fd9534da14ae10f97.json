The management of perioperative antibiotic therapy is a major issue, but little is known about worldwide practices. Methods: We sent by email a survey dealing with 5 daily clinical vignettes concerning perioperative antibiotic therapy to 180 LTx centers around the world. The invitation and a weekly reminder were sent to lung transplant specialists for a single consensus answer per center during a 3-month period. Results: We received a total of 99 responses from 24 countries, mostly from Western Europe (n = 46) and the USA (n = 34). Systematic screening for bronchial recipient colonization before LTx was mostly performed with sputum samples (72%), regardless of the underlying lung disease. In recipients without colonization, antibiotics with activity against gram-negative bacteria resistant strains (piperacillin / tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, carbapenems) were reported in 72% of the centers, and antibiotics with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (mainly vancomycin) were reported in 38% of the centers. For these recipients, the duration of antibiotics reported was 7 days (33%) or less (26%) or stopped when cultures of donor and recipients were reported negatives (12%). In recipients with previous colonization, antibiotics were adapted to the susceptibility of the most resistant strain and given for at least 14 days (67%). Conclusion: Practices vary widely around the world, but resistant bacterial strains are mostly targeted even if no colonization occurs. The antibiotic duration reported was longer for colonized recipients.",

After general questions on local practices, we asked each center for their diagnostic methods for microbial screening in recipients and donors. The clinical cases were related to specific issues concerning the management of antibiotic therapy in different clinical situations, including no prior colonization, prior colonization with MDR microorganisms (defined as non-susceptibility to at least 1 agent in 3 or more antimicrobial categories) [17] , colonization definition, local tuberculoid granuloma in the lung explant, and prior colonization with MDR bacteria not susceptible to beta-lactams (complete survey in Additional file 1, raw answer data in Additional file 2).

It is still debated whether MDR bacteria are more problematic than wild-type agents. Recently, a study from the ISHLT registry demonstrated a similar survival rate in cystic fibrosis lung transplant recipients infected with organisms labeled pan-resistant despite more infection episodes [8] . Although, in this study, there are no precise data about the bacterial species or the antibiotic treatments, most of the centers did not consider MDR bacteria a contraindication to transplantation, except in the context of pan-resistance, which is still considered at higher risk. For some species like Burkholderia cenocepacia many studies reported an increased mortality after LTx and for that reason, this colonization has been considered a contraindication in some centers [38] [39] [40] . Aguado et al. [41] recently recommended that MDR bacteria should not constitute a contraindication to transplantation but highlighted the importance of characterizing the isolate's phenotypic and genotypic resistance profile to better guide treatment.",

Some respondents (mainly surgeons) were not in charge of antibiotic management, and thus, in those cases, the answers might maybe not reflect the real practice of these centers. The question of the survey is complex and the practice varies widely from one center to another. Thus it was really challenging to cover all aspects of the problematic and in order not to make the questions too long, we sometimes limited the choice of answers and certain situations may have been neglected. For instance, the route of administration was not always specified when asking for an antibiotic strategy. Moreover, not all 180 centers contacted have responded to the survey, but we received a global response rate of 55%. The response rate from Western Europe was the highest (62%), but some countries with experience in LTx, such as the United Kingdom and Germany, did not participate well in the survey (33 and 27%, respectively). We received no answer from China. Because we did not screen centers in advance for eligibility, it is likely that some of the nonresponders would have been ineligible (because they do not perform LTx). Furthermore, some centers may be not used to complex infectious situations since most centers perform LTx for fibrosis (61%) and may not be used to cystic fibrosis, which entails a more complex risk.",
