It is inconclusive as to whether transmission from the pregnant woman to the fetus exists in COVID-19 [5, 6]. Undoubtedly, the risk of mother-to-child transmission, whether during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding, is one of many clinical questions to be answered in relation to modes of transmission. There are other emerging questions that require special attention, for example, whether SARS-CoV-2 disproportionally cause severe illness and death in pregnant and postpartum women, similar to what we observed during other outbreaks causing severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), where evidence raised questions but provided very few answers [7, 8]. Is infection during pregnancy associated with increased risk of fetal demise and medium-to-long-term adverse infant outcomes? Does infection at different stages of pregnancy influence the severity of disease progression and the reproductive outcomes, for example in future pregnancies? The presence and persistence of the virus in bodily fluids including amniotic fluid and breastmilk is still unanswered as well as the underlying risk of sexual transmission or transmission from the woman to the health care provider during delivery.",

These scenarios are similar to what we observed for the Zika and Ebola outbreaks [15], and could be expected during the COVID-19 pandemic across different countries. As was noted during Zika epidemic in Puerto Rico, when quality contraceptive services were made available and accessible, the use of contraceptives to prevent unintended pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes due to prenatal exposure, increased [16]. It would be valuable to track how long it will take for the utilization of essential SRH services to return to their pre-outbreak levels once COVID-19 has become largely controlled. There is evidence that during the 2014\u20132015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa the utilization of family planning, antenatal care and institutional deliveries declined and did not fully recover to pre-outbreak levels for 6 months [17, 18].",
