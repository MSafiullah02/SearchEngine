After entering the body, the rabies virus travels quickly along the neural pathways to the noncentral nervous system, from there the virus further spreads to other organs and causes morbidity by intruding many tissues. Infected individuals can experience incubation before showing symptoms. The incubation period of the disease is usually a few months, but can be as long as years, depending on the distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system. If the bitten location is near the head, the incubation is relatively shorter. The first symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu expressing fever or headache, progressing to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, fearing light and water within days. With the disease exacerbating, the infected individual may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, and insomnia (CDC 2010b). Once the rabies virus reaches the central nervous system and symptoms of the disease develop, the course of the disease is less than 10 days (CDC 2010b) and the mortality rate reaches up to 100%.",

Since 1950, human rabies has been classified as a class II infectious disease in the National Stationary Notifiable Communicable Diseases and the annual data of human rabies have been archived by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In the last 60 years (1950\u20132010) there had been 124,255 human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health (MOHC 2009, 2011), an average of 2,037 cases per year. However, the factors and mechanisms behind the persistence and prevalence of human rabies have not been well understood. Most recently, Zhang et al. (2011) developed a deterministic model to study the transmission dynamics of rabies in China. The model, consisted of susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered subpopulations of both dogs and humans and described by eight ordinary differential equations, was used to simulate the human rabies data from 1996 to 2010 reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health. It was shown that reducing dog birth rate and increasing dog immunization coverage rate are the most effective methods for controlling rabies in China and large scale culling of susceptible dogs can be replaced by immunization of them. Hou et al. (2012) proposed a similar dog\u2013human interaction model considering both domestic and wild dogs and used the model to simulate the rabies data from Guangdong Province, China. It was shown that the quantity of stray dogs also plays an important role in the transmission of rabies.",

We observe that the monthly data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health since January 2004 exhibit a periodic pattern on an annual base. The cases in the summer and autumn are significantly higher than in the spring and winter (MOHC 2009, 2011). Song et al. (2009) also reported that the main seasons for rabies epidemics in China are summer and fall. Moreover, the infected areas are mainly distributed in the south provinces such as Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Anhui, Fujian (Song et al. 2009), which demonstrates that rabies transmission depends on the weather.",

Seasonally effective contact rate (Dushoff et al. 2004; Schwartz 1992; Schwartz and Smith 1983; Smith 1983), periodic changing in the birth rate (Ma and Ma 2006) and vaccination program (Earn et al. 2000) are often regarded as sources of periodicity. In this paper, we take periodic transmission rate into account based on the following facts. (1) In the summer and fall, people wear light clothing and are lack of protection for the bites or scratches of dogs. Also, in summer and fall people, in particular farmers, have more frequent outdoor activities which increase the chance of human\u2013dog interaction. (2) In these seasons, dogs are more maniacal and apt to attack each other and humans. (3) From July to September schools are closed for summer vacations and children are out of supervision and enjoy tantalizing dogs. In fact, it was reported (Song et al. 2009) that 25.7% of human rabies cases in China are students and unattended children. (4) In addition, temperature may be related to the fluctuation of diseases. Under high temperature in summer, rabies virus can survive easily and its infectivity is stronger.",

The number of the initial susceptible human population at the end of 2003, S\n1(0), is obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook and the number of the initial infective humans I\n1(0) is from epidemiological bulletins published by the Chinese Ministry of Health. However, the numbers of the initial exposed humans E\n1(0) and the recovered humans R\n1(0) cannot be obtained. We derive E\n1(0) reversely by the parameter \u03b3 and R\n1(0) is estimated roughly. Regarding the initial values for dogs, we only know that there are about 75 millions dogs in 2009 from online news. So, S(0),E(0),I(0), and R(0) are calculated reversely by the corresponding parameters r\n1,k\n1 and data fitting. The numerical simulation of the model on the number of human rabies cases is shown in Fig. 2. We observe that the data of 2005, 2008 and 2009 are slightly different from the solution as observed in Zhang et al. (2011). We think this is because of large scale culling of dogs in these years.

We observe that R\n0 is a concave function of k from Fig. 7(b). So k has an obvious effect on R\n0. We also know that immunization is an effective measure to control rabies. Next, we consider the effect of \u03b3 on R\n0, which is depicted in Fig. 7(c). We can observe that it is linear in \u03b3. Most people, especially in the rural and remote areas, have little knowledge about rabies and even do not know what to do after being bitten by dogs. Song et al. (2009) reported that 66.3% of rabies victims did not seek medical services at all and 27.6% of the cases received inadequate PEP. Although the effect of \u03b3 on R\n0 is less than k, we can enhance people the awareness and knowledge about rabies and the emergency measure and treatment after they are bitten and scratched by dogs to decrease the rate of clinical outbreak of rabies.",

The data of human rabies cases reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health exhibit seasonal characteristics that the morbidity rates in the summer and autumn are much higher than in the winter and spring. In order to study the transmission dynamics of rabies in China, seasonality of the spreading of the rabies was incorporated into an SEIRS mathematic model with periodic transmission rates. Firstly, we calculated the basic reproduction number R\n0 (Diekmann et al. 1990) and analyzed the dynamics of the model including the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium and the existence of periodic solutions. R\n0 was calculated following the definition of Bacaer and Guernaoui (2006), namely R\n0=\u03c1(L), where L is the next infection operator, which has been employed in some other studies (Bai and Zhou 2011; Liu 2010; Liu et al. 2010; Nakata and Kuniya 2010; Wang and Zhao 2008; Zhang and Zhao 2007). In particular, Wang and Zhao (2008) generalized the techniques and results of van den Driessche and Watmough (2002) to periodic ODE models and provided a recipe to calculate the basic reproduction number. Their results also indicate that R\n0 is a threshold value for determining the local stability of the disease-free periodic solution. We then used our model to simulate the monthly data on the number of infected human cases from January 2004 to December 2010 in China reported by the Chinese Ministry of Health and predicted the general tendency of disease in China. Moreover, we carried out some sensitivity analysis of parameters on R\n0. The demographic data were estimated from National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC 2009). The values of most parameters in our model were obtained from the literature or by assumptions. The values of \u03b2(t), \u03b2\n1(t) and A were estimated through least-square fitting of I\n1(t\ni) by discretizing the ordinary differential system as in Chowell et al. (2006) and Stafford et al. (2000).",

(2011) estimated that the basic reproduction number R\n0=2, but in this paper, we calculated it to be 1.03 with similar model structure. This can be explained as follows. In Zhang et al. (2011), the data adopted by model fitting were from 1996 to 2010. In this paper we only used the data from 2004 to 2010. From Fig. 11, we can see that the numbers of infected human cases increased dramatically from 159 cases in 1996 and were fierce from 1996 to 2004. After 2004, the spread of rabies began to slow down. Moreover, the data in 2005 and after 2007 decreased. So the fact that R\n0 in this paper is less than in previous paper is reasonable. We also would like to calculate the basic reproduction number for the nonautonomous system from 1996 to 2010. However, we cannot obtain the monthly data before 2004 since only after the SARS outbreaks in 2003 the Chinese Ministry of Health began to publish monthly data on various infectious diseases. \n",

Moreover, the nonautonomous differential system is different from and better than the autonomous model used in Zhang et al. (2011). The dynamics, especially the basic reproduction number, are more complex.

Finally, we concluded that human rabies in China can be controlled by reducing the birth rate of dogs, increasing the immunization rate of dogs, enhancing the awareness of people about rabies, improving supervision of children and students in the summer, and increasing the medical service and treatment such as PEP after bitten by dogs.",

In future studies, it will be very interesting to obtain regional rabies data (such as provincial data) and more realistic to make inhomogeneous mixing assumption. Reaction\u2013diffusion equation models (Ruan and Wu 2009 and Zhang et al. 2012) or multi-patch models may be more suitable to study the spatial transmission dynamics of rabies in China.
