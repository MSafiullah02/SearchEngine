Some of these reasons are obvious, but some are not so obvious and may even be counterintuitive. One way to understand these complex dynamics of innovation is through empirical studies, and some excellent work in this field does exactly that. The main approach we will take, however, is historical, focusing on genomics and microbiological resources as a field of study, but occasionally straying into related fields of biomedical research (such as bioinformatics or molecular and cellular biology) when they provide better examples to illustrate a point. We will also discuss examples from the broader field of biological resources in general, because of the many analogies between genomics, and studies of life sciences related to microbes and higher life forms. There is some imprecision in the term ''science commons''. The term ''commons'' has been used extensively in legal scholarship to designate goods to which there is open access (Benkler 1998; Lessig 1999 ).

There are many terms marching under the banner of open science or public research. ''Open access'', for example, can mean free access to view information, but not necessarily freedom to use it in all ways without restriction. To some, open science means no one can fence it in. Access to information, say through ''viral'' licensing or copyleft, may be conditional on agreeing not to restrict subsequent users. Information may also simply be put into the public domain, for example by depositing it at a freely available public database, for any and all subsequent uses, both proprietary and open. We focus on this last meaning, with information available to all at low or no cost. Sometimes there are restrictions on its use, but those restrictions must also involve minimal or zero costs.

In particular, the structure of the science commons in genomics and microbiology differs in important respects from the science commons of the ''open source'' communities or the Creative Commons project. That is why it is important to qualify what we mean by open access. Adapting the conventional categories from new institutional economics (see, for example, Schlager and Ostrom 1993) to the life sciences, we can distinguish three important categories of access and use rights. First, access can refer simply to the right to access a resource without being allowed to transform it or do any further research on it. This can be the case when a resource is used for educational purposes for instance. Second, accessing a resource can include the right to transform it and develop new lines of research. Third, in certain cases, permission is given to develop and commercialize follow-on applications. Using these categories, we can distinguish between the following rights that define the components of the science commons in the life sciences: access: the right to access a resource/information; direct use: the right to change a resource/ information; follow-on use: the right to change a resource/ information and obtain ownership of the follow-on applications; management: the right to decide upon the way a resource/information (for instance, a database) is managed; ownership: the right to exclude others from the use of a resource (exclusion right) and to sell the resource and all the related rights (alienation right).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 447, "end": 472, "text": "Schlager and Ostrom 1993)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "From this institutional point of view, it is clear that the structure of the science commons differs widely when discussing cases such as GenBank, 2 MOSAICC 3 and GBIF 4 (see Table 1 ). For instance, as we will discuss below, for GenBank, ''open access'' does not mean that the user of the information automatically has the right to use it for commercial purposes or to develop followon applications. If the sequences published on GenBank are the subject of patents, one has to get a licence to use them in research or product development. 5 For GBIF, the ownership of the resource and all the related rights are in the hands of the local data provider and hence access conditions vary according to the policies of the -mostly public -funding agencies. Access to the international culture collections network MOSAICC is open to all; however, when acquiring a resource, users have to sign a Material Transfer Agreement that should guarantee traceability of the resources and fair benefit-sharing with their providers. These different institutions have found different solutions to what the idea of a science commons means for the provision and use of knowledge. Hence, in evaluating historical examples in their particular context, the institutional structures and the type of collective action has to be specified for each case. What organisations played a major role in the establishment of this science commons? What were the norms of the communities that drove this evolution? And what were the characteristics that enabled collective action in successful cases of the science commons? To deal with these questions, we will first discuss the case of human genetics, because of the historical importance of this case and also because of the key role of genetics in general in the ongoing transformation of research in the life sciences. Next, we will broaden the discussion to other fields of the life sciences, such as plant genetics and general-purpose biotech research tools, to show that in these fields also there is a growing need to systematically address data access and sharing of microbiological information and resources. The data we draw on come mainly from public documents and literature review of case studies in the field. However, informal contacts with officials from umbrella organisations such as the World Federation for Culture Collections (WFCC) and the International Council for Science (ICSU), as well as contacts with genome scientists and bio-informatics researchers in our home universities, also played a key role in the process of sorting out the data.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 175, "end": 182, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Two final conceptual points need to be made before proceeding. First, there is extensive overlap between the different components of the science commons in the life sciences. In particular, research into the properties of whole organisms, ranging from microbes to animals, overlaps with molecular genetics and genomics, proteomics and the development of research tools for screening and genetic engineering. In practice, this has led to hybrid biological research facilities and networks, dedicated to collecting whole organisms but also key parts of organisms such as plasmids (circular DNA, used in biotechnology), cell lines and even entire organisms (in the case of microbes). Prominent examples include the international ex situ seed banks of the 15 Future Harvest Centers, 6 but the same evolution can be observed in the development of biobanks of human tissues (e.g., for cancer research) or vectors used in the highly touted field of genetic therapy. We will move back and forth between these different areas.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Second, there is extensive overlap between academic health research and the science commons in molecular biology. Academic science is important in many fields, not just the life sciences. In all lines of scientific and technical work, universities, not-for-profit research institutions, and government laboratories (referred to collectively here as academic research institutions) play key roles. Many people have been trained in academe, not just the people doing R&D, but also corporate managers and IT professionals, and have thus benefited from the exchange of ideas in academic science. Academe is also one place where the norms of Mertonian science have real traction, where the norms of openness, community, mutual criticism, and fair allocation of credit are supposed to be respected. In some circumstances, however, academic science is done in secret, or results are made available only at great cost or encumbered by restrictions on their use. Such science is not part of a science commons. Great science goes on in industry, including, or even particularly, in the life sciences, but no one expects the norms of openness to prevail in industrial R&D, even if in some circumstances they do. When they do, the results flowing from industrial R&D can become part of the science commons, and there are several instances of this in the case studies to follow. The science commons thus is not the same as academic research. It remains true, nonetheless, that most of the science commons -at least in the life sciences -is based on academic research, and most academic research probably enlarges the science commons (although to our knowledge, no one has really verified this). One reason for interest in academia is that policies put in place over the past three decades have raised concerns about how big the science commons will be, and in particular, whether and to what degree government and not-forprofit funders and academic research institutions will maintain it.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In recent years genomics has been the ground for a vigorous, sometimes even vicious, fight over what should and should not be in the public domain, and under what conditions. Many of the fights have been over preserving the science commons. This has been a matter of explicit policy-making in government, not-for-profit and academic institutions, and private firms since 1992 or 1993, when the commercial promise of genomics became apparent, and private funding for genomics in for-profit companies began to accelerate.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genomics: fights over public and private science in a fishbowl"}, {"text": "The beginning of the Human Genome Project was marked by conflict between scientists who thought it was a poor use of resources and those who thought it a useful and efficient way to spend public research dollars.

As these controversies died down, an even more public conflict over sequencing the entire genome exploded, pitting a private company (Celera) against the public sector genome project. The battleground for both these conflicts was the science commons.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genomics: fights over public and private science in a fishbowl"}, {"text": "The story is often told as a race between J. Craig Venter, who in 1998 announced his intention to sequence the genome at a new start-up company Celera, and the public Human Genome Project whose most conspicuous spokesmen were Francis Collins in the United States and Sir John Sulston in the United Kingdom. Collins was director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at NIH, and Sulston directed the Sanger Centre affiliated with the University of Cambridge and funded mainly by the Wellcome Trust and UK Medical Research Council. A consortium of laboratories funded by government agencies and not-forprofit organisations in North America, Europe and Japan constituted the ''public genome project''. Sulston emerged as the rhetorical champion of that faction, 7 emphasising open science, rapid sharing of data and materials, and a passionate appeal to refrain from patenting bits of the human genome except when they could foreseeably induce investment in the development of end-products such as therapeutic proteins. In 1996, the Wellcome Trust sponsored a Bermuda meeting of the major sequencing centres throughout the world. A set of ''Bermuda Rules'' emerged from the meeting, mandating daily public disclosure of DNA sequence data. The pledge to share data rapidly was linked to a plea not to patent DNA without significantly further characterising gene function and demonstrating utility. Characterising gene function was not the business of the publicly funded DNA sequencing centres, so the Bermuda Rules were in effect a ''no patents'' policy for the sequencing centres.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genomics: fights over public and private science in a fishbowl"}, {"text": "From 1998 until February 2001, when Science and Nature published rival articles with, respectively, the Celera and public genome project results (Lander et al. 2001; Venter et al. 2001) , there were two competing projects focused on sequencing the entire human genome. In addition, several other ''genome projects'' were running in parallel, in both the public and the private sectors. For five years before the extremely visible race between Celera and the ''public genome programme'' got underway for a complete reference sequence, two companies -Human Genome Sciences, Inc., and Incyte Genomics -were busily sequencing human genes. Many other companies were mapping and sequencing parts of the human genome, and thousands of laboratories were contributing sequencing and mapping information to databases and to scientific publications. By the time the initial genomic sequence publications came out, the ratio of private to public funding appeared to be roughly 2 private dollars for every 1 government or not-for-profit dollar (see Fig. 1 ). 8 In 2001, the financial genome bubble burst. At the end of 2000, 74 publicly traded genomic firms were valued at $94 billion, of which the largest 15 accounted for approximately $50 billion. By the end of 2002, those 15 firms' market value had dropped to $10 billion, although their reported R&D expenditures climbed from $1 billion to $1.7 billion during the same 2-year period (Kaufman et al. 2004) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 145, "end": 165, "text": "(Lander et al. 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 166, "end": 185, "text": "Venter et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1047, "text": "8", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1426, "end": 1447, "text": "(Kaufman et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1036, "end": 1042, "text": "Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Genomics: fights over public and private science in a fishbowl"}, {"text": "All these numbers bear mention not to drone on about data, but to make three simple points. First, the private sector invested heavily in genomics, but these investments were made in expectation of financial returns. That was quite different from the public and not-for-profit funding of genomics which was mainly intended to produce public goods -knowledge and materials made widely available to advance knowledge and combat disease. Second, private R&D investment was a powerful adjunct to the public and not-for-profit funding. It followed public R&D in time, and it drew on the science commons without necessarily contributing to it. Its social benefit derived from developing goods and services that would otherwise not be produced. But third, and most to the point for policy purposes, it would be foolhardy to generalize from those happy circumstances where private R&D expands the science commons -to expect private R&D always to contribute to the science commons except in unusual circumstances, usually related to particular features of competition among firms in a particular industrial sector.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genomics: fights over public and private science in a fishbowl"}, {"text": "To see why having a healthy science commons matters, we will first move away from genomics to make a general point about health research. Murphy and Topel (1999) estimated that the economic gains from increased life expectancy attributable to medical research were staggering -in the range of $2.8 trillion per year from 1970 to 1990 ($1.5 trillion of this from cardiovascular disease reduction). Many of the health benefits of discovering new information about health and disease come not from drugs, vaccines, or medical services, but from individuals acting on information. Cutler and Kadiyala (2001) attributed two-thirds of the health gains in cardiovascular disease reduction to the effects of ''public information'', such as stopping or reducing tobacco use, changing diet, getting more exercise, and monitoring blood pressure. The second largest determinant was technological change, such as the introduction of new drugs and services, followed by increasing cigarette taxes to reduce tobacco use (Cutler and Kadiyala 2001) . The estimated return on investment in medical treatment was 4 to 1, but on public information it was 30 to 1.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 138, "end": 161, "text": "Murphy and Topel (1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 577, "end": 603, "text": "Cutler and Kadiyala (2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1005, "end": 1031, "text": "(Cutler and Kadiyala 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Applications in public health: when markets fail"}, {"text": "Cutler and Kadiyala's result cannot be generalised, because smoking is a very large risk factor that is sui generis, and cardiovascular disease has proven far more amenable to many kinds of intervention than cancer and other chronic diseases. Cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and Alzheimer's disease, among others, appear far less tractable. Few if any risk factors will ever be found to rival tobacco use as predictors of poor health. But the finding that information can have an economic value irrespective of being translated into products and services in a paying market is nonetheless important. Even if public information will not be quite as powerful in reducing other chronic diseases as it has been for cardiovascular disease, the vector is likely to point in the same direction. We cannot say that public information will always prove more powerful than information channelled into new drugs, vaccines, biologics, devices, and medical services in the health care system. But if there are any more such instances -and the probability that there will be none seems vanishingly smallthen the health science commons is essential, because it alone can supply the public information benefits. Proprietary science cannot produce public goods, both by definition and for instrumental reasons -to produce such benefits it would have to be shared at no cost. Both words in ''public information'' do a lot of work. We need new information that arises from science, but to capture many social benefits based on that knowledge, we also need it to be public.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Applications in public health: when markets fail"}, {"text": "Genomics provides several other examples of the value of public information. The 2002 report from the World Health organisation, Genomics and World Health gave the example of fosmidomycin (WHO 2002, p. 49 ). This drug is currently being tested in the treatment of malaria in Africa (Missinou et al. 2002) . That use came to light as a consequence of sequencing the genome of the malaria parasite, and noticing a metabolic pathway not previously known to exist. The compound fosmidomycin was known to inhibit the pathway, and had been developed as a treatment for urinary tract infections. When the possibility of using the drug to treat malaria was revealed, it was pulled off the shelf and moved into clinical trials. This is a treatment that may never produce a profit for any company, but the social returns could be enormous if the drug works, because so many millions of people are infected with malaria. If not fosmidomycin, then perhaps other findings will lead to the prevention or treatment of malaria, enabled by the existence of the full genomic sequences for host, pathogen, and mosquito vector. 9 Making the information about these organisms available worldwide is essential to accruing the benefits of research. There is only a weak world market in drugs to treat malaria because it is largely an affliction in resource-poor populations. The usual profit motives of the intellectual property system cannot create incentives where there is no prospect of profit to drive products through an expensive discovery and testing process. But networks of not-for-profit organisations, such as the Malaria Vaccine Initiative, the Global Fund, the WHO essential medicines programme, and other sources of ''public'' capital might be capable of discovering and developing new treatments despite the absence of commercial profit.

Several lines of research corroborate the intuition that a pool of public information and materials must surely ''raise all ships'' to the benefit of each of them.

Finally, we find that large firms are more likely to use public research than small firms, with the exception that start-up firms also make particular use of public research, especially in pharmaceuticals.

But at that time they did not know that it would have far more important implications. The strain that was isolated from this discovery was deposited at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) in Washington DC, the largest culture collection in the world, holding over 70,000 strains from microbiological material from all over the world.

Having a sequence published on GenBank (or any alternative recognised international erepository) is a requirement for publishing scientific research on a new gene sequence in most journals.

Further refinements are possible for related databases, such as Gene and RefSeq, which contain more fully characterised gene sequences. But detailed annotation and reliability of data vary among GenBank sequences.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "19. This decentralised management of culture collections has also led to important cooperation problems in the collection of strains. Indeed collection is a collaborative effort with the biodiversity rich countries that depends on clear agreements on benefit sharing and technology transfer. However, the competition between the culture collections has led to a ''race to the bottom'', where collectors try to obtain the most strains with the fewest constraints. 21. For instance the UK based CABI culture collection consortium developed a biological control agent from a fungi that can be used for killing insects on crops. After developing a spray based on this fungus, CABI was granted the exclusive property rights. CABI granted a licence to a corporate partner in South Africa to market one variety under the name ''Green Muscle''.

Elliston, Associate Director, Bioinformatics, of the Merck Research Laboratories. Dr. Greg Lennon's laboratory at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Livermore, California) has been supplying arrayed cDNA clones to Dr. Robert Waterston's laboratory (the Genome Sequencing Centre) at the Washington University School of Medicine (St. Louis, Missouri) for sequencing. The sequence data are being submitted to the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) division of GenBank on a regular basis for immediate distribution.

Sulston's model for the human genome project was the biology of the worm -a close-knit community of scientists who studied nematodes, and had made immense scientific progress in a hub-and-spoke model of biology. Two central laboratories -one at the University of Cambridge and another at Washington University in Saint Louis -created large data sets centrally at large computing and instrumentation facilities dedicated to expensive genomewide mapping and sequencing projects on the worm genome. Those hubs shared data quickly and widely with the spokes -a network of smaller laboratories throughout the world. Sulston wrote The Common Thread with Georgina Ferry to tell the genome story from his point of view. His model was a public works project in genomics, with public funding producing a valuable scientific resource (Sulston and Ferry 2002) .8. In a snapshot taken of year 2000 genomics research funding, approximately 70 non-profit and government funders provided an estimated $1.6-1.7 billion; 74 publicly traded firms dedicated wholly to or including genomics research as a major function reported over $2 billion in R&D expenditures; and assuming the reported 3-5 per cent of R&D in major pharmaceutical firms was for genomics (based on survey responses and rough informal estimates of pharma R&D managers), established firms were spending $800 million to $1 billion in genomics research (World Survey of Funding for Genomics Research, Stanford-in-Washington programme http:// www.stanford.edu/class/siw198q/ websites/genomics/entry.htm (accessed 2 April 2005)). 9. Sequences for both the most virulent pathogen, Plasmodium falciparum, and the most common vector, Anopheles gambiae, were published in 2002: Gardner, et al. (2002) and Holt et al. (2002) .10. This story of sharing sequence information is linked to a potential intellectual property story that could be complicated. At least three of the institutions that did the sequencing have applied for patents, and interference proceedings could be complex, as they are in different countries and on different strains that might need to be cross-Licenced for many practical applications. A patent pool could emerge, or a monster interference proceeding to sort out the questions of inventorship. The legal costs could exceed the costs of deriving the sequence itself.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 62, "end": 64, "text": "RC", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 891, "end": 915, "text": "(Sulston and Ferry 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1786, "end": 1808, "text": "Gardner, et al.
