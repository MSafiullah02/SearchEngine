When the lungs are heavily involved, as seen in COVID-19 patients, this may have a major impact on cardiac function, particularly that of the right ventricle. Finally, COVID-19 may have direct effects on the heart, as may some drugs being used in its treatment.",

However, given its wide availability and key role as a bedside test, echocardiography is the most affected cardiac imaging modality. Common challenges faced by all cardiac imaging modalities during the pandemic include limited expert staff availability [sickness or redeployment in prioritized areas, such as intensive care units (ICUs)] and the risk of peri-procedural transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between patients and staff. The scope of these EACVI recommendations is to summarize how these challenges may be addressed during the pandemic. In particular, we focus upon bold prioritization and provide specific indications and recommendations on how to perform an echocardiogram during the pandemic whilst safeguarding both patient and staff.",

In parallel with echocardiography and other imaging modalities, CMR and CT should only be performed if the expected information is critical for clinical management and can be justified in the face of the following considerations: (i) risk of transportation of critically ill or high-risk patients; (ii) time duration of CMR; (iii) possible/significant risk of infection for professionals (technicians, physicians, nurses, and other personnel); (iv) possible/significant risk of contamination of equipment and facilities, leading to the need for full disinfection; and (v) whether the test is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, or whether this can be achieved based simply upon the clinical probability.

Similar and additional effects can be caused by reduced oxygenation of the blood due to respiratory failure. This may help explain why co-existing cardiovascular disease is a negative predictor in COVID-19 patients.1 Clinical decision-making may be complicated in these critically ill patients, and cardiac imaging may be decisive. However, unnecessary examinations should be avoided to reduce risk of contamination of personnel and misuse of resources. Indeed, careful consideration should be given to whether echocardiography and cardiac imaging will change management, including whether patients would be candidates for more advanced treatment strategies on the basis of the results of an echocardiogram. If not, the scan may be futile.",
