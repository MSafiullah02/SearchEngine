Since the first report of pneumonia caused by the H1N1 virus in Mexico, several severe cases have been found throughout the world.[12] The histopathologic changes observed in this type of pneumonia were consolidation, focal squamous metaplasia, diffuse alveolar damage, pulmonary edema, and acute pulmonary hemorrhage.[3] Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in high-resolution CT scan (HRCT) imaging and reduced diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) have also been reported at 3 months in a short-term follow-up study.[4] Long-term follow-up studies on radiologic-pathologic correlation of fibrosis in swine flu cases are not available, especially the data from our country. We are reporting a case of swine flu pneumonia who developed interstitial lung disease (ILD) during recovery.",

On examination of the chest, basal crepitations were present on both sides. The chest skiagram showed bilateral consolidation predominantly involving lower zones. Investigations revealed hemoglobin 10.9 g/ dl, total leucocyte count (TLC) 4300/\u03bcl, and differential leucocyte count \u2013 neutrophil 80.7%, lymphocyte 17.5%, and platelet count 1.6 \u00d7105/\u03bcl. The biochemical profile showed blood sugar 90 mg/dl, blood urea 35 mg/dl, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, total protein 6.9 g/dl, bilirubin 0.6 mg/ dl, and SGOT/SGPT 384 and 186 U/l, respectively. The throat swab sample for the H1N1 PCR test was positive. In PCR testing, the sample was processed and RNA extraction was done with a kit (Qiagen kit, Hildane, Germany). Then RT-PCR was done with a real-time amplification machine under thermocycling conditions with reverse transcription at 50\u00b0C for 30 min. Activation took place at 95\u00b0C for 10 min and then PCR amplification was carried out at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and at 55\u00b0C for 30 s (45 cycles). She was diagnosed as a case of H1N1 community acquired pneumonia. The patient was put on empirical antibiotics, oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily for 15 days) and oxygen supplementation.",

She was intubated and put on mechanical ventilatory support. Initially, the patient was put on a pressure control mode with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 6 cm of H2O. After few days of ventilatory support, she developed pneumothorax on the right side of the chest which was involving almost 40 % of hemithorax along with surgical emphysema on the same side for which an intercostal drain tube (ICD) was placed. After development of pneumothorax, the PEEP was reduced to 5 cm of H2O. Tracheal culture was sterile on the 12th day. Afterward, it became positive for Enterobacter cloacae on the 26th day and Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the 42nd day. TLC also showed an increasing trend and was 19,500/\u03bcl on the 18th day after admission. Tracheostomy was done on the 20th day of admission.",

On examination of the chest, bilateral late inspiratory crepitations were present. During a 6-min walk test (6MWT), she was able to walk a distance of 342 m, and pulse oximetry showed a fall in arterial oxygen saturation from 97% to 78%. A restrictive pattern was found on lung function tests (FEV1= 0.84 l, 27.1% of predicted; FVC = 1.01 l, 28% of predicted, with the FEV1/FVC ratio being 83.2%). The patient was unable to perform the diffusion test because of a low vital capacity (1.01 l). A chest X-ray showed bilateral lower zone reticulonodular shadows [Figure 2a]. The HRCT scan showed reticulonodular shadows and ground-glass haziness. The dominant picture was reticulonodular shadowing. There were areas of honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis. Findings remained unchanged even in a prone position [Figures 2b, 3a and b]. Her bronchoscopy was done which showed a normal tracheobronchial tree. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) were done. The microscopic examination of BAL showed total cells to be 400/\u03bcl and the differential count was 60% lymphocytes and 40% neutrophils. BAL was negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). The histopathologic examination of the TBLB sample with the hematoxylin and eosin stain showed chronic nonspecific inflammatory cells and fibroblasts [Figure 4a]. TBLB was negative for malignancy and tuberculosis. When special Van Gieson's stain was used, the pathological examination revealed multiple areas of fibrocollagenous foci suggestive of interstitial fibrosis [Figure 4b].",

In our patient, the HRCT findings of fibrosis were also substantiated by the histopathology of bronchial biopsy samples. Similar to the findings of Mineo et al., the pattern of the distribution of fibrosis in our patient was peripheral.[8] Pulmonary fibrosis has also been reported in patients with diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
