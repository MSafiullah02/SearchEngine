Indian government announced a 21 days nationwide lockdown, starting 25thMarch, 2020.5 Consequences of this lockdown for patients of diabetes could be; absent or less exercise, changes in diet (e.g. e.g. increased snacking, consumption of \u2018comfort\u2019 dense calorie foods), and decreased availability of anti-hyperglycemic agents and/or insulin. Importantly, such lockdown poses restrictions in routine visits to the physician. Overall, all these factors may lead to uncontrolled glycaemia or worsening status of comorbid diseases (e.g. hypertension). During this unprecedented situation, telemedicine may prove useful for the management of patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes.",

This study showed a reduction in HbA1c by -0.37% (p <0.001) in telemedicine group when compared to controls.11 In a Cochrane review done by Flodgren and colleagues12, 21 RCTs of patient with diabetes (n,2768) were analyzed. These patients had interactive telemedicine (remote monitoring or real time video) delivered in addition to, or as an alternative to, or partly substituted for standard care vs. standard care alone. This study showed that there was a reduction of HbA1c by -0.31% (p <0.001) in patients on telemedicine when compared with controls. In a recently published review of 46 studies, which included patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, n, 24000) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM n, 2052), different modes of telemedicine were studied.
