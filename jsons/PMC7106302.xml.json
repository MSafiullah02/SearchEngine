In humans, AIH is characterized by the presence of interface hepatitis and portal plasma cell infiltration, hypergammaglobulinemia, increased serum transaminases and autoantibodies (autoAb) to liver antigens (Ag). Like most other autoimmune diseases, this disorder results from a complex interaction between triggering factors, such as viral infections, genetic predisposition, and immunoregulatory networks [1], [2], [3], [4].",

We have reported the presence of autoantibodies (autoAb) to fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) in sera from various mouse strains after MHV infection [12]. The autoAb recognized conformational as well as linear antigenic determinants in the enzyme, and the autoimmune response was partly related to molecular mimicry [13], [14], [15]. Furthermore, we have shown that the induction of the anti-FAH autoAb was associated with the MHV-induced release of some danger signals [16], also called DAMPs (damage-associated molecular patterns) or alarmins [17].",

In those models, liver damage was observed, and in some conditions elevated transaminases. However, no Ab to liver proteins other than those directed to the immunogen, neither high Ig plasmatic levels were reported. In addition, most models were described as transient, since the mechanisms critical for perpetuation of liver damage are still unknown [for a review see Refs. [3], [5], [6]]. Besides, we have recently found that a simple and common phenomenon, i.e., a viral infection inducing autoAb to an autologous protein followed by a toxic liver injury, could induce some signs of AIH [18]. It was proposed that the release of a greater amount of alarmins [22] could induce the expansion of the autoimmune response and establish a pathology that resembles AIH [18].",

            "text": "Uric acid, one of the most studied alarmins [23], increased in serum from \u201cPADRE\u201d animals at all times tested, whereas its level in \u201cMHV\u201d augmented after 30 and 45 days of treatment. Furthermore, uric acid concentration was higher than controls only after 45 days of viral infection in \u201cMHV + PADRE\u201d mice. One could speculate that plasmatic uric acid in \u201cMHV + PADRE\u201d mice after 30 days of treatment was similar to controls, and lower than values found in \u201cMHV\u201d animals, due to urate crystals retention within the hepatocytes. In fact, once the uric acid concentration was tested in whole liver tissue 30 days after treatment, results showed identical values in \u201cMHV\u201d and \u201cMHV + PADRE\u201d animals. On the other hand, serum HGMB1 concentration significantly augmented with time in the three animal groups, even in \u201cPADRE\u201d mice.",

Consequently, the effects of PADRE on the release of both alarmins are unexpectedly and intriguing. As it was found that the uric acid levels present in plasma from \u201dPADRE\u201d animals were elevated, but not in the hepatocyte extracts, the origins of both alarmins are probably not the hepatocytes, but perhaps the stimulated lymphocytes or other non antigen-specific leucocytes. One can also speculate that PADRE is recognized by some PRRs (pattern-recognizing receptors such as the Toll-like receptors and NOD-like receptors), a fact that has, to our knowledge, not been reported so far.",

In addition, regulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells (Tregs) were found numerically and functionally defective in human AIH [30]. However, this control could be inhibited by non-specific activation of innate immunity through Toll-like receptor 3 [31]. Moreover, it has been reported that uric acid could amplify humoral immune responses [22] and that various Toll-like receptors associated with the inhibition of Tregs may bind alarmins such as heat shock proteins, HMGB1 and chromatin [32], [33]. Thus, it is possible that alarmins released under the effects of MHV and PADRE could bind to some Toll-like receptors and indirectly inhibit Tregs, so inducing some of the AIH signs.",

Therefore, the first part of the objective was reached, since our present results demonstrate that infection of susceptible individuals with a hepatotropic virus triggers some AIH signs. Moreover, since the administration of PADRE adjuvant seemed to expand some MHV effects, one can speculate that a simple vaccination of an infected genetically vulnerable person may eventually initiate the illness. Nevertheless, the chronic phase of the disease, as well as the fibrosis normally found in liver of AIH patients is still lacking in our model. Although more efforts are needed to achieve that goal, the findings indicate that a simple infection with a virus, instead of complex and not natural protocols of immunization, may simulate the onset of the illness and contribute to the study of its pathophysiology.",
