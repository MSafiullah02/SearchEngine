            "text": "Glycyrrhizic acid (18\u03b2-GL or GL) is one of the bioactive compounds of licorice roots (Glycyrrhiza radix) and is composed of one molecule of glycyrrhetinic acid (18\u03b2-GA or GA), which has a steroid-like structure, and two molecules of glucuronic acid. After oral administration or intravenous injection, GL is hydrolyzed by glucuronidase in intestinal bacteria to its active principle aglycone, 18\u03b2-GA, which is then absorbed into the blood (Takeda et al., 1996). GL and GA have been shown to possess several beneficial pharmacological activities (Dirnagl et al., 1999, Shibata, 2000, Abe et al., 2003, Armanini et al., 2002, Cherng et al., 2006, Cinatl et al., 2005, Fiore et al., 2004), which include an anti-ulcerative effect, anti-inflammatory activity (Fujisawa et al., 2000), interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 induction, anti-hepatotoxic effect (Chan et al., 2003, Gumpricht et al., 2005, Zheng and Lou, 2003), anti-tumor activity (Hibasami et al., 2006), and it is active against a range of viruses (Lin, 2003, Cinatl et al., 2003, Crance et al., 2003, Briolant et al., 2004, Cherng et al., 2004, Hoever et al., 2005). Clinically, GL has been used to treat patients with chronic active hepatitis (van Rossum et al., 1999, Bean, 2002, Coon and Ernst, 2004).",

            "text": "In previous years, we have shown that many nucleoside analogs selectively inhibit replication of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in vitro (Lin et al., 1983, Lin et al., 1984, Lin et al., 1985, Lin et al., 1986, Lin et al., 1987, Lin et al., 1991, Lin et al., 1992, Lin and Machida, 1988, Mar et al., 1995; for a review see Gershburg and Pagano, 2005, Lin, 2006). The molecular target of all nucleoside analogs is the virus-encoded DNA polymerase. Recently, we have reported that GL is active in a dose-dependent fashion against EBV replication in superinfected Raji cells (Lin, 2003). Our results also indicated that GL interferes with an early step of the EBV replication cycle (possibly adsorption and/or penetration) (Lin, 2003). Thus, GL represents a new class of anti-EBV compounds with a mode of action different from that of the nucleoside analogs that inhibit the viral DNA polymerase. In the present studies we extend our previous findings after a search for more potent compounds against EBV. We tested the antiviral activity of 15 GL derivatives synthesized in the laboratory. Here we report the identification of seven active compounds against EBV infection in vitro and elucidate their structure\u2013activity relationships.",

Without drug treatment, approximately 95% of infected cells became positive for viral antigens (Fig. 1, panel A). In the presence of drugs, a dose-dependent inhibition of the expression of viral antigens was observed (Fig. 1, panels B, C, D, and E). The concentration of drug required to inhibit EBV antigen expression by 50% (EC50) was determined from the plot of drug concentrations against % of viral antigen-positive cells, assuming no-drug control as 100. Fig. 2A shows graphical quantitation for compound (XV). The EC50 determined from the graph was approximately 42 \u03bcM. As shown in Table 1\n, seven GL derivatives were active against EBV infection with EC50 ranging from 42 to 175 \u03bcM. All these active compounds exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition manner. The parental compound GL was used as a positive drug control. In addition, GA, the metabolite of GL was also tested in parallel with the derivatives. It is interesting to note that GA was the most effective compound to block EBV infection with an EC50 of 5 \u03bcM, which was 7.6-fold lower than for GL (38 \u03bcM). However, GA was approximately 60-fold more toxic (CC50\n = 75 \u03bcM) than GL (CC50\n = 4500 \u03bcM).",

Superinfection of Raji cells with P3HR-1 virus results in shut-down of host cell DNA synthesis and stimulation of viral DNA replication and lytic antigen synthesis and production of virus. We have previously shown that the percentage of EA- and VCA-positive cells is directly proportional to the amount of EBV DNA in the cells (Lin, 2003). Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that GL blocks EBV replication at an early step of the viral replication cycle. However, GL has no effects on EBV DNA in the spontaneously virus-producing cell line P3HR-1 and the latently infected nonvirus-producing Raji cells (Lin, 2003). The lack of effect of GL in P3HR-1 and Raji cells, which are already infected, is consistent with our proposed mechanism of GL action, i.e., inhibition of virus attachment/penetration. Thus, superinfection of Raji cells represents a useful system for evaluation of compounds that block early steps in the EBV replication cycle.",

Interestingly, other substitutions at the R\u2032 position of GA, such as Lys(z)-OH in compound (V) and l-Glu(OMe)-OMe in compound (XIV), did not confer any antiviral activity. Thus, it appears that the modification of the carbohydrate moiety of GL rather than the R\u2032 position of aglycon may affect the antiviral activity. These findings may provide a lead for further development of more active antiviral compounds.",

Unexpectedly, GA, the metabolic product of GL, was 7.5-fold more active (EC50\n = 4 \u03bcM) against EBV than its parental compound (EC50\n = 30 \u03bcM), but was 60-fold more toxic (CC50\n = 75 \u03bcM) than GL (CC50\n = 4500 \u03bcM), resulting in a therapeutic index of 19 and 150, respectively. Introduction of potassium [compound (VI)] or ammonium salt [compound (VII)] to GL reduced the antiviral activity with a significant effect on cytotoxicity. The \u03b1-isomer [18\u03b1-GL, compound (VIII)] derived from 18\u03b2-GL was as potent as the \u03b2-form, with EC50 of 30 and CC50 of 4800, resulting in a therapeutic index of 160. In contrast, the sodium salt of \u03b1-isomer of 18\u03b2-GL [compound (XI)] lost antiviral activity as compared to its \u03b2-form [compound (X)]. Previous study indicated that the sugar moiety of GL is essential for anti-SARS-CoV activity (Hoever et al., 2005). The present study clearly demonstrated that compounds (VI), (VII), (VIII), (X), (XII), (XIII), and (XV) are active inhibitors of EBV infection and all contain a sugar moiety. In summary, among the newly identified analogs four showed better or equal activity than the parent GL.",

However, other possible mechanism of GL may also involve inhibition of EBV replication. Both GL and GA have been shown to elicit a dose-dependent increase in NO production and the level of iNOS mRNA in macrophages (Jeong and Kim, 2002). As a host defense molecule, NO has an antimicrobial activity against a variety of pathogens including viruses. Previous studies indicated that NO is involved in maintaining EBV latency through inhibition of EBV reactivation (Mannick et al., 1994, Gao et al., 1999).",

            "text": "The molecular mechanism underlying the GL inhibition of viral attachment is not well understood. A complement protein called C3d is a breakdown product of complement C3. Receptors for C3d, called type 2 complement receptors (CR2 or CD21), are expressed on mature B lymphocytes. When B lymphocytes recognize an antigen by their antigen receptors and simultaneously recognize C3d bound to the antigen by the complement receptor, the B cells are activated. The major EBV outer envelope glycoprotein gp350/220 is the CD21 ligand (Nemerow et al., 1987, Tanner et al., 1987). CD21 is the only B-lymphocyte surface protein that binds to gp350/220 (Nemerow et al., 1989), which mediates virus attachment to the EBV/C3dg receptor (CR2) of human B lymphocytes. A recent study indicated that complement C3 is a GL-binding protein (Kawakami et al., 2003). Synthetic peptides corresponding to two regions in gp350/220, which have a similar amino acid sequence with the complement C3dg protein, were used to identify a receptor binding epitope. A peptide corresponding to the N terminus of gp350/220, EDPGFFNVEI, bound to purified CR2 and to CR2 positive but not CR2 negative B and T lymphoblastoid cell lines (Nemerow et al., 1989). This peptide sequence EDPGFFNVEI is similar to the peptide sequence EDPGKQLYNVEA, through which the C3d component of complement binds to CD21 (Nemerow et al., 1989). Synthetic peptides containing the LYNVEA C3d sequence block C3d binding to CD21 (Lambris et al., 1985), whereas peptides containing the EDPGFFNVEA sequence block EBV infection (Nemerow et al., 1989, Nemerow et al., 1990). Taken together these studies open the possibility that the inhibitory effect of GL could be in part due to the blockade of EBV receptor. The anti-EBV activity of glycopeptides (XII), (XIII), and (XV) could be attributed to the similarity of their amino acid residues with the peptide sequence EDPGKQLYNVA of C3d component of complement that binds to CD21. Ascertaining this possibility would require further study and is currently under investigation.",
