One is lateral flow, a one-step technique where the sample is placed on a test device and the results are read in 5\u201330 min. Lateral flow devices can test for a single analyte or multiple analytes. The second is a flow-through system, which requires a number of steps \u2013 placing the sample on the device, a washing step, and then adding an analyte\u2013colloidal gold conjugate that makes the test result visible to the eye. The results can then be read after a few minutes, but the whole process can take as long as 20 min. One sample is tested per cassette. This format is less popular than lateral flow because of the necessity for multiple assay steps and the greater skill that is required for operating these devices.",

In hospitals, clinics, physician offices, and clinical laboratories, LF-based tests are used for the qualitative and quantitative detection of a wide variety of antigens and antibodies. More recently, they are being developed to measure the products of gene amplification. They can be used to test just about any biological sample, including urine, tears, sweat, saliva, serum, plasma, whole blood, and biopsied tissue and fluids. LF-based tests are also used in veterinary medicine, for quality control, to assure product safety in food production, environmental testing, water safety, and pharmaceutical and biologics manufacturing. In these circumstances, rapid tests are used to screen for pathogens and toxins in raw materials, the manufacturing environment, and the finished product. Water utilities test drinking water for chemical toxins, metals, and pathogens. Rapid test systems are also used to assess progress in environmental remediation of soil and ground water pollutants. Veterinarians use rapid tests to screen commercial livestock and household pets for a number of medical conditions.",

            "text": "Growth in LF testing is derived mainly from the clinical and veterinary sectors where more of the current test menu will be used in more places outside a central laboratory in response to increased interest in public health issues and the prevalence of chronic diseases. Since the early 1990s, clinical LF tests have grown in popularity. Predictions are that patient self-testing will skyrocket because of rising consumer expectations, technological innovations, and the surge of consumer activism in healthcare. Furthermore, pharmacies, retail outlets, and physician offices are establishing their position for patient wellness screening. The expectation is that, under these conditions, point-of-care (POC) testing \u2013 self-tests and professional \u2013 will grow at 20\u201325% per year instead of the 10% predicted here. However, this may be more a case of wishful thinking than reality. This is because current tests and technologies cannot accommodate the needs of the consumer and professional markets. For consumer self-testing, many of the tests are blood-based, which is not a user-friendly sampling type. Thus, manufacturers have begun the search for alternate samples such as urine and saliva. In the professional setting, most POC tests do not meet the quality standards offered by laboratory-based tests. Further, the thought is that new tests and technologies are just too expensive. Faster, more sensitive, more user-friendly, and less expensive tests may produce better market penetration.",

It allows for the production of a one-step device incorporating saliva sampling and testing.Talecris Biotherapeutics and BBI Holdings PLC are developing a physician office test device as a screening tool for detecting patients\u2019 levels of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT), the naturally occurring protein that is present at low levels in individuals suffering from Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency.The UK\u2019s Institute of Biomedical Science is promoting the development of particle-based immunoassays incorporating lateral flow membrane technology for a rapid allergy assay using a 20-\u00b5l sample of whole blood.WaveSense LLC introduced the UltraPlatform, a proprietary magnetic bead\u2013based lateral flow separations system, which is designed to capture and sort live cells, proteins, and or genes for testing.\n",
