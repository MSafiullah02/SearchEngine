This new pulmonary infection first developed in China at the end of 2019, specifically in Wuhan [1\u20133]. Currently, a COVID-19 outbreak is also occurring in Europe, with a cluster in Northern Italy. On March 22, 2020, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Italy was 59138 with a mortality rate of 9.3%. Given the mortality rate of this disease [4, 5], physicians should be aware of the potential risk factors associated with a fatal outcome [6\u20139]. To improve the risk stratification and aid clinicians in defining a \u201ctailored\u201d level of care for high-risk patients, an experimental chest X-ray (CXR) scoring system for quantifying the severity and progression of lung abnormalities in COVID-19 pneumonia was introduced in our Diagnostic Imaging Department [10]. This CXR scoring system (named Brixia score), designed exclusively for semi-quantitative assessment of lung disease in COVID-19, ranking the pulmonary involvement on an 18-point severity scale according to extent and characteristics of lung abnormalities (for more details, see Reference 10).",
