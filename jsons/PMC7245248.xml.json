It has recently attracted considerable attention as a renewable, biodegradable and environment-friendly energy source [[1], [2], [3]]. Compared with the conventional alkali catalysis, biocatalysis by lipases aroused extensive research due to the more gentle reaction conditions, better adaptation to feedstock including waste and inedible oils containing high percentage of free fatty acids or water, less downstream processing and pollutions [[4], [5], [6]].",

A lot of efforts have been made to reduce the cost of this procedure. Some researches focused on the low cost lipases with good transesterification performance though modification or immobilization lipases to improve the reusability and stability in biodiesel process. Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (TLL), in modified and immobilized forms, has been more and more widely concerned [[7], [8], [9]] due to its relatively low cost and highly adaptable feedback (e.g. waste oil with high water concentration). Other researches concentrated on the optimized conditions to improve the transesterification efficiency [[10], [11], [12]]. Main factors affecting biodiesel process (reaction time, reaction temperature, methanol/oil molar ratio, type and concentration of biocatalyst as well as water content) were observed and optimized by analyzing their interactions. The current studies usually emphasized on either the low-cost lipase preparation or the biodiesel process optimization and few studies involve both of them. However, both sides are equally crucial to accelerate biodiesel industrial by biocatalysts.",

Compared with the regular assemblage shape of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and native TLL particles, the MRL demonstrated different surface appearance in Fig. 2 C. The root mean square roughness value of the MRL was estimated to be 8.29 nm, which is between the value of native TLL particles (1.06 nm) and Fe3O4 nanoparticles (16.2 nm).

In a certain extent, the higher methanol/oil molar ratio could be more helpful in promoting the yield of FAMEs while the methanol could also result in loss or inactivation of the enzyme activity [33,34]. For the multiple roles and strong influence of water in the reaction system, the activation of enzyme mainly embodied the conformational changes of the lipase molecules due to the exposing and restructuring of the catalytic active sites, which required the presence of oil-water interface [35,36]. So the existence and a considerable concentration of water were in favor of the enzyme structural stabilization to enhance the transesterification efficiency but could accelerate the hydrolysis reaction and decrease the yield of FAMEs [37,38].",

To test the operation stability and reusability of the MRL in biodiesel process, batch transesterification of soybean oil was conducted by the addition of MRL. The reaction conditions were the optimal conditions mentioned in Table 5. The MRL recovered with magnetic separation, washed sufficiently with phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.5) and dried as described in 2.2, then applied in the next batch with fresh substrates. As expected, the MRL embodied fine transesterification activity retention in repeated use in Fig. 5\n. Under the optimal conditions, the yield of FAMEs was still up to 73.18 % and dropped only by 10.97 % after 10 cycles. The decrease of activity was probably caused by the loss of MRL during the magnetic recovery process (see the inset of Fig. 5). However, the protein content of the MRL declined by only 17.91 %, for the reason that the occurrence of Fe3O4\u2212COOH nanoparticles anchored on the MRL and the mild separation method by a magnet, might help to enhance the tolerance to the organic solvent environment and relieve the loss of enzyme dosage.",
