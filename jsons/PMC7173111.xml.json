            "text": "Cellular APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 1-like) is a family of cellular cytidine deaminase-editing enzymes, including APOBEC1, APOBEC2, seven APOBEC3 variants and activation-induced deaminase (Aguiar and Peterlin, 2008, Jarmuz et al., 2002, Wedekind et al., 2003). APOBEC3G (A3G) belongs to this family and has potent antiretroviral activity (Mangeat et al., 2003, Turelli et al., 2004, Wang and Wang, 2009). A3G contains a duplication of the conserved HXEX23\u201328-CPX2\u20134C motif, wherein the N-terminal domain probably has an ability to bind to RNA, while the C-terminal domain possesses cytidine deamination activity (Chiu and Greene, 2008). Previous studies have suggested that the deamination of cytidine to uridine in nascent minus-strand transcripts during reverse transcription is the most important reason for A3G's antiviral effects (Harris et al., 2003, Mangeat et al., 2003). However, recent data have shown that A3G can inhibit HBV replication in a deaminase-independent way (Nguyen et al., 2007, Turelli et al., 2004). In the absence of viral infectivity factor (Vif), A3G is specifically incorporated into the assembling HIV-1 virions, reducing the infectivity of the newly produced virus (Alce and Popik, 2004). It is also incorporated into murine leukemia viruses and coronaviruses (Wang and Wang, 2009, Zhang et al., 2008). The mechanism of A3G incorporating into HIV-1 virons may be through interaction with HIV-1 Gag (Cen et al., 2004, Douaisi et al., 2004). Recently, some reports pointed out that A3G virion recruitment by Gag/NC is RNA-dependent (Burnett and Spearman, 2007, Wang et al., 2008b), while others believed that it was RNA-independent (Alce and Popik, 2004, Soros et al., 2007). Whether cellular RNA or viral genomic RNA plays a role in the virion packaging of A3G remains to be determined.",

During HBV infection, the relaxed circular (RC)-DNA is converted to covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which acts as the template for transcription of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and antigen-coding mRNAs. pgRNA is the template for reverse transcription and specifies the codes for the HBV core protein (HBc) and the HBV polymerase. HBc is the major component of the nucleocapsid shell packaging the HBV genome. Furthermore, it plays an essential role in the formation of HBV replication complexes (Guarnieri et al., 2006). Baumert et al. (2007) mentioned that A3G did not affect the early steps of the HBV life cycle, but it may interfere with the packaging of HBV. However, the mechanism by which A3G is incorporated into HBV viral particles has not been fully established.",

The three-cube FRET measurement has been described previously (Gao et al., 2007). Images were obtained with an inverted microscope Nikon TE2000 equipped with a mercury lamp light source (100 W), Dual-View (Optical Insights, LLC, Santa Fe, NM) and a SNAP-HQ-cooled CCD camera. Three-cube FRET filter cubes were listed as follows (excitation, dichroic, emission): CFP (S430/25 nm; 455dclp; S470/30 nm), YFP (S500/20 nm, Q515lp, S535/30 nm), and FRET (S430/25 nm, 455dclp, S535/30 nm). We used binning 2 \u00d7 2 modes and 200 ms of exposure time. Average background signal was determined as the mean fluorescence intensity from a blank area and was subtracted from the raw images before carrying out FRET calculations. The following equation was used to calculate the FRET ratio (FR): FR = [FRET \u2212 (b\n \u00d7 CFP)]/(a\n \u00d7 YFP), in which parameters a and b represent the fractions of bleed-through of YFP and CFP fluorescence through the FRET filter channel, respectively (Takanishi et al., 2006). MetaMorph5.0 software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) was used to control the imaging setup and analyze the cell image data.",

Images were obtained with 40\u00d7 NA 1.0 oil immersion objective lens of a confocal microscopy (FV1000, Olympus). CFP and YFP fluorophore were excited by 458- and 514-nm laser lines at 25-mW argon laser. Band pass filters of 462\u2013484 and 580\u2013612 nm were used in collecting emission from CFP and YFP, respectively. For acceptor photobleaching, images were obtained in the CFP and YFP channels; then a region of cell was selected and the intensity of the signal was calculated. YFP was then selectively photobleached in the defined region of the cell. A second set of images was then obtained using the same conditions prior to photobleaching. The increase in CFP fluorescence after YFP photobleaching corresponds to the original amount of energy transferred from CFP to YFP; thus, the difference in CFP fluorescence before and after photobleaching corresponds to the level of FRET. Effective FRET ratio (E\nEFF) between CFP (donor) and YFP (acceptor) was quantified with acceptor photobleaching methods (Karpova et al., 2003) using the following equation: E\nEFF\n = ((A\n1\n \u2212 \nA\n0)/A\n0) \u00d7 100%, in which A\n0 and A\n1 are the intensities of CFP in the photobleached region before and after photobleaching, respectively.",

It is a sensitive and convenient way to report protein-folding mechanisms in living cells. To measure the steady-state of three-cube FRET, CFP or YFP was imaged using an epifluorescence microscopy through CFP, YFP and FRET filter channels. As expected, neither CFP nor YFP can be excited by 500 or 430 nm wavelength lights, but there was some signal in the FRET filter set (due to bleed-through of CFP/YFP). We removed this part of the signal in carrying out FRET calculations. To ensure the reliability of our recording system, we carried out some control experiments. First, cells co-expressing CFP and YFP that served as a negative control, and no FRET signal was observed (FR = 0.97 \u00b1 0.02, n\n = 32). On the other hand, cells expressing the CFP\u2013YFP concatemer, which served as a positive control, showed a significant FRET signal (FR = 5.47 \u00b1 0.05, n\n = 49) (Fig. 2\n). Therefore, these control experiments verified that three-cube FRET provides sensitive and selective detection of FRET. Then we tested the interaction between A3G and HBc using the same system described above. We found that the FRET signal was produced from co-expression of A3G-CFP and HBc-YFP (FR = 1.68 \u00b1 0.04, n\n = 52). We also co-transfected pA3G-CFP with pEYFP-N1 in HepG2 cells as a negative control. The FR value was 0.99 \u00b1 0.01 (n\n = 61), similar to the result from the negative control. These results suggested that there was an interaction between A3G and HBc in living cells.",

Usually, HBc assembles into small and large icosahedral particles, so here we constructed an assembly defective mutant (pHBc-Y132A-HA) (Bourne et al., 2009). Proteins A3G-HA and HBc-Y132A-HA were purified by anti-HA antibody-conjugated agarose beads.

In order to examine the role of RNA in the interaction between them, we added the total RNA of HepG2 cells or HepG2.2.15 cells to the A3G protein solution before SPR analysis. As shown in Fig. 4B, the signal obtained from A3G and HBc-Y132A-HA was not affected when RNA of HepG2 or HepG2.2.15 cells was added.

(2004) demonstrated that A3G binds to the HIV-1 Gag, but they also demonstrated that Gag/APOBEC3G complex is immunoprecipitated from cell lysate after RNase treatment. So we questioned whether HBV RNA or cellular RNA benefited from the interaction between A3G and HBc. We again used SPR to detect this relationship and certified that this binding was enhanced by neither the HepG2 cell RNA nor the HepG2.2.15 cell RNA. A possibility exists that the interaction is not dependent on RNA. These results are consistent with reports that the interaction between A3G and HIV-1 Gag is RNA-independent (Soros et al., 2007).",

HBc can directly incorporate into the viral core that becomes the nucleus for reverse transcription upon infection of a cell. Schlicht et al. (1989) reported that the deletion of 36 amino acids from the carboxy terminus of the duck HBc abolished genome replication, although mutant cores formed capsid particles competent for genome packaging. Mutant proteins truncated to amino acid 163 or 164 packaged RNA but drastically reduced DNA synthesis (Nassal, 1992). These observations suggest that interactions with the HBc proteins can affect several steps in genome replication. Here we used different methods and certified that A3G can directly interact with HBc. This reveals that one of the mechanisms of A3G suppressing HBV DNA synthesis may be through binding core proteins directly.",

Our findings define a mechanism that A3G is incorporated into HBV nucleocapsids through binding the HBc protein. However, further studies are necessary to determine the interaction domains of A3G and HBc. Taken together, our results provide further insights into the inhibition of HBV replication by A3G. The binding sites in A3G proteins or HBc are attractive topics for the development of new antiretroviral agents. This investigation may facilitate the lead to progress in the making of a new approach for controlling HBV infection.",
