Nonetheless, we can attempt to estimate this based on the available data. As of February 29, 2020, a total of 2,870 patients with confirmed COVID-19 have died (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/; accessed March 1, 2020). It is assumed that all of these patients died in ICUs, as most, if not all, of them should have been admitted to the ICU before their death. We estimate that, if using a mortality rate of 50% among patients who were admitted to the ICU, a total of 5,740 patients would have been admitted to the ICU (2,870 \u00d7 2 = 5,740) as of February 29, 2020. One recent report showed a mortality rate of 61.5% in patients who were admitted to the ICU.3 The other report showed a mortality rate of 49% among critically ill patients.8 We used a mortality rate of 50% in our estimate. Based on the data reporting an invasive ventilation rate of approximately 45% in patients who were admitted to the ICU,3,4 we estimate that approximately 2,583 patients with COVID-19 received intubation and invasive ventilation, accounting for approximately 3.2% (2,583 of 79,824) of all confirmed COVID-19 cases, as of February 29, 2020, in mainland China.",

It can also be a decision that lacks quality evidence for guidance and, thus, is a decision made at the discretion of the treating physician. In patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19, it can be challenging when deciding whether to proceed with intubation and invasive ventilation. The Chinese Society of Anesthesiology Task Force on Airway Management released a fast-track publication with the recommendation to proceed with endotracheal intubation for patients showing no improvement in respiratory distress, tachypnea (respiratory rate greater than 30 per minute), and poor oxygenation (Pao2 to Fio2 ratio less than 150 mmHg) after 2-h high-flow oxygen therapy or noninvasive ventilation.9",

The frontline physicians taking care of critically ill patients in Wuhan suggest that intubation and invasive ventilation may have been adversely delayed in some patients. They are concerned that, amid this particular outbreak, intubation is more often used as a salvage therapy than a proactive means of supporting patients whose oxygenation is progressively declining and oxygen debt keeps increasing. The most recent report showed that, among the 22 ICU patients who were intubated, 19 (86%) of them died.3 Although most frontline physicians believe the decision of intubation in some critically ill patients with COVID-19 had been adversely delayed, we do not know at this time if early intubation could save more lives. We do know, based on the work performed 30 yr ago by Shoemaker et al., that there is a close association between the oxygen debt accumulated over 48 h and the chance of survival in patients undergoing high-risk surgery and ICU admission afterward.10 Shoemaker et al.\u2019s work highlights the importance of timely stopping an enlarging oxygen debt using effective oxygenation and ventilation therapies.",

We added liberal criteria, including Spo2 less than 93% in room air and a Pao2 to Fio2 ratio less than 300 mmHg, to facilitate preparedness for intubation based on the experience of taking care of critically ill patients in Wuhan. This proposal is justified as unprepared emergent intubation carries more risks, including cross-infection. It is also justified by the observation that some patients are relatively asymptomatic although they have a good degree of hypoxemia for inexplicable reasons (referred to as \u201csilent hypoxemia\u201d in Wuhan).11 Silent hypoxemia may be responsible for the quick deterioration in some patients because it gives a false sense of well-being when the oxygen debt has been actually and asymptomatically increasing. This algorithm emphasizes vigilance by asking two questions for patients with respiratory distress or hypoxemia. One is whether the condition has been progressively deteriorating or if it is expected to get worse; if the answer is yes, the next question is whether 2-h high-flow oxygen therapy or noninvasive ventilation is effective.",

The other three providers likely contracted the infection from family members. All five providers have recovered. Since the establishment of the self-protection mandate in January 2020, no anesthesia providers in Tongji Hospital have contracted the infection. Dr. Shanglong Yao, a well-known anesthesiologist and former vice president of the Union Hospital in Wuhan, was diagnosed with COVID-19, with the infection likely transmitted from his daughter. Dr. Yao was hospitalized for a prolonged 4 weeks for close observation of the new-onset atrial fibrillation and poorly controlled hypertension. He eventually recovered and was discharged home (fig. 6). These are just some examples of the situations related to the healthcare providers who were infected.",

Intravenous lidocaine, 1.5 mg/kg or more, is effective in suppressing coughing during endotracheal intubation.20 Use a small dose of etomidate (0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg) for patients with hemodynamic instability or propofol (1 to 1.5 mg/kg) for patients with stable hemodynamics for induction.9 Some providers may opt to avoid etomidate due to concerns of adrenal suppression.

Fentanyl 50 to 100 mcg, sufentanil 10 to 20 mcg, or remifentanil 2.5 mcg/kg21 may be used to suppress laryngeal reflexes and optimize the intubation condition. Because opioids have the potential to cause coughing,22 some providers prefer to give opioids after the accomplishment of satisfactory muscle relaxation. The choice and dose of anesthetics should be determined on a case-by-case basis, with the patient\u2019s hemodynamic stability, severity of illness, and mental status taken into consideration. Vasoactive drugs should be readily available to treat extreme cardiovascular reactions. Ventilation through a patent airway and using a small tidal volume should be continued throughout the induction process until the patient is intubated. The goal is to have the patient intubated within 60 s after administration of muscle relaxants.9 The rationale behind modified rapid sequence induction in China is to shorten the period of potentially ineffective ventilation, from the moment of losing consciousness to the moment of successful endotracheal intubation, in critically ill patients with minimal to no oxygen reserve due to COVID-19.",

It is appropriate to be conservative with intravenous fluids in patients with severe lung injury if there are no signs of tissue hypoperfusion.29 Conservative fluid therapy is the strategy used in Wuhan. It is important to avoid corticosteroid treatment, given that this treatment has been shown to increase mortality and hospital-acquired infections in patients with severe influenza.47\u201349 However, the most recent study suggested that early dexamethasone administration may reduce overall mortality and mechanical ventilation duration in ARDS patients.50 Corticosteroid treatment is currently used in selected patients with severe inflammatory lung injury in Wuhan. Disconnecting the patient from the ventilator results in loss of PEEP and atelectasis, and it should be avoided.

A recent review concluded that the potential of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in reducing mortality in patients with ARDS due to H1N1 infection was apparent and that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation should be used as a salvage option in severely hypoxemic ARDS patients.52 The Conventional Ventilation or ECMO for Severe Adult Respiratory Failure (CESAR) trial showed that there is a potential role for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation\u2013based management protocols in patients with severe but potentially reversible respiratory failure, and these protocols may improve survival without causing severe disabilities.53 The ECMO to Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS (EOLIA) trial showed that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was not able to significantly reduce 60-day mortality in patients with very severe ARDS;54 however, the post hoc Bayesian analysis suggested a potential mortality benefit under a broad set of assumptions.55 Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has been used in some critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan. More than 40 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cases (combined) have been treated in Zhongnan Hospital, Jin Yin Tan Hospital, and Lung Hospital in Wuhan. The outcomes of these patients remain to be analyzed.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak is a sweeping and unprecedented challenge in China. Its impacts are currently rapidly unfolding outside of China. As of March 4, 2020, COVID-19 was confirmed in 80,409 patients and led to 3,012 deaths in mainland China. Approximately 3.2% of patients with COVID-19 received intubation and invasive ventilation support. How to provide the best practices of intubation and ventilation amid this mass medical emergency is a real but unprecedented question. In this article, we summarize the firsthand experience pertinent to intubation and ventilation management from the physicians who are taking care of the critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan. In patients with acute refractory hypoxemic respiratory failure, timely, but not premature, intubation and invasive ventilation support may be superior to high-flow oxygen therapy and bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation in boosting transpulmonary pressure, opening collapsed alveoli, improving oxygenation, decreasing oxygen debt, and offering a better chance for the lungs to heal. The invasive nature of intubation and ventilation exposes patients to an augmented risk of procedure-related mishaps. At the same time, these procedures present healthcare providers with an enhanced risk of cross-infection; thus, strict self-protection precautions are mandatory.",
