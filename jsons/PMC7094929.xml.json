One of the most critical clinical and public health questions during the emergence of a completely novel pathogen, especially one that could cause a global pandemic, pertains to the spectrum of illness presentation or severity profile. For the patient and clinician, this affects triage and diagnostic decision-making, especially in settings without ready access to laboratory testing or when surge capacity has been exceeded. It also influences therapeutic choice and prognostic expectations. For managers of health services, it is important for rapid forward planning in terms of procurement of supplies, readiness of human resources to staff beds at different intensities of care and generally ensuring the sustainability of the health system through the peak and duration of the epidemic.",

Specifically, delineating the proportion of infections that are clinically unobserved under different circumstances is critical to refining model parameterization. In turn, estimates of both the observed and unobserved infections are essential for informing the development and evaluation of public health strategies, which need to be traded off against economic, social and personal freedom costs. For example, drastic social distancing and mobility restrictions, such as school closures and travel advisories/bans, should only be considered if an accurate estimation of case fatality risk warrants these interventions, which seriously disrupt social and economic stability.",

Even under more realistic assumptions about mixing informed by observed clustering of infections within households and the increasingly apparent role of superspreading events (for example, the Diamond Princess cruise ship, Chinese prisons and the church in Daegu, South Korea)5,6, at least one-quarter to one-half of the population will very likely become infected, absent drastic control measures or a vaccine. Therefore, the number of severe outcomes or deaths in the population is most strongly dependent on how ill an infected person is likely to become, and this question should be the focus of attention.",

Estimation of true case numbers\u2014necessary to determine the severity per case\u2014is challenging in the setting of an overwhelmed healthcare system that cannot ascertain cases effectively. Therefore, as in our prior work4, our approach has been to use a range of publicly available and recently published data sources (numbered 1 to 8 below) to build a picture of the full number of cases and deaths by age group. Briefly, because the healthcare structure has been overwhelmed in Wuhan and milder cases were unlikely to have been tested, we used the prevalence of infection in travelers (both on commercial flights before 19 January and on charter flights from 29 January to 4 February) to estimate the true prevalence of infection in Wuhan; we also used the Wuhan case numbers from only the first 425 cases to estimate the growth rate of the epidemic (assuming that the ascertainment proportion was constant between 10 December 2019 and 3 January 2020) (Fig. 1).",

            "text": "There is a clear and considerable age dependency in symptomatic infection (susceptibility) and outcome (fatality) risks, by multiple folds in each case. Given that we have parameterized the model using death rates inferred from projected case numbers (from traveler data) and observed death numbers in Wuhan, the precise fatality risk estimates may not be generalizable to those outside the original epicenter, especially during subsequent phases of the epidemic. The experience gained from managing those initial patients and the increasing availability of newer, and potentially better, treatment modalities to more patients would presumably lead to fewer deaths, all else being equal. Public health control measures widely imposed in China since the Wuhan alert have also kept case numbers down elsewhere, so that their health systems are not nearly as overwhelmed beyond surge capacity, thus again perhaps leading to better outcomes6,8. Indeed, so far, the death-to-case ratio in Wuhan has been consistently much higher than that among all the other mainland Chinese cities (Extended Data Fig. 2). Given the intensive efforts of case finding and the sharp drop in community transmission of COVID-19 in Chinese cities outside Hubei over the past few weeks, the ascertainment rates in these cities were probably very high. As such, we postulate that confirmed case fatality risk in these cities should be in some ways comparable to our sCFR estimates for Wuhan, which attempt to account for under-ascertainment of cases in Wuhan. Nonetheless, crude case fatality risks estimated from cities outside Wuhan should be, and are, lower than our sCFR estimates for Wuhan, because the former do not account for the delay between onset and death (thus being artefactually lower) and because healthcare outside Hubei is less overwhelmed (thus allowing a truly lower CFR). Indeed, as of 29 February 2020, the crude case fatality risk in areas outside Hubei was 0.85%, which is ~23\u201341% lower than our sCFR estimates of 1.2\u20131.4% for Wuhan9.",

            "text": "Considering the risk estimates in context, Extended Data Fig. 3 compares infection, case and hospitalization fatality risks for pandemic influenza in 1918 and 2009, SARS and MERS. SARS causes moderate to severe disease requiring hospitalization, so the infection fatality risk and case fatality risk are essentially the same as the hospitalization fatality risk. The hospitalization fatality risk for MERS is well documented, although the shape and depth of the clinical iceberg remains less well defined. In contrast, because (1) the majority of COVID-19 infections do not cause severe disease8 and (2) hospitals in Wuhan have been overwhelmed, presumably having led to prioritized admission of more serious cases, the sCFR will be substantially lower than the HFR. However, despite a lower sCFR, COVID-19 is likely to infect many more (given emerging evidence of presymptomatic transmission14,15 and growing evidence of extensive community spread in numerous countries16), thus ultimately causing many more deaths than SARS and MERS. Compared with the 1918 and 2009 influenza pandemics, our estimates are intermediate but substantially higher than 2009, which was generally regarded as a low-severity pandemic. We find that sCFR is highest in the oldest age group. Unlike any previously reported pandemic or seasonal influenza, we find that risk of symptomatic infection also increases with age, although this may be in part due to preferential ascertainment of older and thus more severe cases. One largely unknown factor at present is the number of asymptomatic, undiagnosed infections. These do not enter our estimates of sCFR, but if such asymptomatic or clinically very mild cases existed and were not detected, the infection fatality risk would be lower than sCFR. Further clarifying this requires new data sources that are not yet available, specifically including age-stratified serologic studies.",

Perhaps the most important target of mitigation measures would be to \u2018flatten out\u2019 the epidemic curve, reducing the peak demand on healthcare services and buying time for better treatment pathways to be developed. In due course, but almost certainly after the first global wave of infections, vaccines may also be available to protect against infection or severe disease. Although our estimates of sCFR are concerning, these could be reduced if effective antivirals were identified and widely adopted for the treatment of severe cases. Timely data from clinical trials of remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir and other potential chemotherapies, as well as supportive care modalities, would be extremely informative.",

On the one hand, overstretched and overwhelmed healthcare surge capacity in Wuhan could result in sCFRs that are higher than they would be in a less stressed healthcare setting, as presumably the sicker patients would have been prioritized for admission while leaving the milder cases untested and thus unconfirmed. Our prevalence estimates relying on travelers are based on those well enough to travel, so may slightly underestimate prevalence in Wuhan by not including those who are already in a serious condition and perhaps hospitalized. We have accounted for the possibility that travelers may underestimate the prevalence of infection in Wuhan17 by using our best estimate, from a separate analysis, of the probability of detection for international travelers (38% (22\u201364%))17. On the other hand, the numerator of the number of deaths could also have been undercounted, although much less likely compared to enumerating the denominator, for the same surge capacity reason or due to imperfect test sensitivity, especially during the first month of the outbreak18. If deaths in Wuhan were under-ascertained, this would bias our severity estimates downward.",

Their point prevalence might well be lower than that among local residents, because of a generally more advantaged socioeconomic background, and the sensitivity for detecting infected individuals among them might not be 100%, as assumed. As such, this would be a lower bound of the cross-sectional disease prevalence. If this were the case, then we would have overestimated the reduction in transmissibility conferred by public health interventions in Wuhan and overestimated the severity. Based on only publicly available data, there is necessarily substantial uncertainty in our estimates of the effectiveness of intra-Wuhan public health interventions in reducing transmissibility. Calculating the instantaneous reproductive number from a set of line lists that are updated daily would be the most reliable method for detecting changes in transmissibility associated with interventions.",
