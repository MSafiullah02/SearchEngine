IFN-ls thereby help to maintain healthy mucosal surfaces through immune protection, without the significant immune-related pathogenic risk associated with type I IFN responses. Type III IFNs also target the human liver, with dual effects: they induce an antiviral state in hepatocytes, but specific IFN-l4 action impairs the clearance of hepatitis C virus and could influence inflammatory responses.

            "text": "Upon infection by viruses, mammals (including humans) react by producing interferons (IFNs), which induce an antiviral state in infected and yet-uninfected cells to block viral replication and spread of the infection. Mammals possess three classes of IFNs: type I (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2), type II (IFN-\u03b3) and type III (IFN-\u03bbs). The direct antiviral effects of type II IFN are limited, but it has pleiotropic effects on a diverse set of immune cells promoting both adaptive and innate responses. Type I and III IFNs induce a strong antiviral state in responsive cells by initiating a transcriptional program that regulates the expression of several hundred genes. Whereas almost all nucleated cells respond to type I IFN, responses to type III IFNs are restricted to tissues with a high risk of viral exposure and infection, such as those at mucosal surfaces. This allows type III IFNs to selectively induce a strong antiviral state in high-risk tissues at a limited inflammatory cost for the host organism. Here we review the role of IFN-\u03bb as the border guard of the body and discuss the putative roles of IFN-\u03bb4. This paradoxical protein is highly antiviral in vitro but impairs clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in vivo and might influence inflammatory processes in the liver.",

We use the current nomenclature here and include the now abandoned nomenclature in parentheses. We list protein names, but the names of their encoding genes are generally equivalent, with the exception that Greek letters are replaced by Latin letters (for example, the IFN-\u03bb1 protein is encoded by the IFNL1 gene). In humans, the type III IFN family consists of four members: IFN-\u03bb1 (IL-29), IFN-\u03bb2 (IL28A), IFN-\u03bb3 (IL-28B) and IFN-\u03bb4 (ref. 4 ). Mice have two functional genes encoding IFN-\u03bb (Ifnl2 and Ifnl3) and two Ifnl1 pseudogenes Ifnl1-P1 and Ifnl1-P2 (Fig. 1) . The IFN-\u03bb receptor complex is composed of the specific IFN-\u03bb receptor chain 1 (IFN-\u03bbR1 (IL28RA)) and the shared IL-10 receptor chain 2 (IL-10R2 (IL-10R\u03b2)).",

This event creates docking sites for STAT1 and STAT2 signaling molecules, which leads to their recruitment and subsequent phosphorylation 1, 2, 5 . The phosphorylated STATs recruit IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), which together form IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which enters the nucleus and drives the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Despite using different receptors, both type I and III IFNs activate ISGF3 (ref. 6) and therefore induce highly similar transcriptional responses [6] [7] [8] [9] . IFNAR2 (part of the type I IFN receptor complex (Fig. 2) ) interacts directly with the IFN-induced protein Usp18, which inhibits the response to IFN-\u03b1 10 but not to IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03bb 11,12 , thereby creating, at least in human cells, a negative feedback loop for IFN-\u03b1. In accordance with this, IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb elicit prolonged responses in cell cultures, whereas the response to IFN-\u03b1 is shorter in duration 13, 14 . However, a different study showed an inhibitory effect of Usp18 on IFN-\u03bb induction of some (but not all) ISGs tested in the mouse system 15 .",

Mouse liver shows no expression of IFN\u03bbR1 and no responsiveness to IFN-\u03bb in vivo 22, 23 , but liver cells derived from mice require the IFN\u03bbR1 receptor for efficient control of viral replication 24 . In humans, mucosal epithelial tissues as well as the liver respond to type III IFNs 25, 26 . Type III IFN responses in immune cells are still being investigated and are discussed below. Differential splicing of the IFNLR1 gene gives rise to three mRNAs. Variant 1 leads to the expression of the functional receptor; variant 2 lacks a part of the intracellular domain and is nonfunctional; variant 3 encodes only the extracellular part of the receptor 27 . The product of variant 3 is released from cells and can act as a decoy receptor and potentially downregulate type III IFN responses 28 , but the physiological role of splice variants 2 and 3 are not yet well established. Interestingly, epigenetic silencing seems to block the induction of IFNLR1 in nonresponsive tissues 29 , but more work is needed to understand the mechanisms regulating IFNLR1 induction and the physiological role of its splice variants.",

IFNL1, unlike IFNB1, possesses a cluster of distal NF-\u03baB sites that are necessary for maximal IFNL1 transcription and could stimulate IFNL1 gene induction in an IRF-independent manner 45 . In colon and respiratory epithelial cells, ZEB1 was identified as a selective repressor of IFNL1 transcription, suggesting a key difference between regulation of type I and III IFN expression 46, 47 . Furthermore, induction of type III IFNs can also be initiated via the signaling adaptor MAVS when it is associated with peroxisomes 48 . The involvement of peroxisomes in the induction of type III IFNs is interesting, as RIG-I-like receptor signaling via MAVS on peroxisomes does not drive the induction of type I IFNs but induces expression of ISGs 49 . In human hepatocytes infected with HCV or treated with poly(I:C), the induction of IFNL2 and IFNL3 was dependent on IRF3 and IRF7, whereas the induction of IFNL1 was also dependent on NF-\u03baB 50 . Finally, another group has identified Med23, a subunit of the mediator complex 51 , as a direct interaction partner for IRF7 (ref. 52 ). Med23 and IRF7 synergistically increase IFNL transcription but have no effect on IFNB1.",

The redundant and unique roles of type I and type III IFNs have also been investigated. Not surprisingly, viral tropism is the major determinant of the relative contribution of each IFN type. Gut epithelial cells respond exclusively to type III IFN 21 , and the type III IFN system mediates control of epitheliotropic viruses, such as rotaviruses, in a nonredundant fashion 21 . Reoviruses initiate their infection in the gut epithelia but can penetrate the epithelial layer and infect cells in the lamina propria or cause a systemic infection in mice. Type III IFN restricts the initial replication in the gut epithelium and diminishes the shedding of virus through feces, Figure 1 Genomic organization of the type III IFNs in mice and humans. The mouse Ifnl loci are found on chromosome 7 and contain the functional genes Ifnl2 and Ifnl3, and the pseudogenes Ifnl1-P1 and Ifnl1-P2. The duplication of the mouse locus occurred independently from that of the human IFNL locus, so mouse Ifnl2 and Ifln3 cannot be considered true orthologs of human IFNL2 and IFNL3. In humans the IFNL loci are located on the long arm of chromosome 19. In humans IFNL1, IFNL2 and IFNL3 are functional genes, and IFNL4 is a pseudogene in part of the population owing to the SNP rs368234815. Additionally this locus encodes the pseudogenes INFL1P1 and IFNL4P1. SNPs associated with HCV clearance rates are indicated with either their common names or the consequence of the variation in parentheses. The genes IFNL2, IFNL3, IFNL4 and IFNL4P1 were probably generated by a duplication event, whereby the region containing IFNL3 and IFNL4 was duplicated to generate IFNL4P1 and IFNL2, or vice versa. The recombination site localizes between IFNL4 and IFNL4P1. Exons are shown in green; arrows indicate the direction of transcription. Pseudogenes are indicated by gray boxes with the symbol \u03a8 and are not drawn to scale (except for IFNL4P1). All human pseudogenes contain introns and are thus not the result of retro-transposition.",

The protective effect of type III IFN is counteracted by gut commensals 55 , which explains why wild-type mice with a functional type III IFN system are still susceptible to norovirus. Sterilizing the gut by antibiotic treatment renders mice more resistant to norovirus in a type III IFN-dependent manner 55 . Many viruses are released and spread from epithelial surfaces; one could thus expect a role for type III IFN in viral transmission, something that should be studied more closely in the future. An early study of the IFN-\u03bbR1 knockout mouse revealed a deficiency in the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)-and TLR9-mediated antiviral defense during vaginal infection with herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) but not during systemic viral infection 56 . Thus, type III IFNs have a role in the vaginal epithelia, but further studies are required in this area. An indirect anti-West Nile Virus effect of type III IFN was reported, in which tight junction integrity of mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells and maintenance of the blood brain barrier required IFN-\u03bbR1, thus limiting neuroinvasion 57 . This effect seems to occur through a noncanonical signaling pathway that requires IFN-\u03bbR1 but not STAT1 or protein synthesis. The compartmentalization of type I and III IFNs is less black and white in the respiratory tract, where there is a degree of redundancy between the two IFN systems 18, 58 . Studies on mice deficient in IFN-\u03bbR1, IFNAR1 or both showed that mice lacking both (receptor double-deficient mice) were highly susceptible to respiratory infections, whereas single-deficient mice were largely as resistant as wild-type mice. This indicates a higher degree of redundancy of the two IFN systems in the respiratory tract than in the gastrointestinal tract. Infection of airway epithelial cells in vitro and subsequent measures of the IFN-induced transcriptional signature by microarray showed that the influenza-induced IFN signature was abolished only in receptor double-deficient epithelia 9 , thus confirming the redundancy observed in vivo. Thus, airway epithelia express receptors for both IFN types, whereas some or all gut epithelial cells seem to express only IFN-\u03bb receptors.",

One may speculate that the gut, with its high risk of uncontrolled inflammation owing to the vast burden of microbe-associated molecular patterns derived from commensals, is a compartment where it is desirable to keep local responses 'below the radar' of systemic immunity. In contrast, in the lungs, which are not sterile but certainly have a bacterial burden several orders of magnitude below that of the intestines, the compartmentalization of the two IFN systems is less strict. During influenza virus infection mouse airway epithelia produce higher amounts of type III IFNs than type I IFNs 9,41 . Therefore, as long as lung epithelial cells are the main IFN producers, the response may be dominated by type III IFNs. However, once immune cells start producing IFN, the response may shift toward being driven by type I IFN. Thus, the division of labor between type III and type I IFNs in the lung might not be as strict as in the gut but seems to follow a similar pattern.",

Similarly, only some subsets of myeloid immune cells, such as human monocyte-derived macrophages 61 , pDCs [60] [61] [62] and some dendritic cell subsets in humans and in mice 63 , respond directly to type III IFN. For natural killer (NK) cells, reports have come to opposite conclusions about the ability of type III IFNs to influence IFN-\u03b3 secretion by NK cells [64] [65] [66] . However, adoptive transfer experiments in mice using IFN-\u03bbR1-deficient (Ifnlr1 \u2212/\u2212 ) NK cells Figure 2 Signaling pathway of type I and type III IFNs. Type I IFNs signal via a heterodimeric receptor composed of the high-affinity chain IFNAR2 and the low-affinity chain IFNAR1. Type III IFNs also signal via a heterodimeric receptor, but it is composed of two different chains: the IFN-\u03bbR1 high-affinity chain and IL-10R2 low-affinity chain (which is shared with other cytokines). Both high-affinity chains interact with JAK1, whereas the two low-affinity chains interact with TYK2. Signaling downstream of both receptors results in the assembly of the ISGF3 transcription factor, which coordinates the expression of genes containing an interferon response element (ISRE). Epithelial and immune responses to viral infection in the lung. (a) When respiratory viruses infect airway epithelia, these cells can establish an antiviral state through the autocrine and paracrine action of type I or type III IFNs. Both types are produced by epithelia, which also express the IFN-\u03bb receptor. In cases where this response is dominated by IFN-\u03bb, the epithelial antiviral state can be established without systemic immune cell activation. (b) Immune cell activation, such as when immune cells are strongly recruited into the infected lung or when they are exposed to virus, can trigger a type I IFN-driven immune response. Because type I IFN has pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects, many cell types are activated, with wide-ranging consequences. Only myeloid immune cells are shown here, but innate and adaptive lymphoid populations are activated in addition. Appropriate type I IFN-driven responses will activate innate and adaptive immune functions and lead to virus elimination. The inflammatory processes involved also have pathogenic potential and can therefore lead to immune-mediated epithelial damage. iMC, inflammatory monocyte; AM, alveolar macrophage.",

HCV causes chronic infection in approximately 75% of people, whereas the remaining individuals manage to clear the infection within the first year 86 . The host genetic background is important for both spontaneous and treatment-induced clearance of the virus. In 2009, several independent consortia, using rather different HCVinfected cohorts, mapped the major genetic determinant of HCV clearance in response to treatment with IFN-\u03b1 plus ribavirin to the type III IFN loci [87] [88] [89] [90] . The same association was found in spontaneous clearance of the virus 90, 91 . However, two different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified as the best predictor of treatment outcome: rs8099917 (shortened hereafter to 917) best predicted the outcome in Asians and people of European descent, whereas rs12979860 (shortened hereafter to 860) was the best predictor in a US cohort of mixed ethnicity (Fig. 1) . Both SNPs were originally described as IL28B-related (i.e., IFNL3-related), and they were surprisingly not in complete linkage disequilibrium (meaning that they are not inherited together), as would be expected if they represented the same underlying causative genetic defect. What was more surprising was that only one of the SNPs identified was located within the encoding regions of known type III IFNs (changing Lys70 in IFN-\u03bb3 to arginine, which had no effect on the function of IFN-\u03bb3) 92 . These findings led to the speculation that these SNPs represented changes in the IFNL3 promoter region and caused differences in IFN-\u03bb3 expression. However, subsequent studies came to divergent conclusions about the SNPs' influence on IFN-\u03bb3 expression, and this issue is still not fully resolved.",

            "text": "A breakthrough came with the discovery of the IFNL4 gene situated within the region determining HCV clearance. It was found that the SNP rs368234815 was superior to SNP 860 in predicting treatment outcome in individuals of African ancestry. The TT allele of rs368234815 disrupts the open reading frame of IFNL4 and is protective in terms of HCV, whereas the ancestral '\u2206G' allele encodes a functional IFN-\u03bb4 and impairs HCV clearance. This finding suggests that IFN-\u03bb4 is the causative agent of HCV clearance failure, but it does not explain why the SNP 917 is a powerful predictor of the treatment outcome in several other populations. The discovery of a second SNP acting in combination with the \u2206G SNP resolved this discrepancy. The SNP rs117648444 (shortened hereafter to 444) represents a nonsynonymous change in the coding region of IFNL4, where a proline residue is replaced by serine, resulting in two versions of IFN-\u03bb4: the fully active IFN-\u03bb4-P70 and a much less active IFN-\u03bb4-S70 (ref. 93) . By combining the \u2206G and 444 SNPs, one can stratify patients into three groups: (i) those having no IFN-\u03bb4, (ii) those having IFN-\u03bb4-P70 and (iii) those having IFN-\u03bb4-S70. Compared to the single SNPs described previously, this stratification led to a significant improvement in the predictive power of genotyping and reflects the existence of a set of distinct haplotypes in humans (a haplotype is a set of tightly linked alleles that are likely to be inherited together). Before the discovery of the IFNL4 gene, elegant work identified the probable causative haplotype by massive parallel sequencing 94 . In people of European ancestry, this haplotype is specifically tagged by SNP 917 and encodes the IFN-\u03bb4-P70 variant, whereas the 860 SNP marks several haplotypes encoding both the P70 and S70 variants of IFN-\u03bb4 but not the frameshift mutation. In both cases, the patient group having IFN-\u03bb4-S70 is somewhat neglected, and the apparent discrepancy can be resolved by genotyping and stratification as described above. Notably, this has been done only for one European HCV-infected cohort so far, and its repetition in different cohorts will be important. In particular, the impact of the IFN-\u03bb4-S70 variant might differ among diseases and ethnic backgrounds. In summary, the higher rate of HCV clearance in patients encoding the IFN-\u03bb4-S70 variant than in patients with IFN-\u03bb4-P70 strongly suggests that the activity of the IFN-\u03bb4 protein causes, by yet unknown means, poor HCV clearance.",

            "text": "The effect of IFNL4 genotype is not restricted to IFN-based therapies for HCV; it also extends to direct-acting antiviral-based treatments [95] [96] [97] [98] [99] . Furthermore, IFNL4 genotype also influences the reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) in immune-suppressed patients 100, 101 . The data are clear but paradoxical. IFN-\u03bb4 signals through the same receptor that other members of the type III IFN family do, and its effect is highly similar. Furthermore, IFN-\u03bb4 is antiviral in vitro 102 . Nevertheless, having a functional IFNL4 gene renders humans less capable of clearing chronic infections such as HCV and CMV. It is likely that IFN-\u03bb4 directly or indirectly influences inflammatory responses and, thereby, viral clearance. Several studies have reported increased liver inflammation and fibrosis [103] [104] [105] [106] and increased degranulation activity of lymphocytes 107 in HCV patients with the protective IFNL4 genotype (the TT allele, which destroys the open reading frame of IFNL4), suggesting that IFN-\u03bb4 impairs HCV clearance but diminishes liver inflammation and fibrosis. Other studies did not find any association or had directly conflicting data but used smaller cohorts. Interestingly, a study has found that decreased liver inflammation and fibrosis was associated with having a functional IFNL4 gene in a nonalcoholic fatty liver disease cohort, indicating that the effect of IFN-\u03bb4 on inflammation could be independent of viral infection 104 . However, this finding needs confirmation from other studies. We are currently incapable of offering a mechanistic explanation. Figure 4 Phylogenetic tree of IFN-\u03bb based on actual or predicted protein sequences. We selected species so that they represented different branches of the mammalian clade. We selected one species of marsupials (gray shorttailed opossum; representing early mammalian evolution) and three representative species from the superorder Laurasiatheria (ferret, pig, hedgehog) as well as mouse and human, which we deal with in this review and represent the two major branches of the superorder Euarchontoglires. For the analysis, we kept the protein names as found in the NCBI database and only added numbers to proteins that had redundant names. The sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/ muscle/), and the tree was generated by the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The IFNL4 gene became a liability during human evolution A report identified IFN-\u03bb4 sequences in most mammalian species, with the notable exception of rodents 108 . Phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 4) reveal that the IFN-\u03bb4 family constitutes a separate clade in the type III IFN tree. In contrast, IFN-\u03bbs 1-3 do not form separate clades but group according to species. This suggests that the ancestor of mammals had an IFNL4-like gene and a second gene that was independently duplicated several times during mammalian evolution, giving rise to IFNL1, IFNL2 and IFNL3. Thus, mouse IFN-\u03bb2 cannot be considered a strict ortholog of human IFN-\u03bb2, etc., similarly to what is seen for IFN-\u03b1.",

This observation raises several interesting questions. Why did IFNL4 suddenly become a liability? What drove (and still drives) the pseudogenization of IFNL4?

A successful phase II trial showed that IFN-\u03bb1 was as effective or more so than PEGylated IFN-\u03b1 and had significantly fewer extrahepatic adverse events 59 . However, the successful development of several direct-acting antivirals is changing the therapeutic landscape for HCV, and IFN is likely to have a less dominant role in the future. However, several phase III trials are currently under way in which PEGylated IFN-\u03bb1 is combined with direct-acting antivirals (telaprevir, asunaprevir or daclatasvir). Type III IFN could represent a promising future antiviral treatment for some infections with epithelial tropism, as the immunopathological side effects should be minimal. Type III IFN could be useful as a therapy for respiratory infections caused by viruses such as influenza virus or coronaviruses (SARS and MERS) 74, 110 , and for intestinal infection caused by noroviruses or rotaviruses 54 . Future clinical studies are needed to test the usefulness of type III IFN against these infections and explore the effects of different delivery methods. However, the discovery of IFN-\u03bb4 is also a cautionary lesson, as it appears that in some settings, type III IFN could contribute to increased risk rather than protection from chronic infection.",

            "text": "Type III IFN clearly has an important role in protecting the epithelial surfaces from viral infection, but a number of interesting issues remain to be addressed. Given that lung epithelia respond to both type I and type III IFN, what is the distribution of work between these IFN systems in the respiratory epithelia? Humans are frequently challenged with viruses of low or medium pathogenicity, and the particular strength of the type III IFN system might be its ability to deal with these infections without creating severe inflammation or tissue damage. But conclusions drawn from experiments with mice in a highly controlled laboratory environment run the risk of ignoring some of the complexity found in real life. Therefore, in answering future questions, researchers should consider using complex models that allow for viral and bacterial coinfection as well as recurrent infection with several different viruses. Emerging evidence suggests an interaction between type III IFN and the adaptive immune system, but how this occurs is not yet clear. One can imagine direct and indirect effects of type III IFN, through influencing the production of other cytokines, such as IL-12, or via effects on antigen-presenting cells. It will be exciting to follow the development in this area in the coming years. The role of the paradoxical IFN-\u03bb4 in the type III IFN family is currently unclear. There is strong genetic evidence that IFN-\u03bb4 inhibits clearance of chronic viral infections such as HCV and CMV, but at present there is little or no mechanistic understanding of how this occurs.",

(a) When respiratory viruses infect airway epithelia, these cells can establish an antiviral state through the autocrine and paracrine action of type I or type III IFNs. Both types are produced by epithelia, which also express the IFN-\u03bb receptor. In cases where this response is dominated by IFN-\u03bb, the epithelial antiviral state can be established without systemic immune cell activation. (b) Immune cell activation, such as when immune cells are strongly recruited into the infected lung or when they are exposed to virus, can trigger a type I IFN-driven immune response. Because type I IFN has pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects, many cell types are activated, with wide-ranging consequences. Only myeloid immune cells are shown here, but innate and adaptive lymphoid populations are activated in addition. Appropriate type I IFN-driven responses will activate innate and adaptive immune functions and lead to virus elimination. The inflammatory processes involved also have pathogenic potential and can therefore lead to immune-mediated epithelial damage. iMC, inflammatory monocyte; AM, alveolar macrophage.",
