The standard laboratory method to diagnose PCP remains the microscopic identification of Pneumocystis jirovecii (Pj) by staining methods in respiratory samples. However, studies highlighted the low burden of Pj in non-HIV immunocompromised patients [3] and the lack of sensitivity of microscopic methods [4]. This justifies the increasing use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for diagnosis [5, 6]. The detection of Pj in individuals presenting without pneumonia or with pneumonia from another etiology has been defined as colonization or \u201ccarriage\u201d [7]. Conventional Pj PCR is qualitative and very sensitive, but does not differentiate between active PCP and Pj colonization.",

Previous studies determined various cut-offs of qPCR targeting different genes to discriminate PCP from colonization: for MSG gene, Larsen et al. proved that a cut-off value of 50 copies/tube for qPCR in oral-wash samples increased the specificity for diagnosis of PCP to 100 % [18]. Flori et al.\u2019s study established that a cut-off of 103 copies of DNA per capillary of BAL (PCR targeting the MSG gene) increased the specificity from 84.9 to 98.6 % with 100 % sensitivity [4]. Other studies highlighted the usefulness of qPCR in discriminating colonization from PCP: Alanio et al. proposed two cut-off values (120 and 1,900 trophic forms equivalents/ml) with a qPCR targeting the mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA gene [22]; for Matsumura et al., the value of 1,300 copies/ml distinguished PCP from colonization with a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 80 %, using qPCR targeting the DHPS (dihydropteroate synthase) gene [23].",

Without a test capable of confirming or excluding the diagnosis of PCP, the classification of patients is uncertain. However, one quality of our study is that patients were classified by a multidisciplinary group of experts, ruling by consensus in view of all the clinical and complementary data. The fact that the experts did not know the qPCR results avoids classification bias. In spite of the small number of patients, the observed differences between the groups are statistically significant, which suggests that these differences are important. In our study, we used qPCR targeting the MSG gene, which is appropriate in discuss PCP diagnosis: the sensitivity is excellent, and it has been proved that qPCR analysis and the MSG target have the highest specificity compared with other PCR assays [24].",
