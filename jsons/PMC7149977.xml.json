Quite separately, the early microscopists began to make observations on objects too small to be seen by the naked eye. Foremost among these was the Dutchman Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632\u20131723). With his remarkable home-made and hand-held microscope, he found many micro-organisms in materials such as water, mud, saliva and the intestinal contents of healthy subjects, and recognized them as living creatures (\u2018animalcules\u2019) because they swam about actively. That he saw bacteria as well as the larger microbes is known from his measurements of their size (\u2018one-sixth the diameter of a red blood corpuscle\u2019).",

The procedure, termed vaccination (Latin vacca = cow) established the concept of immunization in Europe.3John Snow (1813\u20131858) showed that, by preventing access to a water source epidemiologically linked to a cholera outbreak, further infections could be terminated. This established that physical measures could prevent the transmission of infection, a point further illustrated by Ignaz Semmelweis (1818\u20131865) in Vienna and others who showed that fatal streptococcal infections (puerperal fever) affecting mothers following childbirth could be substantially reduced if those attending the birth applied simple hygienic measures.\n",

The brilliant French chemist Louis Pasteur crushed two prevailing dogmas: that the fermentation responsible for alcohol formation was a purely chemical process (by demonstrating that the presence of living micro-organisms was essential), and that life could be spontaneously generated (by showing that nutrient solutions remained sterile if microbes were excluded). Refutation of spontaneous generation established unequivocally that all life must come from progenitors of the same species and, therefore, the need for a chain of transmission where infection is concerned. Pasteur made many other seminal contributions, including the identification of several causal agents of disease and the recognition that microbes could be rendered less capable of causing disease (less virulent) or attenuated by artificial subculture. He used the principle of attenuation to develop a successful vaccine against anthrax for use in animals. It was the influence of Pasteur's work that inspired the British surgeon Joseph Lister (1827\u20131912) to establish antisepsis, aimed at destroying the micro-organisms responsible for infection during surgery.",

Working originally as a country doctor in East Prussia, he established the techniques required to isolate and propagate pure cultures of specific bacteria. His numerous contributions include establishment of the bacterial causes of anthrax, tuberculosis and cholera. He also formulated more precisely proposals first put forward by one of his mentors, Jacob Henle (1809\u20131885), describing how specific microbes might be recognized as the cause of specific diseases. These principles, often referred to as Koch's postulates, are used to substantiate claims that a particular organism causes a specific ailment. They require that:\u2022The organism is demonstrable in every case of the disease.\u2022It can be isolated and propagated in pure culture in vitro.\u2022Inoculation of the pure culture by a suitable route into a suitable host should reproduce the disease.\u2022The organism can be re-isolated from the new host.\n",

Technological breakthroughs, including tissue culture and electron microscopy, were required to enable recognition of viruses. In the early days, viral pathogens were termed filterable agents, because they passed through filters designed to retain bacteria.

The revolution in molecular biology that followed the elucidation of the structure of DNA by James Watson, Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin in 1953 ultimately enabled a leap forward in analytical capability. For three decades this did not radically change the understanding of microbes and infection. However, almost exactly a century after Pasteur and Koch initiated what has been called the \u2018golden era of bacteriology\u2019, three interconnected breakthroughs once again altered the perspective:1The recognition, principally by the American molecular biologist Carl Woese, that ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA), which has essentially the same core structure in all cells, carries unique signatures indicating its evolutionary relationships. It transpires that all cellular forms of life can be classified according to the DNA sequence encoding their rRNA (rDNA). Determination of this sequence provides a means of identifying all microbes and has led to the discovery of a previously unsuspected third \u2018domain\u2019 of life, the Archaea (see Ch. 2).2Technological advances made possible by molecular genetics. The molecular basis for the pathogenesis of infection now enables recognition of the specific roles of individual genes and their products in both the pathogen and the host. This offers the promise of new approaches to treatment and prevention of infection. The discovery of mobile genetic elements that convey genes from one organism to another (see Ch. 6) confronted our biological sense of what makes up an individual. Mobile bacterial genes encoding antibiotic resistance present a major problem to the practice of medicine.3The development of ultra-sensitive means of detecting specific DNA or RNA sequences and the development, by Kary Mullis, of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 1986. The analytical capacity of nucleic acid amplification techniques offers the prospect that it may be possible to diagnose microbial disease routinely by these methods. However, there are many challenges to be met before this shift away from detection of micro-organisms by isolation in laboratory cultures can be accepted.\n",

Nursing practices rooted in almost obsessive cleanliness became the norm and aseptic practice (avoidance of contact between sterile body tissues and materials contaminated with live micro-organisms) was introduced to supplement the use of antisepsis. Before the advent of antibiotics, hygiene was a matter of life and death; institutes of hygiene were established around the world. When treatment of infection later became reliable and routine, hygiene standards were often allowed to drop, leading to present problems, notably with hospital-acquired infection.",

One outcome was the use of antibodies produced in one host for the protection of another (serum therapy). This produced some spectacular successes, notably in the life-saving use of antitoxin in diphtheria and tetanus. Unfortunately these foreign proteins often caused hypersensitivity reactions (serum sickness) and few diseases responded reliably to serum therapy. Nevertheless, the capacity of the immune system to achieve selective toxicity, and observations by the brilliant German doctor Paul Ehrlich (1854\u20131915) that dyes used to stain infected tissues selectively labelled parasites in preference to host tissues, contributed to the notion that systemic chemotherapy might be achievable.",

A more important breakthrough than Ehrlich's came in 1935 with the publication of a paper by Gerhard Domagk (1895\u20131964) of the German dyestuffs consortium, IG Farbenindustrie. Domagk described the remarkable activity against streptococci of a dye derivative, prontosil, which turned out to owe its activity to a sulphonamide substituent previously unsuspected of antibacterial activity. Earlier, in 1928, Alexander Fleming had accidentally discovered the antibacterial properties of a fungal mould Penicillium notatum, but he was unable to purify the active component or exploit the therapeutic potential of his discovery. This was left to a team of scientists at Oxford led by the Australian experimental pathologist Howard Florey (1898\u20131968), heralding the start of the antibiotic era \u2013 the most important therapeutic development of the twentieth century.",

The hunt for antibiotics intensified after the Second World War, yielding chloramphenicol, tetracyclines and many other natural, synthetic and semi-synthetic antibacterial compounds. Progress in the development of antiviral, antifungal and antiparasitic compounds has been much slower, despite the fact that two effective antiprotozoal drugs, quinine (cinchona bark) and emetine (ipecacuanha root), and some natural anthelminthic agents have been recognized for centuries. Therapeutic choice in non-bacterial infection consequently remains severely limited, although the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pandemic has stimulated much work in the antiviral field that has been rewarded with significant success. Meanwhile, the explosion of knowledge in immunology has renewed hopes that it may be possible to manipulate immunological processes triggered by infection to the benefit of the host.",

Thus there are some pathogens for which an association with man is essential in order for them to propagate, whereas for others human association is of little significance compared with their propagation in other species or environments. Microbes that depend on human beings are obligate parasites. A few actually need to cause disease to propagate themselves; these are termed obligate pathogens. In most cases, disease is accidental, or even detrimental, to the microbe's long-term survival. Viruses that cause disease in man are obligate parasites, although they often cause inapparent, subclinical or asymptomatic infection. Many viruses rely on infecting a particular host species. Smallpox was eradicated, not only because of the availability of an effective vaccine, but also because man was the only host. Some bacteria, fungi, protozoa and helminths are also species-specific. Among bacteria, the agent of tuberculosis, which is harboured by one-third of humanity, has an absolute requirement to cause disease for its natural transmission to continue.",

All infection recently transmitted has an immediate source and reaches the newly infected individual via one or more specific mode(s) of transmission. Behind these events, the organism, which of course does not care how we choose to classify it or its activities, lives and propagates in its natural habitat(s). These may or may not be the same as the immediate source but, in considering the control of infection, the natural habitat of the causal organism constitutes the reservoir of infection. These points are illustrated in Figure 1.2\n. Elimination of the organism from the reservoir will lead to eradication of the infection, whereas elimination from the immediate source, if this is distinct from the reservoir, provides one means by which control of infection can be achieved.",
