Defining the optimal approach for managing a critically ill COVID-19 patient is rapidly changing. Goal-directed transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is frequently used by physicians caring for intubated critically-ill patients as a reliable imaging modality that is wellsuited to answer questions at bedside. A multi-disciplinary group of experts in point-of-care echocardiography and TEE representing intensive care, critical care cardiology and emergency medicine from the United States and Canada, convened to review the available evidence, share experiences, and produce a consensus statement aimed to provide clinicians with a framework to maximize the safety of patients and healthcare providers when considering TEE in critically ill patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. While transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can provide the information needed in most patients, there are specific scenarios in which TEE represents the modality of choice. Among other critical care applications, TEE can allow hemodynamic assessment of patients during prone ventilation, perform serial evaluations of the lungs during recruitment maneuvers, guide cardiac arrest resuscitation, and facilitate veno-venous extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) cannulation. To aid other clinicians in performing TEE during the COVID-19 pandemic,",

Point-of-care cardiopulmonary ultrasound is a fundamental tool in the evaluation of shock and respiratory failure 10, 11 , and has been proposed as an ideal diagnostic modality for COVID-19 patients 12 . While in most patients, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can provide the information needed, there are situations in which goal-directed transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) provides superior diagnostic value. In contrast with comprehensive echocardiography, TEE provides acute care clinicians with a goal-directed framework to guide clinical care at the point-of-care in various clinical scenarios. Common applications of TEE in critically-ill patients include assessment of circulatory failure, hemodynamic monitoring, evaluation of unexplained hypoxemia, and cardiac arrest [13] [14] [15] . Early data has suggested that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with multiple cardiovascular complications, including myocardial dysfunction as well as the presence of a hypercoagulable state leading to an increased risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) such as pulmonary embolism (PE) [16] [17] [18] .",

In our experience and as extensively described in the literature, echocardiographic assistance is commonly used in a number of emergency procedures, such as initiation and monitoring of ECMO 37 , assistance in placement of pulmonary artery catheters 38 Following cannulation and during support with ECMO, TEE may be required to exclude complications related to VV ECMO, as TTE is more limited in its spatial resolution. Such complications include cannula thrombosis, chamber compression from tamponade, or cannula displacement 37, 45, 46 . During this period TEE can also be used to troubleshoot the development of hypoxemia, including the identification of recirculation, when the tips of the cannulae are located too close together, inadequate ECMO flows due to hypovolemia, and thrombus formation within the cannula 37 .",

In particular, the use of TEE to image the lungs, so called transesophageal lung ultrasound or \"TELUS\", has been increasingly used in the ICU environment after being initially described in the operative environment 49 . This application is rarely if ever indicated on its own in the critical care environment, but rather as an extension of the TEE examination providing a complete cardiopulmonary assessment hence increasing the value of this modality. One of the benefits of imaging the lungs from within the esophagus, a relatively posterior location compared to transthoracic lung ultrasound technique, is its effectiveness at visualizing the more dependent regions of the lung. These regions are typically very difficult to visualize in the supine critically ill patient using a surface approach, yet if densely occupied with alveolar disease or atelectasis (manifest as consolidation pattern), may contribute to life threatening respiratory failure.",

While it should be noted that the artifacts that form the basis of lung ultrasonography have not been validated in TEE but rather extrapolated from transthoracic ultrasound 49 , the use TELUS in some of these selected cases has allowed us to have immediate and real-time feedback on recruitability of the lung.

            "text": "Prone positioning ventilation is known to improve ventilation-perfusion matching and dorsal alveolar recruitment, and has been associated with improved survival in some patients with ARDS 51 . Recent international guidelines for the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 have recommended the use of prone ventilation for 12 to 16 hours in mechanically ventilated adults with moderate to severe ARDS 52 . A distinguishing advantage of TEE is that it is well suited to be performed in patients during prone ventilation 53, 54 . We have performed TEE on prone patients on several occasions. The indication is usually that the patient is too hypoxemic and unstable to unprone. There is usually an urgent need for TEE to evaluate left ventricular function, for instance when titrating up PEEP, or when there is concern about the size and function of the RV to tolerate recruitment maneuvers when there is evidence of atelectasis. This is also the case as part of the evaluation for ECMO in patients who remain hypoxemic in prone ventilation, and the decision for VV or VA is being considered. The logistical concern is obvious, but the real issue is only with the actual insertion of the probe into the esophagus; once that is achieved, the rest of the exam is the same as the usual TEE exam. To successfully accomplish TEE probe insertion on a prone patient, we have found helpful turning the patient partially on their side and introducing the probe while maintaining alignment of the head and chest. The patient is then returned to the prone position, with the exception of the head and neck which will remain facing the examiner while the probe is in place. In our group's experience, it is fairly easy to perform TEE in these patients with the proper technique, as they can remain prone throughout the course of the exam. We have found that the TEE exam in prone patients has been particularly helpful during the COVID pandemic, given the degree of hypoxemia seen in these patients and the many urgent ECMO evaluations we've had to perform. With that said, it should be noted that TEE will always be easier in supine position and should therefore be only performed in prone position when the information required is needed urgently enough as in the situations described above, that the examination cannot wait until the patient is back to supine position. Figure 3 shows two of the authors performing a point-of-care TEE examination during hemodynamic decompensation of a patient in prone ventilation.",

These practical recommendations are summarized in Table 1 . We recommend that the use of TEE in this setting is planned at the system-level rather than the provider or department level, with a multidisciplinary approach that involves not only those performing the studies at the bedside, but also those involved in all related tasks necessary for the examinations to be performed (e.g. central processing department, transport, technicians, etc.). Similar to other high-risk procedures performed routinely (e.g. endotracheal intubation), we also recommend that clinical teams have pre-established protocols in place and consider the use of in-situ simulation to familiarize pertinent staff with the steps needed to maximize safety during this procedure. Additionally, in order to minimize risk during the procedure, the length should be limited to the minimum required to acquire the images needed in the goal-directed examination. During the exam images and loops should be recorded and stored for further review after the examination is completed.",

            "text": "adequate TTE images are often limited. COVID-19 patients in the ICU are frequently deeply sedated and paralyzed as part of their ventilation needs. Consequently, the anesthetic considerations with regard to both the consumption of medications in the pandemic as well as the risk of these medications, is obviated during the decision-making process to perform TEE.With respect to the cardiac particularities of COVID-19, an acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome (ACovCS) has been reported in some hospitalized patients. TheACovCS can manifest with a variety of clinical presentations that include an acute cardiac injury with cardiomyopathy, ventricular arrhythmias and hemodynamic instability in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease35 . Despite the great amount of literature speculating on cardiac features of this disease, our experience working in the frontline acute care settings caring for patients with shock and COVID-19 most commonly unveils echo findings we typically see in other infectious causes of respiratory failure. Namely these patients are frequently hyperdynamic and have elevated cardiac output. As well as in pre-COVID era ARDS descriptions36 , right ventricular dilation is seen commonly, especially in those who have been ventilated for at least 1",

Recent international guidelines recommend consideration of ECMO in patients with severe respiratory failure from SARS-CoV-2 when conventional management fails, if resources and expertise are available 43 . As of 25 April 2020, 563 confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases have undergone initiation of ECMO and are reported in the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry 44 . Goal-directed TEE plays an important role in the management of these critically ill patients 37 . Prior to initiating VV -ECMO support in patients with refractory hypoxemia, an echocardiographic assessment should be performed. Echocardiography may identify unexpected and reversible findings (e.g., cardiac tamponade, PE) or demonstrate severe left ventricular dysfunction, which should prompt consideration of veno-arterial (VA) ECMO. Severe valvular pathology affecting the success of VV or VA ECMO should also be excluded (e.g. severe aortic insufficiency, mitral regurgitation or tricuspid stenosis). Although not relevant for cannulation and ECMO management, detection of patent foramen ovale (PFO) may affect weaning consideration. Vascular assessment is essential to exclude pre-existent complications, such as thrombosis, stenosis, or dissection, and for appropriate selection of type and size of cannulas 37,45 . Normal variants or embryological remnants of right heart structures might also affect the appropriate and safe placement of venous cannulas. For example, a prominent Chiari network may impede proper cannula positioning and increase the thrombotic risk. A dilated coronary sinus, as observed in persistent left superior vena cava, may be accidentally cannulated and compromise oxygenation. Presence of pacemaker or defibrillator leads should also be documented 45 . During the cannulation process, TEE allows for the evaluation of proper guidewire and cannula positioning at the bedside in the ICU. TEE guidance confirms the course of the guidewire to exclude coiling in the right atrium, displacement across the tricuspid valve, crossing the interatrial septum, or entering the carotid sinus 45-47 . TEE guidance can ensure the return cannula is positioned clear of the tricuspid valve or interatrial septum, ensuring the access and return cannulas are placed with sufficient distance between them to decrease the risk for recirculation. A dual-lumen bicaval cannula may be used and is placed in the right internal jugular traversing from the superior vena cava (SVC) to inferior vena cava along the posterior aspect of the RA 46-48 .",
