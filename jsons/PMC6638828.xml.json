            "text": "Geminiviruses (family Geminiviridae) are among the most devastating plant pathogens worldwide and, together with potyviruses (family Potyviridae), constitute the two largest and most important plant virus families (Gibbs and Ohshima, 2010; Scholthof et al., 2011). By causing heavy losses on food and cash crops, such as cassava, tomatoes, grain legumes, vegetables, maize and cotton, geminiviruses represent a new threat to global food security and sustainability. During the last two decades, epidemics of re\u2010emerging and newly emerging geminiviruses have caused huge crop losses and threatened crop production, particularly in the tropics and subtropics. Because of their agricultural importance, geminiviruses have been characterized extensively at the molecular level.",

            "text": "Geminivirus genomes consist of one (monopartite) or two (bipartite) circular single\u2010stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules, which are packaged in icosahedral twinned particles (B\u00f6ttcher et al., 2004; Krupovic et al., 2009; Zhang W. et al., 2001). These viruses are divided into four genera\u2014Begomovirus, Curtovirus, Topocuvirus and Mastrevirus\u2014based on genome organization, nucleotide sequence similarities and biological properties (Brown et al., 2012). Begomoviruses (type species Bean golden mosaic virus, BGMV) have either monopartite or bipartite genomes and are transmitted by whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci) (Brown, 1994). The two genomic components of bipartite begomoviruses are designated DNA\u2010A and DNA\u2010B (Fig. 1a). DNA\u2010A has six open reading frames (ORFs), two in the virion sense (AV1 and AV2) and four in the complementary sense (AC1, AC2 and AC3 and AC4). DNA\u2010B has two ORFs, the virion\u2010sense BV1 and complementary\u2010sense BC1. The AV2 ORF is found in Old World bipartite begomoviruses, but not in New World viruses. Except for an approximately 200\u2010nucleotide segment of the 5\u2032 intergenic region (IR), designated the common region (CR), the two genomic components of bipartite begomoviruses are different in sequence. The CR contains an origin of replication organized modularly, including a stem\u2010loop structure containing the invariant nonanucleotide TAATATTAC sequence, which is required for the cleavage and joining of the viral DNA during replication (Laufs et al., 1995). The ORFs of monopartite begomoviruses include the virion\u2010sense V1 and V2 genes and the complementary\u2010sense C1, C2, C3 and C4 genes (Fig. 1b).",

Except for a recent identification of mastreviruses in sweet potato in Peru (Kreuze et al., 2009) and in dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) in Puerto Rico (Rosario et al., 2013), these viruses have been found only in the Old World, where they infect a range of monocotyledonous plants (reviewed in Brown et al., 2012) and, from recent reports, dicotyledonous plants (Hadfield et al., 2012; Liu et al., 1999; Nahid et al., 2008). Mastreviruses have four ORFs, V1 and V2 on the virion\u2010sense strand, and C1 and C2 on the complementary\u2010sense strand, separated by two IRs on opposite sides of the genome, designated as large (LIR) and small (SIR) (Kammann et al., 1991) (Fig. 1c). The SIR contains termination and polyadenylation sequences for both the complementary\u2010sense and virion\u2010sense transcripts, and is probably the origin of replication of the complementary\u2010sense strand (Hayes et al., 1988). For mastreviruses, but not for viruses of other genera, an approximately 80\u2010nucleotide primer is present in the virion and specifically anneals to the SIR (Kammann et al., 1991; Shen and Hohn, 1991).",

In the mastreviruses, the full\u2010length Rep is translated from a spliced transcript of the C1 and C2 ORFs. The multifunctional nature of begomovirus Reps and the functional domains have been characterized (Heyraud\u2010Nitschke et al., 1995; Orozco et al., 1997) (Fig. 2). Rep is essential for rolling circle replication (RCR) and is involved in the modulation of gene expression (Elmer et al., 1988; Etessami et al., 1991; Haley et al., 1992; Hong and Stanley, 1995; Saunders et al., 1991), analogous to some animal and bacterial ssDNA viruses (Stenger et al., 1991) and plasmids (Oshima et al., 2001), suggesting a strong evolutionary link between these proteins (Ilyina and Koonin, 1992).",

            "text": "The first step in geminivirus replication is the synthesis of the complementary strand from the genomic ssDNA using a still\u2010unknown mechanism that is thought to be catalysed entirely by host factors. Rep, an early gene, confers virus\u2010specific recognition of its cognate origin of replication (Fontes et al., 1994) and initiates DNA replication (Laufs et al., 1995; Lazarowitz et al., 1992; Orozco et al., 1997). The recognition mechanism appears to differ between mastreviruses and begomoviruses, based on the architecture of the origin of replication (Gutierrez et al., 2004). For mastreviruses, the origin consists of a large cis\u2010acting region containing several Rep binding sites (Castellano et al., 1999; Sanz\u2010Burgos and Guti\u00e9rrez, 1998), whereas the begomovirus origin contains a single Rep binding site (Fontes et al., 1992, 1994; Lazarowitz et al., 1992; Orozco and Hanley\u2010Bowdoin, 1998). In either case, however, the Rep oligomerizes into a complex as illustrated for MSV (Horvath et al., 1998), Wheat dwarf virus (WDV) (Castellano et al., 1999; Sanz\u2010Burgos and Guti\u00e9rrez, 1998) and Tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV) (Orozco and Hanley\u2010Bowdoin, 1998) from mutational analyses of the oligomerization domain. In planta Rep oligomerization has been elucidated recently using Abutilon mosaic virus (AbMV) Rep bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay in Nicotiana benthamiana plants, where Rep oligomers accumulated in the nucleoplasm and replicated AbMV DNA\u2010B (Krenz et al., 2011).",

            "text": "To initiate the RCR, the begomovirus Rep binds to the Rep complex binding site, which contains a directly repeated sequence between the TATA box and the transcription start site (Fontes et al., 1992). For the mastreviruses, the complex binds presumably to three sites located in the proximity of the two divergent TATA boxes upstream and downstream of the DNA replication initiation site and at the base of the conserved stem\u2010loop (Castellano et al., 1999; Laufs et al., 1995). On binding, a process which involves motif I (Fig. 2a), the Rep complex cleaves the phosphodiester bond between the last T and A in the invariant loop sequence in a biochemical process mediated by motif II, which is a metal binding site that may be involved in protein conformation (Arguello\u2010Astorga et al., 2004; Laufs et al., 1995; Orozco and Hanley\u2010Bowdoin, 1998). A third sequence, motif III, is the catalytic site that is required for DNA cleavage and ligation (Orozco et al., 1997), thus providing the necessary 3\u2032\u2010OH for priming nascent viral DNA synthesis by host DNA polymerases. Recently, Nash et al. (2011) have identified a conserved motif, named the geminivirus Rep sequence (GRS) (Fig. 2a), and have shown that it is required for the initiation of virus replication. An artificial zinc\u2010finger protein designed to bind to the Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) Rep binding site with high affinity has been shown recently to inhibit Rep binding and TYLCV replication (Mori et al., 2012).",

RBR represses cell cycle progression through its interactions with E2F (Arguello\u2010Astorga et al., 2004). Accordingly, interaction between Rep and RBR interferes with the interaction between RBR and E2F and frees the activator class of E2F to activate the expression of genes required for DNA replication, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Arguello\u2010Astorga et al., 2004; Egelkrout et al., 2001; Kong et al., 2000), which is permissive for viral DNA replication.",

Interaction between Rep and RFC is said to recruit RFC into the replication complex, where it facilitates the assembly of other replication factors (Luque et al., 2002). Rep also binds PCNA, which starts to accumulate in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, reaching the highest level during the S phase and decreasing during the G2 and M phases (Gutierrez, 2000). Furthermore, TGMV Rep has been shown recently to interact with small ubiquitin\u2010related modifier (SUMO)\u2010conjugating enzyme (SCE1) to presumably modulate the SUMOylation level of host targets, thereby creating a suitable environment for virus replication (Castillo et al., 2004; S\u00e1nchez\u2010Dur\u00e1n et al., 2011). Although SUMOylation plays an important role in human DNA virus infection by altering the molecular interactions of the modified substrate, changing the localization, stability and/or activity (reviewed in Wimmer et al., 2012), definitive conclusions on the role of SUMO modification during plant virus infection are yet to be determined.",

It is important to indicate that RPA is critical to other viral replication initiator proteins, including SV40 large T antigen (Weisshart et al., 1998), EBNA1 proteins of Epstein\u2013Barr virus (Zhang et al., 1998), E1 proteins of papilloma virus (Loo and Melendy, 2004) and NS1 proteins of parvovirus (Christensen and Tattersall, 2002).

However, still to be fully determined are the mechanism of cellular factor recruitment and the biochemical events leading to Rep binding to viral DNA to initiate genome replication. In addition, it is not yet known whether a ssDNA binding protein coats and stabilizes the geminivirus genomic ssDNA prior to replicative form synthesis, as has long been known for ssDNA phages that replicate via the RCR mechanism (Arai and Kornberg, 1979; Geider et al., 1978).",

The RepA mRNA accounts for most of the complementary\u2010sense transcripts in monocot\u2010infecting mastreviruses, including MSV, WDV and Digitaria streak virus (DSV) (Dekker et al., 1991; Mullineaux et al., 1990; Wright et al., 1997), as well as in the dicot\u2010infecting mastreviruses (Gutierrez, 2000; Hefferon et al., 2006; Munoz\u2010Martin et al., 2003). RepA and Rep have identical primary sequences in their approximately 200 N\u2010terminal amino acid residues (Fig. 2b). Like Rep, RepA is multifunctional and, in several cases, performs the functions of bipartite geminivirus Reps, including the transactivation of virus\u2010sense ORFs, as has been elucidated for MSV, WDV and Bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV) (Hefferon et al., 2006; Munoz\u2010Martin et al., 2003). RepA also represses its own expression and the expression of Rep, as elucidated in BeYDV (Hefferon et al., 2006), by binding to a site in the LIR. RepA interaction with RBR has been mapped to the LXCXE motif in the mastreviruses MSV, BeYDV and WDV (Horvath et al., 1998; Liu et al., 1999; Xie et al., 1995). However, the LXCXE motif is absent in some mastrevirus RepAs, including Sugarcane streak virus (SSV), Miscanthus streak virus (MiSV) (Hughes et al., 1993) and BeYDV (Hefferon et al., 2006), suggesting that it is not an absolute requirement for mastreviruses. Furthermore, LXCXE is absent in begomovirus Reps, which bind to RBR through a novel, conserved \u03b1\u2010helical region (Arguello\u2010Astorga et al., 2004; Hanley\u2010Bowdoin et al., 2004; Kong et al., 2000).

GRAB proteins, which are involved in plant development and senescence, impair geminivirus replication, suggesting that they modulate the viral replication cycle (Lozano\u2010Duran et al., 2011; Xie et al., 1999).",

TrAP is a positional analogue of C2 (or L2) protein in curtoviruses and topocuviruses. AC2, together with AC3, is expressed from a dicistronic transcript driven by a strong monodirectional promoter located within the AC1 coding sequence (Shivaprasad et al., 2005). TrAP, which has been well characterized in begomoviruses, is a multifunctional protein. It is involved in gene activation (Haley et al., 1992; Shivaprasad et al., 2005; Sunter and Bisaro, 1992), virus pathogenicity (Hong et al., 1996) and suppression of gene silencing (Chowda\u2010Reddy et al., 2009; Trinks et al., 2005; Vanitharani et al., 2005; Voinnet et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2005). TrAP activates the transcription of the genes coding for coat protein (CP) and movement protein (MP) in a non\u2010virus\u2010specific manner (Hanley\u2010Bowdoin et al., 1999; Saunders and Stanley, 1995; Sunter et al., 1994), and transactivation is dependent on its zinc\u2010finger and C\u2010terminal acidic domains (Fig. 3) (Hartitz et al., 1999), as well as on its ability to form multimers (Yang et al., 2007). TrAP regulates the tissue\u2010specific expression of the CP promoter by overriding a putative host repressor in phloem tissues (Sunter and Bisaro, 1997).",

The Arabidopsis transcription factor, PEAPOD2, specifically binds to activating sequences in the CP promoter of TGMV and Cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCV) in mesophyll tissues, but not to sequences required for TrAP\u2010mediated derepression in phloem tissues (Lacatus and Sunter, 2009). TrAP does not specifically bind to double\u2010stranded DNA (dsDNA) and, instead, is thought to be directed to responsive promoters through interactions with cellular proteins (Hartitz et al., 1999; Lacatus and Sunter, 2009). Thus, TrAP is similar to the Adenovirus E1A protein, a transactivational regulatory factor, which does not bind DNA, but is necessary for transcriptional activation (Avvakumov et al., 2002; Zu et al., 1992). Conclusive evidence of transcriptional activation activity by a monopartite begomovirus C2 protein was reported for Tomato leaf curl virus (ToLCV) (Dry et al., 2000), and it is likely that other monopartite begomovirus C2 proteins are also transcriptional activators. In contrast, the curtovirus C2 does not activate transcription (Hormuzdi and Bisaro, 1995). A possible mechanism of TrAP nuclear import for transcriptional activation is provided by the reported interaction between C2 of the begomovirus Bhendi yellow vein mosaic virus and karyopherin \u03b1 (Chandran et al., 2012), a soluble receptor, which probably transports C2 through nuclear pore complexes into the nucleoplasm.",

Disruption of the C4 ORF of ToLCV (Rigden et al., 1994), TYLCV (Jupin et al., 1994) and BSCTV (Teng et al., 2010) caused a reduction in viral DNA levels and symptom development, suggesting its involvement in symptom development and virus movement.

Expression of the BCTV and BSCTV C4 proteins in transgenic Arabidopsis results in phenotypes that mimic the symptoms seen during viral infection (Mills\u2010Lujan and Deom, 2010). Similarly, the expression of BCTV C4 in transgenic N. benthamiana results in ectopic cell division (Latham et al., 1997; Piroux et al., 2007), implying that the vein swelling associated with BCTV C4 is caused by abnormal cell division. Consistent with this finding, Lai et al. (2009) reported that BSCTV C4 induced the expression of RKP, which may be involved in cell cycle regulation. According to a study by Park et al.

It is encoded by the AV1 (also AR1) ORF in bipartite geminiviruses and by the V1 ORF in monopartite geminiviruses (Zhang W. et al., 2001). In addition to virus genome packaging, the CP has been associated with several other functions, including insect transmission (Boulton et al., 1993; Briddon et al., 1990; Mullineaux et al., 1984), shuttling of viral DNA into and out of the nucleus in monopartite geminiviruses (Liu et al., 1999), and cell\u2010to\u2010cell and systemic spread of virus (Boulton et al., 1989; Liu et al., 1997; Pitaksutheepong, 1999). The CP binds ss\u2010 and dsDNA (Liu et al., 1997) and may participate indirectly in viral DNA replication during RCR by binding and sequestering ssDNA from the replication cycle (Saunders et al., 1991; Stenger et al., 1991). Although all begomovirus CPs contain sequences that are highly conserved, they also contain regions that are variable and can be used to correlate phylogenetic inferences with biotic and geographic characteristics (Padidam et al., 1995). Evidence that the CP plays a critical role in insect virus transmission was elucidated using the whitefly\u2010transmitted ACMV and the leafhopper\u2010transmitted BCTV. An ACMV chimeric virus containing the BCTV CP gene is transmitted by leafhoppers, which, in nature, transmit BCTV but not ACMV (Briddon et al., 1990). Sequences important for insect transmission have been mapped to the central part of CP (Hohnle et al., 2001; Kheyr\u2010Pour et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2001; Noris et al., 1998; Unseld et al., 2001) and may play a role in CP multimerization, which is necessary for virus capsid assembly and insect transmission (Hallan and Gafni, 2001; Noris et al., 1998; Zhang W. et al., 2001).",

This is consistent with the fact that the CP of Squash leaf curl virus (SqLCV), a bipartite begomovirus, can functionally replace NSP (encoded by BV1) (Ingham et al., 1995; Qin et al., 1998). Nuclear import and export appear to be dependent on ssDNA binding to the N\u2010terminal domain of the CP (Pitaksutheepong et al., 2007). The CP nuclear localization signal (NLS) has been localized to the N\u2010 and C\u2010termini and the central region of the protein (Unseld et al., 2001) (Fig. 5). The bipartite begomovirus MYMV CP interacts with importin \u03b1, a component of the nuclear pore\u2010targeting complex (Guerra\u2010Peraza et al., 2005), and the N\u2010terminal NLS of TYLCV CP binds to karyopherin \u03b11 (Kunik et al., 1999) for nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. The N\u2010terminal NLS also binds to the GroEL protein of Arsenophonus, a bacterial endosymbiont found in the midgut of Bemisia tabaci, presumably to protect the virions in the insect vector haemolymph (Kunik et al., 1999; Morin et al., 2000; Rana et al., 2012; Yaakov et al., 2011). A leucine\u2010rich nuclear export signal (NES) that mediates trafficking from the nucleus to the cytoplasm was mapped to the CP central region (Ward and Lazarowitz, 1999). It is important to note that bipartite begomoviruses with mutated or replaced CP are infectious, albeit with delayed and attenuated symptoms (Brough et al., 1988; Pooma et al., 1996; Sudarshana et al., 1998), suggesting that other host proteins functionally replace the CP and import the genome to the nucleus on initial viral infection and prior to the synthesis of NSP.",

To achieve cell\u2010to\u2010cell and long\u2010distance movement, the NSP\u2013viral DNA complex is trapped by the MP in the cytoplasm and redirected to and across the cell wall into adjacent cells, where NSP directs the viral genome to the nucleus for new cycles of replication (Lazarowitz and Beachy, 1999; Noueiry et al., 1994; Sanderfoot and Lazarowitz, 1995; Sanderfoot et al., 1996; Ward et al., 1997). It is important to note that NSP is consistently being shown not to be required for virus infectivity, presumably because the CP exhibits nuclear import and export functions as discussed above. This has led to the suggestion that both proteins have a common evolutionary origin and share redundant functions (Zhou et al., 2007), including the nucleocytoplasmic transport of viral DNA (Liu et al., 1997; Rigden et al., 1993; Saeed et al., 2007). Accordingly, both proteins localize in the nucleus, preferentially to the nucleolus (Fig. 6) (Rojas et al., 2001; Sharma and Ikegami, 2009; Zhou et al., 2011).",

This interaction presumably results in the acetylation of NSP and the segregation of ssDNA for movement and encapsidation. Several geminivirus NSPs are also known to interact with a cytoplasmic GTPase to export the viral DNA\u2013NSP complex from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is redirected to the cell surface to interact with the viral MP (Carvalho et al., 2008a). Evidence from SqLCV NSP shows that the nuclear export of nascent viral DNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is mediated by a leucine\u2010rich NES.",

Thus, BDMV NSP has been reported to induce an HR in Phaseolus vulgaris (Garrido\u2010Ramirez et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2007), as does ToLCNDV NSP in N. tabacum and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) (Hussain et al., 2005, 2007). The involvement of NSP in virus pathogenicity is supported by its interactions with membrane receptor kinases, including NSP\u2010interacting kinase (NIK), belonging to the receptor\u2010like group of kinases implicated in a wide range of signal transduction pathways (Fontes et al., 2004; Rocha et al., 2008; Sakamoto et al., 2012; Santos et al., 2009). NSP also interacts with proline\u2010rich extensin\u2010like receptor protein kinase (PERK), probably to phosphorylate and regulate NSP function (Florentino et al., 2006; Fontes et al., 2004). Furthermore, a recent study has shown that a host nucleoprotein, histone H3, interacts with BDMV NSP and MP, forming a complex of histone H3, NSP, MP and viral DNA (Zhou et al., 2011), to presumably facilitate the export of nascent viral DNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for cell\u2010to\u2010cell and long\u2010distance movement.",

Although the monopartite geminivirus CP is required for viral movement (Boulton et al., 1989), V1 and V2 share no significant sequence identity with BC1 or BV1 (Rojas et al., 2001). Furthermore, there are functional differences between monopartite begomovirus MPs and MPs of mastreviruses. For instance, similar to bipartite begomovirus MPs, monopartite begomovirus MPs bind viral DNA, whereas mastrevirus MPs do not. Furthermore, cell\u2010to\u2010cell movement in monopartite begomoviruses is mediated by C4 (Krichevsky et al., 2006; Rojas et al., 1998, 2001); CP, MP and C4 are involved in the delivery of TYLCV DNA, as virions or as nucleoprotein complexes, to the plant cell periphery (Rojas et al., 2001). To move the complex from the cell periphery for cell\u2010to\u2010cell transport, MP interacts with plasmodesmata (Rojas et al., 2001) and, because mastrevirus MPs do not bind viral DNA, virus movement is effected through interaction with the CP (Kotlitzky et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2001). Monopartite geminivirus MPs presumably enhance CP\u2010mediated nuclear export of viral DNA and a NES was mapped to the N\u2010terminus of ToLCJV V2 (Sharma and Ikegami, 2010). A model has been proposed, whereby MP diverts the CP\u2013DNA complex from the nucleus to the cell periphery, where it mediates movement through the PD (Liu et al., 2001).",

Conversely, in virus\u2010infected pumpkin sink leaves, MPs of SqLCV (a phloem\u2010limited virus) and CaLCV (which infects all cell types) predominantly associate with ER\u2010derived tubules that penetrate the cell wall and are found only in undifferentiated vascular tissues (procambium) and in lesser amounts within the plasma membrane (Ward et al., 1997).

These endosomes are thought to traffic the complex via a recapture pathway to dock at the PD for intercellular transport. A similar interaction occurs between SYTA and the MP of Tobacco mosaic virus, an RNA virus, suggesting a convergent evolutionary lineage between these MPs, as there is no evidence that they share a common ancestry. Synaptotagmins are calcium sensors, and their ability to regulate synaptic vesicle exo\u2010/endocytosis has long been characterized in animals (Fukuda, 2003) and, more recently, in plants (Chapman, 2008). Recently, AbMV MP has been reported to form a complex with the heat shock cognate 70\u2010kDa protein to facilitate viral movement along cellular plastids and stromules into a neighbouring cell (Krenz et al., 2010, 2012).
