            "text": "MnZn ferrites have spinel structure [121] . The spinel structure has one major unit cell composed of 8 sub-unit cells having face centered cubic (FCC) structure with two types of sites in each unit cell i.e. tetrahedral (A) site and octahedral (B) site in the complete structure of MnZn ferrite. There are 64 tetrahedral interstitial sites and 32 octahedral interstitial sites. Spinel structure has closed packed oxygen atoms arrangement in which 32 oxygen atoms form a unit cell. Tetrahedral (A) sites are surrounded by four nearest neighbor oxygen atoms and octahedral (B) sites have six nearest oxygen atoms around it as shown in figure 4 . In MnZn spinel lattice, Zn ions are on the tetrahedral sites while Fe and Mn ions occupy both tetrahedral and octahedral sites. Due to this spinel structure, different metallic ions can be introduced that cause change in the electric and magnetic properties of ferrites. The metal ions introduced may enter the spinel crystal lattice by replacing Fe 3+ ions and leading to aggregation of these ions on the grain boundary. These morphological features suggest that the properties of MnZn ferrite nanoparticles can be tuned as long as the nanoparticle designer is specifically for a given application choose appropriate synthesis and characterization techniques for MnZn ferrites. In order to know the best advantages of MnZn ferrites for various applications, one has to be aware of different synthesis and characterization techniques.",

            "text": "There are two approaches to synthesize nanoparticles: top-down and bottom-up. Both these approaches are shown in figure 5 . In top-down, a bulk material is broken down to get nanosized particles. This method has many limitations like generally metal oxides are used, requirement of very high temperature for the reaction, products are inhomogeneous, presence of impurities, crystal defects, broad size distribution and imperfection in surface structure. In bottom-up approach, small atomic building blocks fit together to produce nanoparticles. This is most favorable method for nanoparticles synthesis as the products in this method are homogeneous, highly pure and have narrow size distribution. Various synthesis techniques are used to prepare MnZn ferrite nanoparticles [152] [153] [154] [155] [156] [157] [158] [159] [160] such as sol-gel mthod [161] [162] [163] [164] , polyol process [165] ,co-precipitation method [104, 166, 167] , hydrothermal method [113] , citrate precursor method [122] , solid state reaction method [118] , auto-combustion method, ceramic processing method [139] . The techniques to synthesize MnZn ferrites are shown in figure 6 . By doping other elements or oxides [168] [169] [170] [171] the structural, electrical and magnetic properties of MnZn ferrite can be enhanced. For instance, Zaspalis et al. [172] observed that there was 17% improvement in the total power loss per volume when doping was done of Nb 2 O 5 in pure MnZn ferrite. After doping there was reduction in the losses related to magnetostriction and stress related hysteresis losses. Also, the eddy current losses related to electrical resistivity were also reduced. Xiang et al. [173] prepared MnZn ferrite particles with Ce 3+ doping and observed that no impurity phase was detected in the XRD pattern. It confirmed that Ce ions entirely got dissolved in spinel structure. This also led an increase in the saturation magnetization and decrease in the coercivity of MnZn ferrites, leading to an overall improvement in the soft magnetic properties of the material. Some methods of synthesis are described below.",

It can be defined as an electromagnetic wave having frequency and wavelength between 300 MHz and 300GHz in 1m to 1mm range respectively. While the study of microwaves started during 1930s, the first work on microwave hydrothermal synthesis of nanoparticles was demonstrated by Dr. Komarneni et al. while distinguishing the traditional hydrothermal synthesis methods [174] from microwave hydrothermal synthesis [175] [176] [177] . In microwave hydrothermal method, heat required in synthesis process is generated by microwaves which have the advantage of high penetrating power. Microwaves can penetrate and heat the sample to a certain depth. Microwave hydrothermal method is beneficial as it has very fast heating rates to allow generation of uniform nanomaterials with fine particle size distribution. Hence, this is faster cleaner and economical method as compared to traditional hydrothermal method [178] . Praveena were dissolved in 50ml de-ionized water. In this process pH was maintained at about 9.4.Thereafter the mixture was sealed in tetrafluorometoxil (TFM) and was put in microwave oven for 30min at 160\u2103 followed by washing of the solids with de-ionized water and ethanol several times. The resulting wet mixture was dried and then polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was added that acts as a binder. The powder was then pressed into pellets followed by sintering at 900\u2103 for 30 min.Single phase spinel structure was confirmed by the XRD spectra.",

After that the products were washed many times with hot de-ionized water and acetone and finally dried in an oven at 80\u2103 for 5h.By this method, large quantity of ferrite nanoparticles can be synthesized.

In this method, manganese chloride, zinc chloride, iron(III) chloride and sodium hydroxide were used as raw materials. A 3M solution was prepared in 60ml of distilled water. This solution was then poured into boiling NaOH solution while stirring for 60min at temperature 353-358K with a magnetic stirrer, maintaining the pH between 11 and 12. Stirring allowed precipitates of the nanoparticles to settled down and then sample was washed many times with distilled water. After washing, the sample was dried in hot air oven followed by crushing the resultant into powder using mortar pestle. Anwar et al. [9] . These all starting materials were mixed by rapidly adding Diammonium oxalate under continuous stirring at 45 0 C for 30 min until precipitates were formed. Precipitates were washed many times and then dried in an oven at 100 0 C for 8h. Dried yellow precipitates were used to prepare ferrites by using in-house built microwave heating set up. Aluminium metal powder was used as microwave susceptor. This set up was then put on a commercial microwave oven operated at a frequency 2.45GHz. The oven was set to raise the temperature to 450 0 C. Then, brick was taken out and allowed to cool.Co-precipitation method has several advantages as it uses aqueous medium for synthesis and also the synthesis is very simple. There is a good control on the size and morphology of the nano particles formed. But this method takes long time to synthesize nanoferrites. This method is disadvantageous due to poor crystalline nature of the resultant ferrite powder.",

This method is advantageous because of controlled microstructure of the final product. The resultant particles formed are of uniform and small size. Also, this technique of nanoparticles synthesis is economical and it involves use of low temperature. Duan et al.

These materials were dissolved in de-ionized water at 60\u2103.

There was a decrease in dielectric constant and dielectric loss tangent with increase in nickel concentration.This method is advantageous because of better size and shape control but it takes a longer time to complete the synthesis.Sol-gel method is a simple process, require low processing temperature and low cost.

Then, it ignited within 5 s with flame temperature ~1600\u2103.Combustion technique methodology is described in figure 5 . With doping other elements decrease in the lattice parameter was observed which could be attributed to the fact that ions of doped elements get trapped at the grain boundaries. Hence they hinder the grain growth and may cause increase in strain on the grains and lead to lattice parameter to decrease.Doping of rare-earth metals can be done using combustion method [189] in a single step. The fuel chosen in the combustion methodalso has very important effect on the MnZn ferrites prepared. The fuels that are generally preferred in this method are urea and glycine.

The resultant products in this technique showed high saturation magnetization and high values of Curie temperature that was between 750K and 380K.",

Proper amounts of MnCO 3 , Zn(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 Oand Fe(NO 3 ) 2 .9H 2 O were powdered and mixed with Stearic acid in molten form. Stirring was done for 3-4h after heating the mixture in oil bath at 120\u2103. This resulted in formation of a brown gel. The gel was cooled in air and then powdered by grinding it. This was followed by washing of the grinded mixture with water three times followed by drying of this mixture at 100\u2103.MnZn ferrites were obtained by heating at 450\u2103 for 1 h.",

The size of the sample that was not UV treated was found to reduce from 90nm to 50nmandthe crystallite size of the pure MnZn ferrites was found to be in the range 25nm to 35nm in almost all cases as described in the table 3. The lattice parameter was found to be in the range 8.30\u00c5 to 8.570 \u00c5. Praveena et al.

Mirshekari et al. [204] observed from the XRD that the average crystallite size was in the range 43.25nm-66.7nm. Small amount of lattice strains were also observed improving its magnetic properties. Anwar et al. [9] studied the effect of sintering temperature and observed that the pure MnZn ferrite had pure spinel structure and at 673K sample had cubic spinel structure.

[186] observed from the XRD analysisthat MnZn ferrites had a single phase cubic spinel structure with characteristic (311) reflection on 2\u04e8=34.58 and no diffraction peak due to impurity was observed. The broad diffraction peaks were observed showing ultrafine nature and small crystallite size. The lattice parameter showed a decreasing value from 8.4466\u00c5 to 8.4164\u00c5 with increasing Zn content and the density increased from 5.13g/cm 3 to 5.32g/cm 3 . Phong et al. [112] observed that the XRD pattern showed single phase spinel cubic structure with Fd3m space group. The lattice parameter was calculated 8.432\u00c5 and x-ray density was 5.27g/cm 3 . The average crystallite size was 14nm. Further from the XRD patterns [30] , it was observed that the cubic spinel phase was formed and slight contraction was observed in lattice parameter from 8.4749\u00c5 to 8.4353\u00c5 as Zn concentration increased because Zn 2+ ions (0.082nm ionic radii) replaced Mn 2+ ions (ionic radii=0.091nm). The value of sintered density increased from 4.93g/cm 3 to 4.96g/cm 3 with increase in Zn content.Jalaiah et al. [187] observed that the lattice parameter found to vary from 8.4555\u00c5 to 8.5758\u00c5. The average crystallite size was calculated by the Scherer's formula and was found to be in the range 10nm.In the XRD pattern as observed by Angadi et al. [189] observed the Braggs reflections that indicate the crystalline nature of the samples with cubic spinel structure corresponding to Fd3m space group. When Sc 3+ concentration was increased, the peak shifted towards the lower 2\u04e8 angle because of the relative difference between the ionic radii of Sc 3+ (0.745\u00c5) with that of Fe 3+ (0.55\u00c5).A decrease in the lattice parameterwas observed from8.434\u00c5 to 8.431\u00c5 on Sc 3+ doping which could be due to presence of Sc 3+ ions at the grain boundaries. In the XRD patternspeaks showed the cubic spinel structure [190] . The lattice parameter of pure MnZn ferrite increased with increase in sintering temperature from 8.3383\u00c5 to 8.3496\u00c5 and decreased in Mg doped MnZn ferrite from 8.3542\u00c5 to 8.3225\u00c5 with increasing sintering temperature. Bulk density decreased with increase in sintering temperature from 4.87g/cm 3 to 4.45 g/cm 3 in pure MnZn ferrite and from 4.61g/cm 3 to 4.57g/cm 3 in Mg doped MnZn ferrite due to discontinuous grain growth. Islam et al. [128] studied structural, magnetic and electrical properties of Gd-substituted Mn-Zn mixed ferrites. From the XRD patterns it was concluded thatfor the sample without Gd doping, the ferrite was perfectly single phase spinel and as there was anincrease in the Gd concentration, some unindexed peak as secondary phase appeared. With the increase in Gd content, the lattice parameter also increased from 8.4645\u00c5 to 8.4750\u00c5. In the XRD patterns of Al doped MnZn ferrite observed by Haralkar [184] , the formation of cubic spinel ferrite structure was observed. It was observed that the lattice parameter decreased from 8.445\u00c5 to 8.385\u00c5 with increasing value of x due to the replacement of Fe 3+ (0.67\u00c5) ions by Al 3+ (0.51\u00c5). The value of X-ray density also decreased from 5.202g/cm 3 to 4.989g/cm 3 with increase in Al content. The crystallite size decreased from 19nm to 11nm with increase in Al content.From the study of Yadav et al [182] ,the XRD pattern showed spinel structure without any impurity. Also, the graphs had very broad peaks indicating the ultrafine nature and small crystallite size of ferrites. The lattice parameter increased from 8.4052\u00c5 to 8.4219\u00c5 with increase in Sm 3+ concentration.",

With the increase in Indium concentration, the XRD peaks shifted towards higher angle. This showed some lattice distortion in the cubic structure. The crystallite size increased from 14.6nm to 15.9nm with increasing doping concentration. The lattice constant increased from 8.391\u00c5 to 8.418\u00c5. Also, the x-ray density increased from 5.315g/cm 3 to 5.445 g/cm 3 . XRD graphs of MnZn ferrite for various compositions and with Indium doping are shown in figure 11 . The characteristics peaks match with the ferrite particles and show the phase group Fd3m and spinel structure having single phase. Hence, it is concluded that the MnZn ferrites have single phase spinel cubic structure with Fd3m phase group; however some distortion in the structure can be observed because of doping.",

            "text": "Various techniques such as AFM, TEM, and SEM etc. are used to investigate the morphological structureof the ferrite nanoparticles. SEM is widely used for it but TEM is better than SEM because of poor resolution of SEM. AFM is a technique that can be used in different conditions like air, vacuum, liquid and moist conditions.Winiarska et al. [205] observed that the TEM gave core shell type structure formation.Mirsekari et al. [204] found from the SEM micrographs that the morphology of MnZn ferrite was porous, sponge like and agglomerated with an average particle size of 2\u00b5m. Anwar et al. [9] observed from the SEM micrographs that the particles were spherical in shape.Gabal et al. [206] studies showed that TEM morphology showed very strong agglomeration of the cubic particles, having some particles in one line. From the SEM micrographs [192] , mean grain diameter was observed 7.88\u00b10.4\u00b5m.In Phong observation [112] the TEM images showed that the ferrites had homogeneous structure and spherical in shape. Particles showed agglomeration due to slow particle growth.In the SEM analysis of the Ni doped ferrite done by Jalaiah [187] , the presence of aggregates of small grains at the surface of the higher nickel containing samples was observed. In the TEM analysis done by Angadi et al. [189] the particles were lightly agglomerated due to their slow growth of particles during the preparation. The particle size of pure Mn 0.5 Zn 0.5 Fe 2 O 4 was about 20nm. The TEM images showed that the electron diffraction pattern consisted of concentric rings with spots over the rings showing that the samples were crystalline in nature. The particle size lies between 20 and 23nm. From the SEM images [190] , it was concluded that polyhedral morphology with nonuniform grains were displayed for both pure and doped MnZnferrites. Pure MnZn ferrites sintered at 1150\u2103 had average grain size of 2.10\u00b5m having well defined grain boundaries and the sample sintered at 1200\u2103 and 1250\u2103 had grain size of 2.84\u03bcm and 3.13\u00b5m. In case of Mg doped ferrites, grain size increased with sintering temperature from 2.00 to 3.10\u00b5m. From the TEM images [84] , it was concluded that the molecules were spherical in shape and particles were aggregated. From the SEM analysis by Yadav et al. [182] , it was observed that particle size increased with Sm content but bigger particles were formed by the agglomeration of ultra fine particles. The TEM images showed that all the particles were nearly spherical in shape and average particle size was 10-20nm. SEM analysis [183] showed the uniform, spherical shaped and loosely agglomerated particles. The shape of the MnZn ferrites is usually spherical and having particle size in the 9-23nm range. The SEM images of the pure MnZn ferrites are shown in figure 12 that shows spherical structure of the ferrite nanoparticles and in figure 13 SEM images shows elongated nature of the ferrite nanoparticles. Also, the TEM images of pure MnZn ferrite nanoparticles are shown in figure 14.",

            "text": "FT-IR stands for Fourier transform Infrared, the method that is used for infrared spectroscopy. In infrared spectroscopy, IR radiation is passed through a sample. Some of the infrared radiation is absorbed by the sample and some is passed through or transmitted. The resulting spectrum represents the molecular absorption and transmission, creating a molecular fingerprint of the sample. Islam et al. [128] recorded the FTIR spectra of MnZn ferrite nanoparticles in the range from 250cm -1 to 4000cm -1 .In the FTIR spectra [184] , the value of the absorption band \u2c71 1 around 600cm -1 remained almost constant whereas the value of absorption spectra \u2c71 2 around 400cm -1 decreased from 548cm -1 to 528cm -1 . This is because of the difference in Fe 3+ -O 2distance for tetrahedral and octahedral sites. The absorption bands in the region 1200cm -1 -1500cm -1 correspond to NO 3 ions, absorption band at 1700cm -1 showed carboxyl group COOand at 2300cm -1 correspond to hydrogen bonded O-H groups.In the FTIR spectra [189] , two prominent absorption bands nearly at 540cm -1 (\u2c71 1 ) and 360cm -1 (\u2c71 2 ) observed were attributed to the tetrahedral and the octahedral complexes. The difference between these two values was due to the relative changes in bond length (Fe-O) at tetrahedral (A) sites and octahedral (B) sites.The FTIR spectra recorded by Gabal [206] in the range 600cm -1 -200cm -1 showed high frequency band (\u2c71 1 ) increased with increasing Zn content due to vibrational spectra of metal ion-oxygen complex in the tetrahedral sites, while value of lower frequency band (\u2c71 2 ) due to vibration in the octahedral site, slightly changed. FTIR of all compounds showed the formation of spinel phase.Ciocarlan et al. [103] synthesized Mn ferrite along with Ni ferrite, Zn ferrite and Co ferrite and studied their various properties. Formation of spinel phase is observed from FT-IR spectra of all the compounds as shown in figure 17 (b).",

            "text": "MnZn ferrites are the magnetic materials with very low power loss so that they can be used n many electronic applications. Aiping 2006 et al. [123] synthesized MnZn ferrites using conventional ceramic processing technique and studied the effect of SnO 2 addition the magnetic properties of the prepared ferrite. It was observed that there is overall decrease in the loss factor with increase in SnO 2 concentration. Also, power loss and minimum power loss decreased with increase in the doping of SnO 2 as shown in figure 16 (c).Jalaiah et al. [187] . The core losses measured at 100 kHz and 200mT showed that the core losses for all samples decreased firstly and then increased with increasing temperature further. The power loss for unsubstituted and Ti 4+ sample was higher at room temperature. Also, temperature of minimum in P L~T curve shifts to lower temperature for Ti 4+ and Sn 4+ substituted samples. At low frequencies the there was power losses only due to eddy current loss P e and hysteresis loss P h . The P h decreased with increasing temperature firstly up to 80 0 C and then increased with further increase in temperature and it was minimum for Sn 4+ doping. The P e of all samples were relatively low and there was a slight change at low temperature but there was a sharp increase at high temperature as shown in figure 16 (a), (b) as the starting materials. The power loss vs. temperature plot showed that the power loss decreased firstly and then increased with an increase in temperature showing lowest loss point between 60\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C. Power loss reduced as the concentration of additives was increased. Also, both the hysteresis loss and the eddy current loss decreased with increase in concentration of additives and after reaching minima for concentration of TiO 2 and Nb 2 O 5 , 0.03 wt% and 0.02 wt% increased further. This is because as small amount of Ti 4+ and Nb 5+ ions were entered into the grains cause an increase in Fe 2+ ions , which lead to positive K 1 values and decrease the hysteresis loss. Further increasing the dopant concentration cause excessive increase in Fe 2+ ions, which make K 1 value more positive and increase the hysteresis loss. When the concentration of TiO 2 and Nb 2 O 5 was less than 0.03wt% and 0.02 wt%, the grain and grain boundary resistivity both increased and hence, the eddy current loss decreased as eddy current loss is inversely proportional to resistivity. Further increase in additives concentration decreased the resistivity, causing the eddy current loss to increase. Anwar et al. [9] studied the effect of sintering temperature on various structural, electrical and dielectric parameters of MnZn ferrites using the co-precipitation method for the synthesis of Mn 0.5 Zn 0.5 Fe 2 O 4 . The dielectric constant decreased very sharply in low frequency region and slowed down in high frequency region almost approached to frequency independent nature. It exhibit dielectric dispersion. From the plot of loss tangent vs. frequency it was observed that the loss tangent decreased initially with increase in frequency and then showed a relaxation peak. It is observed from all this data that MnZnnanoferrites have very low power loss to be used suitably in making various electronic appliances.",

            "text": "Saturation magnetization is the saturation value of magnetization of a ferromagnetic body. The inside of the magnetic body is normally divided into many number of domains, but as the external magnetic field increases, domain walls may move and magnetization may rotate within domains, so the magnetic body comes in single-domain state. The magnetization saturation is reached if the easy magnetization axis and the external magnetic field direction match and the value of the magnetization at this time is called the saturation magnetization. The value of this saturation magnetization of MnZn ferrites is high [141, 162] in comparison to other ferrites. Syue et al. [188] observedthe value of saturation magnetization increased from 11-62emu/g with increasing Mn 2+ content and saturates further.The value of saturation magnetization remained in the range 11.090emu/g to 60.868emu/g [188] when combustion method is used without subsequent heat treatments. Praveena et al. [179] observed that the value of saturation magnetization (M s ) increased from 53.33Am 2 /Kg to 78.26Am 2 /Kg with increase in zinc content and then decreased to 10.74Am 2 /kg if zinc content is further increased. From the hysteresis curves Mirsekari et al. [204] observed that the saturation magnetization decreased from 69 to 34 emu/g.Gabal et al. [186] observed the value saturation magnetization M s increased from 32.9emu/g to 37.6emu/g,then decreasedto 25.9emu/g and again increased to 43.7emu/g.The value of saturation magnetization was found to be 27.7emu/g in Phong [112] experiment showed the properties of superspin glass and supermagnetismbehavior.The study of Zapata [30] showed that the M s value decreased from 36.22emu/g to 30.78emu/g with increase in Zn concentration. This was due to the fact that increased Zn content decreased the ferric ions on the A sites and this reduced the A-B interaction. The saturation magnetization (M s ) [187] decreased firstly from 120.896emu/gm to 114.888emu/gm with increase in Ni concentration and then increased to 137.246emu/gm with further increase in Ni concentration as shown in figure 13 . This decrease was due to the occupation of Ni 2+ ions in octahedral B sites.Angadi et al. [171] observed thatFrom the M-H loops recorded by VSM the variation of saturation magnetization(M s ) increased with increasing Sc 3+ doping from 24.6emu/g to 31.48emu/g and then decreased further to 23.45emu/g. Hence, the Sc 3+ doped Mn-Zn ferrites are useful for modern technological applications as well as low and high frequency applications. Islam et al. [128] observed that the value of saturation magnetization decreased from 51.2emu/gm to 40.3emu/gm with an increase in Gd content. By doping Al in pure MnZn ferrite [184] the saturation magnetization decreased with increase in Al content.Hysteresis loops measurements by Yadav et al. [182] showed that the value of saturation magnetization increased from 23.95emu/gm to 42.10emu/gm.Due to this, high value of magnetization MnZn ferrites are used in the field of power applications.",

            "text": "The coercivity is also called as coercive field and coercive force. It is defined as the ability of a ferromagnetic material to withstand an external magnetic field without demagnetizing it. In case of a ferromagnetic material, it is defined as the intensity of applied magnetic field that is required to reduce the magnetization to zero after the saturation state of the magnetization. The materials which have high coercivity are called hard materials and the materials with low value of coercivity are soft materials. The hard materials are used to make the permanent magnets and soft materials are used for making transformers, inductor cores and microwave devices. Praveena et al. [179] found the coercivity value varying in the range 0.0149Oe-0.0172Oe for Mn 1-x Zn x Fe 2 O 4 (x=0.0-1.0). From the hysteresis curves Mirsekari et al. [204] observed that the coercivity decreased from 60Oe to 45Oe with increasing x from 0.2 to 0.8. The coercivity as calculated by Gabal [186] showed decreasing trend. It decreased from 94.2Oe to 67.1Oe for x=0.2-0.6 and then increased to 80.7Oe for x=0.8.Phong et al. [112] studied the properties of MnZn ferrites and found that the coercivity was 130Oe at 10K.Jalaiah et al. [187] observed from his experiment that the coercivity values of the Mn 0.85 Zn 0.15 Ni x Fe 2 O 4 (x=0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12 and 0.15) samples increased with nickel concentration from 0.123Oe to 0.24Oe because of the decrease in the porosity with increasing dopant concentration. Also, the coercivity decreased from 87Oe to 11Oe with increasing Al 3+ concentration [184] .The low value of coercivity of MnZn ferrite put these ferrites in the class of soft ferrites and these are used in applications like making transformer cores, microwave devices and inductors.",

MnZn ferrites are most suitable for their use in the microwave devices because of high permittivity, high resistivity, high stability, high value of saturation magnetization, high curie temperature with low eddy current and low magnetic losses [246, 247] . Due to the use of ferrite nanomaterials, electronic devices can be mechanically hard, chemically stable and permit the materials to operate properly at a wide frequency range [248] . There are a lot of advantages of the use of MnZn ferrites in the microwave devices. There is a decrease in the emission of unwanted EM waves from the device and also it absorbs the incoming EM waves that may harm the microwave device. MnZn ferrites are used in microwave systems because of their low loss and high saturation magnetization. Wang et al. [249] synthesized MnZn ferrite nanoparticles and the result showed that because of high reflection loss and broad absorbing band in low frequency (10MHz to 1GHz) these ferrites can be used in electromagnetic microwave absorbing field.",

            "text": "The radiations emitting from radar results in the increase in electromagnetic radiation pollution in the environment. These radiations reduce the efficiency and performance of electronic instruments and thus decrease their lifetime and safety. As MnZn ferrite belongs to the class of soft ferrites having high electrochemical stability, high permeability, high saturation magnetization and low power losses, it is used in many electronic applications [65, 79, 128, 167, 199, 209, 210] .Ferrite nanoparticles can be used in the radar absorbing devices due to their high value of curie temperature and temperature stability. Also the ferrite nanoparticles are environmentally safe that make their use easier in the radar absorbing devices. The application of MnZn ferrites in radar absorbing system is also attracting the researchers. Praveena et al. [252] synthesized Ni 0.4 Zn 0.2 Mn 0.4 Fe 2 O 4 nano ferrites for radar absorbing. The high value of Curie temperature indicated homogeneity and temperature stability. The EPR spectra showed reduction in the peak width and increase in relaxation with increase in sintering temperature. These all results showed that the ferrite nanoparticles can be used for radar absorbing from few MHz to 2 GHz and also these materials are environmentally safe. By carefully controlling Zn 2+ doping level, nanoparticles of size 15 nm with single crystallinity and size monodispersity (s<5%) and having high magnetization value (175 emu g -1 ) were obtained. The nanoparticles provided the large MRI contrast effects (r2 = 860 mm -1 s -1 ) with an eight to fourteen fold increase in MRI contrast and a fourfold enhancement in hyperthermic effects compared to conventional iron oxide nanoparticles. This enhancement was significant for clinical purposes as the nanoparticle probe dosage level can be progressively lowered when using probes that have improved contrast enhancement effects. For (Zn x Mn 1-x )Fe 2 O 4 nanoparticles, Zn 2+ ions mainly occupy tetrahedral sites of the spinel matrix which was confirmed by using extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis to examine the Zn and Fe K-edges. To detect small sized pathogenic targets precisely at an early stage, MRI contrast agents are often used to highlight those specific areas of interest. Due to high imaging contrast effects, magnetic nanoparticles can increase the difference between pathogenic targets and normal tissues via MRI. One of the most appropriate ways to increase the MR contrast effects is the optimization of saturation magnetization (Ms) that is directly related to the relaxivity coefficient (r2). The relaxivity coefficient (r2) is determined by a slope of R2 against nanoparticle concentration and often used as an indicator for contrast effects. The relaxivity coefficient (r2) of contrast agents can be tuned and further enhanced by engineering magnetic parameters [253] .",

MnZn ferrites have applications in field of bio-medical and hyperthermia [112] . Hurtado et al. [257] synthesized MnZn ferrite along with activated carbon composite for use in bio-medical applications. MnZn ferrites can be used to make ferrofluid [182] due to high value of saturation magnetization. Arulmurugan et al. [76] synthesized Co-Zn and Mn-Zn ferrite nanoparticles and found that because of low curie temperature and high value of thermomagnetic coefficient, these ferrites can be used for preparing temperature sensitive ferrofluid.Praveena et al. [258] synthesized Mn-Zn ferrite nanoparticles for high frequency applications. The ferrites had low power loss in frequency range 10Hz-1MHz. The constructed transformer with the ferrite material showed high efficiency and low surface temperature rise at frequency 1 MHz making it suitable for operating at high frequencies. 7.6.MnZn for onging COVID-19 pandemics: As nanomaterials are making a global impact on healthcare and socioeconomic development so are the viruses during pandemics. Nanoparticles of MnZn have unique physical and chemical properties that have associated benefits in development of potential therapeutic drugs, nanomaterial based environment friendly antiviral sprays, drug delivery and to develop anti-viral surface coatings in home appliances. This is attributed to the fact that the choice of synthesis method provides size and chargetunability properties to the MnZn. The size tunablity ensures that large amount of drug can be delivered into anatomically privileged sites of the virus while charge tunability would facilitate entry of drug in to charged parts of the virus [260] . In addition, biosensors for the early detection of viral strains such the COVID 19 can also be developed withMnZn. For instance MnZn can readily be used to before Gaint magnetoresistance sensors which have previously been used for virus detection [261] .",

            "text": "The synthesis of MnZn particles has increased in last ten years and most progress can be seen in the year 2016. Due to the fascinating properties of MnZn ferrites among the class of soft ferrites like high value of saturation magnetization, low value of coercivity, high initial permeability, narrow size distribution of the ferrite particles, low remenant magnetization, the researchers are taking interest in the synthesis of these ferrites.The co-precipitation and sol-gel method is best for getting the fine crystallite size among all synthesis techniques. The XRD pattern of the MnZn ferrites has characteristic peaks showing the cubic spinel phase having Fd3m phase group. The shape of the prepared ferrite is nearly spherical but some distortion may be observed after doping. FTIR spectra confirmed the spinel phase of the ferrite nanoparticles having tetrahedral and octahedral sites.The value of saturation magnetization is highest when we synthesize the MnZn ferrites with proper amount of nickel doping by using sol-gel auto combustion method. Also, for getting the low value of coercivity sol-gel method is preferred. Generally, MnZn ferrites have a lot of applications including biomedical field, electronic devices, for making radar absorbing materials, for making ferrofluids etc. For more enhancing the applications and advantageous properties of MnZn ferrite nanoparticles, further studies are required.The electrical and magnetic properties of MnZn ferrites can be enhanced by doping other metals such as cobalt, zinc, magnesium to make them suitable for use in agricultural and electrical applications. In the context of use of nanoparticles in thepandemic outbreak, such as in the recent COVID-19,MnZn soft ferrites can play a significant role in the development of high contrast imaging dyes for viral strains in body fluids. Perhaps MnZn can also serve as a candidate nanomaterial for developing nanomaterial based medicines and therapeutics.
