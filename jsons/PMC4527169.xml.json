            "text": "Interferon-\u03bb (IFN-\u03bb), also termed type III IFN or interleukin-28 (IL-28) and IL-29, belongs to a cytokine family that shares functional similarities with the family of type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and/or IFN-\u03b2 [hereafter IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2]). IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 are multi-gene families composed of closely related cytokines each with specific heterodimeric receptors: IFNLR (IFNLR1 and IL10R\u03b2) for IFN-\u03bb and IFNAR (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. Humans have genes encoding four IFN-\u03bb proteins (IFN-\u03bb1 [IL-29], IFN-\u03bb2 [IL-28A], IFN-\u03bb3 [IL-28B], and IFN-\u03bb4) as well as 17 IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 proteins (13 IFN-\u03b1 subtypes, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03c9, IFN-\u03b5, and IFN-\u03ba). In contrast to the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 family, which was described almost 60 years ago (Isaacs and Lindenmann, 1957), the IFN-\u03bb family was discovered more recently. Human IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2, and IFN-\u03bb3 were identified in 2003 (Kotenko et al., 2003, Sheppard et al., 2003), and IFNL4 at that time was considered a pseudogene. In 2013, it became clear that many humans have a functional IFNL4 and that a common SNP results in a frameshift mutation that ablates IFN-\u03bb4 production in some populations (Hamming et al., 2013, Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013). Genes encoding type I IFNs characteristically lack introns (with the exception of IFNK) and are syntenic in a single locus on human chromosome 9 and mouse chromosome 4. Genes encoding IFN-\u03bb are located on human chromosome 19 and mouse chromosome 7 and share the 5-exon gene structure characteristic of IL-10 cytokine family members (Sabat, 2010).",

First, the effects of IFN-\u03bb are most evident in epithelial cells, suggesting that it contributes to the specialized immune mechanisms that protect epithelial surfaces, which undergo constant exposure to commensal and pathogenic microbes (Durbin et al., 2013, Hermant and Michiels, 2014, Mahlak\u00f5iv et al., 2015). Second, because of the more focused nature of its signaling effects, IFN-\u03bb might share the therapeutic benefits yet avoid many of the side effects that have limited the clinical use of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Donnelly et al., 2011, Hermant and Michiels, 2014, Markowitz, 2007, Pagliaccetti and Robek, 2010, Pestka, 2007). Third, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have revealed multiple IFNL polymorphisms that are linked to clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and possibly improved outcomes with other viral infections, including hepatitis B virus (HBV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) (Egli et al., 2014c, Galmozzi et al., 2014, Griffiths et al., 2015, Lampertico et al., 2013, Manuel et al., 2015).",

We highlight a specialized role for IFN-\u03bb in providing antiviral activity at anatomic barriers, including epithelial surfaces and the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Because epithelial surfaces experience constant microbial exposure, IFN-\u03bb might provide more targeted antiviral protection at key barrier sites without activating a systemic pro-inflammatory immune response.",

            "text": "IFN expression occurs after host detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by specific pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) (Swiecki and Colonna, 2011; Figure 1\n). Although most PRRs responsible for inducing expression of IFN-\u03bb overlap those triggering IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression, the cytosolic DNA sensor Ku70 activates the expression of IFN-\u03bb but not IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Zhang et al., 2011). Transcription factors activated downstream of PRR signaling include interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and NF-\u03baB. The suite of PRRs and transcription factors expressed by a cell contributes to the specific capabilities and magnitude of the IFN response following infection (Hillyer et al., 2012). For example, IFN-\u03b2 is induced early after activation of PRRs because its promoter is bound by IRF-3, which is constitutively expressed, whereas most IFN-\u03b1 subtypes are induced preferentially by IRF-7, which is itself encoded by an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) (G\u00e9nin et al., 2009). Initial characterization of promoter regions upstream of IFNL1 and IFNL3 identified binding elements for IRF-1, IRF-3, IRF-7, and NF-\u03baB, and the combined activity of IRFs and NF-\u03baB was required for maximal gene induction (Onoguchi et al., 2007, Osterlund et al., 2007, Thomson et al., 2009). Subsequent analysis of the response to TLR9 agonists showed that IFN-\u03bb induction exhibits a greater dependence on NF-\u03baB than does IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 induction (Iversen et al., 2010). These findings suggest that, despite similarities, there are promoter features that discriminate IFNL and IFNA/B induction.",

Med23, a component of the Mediator complex, interacts with IRF-7 and enhances transcription from the IFNL1 promoter, but not the IFNB promoter; the resulting increase in IFN-\u03bb production inhibits HSV-1 replication (Griffiths et al., 2013). A bioinformatic and biochemical analysis of the region upstream of human IFNL1 identified binding sites for the transcription factors ZEB1 and BLIMP-1. Experiments using chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene silencing established that ZEB1 and BLIMP-1 bind the IFNL1 promoter and repress transcription in airway and intestinal epithelial cell lines (Siegel et al., 2011, Swider et al., 2014). ZEB1 activity is specific to IFNL1 and does not regulate IFNB expression. BLIMP-1 functions as a repressor by displacing binding of IRF-1 (Siegel et al., 2011), which is required for IFNL1, but not IFNB, transcription (Odendall et al., 2014). Although both IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b2 are induced downstream of PRR sensing and activation of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), IFN-\u03bb production is favored when activated MAVS localizes to the peroxisome, whereas IFN-\u03b2 production is dominant when MAVS localizes to the mitochondria (Odendall et al., 2014). The relative abundance of peroxisomes in epithelial cells suggests a mechanism for preferential production of IFN-\u03bb instead of IFN-\u03b2 in response to viral infection at epithelial surfaces. In hepatocytes, HBV infection stimulated production of IFN-\u03bb but not IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, and this IFN-\u03bb induction depended on recognition by RIG-I and signaling through MAVS (Sato et al., 2015). Similarly, HCV infection preferentially induced IFN-\u03bb over IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Marukian et al., 2011, Park et al., 2012, Thomas et al., 2012), suggesting that liver-specific factors might promote IFN-\u03bb production in response to these unrelated hepatotropic viruses.",

In the small intestine, epithelial cells and immune cells both respond to poly I:C stimulation, suggesting that multiple cell types produce IFN-\u03bb cooperatively (Mahlak\u00f5iv et al., 2015). Although gut immune cells treated with poly I:C produce IFN-\u03b15, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb2, and IFN-\u03bb3, gut epithelial cells exclusively generate IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3 (Mahlak\u00f5iv et al., 2015), perhaps reflecting their peroxisome content (Odendall et al., 2014). There also are differences in the IFN induction profile within the myeloid cell compartment after stimulation with PRR agonists. Whereas plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) produce nearly all IFNs (including IFN-\u03bb), monocytes and myeloid DCs more selectively express IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb1, and IFN-\u03bb2 (Hillyer et al., 2012). Similarly, CD8\u03b1+ DCs are the major IFN-\u03bb-producing myeloid cell type in response to poly I:C in mice (Lauterbach et al., 2010).",

The structure of IFN-\u03bb resembles that of members of the IL-10 family, although the primary amino acid sequence is more similar to that of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Gad et al., 2009, Miknis et al., 2010). Whereas all type I IFNs signal through a shared heterodimeric receptor, IFNAR (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2), type III IFNs bind to IFNLR, a unique heterodimeric receptor. IFNLR consists of one subunit that it shares with other IL-10 family cytokines (IL10R\u03b2) and a second that is specific to IFN-\u03bb (IFNLR1, also called IL28R\u03b1). Despite the structural similarities between IFN-\u03bb and IL-10 family cytokines (i.e., IL-10, IL-19, IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, and IL-26), the crystal structure of IFN-\u03bb1 bound to IFNLR1 revealed a distinct receptor-binding interaction, including a 1:1 stoichiometry between IFN-\u03bb1 and IFNLR1 (compared to 2:1 between IL-10 and IL10R\u03b1) (Miknis et al., 2010). The impact of the shared IL10R\u03b2 chain on interactions between IFN-\u03bb and other IL-10 family cytokines remains unclear. IFN-\u03bb activity was enhanced by an IL-10-blocking antibody and was inhibited in the presence of IL-10 (Jordan et al., 2007a), suggesting possible competition for IL10R\u03b2 interaction. In contrast, IL-22 (which signals through IL10R\u03b2 and IL22R\u03b1) enhanced the signaling and antiviral effects of IFN-\u03bb (Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2015). Although IFNAR and IL10R\u03b2 are expressed broadly on many cell types and tissues, IFNLR1 is expressed preferentially on epithelial cells (Mahlak\u00f5iv et al., 2015, Sommereyns et al., 2008). Consistent with this pattern, the antiviral effects of IFN-\u03bb are most evident against pathogens targeting epithelial tissues.",

These signaling pathways have been reviewed in detail elsewhere (Donnelly and Kotenko, 2010, Durbin et al., 2013, Hoffmann et al., 2015, Kotenko, 2011) and include activation of JAK-family kinases, phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, and association between activated STAT complexes and IRF-9 to form ISGF3, which translocates to the nucleus and induces expression of hundreds of ISGs. Similar to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling, IFN-\u03bb signaling induces JAK1 and TYK2 phosphorylation (Dumoutier et al., 2004, Fran\u00e7ois-Newton et al., 2011, Ma et al., 2009). Additionally, JAK2 phosphorylation is induced specifically by IFN-\u03bb (Odendall et al., 2014, Odendall and Kagan, 2015), suggesting that distinct upstream signaling events might differentiate IFN-\u03bb activity from IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 activity. In addition to activating STAT1 and STAT2, IFNAR and IFNLR ligand engagement can activate other STAT family members (STAT3, STAT4, and STAT5) and STAT-independent signaling cascades (MAPK and ERK) (Cohen and Prince, 2013, Koch and Finotto, 2015).",

            "text": "The transcriptional responses induced by IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 are similar (Bolen et al., 2014, Doyle et al., 2006, Kohli et al., 2012, Lazear et al., 2015, Marcello et al., 2006, Shindo et al., 2013, Zhou et al., 2007). No transcriptional signatures unique to IFN-\u03bb have been identified, and the genes induced by IFN-\u03bb typically represent a subset of the total induced by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. The IFN-\u03bb transcriptional response generally is of lower magnitude than that of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and might exhibit a delayed peak and longer duration (Marcello et al., 2006), although different expression levels of IFNAR and IFNLR might confound comparisons. Differential effects of negative regulators might contribute to the sustained signaling pattern observed for IFN-\u03bb in comparison to that of IFN-\u03b1. For example, the ISG USP18 desensitizes cells to further IFN-\u03b1 stimulation but does not inhibit IFN-\u03bb signaling (Fran\u00e7ois-Newton et al., 2011). Among the IFN-\u03bb subtypes, IFN-\u03bb3 (followed by IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb2) has the most potent bioactivity (Bolen et al., 2014, Dellgren et al., 2009). These differences in potency are unexpected, given that IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3 are nearly identical (96% amino acid identity) (Sheppard et al., 2003). IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb signaling both amplify IFN production, for example, via the induction of the transcription factors IRF-1 and IRF-7 (Bolen et al., 2014, Kohli et al., 2012, Lazear et al., 2015). Because of these shared positive-feedback systems, transcriptional profiling in cells lacking IFNAR or IFNLR (or in the presence of protein-synthesis inhibitors) might be needed for distinguishing bona fide IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2- and IFN-\u03bb-induced genes. Independent of whether there truly are IFN-\u03bb-specific transcriptional signatures, the ability to induce a narrower set of ISGs in a more targeted set of cells suggests possible therapeutic applications in which IFN-\u03bb could promote a more focused antiviral or immunomodulatory response with fewer side effects than IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Hermant and Michiels, 2014, Muir et al., 2014). Given that most IFN-\u03bb transcriptional profiling experiments have focused on human liver cells, further studies are needed in other tissues where antiviral effects of IFN-\u03bb have been reported.",

            "text": "IFNLR is expressed at relatively high levels in respiratory epithelial cells, and mice treated with IFN-\u03bb prior to infection with human metapneumovirus (HMPV) develop lower viral titers and reduced inflammatory responses (Ba\u00f1os-Lara et al., 2015). Accordingly, Ifnlr1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infections, including influenza virus, HMPV, respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS coronavirus (Crotta et al., 2013, Hermant and Michiels, 2014, Mahlak\u00f5iv et al., 2012, Mordstein et al., 2008, Mordstein et al., 2010b). Human myeloid and bronchial epithelial cells produce IFN-\u03bb in response to rhinovirus infection, and IFN-\u03bb inhibits rhinovirus replication in bronchial epithelial cells (Contoli et al., 2006). Correspondingly, production of IFN-\u03bb correlates inversely with viral load and disease severity in humans experimentally inoculated with rhinovirus (Contoli et al., 2006). Respiratory epithelial cells respond to both IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Mahlak\u00f5iv et al., 2015), and cultured cells respond to IFN-\u03bb from both the apical and basolateral surfaces (Fox et al., 2015, Hamming et al., 2013). IFN-\u03bb is the dominant IFN produced by respiratory epithelial cells after infection with influenza virus or other respiratory viruses (Crotta et al., 2013, Fox et al., 2015, Jewell et al., 2010, Okabayashi et al., 2011). This implies a key role for IFN-\u03bb in mediating antiviral immunity in the respiratory tract (Figure 2\nA).",

            "text": "There has been great interest in defining the antiviral role of IFN-\u03bb in the liver, particularly against HCV and HBV infections. IFNLR is expressed by human hepatocytes, the primary cellular targets of these viruses (Figure 2B), and both viruses preferentially stimulate IFN-\u03bb production rather than IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 production (Marukian et al., 2011, Park et al., 2012, Sato et al., 2015, Thomas et al., 2012). GWASs have revealed IFNL polymorphisms that are associated with improved outcome from HCV and HBV infection, both in terms of spontaneous clearance and in response to antiviral therapy (Galmozzi et al., 2014, Ge et al., 2009, Griffiths et al., 2015, Hermant and Michiels, 2014, Lampertico et al., 2013, O\u2019Brien et al., 2014, Russell et al., 2014, Suppiah et al., 2009, Tanaka et al., 2009, Thomas et al., 2009). The different protective alleles identified in these studies imply distinct antiviral mechanisms against HCV. One protective allele in the promoter region of IFNL3 is associated with increased IFN-\u03bb production, which might control infection by enhancing expression of ISGs (for SNP rs8099917, the protective allele is T/T rather than T/G or G/G) (Suppiah et al., 2009, Tanaka et al., 2009). However, an unfavorable allele also is associated with elevated ISG expression and is thought to render cells refractory to further stimulation of antiviral activity (for SNP rs12979860, the protective allele is C/C rather than T/C or T/T) (Ge et al., 2009, Sheahan et al., 2014, Thomas et al., 2009, Urban et al., 2010). In addition to its association with viral hepatitis, rs12979860 predicts the severity of liver inflammation and fibrosis of other etiologies, but with the opposite association (C/C, unfavorable allele) (Eslam et al., 2015). This disparity suggests that ISG expression might differentially affect viral and non-viral liver disease. Another protective allele alters the sequence of the 3\u2032 UTR of IFNL3 such that its transcript is no longer targeted for degradation by microRNAs induced after HCV infection (for SNP rs4803217, the protective allele is G/G rather than T/T) (McFarland et al., 2014). The SNP that is most highly associated with improved HCV outcome is one in which the protective allele has a frameshift insertion that ablates IFN-\u03bb4 production (for SNP rs368234815, the protective allele is TT rather than -G) (Bibert et al., 2013, Hamming et al., 2013, Key et al., 2014, O\u2019Brien et al., 2014, Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013). It remains unclear why the loss of IFN-\u03bb4 confers improved clinical outcome, but several explanations have been proposed: (1) a counter-regulatory role for IFN-\u03bb4, (2) an IFN refractory state induced by high basal expression of IFN-\u03bb4, (3) stimulation of regulatory T cell responses by IFN-\u03bb4, and/or (4) reduced production of the more antiviral IFN-\u03bb3. Because many of the polymorphisms within the IFNL locus exist in high linkage disequilibrium, they often segregate as haplotypes. This has made it difficult to parse out the protective functions of individual SNPs. For example, many of the protective phenotypes initially attributed to rs12979860 (C/C allele) might in fact be caused by the loss of IFN-\u03bb4 production as a result of the highly linked and more recently identified rs368234815 (TT allele).",

Conventional pegylated IFN-\u03b1 therapy is accompanied by side effects that hinder compliance. Given the more restricted expression pattern of IFNLR, and the relatively high amount of IFNLR expression in hepatocytes, IFN-\u03bb could confer many of the antiviral benefits of IFN-\u03b1 in the liver with reduced side effects (Muir et al., 2014). Although direct-acting antiviral agents are supplanting IFN therapy for HCV infection, the therapeutic advantages of IFN-\u03bb might still have utility against HBV, other viral infections, or other hepatic conditions.",

Initial characterization of tissue Ifnlr1 expression in mice demonstrated relatively high expression in the stomach and intestine (Sommereyns et al., 2008), and subsequent studies revealed that epithelial cells are the predominant IFN-\u03bb-responsive cell type in the gastrointestinal tract (Mordstein et al., 2010b, Pott et al., 2011). IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 responsiveness are compartmentalized within the mouse intestine. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 has a minimal effect on intestinal epithelial cells, whereas IFN-\u03bb has a minimal effect on cells of the lamina propria (Mahlak\u00f5iv et al., 2015, Pott et al., 2011). This differential response might be explained by the relatively high expression of IFNLR on intestinal epithelial cells (Mahlak\u00f5iv et al., 2015), as well as the low expression and apical trafficking of IFNAR on these cells (Pott et al., 2011). Although IFNLR1 transcripts are expressed in the human gastrointestinal tract (Sheppard et al., 2003), it remains to be determined whether IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 responsiveness are similarly compartmentalized.",

Rotavirus infects epithelial cells (Lopez and Arias, 2006), reovirus replicates in both epithelial and non-epithelial cells (Forrest and Dermody, 2003), and norovirus grows preferentially in myeloid and B cells but not in epithelial cells (Jones et al., 2014, Karst et al., 2014, Wobus et al., 2004). Rotavirus infection is controlled exclusively by IFN-\u03bb, and there is no defined role for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Angel et al., 1999, Pott et al., 2011). Reovirus is controlled cooperatively by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb, such that IFN-\u03bb limits replication in epithelial cells, and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 restricts infection in non-epithelial cells (Mahlak\u00f5iv et al., 2015). Norovirus infection and dissemination are controlled by IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb, such that IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 prevents extra-intestinal spread, and IFN-\u03bb inhibits the persistent shedding of virus in feces (Nice et al., 2015, Nice et al., 2013). The role for IFN-\u03bb in norovirus infection is apparent only for strains that are persistently shed across the intestinal epithelial barrier into the gut lumen and not for strains causing only acute infection. These studies with genetically and phenotypically unrelated gastrointestinal viruses reveal unique antiviral roles for IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and IFN-\u03bb. In particular, IFN-\u03bb selectively prevents viral shedding into the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract and transmission of fecal-oral viral pathogens.",

            "text": "The trillions of bacteria juxtaposed to the intestinal epithelial barrier are a source of numerous microbial products that are sensed by the immune system. Thus, the IFN-mediated antiviral response in the gastrointestinal tract is modulated by the bacterial microbiome. Indeed, a recent study showed that the bacterial microbiome promotes persistent norovirus infection in an IFNLR-dependent manner (Baldridge et al., 2015). Fecal shedding of norovirus, but not viral entry into Peyer\u2019s patches or extra-intestinal spread, is reduced in mice treated with antibiotics that deplete the bacterial microbiome. This effect of antibiotics on norovirus shedding is diminished in Ifnlr1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, but not in Ifnar1\n\u2212/\u2212, Ifngr1\n\u2212/\u2212, Tlr4\n\u2212/\u2212, Myd88\n\u2212/\u2212, or Trif\n\u2212/\u2212 mice, which lack other innate immune signaling components. The specific requirement for IFNLR in bacterial promotion of norovirus infection contrasts with that in poliovirus and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) infections, where bacterial promotion of viral infection depends on bacterial lipopolysaccharide and TLR4, respectively (Kane et al., 2011, Kuss et al., 2011). However, an additional role of IFN-\u03bb in poliovirus and MMTV infections remains possible because TLR4 signaling and bacterial infection induce IFN-\u03bb (Bierne et al., 2012, Coccia et al., 2004, Contoli et al., 2006, Odendall et al., 2014). Further experiments are required to characterize the intestinal production of and response to IFN-\u03bb in the presence and absence of enteric bacteria. Given the importance of IFN-\u03bb to intestinal immunity in mice, studies to test for linkage between human IFN-\u03bb SNPs and the control of enteric viral infections appear warranted. The studies in mice also suggest that IFN-\u03bb might have therapeutic applications for humans with persistent norovirus infection and gastroenteritis (Bok and Green, 2012).",

Because IFNLR is expressed on epithelial cells, IFN-\u03bb could be particularly important for restricting shedding of chronic viral infections. Consistent with this idea, IFN-\u03bb treatment decreases HSV-2 shedding from the vaginal mucosa in mice (Ank et al., 2006). In humans, SNPs in IFNL3 and IFNL4 have been associated with the ability to clear or control multiple chronic infections, including HCV, HBV, HCMV, and HSV-1 (Bibert et al., 2014, Egli et al., 2014a, Egli et al., 2014c, Griffiths et al., 2015, Griffiths et al., 2013, Lampertico et al., 2013, Manuel et al., 2015). Although the mechanisms by which these polymorphisms affect IFN-\u03bb production and activity remain unclear, these associations suggest that IFN-\u03bb contributes to the control of chronic viral infections in humans. Restricted IFNLR expression within the mucosal epithelium and other key cell types might allow targeted local antiviral responses that control chronic infection and shedding without generating a potentially deleterious systemic pro-inflammatory response. A greater mechanistic understanding of how human SNPs influence IFN-\u03bb expression or function and the study of IFN-\u03bb in additional models of chronic viral shedding are needed.",

The BBB protects the CNS from harmful substances in the periphery, including viruses (Koyuncu et al., 2013). Ifnlr1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited increased BBB permeability after WNV infection and sustained higher viral titers in CNS tissues. Although endothelial cells, including those composing the BBB, do not express high levels of IFNLR, administration of exogenous IFN-\u03bb tightened the BBB, restricted viral neuroinvasion, reduced viral titers in the CNS, and protected mice from lethal viral infection (Figure 2D). These observations are consistent with those of a study demonstrating that IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 also can exert a tightening effect on the BBB (Daniels et al., 2014). IFN-\u03bb tightening of endothelial monolayers in an in vitro model of the BBB did not require STAT1 or de novo protein synthesis, implying that the phenotype occurred via a non-canonical signaling pathway. Although further experiments are needed for determining the specific pathway by which it exerts its effects on BBB integrity, this study suggests that IFN-\u03bb might have therapeutic activity for pathological conditions or viral infections that involve BBB breakdown or permeability.",

In the skin, IFNLR is expressed predominantly on keratinocytes (Witte et al., 2009). The barrier function of keratinocytes is important, as evidenced by the pathology of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, two chronic conditions characterized by epithelial cell hyperproliferation, impaired barrier function, and inflammation (Figure 2E) (Clark, 2013, Leung, 2013, Perera et al., 2012). Patients with atopic dermatitis commonly develop disseminated bacterial (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus) and viral (e.g., HSV, human papillomavirus, and molluscum contagiosum poxvirus) infections in the skin (Christophers and Henseler, 1987, Wollenberg et al., 2003). However, these disseminated infections are not characteristic of psoriasis. Skin lesions from psoriasis patients exhibit higher amounts of IFN-\u03bb1 and enhanced expression of ISGs than do atopic dermatitis lesions, and this occurs in the absence of differential expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Wolk et al., 2013). Although altered epithelial barrier function is a feature of both psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, elevated IFN-\u03bb production and ISG expression provide antiviral protection only in the context of psoriasis.",

In support of this concept, IFNLR signaling induces apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells more potently than IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 (Li et al., 2008) and inhibits growth and colony formation of several different tumor cell lines (Sato et al., 2006).",

IFNLR expression on mammary epithelial cells inversely correlated with tumor growth in a mouse model of breast cancer (Burkart et al., 2013). IFN-\u03bb signaling on mammary epithelial cells promoted production of the chemokine CXCL10, which recruits CD4+ T cells into the tumor microenvironment (Burkart et al., 2013). Tumor models with melanoma, colon carcinoma, and fibrosarcoma cells also demonstrated a role of IFN-\u03bb in triggering anti-tumor NK and T cells (Lasfar et al., 2006, Numasaki et al., 2007, Sato et al., 2006). An increased anti-tumor immune response was apparent even when the tumor cells themselves lacked the ability to respond to IFN-\u03bb (Lasfar et al., 2006, Numasaki et al., 2007). Recent work has demonstrated that Ifnlr1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice are more susceptible to sarcoma formation induced by the carcinogen methylcholanthrene and death in transplanted tumor models (either RMA or B16F10 cells) (Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes et al., 2015). Furthermore, IFN-\u03bb treatment delayed lethality in the B16F10 adoptive cell transfer model and reduced sarcoma development in methylcholanthrene-treated mice (Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes et al., 2015). Despite low levels of IFNLR expression, NK cells might respond directly to IFN-\u03bb in vivo, resulting in enhanced IFN-\u03b3 production and anti-tumor activity (Souza-Fonseca-Guimaraes et al., 2015). Because IFN-\u03bb can alter tumorigenesis directly and indirectly, it might have utility as an adjunctive anti-cancer therapy.",

These data suggest that IFN-\u03bb, in contrast to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, inhibits T cell responses during acute viral infection. This effect was cell extrinsic given that IFNLR signaling was not required on the T cells (Misumi and Whitmire, 2014). However, IFN-\u03bb had a different effect during chronic LCMV infection: Ifnlr1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice infected with LCMV clone 13 had reduced CD8+ T cell expansion and increased weight loss (Misumi and Whitmire, 2014). In comparison, Ifnlr1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice did not show defects in the magnitude or quality of antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses in the spleen or brain after WNV infection (Lazear et al., 2015), indicating that virus-specific host interactions might affect how IFN-\u03bb modulates the adaptive immune response. Additional studies are required to define the role of IFN-\u03bb in adaptive immunity to mucosal infections, where IFNLR is more abundantly expressed.",

The addition of IFN-\u03bb during stimulation of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with concanavalin A or during a mixed lymphocyte reaction reduced the production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) and increased the production of IFN-\u03b3, suggesting that IFN-\u03bb promotes a Th1 response (Dai et al., 2009, Jordan et al., 2007b, Srinivas et al., 2008). Consistent with these data, a SNP (rs8099917, with the T/T allele) in the IFNL3 locus was linked to increased IFN-\u03bb3 production and skewing toward a Th1 response after PBMCs were stimulated with influenza virus (Egli et al., 2014b). Furthermore, administration of IFN-\u03bb as a vaccine adjuvant resulted in reduced expression of the Th2 cytokine IL-4 by HIV gag-specific T cells and reduced numbers and activity of regulatory T cells (Morrow et al., 2009). Collectively, these observations suggest that IFN-\u03bb skews T cell responses toward a Th1 cell bias and away from a Th2 cell bias.",

The T/T allele of SNP rs8099917 was linked to increased production of IFN-\u03bb and decreased seroconversion after influenza vaccination (Egli et al., 2014b). In vitro experiments showed reduced antibody production by PBMCs stimulated with influenza virus in the presence of IFN-\u03bb and increased antibody titers in the presence of an IFNLR-blocking peptide (Egli et al., 2014b). In contrast, a stimulatory effect on humoral response was observed in an HIV vaccine study comparing IFN-\u03bb and IL-12 as adjuvants: the IFN-\u03bb-adjuvanted vaccine resulted in a greater increase in IgG2a responses than did the IL-12-adjuvanted vaccine (Morrow et al., 2009). However, in the context of WNV or LCMV infection, antiviral antibody production was the same between Ifnlr1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice and wild-type animals (Lazear et al., 2015, Misumi and Whitmire, 2014).

Whereas IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling protects against viral infections, it can be detrimental in the context of infection by some bacteria (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes) and parasites (e.g., Leishmania spp.) (Stifter and Feng, 2015). IFN-\u03bb also is induced by bacterial infection (Bierne et al., 2012, Cohen and Prince, 2013, Lebreton et al., 2011, Love et al., 2014, Odendall et al., 2014, Pietil\u00e4 et al., 2010, Travar et al., 2014) and might have consequences during Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas infections: Ifnlr1\n\u2212/\u2212 mice sustained lower bacterial loads and exhibited less pathology without differences in inflammatory cell infiltrates (Cohen and Prince, 2013). Further investigation into the role of IFN-\u03bb in non-viral infections is warranted. The effects of IFN-\u03bb in the context of helminth infections could be especially interesting given its ability to downregulate Th2 responses (Jordan et al., 2007b, Srinivas et al., 2008).",

IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 antagonist mechanisms have been described for many virus families (Hoffmann et al., 2015); because some of these target induction or signaling pathways shared between IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, these same evasion strategies most likely limit the effects of IFN-\u03bb as well. Viruses targeting epithelial tissues might be especially likely to encode specific IFN-\u03bb-evasion mechanisms. Yaba-like disease virus (YLDV) is a primate poxvirus that exclusively infects the skin. Similar to other orthopoxviruses, YLDV encodes a secreted glycoprotein (Y136) that binds to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and blocks IFNAR signaling. Unlike orthologs in vaccinia or variola viruses, Y136 also binds to and inhibits the antiviral effects of IFN-\u03bb (Bandi et al., 2010, Huang et al., 2007). Because the structure of IFN-\u03bb is distinct from that of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Gad et al., 2009), it remains uncertain how a single viral evasion protein targets both IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2. Because they infect epithelial cells and their large genomes enable them to encode a suite of immune evasion molecules (Epperson et al., 2012), other poxviruses and herpesviruses might have evolved analogous or unique mechanisms to antagonize IFN-\u03bb responses.",

Nonetheless, differences in IFN-\u03bb between mice and humans should be considered when one interprets its array of activities. Whereas humans have three or four functional IFNL genes, mice have only two (Ifnl2 and Ifnl3), because the IFNL4 genomic region is absent in mice and mouse Ifnl1 is a pseudogene. Compared to human studies, mouse studies might underestimate some of the contributions of IFN-\u03bb because they lack IFN-\u03bb1.

Infection of P. alecto splenocytes with the paramyxovirus Tioman virus induced the expression of IFN-\u03bb1 but not IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 (Zhou et al., 2011b). It will be interesting to determine whether broader tissue responsiveness to IFN-\u03bb in bats contributes to their ability to serve as reservoir hosts for diverse viruses (Baker et al., 2013).

Alternatively, sustained IFN-\u03bb signaling might impede the activation of more potent antiviral responses and prevent bats from clearing viral infections.",

The frequency of this polymorphism varies, such that the ancestral (IFN-\u03bb4-producing) allele dominates in African populations, and the pseudogene allele has reached near fixation in East Asian populations (Key et al., 2014). The selective pressure driving IFNL4 pseudogenization in humans remains unknown, but GWASs suggest a strong association between the pseudogene allele of IFNL4 and improved outcome after HCV infection (Griffiths et al., 2015, Hamming et al., 2013, Prokunina-Olsson et al., 2013).

            "text": "Since its discovery in 2003, many groups have identified contributions of IFN-\u03bb to antiviral and other immune responses. These studies have prompted a growing appreciation of the unique features that distinguish IFN-\u03bb from IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, and these features provide possibilities for more targeted therapeutic intervention. The ability of IFN-\u03bb to provide antiviral protection at specific tissue sites (e.g., epithelial surfaces) could explain the maintenance of a system that appears somewhat redundant with the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response. Epithelial surfaces could require greater innate immune protection because of their constant exposure to commensal and pathogenic microbes. Constant microbial stimulation at epithelial barriers could require local control without broadly activating a systemic immune response. Thus, IFN-\u03bb signaling could control frequent or persistent low-level infections at epithelial barriers, and the more potent and inflammatory systemic IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response could be reserved for severe infections. This compartmentalized tissue responsiveness to IFN-\u03bb could be utilized therapeutically as a means of achieving antiviral benefit while minimizing systemic side effects associated with inflammation.",

Whereas IFN-\u03bb is induced via many of the same signaling pathways that induce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, Ku70 and peroxisome-localized MAVS preferentially induce IFN-\u03bb. IFN-\u03bb signals through its heterodimeric receptor, IFNLR, which is composed of IFNLR1 and IL10R\u03b2 subunits. Canonical signaling through IFNLR activates JAK1 and TYK2 kinases, which phosphorylate STAT1 and STAT2. However, IFNLR signaling also can activate JAK2 and other downstream signaling pathways (not depicted). JAK-STAT signaling induces expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and the production of effector molecules that inhibit viral infection. Among the ISGs induced by IFN-\u03bb are IRF1 and IRF7, encoding transcription factors IRF-1 and IRF-7, respectively, which amplify IFN production.",

            "text": "Figure\u00a02: Antiviral Effects of IFN-\u03bb at Barrier Surfaces (A) IFN-\u03bb is a dominant IFN produced after viral infection in the respiratory tract. Respiratory epithelial cells can respond to both IFN-\u03bb and IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 to activate an antiviral response. Th1 skewing induced by IFN-\u03bb reduces the severity of allergic asthma. (B) The fenestrated endothelium of the liver creates a tissue architecture in which hepatocytes directly contact blood in liver sinusoids. Hepatocytes are the primary cellular targets for HBV and HCV and are highly responsive to IFN-\u03bb. A role for IFN-\u03bb in controlling HCV infection is suggested by the association between HCV clinical outcome and numerous SNPs within the IFNL locus. (C) IFN-\u03bb has a key role in gastrointestinal tract immunity because unlike respiratory epithelial cells, gut epithelial cells do not respond to IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 and therefore rely upon IFN-\u03bb to activate an antiviral response. The antiviral effects of IFN-\u03bb could be especially important for restricting the shedding and transmission of enteric viruses. Immunity in the gastrointestinal tract is shaped by the bacterial microbiome; the ability of gut microbes to promote viral persistence requires IFN-\u03bb signaling, although the mechanism of this interaction remains unclear. (D) IFN-\u03bb signaling tightens the endothelial junctions of the BBB, which reduces viral neuroinvasion from the circulation. The tightening activity of IFN-\u03bb is STAT1 independent, implicating a non-canonical signaling pathway. (E) Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis are chronic inflammatory skin conditions characterized by breakdown of the epithelial barrier. Compared to lesions from atopic dermatitis patients, psoriasis lesions exhibit elevated IFN-\u03bb production and enhanced expression of ISGs. This might explain why disseminated viral skin infections are common in patients with atopic dermatitis but not psoriasis.",
