Filovirus-induced disease begins with flu-like symptoms and progresses rapidly to the final stages of viral hemorrhagic fever infection, which are characterized by fever, hemorrhage, and hypotensive shock (Groseth et al., 2007, Zampieri et al., 2007). Infection is fatal in up to 90% as in the case of Zaire Ebolavirus or Marburg Angola. The increased frequency of filovirus outbreaks in central and western Africa and the potential use of such agents as biological weapons underscore the need to understand pathogenesis of these viruses and to develop effective intervention strategies (Groseth et al., 2007, Peterson et al., 2004a, Peterson et al., 2004b).",

            "text": "Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are the preferred animal model for human filovirus infection because infection with EBOZ and MARV isolated from humans results in fatal hemorrhagic disease. Numerous species of NHPs have been used, including baboons, African green monkey, rhesus and cynomolgus macaques, to study filovirus pathogenesis because the pathology of infected NHPs is similar to that seen in humans (Bente et al., 2009, Geisbert et al., 2003b). The sporadic nature of disease outbreaks and the ethical issues associated with conducting a human vaccine trial make such a study difficult to execute. Early-stage development of vaccines has historically occurred in mouse and guinea pig models of filovirus disease, but these models use adapted viruses obtained through sequential passage in the rodent species because the wild-type virus does not cause uniform lethality (Bray et al., 1999, Connolly et al., 1999). The disease observed in rodents does not reproduce the extensive disseminated intravascular coagulation seen in human filovirus disease. Besides the requirement for an adapted virus, there are reports that the rodent models are not necessarily predictive of efficacy in NHPs (Feldmann et al., 2003, Geisbert et al., 2002, Jahrling et al., 1996). NHPs are relevant models to study infectious disease as their immune system is similar to humans and they are good predictors of efficacy in vaccine development and other intervention strategies. Licensure of a filovirus vaccine will require testing in a NHP species. The macaque model is the most frequently used model in filovirus efficacy studies involving vaccines or therapies. Given the drawbacks of rodent models of filovirus disease, there is a critical need for development of a small animal model that develops disease consistent with human infection using wild-type virus.",

Experimental EBOV infection of macaques by intramuscular injection of 1000 PFU of virus results in a rapid fatal disease. Beginning at 4 DPI, macaques experienced anorexia coinciding with the onset of fever. Shortly after these initial findings, petechial rash was seen with varying degrees of recumbency, culminating in prostration and death at 7 days post-challenge (Geisbert et al., 2003d). We observed a similar, although shortened (death 4\u20135 DPI), course of disease in marmosets infected with EBOV. Previous work has shown that intramuscular inoculation of macaques with MARV results in an analogous course of disease; however, overall disease progression was delayed with death occurring between days 8 and 13 (Bente et al., 2009, Geisbert et al., 2007, Jaax et al., 1996). Consistent with the macaque model, experimental inoculation of marmosets with MARV also results in delayed onset of disease, with death occurring 3 to 4 days later than that seen with marmosets infected with EBOV. However, the course of Marburg disease in marmosets was more rapid than that seen in macaques, with death occurring at 6 to 8 DPI. Although not statistically significant, it is interesting to note that MARV infected marmosets had an average time to death 1 day shorter than those receiving a high dose of virus.",

Hepatic changes did not appear to be virus dose-dependent, although further animal or morphometric studies would be needed to confirm this. Evidence of mild to moderate hepatocellular fatty change was present. Similar findings have been documented in the macaque model of filovirus infection and most importantly, the findings reported here are comparable to those reported in fatal human cases (Geisbert et al., 2003b, Geisbert et al., 2003c, Geisbert et al., 2008, Jaax et al., 1996).",

            "text": "One difference between the macaque model of filovirus infection and marmosets is that marmosets do not develop a petechial rash. In this respect, they appear to be more similar to the African green monkey model of filovirus infection (Bente et al., 2009, Davis et al., 1997). We speculate that the rapid disease progression preempts its development. Nonetheless, clear signs of coagulation abnormalities are pronounced, as animals experience thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage and bleeding at sites of venipuncture. Fatal human cases are characterized by hemorrhage and bleeding at site of venipuncture and other coagulation abnormalities. The coagulopathy observed in humans at times exists in the absence of rash: only 50% of patients infected with EBOV develop a maculopapular rash (Bwaka et al., 1999). Further evidence that the marmoset mimics human disease is that microscopic examination of tissue from EBOV-infected animals reveals widespread fibrin deposition that is a hallmark of coagulation abnormalities (Geisbert et al., 2003c, Geisbert et al., 2003d, Jaax et al., 1996). EBOV infection of the marmoset caused a severe disseminated viral infection characterized principally by microthrombosis in multiple organs (disseminated intravasculature coagulation). To a lesser degree, MARV-infected animals displayed moderate fibrin deposition in the spleen. A similar observation has been reported for rhesus macaques infected with Marburgvirus Angola where deposition of polymerized fibrin was less pronounced than in EBOV infected macaques (Geisbert et al., 2007). These findings are similar to that seen in human infection and the macaque (Geisbert et al., 2003a, Geisbert et al., 2003b, Geisbert et al., 2003c, Jaax et al., 1996). Signs of coagulopathy characteristic of primate infections are observed variably in rodent models (Bente et al., 2009, Bray et al., 1999, Connolly et al., 1999).",

A 2-log difference in titers is sufficient to predict clinical outcomes (Towner et al., 2004). Inoculation of macaques with either EBOV or MARV results in high viral loads in both blood and tissue (Geisbert et al., 2003d). In the current study, all marmosets had high virus loads (> 106) in blood and tissue regardless of dose or agent. Consistent with human cases, virus was widely disseminated, with the spleen and liver frequently having levels 1-log higher than other tissue. In animals given 1000 PFU EBOV, viral load was 2-logs less than those in animals receiving 10 PFU of virus. This difference could be a result of a rapid onset of morbidity affecting viral load. Virus load in animals infected with MARV was similar and likely the result of relatively longer time to death compared to EBOV animals. It is worthwhile noting that recently it has been shown that filovirus replication results in a surplus of genomes with varying degrees of packaging efficiency and infectious particles. In the in vitro studies, the ratio of RNA to focus forming units was 100-fold more in EBOV versus MARV (Weidmann et al., 2011). Taking this into account, the difference in virus load between MARV and EBOV infected marmosets may be correspondingly different.",

There was evidence of extensive lymphocytic necrosis focused in medullary and parafollicular regions, while follicles were spared. These changes were accompanied by hemorrhage, neutrophilic infiltration and extensive fibrin deposition (Fig. 2F). Findings suggest initial activation within T lymphocyte areas followed by subsequent and rapid lymphocytic depletion, most likely through apoptotic mechanisms. Comparing changes to changes observed in the spleen suggests alterations in the lymph node lag behind those observed in the spleen. MARV animals inoculated with 1000 PFU had moderate fibrin deposition in the spleen, widespread intravascular coagulation was not observed, suggesting a significant difference in pathogenesis between the two agents (Fig. 3 and Table 4).",
