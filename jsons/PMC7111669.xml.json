It is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of nearly 25 kb, initially detected in pigs in Hong Kong, China in 2012 (Woo et al., 2012). The clinical significance of PDCoV has been highlighted since outbreaks of this virus, which causes severe diarrhea and mortality of piglets, occurred in multiple states of the United States in 2014 (Chen et al., 2015, Homwong et al., 2016, Hu et al., 2015, Hu et al., 2016, Jung et al., 2015, Ma et al., 2015, Marthaler et al., 2014, Thachil et al., 2015). Subsequently, reports of PDCoV in China, South Korea and Canada have caused considerable attention to be paid to the strategy employed by this emerging coronavirus to manipulate the host immune response (Dong et al., 2015, Lee et al., 2016).",

Through the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors, such as cytoplasmic RIG-I and MDA5, adapter molecules such as IPS-1 can be recruited and subsequently transfer the signal to the IKK\u03b1, IKK\u03b2, IKK\u03b3 (also called NF-\u03baB essential modulator (NEMO)), TBK1 and IKK-\u03b5. As an essential adapter, NEMO is responsible for the recruitment of TBK1 and IKK\u03b5 and the activation of IKK complex, leading to the triggering and transportation of NF-\u03baB and IRF3 to the nucleus, both of which induce downstream IFN-\u03b2 production (Kawai and Akira, 2006, Loo and Gale, 2011, Ramos and Gale, 2011, Seth et al., 2005, Yoneyama and Fujita, 2009).",

            "text": "Notably, recent studies have demonstrated that several viral proteins encoded by coronaviruses (CoV), such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV and mouse hepatitis virus, can modulate innate antiviral signaling (Li et al., 2016, Lui et al., 2016, Thornbrough et al., 2016). Relying on its proteinase activity, CoV non-structural protein 5 (nsp5), also called 3C-like protease or main protease, is responsible for processing the viral polyprotein to produce most of the non-structural proteins during viral replication (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, Masters, 2006, Perlman and Netland, 2009, Ziebuhr et al., 2000). The 3C-like protease of the Arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and the 3 C proteases of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), both of which belong to the Picornaviridae family, are reported to impair innate immune signaling (Huang et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2014). A study published by our lab also demonstrated that nsp5, the 3C-like protease of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which is classified into the Alphacoronavirus family, antagonizes IFN-\u03b2 production by cleavage of NEMO (Wang et al., 2016). Recently, our research has shown that infection with PDCoV inhibits RIG-I-mediated IFN signaling, although the specific inhibition mechanism remains poorly understood (Luo et al., 2016). As such, we were extremely interested to discover whether nsp5 of PDCoV could disrupt type I IFN signaling.",

Firstly, the cytotoxicity of PDCoV nsp5 in transiently transfected PK-15 and HEK-293T cells was evaluated using the methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. As shown in\nFig. 1A and Fig. 1B, no detectable cytotoxicity could be observed in cells transfected with nsp5 expression plasmid equal to or less than 1.0 \u03bcg in 24-well cell culture plates. Further, the data presented in Fig. 1C and D revealed that nsp5 exhibited strong inhibition of SEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity in both cell types. The SEV-induced IFN-\u03b2 protein in the supernatant was also strongly decreased under the ectopic expression of PDCoV nsp5 in HEK-293T cells (Fig. 1E). Moreover, nsp5 inhibited the activity of both IRF3 and NF-\u03baB-dependent promoters in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1F and G).

            "text": "To verify at which point in the signaling cascade nsp5 facilitated its inhibitory role, we assessed several crucial molecules in the MDA5/RIG-I signaling pathway, which play an important role in induction of IFN-\u03b2 production (Yoneyama and Fujita, 2007), including RIG-I, MDA5, IPS-1, NEMO, and TBK1. Similar to previous studies, overexpression of these crucial molecules significantly activated the IFN-\u03b2 promoter compared with cells transfected with the empty vector control (Siu et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2016). However, PDCoV nsp5 notably impaired the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter upon stimulation by RIG-I, MDA5, IPS-1 and NEMO. In contrast, TBK1-induced activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter was not affected by nsp5 (\nFig. 3A), suggesting that PDCoV nsp5 inhibits RIG-I/MDA5 signaling by targeting NEMO or other upstream proteins. Due to the indispensable role of PDCoV nsp5 protease activity in IFN-\u03b2 antagonism, we speculated that PDCoV nsp5 cleaved NEMO or an upstream molecule to impair type I IFN signaling. Thus, RIG-I, MDA5, IPS-1 or NEMO were co-transfected with nsp5 into HEK-293T cells. Western blotting showed a smaller band (~24 kDa) in the NEMO/PDCoV nsp5 co-expression samples, while no similar cleavage products were detected with RIG-I, MDA5 or IPS-1 co-transfections (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the cleavage of NEMO increased gradually with increasing transfection dose of PDCoV nsp5 (Fig. 3C) and the cleaved product could not be observed following transfection with the nsp5 C144A mutant lacking protease activity (Fig. 3D). These data indicate that PDCoV nsp5, relying on its protease activity, targets the essential molecule NEMO for cleavage.",

As such, we examined the P1 position residue of NEMO recognized by PDCoV nsp5. Considering the 24 kDa molecular weight of the cleaved product (N-terminal), a series of NEMO mutants were constructed between amino acids 210 and 263 (\nFig. 4A). The WT or mutated NEMO proteins were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells with PDCoV nsp5. The results indicated that Q218A, Q236A/Q239A or Q259A mutations were cleaved by PDCoV nsp5 normally, while Q229A or Q231A mutations was resistant to cleavage (Fig. 4B). As previously found, the common substrate preference of CoV nsp5 consists of leucine (L) at the P2 position and glutamine, lysine (K) or isoleucine (I), all of which contain a long side-chain and positive charge, at the P3 position (Chuck et al., 2010, Chuck et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2016). We speculated that if Q231 is the P1 residue, then the recognition and cleavage of Q231 by PDCoV nsp5 could be affected by a Q229A mutation (Fig. 4C). Therefore, two Q229 mutants at the speculated P3 position were substituted with lysine or arginine (R) which also has a long side-chain and positive charge. Evidently, Q229K and Q229R mutation can be cleaved to produce the same cleavage product as WT NEMO (Fig. 4D), revealing that Q231, but not Q229, is the P1 position residue cleaved by PDCoV nsp5. Docking studies between CoV nsp5 and substrate showed that through van der Waals interactions, the side chain of P3 residues could interact with the side chain of glutamic acid at residue 164 (Xue et al., 2008). The homology model for PEDV nsp5 and the NEMO peptide substrate also illustrated that a long side chain in the P3 position strongly supported nsp5\u2013substrate recognition (Wang et al., 2016). These studies provide important clues for the PDCoV nsp5\u2013NEMO interaction and give a possible explanation for the finding that mutant Q229A, but not Q229K or Q229R, significantly impaired cleavage by PDCoV nsp5.",

The K277A mutation has the same cleavage site as WT NEMO, with the PDCoV nsp5 P1 recognition site also being Q231 (\nFig. 5A). Hence, the IFN-\u03b2 promoter activated by NEMO-K277A, was suppressed by PDCoV nsp5 in a dose-dependent manner and this suppression was lost upon the expression of the protease-defective nsp5 C144A mutant (Fig. 5B and C).",

Quantitative PCR showed that mRNA levels of immune-related molecules, such as ISG54, ISG56, MX1, OAS1, and RANTES, were not successfully induced by the cleaved fragments of 1\u2013231 or 232\u2013419 (Fig. 5D). A previous study of PEDV nsp5 showed that cleavage fragments of NEMO did not activate IFN-\u03b2, IRF3 or NF-\u03baB-dependent promoters (Wang et al., 2016). As the cleavage site Q231 is identical for both PEDV and PDCoV nsp5, these results together demonstrate that PDCoV nsp5-induced cleavage fragments lack the capacity to activate the type I IFN response and downstream signaling, revealing that the role of NEMO in type I IFN signaling can be significantly inhibited following cleavage by PDCoV nsp5.",

In particular, the conserved Q231 residue recognized by both PDCoV nsp5 and PEDV nsp5 prompted us to speculate that the same IFN antagonistic mechanism may be common to members of the Coronaviridae family. It is worth investigating whether nsp5 from different CoV genera, including Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronaviruses, retain the ability to cleave NEMO and comparing this property between the different CoV genera.",
