Few studies have systematically investigated how these parameters affect the effectiveness of UV irradiation. Nerandzic et al studied 2 UV room disinfection devices (Tru-D [Tru-D SmartUVC, Memphis, TN] and PATHOGON\u00ae [STERIS, Mentor, OH]) and reported the following: (1) pathogen concentration did not significantly impact the killing efficacy of the devices; (2) both a heavy and light organic load had a significant negative impact on the killing efficacy of the devices; and (3) increasing the distance to ~3.05 m from the devices reduced the killing efficacy to \u22643 log10 colony forming units/cm2 for MRSA and VRE and <2 log10 colony forming units/cm2 for C difficile spores.25 Cadnum et al studied how various parameters affected the effectiveness of a UV-C device (Optimum-UV\u2122, Clorox, Oakland, CA) and reported the following: (1) spreading the inoculum over a greater surface area significantly enhanced killing of MRSA and C difficile; (2) orientation of the carrier disks in parallel rather than perpendicular with the UV-C enhanced killing; (3) presence of an organic load also impacted the measured efficacy of UV-C under certain test conditions; (4) use of plastic, formica, and glass slides resulted in similar killing when compared with steel carrier disks, provided manual spreading was used; and (5) heights from floor level to 6 ft did not affect killing at 1.83 m using Optimum.26\n",

There appears to be substantial consistency across many studies regarding the effectiveness of UV-C; however, most studies have used the same device (ie, Tru-D), and only a few of the UV devices commercially available have actually been studied. The time needed to inactivate pathogens has been demonstrated to be shortened by use of UV reflective wall paint for multiple different UV-C devices.30, 32\n",

Both devices achieved >4 log10 inactivation for when carriers were placed in direct line of site. For C difficile, both devices achieved a statistically similar kill; however, the duration of exposure was different (approximately 43 minutes for Tru-D and 10 minutes for Optimum). Cadnum et al studied the effectiveness of 2 UV-C devices (Tru-D and Optimum) to kill MRSA and C difficile and reported there was no difference in log10 pathogen reductions on experimentally contaminated steel carrier disks irradiated at ~1.22 m between the 2 devices. For MRSA, a >3 log10 reduction was achieved with 5-minute exposure, whereas for C difficile increasing exposure led to increasing kill (20-minute exposure required to achieve a reduction of approximately 2 log10).26\n",

Similarly, hydrogen peroxide systems differ with regard to concentration, use of other microbicides, method of injecting hydrogen peroxide into a room or space, and cost. For these reasons, infection control professionals should review the peer-reviewed literature and choose for purchase only devices with demonstrated bactericidal capability as assessed by the carrier test method or ability to disinfect actual patient rooms. Ultimately, one should choose only devices that have demonstrated the ability to reduce HAIs.",

Both systems are residual free. The major disadvantage of both systems is that they may only be used for terminal disinfection. Neither system will physically clean a room (eg, remove dust or stains), hence room cleaning must precede disinfection. Other differences include the following: (1) UV systems require a shorter delivery time; (2) UV systems can only inactivate pathogens in direct or indirect line of site (ie, they may not effectively decontaminate all surfaces in adjacent rooms, such as bathrooms); (3) hydrogen peroxide systems require that the HVAC system be sealed; and (4) hydrogen peroxide systems have demonstrated greater kill against spore-forming organisms (although the clinical impact requires further studies).",

Randomized clinical trials would also allow calculation of the cost-effectiveness of these devices. However, logistic and cost reasons are likely to preclude randomized clinical trials. Rather, decisions on use of these devices will need to be based on consistent demonstration of effectiveness in killing pathogens as previously detailed and quasi-experimental studies.",
