            "text": "At the 2000 European Association of Zoo and Wildlife Veterinarians (EAZWV) Congress in Paris, the establishment of an Infectious Diseases Working Group (IDWG) within the EAZWV was proposed. In North America, the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians (AAZV) already had an Infectious Disease Committee since the early 1990s. In Europe, this idea for a similar committee emerged when the problems of diagnosing and handling paratuberculosis were discussed in a presentation. It was obvious that commonly agreed recommendations were urgently needed for improved control of the infectious diseases that threatened the European collections. Also, as Europe was becoming more unified, it was necessary to deal with European politics and legislation via international collaboration. The idea to produce a comprehensive document containing disease fact sheets, legislation, laboratories, identifiable diseases, and so on resulted in the IDWG, which led to the production of the first edition of The Transmissible Diseases Handbook in May 2002 under the EAZWV-IDWG umbrella4 (Figure 68-1\n).",

            "text": "The foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in Europe in 2001 clearly underlined the importance of this initiative and made agreement on European standards a matter of even greater urgency. During this outbreak, the difficulties in controlling diseases in domesticated animals was realized; public opinion, politics, money, limited knowledge of the disease, and lack of agreement on legislation all contributed to this situation. It became obvious that even more misunderstandings would arise when dealing with such diseases in lesser-studied animals, including nondomestic species. In 2006, the highly pathogenic avian influenza spread across Europe and threatened zoo collections. Outbreaks of classic swine fever also occurred. Additionally, blue tongue disease created serious problems in transporting hoof stock and thus jeopardized organized programs for breeding endangered species.5 African swine fever, West Nile virus (WNV), African horse sickness, and monkeypox also threatened zoologic collections. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic (related to an animal coronavirus) confirmed these points and led to the recognition of the importance of The Transmissible Diseases Handbook. The second edition of the Handbook was published in 2004, the third edition in 2006, and the fourth edition in 2010; these updates were necessary because of the changes in threatening diseases, the changes in legislation, and the needs and demands for information expressed by its readers.2, 3, 4, 6 European laws (e.g., the Balai Directive1) are still under discussion and in development. Differing opinions (e.g., whether or not to vaccinate against FMD and avian influenza), various levels of veterinary faculties and laboratories, and thus differences in the rates of successful diagnoses, pose further problems for European zoo veterinarians. Since The Transmissible Diseases Handbook is a living document and because of all these changes a fifth edition will be produced in 2014.",

This committee already has its own Infectious Disease Reviews Notebook published in the early 1990s. This Notebook contained loose leaf handouts, with descriptions of various diseases important for zoo veterinarians and fact sheets on the diagnostics of important diseases such as tuberculosis. After the second edition of the EAZWV-IDWG Transmissible Diseases Handbook was published in May 2004, Dr. Julie Napier, a member of the AAZV and the chair of the IDC at the time, proposed creating a handbook for infectious diseases affecting nondomestic species and wildlife in North America, using the European version as a template (see Figure 68-1).",

It was the intent of the IDC that the formatting of its manual would include more in-depth information, including etiologies, clinical signs, and treatment protocols for diseases relevant to the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Following discussions on providing a similar tool for North American veterinarians, it was agreed that the IDC could use the European disease fact sheet as a template, which provided a standardized and unified format. Thanks to the hard work of many people under the leadership of Dr. Julie Napier and Dr. Kathryn Gamble, The first American edition was published in 2011, titled Infectious Disease Manual 2011, with the subtitle \u201cInfectious Diseases of Concern to Captive and Free-Ranging Wildlife in North America\u201d (Boxes 68-1\nand 68-2\n).

This significantly reduced the costs of production and distribution. Another advantage was the ability to increase the contents, without concerns about number of pages (the second edition was already 662 pages long!). Thus, the third and fourth editions contain more information on legislation and other new topics, thus a lot more pages. A printed version would have become too big and cost-prohibitive in terms of production and distribution. It was also hoped that this format would allow easier global access, which turned out to be the case. The fourth edition, like the previous editions, was distributed to all EAZWV members, all EAZA zoos, Central Veterinary Officers of the 27 EU Member States, the OIE, and the SANCO in Brussels. Another advantage of the book on a CD-ROM is the facility to search and have quick access to chapters and fact sheets (see Figure 68-2).",
