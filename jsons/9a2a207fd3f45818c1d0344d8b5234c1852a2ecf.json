The purpose of this article is to share our local experience of stepping up infection control measures in ophthalmology to minimise COVID-19 infection of both healthcare workers and patients. Methods Infection control measures implemented in our ophthalmology clinic are discussed. The measures are based on detailed risk assessment by both local ophthalmologists and infection control experts. Results A three-level hierarchy of control measures was adopted. First, for administrative control, in order to lower patient attendance, text messages with an enquiry phone number were sent to patients to reschedule appointments or arrange drug refill. In order to minimise cross-infection of COVID-19, a triage system was set up to identify patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, acute conjunctivitis or recent travel to outbreak areas and to encourage these individuals to postpone their appointments for at least 14 days. Micro-aerosol generating procedures, such as noncontact tonometry and operations under general anaesthesia were avoided. Nasal endoscopy was avoided as it may provoke sneezing and cause generation of droplets. All elective clinical services were suspended. Infection control training was provided to all clinical staff. Second, for environmental control, to reduce droplet transmission of COVID-19, installation of protective shields on slit lamps, frequent disinfection of equipment, and provision of eye protection to staff were implemented. All staff were advised to measure their own body temperatures before work and promptly report any symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, vomiting or diarrhoea. Third, universal masking, hand hygiene, and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) were promoted. Conclusion We hope our initial experience in stepping up infection control measures for COVID-19 infection in ophthalmology can help ophthalmologists globally to prepare for the potential community outbreak or pandemic. In order to minimise transmission of COVID-19, ophthalmologists should work closely with local infection control teams to implement infection control measures that are appropriate for their own clinical settings.",

The name COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019, was proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] . The virus was officially named as 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2) [2] . The incubation period of COVID-19 falls within 2 to 14 days according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [3] , although the incubation period could be up to 24 days in rare cases [4] . Symptoms of the infection include fever, cough, fatigue, myalgia, dyspnoea and diarrhoea. Computed tomography scans showed patchy shadows or ground glass opacities in the lungs. Complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome, arrhythmia and shock, and the mortality rate was 2.3% according to a large-scale retrospective study [5] . SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has evolved into a global health threat within weeks. As of 27 February 2020, there were 82,294 confirmed cases involving 47 countries [6] . There were 92 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, including both imported and local cases [7] . This paper aims to share our local experience to help ophthalmologists globally to take necessary measures to minimise COVID-19 infection of both healthcare workers and patients.",

            "text": "According to the WHO, during previous coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS, human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contacts and fomites, suggesting that the mode of transmission of COVID-19 could be similar [8] . As of 14 February 2020, 1716 healthcare workers in China were infected with COVID-19 and six of them died [9] . One of them was Dr. Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital. In early January, he contracted COVID-19 from an asymptomatic glaucoma patient and succumbed to the disease one month later [10] . There were anecdotal reports suggesting that individuals may be infected by patients with subclinical infection [11] , either by droplets or by direct contact with secretions from infected cases followed by subsequent inoculation into mucous membranes. Anecdotal reports suggested that when no eye protection was worn, the virus could also possibly be transmitted by aerosol contact with conjunctiva and cause infection [12] [13] [14] . Hence the close proximity between ophthalmologists and patients during slit lamp examination and direct ophthalmoscopy may pose an infectious risk to ophthalmologists. Ophthalmologists may also be caught off guard as conjunctivitis, though uncommon, could be the first presenting symptom of COVID-19, before the appearance of other symptoms such as cough and fever [12, 13] . The American Academy of Ophthalmology has issued an alert advising ophthalmologists to wear masks and eye protection when seeing conjunctivitis patients with respiratory symptoms and history of international travel [14] . Moreover, in 2003, the SARS coronavirus was isolated from SARS patients' tear samples [15] and thus, it is possible that the novel coronavirus may also be present in tears of COVID-19 patients.",

We took advantage of short message service (SMS) to send information to patients via their electronic mobile devices, at least one week in advance before their scheduled appointments, providing them with an enquiry phone number so they could call to postpone their appointments and consider drug-refill if appropriate. Out of 1117 SMS sent out during the first week of February 2020, we had an encouraging response rate of 23.5% (262 responses). 24 .6% of patient attendance was reduced as a result.

Patients fulfilling the following criteria were also identified: (i) patients (or patients who have family members or accompanying persons) who travelled to outbreak areas within 14 days, (ii) patients with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, such as cough, and (iii) patients with acute conjunctivitis. If they fulfil any of the above criteria, their clinic appointments would be postponed for at least 14 days, which is current understanding of the incubation period of COVID-19 [3] . Any patient who fulfilled any of the above criteria but required urgent ophthalmic attention would be diverted to a separate waiting area and seen by a designated ophthalmologist in a special room. Dedicated equipment and instruments were used and not shared with the other consultation rooms. Figure 2 illustrates the patient triage workflow.",

Eye protection equipment such as visors or protective eyewear were provided to all ophthalmologists and surgical masks were worn by both ophthalmologists and patients. Ophthalmologist attending higher risk patients at designated areas took extra precautions and wore full personal protective equipment including isolation gown, gloves, cap, eye protection, and surgical mask (or N95 respirator when necessary).

Nevertheless, due to variations in outbreak severity and individual hospital settings in different localities, we suggest ophthalmologists to consult their local infection control experts for detailed risk assessment before deciding on the extent of infection control measures to be implemented in their own clinical settings.
