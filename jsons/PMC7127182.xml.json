            "text": "Influenza viruses are common and major pathogens that cause viral respiratory infections. These viruses are a serious threat to the health of people worldwide as the severe morbidity and mortality they cause. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), seasonal influenza viruses cause about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths each year. Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and are divided into four types: type A, B, C, and D [1]. Influenza A virus (IAV) is the most virulent of these pathogens. Based on two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), IAVs are further divided into many subtypes, also known as serotypes. So far, 18 serotypes of HA (H1\u2013H18) and 11 serotypes of NA (N1\u2013N11) have been described and verified [2]. Due to reassortment or mutation, IAV subtypes evolve constantly and can cause pandemics, with a recent example being the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus [3]. Among the IAV subtypes, H1N1 and H3N2 are the most common subtypes causing disease in humans around the world.",

However, approximately 33% of individuals infected are asymptomatic [7], and others infected by bacteria or other viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and rhinovirus, also show influenza-like signs and symptoms. Compared to laboratory diagnostic technology, clinical diagnosis is estimated to have an 18\u201387% positive predictive value [8]. In the laboratory, the long turnaround time of viral culture is unfavorable for accurate treatment and control of IAVs. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) are widely used to identify IAVs in healthcare services because they are simple and swift [[8], [9], [10]]. Although the specificity of RIDTs is up to 90%, the defect is an inconsistent sensitivity (10\u201380%) [8,9,11]. More recently, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [[12], [13], [14], [15]], real-time RT-PCR [16,17], and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) [18,19], have been used for rapid and sensitive diagnosis or subtyping of IAVs. Nevertheless, these methods require expensive equipment and/or skilled technicians, making them inappropriate for use in developing countries.",

Due to antigen drift and genetic variability of IAVs, many isolates are collected and identified in the influenza surveillance annually. This makes it difficult to align all the published sequences of IAVs. Consequently, we firstly classified the sequences in the database based on both the geographically country/region and collection date/release date (Influenza Virus Resource, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/FLU/Database/nph-select.cgi#mainform). Secondly, a consensus sequence was obtained by alignment of the sequences isolated from the same country within a five-year span. Finally, all the consensus sequences were aligned using the clustalW (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). The primers and nfo probes were designed according to the most conserved sequence, were synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China), and are shown in Table 2\nand Table S1. Each nfo Probe was modified with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) at the 5\u2032 end, an internal abasic nucleotide analogue (tetrahydrofuran, THF) and a 3\u2032-polymerase extension blocking group C3-spacer. Opposing to nfo probe, the primer was labeled with biotin at the 5\u2032 end.",

Overall, twenty-seven samples were positive for IAVs by matrix RT-RPA-LFD assay, while thirty-six samples were positive by matrix real-time RT-PCR. We further found that Ct values of nine discordant samples were greater than 37. Fourteen samples were H1-positive by RT-RPA-LFD, while fifteen samples were positive by real-time RT-PCR. Only one sample with a Ct value of 36.9 was negative by H1 RT-RPA-LFD assay. Additionally, four of fourteen H3-positive samples confirmed by real-time RT-PCR were negative by H3 RT-RPA-LFD assay. Ct values of four discordant samples were greater than 37. McNemar's test indicated that the difference between RT-RPA-LFD and real-time RT-PCR for distinguishing H1 and H3 subtypes is not significant (P > 0.05), but for detection of IAVs (P = 0.004). Agreement of RT-RPA-LFD and real-time RT-PCR was evaluated by kappa test.

Primers and nfo probe were designed according to the alignment of matrix gene sequences. During the past several decades, subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 have been circulating worldwide [28]. According to the latest influenza surveillance [29], H3N2 and A(H1N1)pdm09 accounted for the majority of circulating viruses. Therefore, we designed another two assays for subtyping H1 and H3, thus providing a rapid and convenient method for subtyping of H1 and H3.",

The negative result of RIDTs does not rule out influenza infection, particularly in the season of high influenza activity. When a negative result of RIDT is inconsistent with clinical signs and symptoms, RT-RPA-LFD assays can be used as an effective supplement for IAV diagnosis.

            "text": "Although it is relatively rapid, specific and sensitive for diagnosis of IAVs and subtyping of H1/H3 by RT-RPA-LFD assays, there are two major drawbacks for these assays. One is that reverse transcription and RPA are two separate reactions. To further simplify the process, one-step RT-RPA was performed in a single tube containing TwistDx nfo kit (TwistDX, Cambridge, UK), reverse transcriptase XL (AMV, Takara, Dalian, China) and RNase Inhibitor (Takara, Dalian, China), and used to detect IAV and discriminate H1 and H3. Compared to two-step RT-RPA, the performance of one-step RT-RPA is unsatisfactory. This is probably because that there exists an inhibitory effect between the biotin-labeled reverse primer and reverse transcriptase, or between RT and RPA. This needs to try different strategies to make RT and RPA harmoniously run in a single tube. The other is that exists potential amplicons contamination. RPA product was pipetted to LFD for analysis by opening the reaction tube, which can cause amplicon contamination. This is a very prominent concern for quality control of these assays, especially which are used in a small hospital or rural areas with untrained staff. Previous studies indicate that Uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG) and dUTP can effectively eliminate amplicon contamination in PCR [31,32] or LAMP [33]. It is possible that the elimination of RPA amplicon contamination uses UNG and dUTP. Importantly, many sealed devices are developed for analysis of RPA product, and this can also avoid amplicon contamination [[34], [35], [36], [37]]. Therefore, the combination of RPA, UNG/dUTP, and/or a sealed LF device to reduce amplicon contamination will be performed in the future. Cost of the test per sample is approximately $2.5 (RT, $0.5; RPA reaction, $1.5; LFD, $0.5). A 25-\u03bcl reaction system and LFD assembled by ourselves greatly reduce the cost of test. With the improvement of availability and throughput, cost of RT-RPA-LFD will decrease in the further. For example, multiplexed recombinase polymerase amplification assay has been developed to detect intestinal protozoa reducing the cost of a lateral flow strip to $1 [26]. Furthermore, using LFDs can effectively save the cost of fluorescent detectors.",
