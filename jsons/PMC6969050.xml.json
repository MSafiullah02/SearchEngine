            "text": "Diphtheria is an infectious disease and caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The bacterium primarily infects the throat and upper airways but can also affect other body sites. The produced toxin can spread through the bloodstream and affect organs, such as the heart and kidneys. In severe cases, diphtheria toxin (DT) may cause myocarditis or peripheral neuropathy. Due to a membrane of dead tissue over the throat and tonsils, swallowing and breathing can be difficult. The disease is spread through direct physical contact or by coughing or sneezing of infected individuals1\u20133. Diphtheria is fatal in 5\u201310% of cases, but children under the age of five have a mortality rate of up to 20%. Treatment involves antibiotics to kill the bacteria (erythromycin or penicillin for 14 days) and administering of diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) to neutralize the effects of the toxin4\u20136. C. diphtheriae was identified as the causative agent of diphtheria in 1883 and in 1888 the diphtheria toxin was first described in the culture medium of C. diphtheriae7. The gene for DT is encoded on a corynebacteriophage8,9 and the toxin is secreted as a single polypeptide chain of 535 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 58 kDa10,11. Mild trypsinization and reduction of DT in vitro generates two fragments, A and B, which remain covalently attached by an inter-chain disulfide bond12. Fragment A contains the enzymatic activity, whereas fragment B binds the protein to the cell surface receptors and promotes translocation of fragment A to the cytoplasm13,14. DT is composed of three structural domains: the catalytic domain (C) corresponds to fragment A (21 kDa) while the transmembrane (T) domain (20 kDa) and receptor binding (R) domain (17 kDa) comprise fragment B (37 kDa) (Fig. 1)15. Diphtheria toxin binds with the receptor binding domain to heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) on the cell surface of susceptible cells. This binding triggers receptor-mediated endocytosis of the toxin and the acidic conditions in the endosome lead to a conformational change and the translocation domain of DT to form a channel through the endosomal membrane to transport the C-domain to the cytosol16\u201318. In the cytosol, the C-domain catalyzes the NAD+ -dependent ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor 2 (EF-2) of the ribosome resulting in an inactivation of the protein synthesis and cell death by apoptosis19,20.",

            "text": "In 1890, Emil von Behring and Shibasabur\u014d Kitasato found that the serum of immunized animals is protective against DT21. This serum therapy was a breakthrough for the treatment of diphtheria, especially for children, and was awarded with the first Nobel Prize for medicine in 1901. Despite the introduction of effective vaccination programmes against diphtheria, gaps in immunization coverage still exist, meaning that diphtheria remains endemic in some areas. Even in populations with good immunization coverage, isolated cases still occur. In recent years, significant diphtheria outbreaks have occurred in countries or regions with a collapsed health system because of political instability or civil war, e.g. Yemen, Venezuela or the Rohingya refugee camps in Cox\u2019s Bazar (Bangladesh), resulting in failed vaccinations of children22\u201325. In all clinical cases, the primary therapeutic option is still treatment with diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) produced by hyper-immunization of horses.",

            "text": "Production of therapeutic antibodies in horses raises ethical issues surrounding the use of animals, especially by substandard housing and veterinary care of the horses, and there are strict requirements for ensuring freedom from adventitious agents. Equine hyperimmune sera contain a large and varied amount of different antibodies with unknown specificity and, because of the nature of the product, there is potential for variations in quality between different batches. The human immune system may develop antibodies against foreign antigens introduced from administration of the animal sera, which leads to the formation of immune complexes, which can precipitate in joints or small vessels, activating the complement cascade and initiating a systematic and potentially serious inflammatory response, a condition known as serum sickness26\u201328. Today, DAT is in scarce supply and frequently unavailable to patients because of discontinued production in several countries29. There is an urgent need for an alternative to replace the equine DAT, therefore, new treatment options with recombinant fully human antibodies are desirable. Recombinant human antibodies are sequence defined, produced in cell culture and as they are human proteins, serum sickness can be avoided. These advantages of recombinant antibodies make them ideal therapeutics against pathogens and toxins30,31.",

            "text": "The most common technology to generate recombinant human therapeutic antibodies is antibody phage display32. Antibody phage display allows the selection of antibody fragments, mainly single chain fragment variable (scFv) or fragment antigen binding (Fab), directly from human antibody gene libraries in vitro. In brief, antibody fragments are displayed on the surface of filamentous M13 phage particles by linking the antibody to the phage protein III. The corresponding antibody gene fragment is encoded on a phagemid packaged in the phage particles so that, phenotype and genotype are coupled. In a selection process called \u201cpanning\u201d, antibody phage particles are incubated with the antigen, non-binding phage particles are washed away and the binding antibody phage particles are eluted. This process is repeated 2\u20133 times. Subsequently, monoclonal antibodies are produced and screened for antigen binding, e.g. ELISA on antigen, or in functional assays, e.g. neutralization assays33\u201336. Because the gene encoding the antibody fragment is directly accessible, the antibodies can be converted into other antibody formats such as scFv-Fc or IgG, for further experiments and applications37,38. Antibody phage display is a well validated tool to generate recombinant antibodies against toxins for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes39\u201344. An overview of antibodies generated by phage display against pathogens and toxins is given by Kuhn et al.31. An overview on phage display derived therapeutic antibodies is given by Frenzel et al.32.",

Two immune antibody gene libraries were constructed. For the first library, the total PBMCs were used and the RNA was isolated resulting in 10.5 \u00b5g total RNA used for cDNA synthesis. The cDNAs derived from the blood of each person was kept separated in the construction process of the total PBMC library and the final sublibraries were combined. This first immune library was called VJN library. For the second library, the freshly prepared PBMCs were stained with a florescence conjugated CD138+ antibody to detect the antibody-producing B cells. In the next step, the stained cells were selected by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). 8.8 \u00d7 107 PBMCs were sorted, resulting in the isolation of 2,501 CD138+ cells ( = 0.003%).

The library quality and the coverage of the complete DT gene was analyzed by sequencing of approximately 80 clones (Supplementary Fig. 1) showing a nearly complete coverage of DT using this limited amount of sequences. We expected to get also overlapping C-T fragments and were surprised to get the most fragments at the beginning of the C or T domain. Subsequently, a panning was performed on 34 of the 35 best neutralizing antibodies in the scFv-Fc format using the A- and the B-fragment libraries separately. We excluded ewe191-C10 because this antibody lost neutralization capacity after conversion to the IgG format. Individual epitope phage clones from the second panning round were screened by ELISA. For 19 antibodies, the minimal epitope region (MER) was identified (Table 4). An overview of all identified MERs is given in Fig. 8 and the detailed sequencing results for each identified MER are given in Supplementary Fig. 2A\u2013S. For two antibodies no binding partners were identified in the screening ELISA. For 13 antibodies the data were inconclusive because DT fragments of two epitope regions were selected and identified in the screening ELISA (e.g. for ewe192-F11 in Supplementary Fig. 2T), or clones from one epitope region were identified but, in addition, more than one outlier in other DT regions or inverse clones were selected. For ewe372-H1-S, the outlier may be excluded because of the results derived from ewe372-H1-W which differs only by one amino acid in framework one. The length of the identified MERs ranged from 14 amino acids for ewe192-D8 to the complete C-domain for ewe372-D11 ewe374-H4.

The amount of toxin needed to cause more than 50% cell death in the presence of a fixed, defined amount of reference DAT is given as the limit of cytopathic dose (Lcd). The Lcd number refers to the inverse of the antitoxin concentration in IU. Hence, Lcd/1 is the amount of toxin per mL causing >50% cell death in the presence of 1 IU DAT, Lcd/10 for 0.1 IU DAT, and so forth. In our assay, Lcd/1000 equates to approximately 40 \u00d7 MCD. In addition, neutralization using 4 \u00d7 MCD was measured in parallel again for direct comparison. The sensitivity of cells to DT is given as multiple of the minimum cytopathic dose (MCD) \u2013 so the assay performed at 4 \u00d7 MCD uses a fixed DT concentration that is 4 \u00d7 higher than the minimum concentration causing >50% cell death. The results for individual antibodies and antibody combinations are given in Table 6. The results for the neutralization assay using 4 \u00d7 MCD are, as expected, in the same range as the results given in Table 2. There was no loss of potency when using Lcd/1000 (~40 \u00d7 MCD), but the individual antibodies lost neutralization capacity at higher DT dose levels of Lcd/100 or Lcd/10.

In order to improve the throughput, for the clones enriched by panning in solution, a functional screening on DT neutralization was performed to directly identify neutralizing antibodies, instead of identification of binding followed by neutralization. The observed V-gene distribution of the DT neutralizing antibodies matched the distribution of V-genes from naive antibody gene libraries57 with the exception VH4-34. This V-gene is rarely selected from phage display libraries (based on our in-house data from >3500 phage display selected and validated scFv) but is common in the natural human antibody repertoire58.

The antibodies were initially analyzed in the scFv-Fc format because the conversion from scFv to scFv-Fc is only one cloning step61. For further in vitro and in vivo assays, 35 selected antibodies were converted to the IgG format because IgGs are the preferred format for therapeutic antibodies54. Here, differences in the EC50 between the scFv-Fc format and IgG were measured. A few antibodies lost affinity by cloning from scFv to IgG format, possibly due to different folding or the reduced flexibility of the angle between VH and VL in the Fab/IgG compared to the scFv format because of the stabilization by CH1+ CL37,62,63. Conversely, the affinity was improved for the antibody ewe192-D8 whose initially weak EC50 increased by around 10-fold following conversion to IgG. The EC50 values determined by MST differed to that measured in ELISA by a factor of ~100. In ELISA the analyzed antibodies had an EC50 value of under 1 nM.

For two of the analyzed antibodies, the complete C-domain was selected by phage display, indicating that the epitope is not linear. Interestingly, these two antibodies bound the C-domain in western blot after SDS-PAGE, indicating sufficient refolding of the C-domain on the PVDF membrane. In the case of ewe192-H8, domain mapping revealed that only the B-fragment was the antibody target and not a specific domain within that fragment of DT. However, using the phage display approach the T-domain of the B-fragment was identified showing that the conformation of the recognized MER may depend on the formation of T- and R-domains. It was demonstrated that all three DT domains are targets of highly neutralizing recombinant antibodies which is in accordance with previous publications showing that neutralizing human recombinant antibodies70,71 or murine monoclonal antibodies72 can target all three domains.",

This assay is performed at a higher toxin dose (referred to as Lr/100) than that used in the routine Vero cell TNT. Surprisingly, we found that individual antibodies did not neutralize DT even when the antibody dose was increased. In this assay, the specific activity was at least 500-fold lower compared to that measured in the Vero cell TNT at 4 \u00d7 MCD. These findings were confirmed by performing the Vero cell TNT at higher toxin dose levels. An equine polyclonal DAT included as a comparator in all Vero cell TNT assays had a similar neutralizing potency at all toxin dose levels used. When the monoclonal antibodies were tested in combination \u2013 either as a pair or a trio - excellent neutralization of DT was observed in vivo (at Lr/100) and in vitro (at Lcd/100 and Lcd/10). The specific activity of the antibody combinations was determined to be approximately 80 IU/mg in vivo and 80\u2013160 IU/mg in vitro. At the low toxin dose level of 4 \u00d7 MCD in Vero cells, we did not observe any synergistic effect of combining more than one antibody. We hypothesize that the mode of action is not only based on neutralization, but also on the formation of aggregates as described by Heidelberger and Kendall74. This mode of action was also described for other recombinant antibodies which bind more than one epitope on the targeted toxin, e.g. for the anti-TcdA antibody Actotoxumab binding to a repeating epitope structure on the toxin75 or bispecific VHH antibody constructs against the plant toxin ricin76,77. For the antibody 315C4 an in vivo neutralization potency using a lethal guinea pig challenge assay of 64 IU/mg was published70. Further in vivo tests were performed for the antibody S315 which is derived from 315C4, resulting in a neutralization potency which corresponds to 58.8 IU/mg78. An in vivo neutralization potency of 73.6 IU/mg were published by Kakita et al.71 for DTD4 using a rabbit skin test as in vivo model. Despite differences in the models used, our results suggest that the neutralizing potency of the antibody combinations tested in our study is comparable and likely superior to the results obtained for single monoclonal antibodies developed elsewhere.",

The use of blood samples for the amplification of antibody gene fragments to develop antibody phage display libraries was approved by the ethical committee of the Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig (Ethik-Kommission der Fakult\u00e4t 2 der TU Braunschweig, approval number DM-2014-08). The donors have given their consent for study publication. The library construction was performed as described previously with minor modifications79. In brief, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were extracted from the blood via Ficoll (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) and RNA isolated with Trizol and a Trizol RNA purification kit (Zymo Research, Freiburg, Germany). For the B-cell sorted library, B-cells were stained with mouse \u03b1-CD138 (FITC conjugated) antibody (ab27390, abcam, Cambridge, UK) and sorted via FACS and taken up in Trizol. In addition, the RNA of the sorted B cells was extracted using the Trizol RNA purification kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The RNA was converted into cDNA using Superscript III (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The cDNA was amplified with specific primers for the VH chain, primers for kappa light chain and primer for lambda light chain. These PCR products were again amplified with primers adding a restriction site for further cloning into the E. coli expression vector pHAL51. The vector pHAL51 is derived from the vector pHAL3057 with an AscI stuffer in the VL cloning site. Firstly, the light chain was cloned with the restriction sites MluI and NotI, and secondly the VH chain was cloned with the restriction sites HindIII and NcoI. The efficiency of library cloning was tested with a colony PCR and the rate of complete scFv were determined.

Husbandry conditions were a 12 h light, 12 h dark cycle, including \u2018dawn and dusk\u2019 half-light periods of 30 minutes each. Temperature was maintained between 16\u201323 degrees Celsius. A pelleted diet (\u2018FD1\u2019 supplied by LBS), filtered mains water (bottle and bowl) and autoclaved hay were all provided ad libitum. Washed fresh greens were provided 3 times weekly. Environmental enrichment including plastic and/or cardboard boxes, tunnels and shelters, and nesting material were also provided in each pen. Animals were health checked at least once per day as stock, and up to 3 times daily whilst on test by trained and competent technical staff, with attention to the size and degree of erythema at the injection sites and the general condition and behaviour of the animals.",

A series of 6 dilutions of antibody sample (either individually or as a combination) were mixed with a fixed volume of DT (EDQM Biological Reference Preparation, batch 1) at a DT dose level of Lr/100. The Lr/100 dose level for this toxin was pre-determined by titration against 0.01 IU/ml of a reference antitoxin (WHO International Standard for Diphtheria Antitoxin Equine, NIBSC code 17/230). A series of 6 dilutions of the reference antitoxin were also prepared and mixed with the same amount of DT in parallel to allow for determination of relative potency. Samples were allowed to stand at RT for 30\u201340 minutes prior to intradermal injection (0.2 mL) into the shaved flank of a guinea pig. A group of 2 animals was used for each antibody sample (or combination) or the reference antitoxin with 3 dilutions injected per flank. For each sample, the largest volume of antitoxin failing to protect guinea pigs from the local erythematous effect of DT was defined as the end point and potency was determined relative to the end point for the reference antitoxin, after taking into account total dilution factor for the sample.",
