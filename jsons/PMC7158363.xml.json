The leukogram does not normally document sepsis, identify specific causative agents, or pinpoint location of inflammation. However, characteristic changes in the leukogram identify presence of inflammatory disease and characterize its severity. Toxic changes and severity of inflammation may suggest sepsis, which may be confirmed and localized by cytology, microbiologic culture, serum chemistries, radiographs, ultrasonography, surgical biopsy, or serology. Any one or a combination of these tests may localize the disease process to a tissue or organ system or provide a definitive diagnosis.",

Leukocytes develop in the bone marrow from pluripotent and committed stem cells influenced by interleukins and colony-stimulating factors (Raskin, 1996). Pluripotent stem cells provide a reserve compartment for hematopoietic cell (i.e., leukocyte, erythrocyte, platelet) production if bone marrow has been severely damaged by toxins, drugs, infectious agents, or radiation (Figure 4-2\n). Pluripotent stem cells are found in both bone marrow and blood. They may affect repopulation of the bone marrow after a severe insult, provided proper stromal cells and growth factors are present. The number of pluripotent stem cells decreases with age, so younger animals generally have a better chance of restoring bone marrow function than do aged adults.",

Bone marrow is divided into two pools: The first, the mitotic pool of myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes, provides a steady supply of neutrophils to meet tissue demand for these cells. The second pool is maturation and storage, which consists of metamyelocytes, bands, and segmenters that lack mitotic ability. These cells undergo progressive maturation and provide a reserve of segs to meet increased tissue demands for neutrophils until the mitotic pool increases neutrophil production. The maturation and storage functions are combined in Figure 4-3. Neutrophil release from the bone marrow into the blood is age ordered according to maturity (segs, bands, metamyelocytes, myelocytes, and promyelocytes, in that order). As bone marrow stores of segs are depleted, nonsegmented neutrophils (nonsegs) (e.g., bands, metamyelocytes, younger neutrophils) are released into the blood, and a left shift occurs.",

Neutrophils (and other leukocytes) in the total leukocyte count are collected from the circulating pool, which encompasses the mainstream or central axial flow of blood within vessels. The marginal neutrophil pool is a \u201chidden\u201d population associated with the endothelial lining of capillaries, especially the lungs and spleen. As cells continually shift between these pools, the leukocyte count changes. In dogs, circulating and marginal pools are about equal. In cats, the marginal pool is two to three times the size of the circulating pool (Table 4-1\n).

Inflammation may also be suggested by the magnitude of leukocytosis (if it exceeds that expected with corticosteroid or epinephrine-associated conditions).

Bands usually constitute most of the left shift because release of neutrophils from bone marrow is an age-ordered process. Neutrophils younger than bands indicate an increasingly severe left shift associated with increasingly intense inflammation. Classification of immature neutrophils on blood smears is very subjective; therefore one should not overinterpret small changes from reference values or from day to day.

Individual animals will vary from this pattern in response to drug administration or to variations in disease intensity. The greatest left shift would be expected in early stages of the disease process. As the preexisting bone marrow maturation and storage pool is depleted of segs, then neutrophil bands and metamyelocytes are released. Over ensuing days, myeloid hyperplasia within the bone marrow expands neutrophil production. If neutrophil production and maturation time are sufficient, mainly mature cells are released into the blood and the severity of the left shift should diminish. If tissue inflammation stabilizes at a persistent low-to-moderate level, the bone marrow should reach a production rate sufficient for most neutrophils to mature before release. Thus chronic inflammation may be characterized by little to no left shift and minimal to absent leukocytosis. This form of chronic inflammation is the hardest to identify by CBC data alone.

In addition, neutrophils are shifted from the marginal pool (where they cannot be counted) to the circulating pool (where they are quantitated by the WBC count). A left shift is not expected with stress or corticosteroid treatment. Nuclear hypersegmentation of neutrophils (called a right shift) is more likely because corticosteroids decrease emigration of and prolong the circulating half-life of neutrophils in the blood (see Table 4-4). As neutrophils age, progressive nuclear hypersegmentation or lobulation develops. Hypersegmented neutrophils have five or more nuclear lobes. Corticosteroids also increase the bone marrow release rate of neutrophils, which is a major cause of the leukocytosis. However, this effect is usually too mild to stimulate release of bands and metamyelocytes in the presence of a normal bone marrow storage pool of neutrophils. A left shift indicates a depleted bone marrow storage pool of neutrophils and significant tissue demand for neutrophils secondary to concurrent inflammation.",

Because of a longer half-life of platelets and erythrocytes, numeric change in these elements is less noticeable than for neutrophils. Cyclic hematopoiesis, often with a more irregu- lar periodicity, also has been observed in other breeds of dogs, in rare cats with FeLV infection (Swenson et al, 1987), and after cyclophosphamide treatment of some dogs. Oscillations of neutrophils, other leukocytes, reticulocytes, and platelets occur at 8- to 29-day intervals.",

Eosinophils kill parasites by attaching to them and forming a digestive vacuole between the eosinophil and parasite. Eosinophils degranulate potent molecules such as major basic protein and eosinophil peroxidase, which damage the wall of the parasite or ova. More intense eosinophilic response occurs with parasites within tissues (e.g., heartworms, strongyles, migrating lung flukes such as Paragonimus kellicotti). Endoparasites, such as Giardia species or tapeworms that do not invade tissue generally do not incite eosinophilia. Some parasites may not stimulate eosinophilia until they die and expose previously hidden antigens. Production of eosinophilia is an immune response. The first exposure to a parasite produces a modest, delayed eosinophilia. The second exposure to the same parasite results in an intense, dramatic eosinophilia.",

The following information is for those choosing to treat leukemic cases and who need a more specific diagnosis for treatment choices. Definitive diagnosis of specific leukemias usually requires a veterinary clinical pathologist. Slide review from routine CBC with Wright's-stained smears of EDTA anticoagulated blood may allow differentiation of the cellular origin, such as lymphoid from myeloid (i.e., nonlymphoid). Evaluation of the bone marrow is often necessary to classify the leukemia, because the blood may not be representative of the degree of leukemic involvement. If cell morphology in a leukemic patient is insufficient to determine the cell lineage, one may use specialized tests (i.e., cytochemistry, electron microscopy, immunocytochemistry) usually conducted at academic institutions or refer- ral laboratories. Cytochemistry involves nonimmunologic cytoplasmic markers for enzymes, lipids, or glycogen within the cell (Raskin and Valenciano, 2000). Enzymes include peroxidase found in certain granulocytes and nonspecific esterases found in monocytes or T lymphocytes (see Table 4-7\n). Electron microscopy is helpful to study the ultrastructural features of the cytoplasm and nucleus (Grindem et al., 1985a, Grindem et al., 1985b). Immunocytochemistry involves staining of specific cell surface antigens by the use of antibodies such as monoclonal antibodies against CD3 (T cells), CD4 (helper cells), CD8 (cytotoxic or suppressor cells), CD14 (monocyte progenitors), CD21 (B cells), and CD79 (B cells) (Moore and Vernau, 2000). Blood and bone marrow specimens for these special procedures require specific instructions in handling, preparation, and fixation. Therefore the clinical pathologist should be consulted to avoid delay in diagnosis caused by improper sample or sample handling.",

This veterinary system separates lymphoid neoplasms by immunophenotype and tumor site location primarily supported by morphologic criteria and may provide better prognostic information than previous classification schemes. Histopathology plays a key role in using this system. The lymphoid leukemic forms are classified as acute or chronic. An abundance of blast cells or immature cells characterizes acute leukemia.

It occurs mostly in middle- to old-aged dogs (mean 10 years) with a higher frequency in females. Cats rarely have this form of leukemia; most are FeLV negative. Differentiation of CLL from ALL or lymphoma with a leukemic blood profile is based on the relatively mature appearance of lymphocytes in CLL versus finding lymphoblasts in the other conditions. Lymphocytes in CLL are larger than normal and more homogeneous in appearance than in normal animals. Diagnosis of CLL is aided greatly by magnitude of the lymphocytosis, which may exceed 40,000 to 100,000 lymphocytes/\u03bcl. Maximum lymphocytosis in extreme immune reactions (e.g., chronic canine rickettsial infections) seldom exceeds 25,000 lymphocytes/\u03bcl and usually is less than 15,000 lymphocytes/\u03bcl. Lymphocytosis in cats with strong persistent, immune stimulus in nonleukemic diseases may reach higher maximum lymphocyte counts (e.g., 40,000/\u03bcl). Reactive lymphocytosis in young, asymptomatic cynomolgus monkeys can reach 70,000 lymphocytes for 1 or 2 weeks. These extreme changes may be called a lymphocytic leukemoid reaction. CLL is the first entity to rule out when lymphocytosis exceeds 25,000 to 40,000 lymphocytes/\u03bcl. The likelihood of CLL increases proportionally to lymphocytosis; counts greater than 50,000 to 100,000/\u03bcl are particularly diagnostic.

Total leukocyte counts are variable, but extreme leukocytosis may occur. Blast cells are often found in circulation. Severe anemia and thrombocytopenia may accompany AML. Myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and atypical cells denote subtypes M1 to M3. Myeloblasts may have a moderately basophilic cytoplasm with few small azurophilic granules.

This ratio may fall between 4:1 to 25:1 or as high as 36:1. The bone marrow contains less than 30% myeloblasts of nonlymphohistiocytic cells (see Figure 4-9). Diagnosis of CGL is often based on finding marked, persistent leukocytosis (40,000 to 200,000/\u03bcl) and exclusion of a leukemoid reaction, discussed earlier under inflammatory leukocytosis. Anemia is mild-to-moderate and platelet counts are variable. Lymphadenopathy with lymph node aspirates that resemble marked extramedullary hematopoiesis may occur in CGL. The prognosis and response to treatment is better than for AML, with death occurring months after diagnosis because of a blast cell crisis.",

Definitive diagnosis of polycythemia vera requires ruling out other causes of erythrocytosis or absolute polycythemia (see Chapter 3).
