            "text": "Colchicine is an alkaloid which has been used for centuries for treating gout [1] . The source of its name is Colchis, a kingdom on the Black Sea in Western Georgia. Its history is related to Medea who was the daughter of Aeetes, ruler of Colchis. Aeetes kept the \"golden fleece\" under heavy guard. His daughter, Medea used to \"harvest grasses and to extract harmful juices squeezed from twisted roots\" [2] . Among the most potent products squeezed from these bulb-corms was the juice of Colchicum autumnale, the yellow crocus of Colchis. On his quest to fetch the \"golden fleece\" from Colchis, Jason met Medea and fell in love with her. The princess used her potions (most of which consisted of concentrated colchicine) to help Jason poison the warriors and dragons that stood guard over the fleece. The use of the bulb-like corms of Colchicum for gout traces back to 550 A.D., as the \"hermodactyl (Iris)\" recommended by the Byzantine physician, Alexander of Tralles (today-Aydin in Turkey) [3] . While the Greeks and Romans knew about the use of colchicine for gout, the drug wasn't available in pure form until the late nineteenth century. The active pharmacological component of the plant, colchicum, was isolated in 1820 and in 1833, P.L. Geiger purified the active ingredient, which he named colchicine [4] .",

Pernice, an Italian pathologist, found that when therapeutic doses of colchicine were given to experimental animals, lesions were produced in the nuclei of gastric and intestinal cells as these cells were arrested in metaphase [6] . In 1967, Ed Taylor and Gary Borisy used tritiated colchicine to identify the target of colchicine in dividing and non-dividing cells [7] . The protein they identified was the dimeric building block of microtubules, subsequently given the name \"tubulin\" by Mohri [8] . We now know that the traffic of intracellular materials is carried over tracks formed by microtubules [9] .",

In acute gout, colchicine is effective in alleviating the acute attack and as a prophylactic medication. In Beh\u00e7et disease, colchicine is effective mainly in the treatment of mucosal ulcers, especially in female genitalia. In systemic sclerosis, colchicine may decrease the stiffness of the skin whereas in amyloidosis it may result in regression of amyloid deposition loci where serum amyloid A (SAA) fibers are deposited [10, 11] . Since 1972, colchicine has gained popularity as being the main effective remedy for FMF [12] . In this disease, colchicine prevents the occurrence of the acute inflammatory episodes and the development of amyloidosis. However, colchicine is not effective in controlling acute attacks when administered once they occur.",

Altered intestinal PGY1 expression can change the absorption of drugs transported by this peptide, including colchicine. Therefore, PGY-1 is critical in the regulation of its bioavailability and plasma concentrations, which can lead to sub-optimal therapeutic effects or, alternatively, to drug toxicity [19, 20] .

Compared with non-responders (who usually have more severe disease), treatment responders had a twofold greater concentration of colchicine in mononuclear cells, which was attributed to a potential genetic effect independent of MEFV mutations [23, 24] . Specifically, the distribution of ABCB1 3435 C and T-genotypes was significantly different between colchicine-responders and non-responders, with the 3435C allele significantly increasing the risk of resistance to colchicine, whereas in patients with the 3435T genotype a decreased colchicine dose was needed to obtain an adequate response [23] .",

They found that after IV administration of 1 mg of the drug to healthy volunteers, the peak plasma concentration averaged 0.32 + 1.17 \u03bcg/100 mL. After IV administration of 2.0 mg of colchicine, a rapid drop of plasma levels occurred during the first 10 min, followed by a logarithmic decline [26] . The rapidity of colchicine disappearance from the plasma and its persistent excretion days after drug ingestion suggest that it is trapped in body tissues for a prolonged period. Indeed, the [27] . An example for such binding is the detection of colchicine in leukocytes 10 days after a single IV dose [28] . Furthermore, it was shown that in plasma 40% of the colchicine is bound to albumin [29] . After oral administration of colchicine, the Tmax (the time needed to reach peak plasma levels) is 1-3 h [14] . However, maximal anti-inflammatory effects develop over 24-48 h based upon intra-leukocytes accumulation of the drug [30] . Initial studies reported terminal elimination half-life time (T 1/2 ) from 19 min (after IV administration) to 16 h (after oral ingestion) [31] . In an additional study, the mean T 1/2 was 9.3 h, similar to findings in patients with FMF without renal or liver disease (T 1/2 of about 9 \u00b1 4 h) [27, 32] . In a study in which we evaluated the pharmacokinetics of colchicine in patients with FMF with and without renal or liver disease, we found that colchicine clearance was significantly impaired in those with kidney or liver failure [27] . The T 1/2 of colchicine in patients with severe renal failure was two-to threefold longer and in a patient with both renal failure and cirrhosis tenfold longer than in patients with normal renal and liver function. Leighton et al. [33] reported similar results in patients with liver cirrhosis. These findings suggest that patients with either liver or renal disease should be closely monitored even when treated with conventional doses of colchicine.",

Bessis and Gorius discovered that colchicine disrupts microtubules in a dose-dependent fashion [41] . Colchicine does not enhance microtubule dissolution but abrogates the process of microtu-bule self-assembly by forming tubulin-colchicine complexes [42, 43] . Colchicine reduces the generation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 by macrophages and its receptors on endothelial cells [44, 45] . Colchicine also has been shown to interfere with the interaction of neutrophils and the vascular endothelium by abrogating their binding to adhesion molecules. Colchicine abrogates the E-selectin-mediated adhesiveness of the cytokinestimulated vascular endothelium to neutrophils. It also alters the distribution of the adhesion molecules on the surface of endothelial cells and neutrophils, significantly reducing their interaction [46] . In addition, at high concentrations colchicine suppresses phospholipase A 2 activation, lysosomal enzyme release and phagocytosis [47] . Conversely, colchicine does not exert its anti-inflammatory effect through inhibition of cyclooxygenases [48] .",

Pyrin does not directly recognize Rho modification, but probably senses events downstream of Rho modification. Xu et al. showed that activation of RhoA inhibits pyrin activity while inactivation of RhoA causes over activation of pyrin resulting in increased production of IL-1, thereby enhancing inflammation. Clostridium toxin inactivates RhoA thereby leading to less production or recruitment of protein kinases (PKNs) and thereby less phosphorylation of pyrin [57] . 14 3 3** peptides (**the name reflect the migration pattern on 2D DEAE gel of these acidic proteins family) are group of proteins which interact with phosphorylated pyrin [58] . Decreased phosphorylation of pyrin leads to less interaction and reduced binding by 14 3 3 peptides. This increases the amount of free pyrin which can recruit apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and procaspase \u22121 to construct the pyrin inflammasome, leading to increased secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and an enhanced inflammatory process (Fig. 40.2) .",

Cyclosporine is a prime example of a drug that can inhibit or modulate the ABCB1 transporter [75] . Potentiation of colchicine neuromyopathy can occur within weeks of commencement of cyclosporine therapy. This complication is often associated with cyclosporine nephropathy and a decline in the glomerular filtration rate [75, 76] . Notably, cyclosporine was found to delay colchicine-induced diarrhea in an animal model system, likely due to modulation of intestinal ABCB1. Hence, it is suspected that cyclosporine could mask the gastrointestinal side effects of colchicine in humans that might otherwise be a clue to the development of systemic colchicine toxicity.",

CYP3A4 is a focal point of many drug-drug interactions and dietary and herbal interactions. CYP3A4 may be stimulated by its substrates (\"normotropic cooperativity\") or its effectors (\"heterotropic cooperativity\"), which renders prediction of drug-drug interactions difficult [79, 80] . These substances may be divided into three groups. The first group contains drugs, such as cimetidine, which have an inhibitory effect on the entire cytochrome system. Indeed, in animal studies, it was shown that concomitant administration of cimetidine and colchicine resulted in a significant rise in serum colchicine concentration. The second group contains substances that have a specific inhibitory effect on the isoform CYP3A4 which metabolizes colchicine. These include erythromycin, ketoconazole and other medications. The third group includes drugs that are also metabolized by CYP3A4, such as cyclosporine and nifedipine, and may compete with colchicine for binding to the enzyme. The interaction in these cases is dictated by the affinity of each medication for the enzyme. Thus, coadministration of medications and substances metabolized by the same cytochrome system may lead, in principle, to an increase of one or more of the drugs, exposing the patient to a higher risk of toxicity.",

These include the macrolide antibiotics erythromycin and clarithromycin, and the statins, e.g. lovastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin [81] . Clarithromycin is a particularly striking case in point and has been associated with at least 2 fatalities with concomitant colchicine use [82] . However, azithromycin (a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor) had minimal effects on colchicine concentration and terminal elimination half-life, and decreased total apparent oral clearance by only 30%. Azithromycin should be recommended as a safer alternative to clarithromycin in patients taking colchicine [81] . Mutual potentiation by colchicine and statins of myopathy (sometimes including rhabdomyolysis) is a notable concern [83, 84] . Significantly, case studies have reported acute myopathy after concurrent use of colchicine with a statin that was either not metabolized or minimally metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme [78, 85] . In this context, fluvastatin can disrupt the integrity of the cytoskeleton and is linked with vacuolization and other pathology in muscle, which is pertinent given the capacity of colchicine to promote vacuolization in muscle by disruption of the microtubule network.",

A case report by Merlin described a patient with gout who developed azoospermia following treatment with colchicine [89] . Re-challenge again induced azoospermia. Because patients with FMF receiving colchicine are often in their child-bearing years, the concern about fertility is pertinent. Indeed, rabbits treated with a relatively high dose of colchicine showed various degenerative changes of the testes, including loss of differentiation from spermatogonia to spermatozoa [90] . However, Cohen et al. performed cytogenetic evaluation in patients with FMF receiving long-term colchicine. Mitotic rates, percentage of tetraploidy, and chromosomal breakage rates were determined in lymphocytes [91] . No significant differences were found between the patients and controls.",

Sperm motility was inhibited significantly only after an incubation period of at least 18 h, with a minimal colchicine concentration of 10 \u03bcg/mL. Because plasma colchicine concentration under therapeutic dose is about 3-9 \u014bg/mL, the amount of colchicine needed for affecting sperm motility in vitro is 3000-fold higher.

The association of FMF attacks and menstruation raises the possibility of hormonal influences (see Chap. 16). Indeed, it was shown that estrogen significantly decreases intercellular adhesion molecules [101] . Furthermore, it was demonstrated that estrogens inhibit tubulin assembly by interacting directly with tubulin 6S sites analogous to colchicine sites [102] . Moreover, estrogen is metabolized by the 3A4 liver CYP-450 complex and competes in binding it with colchicine. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that estrogens mimic the effect of colchicine on tubules and adhesion molecules, thereby enhancing the effect of colchicine. During menstruation, there is a sharp decrease in estrogens, thus their accumulative suppressive effect on inflammation is suddenly diminished. In addition, the reduction in estrogen, allows for a more effective metabolism of colchicine by the 3A4 cytochrome (less inhibitory competition by estrogen) so that the effective level of colchicine may be further reduced. This situation may lead to menstruation associated FMF attack. To control these attacks, it is recommended to increase the dose of colchicine (by 0.5 mg) for 2 days prior to the onset of the menstrual period and for two more days after its onset (see Chap. 16).",

Serious concern was raised regarding a teratogenic effect of colchicine. Therefore, in the 1970s physicians advised their patients to discontinue colchicine 3 months before planning conception and during pregnancy. Sporadic reports claimed that colchicine was safe during pregnancy. Furthermore, in a study which followed 36 pregnant women with FMF treated with colchicine, the outcome of the newborns was the same as in an untreated control group [103] . In another study, all 13 women with FMF, who had 16 pregnancies and were on colchicine, gave birth to normal children [104] . However, Rabinovitch et al. reported that 4 newborns out of 2000 (1:500) deliveries of FMF patients were born with trisomy 21, twice the expected rate of a comparable normal population [105] . It was not clear whether colchicine therapy itself plays a role with this increment outcome. Recently, Diav-Citrin et al. examined the safety of fetuses by following mothers exposed to colchicine during pregnancy. In a prospective observational comparative cohort study between 1994 and 2006 they found that colchicine did not appear to be a major human teratogen, and, probably, has no cytogenetic effect [106] .",

Primary biliary cirrhosis is a rational potential indication, given the intense concentration of colchicine in bile and the evolving understanding of the capacity of colchicine to modulate bile composition [124] . However, a meta-analysis combining the results of 15 randomized controlled trials encompassing 1714 subjects with alcoholic or non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis, demonstrated no significant effects of colchicine on mortality, liver related mortality, complications and other outcomes [125] . In a recent double blind, randomized controlled trial in 74 subjects with chronic liver cirrhosis who could not be treated with interferon-\u03b1, Muntoni et al. demonstrated that colchicine at a dose of 1 mg per day significantly increased survival (94.6% vs. 78.4% p = 0.001), and decreased serum procollagen III (a biomarker of liver fibrosis) over a follow up period of 4.4 years [126] .This suggests that there may be a beneficial effect of colchicine for selected subjects with liver cirrhosis. Additional research has assessed whether colchicine can delay the development of hepatic cell carcinoma (HCC) in patients diagnosed with hepatitis virus-related liver cirrhosis [127] . While the effect of colchicine on the progression of cirrhosis was disappointing, colchicine suppressed the development of HCC. Nine percent of patients treated with colchicine developed HCC versus 29% of untreated patients (P \u22120.0001), and the time to development of HCC was longer in the colchicine-treated group.",

Elevated highsensitivity (hs) CRP is both a predictor and a pathogenic factor in vascular events such as coronary artery disease [137] . A recent pilot study evaluated whether low-dose colchicine as an anti-inflammatory treatment could lower hs-CRP levels in patients with stable coronary artery disease whose CRP remained elevated despite aspirin and high-dose atorvastatin therapy [138] . Low-dose oral colchicine (0.5 mg twice daily) was associated with decreased hs-CRP levels by 60%. However, in a separate, randomized study of 80 patients with acute coronary syndrome or stroke, Raju et al. found no significant association between colchicine use (1 mg daily) and CRP reduction, suggesting either that the dose studied was insufficient in the acute setting, or that colchicine may be more effective when administered as a prophylactic rather than as a treatment agent [139] . More recently, Nidorf et al. evaluated the effect of colchicine (0.5 mg daily) on secondary cardiovascular events in 532 patients with stable coronary artery disease already on aspirin and/or clopidogrel and statin therapy [140] . Patients were followed for a median of 3 years. The primary outcome,-the composite incidence of acute syndromes, out-ofhospital cardiac arrest, and non-cardio-embolic ischemic stroke-occurred in 5.3% of patients treated with colchicine versus 16% of patients receiving placebo. These results warrant further study of the potential benefit of colchicine in the prevention of acute coronary syndrome. There is growing evidence that inflammation plays a role in the re-stenosis process. Therefore, one study randomized 196 patients with diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with bare-metal stent placement to receive either colchicine 0.5 mg or placebo twice daily for 6 months [141] . Subsequent angiography indicated that the rate of angiographic in-stent restenosis was 16% in the colchicine group versus 33% in the placebo group (p = 0.007).",

In a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study by Deftereos et al., 3 months of colchicine monotherapy was associated with a 16% reduction in the incidence of atrial fibrillation after pulmonary vein isolation with radiofrequency ablation [144] . The colchicine group also experienced a significant decrease in IL-6 and CRP levels.",
