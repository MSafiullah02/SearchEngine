            "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic had a slow start in India due to strict restrictions and screening imposed on foreign travel, but by the first week of March 2020, it was clear that the surgical store of our hospital needed to rapidly ramp up its inventory of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), well ahead of an anticipated increased transmission. PPE items provided by our regular vendors were not available as complete kits. In addition, some important items such as coveralls were not being routinely procured. Logistical delays from the nationwide lockdown, financial constraints like fluctuating pricing and demands for advance payment as well as regulatory pressure due to caps imposed on purchase quantity and pricing, made it difficult to procure PPE. The supply chain disruption consequent upon limited supply of raw material with manufacturers and export bans imposed by other countries added to the complexity of the issue. Managing the supply chain of PPE in this scenario was difficult and made it necessary to evolve new systems and guidelines to mitigate these conditions. Our hospital responded by bringing together a team consisting of hospital administrators, microbiologists, and clinicians. An equitable model for appropriate use of PPE in various healthcare settings was created, which also reassured and boosted the morale of healthcare workers. It was decided to assemble PPE kits in-house from piecemeal purchases of individual items of appropriate quality. An assembly line was put in place where components of the PPE kit were added in sequence until the final completed product was packed and ready for distribution.",

It is typically used inventory management of the personal kit issued to each fighting unit and also used by the United Nations Peace Keeping Forces (The UN Brick) [1] . The system also envisages different types of kits required at different levels. This method was modified by a hospital administrator having previous experience in the Indian Army Medical Corps. The number of beds in a given medical unit and the human resources needed to operationalise it were considered a functional unit. The number of PPE kits required per day was ascertained. For laboratories, the monthly requirement was considered. The requisite number of in-house PPE kits for the various wards were then assembled into one brick(a carton) and supplied to that unit on a daily basis. The brick system aids in inventory management by rationalising the indents, keeping track of future requirements and projecting the purchasing of components far ahead of time.",
