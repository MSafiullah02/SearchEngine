Airborne transmission happens when droplets containing viruses or bacteria get on mucous membranes [2] . There are two main avenues for the spread of COVID-19. One way involves contacts with contaminated surfaces and subsequent touching mouth, nose or eyes. However, the majority of transmissions is believed to happen by person-to-person spread through respiratory droplets [3] . Such droplets are produced when infected person coughs or sneezes and can spread up to two meters and stay in the air several hours [4] .",

Consequent layers are made from different filtering materials and remove droplets and microparticles of smaller and smaller sizes. Moreover, middle layer consists of activated carbon which can absorb harmful gases, for example, NO x , CO, CH x , O 3 . Such masks remove 95% (N-95) and 99% (N-99) of particles larger than 0.3 microns from the air stream [7] . Such design of the mask substantially reduces the probability of contamination. However, it can't completely protect from the virus reaching the organism (the size of SARS-CoV-2 virus particle is ~ 100 nm [8] ). Moreover, after prolonged wearing all layers of the mask accumulate various pathogens and themselves become the source of infection [6] . We propose to solve both problems by adding two extra layers to the standard mask: i) plasma layer, formed by dielectric barrier discharge, and ii) the layer which protects the skin from direct exposure to the plasma. Figure 2 shows two new layers that are proposed to be added to the standard N-95/99 respirator. The first additional layer (farthest from the skin) is a standard dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) formed by wire electrodes surrounded by a dielectric layer. The polarity of the electrodes alternates, which leads to the formation of a nonequilibrium lowtemperature plasma between the walls of individual dielectric tubes. It is known [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] that such plasma is extremely active antimicrobial media.",

In our system we expect the major disinfection effect to originate from (4) and (5) . In the case of nonequilibrium air plasma, gas heating is negligible and does not exceed tens of degrees. This increase is sufficient for the destruction of biomolecules directly in the region of the discharge, but even at a small distance from it the thermal action of the plasma on bacteria and viruses can be neglected. The major part of UV radiation of air DBD plasma is concentrated in the bands of the second positive system of nitrogen (with the strongest transition at 337.1 nm). Such quanta usually don't break bonds in biomolecules and are not an effective means of disinfection (unlike, for example, mercury radiation at 253.7 nm, which leads to irreversible DNA/RNA damage and stops the growth of bacteria and viruses [9, 10] ). Plasma nitrogen oxides are generally regarded as stimulants of the natural response of the immune system. The main mechanism of action of oxidizing agents (O 3 , H 2 O 2 ) on viruses is the destruction of their receptors. The loss of receptors disables virus ability of attacking human cell, which makes its reproduction impossible. Positive and negative ions act on viruses in the similar way as molecular oxidizing agents, often enhancing the effect of the latter [11] . Figure 2 .

The discharge develops in the gap between the dielectric capillaries, where the entire air flow passes; 4 -switch, sensitive to the direction of the air flow.

It happens because microdrops and single microorganisms in the air usually accumulate a noticeable negative charge due to the high mobility of free electrons in the air. Negatively charged drops and microparticles could be carried away from the flow to the surface by the electric field. Thus, a small residual positive charge on the surface of the DBD electrodes mechanically removes microparticles from the stream.

Such currents cannot lead to any dangerous consequences even in the case of direct contact of the high-voltage electrode with the skin. In addition, all electrodes are surrounded by the dielectric layer, which makes direct contact with high voltage electrodes impossible.

The amplitude of the pulses should be selected based on the characteristic distance between the electrodes. With a typical diameter of the dielectric d = 1 mm and the open area ~10% of the layer (gap between electrodes is \u03b4 ~ 0.1 mm), the peak-to-peak voltage at the electrodes should be ~ 3 kV (1.5 kV amplitude).",

It is not acceptable for common electronic devices but it is namely the regime required for the DBD plasma generation. The thickness of the PFTE dielectric layer of such a wire is 0.25 mm (breakdown voltage of 6 kV), which ensures its durability as an electrode for dielectric barrier discharge up to voltages of 1.5-2 kV (3-4 kV peak-to-peak) with a sufficient safety margin.
