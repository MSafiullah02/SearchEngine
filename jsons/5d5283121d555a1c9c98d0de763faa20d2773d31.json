We develop two differential equations models to account for this period. The first is a model that incorporates infected persons in the exposed class, before transmission is possible. The second is a model that incorporates a time delay in infected persons, before transmission is possible. We apply both models to the COVID-19 epidemic in China. We estimate the epidemiological parameters in the models, such as the transmission rate and the basic reproductive number, using data of reported cases. We thus evaluate the role of the exposed or latency period in the dynamics of a COVID-19 epidemic.",

We note that public measures in China, beginning January 26, strongly attenuated the epidemic. One of our objectives is to understand how these measures, such as isolation, quarantine, and public closings, reduce the final size of the epidemic. We examine how the latency period, tied contact tracing and to a 14-day medical observation or quarantine period for exposed persons, mitigates the final size of the epidemic.",

The main difference from our previous papers [5] and [6] is that we consider a latency period in the two models. In model SEIRU, an exposed class E is used to model latency. Newly infected individuals enter the class E, where they are neither symptomatic nor infectious. From this exposed class, noninfectious asymptomatic individuals enter an infectious asymptomatic class I. From I, asymptomatic infectious individuals enter a class R or U where they are symptomatic infectious, and later are reported R or unreported U . In model SEIRU\u03b4 a time delay is used to model latency. Newly infected individuals enter the class I after a fixed time delay \u03b4, and then proceed through classes R and U .",

This mean that for both models, \u03bd = 1/7 is better than \u03bd = 1/5. Furthermore, Table 3 also indicates that model SEIRU\u03b4 gives a better prediction than model SEIRU. We also deduce that the best exposure period varies between 6 hours for model SEIRU\u03b4 and 12 hours for model SEIRU. Our finding is consistent with Zou [14] where the high viral load observed for COVID-19 was used to explain that the transmission can occur at the early stage of the infection. This gives an explanation for the very short exposure period which give the best fit with data here. This also justifies the fact that in our previous articles [5, 6, 8] we neglected the exposure period.",
