[2, 3] Molecular mimicry indicates shared homologies between normal human myelin protein and viral polypeptides. An immune response against such a viral epitope can be extended to the homologue region of the normal human protein. In MS, homology between myelin antigens and viral peptides is established. [4] Thus, this mechanism could result in CNS demyelination after viral infection. Superantigens are a class of immunostimulatory molecules produced by bacteria and viruses that can induce the activation of a large number of T cells.",

            "text": "Genetic factors play an important role in MS. Biological relatives of individuals with MS have a greater susceptibility to MS than adoptees, and the closer the biological relationship the greater the risk for developing MS. Although the rate of MS is 8 times higher in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins, genetics alone are insufficient to cause the disease. In identical twin pairs in whom one twin has MS, only 28% of the other twins develop the disease, even with long term follow-up. Despite sophisticated genetic studies, no single gene has been consistently linked to MS, although an association with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II alleles DR2 and DQw1 has been demonstrated. [6] Clusters of MS outbreaks have also been reported, supporting a role for an infectious agent in the pathogenesis of this disease. The sudden appearance of MS on the Faroe Islands after the occupation by English troops in 1940 suggested an inter-human transmission of the disease. [5, 7] Rohowsky-Kochan et al. [8] implicated canine distemper virus (CDV) as a possible causal agent of MS. The dog population of the Faroe Islands developed the neurologi-cal form of CDV at the beginning of the war, which correlated with the introduction into the islands of guard dogs by the British troops. Other authors developed a tick-borne virus theory of MS, [9] based on correlations of high rates of MS and specific tick species associated with migratory seabirds vectoring an arbovirus. Birds have also been considered to be carriers of viral vectors associated with a cluster of MS cases in Key West, Florida, US from 1972 to 1986. [10] In addition to the geographical association of disease susceptibly with evidence of MS, other data implicating a virus in the aetiology of MS include: [11] \u2022 Epidemiological evidence of childhood exposure to infectious agents in patients with MS. \u2022 An increase in disease exacerbation with viral infection. \u2022 Abnormal immune responses to a variety of viruses in patients with MS. \u2022 Analogy with animal models and other human diseases in which viruses can cause disorders with long incubation periods, a relapsing-remitting course and demyelination. Assuming MS is triggered by an infectious agent there are a variety of mechanisms by which demyelination may be induced: [12] \u2022 Viral infection of glial cells, such as oligodendrocytes, may directly damage these cells. However, as yet, no virus has been detected in the brain or other tissues of patients with MS. Despite this, recent examples of infectious diseases in which the agent was not identified for many years include Helicobacter pylori-induced peptic ulcer, [13] Borrelia burgdoferi for Lyme disease [14] and the cat scratch disease. [15] \u2022 Molecular mimicry may also play a role in MS where structural similarity between viral T cell epitopes and self-peptides could lead to the induction of an autoaggressive T cell response.",

SFV and JHM are associated with a chronic immune response mediated by CD4+ cells. JHM virus induces an acute encephalomyelitis with scattered demyelinating lesions in mice and with necrotic lesions distributed throughout the CNS in rats. LDV may cause disease only in mice that encode a particular endogenous retroviral component. [17] Infections caused by Lentiviruses (a family of retroviruses, all of which produce chronic encephalopathies) are persistent and occur in large mammals such as cats, sheep, goats and horses. The most relevant examples for MS are the Visna-Maedi virus of sheep and the caprine arthritis-encephalomyelitis virus. [16] Both viruses are associated with an active inflammatory process.

[43] Immunological recognition of viral peptides of sufficient structural similarity to the immunodominant MBP peptide may lead to clonal extension of MBP-reactive T cells in MS. Viruses such as HSV or Epstein Barr virus (EBV), which are known to cause latent or persistent infections, may under specific conditions, lead to a chronic antigenic stimulation of autoreactive T cell clones. An immunodominant region of MBP (84-102) is predominantly found in individuals who are carriers of HLA-DR2 and who have MS and has sequence homology to some viruses. [2] Retroviruses have long been considered as candidate agents in the pathogenesis of MS. In 1989, Perron et al. [36] described the production of extracellular virions associated with reverse transcriptase activity by a culture of leptomeningeal cells (LM7) obtained from the CSF of a patient with MS. More recently, the same group was able to identify a specific retroviral sequence associated with virions produced by cell cultures from several patients with MS. [42] They called this new retrovirus MSassociated retrovirus (MSRV). Its molecular characterisation has revealed that it is distantly related (75% homology) to the sequence of ERV9 (a well characterised endogenous retrovirus), but at present it is still unclear whether MSRV itself is exogenous or endogenous. However, Brahic and Bureau [44] have suggested that sequences nearly identical to MSRV have been described previously, are endogenous and are expressed both in MS and control human tissues.",

In 1995, Challoner et al., [40] using representational difference analysis, detected HHV-6 DNA in 70% of brain samples from individuals with MS and controls, suggesting that the HHV-6 is a common commensal virus of the brain. In addition, monoclonal antibodies against HHV-6 had detected the virus only in brain tissues of MS patients and not controls. More recently, Soldan et al. [11] demonstrated increased IgM serum antibody responses to HHV-6 early antigen in patients with relapsingremitting MS, compared with patients with chronic progressive MS, patients with other neurological and autoimmune disease, and healthy controls.",

[38, 39] One of the first pieces of evidence for interaction between herpes virus and retrovirus is proposed in a study of an avian model of Burkitt's lymphoma.

Recently, aciclovir (acyclovir), a drug that selectively inhibits replication of herpes viruses, has been used to test the hypothesis that herpes virus infections are involved in the pathogenesis of relapsing-remitting MS. [61] The use of this drug decreased exacerbations by 34%, suggesting that acyclovir-susceptible viruses might be involved in the pathogenesis of MS, in particular in the induction of exacerbations. It is clear that a better understanding of the characteristics of pathological agent(s) would lead to the development of appropriate therapeutic strategies for MS.",

However, even if no virus has been definitively implicated in the aetiology of MS, the failure to demonstrate a virus in this disease does not mean that it is not present: 'absence of evidence is not evidence of absence'.
