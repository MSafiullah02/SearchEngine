The main difference from previous works is that we take dynamic properties of cascades into consideration: (1) the cascade initiator is dynamic since we do not know who will initiate another harmful diffusion next time, and (2) the diffusion process is dynamic since the propagation trajectory is uncertain. Under these two dynamic sources, we aim to accurately and fast select k nodes as sensors for early detection of harmful cascades. Besides, as the size of network becomes more and more large-scale, we also need to ensure the effectiveness of the proposed sensor selection methods for large networks.",

Our contributions are summarized as follows:\u2022We formulate a Detection Time Minimization (DTM) problem. To describe the dynamic harmful cascade on networks, we put forward a dynamic cascade model for the harmful diffusion.\u2022We prove that it is #P-hard to exactly calculate the objective function of DTM problem and propose two equivalent Monte-Carlo methods to estimate it. Each has its advantages and disadvantages.\u2022We show the NP-hardness of DTM problem as it can be shown to contain the Set Cover problem as a simple special case. We convert the DTM problem to a constrained max optimization problem, prove the submodularity of the new objective function, and then employ the greedy algorithm which achieves an approximation ratio of 1 \u2212 1/e.\u2022We theoretically establish new upper bounds for the remaining time. Based on these bounds, we further propose a new Upper Bound based Greedy (UBG in short) algorithm which can significantly reduce the number of estimations in greedy-based algorithms, especially at the initial step.\u2022We propose two accelerations of UBG: Quickest-Path-UBG and Local-Reduction-UBG to address the DTM problem for large networks, which are close to UBG in performance but orders of magnitude faster than UBG in time complexity.\n",

Providers, such as Twitter or Facebook, have an immediate access to all tweets or postings as they are submitted to their server [6], [29], while outside observers need an efficient mechanism to monitor changes, such as the methods developed in this work. Another example, an emerging trend in algorithmic stock trading is the use of automatic search through the Web and social networks for pieces of information that can be used in trading decisions before they appear in the more popular news sites [23], [27]. Similarly, intelligence, business and politics analysts are scanning online sources for new information.

Thus, the process can be reviewed with respect to some particular uninfected node v: as time unfolds, more and more of v's neighbors become infected; at some point, this may cause v to become infected, and v's decision may in turn trigger further infections by nodes connected with v.",

When considering adding another node u as a new sensor into S, the reduction of the expected detection time can be put as follows(30)\u03b4u(S)=\u2211w\u2208V\u03c0(w)(E[\u03c4(w,S)]\u2212E[\u03c4(w,S\u222a{u})]),which is by Eq. (5). We now use Theorem 7 to present the concrete expression of the right part of Eq. (30). Similar with the definition of Eq. (1), we predefine the parents of set S as follows,(31)Par(S):={u\u2208V\u2216S,\u2203v\u2208S,s.t.(u,v)\u2208E}.\nTheorem 7\nIn the DSI model with infection probability\nip(w,v)\non a directed graph G\n = (V, E), the reduction \u03b4\nu(S) of the expected detection time can be calculated like this\n\n(32)\u03b4u(S)=\u03c0(u)\u00b7f(u,S)+\u2211w\u2208Par(u)\u2216[S\u222aPar(S)]\u03c0(w)\u00b7(Tmax\u2212f(w,S))\u2211w\u2208Par(u)\u22c2Par(S)\u03c0(w)\u00b7(f(w,S)\u2212f(w,S\u222a{u}))\nunder one-hop assumption, where f(u, S) is defined as\n11\u2212\u220fv\u2208S(1\u2212ip(u,v))\u2227Tmax\n.\nProofUnder one-hop assumption, the reduction \u03b4\nu(S) of the expected detection time incurred on selecting u into the sensor set S mainly includes: (a) u itself reduced from f(u, S) to 0; (b) each w in the remaining non-detected parents of u reduced from T\nmax to f(w,S); and (c) each w in the intersection of parents of u and parents of S reduced from f(w,S) to f(w,S\u222a{u}). In other cases, we have E[\u03c4(w,S)]=E[\u03c4(w,S\u222a{u})]. Hence Eq. (32) is followed. \u25a1\n",
