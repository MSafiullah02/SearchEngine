Suppose that there are two pairs of agents having risky partnerships to begin with: Ann and Bob are one pair, and Chlo\u00e9 and Dane the other (Network 1 in Figure 1) . Each individual has a fixed probability of contracting a given virus independently of her partnerships, and an infected individual transmits the virus in any given partnership with probability p. Infection and transmission are independent across agents and partnerships, respectively. To build intuition, consider first the extreme case in which each partnership transmits the virus with probability one-that is, p = 1. The partnership between Chlo\u00e9 and Bob is risky for each of them, since under some states of the world only one of them is infected, and hence their partnership would infect the other. We claim that Ann and Dane's partnership (that is, a switch from Network 1 to Network 2 in Figure 1 ) increases Chlo\u00e9 and Bob's incentives to become partners (as long as their initial partnerships are sufficiently valuable so that neither of them wants to become isolated instead). Indeed, in Network 2, the states of the world where one catches the virus are the same as the states of the world where the other one catches it, so their partnership is risk free. Remarkably, the same is true for all positive values of the transmission probability p: Ann and Dane's partnership decreases the probability that only one of Chlo\u00e9 and Bob is infected, hence increasing their incentives to become partners.",

Indeed, a free and perfectly safe but only partially effective vaccine necessarily makes everyone better off in these models. Kremer (1996, page 555) explains the logic as follows: 1 Adoption of an imperfectly effective vaccine could not cause the number of partners to increase so much that [the per-interaction probability of infection] increased, because people would not be willing to have more partners if the probability of infection from an additional partner increased.",

In order to clarify this point, and to highlight the role that the strategic choice of partners plays in the mechanism that we illustrate, in Appendix B we describe a random-matching version of our model, and we show that, as long as the infection risk is not extreme, strategic complementarities in risky partnerships do not arise in this model.

To understand this picture, it is useful to keep in mind that the transmission probability p affects agents' optimal actions in two different ways. On the one hand, p is the probability that infection is transmitted between two prospective partners. On the other hand, p influences the probability that the agents under consideration have already become infected through contagion from other agents in their networks. This explains why the risk of edge N 2 N 3 is increasing in p for low values of p and decreasing in p for high values of p: the risk of edge N 2 N 3 is highest when the transmission probability is high enough so that this edge has a substantial probability of transmitting an infection but low enough so that there is a substantial probability that only one of N 2 and N 3 are infected.",

In the case that we have focused on throughout the main body of the paper (in which agents only value up to two heterosexual partnerships), this step is simpler because Network N is a strict subset of Network X, which directly implies that everyone's infection probabilities are strictly smaller in the former than in the latter. In the more general setting discussed in this section, the reasoning is a bit more subtle, because there are edges in the (m + 1)-network that are not in the m ab -network, and vice versa. As a result, it is not immediate to see that, when the transmission probability p is at the threshold p m , the infection probability of agents a and b in the (m + 1)-complete network is larger than in the m ab network. As we have shown, however, this is true as long as the threshold transmission probability p m is smaller than an upper bound p m > 0. As an illustration, the following table provides the approximate upper bounds on p m in the case m \u2208 {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and q = 1/4. Hence, if p 3 < .51, for example, then a reduction in the transmission probability forces a society that starts with a 3-complete network and a transmission probability just above p 3 to switch to a different social structure (e.g., a 4-complete network), potentially making everyone worse off unless the reduction in the transmission probability is large enough to compensate for the reduction in welfare created by the induced change in social structure.",

Beyond the specific modeling assumptions of this paper in terms of strategic network formation, the analysis in this section has shown that, as long as the threshold transmission probability p m is below p m , when the transmission probability p is close to p m , the (m + 1)-complete network gives lower welfare to everyone than the m-complete network. A similar analysis holds when we define the m-complete and the (m+1)-complete networks to be networks with distinct components, with the components not necessarily being cliques, but with everyone having exactly m \u2212 1 and m edges, respectively. Hence, the mechanism that we have illustrated in this paper is present in alternative models of network formation in which the agents organize themselves into different components (not necessarily cliques), and in which no two agents can have incentives to form an additional edge (so that, when the transmission probability p moves below a threshold, the efficient network is no longer stable, while a denser network can still be stable).",

On the one hand, if no one chooses to have zero partners before the intervention, equation (11) implies that some agents choose to have two partners after the intervention, so s 2 \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u00b5 p)\u00b5 pc > (1 \u2212 \u00b5p)\u00b5pc, a contradiction. 8 On the other hand, if some (but not all) agents choose to have zero partners before the intervention, we have that \u00b5pc = s 1 , so that \u00b5 pc > s 1 (i.e., no one chooses to have any partners after the intervention), also a contradiction. 7 This rules out situations in which agents are fatalistic, in the sense that they are so likely to become infected by their first partnership that they might as well choose additional partnerships (e.g., Kremer 1996) . Note that the mechanism that we illustrate in this paper does not rely on such extreme scenarios. 8 This inequality follows from the assumption that the equilibrium per-partnership probability \u00b5 p is below 1/2.",
