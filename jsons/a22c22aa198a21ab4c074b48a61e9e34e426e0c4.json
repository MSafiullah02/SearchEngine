This work focuses on one such application: disaster management in times of crises and calamities. The existing research on disaster damage analysis has primarily taken only unimodal information in the form of text or image into account. These unimodal systems, although useful, fail to model the relationship between the various modalities. Different modalities often present supporting facts about the task, and therefore, learning them together can enhance performance. We present MEMIS, a system that can be used in emergencies like disasters to identify and analyze the damage indicated by user-generated multimodal social media posts, thereby helping the disaster management groups in making informed decisions. Our leave-one-disaster-out experiments on a multimodal dataset suggest that not only does fusing information in different media forms improves performance, but that our system can also generalize well to new disaster categories. Further qualitative analysis reveals that the system is responsive and computationally efficient.",

In addition to using several different media forms and feature extraction techniques, several researchers have also employed various methods to combine the information obtained from these modalities, to make a final decision [19] . Yang et al. [28] developed a multimodal system-MADIS which leverages both text and image modalities, using hand-crafted features such as TF-IDF vectors, and low-level color features. Although their contribution was a step towards advancing damage assessment systems, the features used were relatively simple and weak, as opposed to the deep neural network models, where each layer captures complex information about the modality [17] . Therefore, we utilize the latent representation of text and image modalities, extracted from their respective deep learning models, as features to our system. Another characteristic that is essential for a damage assessment system is generalizability. However, most of the work carried out so far did not discuss this practical perspective. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, so far no work has been done on developing an end-to-end multimodal damage identification and assessment system.",

            "text": "Gated Approach for Relevance Filtering. For the two modules within Relevance Filtering, we use a simplistic approach of combining the outputs from the text and image models by using the OR function (\u2295). Technically speaking, we conclude that the combined output is positive if at least one of the unimodal models predicts so. Therefore, if a tweet is predicted as informative by either the text, or the image, or both the models, the system predicts the tweet as informative, and it is considered for further processing in the pipeline. Similarly, if at least one of the text and the image modality predicts an informative tweet as containing infrastructural damage, the tweet undergoes severity analysis. This simple technique helps avoid missing any tweet that might have even the slightest hint of damage, in either or both the modalities. Any false positive can also be easily handled in this approach. If, say, a non-informative tweet is predicted as informative in the first step at Relevance Filtering, it might still be the case that in the second step, the tweet is predicted as not containing any infrastructural damage. Furthermore, in case a tweet is unimodal and has just the text or the image, then the system can take the default prediction of the missing modality as negative (or False for a boolean OR function), which is the identity for the OR operation. In that case, the prediction based on the available modality will guide the analysis (Fig. 2) . Attention Fusion for Severity Analysis. The availability of data from different media sources has encouraged researchers to explore and leverage the potential boost in performance by combining unimodal classifiers trained on individual modalities [5, 27] . Here, we use attention fusion to combine the feature interpretations from the text and image modalities for the severity analysis module [12, 26] . The idea of attention fusion is to attend particular input features as compared to others while predicting the output class. The features, i.e., the outputs of the penultimate layer or the layer before the softmax, of the text and image models are concatenated. This is followed by a softmax layer to learn the attention weights for each feature dimension, i.e., the attention weight \u03b1 i for a feature x i is given by:",

Moving from the Relevance Filtering to the Severity Analysis module, we strengthen our fusion technique by using attention mechanism. This is required since human resources are almost always scarce, and it is necessary to correctly assess the requirements at different locations based on the severity of the damage. As opposed to an OR function, using attention, we are able to combine the most important information as seen by the different modalities to together analyze the damage severity. In this case, the treatment of unimodal tweets is not that straightforward, since the final prediction using attention fusion occurs after concatenation of the latent feature vectors of the individual modalities. Therefore, in case the text or image is missing, we use the unimodal model for the available modality. In other words, we use attention mechanism only when both the modalities are present to analyze damage severity, else we use the unimodal models.",

Alam et al. define a multimodal post as informative if it serves to be useful in identifying areas where damage has occurred due to disaster. It is therefore a binary classification problem, with the two classes being informative and non-informative. 2. Infrastructural Damage. The damage in an informative tweet may be of many different kinds [1, 4] . CrisisMMD identifies several categories for the type of damage, namely-Infrastructure and utility damage, Vehicle damage, Affected individuals, Missing or found people, Other relevant information, None. Alam et al. [1] also noted that the tweets which signify physical damage in structures, where people could be stuck, are especially beneficial for the rescue operation groups to provide aid. Out of the above-listed categories, the tweets having Infrastructure and utility damage are therefore identified in this task. This again is modelled as a classification problem with two classesinfrastructural and non-infrastructural damage. 3. Damage Severity Analysis. This final task uses the text and image modalities together to analyze the severity of infrastructural damage in a tweet ashigh, medium, or low. We add another label, no-damage, to support the pipeline framework that can handle false positives as well. Specifically, if a tweet having no infrastructural damage is predicted as positive, it can be detected here as having no damage. This is modelled as a multi-class classification problem.",

As input to the deep learning models, we use 100-dimensional Fasttext word embeddings [6] trained on the dataset. By operating at the character n-gram level, Fasttext tends to capture the morphological structure well. Thus, helping the otherwise out of vocabulary words (such as hash-tags) to share semantically similar embeddings with its component words. As shown in Table 2 , the RCNN model performed the best on all three tasks of the Relevance Filtering and Severity Analysis modules. Specifically, the average LODO F1-Scores of RCNN on the three tasks are 0.82, 0.76, and 0.79, respectively. Furthermore, the architecture considerably reduces the effect of noise in social media posts [14] . For images, we fine-tuned the VGG-16 [23] , ResNet-50 [11] and Incep-tionV3 [25] models, pre-trained on the ImageNet Dataset [9] . We also trained a CNN model from scratch. Experimental results in Table 2 reveal that Incep-tionV3 performed the best, and the average F1-Score with LODO training for the three tasks are 0.74, 0.77, and 0.79, respectively. The architecture employs multiple sized filters to get a thick rather than a deep architecture, as very deep networks are prone to over-fitting. Such a design makes the network computationally less expensive, which is a prime concern for our system as we want to minimize latency to give quick service to the disaster relief groups. Table 3 highlights the results of an ablation study over the best linguistic and vision models, along with the results obtained when the predictions by these individual models are combined as discussed in Sect. 4.3. The results for all the modules demonstrate the effectiveness of multimodal damage assessment models. Specifically, we observe that for each disaster category in the LODO training paradigm, the F1-Score for the multimodal model is always better than or compares with those of the text and image unimodal models.",

The multimodal system learns to attend the text features more and correctly classifies the sample as having no damage, even though both the individual models predicted incorrectly.

We developed a simulator program to act as the Tweet Streaming module that publishes tweets at different load rates (number of tweets in 1 second) to be processed by the downstream modules. The modules also process the incoming tweets at the same rate. We calculate the average time for processing a tweet by a particular module as the total processing time divided by the total number of tweets used in the experiment. We used 15, 000 multimodal tweets from CrisisMMD, streamed at varying rates. The performance of the two Relevance Filtering modules and the Severity Analysis module as we gradually increase the load rate is shown in the Fig. 3 . As a whole, including all the modules, we observed that on an average, the system can process 80 tweets in 1 minute. This experiment was done using an Intel i7-8550U CPU having 16 GB RAM. One can expect to see an improvement if a GPU is used over a CPU.",

Firstly, the results of our LODO experiments indicate that the system can perform well in case it is used for analyzing new disasters, which were not used for training the system. This makes it suitable for real-world deployment where circumstance with new disaster categories cannot be foreseen. Furthermore, we also saw how the two main modules of the system work seamlessly, even when one of the modalities is missing. This ensures that the system can utilize all the information that is available on the media platforms to analyze the disaster. Finally, the second module in Relevance Filtering can be trained to suit the needs of several relief groups that target different types of damage, and therefore, the system is capable of being utilized for many different response activities.",

Firstly, the system is contingent on the credibility i.e., the veracity of the content shared by users on social media platforms. It may so happen that false information is spread by some users to create panic amongst others [15] . In this work, we have not evaluated the content for veracity, and therefore, it will not be able to differentiate such false news media. Another aspect that is also critical to all systems that utilize data generated on social media is the socio-economic and geographic bias. Specifically, the system will only be able to get information about the areas where people have access to social media, mostly the urban cities, whereas damage in the rural locations may go unnoticed since it did not appear on Twitter or any other platform. One way to overcome this is to make use of aerial images, that can provide a top view of such locations as the rural lands. However, this again has a drawback as to utilize aerial images effectively, a bulk load of data would have to be gathered and processed.",

In this work, we propose MEMIS, a novel Multimodal Emergency Management Information System for identifying and analyzing the level of damage severity in social media posts with the scope for betterment in disaster management and planning. The system leverages both textual and visual cues to automate the process of damage identification and assessment from social media data. Our results show how the proposed multimodal system outperforms the state-of-the-art unimodal frameworks. We also report the system's responsiveness through extensive system analysis. The leave-one-disaster-out training setting proves the system is generic and can be deployed for any new unseen disaster.",
