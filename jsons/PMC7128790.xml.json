However, since Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) was first reported in Saudi Arabia in mid-2012, the same scientific enthusiasm shown for H7N9 had already begun to wane, with even less interest shown by Big Pharma.",

As a classic example of interspecies transmission, MERS-CoV can be transmitted to humans via animal reservoirs, probably dromedary camels, as well as close person-to-person contact [5], [6]. Transmissibility, coupled with the high structural similarity to SARS-CoV, which infected 8273 and killed 700 people in 2002\u20132003, initially sparked concerns about the pandemic potential of MERS, with the World Health Organization (WHO) classifying it as a \u201cthreat to the entire world\u201d [7]. Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV causes respiratory distress and multiple organ failure with a high fatality rate close to 35%. To date, about 1300 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 455 related deaths, have been reported to WHO (http://www.who.int/csr/don/12-june-2015-mers-korea/en/), but targeted and effective therapeutics remain to be elucidated, indicating a much slower response to this potential pandemic than reaction to the H7N9 bird flu.",

The S2 subunit then changes its conformation and partially inserts into the target cell, drawing viral and host cell surfaces closer in order to permit plasma membrane fusion.

In cell culture, HR2P can efficiently interfere with the fusion process and thus block viral entry and replication [11]. In collaboration with the team of Stanley Perlman at the University of Iowa, who developed a mouse model expressing human DPP4 (hDPP4) for MERS-CoV infection [12], the same researchers demonstrated that intranasal administration of HR2P-M2, an analogous peptide of HR2P with improved stability, solubility and antiviral activity, into hDPP4-transduced mice resulted in their protection from MERS-CoV challenge [13]. It is thus expected that HR2P-M2 peptide in a nasal spray formulation could be used to protect high-risk populations, including family members of MERS patients, healthcare workers and others who have had or will have close contact with MERS patients.",
