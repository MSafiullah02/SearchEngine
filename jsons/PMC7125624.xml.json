The idea of structural modifications of nucleosides and nucleotides gained interest fairly early and appeared fruitful supplying a wide variety of marketed compounds such as ribavirin, zidovudine, adefovir and many others (Fig. 1\n). In general, the modifications included replacements of the phosphate P(O)\u2013O\u2013C bond for the non-hydrolysable phosphonate P(O)\u2013C linkage, a furanose ring for other heterocyclic or even acyclic fragments or natural nucleobases for unnatural, substituted heteroaromatic or even homoaromatic systems. Several functionalities have been tried as linkers and aliphatic chains as well as 3- to 6-membered aliphatic and aromatic homo- and heterocyclic systems exemplify a long list of examples [1], [2], [3], [4].",

            "text": "Among commonly applied linkers a 1,2,3-triazole ring is of special interest since it is extremely easily to prepare by a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and biological activity of many 1,2,3-triazole derivatives has been recognised (Fig. 2\n). The idea of retaining the natural nucleobases with simultaneous introduction of the functionalised 1,2,3-triazole unit into a furanose ring led to compounds 1 and 2 which showed an antiviral activity [5], [6]. On the other hand 2\u2032,3\u2032-diethanethio-2\u2032,3\u2032,5\u2032-trideoxy-5\u2032-triazolonucleosides 3 displayed antitumour activity [7]. Recently, Kim et al. designed novel 1,2,3-triazole-appended C5-modified nucleosides 4 and their anticancer activity was demonstrated [8], [9]. Various acyclonucleosides [10], [11] and acyclonucleoside phosphonates [12] containing a 1,2,3-triazole unit were obtained from N-propargyl nucleobases and their antiviral activity was evaluated. Among them, pyrimidine- and purine-containing derivatives 5 and 6 appeared to be the most potent so far and exhibited anti-HCV activity (IC50 values of 16 \u03bcM) without any cytotoxicity at a concentration up to 100 \u03bcM. On the basis of a similar idea, novel 1,2,3-triazole nucleosides 7 linked to DNA nucleobases as a recognition element have been synthesised and their antiviral activity was evaluated [13].",

In this conformation the P(O)(OEt)2 and azido groups occupy the pseudoequatorial and pseudoaxial positions, respectively (Fig. 3\n) and thus reveal the trans relationship of H3 and H5. On the other hand, from the NMR spectra of the isoxazolidine 13 the following couplings were calculated: J(H3\u2013H4\u03b1) = 9.3 Hz, J(H3\u2013H4\u03b2) = 9.1 Hz, J(H4\u03b1\u2013P) = 4.8 Hz, J(H4\u03b2\u2013P) = 17.0 Hz, J(H4\u03b1\u2013H5) = 7.5 Hz, J(H4\u03b2\u2013H5) = 2.4 Hz and J(CCCP) = 10.3 Hz.

Because we were interested in the formation of single regioisomers of C4\u2032-substituted 1,2,3-triazoles, all reactions were carried out with equimolar amounts of the respective dipolarophiles 14 using Cu(I) as a catalyst, according to the procedure described by Sharpless [25], [26]. Indeed, 5-azidoisoxazolidin-3-yl-3-phosphonate trans-12 was cleanly transformed into C4\u2032-substituted 1,2,3-triazoles trans-15 in good to excellent yields, whereas from cis-13 and the respective alkynes 14, isoxazolidines cis-16 were produced exclusively. In all cycloadditions no epimerization at C5 in the isoxazolidine ring was observed.",

Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 cell culture inhibitory dose-50 (CCID50) of virus (1 CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) in the presence of varying concentrations (250, 50, 10, \u2026 \u03bcM) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. The methodology of the anti-HIV assays was as follows: human CEM (\u223c3 \u00d7 105\n cells/cm3) cells were infected with 100 CCID50 of HIV-1(IIIB) or HIV-2(ROD)/mL and seeded in 200 \u03bcL wells of a microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds. After 4 days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, HIV-induced CEM giant cell formation was examined microscopically.",
