In an attempt to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and \"flatten-the-curve,\" such that hospitals would not be overwhelmed at any given time with COVID-19 cases, various levels of social distancing were introduced in the United States.",

These 700,000 individuals are unable to practice social distancing while continuing lifesaving dialysis care. The necessity of in-person encounters for the vulnerable dialysis population and its health care workers is the Achilles' heel in our response to the pandemic, and key issues with COVID-19 and in-center hemodialysis are discussed next.",

Although several short-term changes can reduce the risk for widespread dissemination of COVID-19 in hemodialysis facilities, these mitigation strategies have limits in the absence of an ability to quarantine. Potential steps include implementing rigorous screening programs at hemodialysis facilities to identify potential cases; reducing crowding in waiting rooms; disinfecting items not typically addressed, such as hand rails on scales, waiting room seats, door knobs, and elevator buttons; and designating hemodialysis patients who are symptomatic as persons under investigation (PUIs), who are tested for COVID-19 and treated with enhanced precautions.",

Critically, although some individuals may be contagious when only minimally symptomatic, 7,8 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic individuals were not believed to significantly contribute to transmission in China. 9 In contrast, many patients with upper respiratory tract symptoms will not have COVID-19, suggesting that mandatory transfer of patients to hospitals without dialysis may not be a beneficial policy.",

To reduce risk within hemodialysis facilities providing dialysis to COVID-19-positive patients, it is important that hemodialysis facilities have easy access to rapid COVID-19 testing, sufficient PPE to provide dialysis in place, and sufficient support from local, regional, and national policy makers to implement dialysis-in-place policies. Given these trade-offs, on March 10, 2020 the CDC advised that hemodialysis could be performed on clinically stable patients in the outpatient dialysis setting, 10, 11 and, on March 26, 2020, the End-Stage Renal Disease Networks broadcast that \"COVID (+) patients who are stable need outpatient dialysis,\" emphasizing the critical importance of limiting hospital use to those who truly require hospitalization. Thus, we advocate that maintenance dialysis patients who are clinically stable receive dialysis in an outpatient setting.",

This is particularly notable given the current difficulty securing surgeon and operating room availability for peritoneal dialysis catheter placement, reflecting local interpretations that peritoneal dialysis access is not a priority procedure. In the near term, particularly should there be a lull in the current pandemic, rapidly increasing the use of home dialysis will be critical. 12 In this regard, the Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative, which promotes substantial increase in the prevalence of home dialysis, was prescient. 13 The ability to dialyze at home greatly reduces the risk for COVID-19 infection in both patients with kidney failure and the staff needed to care for them, thereby reducing the risk to the entire community.",

These services will almost certainly not be equipped with PPE and will not be able to safely transport PUIs or COVID-19-positive hemodialysis patients. Limited solutions exist, particularly for patients who do not have a car or do not have a family member who can reliably transport them to dialysis.

With the increased availability of testing, exposed health care workers with symptoms may be able to return Editorial to work more quickly in the setting of negative test results; however, with the rapid spread of COVID-19 infection in the United States, health care workers will be disproportionately affected.

This dependence not only increases the likelihood that hemodialysis patients will be infected with COVID-19 but also increases the risk to society, given the health care workers and transportation infrastructure needed to provide incenter hemodialysis. Several steps may help mitigate the current crisis: (1) making every effort to dialyze clinically stable in-center hemodialysis patients in outpatient dialysis facilities to reduce burdens on hospitals, (2) implementing screening, cohorting and isolation processes in hemodialysis facilities, (3) increasing COVID-19 testing in hemodialysis facilities, and (4) observing best PPE practices. However, critically, we as a kidney community need to reduce the vulnerability of patients with kidney disease to future outbreaks and reduce the risks that society faces when providing in-center hemodialysis patients with their life-saving dialysis sessions during a pandemic. The only way to accomplish this is to rapidly change the kidney care paradigm by improving nondialysis kidney care, increasing use of home dialysis and transplantation, and innovating such that in-center hemodialysis is replaced by new technologies that allow patients with kidney failure to live free of dialysis facilities.",
