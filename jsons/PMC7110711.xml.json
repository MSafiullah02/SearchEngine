The disease was initially reported in European and Asian pig industries over the last 30 years, with the virus first appearing in England (Wood, 1977) and Belgium (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978) in the early 1970s. Recently, PEDV has also been reported in the US (Stevenson et al., 2013). Since then, the virus has rapidly spread nationwide throughout the USA (Cima, 2013) and to other countries in North America, including Canada and Mexico. As a result of the significant impact of PEDV, the US pig industry has lost almost 10% of its domestic pig population after only a 1 year-epidemic period, amounting to approximately 7 million piglets.",

Bats are the projected host for the gene source of Alphacoronaviruses and Betacoronaviruses, while birds are the suspect host for Gammacoronaviruses and Deltacoronaviruses (Woo et al., 2012). In different US regions where PEDV is epidemic, a new coronavirus genetically distinct from PEDV, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), has been simultaneously (and frequently) detected in diarrheic fecal samples from pigs (Wang et al., 2014a). The clinical impact and disease severity of PDCoV in the field is reportedly less than that of PEDV. A recent study confirmed that PDCoV is enteropathogenic in pigs and acutely infects the small intestine, causing severe diarrhea and/or vomiting and atrophic enteritis, similar to the clinical signs of PEDV and TGEV infections (Jung et al., 2015). At present, differential diagnosis of PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV is critical to control viral epidemic diarrheas in US pig farms.",

Details of the PEDV structure and genome can be found elsewhere (Song and Park, 2012). PEDV has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb in size (excluding the poly A-tail) that encodes four structural proteins, namely, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) protein, and four nonstructural proteins: 1a, 1b, 3a, and 3b (Kocherhans et al., 2001). Among the viral proteins, the S protein is critical for regulating interactions with specific host cell receptor glycoproteins to mediate viral entry and for inducing neutralizing antibodies (Bosch et al., 2003). The S protein is also associated with growth adaptation in vitro and attenuation of PEDV virulence in vivo (Sato et al., 2011). The M protein is the most abundant component among viral proteins in the envelope and plays an important role in virus assembly by interacting with the S and N proteins (Klumperman et al, 1994, Vennema et al, 1996). The N protein of coronavirus binds RNA and packages viral genomic RNA into the nucleocapsid of virus particles (Spaan et al., 1983).",

However, a subsequent study found a detectable, two-way cross-reactivity between PEDV and FIPV by more sensitive assays, such as enzyme linked immune-sorbent assay, immunoblotting and immune-precipitation (Zhou et al., 1988). These discrepancies indicate that cross-reactivity between PEDV and other coronaviruses probably varies depending on the sensitivity of the techniques and the viral strains tested. A recent study reported evidence of antigenic cross-activity between the prototype CV777 and recent US PEDV strains and TGEV (Miller strain) by sharing at least one conserved epitope on the N-terminal region of their N proteins (Lin et al., 2015).",

Another African green monkey kidney cell line, MARC-145, also supported a subsequent cell passage of PEDV (Lawrence et al., 2014). Trypsin plays an important role in cell entry and release of PEDV virions in Vero cells, contributing to efficient replication and spread of the virus to neighboring cells in vitro (Shirato et al, 2011, Wicht et al, 2014). Trypsin resulted in the cleavage of the S protein into S1 and S2 subunits, which most likely accounts for cell-to-cell fusion and the release of virions from infected Vero cells (Shirato et al., 2011). Cytopathic effects consist of vacuolation and formation of syncytia as a result of apoptotic cell death (Hofmann, Wyler, 1988, Kim, Lee, 2014). The hemagglutinating activity of PEDV was demonstrated with rabbit erythrocytes only after trypsin treatment (Park et al., 2010).

That study also revealed a lack of LGR5+ cells and low proliferation of crypt cells (small expression of Ki67 protein in crypt cells) in the small intestine of nursing piglets (9-day-old) without PEDV infection, possibly causing the slow turnover of enterocytes. At 3\u20135 days after PEDV infection, however, the number of LGR5+ cells and proliferation of crypt cells were remarkably increased, leading to the replacement of necrotic enterocytes shed from infected villi. On the other hand, weaned pigs (3-week-old) without PEDV infection exhibited high proliferation of intestinal crypt cells and large numbers of LGR5+ cells in the crypts, relating to the rapid turnover rate of enterocytes. Large numbers of LGR5+ cells and high proliferation of crypt cells were maintained at 1\u20135 days after PEDV infection, possibly resulting in a rapid recovery from PED in weaned pigs.",

Unlike CDCD or gnotobiotic pigs, conventional nursing piglets inoculated with 3.2\u20133.3 log10 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of a Chinese PEDV strain had a longer incubation period (3\u20136 days after inoculation) before clinical signs were detected (Wang et al., 2013).",

During the outbreak in 1989, diarrhea was most severe in fattening pigs and pregnant sows, and was mild or absent in nursing and weaning pigs with no mortality. For at least 18 months after the onset of the first outbreak, PEDV became endemic on this farm and the infection persisted in seronegative gilts or 6\u201310-week-old pigs newly introduced to the farm. Another typical endemic PED has been manifested in Korean pig farms. Korean farms have employed live or inactivated PEDV vaccines using three Korean strains DR13, KPEDV-9 and SM98-1 or a Japanese strain P-5V. Studies reported that recent prevalent Korean PEDV field isolates are closely related to Chinese strains and differ genetically from the four vaccine strains used in Korea and the prototype CV777 (Park et al., 2013). This divergence of historic vaccine and recent field PEDV strains may contribute to the reduced efficacy of the vaccines, causing difficulty with eradication of PEDV from pig farms with endemic PED in the Korean pig population.",

The vaccinated sows and their piglets exhibited higher IgA (mucosal immunity) and virus neutralization antibody (humoral immunity) levels in the colostrum or sera compared to those of the counterparts administered the IM vaccine with the same dose. However, the presence of maternal antibodies in vaccinated pigs can interfere with active antibody production after PEDV infection, as observed in TGEV infection (Sestak et al, 1996, Saif et al, 2012). Whether the oral live vaccine strain is genetically stable and remains non-infectious in the fields needs to be further studied.",

Endemic PED is a significant problem, which is exacerbated by the emergence or potential importation of multiple PEDV variants into countries. Epidemic PEDV strains spread rapidly and cause a high number of pig deaths and substantial economic losses. These strains are highly enteropathogenic and acutely infect villous epithelial cells of the entire small and large intestines although the jejunum and ileum are the primary sites of infection. PEDV infections cause acute, severe atrophic enteritis accompanied by viremia (viral RNA) that leads to severe diarrhea and vomiting, followed by extensive dehydration and imbalanced blood electrolytes as the major cause of death in nursing piglets. A better understanding of the pathogenic characteristics of epidemic or endemic PEDV strains is needed to prevent and control the disease in affected regions and in the development of effective vaccine.",

In infected nursing piglets, there is an increased proliferation of crypt cells as well as numbers of LGR5+ crypt stem cells in the intestine, reorganization of the damaged intestinal epithelium, and migration of mature enterocytes to the tips of villi which may be not sufficient to prevent severe dehydration in nursing piglets. The time taken until dehydration of PEDV-infected nursing piglets in the field appears to be too short to enable the animals to recover from the disease through naturally occurring epithelial cell renewal by crypt stem cells. Further studies are needed to define the extent to which intestinal stem cells in nursing versus weaned pigs organize and migrate to replace PEDV-infected villous epithelial cells. Pharmacological or biological mediators such as epidermal growth factor that promote stem cell regeneration or maturation would be interesting targets to try to shorten the time for epithelial cell renewal and to reduce PEDV death losses from dehydration.",
