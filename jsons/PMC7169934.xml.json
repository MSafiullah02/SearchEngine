However, the clinic study did not discover desirable medicine. Therefore, more potential drug targets should be explored for virtual screening and drug design. As the whole process of viral disease involves not only the proteins encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 itself, but also the proteins of human being. Thus, both the viral protein and human protein should be included for drug discovery and development, and the virtual screening against more potential target proteins could reduce false negative and improve the success rate to quickly find cures for the disease. Moreover, multi-site docking is also indispensable for deep exploration of protein functions and drug discovery. On one hand, the functional sites of some proteins are unclear or not unique, which should be comprehensively considered. On the other hand, there may be allosteric sites on the protein, which may have distinct advantages for regulating protein function. In conclusion, multi-target and multi-site based virtual screening is a more expected and comprehensive approach for finding targeted therapeutic drugs, which can improve the accuracy and robustness of prediction as much as possible.",

For example, chloroquine, an anti-plasmodium drug, has been found partially effective in clinic. However, its exact target protein and function mechanism against the virus and COVID-19 are unknown. In addition, many groups are working on the cytopathic effect assay for discovering drugs or active compounds against the SARS-CoV-2. This kind of in vitro study may result in compounds with good activity yet unknown targets. Therefore, identifying potential drug targets will be of great importance to understand the underlying mechanism of how the drug works, and to provide information for further drug development. Thus, a platform is expected to provide reverse docking function for predicting target protein for mechanism unknown but active compounds and drugs.",

The details of the vsREMD method have been described in our previous study21. Briefly, in the vsREMD, a set of replicas are simulated in explicit solvent environment at different temperatures, but exchange between neighboring replicas solely utilizes the sum of intra-protein interaction (P\npp) and protein\u2013solvent interaction (PpwP\npw) as the criterion by Eq. (4):(4)\u03c9(1\u21942)=min(1,exp(\u0394\u03b2\u0394(Ppp+Ppw)))where \u03b2 is the inverse of temperature 1/k\nB\nT. To obtain the correct ensemble after exchange moves between replica 1 and replica 2, the vsREMD uses Eqs. (5), (6) below to rescale uniformly the velocities of all particles.(5)v\u02c6(1\u21922)=v(2)Ekin(1)\u2212\u0394PwwEkin(2)\n(6)v\u02c6(2\u21921)=v(1)Ekin(2)+\u0394PwwEkin(1)where v1 and Ekin1 are the velocities and kinetic energies of replica 1 before exchange, respectively; Pww is the intra-solvent interaction; v1\u21922 is the velocity of replica 1 after exchange.

As SARS-CoV-2 Mpro is a promising target6, we selected it as an example to demonstrate how we predict potential allosteric binding pockets. Based on the vsREMD simulation trajectories at 300 K, we applied D3Pockets to explore the dynamic properties of potential pockets in SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. As shown in Fig. 3\n, there are grid points colored from blue to red that compose a pocket. The redder the grid points are, the more stable the sub-pocket regions throughout the MD trajectory. Therefore, for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, four relatively stable pockets are observed (Fig. 3). Pocket 1, where the intrinsic ligand binds to, has more stable points than Pockets 2, 3, and 4. Pocket 2, which is far from Pocket 1, has a positive volume correlation (0.60) with Pocket 1 (substrate binding site), suggesting that when Pocket 1 gets bigger, Pocket 2 gets bigger as well (Fig. 4\nA). Similarly, Pocket 3 also has a positive volume correlation (0.69) with Pocket 1 (Fig. 4B). There is no correlation between Pockets 1 and 4. It is well known that a pocket with strong correlation with the substrate binding pocket could be used as an allosteric site for drug discovery and development30, 31, 32. Therefore, Pockets 2 and 3 are two potential allosteric binding pockets, which were included in the D3Targets-2019-nCoV webserver. The cutoff of correlation coefficient to identify the allosteric binding pockets was set to 0.5 by default with the program D3Pockets20.",

The abundant conformations and binding pockets make the webserver much possible to successfully predict target proteins and to discover hit compounds. It is also important to notice that other reverse docking platforms should be tried as the true targets of an active compound may not be included in D3Targets-2019-nCoV due to the unknown pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19. Because the protein conformation obtained by homology modelling may not be the most stable conformation, and some docking models still need further optimization, for example, the positions of two Mg2+ on the RdRp, the workflow of D3Targets-2019-nCoV needs to be further improved.",

Therefore, we strongly recommend that the users take into account the docked binding mode and docking scores together with protein function. The D3Targets-2019-nCoV webserver will keep regularly update when the new structures of potential target proteins related to COVID-19 are available and meet one of the 4 criteria, viz., natural mutant, RMSDs of the overall structure or ligand binding pockets or any key residue in the pockets \u22652 \u00c5 to any structures in the webserver.",

Although there is no effective drug approved, many clinical trials are incoming or ongoing in China. Moreover, many groups are working on the cytopathic effect assay for discovering active compound. In many cases, the target protein of the discovered active compounds might be unknown. Therefore, identifying potential drug targets will be of great importance. Here, we developed a webserver for predicting potential target protein for active compounds and for virtual screening against multi-target and multi-pockets. The webserver database currently has 42 proteins (20 viral proteins and 22 human proteins related to virus infection, replication and release) with 69 conformations collected by means of downloading directly from PDB, homology and de novo modeling, and the MD simulation. With the program D3Pockets, 557 potentla ligand binding pockets were successfully predicted and used for molecular docking by the server. Each submitted compound will be docked to all the binding pockets by smina, and the docking results will be presented in ascending order of docking score. Tests with 6 active compounds/drugs with experimental reported target proteins and bioactivity data demonstrated the potential usefulness of the D3Targets-2019-nCoV server.
