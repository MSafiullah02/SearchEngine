Although vaccine development has been almost exclusively focused on eliciting a humoral immune response in the host through inoculation with whole protein antigen [51], [69], [59], [29], CTL peptide vaccines producing a T-cell response may offer an important alternative approach [23]. For HIV and EBOV and influenza in particular, the potential of CTL vaccines has been discussed [21], [7], [56]. Although computational prediction alone has been used for T-cell vaccine design [2], [14], we saw a unique opportunity to see if a preventative EBOV T-cell vaccine could be successfully designed based on the specific epitopes targeted by survivors of documented EBOV infection.",

These include peptides from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) RGYVYQGL [68], and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RGPGRAFVTI [5]. The existence of such epitopes makes a range of pre-clinical vaccine experiments possible without having to rely on non-human primates and expensive and complex-to-manage humanized mouse models. Wilson et al. showed that the EBOV nucleoprotein (NP) is an immunogen that provides protective, CTL-mediated immunity against EBOV in a C57BL/6 mouse model and that this protection was conferred by a peptide sequence within Ebola Zaire: NP43-53 (VYQVNNLEEIC) [73]. Wilson et al. came to this conclusion based on studying splenocytes harvested from mice vaccinated with Ebola Zaire NP using a Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) vector. Their experiments showed that splenocytes from the vaccinated mice re-stimulated with NP43-53 had high levels of cytotoxic activity against target cells loaded with the EBOV NP peptide. Remarkably, NP43-53 also happens to be an 11 amino acid sub-sequence of the epitope identified by Sakebe et al. as most commonly favored for T-cell attack by survivors of the 2013-2016 EBOV outbreak in West Africa.",

These sequences are shown in Table 1\n. We then vaccinated, via intradermal (tail) injection, three groups of mice with microspheres containing one of the three 9mer sub-sequences of NP43-53 (6 per group). ELISPOT analysis was performed, stimulating harvested splenocytes with the three possible 9mer sub-sequences. Splenocytes from mice receiving the NP44-52 sub-sequence had a statistically higher ELISPOT response than mice vaccinated with the other two possible sub-sequence 9mers (P < 0.0001) as shown in Fig. 1a.

However, observations derived from individuals able to control HIV infection [43] and EBOV infection [50] demonstrating that control may be associated with specific CTL targeting behavior, suggest that there may be an important role for HLA-restricted peptide vaccines for protection against infectious disease for which development of an effective traditional whole protein vaccine has proved to be difficult.

Interaction of EBOV specific antibody, NHP lung tissue and EBOV delivered to NHPs via aerosol can produce a more lethal effect than in NHPs without circulating anti-EBOV antibody exposed to aerosolized EBOV (unpublished conference presentation). This suggests that a CTL vaccine may be more effective for prophylaxis against filovirus protection than an antibody vaccine if the anticipated route of EBOV exposure is via aerosol.",

The A\u221730 supertype is relatively common in West Africa: 13.3% for Mali, 15.4% for Kenya, 16.3% for Uganda, and 23.9% for Mozambique [32]. Although peptide vaccines are by their nature HLA restricted, it may be possible to create a CTL vaccine directed against EBOV for use alone or in conjunction with a whole protein vaccine to produce an antibody response in tandem, by incorporating additional Class I peptides from epitopes targeted by controllers to broaden the HLA coverage of the vaccine. MHC binding algorithms hosted by the IEDB predict that YQVNNLEEI will bind strongly to the MHC of HLA-A\u221702:06, HLA-A\u221702:03 and HLA-A\u221702:01 individuals (Supplementary Material Table 2) [65]. HLA-DR binding database analysis also suggests that VKNEVNSFKAALSSLAKHG demonstrates sufficiently promiscuous binding characteristics cover that same population (Supplementary Material Table 4) [65]. Taken together, a peptide vaccine based on YQVNNLEEI and VKNEVNSFKAALSSLAKHG could produce a cellular immune response in about 50% of the population of the Sudan and about 30% of the population of North America.",

[42] This suggests that the same approach could be applied to SARS-CoV-2 which has conserved regions in nucleocapsid which is located within the virus (see multiple sequence alignment in Supplementary Material Fig. 7 and Supplementary Material Fig. 8). Antigenic escape allows a virus to retain fitness despite an immune response to vaccination [20]. Picking conserved regions for vaccine targeting is an important part of mitigating this problem. Coronavirus spike protein, for example, may be particularly susceptible to mutation meaning that antigenic escape would be likely if the spike protein was targeted by a coronavirus vaccine, making it difficult to achieve durable protection. [74] A recent paper conducted a population genetic analysis of 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes showing that the virus has evolved into two major types: L and S, with changes in their relative frequency after the outbreak possibly due to human intervention resulting in selection pressure [62].",

ELISPOT analysis of PBMCs taken from the peripheral blood of COVID-19 controllers and progressors to assess the presence of a differential response to the 53 peptides could lead to a broadly applicable protective CTL vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 by incorporating peptides into the vaccine that are more commonly targeted for CD8+ attack by the controllers versus the progressors. A peptide vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, unlike a typical antibody vaccine, is not limited to virus surface antigen targets. This provides opportunities to attack other targets on SARS-CoV-2 besides spike which may be prone to mutation [74].",

Also, neutralizing antibodies directed against spike protein in SARS-CoV-1 patients have been associated with an increased risk of Acute Lung Injury (ALI)[35]. Specifically, patients succumbing to SARS-CoV-1 were found to develop a neutralizing antibody (NAb) response to spike protein faster than survivors after the onset of symptoms and the NAb titers were higher in the patients who died compared with those who recovered[76]. To the extent to which antibody vaccines producing an antibody response against the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 could increase the risk of ALI, this risk could also be mitigated by a using peptide vaccine as an alternative approach.",

If researchers act now during the COVID-19 outbreak, perhaps controller and progressor blood samples could be collected and prospectively analyzed, quickly creating a database of optimal candidate class I peptides for inclusion into a CTL vaccine with potentially broad HLA coverage for subsequent rapid manufacture and deployment. It would be interesting to see the extent to which the peptides favored by controllers appear on SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid, making SARS-CoV-2 a second example, across two different viruses, of controllers exhibiting CTL attack preferentially on the nucleocapsid protein.",
