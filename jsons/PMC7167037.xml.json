            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are common respiratory diseases that continue to pose a threat to public health. According to a report published by the World Health Organization, lower respiratory infections killed 3 million people and are the most deadly communicable disease, causing 3 million deaths worldwide in 2016 (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/index.html). More than 200 viruses are major etiological agents of ARIs. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumoviruses (hMPVs), and human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) that are classified into the subfamilies Pneumovirinae and Paramyxovirinae and the Paramyxoviridae has a nonsegmented, single\u2010stranded, negative\u2010sense RNA genome,1 which was the common causative agents of ARIs in humans in all age groups.2, 3, 4, 5 These viruses can cause acute respiratory diseases such as croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in children, the elderly, and immunodeficiency patients. RSV has two subtypes, subtype A and B, which play an important role in most respiratory infections and account for 60% to 80% of cases of bronchiolitis in children under 2 years of age. Followed by RSV, 5% to 15% of children with respiratory infections were hospitalized for bronchiolitis caused by hMPV.6, 7 HPIVs have four subtypes including HPIV\u20101, HPIV\u20102, HPIV\u20103, and HPIV\u20104; HPIV\u20104 is considered less important. HPIV\u20101, HPIV\u20102, and HPIV\u20103 are prevalent in acute respiratory infections in children under 5 years and may account for 17% of hospitalizations.5 RSV, hMPV, and HPIV infections can cause fever, cough, hypoxia, and severe symptoms such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia.4, 8, 9 Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish between RSV, hMPV, and HPIV infections, and accurate early diagnosis based on clinical manifestations is a serious challenge.10\n",

It is widely used to detect respiratory viruses and provides an effective solution for early detection.12, 13 Compared with traditional virus culture and immunofluorescence detection methods, real\u2010time PCR has the advantages of high sensitivity, short turnaround time, and simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens. Unlike monoplex real\u2010time PCR, multiplex real\u2010time PCR allows multiple pathogens to be detected simultaneously in a single reaction, thus having the advantage of time savings and cost\u2010effective.7, 14 At present, several monoplex or multiplex real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR methods for hMPV, RSV, and HPIVs detection have been established. However, these techniques do not involve the simultaneous detection of all common respiratory paramyxoviruses (especially hMPV), and their performance and clinical evaluation are few. Here, we developed a one\u2010step two\u2010tube triplex real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay and assessed its sensitivity and specificity for hMPV, RSV\u2010A, RSV\u2010B, HPIV\u20101, HPIV\u20102, and HPIV\u20103. This new method was used to detect these viruses in 471 hospitalized patients with ARIs, and its performance was compared with a commercial routine multiplex\u2010ligation\u2010NAT\u2010based RespiFinder\u201022 (RF\u201022; PathoFinder, Maastricht, The Netherlands).",

Moreover, we compared the performance of our real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR assay with an in\u2010house monoplex real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR and a commercial 2Smart kit for detection of human paramyxoviruses in clinical settings. The consistency results and superior sensitivity of several pathogens indicated that the methods we developed had application potential in clinical samples. Our study had limitations that the small sample size of our study hindered our ability to accurately assess the seasonality of the pathogens included in our study. Nonetheless, our results suggested that human paramyxoviruses were more commonly detected during Autumn and Winter.",

Second, our method provides a new approach with a higher quality of performance (accuracy, speed, and higher sensitivity) for the detection of common respiratory paramyxoviruses in clinical settings. This two\u2010tube triplex real\u2010time PCR assay provides several advantages. It is more specimen\u2010 and time\u2010saving and more cost\u2010effective, without compromising quality, compared with monoplex real\u2010time RT\u2010PCR and commercial routine multiplex\u2010ligation\u2010NAT\u2010based RF\u201022.",
