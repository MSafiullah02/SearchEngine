Novel technologies show the existence of a staggering number of individual lipid species, the biological functions of which are, with the exception of only a few lipid species, unknown. Much can be learned from pathogens that have evolved to take advantage of the complexity of the lipidome to escape the immune system of the host organism and to allow their survival and replication. Different types of pathogens target different lipids as shown in interaction maps, allowing visualization of differences between different types of pathogens. Bacterial and viral pathogens target predominantly structural and signaling lipids to alter the cellular phenotype of the host cell. Fungal and parasitic pathogens have complex lipidomes themselves and target predominantly the release of polyunsaturated fatty acids from the host cell lipidome, resulting in the generation of eicosanoids by either the host cell or the pathogen. Thus, whereas viruses and bacteria induce predominantly alterations in lipid metabolites at the host cell level, eukaryotic pathogens focus on interference with lipid metabolites affecting systemic inflammatory reactions that are part of the immune system.

The metabolites in both databases include water-soluble and water-insoluble or lipid metabolites. The analysis of lipid metabolites by mass spectrometry poses additional requirements and constraints to the experiments due to their inherent hydrophobic nature. Lipids must first be extracted using a procedure that involves phase separation into a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic phase. In addition, mass spectrometry analyses require that the hydrophobic lipids must be charged prior to MS analysis. This only became routine with the advent of electrospray-mass spectrometry in the late 1980s (5, 6) . Hence, metabolomic analyses often refer to the water-soluble metabolome whereas lipidomic analyses refer (by definition) to water-insoluble analyses.

Single-stranded genomes are then designated as positive-strand (+RNA), i.e. containing directly translatable information like mRNA, or negative-strand (\u2212RNA). Viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens and require host cells in order to replicate. A viral replication cycle basically comprises the following steps: receptor binding (attachment to the host cell), cell entry (often via endocytosis), uncoating (release of the viral genome into the cell), genome replication, virion assembly (packaging of new genomes into virus particles), and virus release (by budding or cell lysis). Viruses can interact with the host lipidome in two ways, namely by exploiting pre-existing molecules or by actively altering host lipid metabolism.

The pathways and lipids exploited by viruses span the entire cellular repertoire. Despite this large degree of variation, cholesterol (category E) appears to be important for the entry of many different viruses (see e.g. 22, 107) . The most straightforward explanation is the fundamental importance of cholesterol for the organization of membranes and the functioning of endocytic pathways. Fatty acids (FAs, category A) have been implicated in the replication of many different viruses. VACV was reported to rely on the synthesis and mitochondrial import of FAs and on \u03b2-oxidation for ATP production (69) . Many +RNA viruses use FAs to synthesize lipids to build their replication organelles. PV was reported to enhance uptake and prevent routing of FAs to lipid droplets (64), whereas DENV recruited FAS to its replication organelles and increased the activity of the enzyme to ensure high amounts of local FA synthesis (66) . Also other viruses, e.g. WNV, require FAS activity, as their replication is inhibited by FAS inhibitors (59) . Furthermore, the cellular energy regulator AMPK, which is an inhibitor of FAS, restricted infection of a number of unrelated viruses including the -RNA virus Rift Valley Fever Virus (68) and HCV. At least HCV actively counteracts this restrictive mechanism by inactivating AMPK (112) . Finally, not only the amount of FAs may be important, but also chain length and saturation. PV specifically enhances the uptake of long chain FAs (64) and the replication of HCV and the integrity of its membranous web depend on the enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, which converts the saturated FA stearate into the mono-unsaturated FA oleate (113) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 402, "end": 405, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 406, "end": 410, "text": "107)", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 782, "end": 786, "text": "(69)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1103, "end": 1107, "text": "(66)", "ref_id": "BIBREF66"}, {"start": 1214, "end": 1218, "text": "(59)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1407, "text": "(68)", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1504, "text": "(112)", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 1653, "end": 1657, "text": "(64)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1850, "end": 1855, "text": "(113)", "ref_id": "BIBREF113"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Viral entry"}, {"text": "Recently, PI(4)P (category C) and the PI(4)P-synthesizing enzymes PI4KIII\u03b1 and PI4KIII\u03b2 have been shown to play a pivotal role in +RNA virus replication.

PI4KIII\u03b1 activity was shown to be important for the integrity of the membranous web and the PI(4)P levels affect the phosphorylation status of one of the viral proteins (NS5A), thereby influencing the process of viral RNA replication (40, 44) . Enteroviruses (e.g. PV, Coxsackievirus B3 and most probably also the other enteroviruses) on the other hand rely on PI4KIII\u03b2 for a PI(4)P-rich environment in their replication organelles (37, 116, 117) . It has been suggested that the PI(4)P-rich environment attracts the viral polymerase to the replication organelles to replicate the viral RNA (37) . A new role of PI(4)P in infection was recently uncovered for both HCV and enteroviruses, being the recruitment of oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) to the replication organelles (60,63) (see below).

Thus, fungi do not typically enter the host cell but affect host lipid metabolism by extracellular secretion of factors. Indeed, fungi are rich sources for molecules that interact with the lipid metabolism of mammals. Particularly, well studied are molecules that interfere with various steps in the synthesis of sphingolipids because of their applicability in fundamental research and cancer therapy (186, 187) . Sphingolipids are key molecules in protein trafficking, lipid homeostasis and cell differentiation and their balanced occurrence is essential. Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzes the first, committing-and rate limiting step in sphingolipid de novo synthesis. Sphingofungins, lipoxamycin and myriocin are fungal structural analogs of the SPT intermediate-or end products with potent and highly selective inhibitory activities (188, 189) . Also subsequent steps in the synthesis of the sphingolipid backbone are efficiently inhibited by fungal metabolites: ceramide synthase is sensitive to Fumonisins (isolated from Fusarium verticillioides), AAL-toxin (Alternaria alternata) and Australifungins (nonpathogenic Sporormiella australis) (190) (191) (192) . It is interesting to note that all these fungi-derived molecules interfere with early steps in sphingolipid synthesis, i.e. prior to the synthesis of sphingomyelin in host cells ( Figure 2C ). This is probably related to the fact that after the synthesis of (dihydro-)ceramide, the fungal-and mammalian anabolic metabolism of phosphosphingolipids diverge. Whereas mammals synthesize SM, fungi use inositol as an headgroup, leading to inositol phosphorylceramide (IPC), which plays a crucial role in pathogenesis of Cryptococcus neoformans (193, 194) .

Enzymatic oxidation of arachidonic acid is achieved by the actions of either lipo-oxygenases, cyclooxigenases or CYP enzymes, but also nonenzymatic reactions (lipid peroxidation) can lead to the formation of bioactive arachidonic acid metabolites known as isoprostanes (196) .

The different types of microbial pathogens do so in a very different way. Simple (unicellular and prokaryotic) microbial pathogens such as bacteria target host cell lipids that are generally not synthesized by bacteria. These include structural membrane lipids such as cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine as well as signaling lipids such as phosphoinositides and sphingomyelin. In addition, they target neutral lipids for fatty acid production for a variety of functions. In broad outlines, viruses and bacteria target the same group of lipids (compare Figure 2A and B) with one notable exception: whereas several viruses target PS in the host cells, this is only sporadically reported for bacteria. The complex eukaryotic microbial pathogens, fungi and parasites, interact with the host cell lipidome in a very different way as compared to bacteria and viruses (compare Figure 2C and D with Figure 2A and B). The most notable differences between 'simple' and 'complex' microbial pathogens are (i) the lack of cholesterol and signaling lipid (phosphoinositides and sphingomyelin) targeting by fungi and parasites; and (ii) the abundant targeting of the eicosanoid pathways in the host cells by fungi and parasites, often dealing with systemic inflammations in the host organism.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 196, "end": 200, "text": "(28)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 756, "end": 765, "text": "Figure 2A", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1083, "text": "Figure 2C", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1095, "end": 1104, "text": "Figure 2A", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Conclusions and Outlook"}, {"text": "All pathogens target the PC, PE, diacylglycerol and TAG area of the metabolic map ( Figure 2 ).

TAG species generally contain saturated and mono/di unsaturated fatty acids with an average chain length of 16-18 carbon atoms. In contrast, PC and PE will contain mostly long chain (C20-C24) PUFAs at the sn-2 position.

Novel lipidomic technologies are rapidly being created and implemented such as Imaging mass spectrometry and single cell metabolomics/lipidomics. High-resolution mass spectrometry will allow precise annotation of lipid species and combined with automated high-throughput analysis and novel bioinformatics tools, we will soon witness the generation of enormous amounts of high density data allowing spatiotemporal resolution of the involvement of lipids in host-pathogen interactions.
