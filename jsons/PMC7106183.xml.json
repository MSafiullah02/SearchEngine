CCoV-I strains were identified in the beginning of the 2000s, when Pratelli and coworkers highlighted that FCoV-like CCoV strains, that share high homology with FCoVs, are circulating in canine population (Pratelli et al., 2001a, Pratelli et al., 2002). Recently, CCoV-II genotype was divided in two subtypes, CCoV-IIa (classical strains) and CCoV-IIb (TGEV-like strains), with CCoV-IIb emerging as a result of a putative recombination between CCoV-II and TGEV (Decaro et al., 2009, Decaro et al., 2010).",

Feces are usually loose to watery and they may contain mucus or blood. Younger dogs are more severely affected. Mild disease or asymptomatic carriage are probably in many cases common outcomes of infection. Clinical signs are usually mild and the disease is highly contagious with low mortality rate (Appel et al., 1979, Carmichael and Binn, 1981).",

One possible explanation of the difference is the close contact of the animals, the fecal-oral transmission of the disease and the long-term viral shedding. As it has been suggested, dogs may be contagious for a period varying from 2 weeks to several months (Keenan et al., 1976, Pratelli et al., 2001a, Pratelli et al., 2001b), highly contaminating their environment. Likewise, similar differences between singly and group housed dogs have been identified in previous studies, by means of serological assays (Naylor et al., 2001, Rimmelzwaan et al., 1991).",

In the present study, CCoV was more frequently detected in dogs younger than 3 months old than in dogs of at least 3 months of age. Puppies usually become susceptible after the decline of the maternally derived antibodies, which last for a period of 4\u20135 weeks (Appel, 1987). In contrast, older animals appear to be less susceptible, due to acquired immunity, occurring as a result of prior exposure to the pathogen. In the present study, the oldest animal tested positive was a 12 year old dog. The results indicate that CCoV is more widespread in puppies, though older animals can also be presented with a coronaviral infection.",

It was shown, that there were strains either detected (4/206) or characterized (8/134 CCoV-I, 7/134 CCoV-II) only by real time RT-PCR, as it was expected, since these assays have higher sensitivity compared to the RT-PCR assays (Decaro et al., 2004, Decaro et al., 2005). However, in the present study some of the strains were either detected (2/206) or characterized (2/134 CCoV-I, 7/134 CCoV-II) only by RT-PCR assays, which may be explained by the fact that the assays amplify different parts of the genome. Since coronavirus mutation rates are considered to be high due to the infidelity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Woo et al., 2009), false-negative results are expected, when either primers or probes lack the ability to anneal. It is obvious that the results may be more reliable by using both assays, since no assay has been demonstrated to represent the gold standard for the identification and characterization of CCoV.",

Recently, it was suggested that CCoV-I represents a possible parental biotype of CCoV-IIa (Lorusso et al., 2008). If this is the case, the genome of CCoV-IIa is being subjected to the evolutionary pressure of the host immune system for a shorter period of time, with respect to the CCoV-I genome. This fact makes tempting to assume that the higher homogeneity of the CCoV-IIa strains\u2019 genome may be attributed to the shorter circulation time, with respect to strains of type I. Sequence analysis of more CCoV-I strains, coming from different geographic regions may help acquire more information regarding their variability, since so far only few CCoV-I strains have been analyzed.",
