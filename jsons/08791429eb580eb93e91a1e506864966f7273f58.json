The four dengue virus serotypes belong to the family of Flaviviridae and are genetically distinct but still closely related. Infection with any of the four dengue virus serotypes may be asymptomatic or may result in clinical manifestations ranging from a mild undifferentiated febrile syndrome to severe dengue. Severe dengue is characterized by plasma leakage, hemorrhagic tendencies, organ failure, shock, and, occasionally, death [5] . Patients with a second dengue infection with a dengue serotype different from the first are at increased risk for severe dengue. The hallmark of severe dengue is capillary leakage leading to shock and, if not managed well, death. The pathomechanism of severe dengue is still poorly understood, although the most plausible hypothesis is antibody-dependent enhancement in secondary infections [6] . Because effective vector-control measures are not scalable or sustainable, community-based approaches have led to mixed results [7, 8] , and promising novel strategies such as Wolbachia are still under development [9] , a dengue vaccine would appear to be the best intervention. The purpose of this review is to elaborate on the first licensed dengue vaccine and review second-generation dengue vaccines, both in the context of endemic populations as well as international travelers.",

The incidence of dengue has increased greatly, with the number of cases more than doubling every decade, from 8.3 million (3.3-17.2 million) apparent cases in 1990 to 58.4 million (23.6-121.9 million) apparent cases in 2013, responsible for 1.14 million disability-adjusted life-years [10] . In dengueendemic countries, approximately 10% of febrile episodes in children and adolescents are due to dengue, with a higher incidence in Asia (4.6 episodes per 100 person-years) compared to Latin America (2.9 episodes per 100 person-years); the percentage of dengue infections requiring hospitalization was 19% in Asia versus 11% in Latin America [11] . Many dengue infections lead to hospitalizations, which can overwhelm weak health care structures, in particular during times of outbreaks. Given the unpredictability of outbreaks, the increasing magnitude and frequency of such outbreaks, and the current lack of highly effective and sustainable vector-control interventions, there is a clear indication for a dengue vaccine for endemic populations.",

One challenge is the lack of an appropriate animal model and poor knowledge of correlates, both for protection and disease enhancement [12] . But the biggest hurdle is the interaction among the four serotypes. As a tetravalent immune response is desired, when a mixture of all four serotypes in a tetravalent live attenuated vaccine is given, each component would need to independently result in four different monotypic immune responses that are solid to each serotype. This has, unfortunately, proven to be difficult to achieve.",

Phase 3 trials revealed a vaccine efficacy that depended on age, serostatus, and serotype but also showed a population-level benefit [13] . Interference manifested by asymmetric immunological responses to the mixtures of four dengue vaccine viruses was recognized as a possible reason for this varied vaccine performance [14] . Post hoc retrospective analyses of the long-term safety data using a novel nonstructural protein (NS1) antibody assay revealed an excess risk of severe dengue in those who were seronegative at baseline, which means those who were dengue-na\u00efve at the time of administration of the first dose [15] . This increased risk was observed starting from 30 months after administration of the first dose. The reasons for the excess cases are not fully understood, but a plausible hypothesis is that Dengvaxia may trigger an immune response to dengue in seronegative persons that predisposes them to a higher risk of severe disease, analogous to what is seen in natural secondary dengue infections. In other words, it is plausible that Dengvaxia results in a \"primary-like\" silent infection (which live attenuated vaccines often elicit) [16] . A subsequent infection with the first true wild-type dengue virus would then be a \"secondary-like\", clinically more severe dengue illness. It is not the vaccine itself that causes excess cases, but rather the vaccine's induction of an immune status that increases the risk that subsequent infections will be more severe.",

The media release resulted in a major public outcry in the Philippines, with heightened anxiety and lack of confidence around vaccines in general [17] , which led to the subsequent resurgence of measles in the Philippines, reflecting the global resurgence of measles [18] [19] [20] .

The difference from Dengvaxia, therefore, is the presence of nonstructural (NS) proteins due to the DENV2 backbone. The conserved NS proteins within the dengue backbone may well be required to generate T-cell-mediated responses to dengue infection, and antibodies against NS1 are associated with cross-protective humoral immune responses [25] . This vaccine has performed well in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials, with high titers of neutralizing antibody to all four serotypes in nonhuman primates and humans, including cross-reactive T-cellmediated responses that may be necessary for broad protection against dengue fever [25, 26] . The vaccine efficacy is currently being tested in approximately 20,000 recipients in phase 3 trials in Asia and Latin America using a twodose regimen given 3 months apart. Efficacy data for the first 18 months are imminent.",

After decades of research, the first dengue vaccine was licensed in 2015: CYD-TDV, a tetravalent live attenuated vaccine with a yellow fever vaccine backbone. Recent analyses have shown that vaccine performance is dependent on serostatus. In those who have had a previous dengue infection, i.e., who are seropositive, the efficacy is high and the vaccine is safe. However, in seronegative vaccinees, approximately 3 years after vaccination the vaccine increases the risk of developing severe dengue when the individual experiences a natural dengue infection. The World Health Organization recommends that this vaccine be administered only to seropositive individuals. Current efforts are underway to develop rapid diagnostic tests to facilitate prevaccination screening. Two second-generation dengue vaccine candidates, both also live attenuated recombinant vaccines in late-stage development, may not present the same limitations because of differences in the backbone used, but results of phase 3 trials need to be available before firm conclusions can be drawn. Dengue is increasingly frequent in travelers, but the only licensed dengue vaccine to date can be used only in seropositive individuals. However, the vast majority of travelers are seronegative. Furthermore, the primary series of three doses given 6 months apart renders this vaccine difficult in the travel medicine context.",

Nach jahrzehntelanger Forschung wurde 2015 der erste Impfstoff gegen Dengue-Fieber zugelassen: CYD-TDV, ein tetravalenter, attenuierter Lebendimpfstoff auf Basis des Gelbfieber-Impfvirus (\"backbone\"). Neuste Analysen haben gezeigt, dass die Performance des Impfstoffs vom Serostatus abh\u00e4ngig ist. Bei Menschen, die bereits eine Dengue-Infektion hatten und seropositiv sind, ist die Wirksamkeit hoch und der Impfstoff sicher. Bei seronegativen Impflingen erh\u00f6ht der Impfstoff jedoch im Fall einer nachfolgenden Dengue-Wildvirusinfektion das Risiko f\u00fcr eine schwere Dengue-Erkrankung etwa 3 Jahre nach der Impfung. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation empfiehlt daher, den Impfstoff nur an seropositive Menschen zu verabreichen. Derzeit wird intensiv an der Entwicklung von Schnelltests gearbeitet, um das Screening vor der Impfung zu erleichtern. Zwei Dengue-Impfstoffkandidaten der zweiten Generation, beide ebenfalls attenuierte rekombinante Lebendimpfstoffe, befinden sich in der Sp\u00e4tphase der Entwicklungspipeline und k\u00f6nnten aufgrund der Unterschiede der verwendeten \"backbones\" nicht dieselben Limitierungen aufweisen; es m\u00fcssen aber die Ergebnisse der Phase-3-Studien abgewartet werden, um dies sicher beurteilen zu k\u00f6nnen. Dengue-Fieber tritt immer h\u00e4ufiger bei Reisenden auf. Die \u00fcberwiegende Mehrheit der Reisenden ist jedoch seronegativ, weshalb bei ihnen der bisher einzige zugelassene Impfstoff gegen Dengue-Fieber nicht eingesetzt werden kann. Dar\u00fcber hinaus sind f\u00fcr die Grundimmunisierung drei Impfdosen nach dem Schema 0-6-12 Monate erforderlich, wodurch der Einsatz dieses Impfstoffes im reisemedizinischen Kontext schwierig ist.",

Furthermore, dengue vaccines would be indicated for international travelers, in particular those who have already had one primary infection in order to reduce the risk of severe dengue as a result of a second infection during repeat travel. The second-generation dengue vaccines may overcome some of the shortcomings of the first licensed dengue vaccine; however, these vaccines will not be available for at least another couple of years. Phase 3 efficacy trials of second-generation dengue vaccines need to be analyzed and stratified by serostatus, and longterm data of at least 3 years following the first dose should be available before such vaccines are licensed. A safe and efficacious vaccine that can be used regardless of serostatus would enhance the use of a dengue vaccine in travelers.",
