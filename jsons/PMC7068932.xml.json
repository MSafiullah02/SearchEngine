In addition, one questionnaire on the incidence of complications (defined in additional file 1) [12] and another questionnaire on the availability of medications and equipment (based on the ISSPA) were designed to compensate for data that were lacking from the recording charts [13].

One reason for this high proportion is that the tools and materials for epidural anesthesia were unavailable, and a large number of abdominal operations were performed under general anesthesia. This finding also indicates that with continuous medical assistance and technical support, the drugs and instruments required for general anesthesia are basically guaranteed, and general anesthesia is becoming a routine anesthesia service. However, we also found that the concept of balanced anesthesia had not been implemented, and no regional block with sedative or analgesic measures was performed. This may have been due to the difficulty in obtaining drugs such as dexmedetomidine or midazolam. However, it also indicates that the anesthesia service provider was limited in his or her ability to implement the concept of comfortable anesthesia on the basis of ensuring the safety of anesthesia.",

Still, age-related diseases such as ischemic heart disease, stroke, and lower respiratory tract infections are the main causes of death in Cambodia [26]. Under the limited conditions of this country, the aging population poses a great challenge to anesthesia safety. First, there were difficulties in preoperative evaluation. In this survey, we often encountered missing and inadequate medical records and difficulty in acquiring patients\u2019 medical history. Even when the disease had been clearly diagnosed, the treatment was often unstandardized. Second, to balance the medical expenses, doctors often had to omit some examinations such as 24-h dynamic ECG, pulmonary function tests, or coronary angiography tests; thus, some occult diseases could not be diagnosed before surgery. Third, inadequate intraoperative monitoring and poor control of the intraoperative anesthesia depth, which relied solely on oxygen saturation and noninvasive blood pressure monitoring, prevented the detection of problems during the operation in a timely and effective manner and thus increased the risk of perioperative complications in patients of advanced age.",

Because of limited resources, early medical assistants generally performed general anesthesia under the monitoring of oxygen saturation [7]. This method may have resulted in the formation of habits among local anesthesiologists through years of inheritance. Because most of the surgeries in our survey were minor surgeries, a simple pulse oximeter can monitor the blood oxygen saturation of patients during surgery. However, in an emergency such as an allergic reaction, pulse oximetry may miss the best time for rescue, resulting in serious consequences such as death. Our study emphasizes the importance of ensuring the availability of basic monitoring and rescue equipment to improve the level of anesthesia safety. Acquisition of an ECG monitor, end-tidal carbon dioxide monitor, blood gas analyzer, and defibrillator in the operating room can greatly increase the safety of anesthesia. Based on the rational allocation of basic equipment and drugs, a regional anesthesia safety management team should then be established to conduct anesthesia quality control. Reporting of severe adverse events, regular anesthesia safety quality inspections, and personnel training are important measures to effectively improve anesthesia safety [26].",

Especially for some surgical services performed on excellent-quality professional medical ships, the overall incidence of anesthesia-related complications and postoperative complications approached the level in developed countries [28]. However, these medical assistance actions have not fundamentally promoted the quality of medical services in developing countries. Donation of medical equipment and medications is another common form of assistance that can quickly improve the treatment capacity of medical institutions. However, there are still problems with maintenance of the equipment [29]. The present investigation revealed that the anesthesia machine in the operating room had air leakage problems that could not be repaired, which poses a great danger to the implementation of general anesthesia. We also found that the basic equipment and medications that affect the safety of anesthesia are still largely missing, necessitating continued medical assistance. Finally, in conducting this survey, we fully understood the local anesthesiologists\u2019 desire for knowledge. Young anesthesiologists, who have received a Cambodia medical education based on western education system, with the same training time and courses as western medical education, are especially skilled at using the Internet and are very interested in new techniques such as ultrasound-guided nerve block. However, they tend to pay more attention to advanced anesthesia technologies than the progress in anesthesia guidelines, and it is worthy of the attention of future medical assistance teams.",

According to the records from the Cambodian Society of Anesthesia Critical Care and Emergency Medicine [30], anesthesiologists at Preah Ket Mealea Hospital tend to have better education and training experience than anesthesiologists in other hospitals, and the patient population they serve is larger than that of other hospitals. Second, we should also recognize that Cambodia still faces a critical shortage of medical resources and has a huge gap between urban and rural medical services [31]; therefore, the results of this study can only reflect the level of anesthesia services in the cities. Third, the sample size was too small to make firm conclusions on the safety of anesthesia practice for rare events such as death [4]. Because of missing data records, the incidence of anesthesia-related complications was obtained through questionnaires rather than from records. Still, as the operating rooms in Preah Ket Mealea Hospital did not perform obstetric and pediatric surgery, our results did not include data on obstetric and pediatric patients. A comprehensive and well-designed further prospective observational study should be done to estimate the incidence of anesthesia-related and postoperative complications [32].",
