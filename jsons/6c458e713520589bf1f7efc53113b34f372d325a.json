Also, the increased ACE-2 expression mediated by the COVID-19 entry would contribute to the respiratory dysfunction by agitating the immune response with the increased pro-inflammatory cytokines production, especially IL-10, IL-8 and IL-1\u03b2 (6, 10) . With the ACE2 being highly expressed in lungs among the smokers than the healthy individuals (11), clinicians from China have found the smoking habits doesn't influence the mortality rate among the smokers over the non-smokers (12) . This clinical witness has enlightened nicotine with a bitter taste to benefit the smokers with the likely chances of reducing the COVID-19 virulence (12). Since the whole universe is seeking for a proficient clinical agent to tackle the emerging mortality of COVID-19 patients across the global countries, we have performed this in-silico study to evaluate the effect of nicotine on the soluble ACE2 receptor sensitized with the COVID-19 agonist. We find this in-silico study to be exciting as well as crucial because of its significance; that will unveil the clinical understanding of nicotine binding intervening the soluble ACE2 interactions with the crucial spike (S1) membrane protein of COVID-19. This computational understanding would indeed help the clinicians to prefer nicotine as a supplementary bio-active to treat or prevent the deteriorating health conditions of COVID-19 patients, especially the non-smokers, who are susceptible to detrimental clinical symptoms preceded by the unprecedented pro-inflammatory cytokines production.",

Our docking results unveiled the nicotine's ability to bind profoundly into the pocket of ACE2 protein (Fig. 1a) . It has been found that the positively charged His401 is indulged in direct contact with the nicotine. Also, the His401 has established the concomitant interactions with the Asp382, gly405, His378 and Tyr385 residues. All these residues were localized in the near distal regions of the protein-protein interface (Fig. 2a) . After docking nicotine with the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 complex, it has been found that nicotine establishes a stable interaction with Asp 368 that further interacts with the Thr362, Lys363, Thr365, Thr371 and Ala372 residues (Fig. 2b) . All five amino acid residues engaged in these interactions were located at the proximal site to 353-357 segment of ACE2 protein that are actively participated in the stable interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein. The measured binding energy of nicotine with the soluble ACE2 was found to be -5. ",

It has been shown that COVID-19 interaction with the ACE2 receptor would hinder its function causing severe respiratory ailments with the increased angiotensin II levels (6) . Based on the recent clinical evidence that witnessed only mild adverse symptoms on the COVID-19 patients who are habituated to smoking than their counterparts (12, 32) ; we have planned to study the effect of nicotine binding with the in-silico modelled soluble ACE2 that is widely expressed on the arterial ventricular epithelial cells. This study is in no way tries to glorifiy the intake of nicotine through smoking. But it was mainly intended to understand the role of nicotine in inhibiting the SAR-COV2 protein from interacting with souble ACE2.",

Nevertheless, under the same set-up, the nicotine has established a stable interaction with the ACE2 receptor that got sensitized in-prior with the COVID-19 binding. Also, nicotine's profound affirmative for ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 complex is highly likely to intervene in the interaction of ACE2 with the conserved amino acid residues of the spike (S1) protein of SARS-CoV-2 affecting its virulence. The study results also emphasize that even at a much lower concentration the nicotine would be able to hinder the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with the ACE2 receptor. This might benefit the severely ill COVID-19 patients who are refrained from nicotine usage to overcome their adverse clinical symptoms by getting exposed to a much lower dose of nicotine that demands further clinical validation.

Contradictorily, upon the nicotine's interaction with the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 complex, its binding affinity got increased with -6.33 kcal/mol with the reduced inhibition constant of 22.95 \u00b5M. With the nicotine being binding to the active pocket site of sACE2, the SARS-CoV-2 binds to the spike protein binding site of ACE2. However, nicotine neither established any stable interaction nor developed an inhibitory contant value while interacting with sACE2 receptor alone that contradicts the results shown above with its interaction with the sACE2-SARS-CoV-2 complex. This in-silico observation has vividly explained that nicotine binding could produce pronounced effects on the ACE2 structure only while it gets sensitized with the SARS-CoV-2 binding, and not on the ACE2 structure alone. Indeed this would clearly define the noticeable benefits of nicotine exposure in the COVID-19 affected patients over the unaffected healthy individuals. Moreover, with this steady allosteric interaction of nicotine with ACE2 receptor could profusely intervene its binding with the spike (S1) protein of SARS-CoV-2 thereby showing its ability to tackle the COVID-19 virulence at a much lower dose on the COVID-19 patients.",
