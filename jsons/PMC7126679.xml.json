A first key question is then how to estimate what he calls the \u201cstrength of desire\u201d of consumers and he writes: \u201cit is beyond doubt that a tax can add nothing to the utility of a product; but when we look at it from the consumer's point of view we can say that its existence brings to light undeniably that the product has a utility greater than the cost of production.\u201d (See Dupuit, 1884, p. 85.) A buyer pays a good on which a tax is imposed if he finds at least an equivalent utility in it. Dupuit adds: \u201cfor, in spite of the tax, he is at perfect liberty to buy it or not to buy it. It is not within the power of the state to make him pay, by means of the tax, anything more than the utility which he derives from this purchase.\u201d (See Dupuit, 1884, p. 85.) A second key question is to account for the differentiation of products which can trigger as many \u201cstrength of desire\u201d than they are consumers. Jules Dupuit is one of the first economists to address this situation by business strategies based on price discrimination. In this sense, the market structure is really close to oligopolistic competition.",

For Lufthansa, for instance, only the flights originated form French airports are affected by the solidarity tax. This structure necessitates origin destination data in order to study the impact of solidarity tax. From AEA data, we obtain the number of passengers for business and economy classes within Europe and in the international markets for the airlines which are members of AEA. Note that the solidarity tax is charged per ticket depending on the destination and the fare class, and the AEA data provides the number of passengers for each class and network but not the ticket prices. The main drawback of European data is that ticket price data are not available. For that reason, we use data aggregated at firm level and compute a firm level average solidarity tax by taking the weighted average of tax, as follows:(1)WeightedTax=\u20ac40\u2217Bi+\u20ac4\u2217Ei+\u20ac10\u2217Be+\u20ac1\u2217EeTotalPassenger\u2217rwhere B is the number of business is class passengers and E is the number of Economy class passengers, the index i refers to international flights and the index e to European flights, and r is the euro-dollar exchange rate of the respective year. The weighted solidarity tax is equal to $4.97 per passenger for Air France and, on average, to $0.12 per passenger for other airlines. That is to say, the solidarity tax adds on average approximately $4.50 to each Air France ticket.",

Table 3\npresents these values for the current situation and under two scenarios: i) The equilibrium where all European airlines are charged by the tax; ii) the equilibrium where the solidarity tax is absent.

If all European countries implement the tax then it could result in a 1.65% rise in marginal cost. If France removes the solidarity tax, the passenger traffic would increase by 0.18% which would lead to a 0.21% increase in the market share of the airlines. In other words, airlines would attract passengers who are using other modes of transportation or not travelling. In the absence of the solidarity tax, there would be a 0.14% increase in airlines\u2019 profits and a 0.35% increase in consumer surplus. Hence, the ticket price elasticity would increase by 0.95%; therefore, the passengers becomes more price sensitive if all countries implement the solidarity tax, which is coherent with economic theory.",

The market shares for Air France would increase while for other airlines the market share would almost not change in average.
