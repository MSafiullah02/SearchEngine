In these patients, NIV has achieved significant reductions in the rate of endotracheal intubation and ventilator-associated complications, and has improved survival rates. Nevertheless, some meta-analyses argue against the use of NIV in ARF, because it offers no advantages over conventional ventilation [7, 8]; moreover, delaying intubation in hypoxaemic intubated patients with pneumonia may increase the risk of complications [9, 10].",

Secondary objectives were to assess if NIV use might increase mortality if intubation was subsequently required and if in some patients NIV could be predicted to be more successful. We hypothesized that the use of NIV in patients with ARF because of pandemic viral pneumonia might be effective in some cases and might avoid the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.",

Inclusion criteria were: adult viral pneumonia patients aged over 18 years, febrile (>38\u00b0C) acute illness; respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, myalgia or influenza-like illness; ARF (conventional oxygen therapy \u22650.5 to maintain Spo2 \u226592%) requiring ICU admission; and microbiological confirmation of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1)v by real-time PCR. Data were reported by the attending physician reviewing medical charts and radiological and laboratory records within the first 12 h after ICU admission. Patients with exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute pulmonary oedema, acute asthma and those already intubated at ICU admission or using NIV for palliative use or rescue therapy were excluded from the analysis [11]. The study was approved [11] by the institutional review board of Joan XXIII University Hospital, Tarragona (Spain). Patient identification remained anonymous and the requirement for informed consent was waived because of the observational nature of the study. The ICU admission criteria and treatment decisions for all patients, including determination of the need for intubation and type of antibiotic and antiviral therapy administered, were not standardized and were made by the attending physician.",

To determine the severity of illness, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score [14] was recorded in all patients within 24 h of ICU admission.

Secondary bacterial pneumonia was considered in patients with confirmation of influenza virus infection who showed recurrence of fever, increase in cough and production of purulent sputum plus positive bacterial respiratory or blood cultures [17].

Although, vasopressor use per se is not an absolute contra-indication for NIV, data on vasopressor dosage and lactate levels could have better clarified this aspect. Based on the severity of illness of several patients undergoing NIV, one of the main messages of the present study could be that NIV should not be offered to critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure complicating H1N1 viral pneumonia and other severe acute organ failures.",

First, no data were provided on the severity of acute respiratory failure in the patients included in the study (for instance: respiratory rate, Pao\n2/Fio\n2, Paco\n2, pH). It is different to use NIV at an early stage of respiratory failure (for instance when the Pao\n2/Fio\n2 ratio is <250) or a late stage of ARF in patients presenting with intubation criteria. The lack of these data does not allow comparison of this study with previous studies dealing with hypoxaemic respiratory failure. Moreover, ICU admission and intubation criteria were not standardized. Delay time of intubation after NIV failure was not recorded. For the same reasons, NIV techniques and ventilation protocols are not reported. Again, comparison with previous studies is not possible. In addition, we cannot exclude that the lack of statistical difference in incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia between patients intubated from the beginning (19.2%) and those intubated after NIV failure (11.1%) is the result of a lack of power of the current sample size. In patients at risk of failure with NIV, methods used to optimize NIV are not reported. Another limitation is the self-reporting by sites, which introduces the risk of selection bias. Healthcare workers were not prospectively assessed with follow-up serologies and the safety of the procedure should be investigated. Although no official notification of nosocomially transmitted cases has been reported using this therapy, the technique must be applied using the security measures recommended by the CDC guidelines and many scientific societies. In spite of recommendations against its use and these limitations, clinicians used NIV in nearly half of this large multicentre cohort, and in a significant proportion it was successful, suggesting that patients with severe acute respiratory infection can take benefit from early non-invasive oxygenation techniques. A randomized clinical trial is warranted to determine which patients may benefit from these techniques, to improve prognosis and to help reduce healthcare costs.",
