Figure 1 illustrates the effect. The curve in red shows a rapid increase and decrease in the spread of the virus in a relatively short time period if no precautions are taken. The curve in yellow shows a slower increase and decrease in a relatively longer period if social distancing is practiced. The idea is that a country may adopt a social distancing strategy to \"flatten the curve\" so that the healthcare capacity of the country is not overwhelmed. Since then, several other studies have established this point more firmly, including a detailed study from Imperial College of London (Ferguson et al. 2020).",

Unlike some of the other simulations, VERA enables the user to explicitly specify the conceptual model in a visual language and automatically spawns agent-based simulations from the conceptual models. Given a set of data, VERA automatically extracts initial values for the simulation parameters from the dataset, and it also affords the user to interactively revise the parameter values. The user can view the simulation results, and, if needed, revise the simulation parameters and run another experimental trial, or build an alternative conceptual model. We demonstrate the model development process through comparative models of the impact of social distancing using the Johns Hopkins University dataset (CSSEGISandData, 2020). We describe the use of VERA to develop a SIR model for the spread of COVID-19 and its relationship with healthcare capacity. The results show gradual \"flattening of the curve\" as increasingly intense social distancing strategies are implemented. More importantly, VERA acts like a virtual laboratory to conduct \"what if\" experiments with different SIR models without requiring any knowledge of mathematical equations or computer programming.",

Figure 5 shows the simulation results generated from the model in Figure 4 using different parameter values, as indicated in Table 1 . The first model shows one future progression where the rate spikes early, but there is a sharp decline. This can be compared to South Korea's handling of COVID-19 spread, where medical technology and mass screenings drastically limited the spread. The primary concern here is the capacity of the healthcare system, where demand can easily exceed supply. The next graph shows a model of moderate social distancing. In this case, the peak occurs later, does not reach as high, and stretches the pandemic out for a longer period. Such approaches are straining the healthcare capacity of many European nations now and may not be enough. The final model shows the results of intense social distancing on infection rates. These strong lifestyle changes drastically reduce the number of potential avenues for disease spread, and the resulting spread of infections occurs much slower, providing time, resources, and planning for a society to operate in the times of a pandemic.

Reducing the Average contacts per day per person hypothetically suggest that people are reducing social contact somewhat, but not substantially. Compared to the prior graph, the peak is closer to 7,000 than 8,000, and healthcare capacity is exceeded after 20 days in the simulation, rather than around 15 days-a step in a positive direction. The users can experiment with other values of Average contacts per day per person until they find a scenario where infections do not exceed healthcare capacity. ",

We note, however, that VERA supports conceptual modeling, not mathematical modeling, and that its models are more explanatory of general patterns than predictive of specific outcomes.",

Thus, VERA provides a virtual laboratory: the user can try out a variety of conceptual models and simulation parameters, and conduct \"what if\" virtual experiments. We posit that this has significant implications for learning and education, for example, informal learning by the citizens of the world.",
