Medical activities have been heavily affected during the lockdown: a huge amount of resources were required to face the rapidly growing emergency. Hospitals rapidly reduced scheduled clinical and surgical activities often until closure. Hub centers for neurosurgical emergencies have been settled in various ways [2] . During this period, a significant reduction in access to the emergency departments for both minor and major pathologies has been observed overall, even in the absence of outpatient activities [1] . Many have wondered what has become of the other patients since the disappearance of non-COVID related diseases appeared to be unlikely.",
