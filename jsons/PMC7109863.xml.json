            "text": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an X-linked genetic disease, which is the leading cause of inherited intellectual disability. It was first described by Martin and Bell [1]. It was reported that FXS affects \u223c1 in 2000 men and 1 in 4000 women [2] and 2.8% of the Chinese mental retardation (MR) population screened by DNA analysis had the fragile X full mutation [3]. FXS is caused by the mutations of the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 (FMR1), which is located on the X chromosome and whose locus at Xq27.3 coincides with the folate-sensitive fragile site [4,5]. The syndrome is characterized by MR, macroorchidism, typical facial appearance, and various degrees of autistic behavior [6]. Fragile X-related gene 1 (FXR1) belongs to the FXR gene family including FMR1 and FXR2, and the sequence of FXR1 is highly conservative [7]. The coding products of FXR1 and FXR2 are fragile X-related protein 1 (FXR1P) and FXR2P, respectively. They share 60% identical amino acids with fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is encoded by FMR1 [8,9]. These three proteins share the same characteristic functional domains of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), i.e. two KH domains and one RGG box, which bind to a variety of RNAs [10] and associate with the 60S ribosomal subunits [11]. They also have a nuclear localization signal and a nuclear export signal, which suggests that they can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm [10,12].",

            "text": "FXR1P has seven isoforms [13,14], including one cardiac-specific isoform [15] and three muscle-specific isoforms [14]. FXR1P is essential for postnatal survival. Inactivation of FXR1P in mice leads to impaired myogenesis and finally causes the death of neonates shortly after birth, which most probably is due to an abnormal development of the myocardiac or respiratory muscle [14]. In Xenopus, reduction of FXR1P disrupted the rotation and segmentation of somitic myotomal cell and hindered normal myogenesis [16]. In zebrafish, knockdown of FXR1 caused abnormalities in striated muscle and severe cardiomyopathy and led to heart failure in the embryos [17]. Finally, in humans, altered expression of muscle-specific isoforms of FXR1P had been implicated in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy. These patients had abnormal expression patterns of three different FXR1P muscle-specific isoforms in the myoblasts and the myotubes [18]. In a word, these studies suggested that FXR1P plays important roles in normal muscle development.",

Moreover, the high degree of similarity in protein structure and the relationship among members of the FXR family suggests that FXR1P and FXR2P may both play important roles in the pathogenesis of FXS. However, the function of FXR1P and FXR2P in FXS is far from clear. To gain further insights into the function of these proteins, we aim to identify novel interacting proteins of FXR1P. In this study, we used the full coding sequence of human FXR1P as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid system. Because FXR1P is expressed in fetal brain [19], we chose a human fetal brain cDNA library for screening the FXR1P-interacting proteins [20] and identified novel FXR1P-interacting proteins that could define the function of FXR1P.",

The colonies appearing on SD/Trp\u2212/His\u2212/Leu\u2212 medium were collected and assayed for \u03b2-galactosidase activity. The \u03b2-gal filter lift assay was conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Subsequently, the library from the positive colonies (positive growth in SD/Trp\u2212/His\u2212/Leu\u2212 medium and positive \u03b2-gal activity) were extracted and digested with HindIII. Plasmid fragment sizes were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to segregate the colonies. DNA purified from the positive yeast colonies was used to transfect E. coli Top10.

            "text": "In fluorescence microscopy, co-localization refers to the observation of the spatial overlap between two (or more) different fluorescent labels. Because each label exhibits a separate emission wavelength, it can be used to determine whether the different \u2018targets\u2019 are located in the same area of the cells or very near to one another. This definition can be split into two different phenomena: co-occurrence, which refers to the presence of two (possibly unrelated) fluorophores in the same pixel; and correlation, a much more significant statistical relationship between the fluorophores indicative of a biological interaction [41]. This technique is important in many biological and physiological studies trying to demonstrate a relationship between two proteins. In our study, co-localization is used together with co-immunoprecipitation to characterize protein\u2013protein interactions in a true mammalian environment. As FXR1P plays an important role in normal muscle development, and its absence causes muscular abnormalities in mice, frog, and zebrafish, we used rat VSMCs in the subcellular co-localization experiments. We found that BTF and FXR1P were, respectively, located in the cytoplasm in the transfection assays. However, when the cells were co-transfected with BTF and FXR1P, we found the merged signal in the cytoplasm around the nucleus. Since the interaction between the two proteins was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in vivo, the overlapping staining indicated an interaction between the FXR1P and BTF in mammalian cells, but not co-occurrence. However, evidence showed that the distribution space of BTF and FXR1P can completely overlap with each other in the cells. Thus, this proves indirectly that there is an interaction between these two proteins.",

It was first found in human acute myeloid leukemia cell line KG-1, and it locates on human chromosome 6q22-23 [44]. Although linked to the Bcl-2 family members, BTF does not share structural similarities with these proteins [45]. The most prominent feature of BTF is the presence of an arginine-serine (RS)-rich region located near the N-terminus. RS domain-containing proteins are typically linked with pre-mRNA biogenesis and processing, such as pre-mRNA splicing [46\u201348]. In 2007, Merz et al. [49] examined the composition of human mRNPs by using LC-MS/MS and discovered the presence of BTF among newly identified mRNP proteins. A subsequent study identified BCLAF1 in hmRNP that mediated cyclin D1 message stability with SNIP1, SkIP, TAP150, and Pinin [50].",

Our results suggested that in vivo FXR1P and BTF play a biological role in the forming of a complex or the correlation between them. FXR1 is a housekeeping gene. FXR1P, the protein encoded by FXR1, plays an important role in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Moreover, high expression of FXR1P occurs not only in the brain and the gonad, but also in muscle and heart. Thus, FXR1P is essential to maintain the morphology, structure, and function of these cells.",

Recent research showed that FXR1P can interact with RNA [51\u201356] and affect its stability [51], which suggested that FXR1P can participate in regulating gene expression with two pathways: one is to utilize the miRNA pathway to regulate target mRNA expression [57,58]; the other is to play a role in post-transcriptional regulation by interacting with mRNA directly and affecting the stability of mRNA [51]. Although we have not yet known the specific mechanism and interaction between FXR1P and BTF, we can be sure that BTF is a new member of the regulatory networks of FXR1P, and plays a certain role in the entire regulatory system. Meanwhile, FXR1P may also take part in the apoptosis pathway through the regulation by the Bcl-2 protein family and play a role in the process of regulating the growth and development of the cells. Further studies are necessary to clarify the specific mechanism.",
