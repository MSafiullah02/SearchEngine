Furthermore, there is scientific debate about the methodology of determining VE [5, 6] . These discussions reach the media and influence the general opinion on influenza vaccine benefit. Moreover, to the public, flu as caused by influenza virus is the same as influenza-like illness (ILI) caused by respiratory pathogens, against which influenza vaccination will not protect. Consequently, influenza vaccination is perceived to be ineffective and vaccine uptake is reduced. To counter this trend, data on the relative contribution of influenza virus and other respiratory infections to ILI in older community-dwelling adults are lacking and needed [7] [8] [9] [10] . This group is underrepresented in the Dutch primary care sentinel surveillance system [10, 11] and by definition absent in the Dutch Sentinel Nursing Home Surveillance Network [12] .

Adults aged \u226560 years were recruited through their general practitioner or through the Civil Registry. For the second season, participants were reinvited and additional participants were recruited through the Civil Registry. We also started earlier to use the same monitoring period as in the Dutch sentinel surveillance system [11] . There were no exclusion criteria for the study. Influenza vaccination status was recorded (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) . Participants were part of the study for the entire duration of each season and contacted at the end of season to verify participation. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. All trial-related activities were conducted according to Good Clinical Practice, which includes the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the acknowledged ethical committee METC Noord Holland (http://www.trialregister.nl; NTR3386).",

The following factors were regarded as potential confounders: period in the season (early and late season), sex, smoking, comorbidity, and age (natural smoothing spline, 4 degrees of freedom). The association between the potential confounders and influenza virus positivity (any subtype) was analyzed with univariate logistic regression. Variables with P < .20 were considered in the multivariable analysis. Variables that changed the OR by at least 5% are included in the final multivariable logistic regression model for any influenza subtype (backward selection).

In 60.8% and 44.7% of the acute ILI cases, potential pathogens other than influenza virus were detected. In addition, these pathogens were more often present during ILI than after recovery or in asymptomatic elderly persons. In 20% of the ILI cases, no potential pathogen was detected. The incidence of ILI cases was expected to decrease by a reduction in influenza virus-caused ILI through vaccination; however, this effect was not observed. Instead, the incidence of c Individuals in the asymptomatic subset were selected to be evenly distributed over the different age groups; therefore, the overall vaccination level was higher in the asymptomatic subset compared to the ILI and non-ILI groups. ILI remained the same between the vaccinated and nonvaccinated individuals. Influenza vaccination is offered to individuals 60 years and older in the Netherlands, as older adults are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality from influenza virus infections due to an aging immune system and age-related chronic illnesses [19, 20] . However, this policy is based on studies mostly performed in elderly persons in nursing homes, who are substantially older and more frail compared with community-dwelling elderly individuals. Studies in community-dwelling older adults are scarce [7] [8] [9] [10] , and only a restricted number of pathogens have been analyzed in these surveillance studies. To fill the gap in knowledge, we recruited participants through general practitioners and the Civil Registry, resulting in >99% of the participants living in the community. In line with the risk-based vaccination strategy in the Western world, older participants and participants with chronic conditions were more likely to be vaccinated [2] . The age distribution in the cohort was similar to that observed for those \u226560 years in the general Dutch population; only the oldest age group (>80 years) was underrepresented (Table 2) . These elderly persons are often less likely to participate in studies. \"Healthy user effect\" or \"frailty selection bias\" is a well-known issue in observational influenza vaccine studies, as the very frail elderly persons are difficult to reach [21, 22] .",

Viruses can often be detected in individuals without clinical manifestations [7] , but when they are found as the sole agent in the context of disease, they are commonly considered to be the cause of the disease. For bacteria, this is less clear as they are commonly carried in asymptomatic persons but may expand during respiratory viral infection or new acquisition. Haemophilus influenzae may induce an enhanced inflammatory state in the presence of other pathogens, as was shown in children [23] . This may lead to ILI.

We show that the incidence of influenza virus infection was reduced in individuals who received influenza vaccination and that VE to laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was high to moderate in the 2 seasons.

This may be explained by assuming that a pool of people exists that is highly susceptible to respiratory infections.

Cowling et al have described a similar increased risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infection in influenza-vaccinated children [26] . However, we cannot attribute this effect to a specific pathogen. Influenza virus may take preference over other viruses and prevent them from filling the niche, possibly by inducing a prolonged antiviral state, as has been described for other viruses [23, 27] .

The significant increase in attack rate for influenza virus could be attributed to the influenza virus subtypes A/H1N1pdm09 and influenza B. Influenza A/H3N2 was the predominant influenza virus subtype in both the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 seasons, with similar attack rates.

The percentages were calculated per ILI event. Multiple pathogens could be detected in a single event and therefore contribute to the incidence for multiple pathogens.
