This study aimed to explore the associations between MetS risk factors and the lung function. Subjects/Methods The cross-sectional study included 6945 participants attending health examination between 2010 and 2012 in Taiwan. MetS was assessed according to the criteria of National Cholesterol Education Program III. Spirometric parameters were measured to define lung function. The relationships were tested using multiple linear regression and logistic regression analyses. Results The prevalence of MetS was significantly higher in males (16.2%) than females (3.8%). Although the prevalence of restrictive lung disease (RLD) was comparable between genders (20.7 and 21.0%), males with co-existent MetS had a higher prevalence of RLD than females (27.4 vs. 18.0%). Abdominal obesity, indicated by waist circumference (WC) and weightto-height ratio (WHtR), was the most significant factor associated with lung function decline. Other components of MetS also showed statistically significant relationships, but very weak, with lung function. There was a trend toward an increased prevalence of RLD with the increasing number of MetS scores in males, independent of age, smoking, and body mass index. Conclusions Abdominal obesity was the key component of MetS associated with mechanical effect on lung function impairment in a prime-age adult population. Although RLD was not associated with increased probability of having MetS, the participants with more MetS scores were at a higher risk of losing lung function.",

Furthermore, dyslipidemia has been observed as a biomarker of abnormal lung function [10, 11] , obesity was inversely related to lung function [12] , and fasting serum insulin levels were also negatively correlated with lung function.

WHtR was found to be a prominent and independent predictor of lung function decline in females aged > 45 years. Taking together, our study suggested that abdominal obesity was associated with Our results were comparable with the findings of previous studies showing that abdominal obesity was the most power predictor of poor pulmonary function [9, 13, 20] . Epidemiological studies in adults have also shown that WC, one of the indicators of abdominal adiposity, is a risk factor for pulmonary function deterioration [21, 22] . The underlying mechanisms are associated with excess adipose tissue within abdominal region that exerts a mechanical effect on the lungs, by reducing the capacity of the diaphragm to limit lung inflation, consequently diminishes the chest wall movement [16] . Body fat distributions in men, pre-and postmenopausal women were different, where males generally accumulate more abdominal body fat whereas premenopausal women develop larger lower body fat. Menopause is associated with fat deposition shift to visceral depot and correlated to rapid onset of the metabolic syndrome [23, 24] . Adipose tissue function and deposition differ by gender. Females have more subcutaneous fat prior to menopause and postmenopausal women can have up to twice the amount of visceral adipose tissue than premenopausal women [25] ; it is therefore interesting to investigate the relationships between lung function deterioration and the loss of the hormonal protective environment after menopause and the negative effects related to different fat distribution. Furthermore, our results added to the existing evidence in a recent meta-analysis of more than 500 studies that showed an inverse relationship between WC and lung function parameters, a greater effect of WC among men compared to women, and central obesity is possibly associated with restrictive patterns, but not airways obstruction [26] . Central obesity may affect ventilator mechanics because it limits diaphragm expansion [16] . The gender differences might be associated with breathing movements of the chest and abdominal wall [27] and fat distribution that affect pulmonary function differently for women and men [28] . By contrast, there are some inconsistencies that exist between our findings and other studies. Chen et al. found negative correlations between FEV 1 /FVC and WC for both males and females after adjustments for age, height, weight, workload, energy consumption, and smoking [29] . While we observed similar trend except for females over aged > 45 years.",

However, lung function impairment is developed through multiple and simultaneous mechanisms; prediction using any of these biomarkers should be taken with precautions and should also highlight the importance of MetS in lung function. Particularly, compared with Caucasians, Asians tend to have a higher percentage of body fat and a tendency to more central obesity [15, 33, 34] and that are the most possible mechanisms contributing to airflow limitation [35] and consequent restrictive respiration impairment [22] .

Our study provided an insight on how obesity contributes to the development of lung function decline and the interplay between MetS and lung function. RLD was not associated with increased probability of having MetS. Risk of losing lung function was greater in the participants with more MetS scores. Because there are relatively few women with metabolic syndrome over the age of 45, the weaker association among women requires further research to draw conclusion.",
