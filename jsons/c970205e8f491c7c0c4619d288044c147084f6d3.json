            "text": "In the last decade of the twentieth century, particular concern began to be expressed that globalisation was facilitating the spread of infectious disease. In 1992 for example the US Institute of Medicine issued a report which warned \"some infectious diseases that now affect people in other parts of the world represent potential threats to the United States because of global interdependence, modern transportation, trade and changing social and cultural patterns\" (Lederberg et al, 1992, pv) . Framing infectious disease in this way was part of a growing appreciation that a series of new security challenges, such as terrorism, drug trafficking, and environmental degradation, were supplanting the more traditional state centric national security concerns of the Cold War era. (Brower and Chalk, 2003) As remarked upon by James Woolsey during his nomination hearing for director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1993: \"In many ways today's threats are harder to observe and understand . . . Yes, we have slain a large dragon, but now find ourselves living in a jungle with a bewildering number of poisonous snakes\" (Woolsey, 1993, p76) .",

            "text": "The intelligence community had first taken up the issue of the threat posed by infectious disease in the 1990s in relation to HIV/AIDS (CIA, 1991) . However a declassified National Intelligence Estimate from January 2000 expanded the scope of diseases that might pose security concerns. The report noted, for example, that since 1973 at least thirty previously unknown diseases had been identified and at least twenty older infectious diseases had re-emerged or spread geographically over the same period frequently in drug resistant form. The authors of the report believed that \"The spread of infectious diseases results as much from changes in human behaviourincluding lifestyles and land use patterns, increased trade and travel, and inappropriate use of antibiotic drugs-as from mutations in pathogens\" and suggested that, new and re-emerging infectious diseases will pose a rising global health threat and will complicate US and global security over the next 20 years. These diseases will endanger US citizens at home and abroad, threaten US armed forces deployed overseas, and exacerbate social and political instability in key countries and regions in which the United States has significant interests. (NIC, 2000) What prompted the release of this National Intelligence Estimate was the announcement by the then US Secretary of State Madeline Albright that the first UN Security Council session of the new millennium would be devoted exclusively to the threat to Africa from HIV/AIDS. Whilst this session is often remarked upon for ultimately leading to resolution 1308 on the Responsibility of the Security Council in the Maintenance of International Peace and Security: HIV/AIDS and International Peace-keeping Operations, it was the discussions within the session that did much to characterise the evolving nature of the relationship between infectious disease and security concerns. UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, for example, noted that the impact of AIDS in Africa was \"no less destructive than that of warfare itself and by some measures it was far worse\" and went on:",

            "text": "Nowhere else had AIDS become a threat to economic, social and political stability on the scale that it now was in Southern and Eastern Africa . . . In already unstable societies . . . that cocktail of disasters was a sure recipe for more conflict. And conflict, in turn, provided fertile ground for further infections. The breakdown of health and education services, the obstruction of humanitarian assistance, the displacement of whole populations and a high infection rate among soldiers . . . all ensured that the epidemic spread ever further and faster. (UNSC, 2000) As President of the Security Council during this session, US Vice-President Al Gore noted that the links being articulated between HIV/AIDS and insecurity presented an opportunity to recast the work of the Security Council for the new century. With echoes of Woolsey's comments at his nomination hearing for CIA director seven years earlier, Gore is reported to have said that for the past 50 years the Security Council: had dealt with a classic security agenda built upon common efforts to resist aggression, and to stop armed conflict. But while the old threats still faced the global community, there were new forces that now or soon would challenge the international order, raising issues of peace and war . . . includ[ing] the challenges of: the environment; drugs and corruption; terror; and new pandemics. (ibid) Three months later, in April 2000, President Clinton took the unprecedented step of designating an infectious disease (AIDS) a threat to US national security (Gellman, 2000, pA01) Taken together, these actions signalled a \"securitization\" (Buzan et al, 1998) of infectious disease that resulted in greater political interest and access to larger economic resources so as to tackle to issue on a global scale. In line with the \"securitization\" thesis, political interest in HIV/ AIDS has remained high and superior financial resources have indeed been accessed. This included US President George W. Bush promising $15 billion over five years to international HIV/AIDS programmes in his 2003 State of the Union Speech. However, Selgelid and Enemark (2012) note that HIV/ AIDS is a disease of attrition, meaning that \"the effects of these diseases are relatively familiar and slow-acting, they do not concentrate the minds of people and politicians as readily as an unfamiliar and sudden outbreak crisis.\" Consequently it was growing anxiety over a perceived new type of terrorist that may deliberately use infectious disease to further their aims which gave further salience to the relationship between infectious disease and security concerns.",

            "text": "The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 9/11 fundamentally altered perceived societal vulnerability towards terrorist use of infectious disease. Though the events themselves were quite unrelated to biological weapons (i.e. the hostile use of disease), the idea that non state actors, including terrorists, might seek to employ biological weapons to further their aims was lifted from (arguably) a niche concern to a mainstream security issue. Calling it niche is not to say that bioterrorism had not been considered a security threat prior to 2001many commentators had noted the potential (see for example Stern, 1993; Tucker, 1996 Tucker, , 2000 Moodie and Roberts, 1997; Smithson and Levy, 2000) ; table top exercises had been conducted, domestic preparedness programmes initiated (Guillemin, 2011, p7) , and in countries such as the US, policy directives had been crafted that gave the highest priority to \"developing effective capabilities to detect, prevent, defeat and manage the consequences of nuclear, biological or chemical materials or weapons use by terrorists\" (United States, 1995) . However what the 9/11 attacks did was alter the global frame of reference about what terrorists writ large might now be prepared to undertake. The attacks appeared to suggest that what had been considered previously as restraining factors on terrorist actions, such as limiting casualties so as not to \"risk of alienating the public especially their own supporters\" were no longer valid (Butler, 2004, p30) . Instead this new breed of terrorist and extremist appeared to want to cause casualties on a massive scale, and appeared undeterred by the fear of alienating the public, their own supporters, or indeed by considerations of personal survival.",

Twenty-one others went on to be diagnosed with either inhalational or cutaneous forms of anthrax and five more people died. The source of the exposure was five letters containing anthrax spores anonymously posted to media outlets and members of the Senate. Coming so soon after the 9/11 attacks, these letters created a near hysterical atmosphere. Tucker writes:",

            "text": "Cable news networks hyped the bioterrorism threat with apocalyptic scenarios; postal workers sorted mail wearing rubber gloves and surgical masks; thousands of Senate staff members were put on prophylactic antibiotics; and letters addressed to government officials were irradiated with electron beams to kill lingering spores, delaying mail for weeks. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of ordinary Americans stockpiled ciprofloxacin (a potent antibiotic with potentially dangerous side effects), snapped up gas masks of questionable effectiveness from army supply stores and hoarded canned food and bottled water in anticipation of spreading epidemics and quarantines. (Tucker, 2001, p255) Although the letters were only posted in the US, the anthrax letter attacks had global impact particularly because of the cognitive link that was made between biological weapons and the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks. 1 In Europe for example, civil protection and security forces were put on alert, and public health systems had to deal with numerous items of mail containing powders suspected of being contaminated with anthrax. And at the political level, European countries acted at both the community level and national level. In October 2001 for example, the heads of state and government asked for a European level programme to be prepared to improve the cooperation between member states for the evaluation of risks, alerts, and intervention, and the collaboration in the field of research. At the national level many European countries re-examined their preparedness plans and strengthened or implemented new measures designed to prevent the misuse of the biological sciences. This included placing restrictions on physical access to, and work performed with, certain pathogens labelled as \"dangerous.\" 2 European states were not alone in re-examining their preparedness programmes: in the US for example, at least three new pieces of legislation were enacted in quick succession aimed at preventing the misuse of disease and they significantly increased their investment in bio-defences, including medical countermeasures. 3 At the international level, the threat from the deliberate spreading of disease slotted neatly into the global \"war on terror\" that President Bush had launched in the days following 9/11. Addressing the United Nations General Assembly in November 2001 Bush described terrorists as searching for weapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their hatred into holocaust. They can be expected to use chemical, biological and nuclear weapons the moment they are capable of doing so. No hint of conscience would prevent it. This threat cannot be ignored. This threat cannot be appeased. Civilization, itself, the civilization we share, is threatened. (Bush, 2001) Consequently the global community also acted together to combat the threat from bioterrorism. This included a range of activities including \"operational\" initiatives such as the Proliferation Security Initiative, the G8 Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction and the Global Health Security Initiative 4 as well as broadening the mandate of international organisations such as the World Health Organisation such that they now had a role in responding to the \"natural occurrence, accidental release or deliberate use of biological and chemical agents or radionuclear material that affect health.\" (WHA, 2002) At the diplomatic level, the work of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) now became focused on a broadened understanding of the threat posed by biological weapons, including the possibility of terrorist use of biological agents. The focus prior to 2001 had been state level adherence to the norms of the BWC. However if properly implemented at the national level, the Convention addresses potential terrorist use by transferring the obligations that states agree tonot to develop, produce, manufacture or stockpile biological and toxin weapons or methods of delivery of such weaponsonto individuals in their territory or under their jurisdiction anywhere. When tabling a number of proposals for future work in late 2001 the US delegation noted that \"many of these ideas will bear little resemblance to the traditional arms control measures of the past\" including the negotiation of a legally binding verification protocol which had recently failed (US Department of State, 2001). These alternative proposals eventually initiated an \"intersessional process\" where states parties to the BWC meet twice yearly to discuss, promote common understanding and achieve effective action on a number of topics related to this broadened understanding of biological threats. 5",

Because international flight times are shorter than the incubation periods for many infectious diseases, any one of 700 million international airline passengers every year can be an unwitting global disease-carrier. (Anan, p14) Part of the stimulus for framing of the threats from infectious disease as \"without borders\" came from the experiences of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. The sudden appearance of SARS had, by the time the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the outbreak contained in July 2003, spread to 27 countries on all continents, infected more than 8000 people and presented an 11% lethality rate. (WHO, 2004) Unlike the apocalyptic \"dread risk\" scenarios for bioterrorism attacks in the same period, SARS was a \"dread reality\": evidence showed SARS to be a fast spreading disease that did not require a vector; symptoms appeared to begin an average of four days after exposure to an infected person and mimicked many common diseaseshigh fever, a dry cough and shortness of breath (WHO, 2007) and the disease showed no particular geographical affinity. Indeed on this last point an association was made early on between SARS and travel on commercial airlines (see for example Olsen et al, 2003) which resulted in guidelines being issued regarding travel to and from areas affected by SARS that focused on hand hygiene and specified that anyone suspected of having SARS should wear a facemask. However, public perception of the risk of becoming infected with SARS led to widespread use of facemasks whether on a flight or not (see for example Hesketh, 2003 .",

This intelligence had been gathered by GOARN's early warning element which collects and verifies reports and rumours of epidemics from a wide variety of unofficial sources, including nongovernmental organisations, news media, electronic discussion groups such as the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases, and other official surveillance networks. When the WHO was eventually able to act, the response side of GOARN was activated and within a period of weeks after the first recognised case, a virtual network of eleven leading infectious disease laboratories in nine countries had been established. Connected by a secure website and daily teleconferences, the laboratories collaborated to identify the causative agent of SARS and to develop a diagnostic test; similar groups were also created to pool clinical knowledge and compare epidemiological data on SARS (Knobler et al, 2004) . The WHO used this information to make recommendations on patient management which included issuing travel recommendations in an attempt to curb, and eventually stop, the international spread of this newly recognised virus (Heymann, 2004) .",

(i) to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and (ii) to potentially require a coordinated international response.

Regarding the actions of the WHO itself, the panel's assessment regarded there to have been \"significant and unjustifiable delays\" in declaring the Ebola outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, despite early warnings about the outbreak from its own staff and from non governmental organisations such as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, and that the \"WHO does not currently possess the capacity or organizational culture to deliver a full emergency public health response\" (WHO, 2015, p6) . Part of the reason for this is that there are no core funds for emergency response and the panel recommended the immediate creation of a contingency fund in support of outbreak response as well as the establishment of a WHO Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response which would develop the necessary new structures and procedures to achieve full preparedness and response capacity.",

            "text": "The spectrum of issues being addressed by the Global Health Security Agenda reflects the evolution of biosecurity issues since the end of the Cold War. What had previously been considered as two separate domainspublic health and national securityhave now become merged to create a spectrum of biosecurity issues that encompasses naturally occurring incidents, accidental outbreaks and deliberate use of infectious disease. This intertwining is reflected in both domains: in the public health domain, the WHO for example had its mandate extended to include responding to deliberate use of biological agents and in the traditional arms control arena, states parties to the Biological Weapons Convention are creating synergistic relations with public health organisations to further their aims of mitigating the effects of a deliberate use should it occur. In addition, the Global Health Security Agenda also reflects a change in views regarding responsibility for responding to this spectrum of biosecurity issues: whereas in 2000 the Security Council viewed HIV/AIDS as posing a threat to a geographically defined area, the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the potential of an influenza pandemic shortly thereafter illustrated the truly global interconnected nature of the threat and so the shared international responsibility of responding to them. To use an argument put forward by Andrew Lakoff and Stephan Collier (2008) , the issue for the future is not whether a disease outbreak can be characterised as a biosecurity threat which requires attention but what kind of biosecurity problem does it present, what kind of techniques are used to assess them and what is the most appropriate kinds of responses. NOTES 1. On this see for example Central Intelligence Agency, Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction, 1st July-31st December 2003. Available at https://www.cia.gov/ library/reports/archived-reports-1/july_dec2003.htm#chemical. 2. For example: In the UK, the 2001 Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Act, created a list of \"dangerous\" pathogens which required additional security requirements and access restrictions. In addition, the Secretary of State now had to be informed of any premises where any dangerous substances was kept and used. 3. In addition to political action, the scientific community also responded to the perceived heightened vulnerability, especially addressing what actions they might take to support national efforts to prepare against deliberate attacks using disease and what actions they needed to take to prevent their work from being deliberately misused and contributing to the development of biological weapons. For more on this see McLeish C (2006) \"Science and censorship in an age of bioweapons threat\" Science and Culture 15:3, 215-236; McLeish C and P Nightingale (2007) \"Biosecurity, bioterrorism and the governance of science:",
