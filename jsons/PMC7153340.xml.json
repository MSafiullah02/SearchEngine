            "text": "Several events over the past 23 years have changed the way scientists acquire and work with pathogenic microorganisms and biological toxins in the United States (US) and internationally (Morse, 2015). These events, which have increased national and international awareness of the potential or real threat of terrorism (including bioterrorism), include the unlawful attempt by an individual with ties to white supremacist groups to acquire Yersinia pestis (Carus, 2002); the documented unsuccessful anthrax attack in Kameido, Tokyo (Olsen, 1999, Takahashi et al., 1993, Danzig et al., 2011) and the release of the nerve agent sarin in the subway system of Tokyo in 1995 by the Aum Shinrikyo (Olsen, 1999, Danzig et al., 2011, Kaplan, 2000); the bombing of the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 (Smoak and Geiling, 2004); the terrorist attacks using commercial airlines on September 11, 2001 (Smoak and Geiling, 2004); and the 2001 anthrax attacks in the US (Cole, 2003, Decker, 2018). The 2001 anthrax attack was a major impetus in the development of the field of microbial forensics. In an effort to control the misuse of dangerous pathogens and toxins by those wishing to do harm, the US passed several laws (Public Law 104-132, 1996, Public Law 107-188, 2002, Public Law 107-56, 2001) and subsequently promulgated regulations (i.e., Select Agent Regulations) (42 C.F.R, 9 C.F.R, 7 C.F.R) designed to limit unauthorized access to these agents. For a historical perspective on the development of these regulations, the reader is referred to Morse (2015). The creation of an oversight role for the federal government in the area of biological sciences has evoked concern within the scientific community and is considered by some to actually increase societal vulnerability to biological attacks and natural epidemics (Casadevall and Relman, 2010). The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the Select Agent Regulations and other regulations that will impact the practice of microbial forensics.",

The list is not static and is reviewed on a biennial basis by the respective select agent programs with advice and input from the Interagency Select Agents and Toxins Technical Advisory Committee (ISATTAC). The review is designed to provide an objective (i.e., quantitative) review in determining whether an agent or toxin should be added, removed, or maintained on the select agent list. Furthermore, agents and toxins can be added to (or deleted from) the list at any time by amending the regulations in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552) by providing notification of the proposed amendment in the Federal Register and the opportunity for public comment, as illustrated by the addition of Bacillus cereus Biovar anthracis in 2016 (CDC and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2016). Currently, all regulated toxins are on the HHS list. However, these toxins are subject to the regulation only if the aggregate amount of the toxin under the control of a principal investigator, treating physician or veterinarian, or commercial manufacturer or distributor exceeds the amount specified in the regulations (see Table 28.2\n). These de minimis amounts represent an attempt to balance the requirement for regulatory oversight of toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety with the need for their availability for critical research, forensic, and educational purposes. The de minimis amounts in the regulations are based on the amount a person with a legitimate need, such as a principal investigator, could safely possess without constituting a significant threat to public health and safety.",

Any organism that contains regulated recombinant or synthetic nucleic acids are subject to the regulations unless the organisms or nucleic acids are excluded as (i) a nonviable select agent or nontoxic toxin; (ii) an excluded attenuated strain, or (iii) an excluded select toxin modified to be less potent or toxic (see below).",

The select agent regulations do not apply to variola major genetic elements because the World Health Organization (WHO) has already placed significant restrictions on the possession, use, and transfer of these materials. Institutions other than the two currently recognized WHO collaborating centers (CDC, Atlanta, GA, and State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology, Koltsovo, Novosibirsk, Russia) may not possess genetic fragments exceeding 20% of the variola major virus genome (for further information refer to http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/research/en/). These restrictions are followed by the CDC but are not legally binding. However, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 175c makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly produce, engineer, synthesize, acquire, transfer directly or indirectly, receive, possess, import, export, or use, or possess and threaten to use the variola virus.

The Board recommended that the government should take steps to increase awareness among providers and users of synthetic genomic materials regarding compliance with the select agent regulations and provide providers with a list of genomic materials explicitly covered by the regulations. In response, HHS developed recommended baseline standards for the gene and genome synthesis industry and other providers of synthetic double-stranded DNA products regarding the screening or orders so that they are filled in compliance with current US regulations (Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). The first de novo synthesis of horsepox virus, a member of the orthopoxvirus group, which includes Variola virus, has heightened concerns about the reemergence of smallpox as a threat to global health security (Koblenz, 2017).",

Nevertheless, the 2005 Select Agent Final Rule applied the same regulatory controls regardless of the agent, which made it difficult to conduct legitimate research using less pathogenic select agents (Casadevall and Relman, 2010, National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, 2009). Therefore, it was recommended by a government advisory board (National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, 2009) that the list of select agents be reduced or stratified. Subsequently, Executive Order 13546, which was signed on July 2, 2010, directed the Secretaries of HHS and USDA to designate those select agents that pose the greatest risk of deliberate misuse with the greatest potential for mass casualties or devastating effects to the economy, critical infrastructure, or public confidence as Tier 1 agents and toxins (see organisms indicated by footnote c in Table 28.1) and amend their respective regulations to establish security standards specific to these agents and toxins (The President, 2010). A federal panel employed several criteria, as well as information from the intelligence community, to identify 13 agents that were classified as Tier 1 (Bhattacharjee, 2011). The number of Tier 1 agents was subsequently increased to 14 in 2016 by the addition of B. cereus biovar anthracis (CDC and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2016). Currently, only nucleic acids that encode the toxic forms of botulinum neurotoxins, or infectious forms of Foot-and-Mouth Disease virus, are regulated as a Tier 1 agent, which means that all Tier 1 regulatory requirements apply to these nucleic acids (see below).",

A few examples of exemptions should suffice. A clinical laboratory that isolates a select agent from a clinical specimen is exempt from requirements of the select agent regulation, provided that (i) within 7 calendar days after identification, the select agent is transferred in accordance with the regulation or destroyed on-site by a recognized sterilization process (Isolation of a Tier 1 select agent or toxin requires the immediate notification of the Select Agent Program by telephone, facsimile, or email) followed within 7 calendar days by the submission of an APHIS/CDC Form 4; (ii) the select agent is secured against theft, loss, or release during the period between identification and transfer or destruction; and (iii) identification of the select agent is reported to the CDC or APHIS and to other appropriate authorities when required by federal, state, or local law. Another example is that select agents or toxins or products containing select agents or toxins are exempt from the select agent regulation provisions if they are cleared, approved, licensed, or registered under certain laws.

The biosafety/biocontainment plan must be based on a site-specific assessment, which provides protection commensurate with the risk of the agent and its intended use. Biosafety procedures (e.g., operational work practices and personal protective equipment) and physical containment features (e.g., facility design and engineering controls) sufficient to contain the agent must be included. The plan must be reviewed, and drills must be conducted at least annually. A guidance document (Table 28.4) is available to assist entities in developing this written plan and can be accessed at https://www.selectagents.gov/compliance.html. The guidance document has links to several valuable resources including the guide Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (Chosewood and Wilson, 2007). Entities registered for Tier 1 select agents and toxins also require an occupational health program. Information regarding the occupational health program may be incorporated into the biosafety/biocontainment plan.",

Because of the threat these agents pose, they are likely to be used by bioterrorists and other criminals and, therefore, may become the subject of forensic analyses. Performing research of select agents and toxins is also critical for the development of effective medical countermeasures and, ultimately, the development of effective vaccines. The Select Agent Regulation has been in effect for more than 20 years. During this time, hundreds of entities have registered with the CDC or APHIS to possess, use, or transfer select agents and toxins, and thousands of individuals have been approved to work with these agents at registered facilities. The CDC and APHIS have developed a highly integrated regulatory oversight program, characterized by uniform regulations, a common database (the National Select Agent Registry), and a shared common website (https://selectagents.gov).",
