Very little is known about the passage of viruses across the placenta or the role of placental viral infection in adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes.

Once the infection has crossed the placenta into the fetal circulation, there is the potential for adverse fetal outcomes. These can be caused by the infectious agent directly or indirectly through the fetal and/or placental inflammatory response to infection, where proinflammatory cytokines may adversely affect the developing brain and perhaps also placental function.",

Such multiple analyses increase the likelihood of identifying chance statistical associations (type 1 error) and because of small numbers in some of the subanalyses, associations cannot be confidently excluded (type 2 error).

Our chosen outcomes may causally interact to result in an APO, and there are inherent difficulties in determining the roles played by the individual outcomes.

One mechanism by which such associations could be explained is the inflammatory response caused by these viruses. Vessel inflammation and artery wall thickening, as a result of viral infection, can contribute to the increased resistance of blood vessels,\n4\n thus promoting a hypertensive state. HSV\u20101, HSV\u20102 and CMV, members of the herpesvirus family, are capable of causing thrombogenic changes to host cells and initiating the clotting cascade through the generation of thrombin,\n32\n thus promoting vascular disease. A large cross\u2010sectional study by Sun et al.\n\n4\n found that HSV\u20102 infection was associated with essential hypertension.",

A marginally significant trend was observed (P = 0.05) between CMV exposure and PIHD in preterm infants born to mothers who had PIHD. We did not observe significant findings for the small subgroup PIHD with SGA. This may be because of the very small numbers in this subgroup, and large prospective studies would be needed to rule out such associations. von Dadelszen et al.\n\n33\n showed that women with early\u2010onset pre\u2010eclampsia had higher levels of anti\u2010CMV antibodies than those with late\u2010onset pre\u2010eclampsia, those with normotensive intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and those with normal pregnancies. Exposure to CMV and subsequent production of anti\u2010CMV antibodies may generate pathogenic antiphospholipid antibodies, which are capable of binding and activating endothelial cells.\n34\n This in turn may enhance thrombus formation and increase inflammation, resulting in hypertension. A similar connection has been identified for enteroviral infection and atherosclerosis,\n35\n suggesting that several viral infections are capable of increasing blood pressure and causing hypertension. A study reported by Belfort et al.\n\n36\n demonstrated a significant association between evidence of CMV infection and pre\u2010eclampsia (P < 0.01), thus supporting an association between pre\u2010eclampsia and viral infection during pregnancy. An alternative hypothesis to explain the link between CMV and APOs is that CMV may affect the biology of cytotrophoblasts and thus critical cytotrophoblast function.\n17\n\n",

The results do, however, agree with van Dongen et al.,\n40\n who found no associations between IUGR and adenoviruses or enteroviruses. Discrepancies may be explained by study design differences. Our study used nonquantitative PCR methodology on archived newborn screening cards, and there remains the possibility of the results reflecting differing viral loads. Low viral loads may not invoke significant inflammatory/cytokine responses and therefore may not create susceptibility to APOs, such as PTB or SGA; alternatively, high viral loads, possibly associated with major inflammation and/or damaging cytokine production, could be necessary before such adverse outcomes are observed. Furthermore, these results may reflect different gestational ages at which exposure to the virus first occurred. Infections that occur earlier in intrauterine life tend to be associated with more severe clinical sequelae compared with those occurring later.\n41\n Positive amniotic fluid viral DNA PCR results have been associated with an increased rate of fetal structural malformations, IUGR, hydrops and other fetal abnormalities.\n6\n These tests were performed between 19\u201320 weeks of gestation compared with 3\u20135 days after birth in the current study, which may explain the differing results. Prospective studies designed to quantify viral loads at various gestational ages are planned to investigate this hypothesis further. Such prospective studies will also determine whether these infections are primary infections or reactivation of latent viral infection. This study was unable to test every potential virus worthy of investigation (e.g. adenoviruses, rotaviruses, human coronaviruses, parvovirus, paramyxoviruses and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus), and these should be investigated in future studies.",

A similar control group prevalence of 44% was reported in 2005 by other authors,\n42\n suggesting that antenatal viral exposure is common but not clinically relevant unless other factors are present to initiate infection and/or an inflammatory response. It is important to recognise that the presence of viral DNA does not necessarily indicate active congenital or neonatal infection. Newborn screening cards were tested for the presence of viral DNA and RNA. While detection of viral nucleic acids in the blood of neonates indicates exposure to and replication of the respective virus or viruses, this study was not designed to detect evidence of an accompanying inflammatory response. Given the small sample volume (1.2 mm diameter) of dried blood and the limit of detection of 1\u201310 viral nucleic acid copies, it could not be confirmed that true viraemic infection was occurring. It would seem unlikely that the detection of viral nucleic acid in such small samples merely reflected maternal and fetal cell trafficking or maternal blood contamination. The possibility of nosocomial infection needs to be considered, although it is thought exceedingly unlikely that this infection would have had time to incubate and cause infection in the newborn infant within the first days of life without clinical symptoms. Clinically, a nosocomial infection rate of 40% in our control population would have been identified as a major epidemic, which was not evident. Prospective investigations are required to follow women through pregnancy, quantitatively testing antenatal blood samples for viral nucleic acids and determining if there is active infection in the fetus/neonate by examining leukocytes and sera for the presence of viral antigens associated with active viral replication. PCR contamination was excluded by working in two designated separate laboratories for preparation of PCR samples (to eliminate the possibility of PCR product contamination) and by using appropriate controls in all assays. Furthermore, no other viral PCR work was being conducted by other users of the PCR laboratories.",
