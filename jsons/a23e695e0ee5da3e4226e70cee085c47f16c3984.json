The alignment of nosocomial clusters with the time periods of greatest incidence (>35 incident cases at the period's peak) suggests nosocomial transmission is a key driver of transmission in the MERS-CoV epidemic as opposed to seasonal events, such as the Hajj or camel-breeding season that occur in the fall and spring, respectively. The absence of apparent seasonality in the identified clusters further supports the significant role humanto-human transmission in healthcare settings plays in the propagation of MERS-CoV. Classification of each cluster into one or more of the three disease transmission categories (nosocomial, household, or exported) elucidated common characteristics among the clusters, including the overall concentration of case clusters in cities and healthcare institutions. With nosocomial transmission accounting for 41 of the identified clusters (80\u00b74%), the role of healthcare facilities, transportation protocols during inter-and intra-hospital transfers, and the contribution of cultural norms such as 'doctor shopping' became apparent themes observed throughout this analysis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In ROK, practices such as seeking healthcare at multiple facilities, or 'doctor shopping', and being cared for by relatives while hospitalized are believed to have contributed to the emergence of the largest outbreak outside of KSA during the MERS-CoV epidemic [12, 13] .

The MERS-CoV outbreak in ROK included 15 clusters at separate healthcare institutions, each with an index case related to an ongoing MERS-CoV cluster at another facility. Between May 2015 and July 2015, 186 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases were reported.

The most common theme in the perpetuation of transmission among nosocomial clusters was the role of more transient departments in the healthcare setting, such as dialysis units and emergency departments, which were implicated in a majority of the nosocomial clusters identified in this analysis. At least seven of the 23 clusters identified in KSA occurred in designated MERS-CoV treatment centers, which were presumably best equipped to handle these infectious cases. However, the nosocomial transmission that persisted in these clusters suggests inconsistent infection control practices across different departments of those designated hospitals [14] . HCWs likely contributed to the continued transmission among patients and between wards within a hospital, as HCWs represent 159 (19\u00b75%) of the clusterassociated cases. Of the 41 clusters classified as nosocomial, 30 clusters (73\u00b72%) involved HCWs. The use of Tier 1 data collected as the MERS-CoV outbreak progressed is one of the greatest strengths of this comprehensive cluster analysis. Collection of the data and emerging literature in real time allowed for an inclusive literature review from which cluster identification and evaluation of key components of the outbreak could be analyzed.

Although the particular epidemiological details regarding the exact location of exposure were generally not provided for cases during the three aforementioned clusters, Tier 1 sources often denoted if a case was under investigation for a possible link to a hospital with the known ongoing transmission of MERS-CoV, which reinforced the inclusion of these cases in their respective clusters.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 278, "end": 285, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "In addition to limitations on precise case inclusion in the larger clusters denoted above, availability of date of symptom onset may have created an artifact in the cluster date and duration, potentially altering its appearance on temporal scales.
