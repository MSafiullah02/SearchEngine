In Brazil, despite the availability of safe and effective vaccines, CPV is considered the most common viral agent associated with enteritis in puppies (Castro et al., 2010b, Castro et al., 2011). However, data regarding CCoV infections in puppies have been restricted to serological surveys. The main objective of this study was to conduct a molecular characterization of the CCoV strains that circulate in Brazil by partially amplifying the M and S genes.",
