However, recent studies have shown that infection of swine with H9N2 viruses causes significant morbidity and mortality [31]. Most of the diseased pigs showed typical respiratory signs, including fever, nasal and ocular discharge, coughing and dyspnoea. In some cases, paralysis associated with fatal disease was also observed [5]. Pigs are believed to serve as intermediate hosts for adaptation of avian influenza viruses that infect humans, and it has been shown that some of the H9N2 influenza viruses currently circulating in China have molecular features that allow them to preferentially bind to human \u03b1-2,6-NeuAcGal receptors [15, 24]. The recurring presence of H9N2 infections in pigs and humans has raised concerns about the possibility that H9N2 viruses are capable of evolving into pandemic strains [9, 26, 28].",

More recently, it was demonstrated that an H9N2 virus showed enhanced replication and efficient transmission by direct contact in a ferret model [28]. It is well known that influenza viruses mainly cause pulmonary infection in animals and humans, but little information is available regarding H9N2 viral infection in lungs in mammals. Therefore, it is urgent to evaluate the pathology of pulmonary infection caused by currently circulating H9N2 viruses in an appropriate animal model. Here, an H9N2 avian virus with high lethality for mice, isolated recently from northern China, was used to address this in a mouse model. The results suggest that H9N2 viral infection induces a typical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in mice that resembles the common features of ARDS [2, 29]. Our data may facilitate studies of the pathogenesis of future potential avian H9N2 disease in humans.",

The isolate was designated as A/Chicken/Hebei/4/2008(H9N2) (Ck/HB/4/08). The complete genome sequences of the virus are available from GenBank under accession numbers FJ499463\u2013FJ499470. Our previous studies showed that this isolate was a reassortant virus containing A/Chicken/Beijing/1/94-virus-like HA, NA, and NS genes, an A/quail/HongKong/G1/97-like M gene, and A/Chicken/Shanghai/F/1998-like RNP genes. We analyzed its pathogenicity in chickens and mice in detail and found that it replicated efficiently in chicken lungs but did not cause obvious clinical signs in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. However, the mice exhibited high mortality rates and severe lung injury when inoculated with Ck/HB/4/08 virus without prior adaptation (data not shown). The virus was propagated in the allantoic cavities of 10-day-old embryonated SPF chicken eggs at 37\u00b0C for 72 h and stored at \u221280\u00b0C for use in all of the experiments described herein. The 50% mouse infectious dose (MID50), 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD50) and 50% egg infectious dose (EID50) of Ck/HB/4/08 were determined by serial titration of virus in 10-day-old embryonated SPF chicken eggs at 37\u00b0C. Titers were calculated by the method of Reed and Muench as described previously [23]. All manipulations were performed under BSL-3+ laboratory conditions. Animal experiments were conducted according to established guidelines and approved by the Animal Care Committee of China Agricultural University (Beijing, People\u2019s Republic of China).",

During the experiment, mice had access to food and water ad libitum.

Since some infected mice died between day 4 and day 6 postinfection (p.i.), larger groups (100 per group) of mice were used. Ten mice of each group were chosen randomly, weighed and euthanized on days 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 14 p.i., and the following parameters were observed: Lung injury was assessed by testing lung water content and histopathology. Arterial blood gas, white blood cell counts, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-6 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and viral titers in the lungs were measured at different times.",

However, little information is available regarding H9N2 virus infection in lungs of mice. To address this, BALB/c mice were infected intranasally with 1 \u00d7 104 MID50 of Chicken/HB/4 H9N2 viruses, and the pathological changes in the lungs were evaluated. Our data show that H9N2 viral infection without prior adaptation caused severe respiratory disease with a high mortality of 60%. Most of the infected mice exhibited clinical signs of severe respiratory disease with obvious respiratory distress. Gross observation revealed highly edematous lungs in infected mice, which was also demonstrated by a dramatically increased lung wet:dry weight ratio and lung wet weight:body weight ratio. Histopathological evaluation showed that infected mice displayed a similar histopathological pattern, with severe diffuse pneumonia and alveolar damage, characterized by neutrophil-dominant inflammatory cellular infiltration, interstitial and alveolar edema, hemorrhage, and severe bronchiolitis/peribronchiolitis. Additionally, arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated that the PaO2 decreased dramatically and the PaCO2 increased significantly when disease was exacerbated. This indicated that most of the infected mice developed progressive and severe hypoxemia consistent with the time course of clinical signs and pulmonary lesions for ARDS. The features described above satisfy the criteria of ARDS [2, 20\u201322, 29] and show that H9N2 viral infection resulted in the prominent ARDS in mice.",

Viral infection resulted in high titers of viruses on days 1\u20137 p.i., with the peak viral titer on day 5 p.i. This was consistent with the time course of the severity of H9N2 viral respiratory disease in mice, indicating that high viral replication may be important for H9N2 viral disease pathogenesis. It is believed that TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 may play an important role in the development of ARDS [3, 10, 25]. In most studies, cytokines in patients with ARDS have been described as an inflammatory \u2018cascade\u2019 or \u2018network\u2019, and thus their actions were not easily manipulated [22]. H5N1 virus induced high levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in BALF and serum in the mouse ARDS model [32]. In this regard, our finding that H9N2 viral infection resulted in significantly increased TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in BALF is similar to that of the previous study of H5N1 virus infection. The role of these cytokines in lung inflammation during H9N2 viral infection remains to be investigated.",

The inflammatory response triggered by direct or indirect insults to the lung involves the recruitment of blood leukocytes, the activation of tissue macrophages, and the production of a series of different mediators such as cytokines, chemokines and oxygen radicals [2, 3, 10, 16, 22, 25, 29]. Lung injury may be a direct consequence of this inflammatory response. In H9N2-virus-infected mice, we observed that circulating leukocytes dramatically decreased in the blood and that a great number of inflammatory cells infiltrated the lungs. In addition, the neutrophils in BALF increased approximately 14-fold compared to control mice on day 5 p.i. These results suggested that a great number of leukocytes, especially neutrophils, were recruited from the bloodstream and sequestrated mainly in the lungs, and this might be involved in the host inflammation response and severe pulmonary lesions induced by H9N2 viral infection.",
