Since COVID-19 is highly contagious with a certain mortality rate, it was classified as a class B infectious disease and was managed as a Class A infectious disease in China in January 2020 [1] . China has taken strict infection control measures, isolated the exposed and suspected cases according to international standards, constantly updated the diagnosis and treatment process and carried out public education [2] . SARS-CoV-2, along with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), all belong to \u03b2 -coronavirus. In the past 20 years, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have caused more than 10,000 infected patients worldwide. The mortality rate of SARS-CoV infection is 10%, of which the mortality rate of SARS-CoV infection in pregnant women is 25%, and the mortality rate of MERS-CoV infection is Up to 37% [3] [4] [5] [6] . Pregnant women are susceptible population of SARS-CoV-2 which are more likely to have complications and even progresse to severe illness. There is not enough data to determine the effect of COVID-19 infection on the fetus. Whether COVID-19 has mother-to-child vertical transmission and its short-term and long-term harm to offspring is still unclear.",

As she was febrile, she was referred to the fever clinic of Wuhan Tongji Hospital the next morning. Thoracic computerized tomography scan showed ground-glass opacities in the left upper and lower lobes, indicating the possibility of viral pneumonia (Fig. 1 ).

The clinical manifestations of the mother and the baby were both mild and the baby's prognosis was well. Whether the case is intrauterine vertical transmission or not remains controversial. Although the results of nucleic acid detection of cord blood and placenta in this case are negative, which do not support the diagnosis of intrauterine transmission, but the possibility of vertical intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not ruled out. The reasons are as follows: 1) When the viral load is not high enough, the detection rate of existing methods is limited and false negatives may occur. Therefore, the negative results of umbilical cord blood and placental nucleic acid during the operation do not exclude the possibility of false negatives. 2) According to the clinical manifestations, the pregnant woman first had fever symptoms at 22:00 on February 1. However, the CT result after a few hours showed ground-glass opacities in the left upper and lower lobes, suggesting that the pregnant woman may have been asymptomatic in the early stage. Since we lack the data of maternal viral load, there is no evidence whether the fetus has been infected with maternal viremia in utero before the mother had any clinical manifestation.3) In addition to this case, neonatal infections have been reported in other provinces and cities in China [14] . The possibility of mother-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be ruled out.",

However, since we did not retain the specimens of the newborn's pharyngeal swabs shortly after birth, the first time we took samples of the newborn's pharyngeal swabs was 36 hours after birth. During this period, we can not rule out the possibility of other contact transmission of newborn. In addition, it has been confirmed that SARS coronavirus was detected by RT-PCR in the maternal peritoneal fluid collected during cesarean section in 28 SARS patients [17] , which reminds us that it is very important to shorten the delivery time of fetus and minimize the contact between fetus and maternal blood and body fluid during cesarean section.",
