            "text": "Although the COVID-19 virus (SARS-CoV-2) has not yet been detected in AGPs, care should be taken to reduce the risk of surgical staff infection in the operating room. In experimental conditions SARS-Cov-2 has recently been shown to have aerosol and fomite transmission potential similar to SARS-Cov-1 (the most closely related human virus), in particular remaining in aerosols for 3 hours or more and on surfaces for up to 72 hours.4 In anticipation of a substantial amount of operations in the near future of COVID-19 carriers and infected patients, a simple and effective measure for the evacuation and entrapment of smoke and aerosol is needed. Due to collapsing economies and limited availability for appropriate filter equipment within this pandemic, we suggest the use of a simple, very low-cost filtration system with readily available components in the operating room for immediate implementation. Standard electrostatic filters used for ventilation machines have the capability of filtering known bacterial and viral loads with great efficiency5 and most are certified for 99.99% effective protection against HBV and HCV which have a diameter of 42 nm and 30 to 60 nm respectively.6 SARS-CoV-2 has a larger diameter of 70 to 90 nm7 therefore the same filtering efficiency can be expected to apply for new virus. This filter can be connected via standard tubing to the trocar evacuation port to constitute an evacuation and filtering system which evacuates the generated smoke, as well as filter the potential viral load to ensure surgical staff safety. To connect the filter to the tubing we use the endotracheal tube connector (Fig. 1A, B). No active suctioning is attached to this system.",

Although the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh published important guidance of surgical care to protect patients and surgeons,10 we disagree with the statement that laparoscopy should be avoided. Provided a simple, safe, and reliable filtering and evacuation system for pneumoperitoneum gases is used, and that strict precautions are abided to, laparoscopy is potentially preferable to open surgery, where smoke contamination is uncontrollable. Suggestions such as instrument cleaning during surgery, deflating pneumoperitoneum prior to removing trocars, conversion or specimen extraction, as highlighted by the Chinese and Italian experience, are particularly helpful.1",
