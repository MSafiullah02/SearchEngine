            "text": "Morpholino oligos (Morpholinos) are synthetic, uncharged P\u2010chiral analogs of nucleic acids. They are typically constructed by linking together 25 subunits, each bearing a nucleic acid base. Figure 1 illustrates the structure of three Morpholino subunits joined by inter\u2010subunit linkages. The Morpholino phosphorodiamidate backbone of Morpholinos consists of morpholine rings that bear methylene groups that are bound to modified phosphates in which the anionic oxygen is replaced by a nonionic dimethylamino group. The substituted phosphate is bound through a phosphorus\u2010nitrogen bond to the nitrogen atom of another morpholine ring. One standard DNA nucleobase (adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine) is bound to each morpholine ring. The ends of Morpholinos are conventionally named 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 by analogy with the nomenclature for nucleic acids (though if one were to number the atoms of a Morpholino oligonucleotide backbone by IUPAC rules, the numbers assigned to the ends would be different). The secondary amine of the morpholine ring at the end of an unmodified Morpholino oligonucleotide is called the 3\u2032 end of the oligo, whereas the 5\u2032 end terminates with a carboxamidated phosphorodiamidate group (Fig. 1).",

The first company he founded, now called Sarepta Therapeutics Inc., has successfully brought the first approved Morpholino drug through clinical trials, receiving accelerated approval from the U.S. FDA to market that drug (FDA, 2016). The drug, called eteplirsen or EXONDYS 51, is a Morpholino oligo targeting exon 51 of the most common human dystrophin transcript, the 79\u2010exon isoform. For some people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who have frameshift mutations, causing exon 51 to be removed from mature mRNA (\u201cskipping\u201d the exon) can restore the reading frame of dystrophin so that an internally truncated protein is produced. This is predicted to benefit about 13% of the DMD population (Mendell et al., 2013). Small amounts of standard Morpholino oligos can enter dystrophic muscle, but do not usefully enter wild\u2010type muscle; this shows that, for standard Morpholino oligos, DMD is especially amenable for treatment and delivery barriers will need to be overcome, perhaps by conjugation of the Morpholino to a delivery moiety, to apply the oligos effectively for treatment of many other diseases (Moulton and Moulton, 2010).",

This favors the interaction of Morpholinos with nucleic acids, since there is no repulsion between anionic backbones as there is in duplexes of natural nucleic acids. Dissolved in pure water, nucleic acids lose their ability to form stable Watson\u2010Crick bonds due to anionic repulsion between strands, whereas Morpholinos will still bind to complementary sequences (Summerton, 2004). Because Morpholinos are uncharged, they have no strong electrostatic interactions with proteins. Unmodified Morpholinos have little or no affinity for bovine or human serum albumin when assessed by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (H.M. Moulton, unpub. observ.). In contrast, interactions of anionic phosphorothioate oligos with proteins cause multiple physiological, non\u2010antisense effects (Lebedeva and Stein, 2001). Proteins that bind nucleic acids generally interact electrostatically with the anionic phosphates of nucleic acids, stabilizing binding. Morpholinos appear to have little or no interaction with nucleic acid\u2013binding proteins (Hudziak et al., 1996). The synthesis of their subunits and assembly on a solid\u2010phase resin has been described (Summerton and Weller, 1997), and modified synthesis protocols offering alterative protecting group and activation schemes and have been published (Bhadra et al., 2015).",

In no case was degradation of the Morpholinos detected (Hudziak et al., 1996). Morpholinos were incubated in serum and in liver homogenate without degradation (Summerton and Weller, 1997). When peptide\u2010Morpholino conjugates were extracted from cells and analyzed by MALDI\u2010TOF mass spectrometry, the Morpholino oligo component was not degraded in the cells, although a range of degradation products from the peptide moiety were detected (Youngblood et al., 2007).",

On the basis of molecular modeling, the bases of Morpholinos should stack in a fashion analogous to those of natural nucleic acids, allowing strong interactions with complementary nucleic acid sequences by Watson\u2010Crick base pairing. A 400 MHz 1H NMR analysis of a carbamate\u2010linked nucleic acid analog using morpholine rings instead of sugars found the morpholine ring in the chair conformation (Stirchak et al., 1989). Molecular modeling of a Morpholino with the morpholine rings in the chair conformation suggests that a Morpholino and an RNA form an A\u2010form heteroduplex with a helical pitch similar to that of an A\u2010form RNA\u2010RNA duplex (J.E.

However, single strands of mRNA folded into secondary structures contain single\u2010stranded regions, such as the loops of stem\u2010loops, with which Morpholinos can readily hybridize. Given that double\u2010stranded regions of most RNA secondary structures are shorter than 25 base pairs, the overall binding affinity of Morpholinos for RNA is sufficient to invade and displace those short double\u2010stranded regions (Summerton, 1999).",

Morpholinos targeted to these snRNP\u2010binding sites can modify splicing (Sazani et al., 2001), either preventing splicing and causing an intron inclusion (Giles et al., 1999) or redirecting splicing and causing an exon excision (Draper et al., 2001). Blocking a splice site can cause activation of a cryptic splice site, complicating interpretation of the splice modification by producing partial deletions of exons (Draper et al., 2001) or partial inclusions of introns.

Along similar lines, Morpholinos targeted across the cleavage site of a hammerhead ribozyme inhibited auto\u2010cleavage, leading to a greater than two orders of magnitude increase in the expression of a downstream reporter gene (Yen et al., 2004). Morpholinos have also been shown to block intronic splice silencers (Bruno et al., 2004) and exonic splice enhancers (McClorey et al., 2006), redirecting splicing. Morpholinos binding poly(A) signal sequences can inhibit poly(A) tailing (Wada et al., 2012).

            "text": "Radioisotope delivery into organisms can be pretargeted using Morpholinos (Mang'era et al., 2001). Practitioners of nuclear medicine strive to minimize radiation exposure of a patient while delivering radionuclides to target tissues for imaging or for therapeutic applications. By attaching radioisotopes to antibodies that are specific for target tissues, the antibodies can anchor isotopes on these tissues. Because the large antibody molecules diffuse slowly, the isotopes must be maintained in the plasma at high concentrations or for long durations to achieve good delivery of radioisotope\u2010linked antibodies to their targets. Pretargeting with Morpholinos involves introducing an antibody\u2010Morpholino conjugate into the bloodstream; this can be done using high concentrations or re\u2010dosing to saturate the target without exposing the patient to radiation during this pretargeting stage. Next, a conjugate of a radioisotope (possibly chelated) with a complementary Morpholino is added to the blood. Because the Morpholino has a much smaller molecular mass than an antibody, the radionuclide\u2010Morpholino conjugate diffuses relatively quickly and is captured at the target tissue more rapidly through Morpholino\u2010Morpholino pairing. Unbound radionuclide\u2010Morpholino conjugate is rapidly eliminated through the kidneys. This technique allows delivery of radioisotopes to the targeted tissue while exposing the organism to lower doses of radiation away from the targeted region. In the process of developing these techniques, pharmacokinetics of Morpholino\u2010radionuclide conjugates have been studied in vivo (Liu et al., 2002a,b; He et al., 2003). In a recent modification, signals are amplified by binding a polymer bearing many complementary Morpholinos to each Morpholino\u2010conjugated antibody fragment, followed by delivering radioisotope\u2010labeled Morpholino complementary to the polymer\u2010linked Morpholinos (He et al., 2003, 2004). Cell\u2010surface membrane proteins can be concentrated in a small region of the plasma membrane by binding them with Morpholino\u2010conjugated antibodies and then exposing the cell to polymer particles bearing the complementary Morpholinos (Chu et al., 2015).",

When a short sequence of one part of an oligo is complementary to another short sequence separated by an intervening sequence, stem\u2010loops can form. If small self\u2010complementary sequences are separated by zero to a few bases, formation of a stable stem\u2010loop is unlikely because a hairpin with a small loop is not energetically favored. To prevent loss of oligo activity through competition between self\u2010pairing and target binding, it is prudent to limit self\u2010complementary sequences in oligo designs to 16 contiguous hydrogen bonds or less, where CG pairs contribute three hydrogen bonds and AT pairs contribute two hydrogen bonds. For instance, the short sequences ATGGC and GCCAT can form 13 contiguous hydrogen bonds (2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13). When analyzing sequences for self\u2010complementarity, check for both Watson\u2010Crick base\u2010pairing and for GT base\u2010pairing. Like an AT pair, a GT pair also forms two hydrogen bonds. However, because the overall stability of the GT pair is far lower than an AT pair, a GT pair can be scored as a single hydrogen bond when calculating its contribution to the stability of a self\u2010complementary moiety (Aboul\u2010ela et al., 1985).",

In the first steps of translation, the initiation complex forms at the 5\u2032 cap and then scans through the UTR to the start codon (Fig. 3A). At the start codon, the large ribosomal subunit binds, initiation factors dissociate, and translation proceeds through the coding region. If a Morpholino gets in the way of the initiation complex before the initiation complex reaches the start codon, it prevents assembly of the ribosome and translation of the mRNA. Nonetheless, it is preferable to target the start codon instead of upstream for two reasons. First, the quality of sequence deposited in public databases can be poor in the UTR, especially for older sequence records. Second, though rare in vertebrate genomes, internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) do exist and can allow a ribosome to enter and assemble downstream of a Morpholino bound in the 5\u2032\u2010UTR.",

However, since Morpholinos are not charged, they will not form electrostatic complexes with cationic delivery reagents. Without such complexation, the Morpholinos are poorly delivered to the cytosol of treated cell cultures. To overcome this limitation, Morpholinos can be annealed to complementary or partially complementary strands of anionic nucleic acids. Special Delivery oligos are heteroduplexes of Morpholinos and partially complementary DNA, and are delivered after complexation with EPEI (Morcos, 2001). Special Delivery oligos were designed as a replacement for scrape loading of adherent cells, but can also be used with cells in suspension. Special Delivery oligos provide a more homogeneous delivery than scrape loading, and many studies have been published using them. However, several problems are inherent in the system: (1) EPEI is somewhat toxic to cells; (2) the concentration ratio of heteroduplex to EPEI is fixed; (3) only a single oligo sequence can be delivered at an effective concentration at any one time; and (4) the complexation procedure, which must be done prior to each delivery, adds complexity and variability to the experiment. While Special Delivery oligos can be made by following a fairly simple protocol, they are no longer available commercially as paired heteroduplexes.

This uses a Morpholino targeting exon 7 of the human SMN2 gene, conjugated with an arginine\u2010rich pip6a cell\u2010penetrating peptide. Spinal muscular atrophy is a severe neuromuscular disease of humans caused by loss of functional SMN1 protein. Fortunately, the SMN1 gene is duplicated, forming the SMN2 gene. SMN2 has a mutant splice site preventing its expression, but, if splicing is redirected to the wild\u2010spliced site by blocking a splice silencer regulatory motif in intron 7, the SMN2 protein is expressed and can compensate for the lack of SMN1. When 10.0 \u03bcg/g pip6a\u2010Morpholino was administered once to SMA model mouse pups (postnatal day 0) by facial vein injection, median survival time increased to 167 days compared to 12 days for untreated and saline\u2010treated mice. Muscle strength and the ability to respond to a head\u2010down position on a slope by turning around (negative geotaxis assay) were both significantly improved by pip6a\u2010Morpholino treatment compared to untreated or standard Morpholino\u2010treated pups by day 12. With doses of pip6a\u2010Morpholino given on postnatal day 0 and 2, survival improved to a median of 283 days for 5.0 \u03bcg/g doses and 457 days for 10.0 \u03bcg/g doses, with no detected toxicity. Two doses of a scrambled\u2010sequence pip6a\u2010Morpholino did not improve survival, while two doses of SMN2 Morpholino without a cell\u2010penetrating peptide improved survival to a median 54 days for 10 \u03bcg/g doses. The mice given two doses of pip6a\u2010Morpholino gained weight faster than untreated SMA mice, but not as fast as wild type. Hindlimb strength and performance in the negative geotaxis assay of the two\u2010dose mice greatly improved over untreated SMA mice. Dose\u2010dependent increases in the transgenic human SMA protein and the full\u2010length transgene transcript were measured, and improvement in neural morphology was observed after treatment with SMN2 pip6a\u2010Morpholino. Dosing adult mice carrying a human SMN2 transgene twice, 2 days apart, by tail\u2010vein injection of 18 mg/kg pip6a\u2010Morpholino resulted in significant up\u2010regulation of the full\u2010length human transgene, with up to three\u2010fold more of the transgene product accumulating 7 days post\u2010administration in some muscles of the pip6a\u2010Morpholino treated mice relative to saline\u2010treated controls (Hammond et al., 2016).",

The dendrimeric delivery moiety is toxic, so the dose of a Vivo\u2010Morpholino is limited in vivo by the amount tolerated by the animal.

However, it is important to keep in mind that it cannot be predicted with certainty whether a splice\u2010blocking Morpholino will cause an exon deletion (most common), an intron insertion, activation of a cryptic splice site (which can cause a partial insertion or deletion), or a multiple exon skip. Because cryptic sites might redirect splicing of only a fraction of the targeted pre\u2010mRNA population, splice blocking can produce a mixture of RT\u2010PCR product masses (Draper et al., 2001). To detect most of these changes, it is best to use primers targeted to the two exons flanking and closest to, but not including, the exon abutting the Morpholino's splice junction (though revealing a multi\u2010exon skip requires more widely\u2010spaced primers). Targeting a splice junction on an internal exon (i.e., not the first or last) is most likely to cause exon deletion.

If an oligo targets a high\u2010copy\u2010number transcript, requiring relatively high Morpholino concentration for knockdown, and the mispair oligo interacts with a low\u2010copy\u2010number transcript, the mispair oligo might cause effects even at concentrations below the concentration at which the targeting oligo becomes effective.",

The Morpholino gave rise to a severe vascular tube formation phenotype not seen in the mutant, which was shown to carry a severe or null mutation. Fish with egfl7 mutated were injected with the egfl7 Morpholino and surprisingly these fish had a reduced incidence of the vascular phenotype compared to wild\u2010type fish injected with the same Morpholino, indicating that the mutant fish were less sensitive to the Morpholino than the wild\u2010type fish; this was the first hint that a change in the mutant fish might conceal the phenotype the Morpholino induced in wild\u2010type fish. The vascular defect phenotype associated with the Morpholino was recapitulated in experiments using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to inhibit egfl7 expression. Comparison of over 6000 protein concentrations by 4\u2010hr \u2018single shot\u2019 liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) found one protein that was strongly up\u2010regulated (>5\u00d7) in the mutants compared to the morphants; this protein, Emilin3a, shares an important functional structure, the EMI domain, with Egfl7, and might be compensating for the loss of egfl7 in the mutants. RNA sequencing and qPCR found emilin3a, emilin3b, and emilin2a up\u2010regulated in the egfl7 mutants but not in embryos with egfl7 knocked down by Morpholinos or CRISPRi. When co\u2010injected with the egfl7 Morpholino, mRNAs for Emilin2 or Emilin3 were able to rescue the circulatory phenotype. Similarly, up\u2010regulation of vegfab was found for vegfaa mutants but not vegfaa morphants. Instead of Morpholino off\u2010target effects, compensation for loss of a transcript in a mutant may underlie many mutant\u2010morphant phenotype discrepancies; indeed, \u201cfor egfl7, one can identify a dose of MO that has no effect in most egfl7 mutant embryos but causes clear vascular defects in WT, indicating that these morphant phenotypes are not due to off\u2010target effects.\u201d (Rossi et al., 2015). If compensation in some mutants conceals the function of some genes, but these functions can be revealed by knockdown technologies, it is not reasonable to insist that Morpholino phenotypes must be copied by mutants for publication. To \u201crequire an observed MO\u2010induced phenotype to be validated in embryos bearing mutations in the same gene\u201d can exclude valuable insights from the literature. The mistrust of Morpholino data engendered by the Kok paper may even lead to grant\u2010review committees inappropriately blocking consideration of well\u2010crafted studies relying primarily on knockdown technologies to reveal gene function.
