Because of the vital role that these S proteins play, they represent a vulnerable target for the development of therapeutics. Here, we describe the isolation of single-domain antibodies (VHHs) from a llama immunized with prefusion-stabilized coronavirus spikes. These VHHs neutralize MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1 S pseudotyped viruses, respectively. Crystal structures of these VHHs bound to their respective viral targets reveal two distinct epitopes, but both VHHs interfere with receptor binding. We also show cross-reactivity between the SARS-CoV-1 S-directed VHH and SARS-CoV-2 S and demonstrate that this cross-reactive VHH neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses as a bivalent human IgG Fc-fusion. These data provide a molecular basis for the neutralization of pathogenic betacoronaviruses by VHHs and suggest that these molecules may serve as useful therapeutics during coronavirus outbreaks.",

The S protein forms a trimeric complex that can be functionally categorized into two distinct subunits, S1 and S2, that are separated by a protease cleavage site. The S1 subunit contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD), which interacts with a hostcell receptor protein to trigger membrane fusion. The S2 subunit contains the membrane fusion machinery, including the hydrophobic fusion peptide and the a-helical heptad repeats. The functional host cell receptors for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV are angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), respectively (Li et al., 2003; Raj et al., 2013) . The interactions between these receptors and their respective RBDs have been thoroughly characterized, both structurally and biophysically (Li et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2013) . Recently, it has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 S also makes use of ACE2 as a functional host-cell receptor, and several structures of this complex have already been reported (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Lan et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Recent advances in cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) have allowed researchers to determine high-resolution structures of the trimeric S protein ectodomains and understand how S functions as a macromolecular machine (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016; Li et al., 2005; Walls et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2013) . Initial cryo-EM characterization of the SARS-CoV-1 spike revealed that the RBDs adopted at least two distinct conformations. In the ''up'' conformation, the RBDs jut out away from the rest of S, such that they can easily engage ACE2 without steric clash. In the ''down'' conformation, the RBDs are tightly packed against the top of the S2 subunit, preventing binding by ACE2 (Gui et al., 2017) . Subsequent experiments have corroborated this phenomenon and similar dynamics have been observed in MERS-CoV S, SARS-CoV-2 S, and in alphacoronavirus S proteins (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017; Walls et al., 2020; Wrapp and McLellan, 2019; Wrapp et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2017) . Because of the relatively low abundance of particles that can be observed by cryo-EM with three RBDs in the up conformation, it is thought that this conformation may correspond to an energetically unstable state (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018; Pallesen et al., 2017) . These observations have led to the hypothesis that the CoV RBDs might act as a molecular ratchet: a receptor-binding event would trap the RBD in the less stable up conformation, leading to gradual destabilization of S1 until S2 is finally triggered to initiate membrane fusion. Recent experiments characterizing RBD-directed anti-SARS-CoV-1 antibodies that trap the SARS-CoV-1 RBD in the up conformation and lead to destabilization of the prefusion S have lent support to this hypothesis (Walls et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "Numerous anti-SARS-CoV-1 RBD and anti-MERS-CoV RBD antibodies have been reported, and their mechanisms of neutralization can be attributed to the occlusion of the receptor-binding site and to trapping the RBD in the unstable up conformation, effectively acting as a receptor mimic that triggers a premature transition from the prefusion-to-postfusion conformation (Hwang et al., 2006; Walls et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018; . In addition to conventional antibodies, camelids also produce heavy-chain-only antibodies (HCAbs), which contain a single variable domain (VHH) instead of two variable domains (VH and VL) that make up the equivalent antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of conventional immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies (Hamers-Casterman et al., 1993) . This single variable domain, in the absence of an effector domain, is referred to as a single-domain antibody, VHH, or Nanobody and typically can acquire affinities and specificities for antigens comparable to conventional antibodies. VHHs can easily be constructed into multivalent formats and they have higher thermal stability and chemostability than most antibodies (De Vlieger et al., 2018; Dumoulin et al., 2002; Govaert et al., 2012; Laursen et al., 2018; Rotman et al., 2015; van der Linden et al., 1999) . VHHs are also known to be less susceptible to steric hindrances that might prevent the binding of larger conventional antibodies (Forsman et al., 2008) . Their advantageous biophysical properties have led to the evaluation of several VHHs as therapeutics against common respiratory pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Detalle et al., 2015; Rossey et al., 2017) . The use of VHHs as biologics in the context of a respiratory infection is a particularly attractive application, because the highly stable VHHs can be nebulized and administered via an inhaler directly to the site of infection (Respaud et al., 2015) . Moreover, because of their stability after prolonged storage, VHHs could be stockpiled as therapeutic treatment options in case of an epidemic. Although therapeutics against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are sorely needed, the feasibility of using VHHs for this purpose has not yet been adequately explored. Several MERS-CoV S-directed VHHs have been reported as a result of camelid immunization, but their epitopes remain largely undefined, other than being classified as RBD-directed (Stalin Raj et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018) .",

We solved the crystal structures of these two VHHs in complex with their respective viral epitopes, which suggested likely mechanisms of neutralization were occlusion of the receptor-binding interface and trapping of the RBDs in the up conformation. We also show that the SARS-CoV-1 RBDdirected VHH cross-reacts with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and can block the receptor-binding interface. After engineering this VHH into a bivalent Fc-fusion, we show that this cross-reactive VHH can also neutralize SARS-CoV-2 S pseudoviruses. We further demonstrate that the VHH-Fc fusion can be produced at high yields in an industry-standard CHO cell system, suggesting that it merits further investigation as a potential therapeutic for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",

Therefore, we sequentially immunized a llama subcutaneously twice with SARS-CoV-1 S protein, twice with MERS-CoV S protein, once again with SARS-CoV-1 S, and finally with both SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV S protein ( Figure S1A ). To obtain VHHs directed against these S proteins, two consecutive rounds of panning were performed by phage display using either SARS-CoV-1 S or MERS-CoV S proteins. Positive clones were sequenced, and multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis using the neighbor-joining method revealed that seven unique MERS-CoV S and five unique SARS-CoV-1 S VHHs were isolated ( Figure S1B ). These VHHs and an irrelevant control (RSV F-VHH, directed against the F protein of human respiratory syncytial virus) were subsequently expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified from the yeast medium (Rossey et al., 2017) . The binding of the purified VHHs to prefusion-stabilized MERS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-1 S was confirmed by ELISA ( Figure S1C ). As expected, the irrelevant control had no detectable binding to MERS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-1 S. Four clones , obtained after panning on MERS-CoV S protein, bound with high affinity to prefusion-stabilized MERS-CoV S, whereas the affinities of VHH-2, -20 and -15 were 100-to 1000-fold weaker. Of ll the five clones isolated after panning on SARS-CoV-1 S protein, three VHH clones (SARS VHH-72, -1, and -6) interacted strongly with prefusion stabilized SARS-CoV-1 S protein. We observed no cross-reactivity of MERS VHHs with SARS-CoV-1 S and vice versa (data not shown).",

No binding of SARS VHH-44 to either the SARS-CoV-1 S or NTD protein was detected, leaving the domain that this VHH recognizes undetermined. These data demonstrate that the neutralizing SARS VHH-72 and MERS VHH-55 target the RBDs. Based on the specificity and potent neutralizing capacity of SARS VHH-72 and MERS VHH-55, we measured the affinities of these VHHs by immobilizing recombinantly expressed VHH to a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensorchip and determined the binding kinetics for their respective RBDs. We found that both of these VHHs bound to their targets with high affinity. SARS VHH-72 bound to its target with an affinity of 1.2 nM and MERS VHH-55 bound to its target with an affinity of 79.2 pM, in part due to a very slow off-rate constant (k d = 8.2 x10 \u00c05 s \u00c01 ) ( Figure 1B ).",

This residue exhibits natural sequence variation in several MERS-CoV strains, such that a Leu is occasionally observed at this position. To evaluate the extent to which this substitution impacts MERS VHH-55 binding, we generated a F506L substitution and measured binding by SPR ( Figure S4C ). This substitution resulted in a~200-fold reduction in MERS VHH-55 binding affinity. Despite this substantial reduction, the affinity of MERS VHH-55 to MERS-CoV RBD F506L remained high, with a K D = 16.5 nM. Other than the variability that is observed at position 506 of the MERS-CoV RBD, the rest of the MERS VHH-55 epitope is highly conserved across the 863 strains that are curated in the MERS-CoV Virus Variation database ( Figure S4A ). Despite this predicted broad recognition of MERS-CoV strains, the average sequence identity of 24% between the MERS-CoV RBD and the RBDs from the seasonal coronaviruses HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 makes it un-likely that MERS VHH-55 would cross-react with any of these more distantly related S proteins.",

We obtained a molecular replacement solution and refined the structure to an R work /R free of 20.3%/23.6% through iterative building and refinement (Table S2 ). Our structure reveals that CDRs 2 and 3 contribute to most of the 834 \u00c5 2 of buried surface area at the binding interface ( Figure 3A ). This epitope does not, however, overlap with the ACE2 footprint on the SARS-CoV-1 RBD. Rather, ACE2 would clash with the CDRdistal framework of SARS VHH-72, as opposed to classical receptor blocking in which the CDRs would occupy the ACE2 binding interface ( Figure 3B ). ACE2 also carries an N-glycan modification at position Asn322 (Yan et al., 2020) . When bound to the RBD, this N-glycan points into the space that is occupied by SARS VHH-72, forming an even larger clash ( Figure 3C ). SARS VHH-72 binds to the SARS-CoV-1 RBD through a hydrogen-bond network involving CDRs 2 and 3, in which backbone groups participate extensively ( Figures 3D and 3E ). This network probably accounts for the high-affinity binding that we observed for these two molecules.",

The equilibrium dissociation constant of SARS VHH-72 for the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 was~39 nM, substantially higher than for the SARS-CoV-1 RBD. The weaker binding can primarily be attributed to an increase in the dissociation rate constant (Figure 4A ). The only variant residue on the SARS-CoV-1 RBD that makes direct contact with SARS VHH-72 is Arg426, which is Asn439 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD ( Figure 3C ). This mutation prevents the formation of a salt bridge with Asp61 from SARS VHH-72, which likely contributes to the increased dissociation rate constant. Because of an average sequence identity of only 25% between the SARS-CoV-1 RBD and the RBDs of the seasonal coronaviruses, we predict that SARS VHH-72 cross-reactivity is likely confined to the RBD from SARS-CoV-2 and closely related betacoronaviruses such as WIV1-CoV.",

When the MERS-CoV RBDs are all in the down conformation or all in the up conformation, MERS VHH-55 would be able to bind all three of the protomers making up the functional spike trimer without forming any clashes. However, if a down protomer was bound by MERS VHH-55 and the neighboring protomer sampled the up conformation, this RBD would then be trapped in this state by the presence of the neighboring MERS VHH-55 molecule ( Figure 5A ). This conformational trapping would be even more pronounced upon SARS VHH-72 binding to the SARS-CoV-1 S protein or the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Because of the binding angle of SARS VHH-72, when a bound SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 RBD samples the down conformation, it would clash with the S2 fusion subunit, regardless of the conformations of the neighboring RBDs ( Figures 5B and 5C) . Therefore, once a single SARS VHH-72 binding event took place, the bound protomer would be trapped in the up conformation until either SARS VHH-72 was released or until the S protein was triggered to undergo the prefusion-to-postfusion transition. Based on the binding angles of MERS VHH-55 and SARS VHH-72, we can conclude that these molecules would likely disrupt the RBD dynamics in the context of a trimeric S protein by trapping the up conformation. Because this up conformation is unstable and leads to S protein triggering, it is possible that this conformational trapping may at least partially contribute to the neutralization mechanisms of these VHHs.",

We found that when tips coated with the MERS-CoV RBD were dipped into MERS VHH55 before being dipped into DPP4, there was no increase in response that could be attributed to receptor binding. When tips coated with the MERS-CoV RBD were dipped into SARS VHH-72 and then DPP4, a robust response signal was observed, as expected. Similar results were observed when the analogous experiments were performed using the SARS-CoV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, SARS VHH-72, and ACE2 ( Figure 5D ).

Moreover, SARS VHH-72 did not neutralize SARS-CoV-2 S vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudoviruses, possibly because of the high dissociation rate constant, although it readily neutralized SARS-CoV-1 pseudotyped reporter viruses (Figures 6A-6D) . In an attempt to compensate for this rapid dissociation, we engineered two bivalent variants of SARS VHH-72. These included a tail-to-head fusion of two SARS VHH-72 molecules connected by a (GGGGS) 3 linker (VHH-72-VHH-72) and a genetic fusion of SARS VHH-72 to the Fc domain of human IgG1 (VHH-72-Fc) ( Figures S6A-S6C) . These bivalent SARS VHH-72 constructs bound to both prefusion SARS-CoV-1 S and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 as demonstrated by ELISA and by a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 to the ACE2 receptor on Vero E6 cells (Figures 6C-6D; Figures S6B and S6C) . We also detected binding of both of these constructs to full-length SARS-CoV-1 S and SARS-CoV-2 S expressed on the surface of mammalian cells ( Figures S6D and S6E ). Supernatants of HEK293S cells transiently transfected with VHH-72-Fc exhibited neutralizing activity against both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S VSV pseudoviruses in the same assay, which showed no such cross-reactive neutralization for monovalent SARS VHH-72 (Figures 6E and 6F) . A BLI experiment measuring binding of VHH-72-Fc to immobilized SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 further confirmed that bivalency was able to compensate for the high dissociation constant of the monomer ( Figure 7A ). Furthermore, the crossneutralizing VHH-72-Fc construct reached expression levels of 300 mg/L in ExpiCHO cells ( Figure 7B ). Using VHH-72-Fc purified from ExpiCHO cells and a SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped VSV with a luciferase reporter, we evaluated the neutralization capacity of VHH-72-Fc and found that it neutralized pseudovirus with an IC 50 of approximately 0.2 mg/mL ( Figure 7C ).",

These VHHs bind to the spike RBDs with high affinity and are capable of neutralizing S pseudotyped viruses in vitro. To our knowledge, the isolation and characterization of SARS-CoV-1 Binding curves are colored black, and fit of the data to a 1:1 binding model is colored red. (B) The crystal structure of SARS VHH-72 bound to the SARS-CoV-1 RBD is shown with SARS VHH-72 as dark blue ribbons and the RBD as a pink molecular surface. Amino acids that vary between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are colored green. ll S-directed VHHs have not been described before. Several MERS-CoV S-specific VHHs have been described, all of which have been directed against the RBD. Several of these VHHs have also been reported to block DPP4 binding, much like MERS VHH-55 (Stalin Raj et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018) . By solving the crystal structures of these newly isolated VHHs in complex with their respective viral targets, we provide detailed insights into epitope binding and their mechanisms of neutralization.",

            "text": "A number of RBD-directed conventional antibodies that are capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV have been described. The epitope of MERS VHH-55 overlaps with the epitopes of several of these MERS-CoV RBD-directed antibodies including C2, MCA1, m336, JC57-14, D12, 4C2, and MERS-27 Li et al., 2015; Ying et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2015) (Figure S7A ). The epitope of SARS VHH-72 does not significantly overlap with the epitopes of any previously described antibodies other than that of the recently described CR3022, which can also bind to the RBDs of both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S (Hwang et al., 2006; Pak et al., 2009; Prabakaran et al., 2006; Walls et al., 2019; Yuan et al., 2020) (Figure S7B ). However, unlike SARS VHH-72, CR3022 does not prevent the binding of ACE2 and it lacks neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 (Tian et al., 2020; Yuan et al., 2020) . This discrepancy in function, despite the partially overlapping epitope, is likely due to the different angles of approach that these two antibodies adopt ( Figure S7C ). Because SARS VHH-72 binds with a nanomolar K D to a portion The SARS-CoV-1 spike (PDB ID: 5X58) is shown as a transparent molecular surface, with each protomer colored either white, gray, or pink. Every monomer is bound by a copy of SARS VHH-72, shown as dark blue ribbons. The clashes between copies of SARS VHH-72 and the two neighboring spike monomers are highlighted by the red circle. (C) The SARS-CoV-2 spike (PDB ID: 6VXX) is shown as a transparent molecular surface, with each protomer colored either white, gray, or green. Every monomer is bound by a copy of SARS VHH-72, shown as dark blue ribbons. The clashes between copies of SARS VHH-72 and the two neighboring spike monomers are highlighted by the red circle. The SARS-CoV-2 trimer appears smaller than SARS-CoV-1 S because of the absence of flexible NTD-distal loops, which could not be built during cryo-EM analysis. (D) CoV VHHs prevent MERS-CoV RBD, SARS-CoV-1 RBD, and SARS-CoV-2 RBD-SD1 from interacting with their receptors. The results of the BLI-based receptor-blocking experiment are shown. The legend lists the immobilized RBDs and the VHHs or receptors that correspond to each curve. of the SARS-CoV-1 S RBD that exhibits low sequence variation, as demonstrated by its cross-reactivity with the WIV1-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, it may broadly bind S proteins from other SARS-CoV-like viruses. We show that by engineering a bivalent VHH-72-Fc construct, we can compensate for the relatively high off-rate constant of the monovalent SARS VHH-72. This bivalent molecule expresses well in transiently transfected ExpiCHO cells (~300 mg/L) and can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 S pseudoviruses in vitro. Future panning efforts using existing libraries and SARS-CoV-2 S may yield even more potent neutralizers.",

HIV-and influenza-directed VHHs have been reported previously, and there are multiple RSV-directed VHHs that have been evaluated (Detalle et al., 2015; Iba\u00f1 ez et al., 2011; Koch et al., 2017; Rossey et al., 2017) . The possibility of administering these molecules via a nebulized spray is particularly attractive in the case of respiratory pathogens because the VHHs could theoretically be inhaled directly to the site of infection in an effort to maximize bioavailability and function (Larios Mora et al., 2018) . Because of the current lack of treatments for MERS, SARS, and COVID-19 and the devastating effects associated with pandemic coronavirus outbreaks, both prophylactic and therapeutic interventions are sorely needed. It is our hope that because of their favorable biophysical properties and their potent neutralization capacity, MERS VHH-55, SARS VHH-72, and VHH-72-Fc may serve as both useful reagents for researchers and as potential therapeutic candidates.

The sequences of MERS resuspended in 250 mL TES buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 M sucrose) and incubated at 4 C for 30 min. Subsequently 350 mL water was added to induce an osmotic shock. After 1 h incubation at 4 C followed by centrifugation, the periplasmic extract was collected. VHH-containing periplasmic extracts were then tested for binding to either MERS-CoV S-2P or SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein. Briefly, in the PE-ELISA screen after panning on MERS-CoV S-2P protein, wells of microtiter plates (type II, F96 Maxisorp, Nuc) were coated overnight at 37 C with 100 ng MERS-CoV S-2P (without foldon), MERS-CoV S-2P protein (with foldon) or as negative controls coated with SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein (with foldon), HCoV-HKU1 S-2P (without foldon), DS-Cav1 (with foldon) or bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich). In the PE-ELISA screen after panning on SARS-CoV-1 S protein wells of microtiter plates (type II, F96 Maxisorp, Nuc) were coated with 100 ng SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein (with foldon), SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein captured with an anti-foldon antibody (with foldon) or as negative controls coated with MERS-CoV S-2P (without foldon), HCoV-HKU1 S-2P (without foldon), DS-Cav1 (with foldon) or bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich). The coated plates were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS and 50 mL of the periplasmic extract was added to the wells. Bound VHHs were detected with anti-HA (1/2,000, MMS-101P Biolegend) mAb followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-linked anti-mouse IgG (1/2,000, NXA931, GE Healthcare). Periplasmic fractions, for which the OD 450 value of the antigen coated wells were at least two times higher than the OD 450 value of the BSA coated wells, were considered to be specific for the coated antigen and selected for sequencing. The selected clones were grown in 3 mL of LB medium with 100 mg/mL ampicillin. The DNA of the selected colonies was isolated using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (QIAGEN) and sequenced using the MP057 primer (5 0 -TTATGCTTCCGGCTCGTATG-3 0 ).",

In the vector, the VHH sequences contain a C-terminal 6x His-tag, are under the control of the methanol inducible AOX1 promotor and in frame with a modified version of the S.cerevisae a-mating factor prepro signal sequence. The vector contains a Zeocine resistance marker for selection in bacteria as well as in yeast cells. The VHH encoding sequences were amplified by PCR using the following forward and reverse primer (5 0 -GGCGGGTATCTCTCGA GAAAAGGCAGGTGCAGCTGCAGGAGTCTGGG-3 0 ) and (5 0 -CTAACTAGTCTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGGTGGCTGGAGACGGTGAC CTGG-3 0 ) and cloned between the XhoI and SpeI sites in the pKai61 vector. The vectors were linearized by PmeI and transformed in the Pichia pastoris strain GS115 by electroporation at 1500 V using a Gene Pulser electroporator (Bio-Rad) (Lin-Cereghino et al., 2005) . After transformation, the yeast cells were plated on YPD plates (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) dextrose and 2% (w/v) agar) supplemented with zeocin (100 mg/mL) for selection.",

About 10 11 phages were added to the coated well and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Non-specifically bound phages were removed by washing with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (10 times in the first panning round and 15 times in the second panning round). The retained phages were eluted with TEA-solution (14% trimethylamine (Sigma) pH 10) and subsequently neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl pH 8. The collected phages were amplified in exponentially growing E.coli TG1 cells, infected with VCS M13 helper phages and subsequently purified using PEG 8,000/NaCl precipitation for the next round of selection. Enrichment after each panning round was determined by infecting TG1 cells with 10-fold serial dilutions of the collected phages after which the bacteria were plated on LB agar plates with 100 mg/mL \u00c0 ampicillin and 1% glucose. Phages displaying SARS-CoV-1 directed VHHs were enriched after 2 rounds of biopanning on 20 mg of SARS-CoV-1 S-2P protein captured with an anti-foldon antibody (generously provided by Dr. Vicente Mas) in one well of a microtiter plate",
