Globally, until April 5, 2020, there have been reported 12,03,485 confirmed cases and 62,000 deaths.[2,3] India has reported 3577 cases till date. The coronavirus may cause various respiratory infection such as coughing, sneezing, pneumonia, fever, breathlessness, and lung infection. The disease is transmitted by direct contact with infected droplets and the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days. COVID 19 is mild in most peoples in some elderly peoples having underlying medical problem such as diabetes, chronic respiratory disorders, and cardiovascular disease are more possible to develop severe illness such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiorgan dysfunction.[4,5]",

Supportive treatment may include administration of antipyretic and analgesic for fever and cough, maintenance of hydration and nutrition, and mechanical ventilation and even extra corporeal membrane oxygen as respiratory support may be needed. Renal replacement therapy may be needed in some instant and use of antibiotics and antifungal is necessary if coinfections are proven.[28-32] Antiviral drugs such as ribavirin, lopinavir/ ritonavir have been used based on the experience with SARS and MERS. In a historical control study in patients with SARS, patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir with ribavirin had better outcomes as compared to those given ribavirin alone.[33] Apart from this, remdesivir,[34,35] chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, nucleoside derivatives, neuraminidase inhibitors, and peptide EK1 can also be the choices of antiviral drugs for COVID-19 treatment.[36] Still health professionals were not fully satisfied with any therapy so further clinical research needed.",

Recently, several studies have been published exploring the origin, taxonomy/ microbiology, causes, clinical look and diagnosis, and prevention and control of the novel coronavirus. Thus far, most studies have focused on the epidemiology and potential causes. Thus, most of studies were focus on epidemiology and potential causes. Researches in this area are urgently required to reduce the impact of the epidemic. Coronavirus mainly transmitted through airborne droplets of infected person having sneezing and coughing. Hence, avoid contact and separate them if observed symptoms. As per the WHO and ECDC guidelines, stay away from with sick person. Potential research needed to prevent future outbreaks of zoonotic origin. Till only \u201cSocial Distancing\u201d is best vaccine against COCID-19.",
