In this study, the respiratory health of children was assessed in the capital city of India where the level of air pollution is much above the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The study was carried out in Delhi, and the findings were compared with those of rural West Bengal and Uttaranchal. The prevalence of respiratory symptoms was determined through a structured respiratory symptomlogy questionnaire and personal interviews. Air quality data were collected from Central and State Pollution Control Boards and also obtained by direct measurements using a portable aerosol monitor. Based on the data collected on the cohort of children participating in this study, 32.1% of children in Delhi suffered from respiratory problems in contrast to 18.2% of rural children (control). The respiratory symptoms were more prevalent in girls than in boys. A strong, statistically significant positive association was observed between PM 10 level in Delhi's air and the prevalence of lower respiratory tract symptoms.",

Of all these pollutants, the association between air pollution and adverse health conditions is strongest and most consistent for respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) with an aerodynamic diameter <10 \u03bcm (PM 10 ). The health risk from particulate pollution is high for some susceptible groups such as the children and the elderly persons, and those with diseases of the heart and lungs (Ulrich et al. 2002) .",

Respiratory symptoms are classified into two broad groups: (1) upper respiratory symptoms (URS), which include running and stuffy nose, sinusitis, sore throat, cold head, fever, and burning or red eyes, and (2) lower respiratory symptoms (LRS), which include wheezing, wet cough, dry cough, phlegm, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort or pain. Most of the respiratory diseases underlying these symptoms are caused by bacterial, fungal, or viral infections or by structural or functional damage to the respiratory system.

Air pollution is viewed as a serious problem in Delhi. The Indian capital has the dubious distinction of being one of the most polluted cities in the world. In 2005, Delhi had an annual average concentration of RSPM, i.e., PM 10 , of 163.4 \u03bcg/m 3 , which was 2.7-fold higher the Indian standards for residential areas (60 \u03bcg/m 3 ). The major sources of the city's air pollution are road traffic (72%), industrial emissions (20%), and emissions from household activities (8%) (Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India 2007). Soil resuspension is also an important source of air pollution in the city (Balachandran et al. 2000) .

Using multivariate logistic regression analysis after controlling for potential confounders, such as parental smoking and SES, we found that particulate pollution was positively associated with all six symptoms of LRS. The strongest association was for sleep disturbance due to breathing trouble and dry cough, followed by chest pain or discomfort, breathlessness on exertion, cough with sputum production, and wheeze. In essence, the prevalence of LRS increases with increasing concentrations of particulate pollution in the breathing air. The sample areas were divided into different homogeneous strata based on air pollution level (in \u03bcg/m 3 : 50-75; 76-100; 101-125; 126-150; >150). Taking the prevalence of individual symptoms at the low pollution level (PM 10 = 50-70 \u03bcg/m 3 ) as the constant (OR 1) in the conditional regression analysis, the prevalence of LRS symptoms was found to be doubled or tripled when the particulate pollution level was elevated (PM 10 >125 \u03bcg/m 3 ; Table 6 ).",

The concentration of PM 10 was least in South Delhi, and this was reflected by the lowest prevalence of RSC among the residents of this part of the city. Respiratory symptoms, both URS and LRS, were more prevalent during the winter followed by the summer and monsoon, which again corresponds with the concentration of PM, which was highest during the winter and lowest during the monsoon. The prevalence of RSC varied with seasons, again showing links to PM 10 level as the level of PM 10 was lowest during the monsoon and highest during the winter. Another important confounder was SES, with the lower the SES, the higher the prevalence of RSC. Poverty and lower social status are associated with a large family size, crowded living conditions, poorer access to medical care, higher smoking rates, nutritional deficits, and exposure to environmental pollutants, including urban air pollution and stressful living environments. These factors may contribute individually or perhaps interact among themselves to increase the susceptibility to respiratory diseases. During the statistical evaluation, the confounder, i.e, SES, was taken into account and controlled for.",

            "text": "Upper and lower respiratory symptoms, which were found in excess in children of Delhi, could be a fall-out of a greater interaction of the airways with allergens and pathogens and/or impairment in lung defense. A review of the literature on possible associations between air pollution and respiratory symptoms in children revealed that outdoor and indoor air pollution are positively associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children (Chauhan et al. 2005) . Available evidence conclusively supports the association between outdoor air pollution, including PM 10 , PM 2.5 , NO 2 , SO 2 , and ozone, and increased upper and lower respiratory symptoms in children. Many of these symptoms are related to infections. Viral and bacterial infections can cause severe pathological abnormalities in both the upper and lower respiratory tract, with the extent of epithelial damage varying with the pathogen type. In particular, the lower airway epithelium between the bronchial and alveolar regions is more susceptible than the nasal, laryngeal and tracheal regions. It is possible that the penetration of pathogens into the epithelium could be facilitated by both epithelial shedding and reduced ciliary clearance, resulting in easier access of the pathogen to antigen-presenting cells and, consequently, leading to increased inflammation. Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are divided into two main groups; upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). The risk of severe ARIs is greatest in very young children and in the elderly. The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined URTIs as a combination of symptoms that include one or more of the following; cough with or without fever, blocked or running The results are expressed as the percentage of affected children with the respective symptom Results are presented as the OR with 95% CI in parenthesis nose, sore throat and ear discharge (World Health Organization 1997) . URTIs are usually viral in origin and include the common cold viruses, such as rhinoviruses and corona viruses. In contrast, LRTIs involve infections of the lung and are associated with symptoms like cough and dyspnea, bronchitis, and pneumonia, which usually present in serious forms. URTIs and LRTIs are not mutually exclusive; they frequently coexist during the same episode of respiratory infections. Bacteria and viruses cause infection in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and upper respiratory infections are often followed or accompanied by lower respiratory infections (Chauhan et al. 2005 ). There has been a series of studies investigating the link between URTIs and air pollution. An increase in total suspended particle and NO 2 levels of 10 and 70 \u03bcg/m 3 , respectively, was found to be associated with a 27 and 28% increase in cases of laryngo-tracheo-bronchitis (Schwartz et al. 1991) . Traffic-related air pollution and the risk of respiratory diseases in a cohort of 4,000 children were investigated in the Netherlands, and a positive association was observed between air pollution and URTIs. A study in the UK investigated the association between the number of general practitioner consultations for upper respiratory tract diseases, excluding allergic rhinitis, and outdoor air pollution. In children aged 0-14 years, a 3.5-fold increase in the number of such consultations was observed for an increase in SO 2 levels of between 13 and 31 \u03bcg/m 3 (Hajat et al. 1999 (Hajat et al. , 2002 . In another study in Taiwan, Hwang and Chan (2002) observed a 0.3-1.3% increase in the number of consultations with physicians with a 10% increase in the levels of NO 2 , SO 2 , and PM 10 . In a cross-sectional study in ten different areas of Switzerland in children aged 6-15 years, the risk of bronchitis between the most and least polluted areas was found to be significant with an OR of 2.17 for PM 10 (Braun-Fahrlander et al. 1997 ). It is therefore quite possible that air pollution may modify symptoms in children who are already infected.",

It can significantly impact a child's health, as it impairs the quality of life, and it can predispose to the development of co-morbidities, such as asthma (Meltzer 2006) . The poor air quality of Delhi may account for these symptoms because a close relationship exists between outdoor air pollution and sinusitis (Wolf 2002) . Exposure to fungal spores, such as those of Alternaria, could also elicit these symptoms (Delfino et al. 2002) .
