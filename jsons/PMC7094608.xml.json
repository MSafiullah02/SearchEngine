Host factors include severity of airflow obstruction (FEV1 < 35% of predicted), need for home oxygen, use of chronic steroid therapy, frequency of exacerbations (four or more per year), and presence of comorbid medical conditions such as congestive heart failure. The choice of antibiotics is generally guided by the severity of exacerbation, presence of risk factors, and the type of pathogens expected.12\n13 Several studies in the pre-1990s era did not show a difference in the treatment outcome based on the choice of antibiotics.11 However, there is great concern over recent reports of increasing resistance to the most commonly used first-line antibiotics among the bacterial pathogens such as H influenzae and S pneumoniae.14\n15 In one retrospective study, the use of newer antibiotics reduced the failure and hospitalization rate when compared to first-line antibiotics.16 In a second study, treatment with amoxicillin was associated with a higher failure rate when compared to other antibiotics.17 In a prospective study, the use of ciprofloxacin as compared to the usual antibiotics, in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic bronchitis who had four or more exacerbations, was associated with improved outcome.18 In general, the results of multiple studies demonstrate that patients who have lower FEV1 values, who require more intensive therapy with bronchodilators and steroids, and patients who have not responded to treatment on prior episodes of acute exacerbations are more likely to relapse within the next 14 to 30 days, as compared to patients with more favorable parameters.11\n",

Benefits of using a stratified treatment approach would allow the use of less expensive, narrow-spectrum antibiotics for patients with simple chronic bronchitis, while reserving the more expensive, second-line, broad-spectrum antibiotics for patients who are at greater risk for relapse or hospitalization. In a recent prospective trial, the use of ofloxacin demonstrated a significant benefit in the treatment of COPD exacerbations in patients requiring mechanical ventilation.20 The selective use of second-line antibiotics could also limit the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens. Although there are no prospective randomized controlled trials to demonstrate that the Canadian guidelines are more effective than usual care, it makes intuitive sense that a stratified treatment approach that restricts the use of the newer broad-spectrum antibiotics is likely to be cost- effective and benefit patients with moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations.",

Patients in the PNAE group had significantly higher rates of abrupt onset of illness, fever, and increased frequency of rales with more severe hypoxemia, as compared to the patients in NPAE group. Although clinically not significant, there was also a trend toward higher frequency of type 1 exacerbation (all three symptoms) in the PNAE group (70% vs 51%).

First and foremost, this is the only study in the literature that has compared PNAE vs NPAE of COPD. Second, serology was the only diagnostic test that was used exclusively in this study for the diagnosis of the 12 pathogens (7 viral, 3 bacterial, and 2 atypical bacterial agents). Although blood cultures were done, sputum culture or other respiratory secretion cultures were not performed. Furthermore, the authors emphasize the virtues of serology in the diagnosis of pneumococcal infections, viral infections, and atypical bacterial pathogens in their study. The incidence of both viral and atypical pathogens was high in both the groups, despite the exclusion of common cold viruses (coronavirus and rhinovirus) and C pneumoniae infection due to technical difficulty with their assays. Perhaps the data from this study can be viewed in a different light. The use of serology offers an alternate option that is complimentary to conventional methods for making a diagnosis of these pathogens. However, the limitation of serology in the diagnosis of infectious causes is well recognized in the literature. Data from serologic tests are retrospective and are only useful in epidemiologic studies. Serology is generally not helpful in the prospective management of patients with community-acquired pneumonia and is not recommended by the American Thoracic Society guidelines.21\n",

Both viral and bacterial etiologies were significantly higher in the pneumonic group. The significance of parainfluenzae virus type 2 and adenovirus in the PNAE group is not well understood. Fourth, the frequency of H influenzae and M catarrhalis infection, as reported by serology, was much lower in this study as compared to the literature. The authors acknowledge the limitation of serology in the diagnosis of these two pathogens and caution the readers about not making any therapeutic decisions based on the results of serology in their study. Fifth, the incidence of atypical pathogens (Legionella species, M pneumoniae) was similar between the two groups of patients.

Should patients with COPD exacerbations who demonstrate an infiltrate on a chest radiograph be \u201clumped together\u201d with patients without an infiltrate? The authors take a stand that the presence of an infiltrate on a chest radiograph in a patient with COPD should not be used to exclude them from a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD for two reasons: (1) initial symptoms of increased dyspnea, increased sputum purulence, and volume cannot be used to differentiate clinically between the two groups except with a chest radiograph; and (2) the majority of the patients who are treated in the outpatient setting do not have a chest radiograph. However, one can argue that the presence of an infiltrate on the chest radiograph is the only key element that helps to differentiate between the two groups. The utility of a chest radiograph in a patient with suspected pneumonia is to confirm the clinical impression, determine the extent of radiographic involvement (unilobar vs multilobar), and identify any complications such as pleural effusion or bronchial obstruction. The results of their study, although small, clearly demonstrate worse outcomes in the PNAE group as compared to the NPAE group, with higher morbidity and mortality.",

Given the limitation of serology and because this study was not designed to address this issue, it is evident that no therapeutic decisions can be made based on the results of this study. Further studies designed to assess the type and frequency of infection by both serology and conventional respiratory cultures, along with documentation of the clinical risk factors and treatment outcomes, are required to address this issue. Until then, we should continue to obtain chest radiographs in patients with COPD exacerbations in whom pneumonia is suspected, or if they are being considered for hospital admission. Confirmation of an infiltrate on a chest radiograph warrants treatment approach as per American Thoracic Society guidelines for community- acquired pneumonia. The choice of antibiotics in patients with COPD exacerbations in the absence of pneumonia should be guided by the severity of exacerbation, the presence of risk factors, and expected bacterial pathogens with local susceptibility and resistance patterns.",
