Human bocavirus (HBoV) was detected in respiratory tract samples of Swedish infants and children (7) and since then, has been detected worldwide (8, 9, 10).

            "text": "In conclusion, although RSV was the most frequent agent in patients with diagnosis of bronchiolitis in winter, other viruses were present in 47% of the cases. Clinical characteristics were similar amongst them, with small variations but seasonality was clearly different. HBoV appears mainly in December and spring, hMPV in spring and HRV in fall. Single infections were frequent and support the pathogenic role of these viruses in acute viral bronchiolitis. Dual and multiple detection of different viruses in patients with acute bronchiolitis was obtained in nearly a quarter of the patients without further severe clinical characteristics. Children with RSV\u2010single infection needed treatment in the intensive care unit more frequently than others. The multiplex RT\u2010nested PCR described in this study provides a rapid, sensitive and specific approach to diagnose the most important viruses involved in bronchiolitis in one reaction tube, yielding relevant information for patient management and treatment, if applicable.",
