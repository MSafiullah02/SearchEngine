(2011) note that \"social resilience [\u2026] is inherently a multilevel construct, revealed by capacities of individuals and groups to respectively foster, engage in, and sustain positive social relationships and to endure and recover from stressors and social isolation.\" In other words, social resilience serves as a metaphor for the ability of individuals and communities to adapt, reorganize, and improve in the midst of external shocks and stresses (Norris et al. 2008; Pelling 2012) . However, regardless of an individual or collective focus relative to social resilience, phenomena systems focus is essential where even individual resilience is strongly influence by social and physical factors \"outside\" of the particular individual (Sippel et al. 2015) .",

Specifically, the actions of such stakeholders may mitigate or exacerbate such disruptions based upon the public's awareness of the challenge and to its relevant response strategies, which find expression in (i) the resources and readiness committed to promoting resilience for a given system and community, (ii) the priorities defined and the risks evaluated and (iii) the efforts at crafting effective involvement and risk communication to align community actions, reactive or preventive. Based upon the system and community in question, such stakeholders may range from the communities at large to local, regional, and national as well as policymakers and decision makers, where specific focus must be levied upon engaging the correct and relevant stakeholders to prepare for and recover from adverse events. In this way, stakeholder engagement is an essential element of promoting social resilience in response to various adverse events and system stresses, and serves as a key task in aligning incentives and unifying members of government, industry, and the lay public to address potential or ongoing challenges that may otherwise generate lasting harms to given communities.",

Specifically, this chapter includes the perspectives of various participants of the Social Resilience Working Group, which was tasked with the goal of addressing (i) the purpose and definition of social resilience, (ii) how social resilience is fostered, and (iii) challenges that complicate social resilience or otherwise must be considered for future work in the field. In this respect, the Working Group discussed social resilience as comprising both 'resilient societies' as well as 'the actions and involvement of key social groups to improve resilience of systems from engineering applications'. As such, this chapter begins with a general review of social resilience and resilient societies, and then reviews how social mechanisms such as stakeholder engagement are critical to promote system resilience for ecological or infrastructural applications.",

Unpacking such discussion, 'shocks' include those events that generate unexpected and fast-acting effects upon individuals or communities within a particular area (Mitchell and Harris 2012) . Typically referred to as 'one-off events', or in situations of high uncertainty and surprise 'black swans', shocks are characterized by the relatively rapid manner in which they appear and subside (although their resulting impact can cause long-lasting damage). From a climatological perspective, examples of such shocks include Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy in the United States, which made landfall on certain coastal communities and dramatically damaged local economies and public health over an extended period.",

Rather than overwhelm existing infrastructural and systemic resources within a brief period, such stresses act slowly to reduce such system's efficiencies and abilities to perform at a high level. Examples here include challenges from climate change, which can hinder agricultural output and community wellbeing over time without proper protections and countermeasures. Other examples may include the effect of mass migration upon society, where gradual effects can stress infrastructural systems in the absence of a plan to accommodate a large influx of people. While stresses generally may not possess dramatic adverse effects within a short period, the consequences of such gradual effects may be equally challenging to societal resilience and the ability of respective communities to absorb and recover from potential threats and problems over time.",

Within the concept of panarchy, a systemic shock or stress may generate cascading effects and feedback loops that overwhelm system capacities to absorb and recover from adverse events. Panarchy serves as a framework for a complex series of interaction effects that, without a contextually rich and thorough understanding of how a given system interacts and operates with other infrastructural and societal elements, can greatly exacerbate the damages wrought by shocks and stresses over time.

For the former, the system seeks to preserve itself by adapting to adverse events and recovering to near or total efficiency over a period of time (Walker et al. 2004; Briske et al. 2010) . Further, such systems are considered resilient to a varying degree to those particular shocks or stresses (predictable or unpredictable), where they possess the ability to weather such challenges without completely collapsing and inducing permanent damage to social function. While often discussed as being an inherently positive trait within published literature, this is not necessarily always true, where a resilient system may be harmful or a reinforcing social trap in nature (Palma-Oliveira and Trump 2016).",

In turn, this requires, based on the magnitude of damage caused by the disruption: (i) the existence of precise plan of recovery, (ii) pre-defined responsibilities, and (iii) sets of relevant operational actions to ensure control and reduction of damages. In each of these considerations, there exists a clear need for systems analysis techniques in various planning and construction phases to tackle aforementioned problems (Moy et al. 1986 ). For instance, systems analysis may help to simulate possible hydrologic conditions and various operational scenarios to control water flows into and from reservoirs (McMahon et al. 2006 ). With such analysis, social impacts may be weighted to be of high importance, including consideration of time intervals to determine shifting social priorities and/or infrastructural functions to meet the demands of local economic, health, and social needs (Srdjevic and Srdjevic 2016).",

Simply focusing on combating disease may help stave off a larger epidemic and reduce the rate of incidence, but ignoring social factors and not communicating clearly with the public may still generate disastrous economic, social, and medical harms (Davtyan et al. 2014) . One example of this includes the 2014 outbreak of the ebolavirus, where poor communication and networking by governments with the public not only caused significant damage to the local economy, but also instilled mistrust by locals and health workers of the government's effort to combat the virus (Torabi-Parizi et al. 2015) . Another example includes HIV/AIDS, where limited public engagement, risk communication, or consideration of social factors directly contributed to the increased stigma of HIV positive individuals and discouraged many from seeking treatment at the end of the twentieth century (Vega 2016) . Internationally, similar observations were noted with the SARS epidemic in China, where a mistrust of local government caused many to refuse to seek medical care and contributed to a more lasting outbreak of the disease (Chan et al. 2016) .",

Such considerations may include public awareness and risk communication drives, the allocation of financial and physical resources to be activated before and in the event of an emergency, and well-established and distributed safety guidelines and best practices, among others. With such preparation, local and national governments may be able to limit the negative social impacts that inevitably arise from consequential shocks to energy, medical, environmental, or economic infrastructure, and may help reduce recovery time in the aftermath of the event in question.",

Currently, such methods and regulatory approaches are limited in scope . Similarly, Larkin et al. (2015) noted that as of 2015, few methodological approaches of resilience analysis were formally used to facilitate risk assessment within United States government agencies. However, Larkin et al. (2015) did state that many agencies have begun experimenting with prototypical resilience models for local and regional governments and communities, where such methods may become more standardized and mandatory as their use is proven beneficial for bolstering various elements of social and infrastructural resilience.",
