A thermally comfortable, healthy, and productive enclosed environment is very important for occupants. Such an environment is typically achieved by controlling the air temperature, relative humidity, air speed, and chemical species concentrations in enclosed spaces with heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. The energy used by HVAC systems accounts for over 40% of the total energy consumption in buildings in the United States [2]. In transportation vehicles such as medium- and large-sized commercial aircrafts, the operating power of HVAC systems in a 400-passenger airliner is as high as 350 kW, which is about 75% of all non-propulsive energy consumption on board [3].",

This syndrome is frequently attributed to flaws in HVAC systems. Other possible causes related to indoor air quality are volatile organic compounds from building material outgassing, molds, and light industrial chemicals used in factories [6], [7]. During overseas flights on commercial airliners, up to half of the passengers typically experience health problems, with 5% of them requiring medical attention [8]. Respiratory diseases in particular can be transmitted in an airliner cabin [9]. For example, among the 120 passengers on a flight from Hong Kong to Beijing in 2003, 22 were infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [10], and in 2009 the H1N1-A virus spread to 76 countries on six continents within a month and a half [11].

A designer may have to assume an HVAC system for the environment according to his/her experience. The system's ability to produce the desired thermal comfort and indoor air quality level will then be evaluated through the distribution characteristics of air temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, and contaminant concentrations in the enclosed environment by using analytical and empirical models, computer simulations, or by means of experimental measurements [13]. By adjusting the HVAC system parameters iteratively on the basis of the evaluation results, the designer can achieve a desired enclosed environment. However, this trial-and-error process may involve a large number of iterations between the initial and final designs, highly depending on the designer's knowledge and experience. If a sophisticated performance evaluation tool is used, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), the design process can take days or weeks, but the resulting enclosed environment may still not meet the design objective.",

This method was first used to solve ill-posed partial differential equations for heat conduction problems [15]. It was also used to solve the inverse heat conduction in a quasi-boundary-value-problem variant of the original formulation [21]. Later, the method was applied to identify groundwater contaminant sources [22]. To identify a contaminant source by using the contaminant information detected by a sensor, one could inversely solve the governing species transport Equation (1). The inversion to Eq. (1) is ill-posed because the time-forward process is dispersive and an inversion to a dispersive process is unstable. The quasi-reversibility method replaces the most unstable diffusion term with a fourth-order term, as shown in Eq. (2)\n[23]. Then the equation can be solved reversibly.(1)\u2202\u03c8\u2202t+\u2202\u2202xi(ui\u03c8)=\u2202\u2202xi(\u0393\u03c8\u2202\u03c8\u2202xi)\n(2)\u2202\u03c8\u2202\u03c4+\u2202\u2202xi(ui\u03c8)=\u03b5\u22024\u03c8\u2202xi4where \u03c8 is the species concentration, t is forward time, i.e., \u0394t > 0, x\ni is the coordinate, u\ni is a velocity component, \u0393\u03c8 is the diffusion coefficient, \u03c4 is backward time, i.e., \u0394\u03c4 < 0, and \u03b5 is stabilization coefficient which determines the strength of stabilized operation.",

The contaminant concentration distribution at t = 6 s provided by a forward CFD simulation, as shown in Fig. 2(b), was used as the initial condition to conduct the inverse simulation.

Although the contaminant strength calculated by the inverse method becomes dispersive, the location of the contaminant source can be identified. The quasi-reversibility method was also extended to inversely locate an airborne particle source [24]. The quasi-reversibility method requires a known flow field as the priori, because Eq. (2) is only for the species concentration. However, if a design of an enclosed environment also requires the inverse prediction of the flow field, this method is not applicable.",

Since the matrix is ill-posed, a regularized matrix L is added, and the strength of the regularized operation is controlled by a regularized coefficient \u03bb\n[17], [30]. With an appropriate \u03bb, the release rate q can be solved once a C is provided (Eq. (4)). The cause-effect matrix A is a function of the flow, source, and sensor location.

The design procedure required only 16 adjustments of the design variables, automatically performed during a single computation.

GA optimizes the solution with evolution (or iteration) of the population. A fitness value (the value of the objective function) quantifies the \u201cgoodness\u201d of an individual.

This new method can converge to the global optimum in far fewer generations with lesser likelihood of falling into local optima. Genetic algorithms inherently tend to produce a set of proper solutions, and Karr et al.

Researchers have also attempted to increase the convergence speed without reducing the capability of a genetic algorithm in searching optimal global multi-solutions for multiple objectives.

Kato and Lee [80] applied a similar approach to optimizing a hybrid air-conditioning system with natural ventilation. Xue et al. [81] implemented the inverse prediction and optimization of flow control conditions for confined spaces. Further, Zhai et al. [82] optimized flow control conditions for a confined space (Fig. 5\n(a)) by satisfying multiple design indices, such as PMV, percentage dissatisfied with the draft (PD), and mean age of air. If the design objective is to have PMV = 0, PD < 15%, and mean age of air less than 125 s on the design domain represented by the circles in Fig. 5(a), then all points on the curve of PMV = 0 shown in Fig. 5(b) satisfy the first condition. The PMV = 0 and PD = 15% curves intersecting at point Q2 meet the second condition with a supply air velocity of 1.75 m/s and air temperature of 24.2 \u00b0C. The curve of the mean age of air at 125 s intersecting with the curve of PMV = 0 at Q1 satisfies the third condition with a supply air velocity of 1.11 m/s and air temperature of 22.69 \u00b0C. As a result, any design along the red line between Q1 and Q2 would meet the design objectives. Since the indoor environment design is a multi-variable, multi-solution, multi-objective problem, the genetic algorithm can identify the global optima. Nevertheless, the CFD-based genetic algorithm method requires many CFD simulations during the population evolution, and the computational effort increases by orders of magnitude with an increase in the number of the design variables. An optimal design of an indoor environment using GA can take a week or more to reach the final solutions, depending on the case sophistication and accuracy requirements.",

Citriniti and George [85] utilized the POD method to analyze the measurement data provided by a hotwire anemometry in a turbulent shear layer. Lam [86] used POD to construct the measured velocity and concentration distributions of a round jet. Early applications of the method for numerical fluid dynamics were for near-wall and jet-induced mixing flows [87], [88], [89]. Later, POD was applied to predict some basic fluid flows and heat transfer. For example, Cazemier et al. [90] used POD to construct a low-dimensional model for cavity-driven flows, in which 80 spatial modes were extracted from 700 snapshots. Couplet et al. [91] proposed a calibrated reduced-order POD-Galerkin model to predict the flows around a square cylinder and past a backward-facing step, respectively. Ding et al. [92] proposed the POD-based data interpolation strategy to predict the thermo-flow fields for natural convection and forced convection flows. Liberge and Hamdouni [93] investigated the dynamic flow induced by a rigid oscillating cylinder. The POD-based adaptive controller was also developed for real-time dynamic flow adjustment and prediction [94], [95].",

The supply air velocity and temperature in the green dot area of Fig. 6(b) can lead to satisfactory PMV in the head region. A full CFD simulation took approximately 8 h to solve a single case when providing the snapshot fields, while the POD required less than 2 s to construct a new case. This study used 40 CFD simulations to construct 2871 POD interpolations. The total computing time was 321 h, most of which was for the CFD simulations. If full CFD simulations were conducted, the computing time for 2871 CFD simulations would be 23,000 h. Thus, the POD method is very efficient.",

The backward method reverses the governing cause\u2013effect relationship to find the causes and thus the reversion is straightforward. Since the reversed cause\u2013effect relationship is ill posed, a regularization technique by adding extra terms to stabilize the inverse solution is required. However, the regularization destroys the original cause\u2013effect relationship and consequently only an approximate solution can be provided. The accuracy of the backward method varies with the problem and the strength of the added regularized operation. There is no iterative computation required except in some circumstances when searching for an optimal regularized parameter is necessary. Hence, the backward method can provide results more efficiently than the forward method.

Thus, this is an optimization approach. The solved governing equations are forward and well-posed, which has a solution and the solution is normally stable. Since a certain boundary condition would lead to one forward solution, an inverse design requires many trials with different boundary settings. An optimization technique like the adjoint method and genetic algorithm can be utilized to accelerate the search for a desired solution. The adjoint method is a gradient-based optimization, which may trap in a local optimum if no external interruption is imposed. The genetic algorithm searches for an optimal solution globally but at the expense of many solution trials, so it is computationally intensive based on CFD. The POD method presented in this paper does not utilize an optimization method. The POD provides a very quick cause-effect mapping based on the extracted spatial modes and interpolation of their coefficients. However, if the data used does not contain the characteristics of the desirable solution, the method would not be able to provide desirable design.

The forward methods in theory have the ability to find the air supply locations and parameters to achieve the flow in one single computation. The beauty of the forward methods is stable and solvable.

            "text": "To increase efficiency, one option is to use fast fluid dynamics (FFD) [104] as a substitute for CFD. FFD solves NS equation by using a three-step, time-advancement scheme [105] that splits the momentum equation into three discretized equations. FFD first solves the advection term by a semi-Lagrangian approach [106] and then solve the source and diffusion term with an implicit scheme. Finally, FFD solves the pressure term and continuity equation together by using a pressure-projection method. By combining the solution of the three discretized equations, the method could get a final answer for the NS equation. The algorithm that does not require iteration so the computing speed is fast. It was initiated for computer game industry that seeks speed rather than accuracy. After further development by our team, FFD is also rather accurate now [107], [108], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114]. According to Zuo and Chen [104], FFD can be 50 times faster than CFD and can predict the flow field with acceptable accuracy. Another option is to replace the CFD simulation with an artificial neural network. Zhou and Haghighat [115] combined a genetic algorithm and artificial neural network to optimize ventilation systems in office spaces. Boithias et al. [116] also proposed a genetic-algorithm-based method to optimize the architecture, training parameters, and inputs of an artificial neural network for predicting energy use and indoor discomfort during building control optimization. However, the use of an artificial neural network instead of CFD would increase the uncertainty and the risk of accumulative error [117]. To solve this problem, Zhang and You [118] used both an artificial neural network and CFD to obtain the design objectives of new individuals. This integrated method could ensure accuracy in calculating the design objectives and reduce computational costs by 65%.",

Giannakoglou et al. [119] developed the combined genetic method for the optimal design of aerodynamic shapes. The genetic algorithm was used for the initial design, and the adjoint method was applied for fine tuning, leading to faster convergence. The integrated CFD-based GA and adjoint method can be much faster than the pure CFD-based GA. In addition, the integrated method can find the global optima, thus overcoming the shortcomings of the pure CFD-based adjoint method. Xue et al. [120] combined the genetic algorithm with the adjoint method and revealed that this new integrated method is at great advantage when the number of variables for optimization is large.",

The backward methods can provide an approximate inverse solution efficiently. Hence, the inverse solution from the backward methods may be input into the forward methods as the initial guess of the final solution. Then the forward methods are employed to further improve the solution accuracy. The above strategy may shorten the time spent in circumscribing the rough ranges of design variables that satisfy the design targets. Such a scenario is viable at least for inverse identification of species sources. For example, Zhang et al. [121] backwardly determined the pollutant source release rates at all possible source locations first and then identified the correct source in a forward matching process.",

In principle, the methods presented in this paper can be extended to account for each individual's demanding objectives. The traditional general ventilation and boundary condition control may not fulfill the task. The designers may have to turn to personal environmental control. An inverse design that can take into account each individual's demanding objectives and its combination with a personal environmental control is a good topic for future study. The inverse design can demonstrate evidently its advantage in such a case.",
