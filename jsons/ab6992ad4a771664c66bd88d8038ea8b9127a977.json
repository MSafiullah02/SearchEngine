For example, during the month of January 2020, only 1700 specimens were tested (media report by the hospital on WeChat, 1/29/2020), compared with the vast number of clinic patients during that period (between 22 January and 30 January alone, there were over 7000 visits to one of the designated fever clinic).

Other common respiratory etiologies, such as influenza, were excluded. These remain \"suspected\" cases and may be reflective of false negativity in sampling. In some patients, the virus may be present in the lower respiratory secretion but absent in the upper respiratory tracts.With the current tests, it is therefore difficult to achieve a meaningful assessment of what proportion of symptomatic patients are infected.3 | SEROLOGICAL ASSAYS ARE NEEDEDData from the SARS epidemic show that serological responses, including viral-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG, can allow for serologic diagnosis.8,9 Most recently, it was shown that patients with 2019-nCov pneumonia also possessed similar acute serological responses.4 Using the bat SARSr-111 CoV Rp3 nucleocapsid protein (NP) as an antigen, both IgG and IgM antibodies could be detected with enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) in these patients. The dynamic pattern is consistent with an acute viral infection, with the IgG concentration beginning to rise as IgM levels start to drop.4 As we know, the production of host antibodies to a specific virus during an acute phase infection is consistent in most patients, except for those with immunodeficiency. The IgM antibody can be detected as early as day 3 in many infections. The requirement for specimen quality is less stringent than for RNA-based assays. Whether viruses themselves are present in respiratory specimens, the presence of a specific antibody can be uniformly detected, avoiding false-negativeresults due to sampling. Most importantly, with the regular 96-well microplate, and automatic ELISA devices, the test capacity is greatly increased compared to RNA-based molecular tests and can handle a large number of febrile patients such as in the current epidemic, with a quick turnaround time (2-3 hours). For example, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by hantavirus was endemic in Hubei Province, with a high annual incidence in the 1980s and 1990s. The rapid and specific etiologic diagnosis was critical for patient management and epidemic controls. An IgM-capture ELISA was used to quickly screen all febrile patients effectively during those epidemic seasons. 10,11 Similarly, for the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCVP) situation, an IgM-capture ELISA can offer earlier and more efficient confirmation or exclusion of the nCoV-2019 infection in patients with fever, thus adding to the accuracy of epidemiologic monitoring and facilitating proper isolation of patients. From a technical point of view, although the NP can serve as a sensitive antigen, other 2019-nCoV-specific epitopes or antigens should be explored for use in the serology assay. It has been reported that the N protein of SARS CoV antigenically cross-reacted with antisera of antigenic group-I animal coronaviruses such as human coronavirus 229E, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC404591/). Therefore, the use of the whole N protein as the antigen for serological assay could lead to specificity and sensitivity issues potentially. During this current outbreak, one of the authors volunteered in one of the designated fever clinics. The scene was astonishing, with over a thousand of anxious patients with illnesses ranging from mild to severe, all lined up and waiting over 4 hours to be seen. The vast majority could be individuals without infection by nCoV-2019, yet all the protection they had was facial masks. One cannot imagine how much risk for cross infection can occur in such over-crowded situations. If some rapid viral diagnostic tests were available, the situation would be completely different.

After the city-wide shutdown and heightened public warning, there was a surge of clinic patients. Many patients would visit several clinics or the same clinic daily, trying to be selected for RNA tests. A significant number of them had symptoms or lab findings that are not consistent with NCVP, such as elevated lymphocytes and lack of chest CT findings. With a serological test, these patients could avoid the clinic visits.Currently, RNA-based molecular tests require upscale lab facilities with restrictive biosafety levels and technical sophistication, and expensive. The screening patient population is in both large medical centers or smaller community-level hospitals. Serologic tests can be easily implemented in the clinical laboratory of any hospital, thus with a much wider application than molecular tests. Another issue for consideration is reporting of asymptomatically infected cases, or very mild cases of infection who are a large group of patients but not tested for viral RNA (which is impractical), therefore making the true rate of infection in the population unknown. With the development of a specific IgG antibody test, a large-scale sero-epidemiological study can be conducted after the end of the current outbreak, so that we can understand the true scale of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus of 2019.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "The authors declare that there are no conflict of interests.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CONFLICT OF INTERESTS"}]}
