            "text": "Gut microbiota is often called the \u201cforgotten organ\u201d in its symbiotic host (O\u2019Hara & Shanahan, 2006) and plays essential roles in food digestion, energy harvest, metabolism, and immune training of its host (Donaldson, Lee, & Mazmanian, 2016; Hooper, Littman, & Macpherson, 2012; Hooper, Midtvedt, & Gordon, 2002; Qin et al., 2010; Turnbaugh et al., 2006; Velagapudi et al., 2010). In mammals, large\u2010scale studies of gut microbiota have been conducted in humans (Huttenhower et al., 2012; Lozupone, Stombaugh, Gordon, Jansson, & Knight, 2012; Saraswati & Sitaraman, 2015; Yatsunenko et al., 2012), mice (Gu et al., 2013; Tanca et al., 2017), other domestic animals such as pigs (Mu, Yang, Su, Zoetendal, & Zhu, 2017) and sheep (Zeng et al., 2017), and to a lesser extent in wild animals, such as bats (Chiroptera). Bats have been largely overlooked in terms of their gut microbiota although they represent the second largest mammalian order and over 20% of mammal species (Simmons, 2005). To date, only eight research papers on the gut microbiota of bats have been published (Banskar, Mourya, & Shouche, 2016; Carrillo\u2010Araujo et al., 2015; Daniel et al., 2013; Dietrich, Kearney, Seamark, & Markotter, 2017; Galicia, Buenrostro, & Garc\u00eda, 2014; Malini\u010dov\u00e1, Hrehov\u00e1, Maxinov\u00e1, Uhrin, & Prista\u0161, 2017; Phillips et al., 2012; Weinberg et al., 2017). Comparing with a significant number of studies on viruses in bats (Annan et al., 2013; Calisher, Childs, Field, Holmes, & Schountz, 2006; Tong et al., 2013; Yuan et al., 2010), more work is needed to investigate gut bacterial microbiotas and their effects on ecology and evolution of bats.",

However, recent studies have shown that microbiota community compositions varied between different gut regions and feces of mice, (Gu et al., 2013; Looft et al., 2014; Mu et al., 2017) and pikas (Li, Chen, et al., 2017) possibly because microbiotas play different functional roles in different intestinal compartments and niches. To date, very few such comparisons have been conducted in wild animals (but see Kohl et al., 2017; Li, Li, et al., 2017) to test whether fecal samples can be used as a proxy of the microbiota in other gut regions.",

For this aim, we sampled two bat species, Rhinolophus sinicus (Rhinolophidae, Yinpterochiroptera) and Myotis altarium (Vespertilionidae, Yangochiroptera). Both species live in the same cave. Both of them are insectivorous and feed on insects such as Coleoptera (Hu, Yang, Tan, & Zhang, 2012; Zhang, 1985). Here by focusing on these two bat species, we aim to (a) characterize their core microbiota and compare it to that of other bat species and mammals; (b) compare the microbiota of paired small intestine, large intestine and feces to test whether fecal samples can be used as a proxy of the microbiota in other gut regions.",

Bat sampling procedure was approved by the National Animal Research Authority, East China Normal University (approval ID 20080209). In order to reduce the possibility of contamination, each bat was kept in a single clean and sterile bag. Feces samples were collected in about two hours after bat capturing and transferred to RNase\u2010free PCR tubes. Then, bats were rapidly euthanized by cervical dislocation to minimize pain and intestinal tissues were taken and transferred to RNase\u2010free PCR tubes. In this study, intestinal tissues were divided into small intestine (defined as the region close to section of the back stomach, the part of the duodenum) and large intestine (defined as the part of colon, far from the rectum). All samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen in the field and then stored at a \u221280\u00b0C freezer after going back to the laboratory. To harvest the gut microbiota, the intestinal regions were opened and washed at least three times with the physiological saline DEPC (Diethy pyrocarbonate). Here, intestinal samples include collections of luminal contents. Together with fecal samples, a total of 18 samples were generated in the current study (Table 1).",

Because several genetic lineages have been found for R. sinicus in the mainland of China (Mao et al., 2013), we identified the specific lineage for bats used in this study by reconstructing a Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree based on cytb sequences of the focal three samples and ones from the previous study. ML tree was reconstructed in the software RAxML 7.2.8 (Berger, Krompass, & Stamatakis, 2011) with GTRGAMMA model and bootstrap supports were estimated from 1,000 replicate searches.",

In addition, pairwise comparisons of the three sampling sources were also significant (p < 0.05 in all Welch\u2019s t test) (Figure 3b). However, at 7,010 sequences depth the difference of alpha diversity among the three sampling sources was not significant (p = 0.411) (Supporting Information Figure S3) and also for the three pairwise comparisons (p > 0.05 in all Welch\u2019s t test). These results indicated that sequences depth generated for each sample might affect alpha diversity measurements. Although we did not recover any OTUs whose abundance differed significantly among the three sampling sources (one\u2010way ANOVA test, p > 0.05), we did find some taxa with a relative high abundance in specific sampling sources. Specifically, among genera with the top 15 abundance small intestine has more Vibrio; large intestine has more Serratia, Prevotella 9, and Bacteroides; the feces have more Hafnia and Clostridium (Figure 3c). This abundance difference among different sampling sources was largely due to a specific sample and not consistent across all three samples, as revealed by the heatmap (Figure 3d). For example, more Serratia, Prevotella 9, and Bacteroides in large intestine resulted from an extremely high abundance of each genus in RL\u20103, RL\u20102 and RL\u20101, respectively. Similar findings were observed in the high abundance of Hafnia and Clostridium in feces. However, a high abundance of Vibrio observed in small intestine did occur in all three samples. In addition, Vibrio was the only genus showing a significant abundance difference among pairwise comparisons (i.e. the small intestine vs. large intestine, p = 0.0316, Welch\u2019s t test). Overall, heatmap plots of the top 15 abundance genera revealed that samples were mixed and did not cluster based on their corresponding sampling sources (Figure 3d).",

In Carrillo\u2010Araujo et al. (2015), the intestine was divided into three fractions of similar size (anterior, medium, and posterior). In addition, fecal samples were not included in Carrillo\u2010Araujo et al. (2015).

Indeed, as for the microbiota difference between large and small intestine, our results in M. altarium were consistent with Carrillo\u2010Araujo et al. (2015). In addition, sequences depth per sample may also contribute to the contrast between our study and Carrillo\u2010Araujo et al. (2015).

In the future, more number of individuals will be needed to test this suggestion. Recent studies have shown that the sex of hosts may affect the gut microbial diversity (e.g. Fierer, Hamady, Lauber, & Knight, 2008; Markle et al., 2013). In this study, all R. sinicus individuals are male and all M. altarium are females. Thus, we did not compare the difference of microbial diversity between these two bat species.
