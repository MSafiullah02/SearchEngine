Social media platforms have been explored as a research recruitment tool in other settings; however, their feasibility for collecting representative survey data during infectious disease epidemics remain unexplored. Objectives: This study has two aims 1) describe the methodology used to recruit a nationwide sample of adults residing in the United States (U.S.) to participate in a survey on COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, and practices, and 2) outline the preliminary findings related to recruitment, challenges using social media as a recruitment platform, and strategies used to address these challenges. Methods: An original web-based survey informed by evidence from past literature and validated scales was developed. A Facebook advertisement campaign was used to disseminate the link to an online Qualtrics survey between March 20-30, 2020. Two supplementary male-only and racial minority-targeted advertisements were created on the sixth and tenth day of recruitment, respectively, to address issues of disproportionate female-and White-oriented gender-and ethnic-skewing observed in the advertisement's reach and response trends. Results: In total, 6602 participant responses were recorded with representation from all U.S. 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The advertisements cumulatively reached 236,017 individuals and resulted in 9609 clicks (4.07% reach). Total cost of the advertisement was $906, resulting in costs of $0.09 per click and $0.18 per full response (completed surveys). Implementation of the male-only advertisement improved the cumulative percentage of male respondents from approximately 20 to 40%.",

Along with pressing requirements for surveillance data on COVID-19 incidence, morbidity, and mortality, it is essential to effectively and efficiently collect data to gauge population-level experiences related to COVID-19. Specifically, given that much of the prevention and societal impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are driven by behavioral decisions, such as hygiene practices and social distancing [1] , collecting insights on knowledge, beliefs, and practices related to COVID-19 can be valuable in informing public health professionals and policy makers developing targeted interventions and effective behavior change communication campaigns.",

According to the Pew Research Center, in 2019, Facebook was the second most popular social media platform, used by 69% of U.S. adults [9] . In addition to its popularity, an advantage of Facebook over other online platforms is that 74% of adult users access it on a daily basis, and it is the social platform most frequently accessed by all age groups, including older adults [10] .",

Within each platform, examples of where advertisements could be placed included in individual newsfeed, as a \"story\" (a visual newsfeed), and in-stream (within videos on the platform). The Facebook Audience Network is a group of Facebook-approved mobile apps and websites which allow Facebook advertisements to be shown. According to Facebook, inclusion of the Audience Network in a Facebook advertising campaign can increase success rates of an advertisement by a factor of 8 [25] . Although advertisement placement is driven by factors such as advertisement type, content, and design, the delivery system primarily aims to maximize the number of optimization events (e.g., clicks on an advertisement link) to achieve the lowest average cost per optimization event (e.g., cost per link click) across the various platforms.",

An initial daily budget of $20 was set for the first day of advertising. The amount was manually adjusted throughout the recruitment period based on monitoring of the response rate. The daily budget reflected an approximate amount Facebook would spend on distributing the advertisement each day. If the delivery algorithm detected an opportunity to acquire more results on a particular day it could spend up to 25% above the daily budget [26] . However, it would approximately maintain the stipulated total budget across multiple days. Although the delivery strategy was focused on link clicks, the costs of advertisement delivery were based on impressions, incurring a cost each time the advertisement was shown. Payment based on link clicks was only available for advertisement accounts with several weeks of history consistently following Facebook policies, and this option was therefore unavailable for this study.",

This drop in male reach was likely a reflection of the smaller male response rate (number of clicks over number reached), resulting in a greater cost per click for men, which may have triggered the Facebook algorithm to target more women to increase the efficiency of advertisement delivery. Although the significance of this gender bias and the need for interventions had not been pre-planned, to address this issue, a supplemental advertisement (Ad2) was created near the end of the sixth day with the same settings as the original (Ad1) with the exception that it only targeted men. The male-only setting of Ad2 came into full effect on the seventh day after it was initially approved with the exact same gender settings as Ad1. The daily budget for Ad1 was then decreased while the budget for Ad2 (male targeted ad) was increased for about 4 days of recruitment. Through this adjustment, the cumulative percent of male respondents markedly increased from 20 to 40% by the end of the survey. The creation of a supplemental advertisement (as opposed to adjusting the settings of the initial advertisement to male-only) was to ensure that women and those with non-binary sexes were still able to be recruited throughout the entirety of the campaign, albeit in smaller numbers.",

Indeed, there were obvious limitations in this method's ability to ensure sample representativeness across all sociodemographic variables, monitoring recruitment of ethnic/racial groups and men, in this case, and over-sampling of participants with specific sociodemographic characteristics through implementation of compensatory advertisements may, at least partly, circumvent some of these limitations.",

The gender composition of the sample was comparable to the US population (56.2% female in the study compared to 51.0% across the nation) [27] , although this was attributable to the supplementary male-only advertising implemented during recruitment. However, the composition of Non-Hispanic whites in the study was significantly higher than in the U.S. (92.3% compared to 60.5%) [31] . The overrepresentation of white respondents in social media-based research studies has been well documented and represents a significant limitation of the platform [4, 5] . Educational attainment, likewise, displayed mixed representativeness; those with some college attainment were overrepresented (34.2% compared to 18.0%), although this may be in part because the U.S. Census defined the category as \"some college, no degree\" while the \"no degree\" component was not defined in the current study [29] . Representativeness of employment distribution was difficult to assess due to differences in terminologies used in the study with the U.S. Census categories. These limitations are in part due to the fact that the questionnaire items for the demographic characteristics were informed by past surveys rather than directly from the U.S. Census categories. In addition, the fact that the recruitment period corresponded with a time of dramatic increase in unemployment [32] may have impacted the data distribution. ",

We intend to conduct additional waves of data collection using a similar survey methodology to track temporal changes in public perceptions and behaviors as the COVID pandemic progresses. Lessons learned from the acknowledgement of these limitations will serve to improve future surveys by us as well as other investigators. First, the over-representation of Non-Hispanic white women and the corresponding under-representation of men and ethnic/racial minorities, compromised the representativeness of the sample and, consequently, the extent to which findings may be extrapolated to the general U.S. population. A recent in-depth analysis of the Facebook advertisement delivery optimization algorithm suggests that the platform uses complex automated advertisement content analyses to steer advertisements towards certain subsets of its users (e.g., men or women) [33] . Such insights suggest that the content or preliminary data from the COVID-19 survey advertisement may have been interpreted by the underlying algorithm to display the advertisement to more women. Nonetheless, the attempt to ameliorate this skewing by creating a supplementary male-only advertisement was effective in enhancing total and percent male reach and responses, suggesting that any unforeseen skewing incurred from the Facebook advertisement delivery algorithm can be addressed by such measures. Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding.

Ad1 was temporarily disabled on the fifth day of recruitment citing article 27 of the Facebook Advertising Policies on Unacceptable Business Practices; however, following an appeal the advertisement was quickly re-enabled and actively recruited participants until the end of the study period. However, during the eleventh and final day of recruitment Ad2 was similarly disabled for the same reason, although upon similar appeal, it was not re-enabled (despite having identical content to the re-enabled Ad1). Although few past studies using Facebook or other social media platforms have explicitly documented issues of disabled advertisements or advertisements failing to pass through review [5] , specifics of advertisement imagery have been cited as barriers in the Facebook review process [34] . However, this obstacle may also be explained by an announcement posted by Facebook during the recruitment period that, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Facebook and the need to relocate contract workers in charge of content and advertisement review, it would be reducing the number of appeals getting reviewed (as well as longer response times for ongoing appeals) [35] . Such a barrier may also be significant for future studies attempting to use Facebook-based recruitment for COVID-19 research specifically, as well as other research in times of large scale and disruptive health crises.",

Indeed, while a similar number of participants were recruited to the study in a shorter time period, participants were paid $1.50 for completing the questionnaire [2] (8.3 times higher than the $0.18 average cost per full response in the current study), suggesting a strength of social-media based recruitment in minimizing cost per response in the context of COVID-19 and potentially in-progress health crises in general.",

The survey similarly utilized social media platforms (notably WeChat and Weibo) to recruit participants between January 27 and February 1, 2020 (approximately 6 days) [3] . However, the study authors largely relied upon personal networks of people living in Hubei province, and also posted the advertisement to a select number of institutional WeChat accounts and local popular media outlets, which may have resulted in the fact that 55.1% of participants resided in Hubei province alone [3] . Indeed, the relatively diverse and well-distributed geographic distribution across the sample was facilitated by using advertisements on social media in the current study and suggest another key strength of this specific use of the platform to obtain national samples on COVID-19 or potentially other rapidly evolving health crises. A further strength this social media advertisement campaign was observed to provide was the ability to effectively monitor and intervene on observed gender biases to enhance the representative of the study sample.",

Aside from the aforementioned similarities in experiencing over-representation of white and female populations, the over-representation of individuals with higher education is also a salient issue [4] . Likewise, the 4.1% conversation rate (which was link clicks per individuals reached in this context) matched the 4% average observed in past studies [4] . However, the recruitment period of 11 days was significantly shorter than 5.13-month average in Facebook-based health research. Moreover, the average cost per click ($0.09) and cost per eligible participant ($0.14) was markedly lower than the health research average of $0.57 and $19.71 [4] . The greater cost-effectiveness of utilizing Facebook for COVID-19 research may be reflection of conducting a recruitment campaign during a period of great public interest on the topic, highlighting that collecting large quantities of survey data during ongoing global health crises may be particularly suited for social media-based campaigns.",

Although among survey respondents the proportion of males who completed the survey was lower than the proportion among those who did not, the interventions conducted during the recruitment period were able to successfully increase the overall number of male responses, and this was able to significantly enhance the representative of the sample in comparison to U.S. Census statistics. Researchers should acknowledge any obstacles placed by advertisement delivery optimization algorithms or the realities of advertisement review challenges during times of global health crises. Although the current study was unable to obtain substantive data on the effectiveness of \"multicultural affinity\" targeting to enhance sampling of racial or ethnic minority population, future research on COVID-19 or other global health crises using social media campaigns should also evaluate such measures. However, creating supplementary gender-based targeting has the potential to appropriately enhance response rates if certain gender-based groups (such as men) are being progressively under-sampled by advertisement campaigns. Notwithstanding the aforementioned challenges and caveats, in a rapidly emerging health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, a social media campaign has the capacity to capture much needed empirical data that may be valuable for the planning, development, and implementation of health communication campaigns to mitigate health threats.",
