Most patients encouraged this model to not have to come back to an appointment and this took significant pressure off our clinics. In the event we needed to see a patient, they were informed via a telephonic conversation to attend a particular clinic appointment. From an administration standpoint, this resulted in less unnecessary follow up appointments in our skin cancer follow up clinics, which could then be offered to our regular skin cancer follow up patients as per the recommended guidelines, without having to struggle with appointments.",
