One of the key immune cells indispensable in this regard is the macrophages. In addition to phagocytic activities of macrophages against various microbes and harmful substances, they also act as antigen presenting cells and a source of cytokines and chemokines facilitating the induction of antigen specific adaptive immune responses (Arango Duque and Descoteaux, 2014). In avian species, mobilization of macrophages into the site of infection contribute more than resident macrophages in phagocytic activity (Maina, 2002).",

Once phagocytosed by macrophages, clodronate liposomes get accumulated in the cytosol, resulting in apoptosis and depletion of macrophages (van Rooijen et al., 1996). It has been shown that the use of clodronate liposomes significantly depletes macrophages in chickens (Jeurissen et al., 1998). The effect of depletion of macrophages using clodronate liposomes has been studied against various virus infections in mouse models, such as measles (Roscic-Mrkic et al., 2001) and influenza (Tate et al., 2010). In chickens, increased Marek\u2019s disease virus genome load in the blood and spleen following treatment with clodronate liposomes has been shown (Rivas et al., 2003). However, macrophage depletion using clodronate liposomes has not been extensively studied during other viral infections in chickens.",

However, studies that investigated macrophage response in chickens following avian influenza virus infection are scarce (Cornelissen et al., 2013; Rebel et al., 2011). Avian macrophages have been shown to be targeted for viral replication during infectious bronchitis corona virus (Amarasinghe et al., 2017), Marek\u2019s disease virus (Barrow et al., 2003; Chakraborty et al., 2017), avian influenza virus (Barjesteh et al., 2014), infectious laryngotrcaheitis virus (Calnek et al., 1986) and reovirus (Swanson et al., 2001) infections. Avian macrophages are also have been shown to elicit antiviral response depending on nitric oxide (NO) production against avian influenza virus (Abdul-Cader et al., 2017), infectious laryngotracheitis virus (Haddadi et al., 2013) and Marek\u2019s disease virus (Xing and Schat, 2000). Following avian influenza virus infection, macrophages secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, facilitating the development of immune response, which further reduce the replication and spread of avian influenza virus in the host (Herold et al., 2006; Peschke et al., 1993; Seo et al., 2004).",

Similarly, it has been shown that avian influenza virus infection also recruit KUL01+ cells in chickens (Cornelissen et al., 2013; Rebel et al., 2011). The recruitment of KUL01 + cells following viral infections may potentially be due to the availability of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of H4N6 LPAIV during the infection, increasing the recruitment of these cells. It has been previously shown that toll-like receptor (TLR)7 of the innate immune system recognizes PAMPs of influenza virus and activate mouse mononuclear cells (Lund et al., 2004). Furthermore, Lee et al. have shown that activation of TLR7 induces differentiation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells into one of the KUL01+ cells, macrophages (Lee et al., 2014).",

            "text": "KUL01+ cells including macrophages are important immune cells that can be beneficial in innate antiviral response against H4N6 LPAIV infection via several mechanisms. First, it is known that macrophages can lead to the production of a number of antiviral cytokines including IFN\u03b3 (Barjesteh et al., 2014; Dimier et al., 1998), IL-1\u03b2 (Lavric et al., 2007) and release of reactive nitrogen species such as NO (Setta et al., 2012). Previously, it has been shown that NO originated from avian macrophages are inhibiting infectious laryngotracheitis virus (Haddadi et al., 2013), reo virus (Pertile et al., 1996) and Marek\u2019s disease virus (Xing and Schat, 2000) infections in vitro. We have previously observed that inhibition of H4N6 LPAIV replication is attributable to NO produced from KUL01+ cells (Abdul-Cader et al., 2017). Second, tracheal macrophages can play a role in clearing H4N6 LPAIV infected cells as has been shown in mouse model of influenza infection (Hashimoto et al., 2007). However, the lack of significant differences in H4N6 LPAIV genome loads between clodronate liposome treated and controls could be two-fold. First, immune cell functions are redundant (Hamada et al., 2013) and it is possible that even the KUL01 + cell staining was decreased following clodronate liposome treatment, the functions of these cells may have been compensated by other intact immune cells in chicken. Second, it is possible that the number of animals used per group (n = 4) may not have provided adequate power in our experiments to show differences in H4N6 LPAIV genome loads in all the examined tissues in chickens although number of animals used are adequate for differentiating of KUL01+ cells in trachea and duodenum.",

            "text": "Although our investigations led to generation of significant new knowledge, there were some limitations. First, the monoclonal antibody used for the quantification of macrophages detects KUL01 mannose receptor and these receptors are also expressed by monocytes and dendritic cells of chicken (Mast et al., 1998) as such it is possible that the quantified macrophages may also include monocytes and dendritic cells. However, only macrophages and their precursor, blood monocyte will uptake the liposomes; since it has been shown that liposomes of the size >200 nm will not be internalized by non-phagocytic cells and other immune cells such as granulocytes (Claassen et al., 1990). Dendritic cells are also unaffected upon administration of clodronate encapsulated-liposomes (van Rooijen and Hendrikx, 2010). However, we believe that KUL01 cell staining alone is not adequate for characterizing cells reduced by clodronate liposomes and further immune markers should have been included in the experiments. Second, we did not observe that intra-abdominal clodronate liposome treatment completely decrease the staining intensity of KUL01+ cells. Third, in our experiments we used a LPAIV strain H4N6 which does not lead to clinical signs due to the fact that it establishes low grade infection. Consequently, we resorted to real-time PCR technique to quantify this low grade H4N6 LPAIV infection in the observed tissues, which is more sensitive than the immunofluorescent assay (Landry et al., 2008; Perosa et al., 2013), although immunofluorescent assay would have given more meaningful data relevant to H4N6 LPAIV infection in the observed respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues.",
