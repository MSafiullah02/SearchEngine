Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Influenza viruses and Rhinoviruses are the most common etiological viral agents. A novel human Coronavirus (HCoV) was this year identified as causative agent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV) [1]. Two others HCoV have been known for 30 years (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) [2] and only recently has HCoV-229E been recognized as an important cause of NRVI in high-risk infants [3], [4]. We reported previously a high incidence of HCoV among NRVI in hospitalized preterm neonates concomitant with HCoV isolation from staff members of a Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit [5].",

Since monoclonal antibodies are not available for routine immunofluorescence (IF) detection, and clinical strains of both antigenic groups of HCoV are not well adapted to conventional cell culture systems, their diagnosis is not routinely performed. A reliable diagnostic tool is needed to study their epidemiology in hospital care units. An appropriate tool for HCoV diagnosis has to be sensitive and suitable for large scale testing in respiratory specimens. The feasibility of reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and its higher sensitivity compared to IF for detection of HCoV were previously demonstrated [7]. Several other amplification strategies have already been reported [8], [9]. In this study, we used a previously described HCoV-229E RT-PCR methodology [7] followed by hybridization detection to screen directly near 2000 nasal samples from hospitalized children and staff members, without previous cell passage. We evaluated the reliability of this technique in a large prospective study.",

Cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO2 in Earle's minimal essential medium: Hank's M199 (1/1, v/v) (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France), supplemented with 0.13% (w/v) sodium bicarbonate, 20 \u03bcg/ml gentamicin (Panpharma, Foug\u00e8res, France), 100,000 U/l penicillin (Eurobio), 0.1 g/l streptomycin (Eurobio) and fetal bovine serum (5% (v/v)) (Gibco, Cergy Pontoise, France). The fourth passage of HCoV-229E in the susceptible L132 cell line, yielded a viral suspension with a titer of 3.16\u00d7105 50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose per ml (TCID50/ml). It was kept at \u221280 \u00b0C and used for RT-PCR experiments. The infectious virus titer of the HCoV-229E reference strain used for evaluation of RT-PCR methods was measured by an indirect IF test with a monoclonal antibody (mouse IgG1 mAb, 5-11H.6, obtained from Professor Talbot, Quebec, Canada), as described previously [7].",

HCoV single-stranded DNA hybridized with the 5\u2032 biotinylated E8 probe GGAAGTGCAGGTGTTGTGGC which targets the nucleocapsid gene in 969\u2013988 [11]. E8 was previously coated on streptavidin-coated wells of a microtiter plate. Then, an anti-double stranded DNA mouse monoclonal antibody was used to detect the hybrid, if present. This specific hybridization was revealed with an enzyme tracer (protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase). We determined the optimal probe concentration for coating: 0.5 ng/\u03bcl. The test was carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 20 \u03bcl of the RT-PCR product was added to the streptavidin-coated microplate wells in 100 \u03bcl of binding buffer. After one hour at 50 \u00b0C followed by three washing steps with the kit's washing buffer, 100 \u03bcl of anti-double stranded DNA diluted 1/50 was added to each well. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and washed, then 100 \u03bcl of 1/50 diluted enzyme tracer was added and the microplate incubated for a further 30 min at room temperature, then washed. The reaction was developed by addition of 100 \u03bcl of substrate. Absorbance was read at 450/630 nm in a photometer. A cut-off value of positivity, expressed in optical density (OD), was defined as the mean of the OD for negative controls plus the constant value of 0.150 absorbance units, as given in the kit recommendations (a positive sample showed an OD value more than 0.150 above the mean of the negative controls).",

Nine samples were positive for two viruses (four HCoV\u2013RSV, three HCoV\u2013Influenza A, two Influenza A\u2013Adenovirus,). General incidence of NRVI was 17.2% (110 infants) with 106 HCoV and five parainfluenza type 3 (one neonate presented two nosocomial infections with HCoV and P3). Seventy samples were positive in staff involving 69 HCoV and one Influenza A.",

Most epidemiological studies conducted mainly in the 1970s used serological assays to detect a Coronavirus infection [12]. However, these techniques are not suitable for the diagnostic of respiratory infections because of poor sensitivity and the requirement for two successive blood samples. Cell cultures have proved to be unreliable for the primary isolation of all human respiratory Coronaviruses. Indeed, only some HCoV strains grow in cell culture after adaptation [6]. Diagnosis of respiratory viral infections is mainly based on IF. For diagnosis of HCoV infection, one anti-229E specific monoclonal antibody (Argene, Varilhes, France) was available but is no longer commercialized. One of us (P.J. Talbot, INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier research center) developed two other monoclonal antibodies (5-11H.6 for HCoV-229E and 1-10C.1 for HCoV-OC43) directed against the S protein [7]. For diagnosis procedure, the IF assay using these antibodies appears to be less sensitive than the RT-PCR-DEIA we describe in the current study [7].",

            "text": "To test for HCoV-229E in the course of large scale epidemiological studies, we used a RT-PCR hybridization method for rapid, specific, and more sensitive detection of HCoV-229E DNA products. Hybridization is more specific and sensitive than agarose gel visualization [13]. The microplate enzyme immunoassay format allows the handling of large number of samples needed for epidemiological studies. Another advantage of RT-PCR methodology is that it can detect the virus genome when it is present at a low titer or when the virus is not replication competent. The value of RT-PCR techniques for certain important respiratory viruses, namely Human Rhino-, and Coronaviruses, is clear because no other practical and rapid techniques are available [14], [15]. Several recent studies have used molecular techniques such as RT-PCR followed by a hybridization step for viral diagnosis [16], [17]. Here, we have adapted and validated such a methodology for a large scale epidemiological study. This requires processing numerous samples while minimizing the time and labor associated with the original molecular HCoV-specific detection protocols. The time needed for diagnosis of HCoV-229E by the RT-PCR-DEIA methodology, which can be carried out in microplates that enable rapid multichannel pipetting, is shorter than that required for cell culture associated with IF detection (4\u20135 days) but longer than for IF performed directly on nasal aspirates. However, these techniques are not as sensitive as RT-PCR [7]. Eighty-five clinical samples can be tested in parallel within 10 h for the RT-PCR-DEIA described in the current study, which makes it a reliable screening technique suitable for epidemiological studies. HCoV-229E was detected by this RT-PCR-DEIA with a sensitivity of 0.5TCID50/ml. This limit of detection compares well with the values previously obtained by others [9], [16], [17] (20, 0.05 and 0.3TCID50/ml, respectively). Moreover, such a threshold represents an acceptable titer for the detection of viruses implicated in clinical events.",
