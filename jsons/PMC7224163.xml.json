ADAM-17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17), during physiological conditions and in SARS-CoV infection, can cleave mACE2, resulting in shedding and soluble ACE2 (sACE2) [2, 3], a process also associated with ALI (acute lung injury) [1]. High mACE2 and/or high ADAM-17 activity may therefore facilitate SARS CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19, and sACE2 may capture this risk, reflecting (i) high mACE2, (ii) high ADAM-17 activity, or (iii) both.",

Data is presented as Normalized Protein eXpression (NPX) values, which is an arbitrary unit on a log2 scale (Olink Proteomics AB, Uppsala, Sweden; http://www.olink.com). Seven outlier observations of sACE2 that deviated more than 3 SD from the gender-specific mean were removed from the analyses. Characteristics of subjects included in the analyses of the present study are presented in Table 1. Differences in sACE2 between male and female subjects were calculated using analysis of covariance, adjusted for age.

Animal and in vitro studies on SARS-CoV point to the importance of mACE2, and ADAM-17-mediated mACE2 shedding, for the development of severe ALI [1, 2]. For example, overexpression of human ACE2 increases disease severity in SARS-CoV-infected mice [1]. Also, ADAM-17 silencing decreases host cell entry of SARS-CoV [2]. The spike protein of the coronavirus HNL63CoV, which results only in common cold, does not induce mACE2 shedding [2]. High mACE2 and/or high ADAM-17 activity may therefore be risk factors for severe COVID-19 [1, 2]. Since high sACE2 could indicate high mACE2 and/or high ADAM-17 activity, sACE2 may be a marker of both susceptibility and severity of COVID-19.",
