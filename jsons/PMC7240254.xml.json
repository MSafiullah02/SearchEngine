Therefore, the means of the counts (Table 1 column 4) are influenced by the skewness of the data and may differ among hospitals based on how many samples are done for each pair of cases. In other words, the recommended sample size based on the means may not be generalizable among hospitals.",

If P <\u03b1 for the one-sided alternative that the incidence of transmission is greater than threshold, more sampling commences. During the weeks spent preparing to implement additional measures to prevent transmission and infections, sampling continues if, as shown below, more samples are needed at baseline to evaluate reductions over time. After intervention starts, sampling is done for a similar number of pairs of cases to estimate the achieved lower incidence of S. aureus transmission. The null hypothesis tested by comparing the two independent binomial proportions would be no difference in the proportions of pairs of cases with transmission. The alternative hypothesis would be one-sided, a reduction in incidence. (Use of infection control bundles may be ineffective, but they do not result in greater transmission.)",

Boschloo's test has greater statistical power than Fisher's exact test under all combinations of \u03b1, total sample size, and distribution of cases between groups.39 For example, whereas Boschloo's test would require N =29 per group (above), the sample size for Fisher's exact test would be 34 per group (StatXact-12.0). Fisher's exact test is not always available as a one-sided test, and, if so, the sample size would be 41 per group. Importantly, just like Fisher's exact test, Boschloo's test does not have Type I error rates exceeding nominal levels under our conditions.39 For example, for two-sided tests with \u03b1 =.05, and N =50 in each of the two groups, and proportions of 10.0% or 25.0% in each of the two groups, for 3.2% or 4.1% of simulations the null hypothesis was rejected, neither exceeding the nominal incidence of 5.0%.39 Therefore, the use of Boschloo's test for surveillance of S. aureus transmission is reasonable.",

For example, at the University of Iowa, currently during the COVID-19 pandemic, process measures are being reported daily, including use of patient decolonization (viral antisepsis) and patient initial phase I post-anesthesia care unit recovery and multimodal cleaning after each higher risk procedure or when the procedure is sufficiently urgent that it was started before the results of testing for SARS-CoV-2 were complete.1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n12\n,\n13\n,\n24 We provide an example of defining the population for sampling by using patient outcomes (i.e., infection) data from 4 studies of closed lumen intravenous systems and hand decontamination.41\n,\n42\n,\n43\n,\n44 (These were deidentified data that we had available, and quickly given that the current study was performed acutely when the COVID-19 pandemic spread to the USA). The overall incidence of hospital acquired infection was 7.5%, 294 infections among the 3936 cases (i.e., rows in the uploaded file). Associations known from previous studies supported validity to this use of the data. Specifically, increases in anesthesia duration were associated with greater incidence of infection (P <.0001 by Kendall's \u03c4 and logistic regression).23\n,\n45\n,\n46\n,\n47 In addition, by Kruskal-Wallis tests, the incidence differed among the 11 specialties (P =.0001)23\n,\n45\n,\n46\n,\n47 and among the 86 different operating rooms (P =.0001)23. For example, the incidences of infection were 15.5% for urology and 11.5% for gynecology versus 4.7% for otolaryngology and 5.0% for orthopedic surgery. Among the 24 of 86 rooms each with at least 1.0% of cases, the two largest incidences of infection were 14.1% and 14.0%, and the lowest observed incidences were 3.1% and 3.2%.",

As listed pointwise in Table 4, first, sampling would be done from one or a few different combinations of specialty and room. Second, plan to monitor the incidence of S. aureus transmission within and between successive cases. Perform 2 tests in fixed sequence. Sample from 25 pairs of cases (from the randomized trial [Section 7], 15 based on the observational data [Section 6]). Use the binomial test to evaluate if significantly high incidence of transmission. Third, if so, continue surveillance while initiating interventions, obtaining an extra 25 (or 14) pairs of cases. Evaluate effectiveness of modified patient decolonization (viral antiseptic),2 hand hygiene, use of closed lumen intravenous systems and hub disinfection, and environmental cleaning using 50 (or 29) pairs of cases, applying Boschloo's exact test. The larger sample sizes (i.e., the total of 50 pairs of cases) are those obtained based on the recently completed randomized trial showing reduced S. aureus transmission and surgical site infections.1 Fourth, follow-up monitoring can be done using Bernoulli CUSUM control charts.",

Feedback would not be by individual (e.g., surgeon), because perioperative infection bundles are multidisciplinary (e.g., include patient decolonization done before operating room entrance and environmental cleaning by housekeepers). The results of the current study show also that sample sizes would be insufficient. For example, we consider the futility of reporting the incidence of pairs of cases with transmission by surgeon (or proceduralist). Among the surgeons in the randomized trial, 0/32 had 25 pairs of cases over 6 months and only 2/32 had at least 15 pairs each 6-months.1 At the outpatient surgery center of a large teaching hospital in Pennsylvania, only 2/65 surgeons had enough workload to fill an operating room for 8 hours every week.48 At the hospital's main surgical suite, only 28% of the surgeons (59/211) had enough workload to fill 1 room every week.48 A large teaching hospital in New York had at most 1 pair of cases per month for 36/45 surgeons.49 Statewide among Iowa's 117 hospitals, 54% (SE 2%) of the surgeon-days with at least 1 outpatient case had only one case (i.e., there would be no pairs of cases to sample by surgeon).50 Statewide among Florida's 147 facilities with anesthesiologist pain medicine physicians performing spinal neuromodulation procedures, 98% (SE 1%) of the proceduralist-facility weeks had zero or one case.51 Furthermore, we do not think that feedback to individual surgeons, anesthesiologists, etc., would be necessary.

However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of Iowa initiated rapid dissemination of the multifaceted approach1 to reduce intraoperative bacterial and viral contamination, and plans to use Bernoulli CUSUM to monitor for group level feedback of sustainability.40 We needed to know appropriate sample sizes, inferential testing, and basis for selecting pairs of cases to sample. Yet, implementation of intraoperative infection control bundles and feedback are not literally two periods, as we modeled, they are a time series. The use of segmented regression in the logit scale, for the binary variable of transmission or not, seems an intuitively better choice. However, from the available data, we not only have insufficient sample size to develop such a model for statistical power analyses, we lack the necessary data explaining why specific pairs of cases were sampled at the studied hospital. Because preventing intraoperative environmental contamination from COVID-19 is essential for the acute crisis, we hope others use our results, collect more data, and can make comparisons with our uploaded data.",
