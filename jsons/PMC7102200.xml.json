Internal medicine, a science of complexity, teaches us how to handle patients affected by several comorbidities, requiring multidisciplinary expertise within a work team. As internists, we initially evaluate more prevalent etiologies, and we critically dynamically refine or revise our hypothesis; if most common causes are excluded, we evaluate the rare ones [2]. Our resident Dr. Ferrarese will now present a paradigmatic case of dyspnoea where internists, pneumologists, oncologists, radiologists and pathologists joined to reach a systematic diagnosis.",

DAD, as detected at autopsy, is a histologic finding mainly observed during hematologic malignancies, infections, connective tissue diseases, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, solid tumors (radiation or chemotherapy induced), acute interstitial pneumonia, or after solid organ transplantation [8]. About one third of patients with severe ARDS develop the histological pattern of DAD, the role of which on the outcome is still debated [9]. ARDS related mortality is significantly higher among cancer patients (55 vs 24%), infections being the commonest etiology [10]. However, in those patients who do not improve after antimicrobial therapy, other causes must be carefully investigated, just as in our patient.",

Thus, after exclusion of infection and neoplastic infiltration, and after ineffective treatment of congestive heart failure, we hypothesized ARDS due to CILD as the main diagnosis.
