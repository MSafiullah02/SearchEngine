            "text": "Long-acting injectable antipsychotics treatment during COVID-19 pandemic -A new challenge Non-adherence is an important factor in therapeutic failure, which is frequently correlated with disease progression. This phenomenon is common in most diseases that require chronic treatment (cardiovascular, metabolic, degenerative, etc.) (Timmerman et al., 2016) . In the case of mental illness and schizophrenia in particular, non-adherence (total or partial) reaches up to 75% of cases, being rather the rule than the exception (Kane et al., 2013a; Dobber et al., 2018; Kishimoto et al., 2013a) . Medication non-adherence is associated with poor outcomes, more hospital readmissions, and increased costs of care in schizophrenia (Winton-Brown et al., 2017; Haddad et al., 2014) .",
