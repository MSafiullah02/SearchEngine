For this reason, when presented to a patient with pulmonary embolism, without any evident risk factor for this pathology, the potential association between COVID-19 and pulmonary embolism should also be considered.",

Bedside transthoracic echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65% and a hypokinetic right ventricle (TAPSE 13 mm, S wave 8 cm/s) associated with a severe systolic pulmonary hypertension (95 mmHg). A patent foramen ovale was present with a large thrombus originating from the right atrium and extending to the left atrium. Contrastenhanced CT-scan showed massive bilateral proximal pulmonary embolism(Figure 1ab).Because of the elevated risk of systemic embolism, thrombolysis was not considered. She was 4 transferred immediately to the operative room and as per our routine practice, in our center on these unstable patients, cardiopulmonary bypass was established under local anesthesia, by surgical cut down of the femoral vessels at the level of the right groin. Surgical embolectomy was performed through median sternotomy after arresting the heart (Figure 1cd). The patient's clinical condition stabilized during her first week, in the intensive care unit. However, the patient had some degree of right heart failure and despite administration of fluid resuscitation and vassopressors, she developed a persistent vasoplegic syndrome. Also, weaning from the ventilator was not possible. A Doppler peripheral echography revealed the presence of a deep venous thrombosis at the level of the left leg without any floating clot inside the inferior vena cava. On day 8, she developed severe hypoxemia refractory to maximum mechanical ventilation. She was put on prone position during 16 hours which improved gas blood oxygenation. On day 9, while remaining in the supine position, the patient developed fever (42\u00b0C), hypoxemia (pO2 54 mmHg) and a severe septic shock. CT-scan was not done due to the instable clinical condition of the patient, but chest X-ray showed extensive bilateral interstitial infiltration (Figure 2). Transthoracic echocardiography was stable and showed no further impairment of the right or left ventricular function. The patient was tested for COVID-19 at this moment and a venous arterial extracorporeal life support was put as a rescue treatment (flow of 6.4 L/min). The PCR test for COVID-19 was positive. The clinical condition deteriorated rapidly and the patient died of multiorgan failure on the 28 th of March 2020 (day 10 after embolectomy).",
