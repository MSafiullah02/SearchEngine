Total Ig to TCV was initially detected at 7 and 14 d PI in Experiments 1 and 3. In addition, Ig gradually increased from 7 to 21 d PI and remained at 80 immunofluroescent antibody assay (IFA) titers or more thereafter. Lymphocyte proliferation responses of spleen cells to concanavalin A were higher in TCV-infected turkeys than in noninfected control turkeys with significant differences (P < 0.05) being noted at 14 and 63 d PI in Experiment 2 and at 3 and 28 d PI in Experiment 3.

In Experiment 3, the IgG isotype antibody response to TCV was markedly increased after 21 d PI and remained high until 63 d PI. The IgM isotype antibody response to TCV was 1.40 and 0.91 at 7 and 14 d PI, respectively. The IgA isotype antibody response to TCV was very low as detected at 7 (0.13), 14 (0.20), and 21 (0.17) d PI. Turkeys infected with TCV had significantly higher (P < 0.05) antibody response to sheep erythrocytes than noninfected controls at 7 d PI. Virus-specific lymphocyte proliferation response of spleen cells was significantly stimulated (P < 0.05) at 63 d PI in Experiment 3. The proportion of the CD4 + subpopulation of T lymphocytes was significantly increased (P < 0.05) at 1, 7, and 21 d PI in Experiment 3. The results indicate that humoral and cellular immunities to TCV are elicited in turkeys following infection with TCV. ments of the disease are often unsuccessful, and there are currently no effective vaccines or medications to prevent the disease. In order to develop strategies for diagnosis, control, and prevention, clarification of immune responses in turkeys infected with TCV is essential. In addition, studies of humoral and cellular immunities may lead to identifying the antigens and epitopes that are responsible for inducing protective immune responses. Such information is important for the development of effective vaccines and vaccination strategies.",

The observation of low-level specific IgA antibodies is in line with the fact that IgA is only a minor part (10 to 15%) of the Ig in serum and serum IgA has no known biological function. Most IgA is present in surface secretions such as mucus, tears, or saliva, where it serves as an important first-line of defense against infection by microbial pathogens. Activation of resting B cells to TCV-specific plasma cells is likely to occur in the local mucosa-associated immune tissue along the intestine. The observed stimulation of systemic antibody response probably reflected stimulation of local antibody responses.

Similar findings were also observed for pigs infected with transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (Brim et al., 1995) . However, a statistically significant difference of TCV-specific lymphocyte proliferation response between infected and normal control turkeys was found only at 63 d PI, which was largely due to the high lymphocyte proliferation responses of noninfected control turkeys to TCV antigen. The lymphocyte proliferation responses of noninfected control turkeys to TCV antigen were not due to contaminant infection of control turkeys with TCV, because noninfected controls were negative for TCV antigen as well as for antibodies to TCV. The TCV antigen used in the in vitro lymphocyte proliferation assay was prepared from infected turkey embryo intestines.

The cells expressing CD4 molecules recognize antigens restricted by MHC II on antigen-presenting cells and provide cytokine-driven expansion of B-and T cell-mediated specific immune responses. Enhancement of CD4 + cells proportion was noted in flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood cells following TCV infection in the present study. This finding is in line with a previous report that the CD4 + :CD8 + ratio in the spleen of coronavirus-positive PEMS poults was higher compared with the uninfected poults (Heggen et al., 1998) . The increase in proportion of CD4 + cells could account for the observed increase in humoral and cellular immunofunctional abilities. The positive effect of CD4 + (helper) T cells on the different aspects of immune system may be due to the increased number of cells as well as their innate functional ability, such as the production and release of cytokines. Secretion of interluekin (IL)-4 and IL-6 by activated helper T cells are crucial for activation, proliferation, and terminal differentiation of resting B cells to specific antibody-secreting plasma cells. IL-2 is required for activation, proliferation, and differentiation of resting CD8 + T cells to cytotoxic T effector cells. Two subsets of CD4 + T cells can be distinguished by the cytokines they secrete. Type 1 subset secrets IL-2 and interferon-\u03b3 and is responsible for the arm of cellular immunity. Type 2 subset secrets IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 and is responsible for the arm of humoral immunity. Further studies on the effects of TCV on levels of cytokines and on the relative levels of Type 1-like and Type 2-like activ-ity will clarify the interactions between the helper T cells and the immune status of turkey poults.",
