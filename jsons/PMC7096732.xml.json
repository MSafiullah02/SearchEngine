The vulnerability of island foxes to infectious disease was realized in 1999 when canine distemper virus (CDV) was suspected to cause a rapid population decline on SCA. Approximately 90% of the wild fox population on the eastern two-thirds of the island disappeared, leaving fewer than 150 known individuals (Timm et al., 2000). Distemper virus was confirmed in the only fox carcass available (Munson, L., unpublished). Concerns for future epidemics led to a re-assessment of pathogen exposure in the island fox.",

In 1973 antibodies to San Miguel sea lion virus (SMSLV) were detected in 6 of 85 (7%) SCZ foxes, thereby extending the host range for marine caliciviruses to canids (Prato et al., 1977). Foxes were presumably exposed to SMSLV through scavenging on beaches occupied by infected pinnipeds (Moore and Collins, 1995, Prato et al., 1977). A second survey of 100 SCZ foxes in 1973 did not detect antibodies against CDV, rabies, or leptospirosis, therefore Laughrin, 1977) cautioned that island foxes were at risk from health hazards presented by abandoned cats and dogs, and from bat species moving between the islands and the mainland.",

No antibodies against CDV were detected, but foxes on all six islands were exposed to CPV, with prevalence ranging from 5% to 59%. Exposure to CAV was common (72\u201397%), but absent in foxes on SCA and SCZ. Antibodies to CCV were found on only two islands, while CHV antibodies were found in a small number of foxes. Antibodies to the protozoal parasite, Toxoplasma gondii were present on all islands but SMI in 1988, and Leptospira interrogans serovar icterohaemorrhagiae antibodies were detected only on SCZ (Garcelon et al., 1992). A subsequent survey conducted during the northern island fox population decline (1994\u20131997) on SMI, SCZ and SCI detected fewer foxes exposed to CPV compared to 1988 and documented the new presence of CAV antibodies in 58% of SCZ foxes sampled (Roemer et al., 2001). The emergence of CAV on SCZ may have occurred via domestic dog contact or via spillover from the sympatric population of island spotted skunk. Immediately following the 1999 SCA fox decline, a survey of foxes detected CDV antibodies, including high titers suggestive of recent infection (Timm et al., 2000). Preliminary surveillance of sympatric feral cats detected CDV antibodies, suggesting spillover of CDV into this species (Timm et al., 2000).",

This survey was considered critical to ensure the health of foxes in captivity and to identify threats on islands where fox populations remained in the wild or would be released from captive breeding programs. Furthermore, the dramatic population declines and the subsequent placement of island foxes into captive breeding facilities may have altered the ecology of pathogens in island foxes through reduced acquired immunity or increased pathogen concentration at the sites of captive breeding. To address these concerns, exposure to selected infectious disease agents that could threaten fox persistence was examined by conducting a systematic serologic survey of foxes and sympatric feral cats for antibodies against pathogens known to infect canids. Feral cats were also surveyed for exposure to feline-specific diseases that cause immune suppression and thereby increase the susceptibility of cats to infection with canid pathogens.",

Birthplace (wild or captivity) was noted for foxes being held in captivity. Age class was determined for wild-caught foxes using tooth eruption and wear pattern of the first upper molar (Wood, 1958).

No foxes younger than five months of age were sampled to eliminate the possibility of maternal antibody interference with test results. Fox age was classified as young (age class 0\u20131 or <2 years of age) or adult (age class 2\u20134 or >2 years of age) for statistical analyses, and both age classes were well represented, with 56% of the samples from young and 44% from adult foxes.

The existence of CDV-antibody positive and suspect young foxes on SCA, SNI and SCZ for three consecutive years indicates that some foxes were recently exposed to distemper in the absence of detectable mortality in radio-collared individuals and recovered carcasses. This apparent survival of exposed foxes contrasts with the high mortality suspected to be caused by CDV in 1999 on SCA (Timm et al., 2000). Mortality rates from CDV may differ among populations because of the genetic resistance of the host, virulence of CDV strains (Lednicky et al., 2004), or co-infection with other pathogens such as CPV or T. gondii. Concurrent CDV and toxoplasmosis has caused mortality in gray foxes (Davidson et al., 1992, Kelly and Sleeman, 2003), and other pathogens including rabies, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Cryptosporidium sp. have also occurred concurrent with distemper in gray foxes (Black et al., 1996, Davidson et al., 1992, Hoff et al., 1974). Additionally, the abundance of domestic dogs on SCA increases the risk of a more virulent CDV strain being transmitted from dogs to foxes.",

Epidemic cycles of CDV are common in raccoons and gray foxes when the number of susceptible (i.e. unexposed) individuals becomes high (Hoff et al., 1974, Roscoe, 1993). Accordingly, the absence of CDV-antibody positive young foxes all three years on SCI suggests recent exposure may not be occurring and that an increasing proportion of the population is susceptible.",

            "text": "In contrast to previous findings (Garcelon et al., 1992), our data indicate that a proportion of foxes on all six islands sampled prior to the decline in 1988 were exposed to CDV. The most likely reason for this discrepancy is higher test sensitivity of the Cornell SN assay, allowing the detection of low level antibody titers that were not detectable previously. False positive results could be due to non-specific antibody binding, but if this had occurred, all foxes tested would be expected to have some level of background activity in the assay. Although the occurrence of false positive results cannot be definitively ruled out, we carefully scrutinized positive test results, ruled out cross-reactions with closely related morbilliviruses, and evaluated assay performance on island foxes pre- and post-vaccination to ensure the test was discriminating between negative and positive results for the same individuals. Additionally, the long-term storage of the 1988 samples (likely reducing detectable antibody levels) and our conservative test cutoff make it even more unlikely that these are false positive results. Concerns that the high test sensitivity of the Cornell SN assay may over-estimate exposure to CDV were the reason for our designating a large proportion of population as CDV-antibody suspect. If suspect results represent true CDV exposure, there would be further evidence that CDV is endemic across most islands. Re-analyzing the 1988 fox samples with the more sensitive assay allowed us to compare our study results directly with samples from before the decline and document a previous exposure to canine distemper virus. It is possible that a low pathogenicity island-fox adapted CDV strain evoking low antibody titers evolved and now circulates among island foxes without the continued presence of domestic dogs.",

Most naturally infected animals are protected for life, regardless of antibody titer (Appel and Summers, 1995). However, in domestic dogs, previous vaccination does not guarantee protection from an overwhelming viral infection or challenge with a highly pathogenic CDV strain (Greene and Appel, 1998). All but one CDV-antibody positive island fox in our study had natural exposure titers of less than 1:100; similarly low level antibody titers (<1:100) occur in island foxes after CDV vaccination (Timm et al., 2000). Due to concerns about the lack of CDV exposure in captive-born foxes and that a strain of CDV more pathogenic to foxes might be introduced, all foxes in captivity (including those foxes subsequently released from captivity) are now vaccinated with a canary-pox vectored CDV vaccine shown to be safe for use in this species (Timm et al., 2000). Recently a sub-set of the wild populations on SCA, SCZ, and SCI also were opportunistically vaccinated against CDV due to the critically low population numbers left in the wild (Coonan, 2003). Although vaccination interferes with our ability to discern whether CDV is endemic or epidemic, the need to protect the small number of remaining foxes from extinction warrants this intervention for the most at-risk populations.",

Rabies outbreaks in African wild dogs (Kat et al., 1995) and Ethiopian wolves (Canis simensis) (Randall et al., 2006, Sillero-Zubiri et al., 1996) and the CDV epidemic in lions (Panthera leo) from the Serengeti (Roelke-Parker et al., 1996) were believed to have originated from nearby domestic dog populations. On the California Channel Islands there is also risk of generalist pathogens like CDV spilling over from foxes or dogs into sympatric marine mammal populations, as was observed in Lake Baikal (Phoca sibirica) and Caspian seals (Phoca caspica) (Grachev et al., 1989, Kennedy et al., 2000). Domestic dogs are rarely permitted on the islands except for Santa Catalina where residents and tourists can bring their dogs. The unregulated travel of people and their pet dogs between Catalina and mainland California poses a constant threat to foxes.",

The presence of CDV antibodies in two feral cats on SCA likely occurred via spillover from foxes or dogs. The two CDV-antibody positive cats were also exposed to FIV and FeLV, possibly making these individuals more susceptible to CDV infection. Exposure to CDV in feral and domestic cats has been previously reported (Appel et al., 1974, Ikeda et al., 2001), but it is not known whether cats that are immunocompromised due to FeLV or FIV infection are capable of shedding CDV into the environment. However, immunocompromised cats are vulnerable to other opportunistic diseases, including toxoplasmosis (Hoover and Mullins, 1991, Lin et al., 1992, Pedersen and Barlough, 1991). Foxes living on islands with feral cats have the opportunity to ingest T. gondii oocysts in cat feces, in addition to the tissue cysts in prey items (Tenter et al., 2000). The documentation of greater mortalities with concurrent distemper and T. gondii infection in gray foxes and domestic dogs provides support for controlling cats to reduce the numbers of infectious oocysts that are shed into the environment.",

Previous studies and anecdotal reports from island residents suggest that fox population sizes fluctuated widely in the past (Laughrin, 1980). Island foxes can occur at much higher densities than gray foxes (3\u201314/km2 vs. 0.4/km2) which may increase the rate of pathogen transmission between susceptible animals (Garcelon and Schmidt, 2005, Grinnell et al., 1937, Laughrin, 1980). During the 1970s, fox numbers and density remained very low (0.5 foxes/km2) on SCA. Additionally, a dramatic decrease in foxes trapped (from 24 to 2) and fox density (11 foxes/km2 to 2 foxes/km2) occurred on SNI between 1971 and 1974, and further decreased (3 foxes, 0.5 foxes/km2) in 1977 (Laughrin, 1980). Laughrin\u2019s data correlates well with recent work examining major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene diversity in island foxes, which suggests that the current degree of genetic monomorphism at neutral loci and high MHC gene variation in SNI foxes resulted from an extreme population bottleneck occurring between 20 and 40 years ago and resulting in less than 10 individuals (Aguilar et al., 2004). Although speculative, an infectious disease outbreak on SNI similar to what was observed on SCA in 1999 could explain the dramatic decrease in fox numbers observed by Laughrin, and resulted in the population bottleneck described by Aguilar and colleagues. Strong selection for resistance to CDV, as a result of previous epidemics, could explain the relatively high CDV exposure prevalence in the absence of clinical disease in some island fox populations today.",

Vaccination of a portion of the wild foxes against CDV and rabies should also be considered where the remaining wild populations are at critically low numbers. If possible, efforts should be made to allow natural cycling of less pathogenic viruses already in the ecosystem to help protect against future epidemics, as long-term vaccination of island foxes will likely become impractical once populations have recovered.
