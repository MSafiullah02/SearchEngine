            "text": "The neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) infects multiple cell types in the central nervous system (CNS) and causes acute encephalomyelitis and demyelination in rodents (Marten et al., 2001, Wang et al., 1990). Acute inflammatory responses in the CNS involve production of matrix metalloproteinases, pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, and recruitment of both innate and adaptive immune cells (Bergmann et al., 2003, Glass et al., 2002, Li et al., 2004, Marten et al., 2001, Zhou et al., 2005b). JHMV replication is controlled by T cells, prominently CD8+ T cells, about 2 weeks after infection (Bergmann et al., 2003, Marten et al., 2001). Nevertheless, viral RNA and inflammatory cells persist in the CNS long after clearance of infectious virus (Marten et al., 2001). Neutralizing antibodies are crucial for the final stage of clearance of infectious virus and prevent recrudescence of persisting virus (Lin et al., 1999, Ramakrishna et al., 2003). A pathological hallmark of JHMV infection is ongoing immune-mediated demyelination, similar to the human demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis. Although there is little evidence for demyelination in immune-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) or recombination activating gene 1\u2212/\u2212 (RAG1\u2212/\u2212) mice, numerous depletion and adoptive transfer studies implicate both innate and adaptive cell types in contributing to demyelination (Fleming et al., 1993, Houtman et al., 1995, Marten et al., 2001, Stohlman and Hinton, 2001). Although NK cells and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells display anti-viral activity during CNS infection in the absence of \u03b1\u03b2T cells (Dandekar and Perlman, 2002, Paya et al., 1989, Trifilo et al., 2004), a protective role for these innate cells has yet to be confirmed in a non-lymphopenic host. Similarly, although \u03b3\u03b4 T cells can influence demyelination during JHMV infection of immunocompromised hosts (Dandekar et al., 2005, Dandekar and Perlman, 2002), their pathogenic contribution in the presence of \u03b1\u03b2 T cells, which constitute a vastly larger inflammatory population, remains to be confirmed.",

            "text": "NK cells and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells both require IL-15 for development and homeostatic maintenance (Kennedy et al., 2000). IL-15 can be produced by many cell types, including microglia and activated astrocytes (Hanisch et al., 1997, Kurowska et al., 2002, Lee et al., 1996, Li et al., 2004, Maslinska et al., 2002, Nagai et al., 2001). This pleiotropic factor further supports NK cell expansion during infection (Lodolce et al., 1998, Nguyen et al., 2002) and is important for homeostatic maintenance of memory CD8+ T cells (Becker et al., 2002, Tan et al., 2002). Induction of IL-15 following mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection of CNS-derived cells (Li et al., 2004) and during experimental autoimmune encephalitis (Tran et al., 2000) implies a role of this cytokine in enhancing both innate and adaptive CNS immune responses. This notion is consistent with reports suggesting a correlation between increased IL-15 expression and progression of multiple sclerosis (Blanco-Jerez et al., 2002, Kivisakk et al., 1998, Losy et al., 2002, Pashenkov et al., 1999), which may reflect pro-inflammatory properties of IL-15 (Ma et al., 2000).",

IL-15 may affect CNS inflammation, viral clearance and demyelination directly or via activities of NK cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and CD8+ T cells. Naive IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice have no NK cells and diminished peripheral CD8+ T cells, especially within the CD122+ (IL-2/15 R\u03b2 chain), CD44+ memory subset (Kennedy et al., 2000). However, following peripheral infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), recombinant vaccinia virus and recombinant Sindbis virus, no defects in CD8+ T cell expansion were detected (Becker et al., 2002, Zuo et al., 2005). Furthermore, initial expansion of CD8+ T cells was only marginally affected following vesicular stomatitis virus infection (Schluns et al., 2002). Confirming effective CD8+ T cell function, peripheral infections were all controlled in IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice with kinetics similar to wild-type (wt) mice (Becker et al., 2002, Schluns et al., 2002, Zuo et al., 2005). These data predicted that virus-specific CD8+ T cell expansion should not be significantly affected following JHMV infection, providing a model to monitor the influence of NK and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells during CNS infection of a relatively immunocompetent host.",

Although the frequency of virus-specific effector CD8+ T cells recruited to the CNS was reduced compared to wt mice, clearance of infectious virus was only slightly delayed. Despite the absence of NK cells, there was no evidence for delayed IFN\u03b3-induced MHC expression on CNS resident cells, suggesting that these effectors do not contribute significantly to viral clearance or enhanced adaptive immune effector functions within the CNS. Furthermore, the absence of innate lymphocytes and reduced CD8+ T cell numbers did not ameliorate clinical disease or demyelination. Thus, despite the pleiotropic role of IL-15 in regulating innate and adaptive immune responses (Ma et al., 2000), little evidence was obtained supporting a role of either NK cells or \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in JHMV-induced encephalomyelitis or demyelination in otherwise immunocompetent hosts.",

The mean day of onset, extent of clinical disease, morbidity and recovery from acute JHMV infection of IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice were similar to those of wt mice (data not shown). To determine how the composition of bone marrow-derived CD45hi inflammatory cells was altered in the absence of IL-15, CNS inflammatory cells were characterized by flow cytometry. The absence of NK cells and reduced peripheral CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets in IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice only slightly diminished the overall numbers of inflammatory cells recruited into the CNS during acute JHMV infection (Table 1\n). NK cells were rapidly recruited into the CNS in wt mice, peaked at day 5 p.i. and then declined to barely detectable levels by day 14 p.i., in contrast to their absence from the CNS of infected IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice. Macrophages constituted the vast majority of CNS infiltrating cells in both groups early following infection, suggesting IL-15-independent recruitment. Although the percentage of macrophages declined as inflammation increased, they were retained at similar levels in both groups (Table 1). The absence of IL-15 resulted in diminished CD8+ T cell recruitment, possibly reflecting the overall reduction in peripheral CD8+ T cells (Kennedy et al., 2000, Tan et al., 2002, Zuo et al., 2005). No significant differences in either percentages or expression levels of activation markers, i.e., CD43, CD44 and CD62L, on infiltrating CD8+ T cells were detected comparing the two groups (data not shown). Although there was no apparent increase in CD4+ T cells early in infection, substantially higher percentages of CD4+ T cells were evident in the CNS of IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice during peak inflammation (Table 1). Surprisingly, although IL-15 affects the \u03b3\u03b4 T cell population associated with the gastrointestinal track (Kennedy et al., 2000), \u03b3\u03b4 T cells constituted between 1.4 and 2.1% of the inflammatory population at day 5 p.i. in the CNS of wt and IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice and remained between 0.8 and 2.1% out to day 17 p.i.

The reduced CD8+ T cell percentage in the CNS of infected IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice thus likely reflects the reduced memory cells in lymphoid organs (Kennedy et al., 2000, Tan et al., 2002). Furthermore, expansion of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice following peripheral infection is not compromised (Becker et al., 2002, Schluns et al., 2002, Zuo et al., 2005), consistent with the concept that IL-15 acts primarily to sustain memory cells (Prlic et al., 2002). To test how IL-15 deficiency impacts virus-specific CD8+ T cell expansion following an infection restricted to the CNS, JHMV-specific CD8+ T cells were compared in the CNS, spleen and CLN, the primary site of T cell priming following CNS infection (Dorries, 2001, Marten et al., 2003). The proportions of JHMV spike protein-specific CD8+ T cells were comparable in spleen and CLN in IL-15\u2212/\u2212 and wt mice at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 1A), supporting IL-15-independent expansion (Becker et al., 2002, Zuo et al., 2005). Analysis of the CNS at day 7 p.i. revealed slightly reduced percentages of tetramer+ cells within the CD8+ T cell population derived from the infected IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice. Surprisingly, although the majority of tetramer+ cells in secondary lymphoid organs expressed CD122 (IL-2/15R\u03b2), virus-specific CD8+ T cells recruited into the CNS were CD122\u2212/dim in both groups (Fig. 1). These data imply either preferential recruitment of the CD122\u2212/dim population or downregulation of CD122 expression upon CNS entry. Overall, the relative number of virus-specific CD8+ T cells within the CNS was reduced 2\u20133-fold in the infected IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wt mice during peak inflammation at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 1B). Although the CD8+ T cells in the CNS of wt mice declined as infectious virus and viral antigen was reduced, the total number of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in the CNS of the IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice remained constant (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that induction, expansion and recruitment of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in response to an infection localized to the CNS are independent of IL-15.",

Nevertheless, JHMV replication in the CNS of IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice was not significantly affected at days 3 or 5 p.i. and only slightly increased at day 7 p.i. compared to wt mice (Fig. 2A). Overall, IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice controlled infectious virus within the CNS with kinetics very similar to wt mice (Fig. 2). Viral antigen in the CNS of IL-15\u2212/\u2212 and wt mice was compared at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 2B) to determine if the slight increase in infectious virus represented altered viral tropism. However, no difference in either the amount or distribution of viral antigen, predominantly in astrocytes and oligodendroglia, was detected when comparing both groups (Fig. 2B). This suggests an apparent redundancy of NK cells, and a sufficient virus-specific CD8+ T cell response to mediate virus control in the CNS in the absence of IL-15.",

            "text": "In the quiescent CNS, resident glial cells express few if any MHC molecules. However, pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferons and TNF, induce increased expression of MHC molecules in the CNS during inflammation (Bergmann et al., 2003, Liu and Lane, 2001, Zhou et al., 2005b). JHMV infection induces MHC class I molecules on microglia, independent of IFN\u03b3; however, expression of MHC class II molecules depends exclusively on IFN\u03b3 (Bergmann et al., 2003). Although NK cells appeared to play no direct role in viral clearance, they may nevertheless enhance early MHC molecule expression on glial cells via IFN\u03b3 secretion and thus optimize \u03b1\u03b2 T cell effector function. To evaluate a potential role of NK cells in enhancing antigen presentation capacity, the kinetics of MHC class I and II upregulation were assessed on microglia (Fig. 3\n). Class I molecule expression emerged as early as day 3 p.i. in both IL-15\u2212/\u2212 and wt mice (Fig. 3A). Although microglia derived from infected IL-15\u2212/\u2212 expressed less class I molecules at day 5 p.i., expression was maximal on microglia in both groups of mice by day 7 p.i. In contrast to class I expression, class II molecules remained below detection on microglia from either group at day 3 p.i. and only increased slightly by day 5 p.i. This delay in class II expression, relative to class I, was overcome at day 7 p.i. when \u223c90% of microglia derived from both groups of JHMV-infected mice expressed MHC class II molecules (Fig. 3B). The absence of an evident difference in MHC molecule upregulation suggests little, if any, contribution of innate lymphocytes to IFN\u03b3 secretion early during infection. Maximal MHC molecule expression coincident with peak CNS T cell numbers underscores the critical role of \u03b1\u03b2 T cells as a source of IFN\u03b3 in regulating both class I and class II molecule expression on CNS resident cells.",

Furthermore, the majority of CNS CD8+ T cells in both groups apparently downregulated CD122 expression (Fig. 1A), suggesting low responsiveness to ligands involved in CD122 binding. CNS CD8+ T cell functions were evaluated to support phenotypic similarities observed in both groups. Virus-specific IFN\u03b3 production was detected in \u223c20% of infiltrating CD8+ T cells in both IL-15\u2212/\u2212 and wt mice at day 7 p.i. (Fig. 4A). Consistent with the slight reduction in CD8+ T cells infiltrating the CNS of the infected IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice, CNS mononuclear cells from IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice expressed reduced ex vivo cytolytic activity compared to wt mice at the population level (Fig. 4B). However, adjustment to cytolysis per tetramer+ CD8+ T cell revealed no differences in lytic capacity between cells from the CNS of IL-15\u2212/\u2212 and wt mice (Fig. 4B). Therefore, despite decreased CD8+ T cell numbers within the CNS in the absence of IL-15, differentiation to anti-viral effector T cells, based on both the ability to secrete IFN\u03b3 and express cytolytic activity, was not affected. Similar kinetics of class I expression (Fig. 3) supports the notion that CD8+ T cells are a prominent source of IFN\u03b3 secretion at day 5 p.i. as only few class II expressing cells are available to trigger IFN\u03b3 secretion by CD4+ T cells.",

It is furthermore vital for viral clearance from oligodendrocytes (Bergmann et al., 2004, Parra et al., 1999). Similar patterns of MHC expression on microglia suggested comparable IFN\u03b3 production in both groups, despite the absence of NK cells and reduced virus-specific CD8+ T cells within the inflamed CNS (Table 1; Fig. 1). Therefore, CNS IFN\u03b3 levels were measured to test whether MHC upregulation was saturated, thus under representing in vivo IFN\u03b3 levels. IFN\u03b3 was already present in the CNS of both groups at day 5 p.i., increased sharply at day 7 p.i., coincident with the peak of T cell responses (Table 1), and rapidly declined at day 10 p.i. (Fig. 5A). These data suggest a downregulation of IFN\u03b3 secretion within the CNS as both infectious virus and viral antigen are cleared, even though both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were still abundant (Table 1). The slight over-representation of CD4+ T cells within the CNS inflammatory population in IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice suggested the possibility that this population may compensate for decreased CD8+ T cells. This interpretation is supported by the ability of nearly equivalent frequencies (\u223c20%) of CNS-derived virus-specific CD4+ T cells to secrete IFN\u03b3 (Fig. 5B).",

An exception is the increased mortality following neurovirulent vaccinia virus infection (Kennedy et al., 2000). This report is the first to demonstrate that IL-15 is not required to control a coronavirus infection, confined to the CNS and dependent on CD8+ T cell responses for anti-viral control (Bergmann et al., 2003, Marten et al., 2001).",

            "text": "JHMV infection is restricted to the brain and spinal cord and results in the recruitment of multiple innate and adaptive effector cells, including both NK and CD8+ T cells (Marten et al., 2001). Several observations suggested that NK cell activity may be important in early control of JHMV, possibly prior to induction of adaptive immunity. Among these are the slight reduction in virus replication in SCID mice (Houtman et al., 1995) and the apparent partial control of infectious virus in the CNS of mice deficient in either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells (Williamson and Stohlman, 1990). Early control of a less neurovirulent MHV-A59 strain engineered to express CXCL10 in RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice also supports NK cell-mediated anti-viral function (Trifilo et al., 2004). By contrast, analysis of NK deficient IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice failed to detect any evidence for delayed or reduced IFN\u03b3 production or other anti-viral activity following JHMV infection. Both direct analysis of IFN\u03b3 and indirect analysis via MHC class II upregulation on microglia revealed no differences during the time of maximal NK cell recruitment. The notion that NK cells do not exert detectable effector function within the inflamed CNS in immunocompetent hosts was further supported by the inability to detect NK cytolytic activity in splenocytes of infected wt mice (data not shown). The discrepancy between the apparently redundant role of NK cells in immunocompetent mice and the data obtained in RAG1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Trifilo et al., 2004) may reside in the more rapid and increased NK cell inflammation achieved by over-expression of CXCL10.",

Rapid activation of CD8+ T cells was also evident following peripheral JHMV infection (unpublished data). Induction and expansion of T cells in response to CNS infection occur in secondary lymphoid organs (Dorries, 2001, Marten et al., 2003). Consistent with signaling through the IL-2/15R\u03b2 chain CD122 during the expansion phase, possible via IL-2, the majority of JHMV-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleen and CLN expressed CD122 in both IL-15\u2212/\u2212 and wt mice. Interestingly, the vast majority of CD8+ T cells recruited into the CNS in the brain were CD122\u2212. CD122 expression is thus either downregulated after CD8+ T cells enter the CNS, or alternatively, the CD122\u2212/lo population preferentially traffics into the CNS. The first explanation is favored by the low frequency of CD122\u2212/lo virus-specific CD8+ T cells in lymphoid organs as well as the downregulation of CD122 on splenic CD8+ T cells after 6 h in vitro stimulation with peptide (data not shown). Whether CD122 is downregulated as a result of abundant Ag stimulation or withdrawal of CD122 ligands, e.g., IL-2, is presently unclear. However, the dispensability of CD122 of CNS localized T cells is consistent with the notion that T cell expansion is inhibited following entry into infected non-lymphoid parenchymal tissues. In the CNS, T cell expansion appears to be inhibited by prostaglandins and other downregulatory factors (Irani and Griffin, 2001). However, recent evidence from the Theiler's murine encephalitis virus model disputes this notion by demonstrating de novo priming and proliferation of auto-reactive TCR transgenic T cells within the CNS (McMahon et al., 2005). Irrespectively, the apparent survival of CD122\u2212/lo polyclonal CD8+ T cells in the CNS is consistent with the absence of an adverse effect of IL-2 inhibition during JHMV infection of the CNS (Zhou et al., 2005a).",

The small, but reproducible, increase in infectious virus in the CNS of the IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice at day 7 p.i. may thus reflect the overall reduction in the CNS infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Nevertheless, IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice controlled JHMV replication with kinetics similar to wt mice, disputing an overall defect in anti-viral activity. JHMV clearance from the CNS in wt mice is dependent upon both perforin-mediated cytolysis and IFN\u03b3 secretion (Bergmann et al., 2004, Lin et al., 1997, Parra et al., 1999). Direct measurement of IFN\u03b3 showed comparable amounts of IFN\u03b3 suggesting that virus-specific CD4+ T cells may compensate for reduced CD8+ T cells in IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice. Although a considerable fraction of IL-15\u2212/\u2212 CD4+ T cells produced IFN\u03b3 following Ag stimulation, no evidence for altered virus tropism or enhanced MHC class II expressing macrophages/microglia was detected. Overall, this finding underscores flexibility of T cell responses and a synergy between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in controlling CNS viral infections.",

However, no differences in the extent or distribution of demyelinated lesions were found in either brains or spinal cords of infected IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wt mice. Although the gastrointestinal tract of IL-15\u2212/\u2212 mice is deficient in \u03b3\u03b4 T cells (Kennedy et al., 2000), it was surprising to detect similar, albeit small numbers of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the CNS of both wt and IL-15\u2212/\u2212-infected mice throughout acute infection. However, no significant differences between the groups could be detected in these small populations at any given time point. Therefore, the analysis of JHMV pathogenesis in IL-15\u2212/\u2212 was unable to shed light on the potential role of this T cell subset, implicated in JHMV induced demyelination in nude mice (Dandekar et al., 2005, Dandekar and Perlman, 2002). In conclusion, our data demonstrate that IL-15 is not essential for effective anti-viral immunity against a neurotropic coronavirus infection. Although NK cells are recruited into the infected CNS, no evidence could be found to support either direct anti-viral effector functions or indirect function mediated via enhanced adaptive immunity. Both IL-15 and NK cells are thus dispensable for inflammation, demyelination and pathogenesis in the CNS. These data underscore the importance of adaptive immune responses during JHMV infection of the CNS.",

Virus-specific CD8+ T cells were detected with PE labeled Db-S510 class I tetramer as previously described (Zuo et al., 2005). Stained cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Forward and side scatter signals obtained in linear mode were used to establish a gate containing live lymphocytes. A minimum of 2.5 \u00d7 105 viable cells were stained and 0.5\u20132 \u00d7 105 events per sample analyzed using CellQuestPro software (Becton Dickinson). Intracellular staining for IFN\u03b3 was performed as described previously (Zuo et al., 2005).

Peptides were synthesized by the University of Southern California Norris Cancer Center Microchemistry Laboratory and purity assessed by HPLC and mass spectrometry. CHB3 cells (I-Ab) were derived from a B-cell tumor (Bishop et al., 1993) and used at a ratio of 5 CHB3 cells to 1 lymphocyte (Haring et al., 2001).
