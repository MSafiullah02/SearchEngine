With full-length genome sequences, Zhou and colleagues found that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus [2]. Wu and colleagues performed phylogenetic analysis on the complete viral genome and deduced that the virus was most closely related to a group of SARS-like coronavirus previously sampled from bats in China [3]. Ji and colleagues performed comprehensive sequence analysis and comparison in conjunction with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different animal species based on the 2019-nCoV RNA genome sequence, and the results showed the virus to be a recombinant virus between the bat coronavirus and another coronavirus with unknown origin. They also suggested that snake is the most probable animal reservoir due to the virus\u2019s RSCU bias being closest to snake [4]. Zhu and colleagues used deep learning algorithms to analyze the gene sequences of novel coronaviruses and other coronaviruses to predict potential viral hosts. Their results indicated that bats and minks may be the two potential hosts of the novel coronavirus, while minks may be the intermediate hosts of the virus [5]. The novel coronavirus showed a similar pattern of infection to other coronaviruses in humans, particularly severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-nCoV), Bat SARS-like CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-nCoV). After comparing coronaviruses in other vertebrates, the study found that the bat coronaviruses had the most similar infection patterns to the novel coronaviruses. After comparing the infection patterns of other vertebrate coronavirus hosts, the infection patterns of minks were found to be most similar to those of the novel coronavirus.",

Similarly, ACE2 is also the receptor for SARS-nCoV and NL63 [7\u20139]. According to their model, the binding strength between 2019-nCoV and ACE2 is higher than the threshold required for virus infection, albeit being weaker than that between SARS-nCoV and ACE2. Zhou and colleagues conducted virus infectivity studies and showed that ACE2 is essential for 2019-nCoV to enter HeLa cells [10]. These data indicated that ACE2 is likely to be the receptor for 2019-nCoV. Zhao and colleagues analyzed normal lung tissue cells of eight healthy individuals, and found that the only Asian donor has over five times as much ACE2 expressing cell ratio than white and African American donors [11]. These results point to a possible heightened susceptibility of Asian population, although more evidence is needed to draw such conclusion.",

The team's new analysis was based on a model, the outbreak boundary control decision support framework, released last December, which integrates the dynamics of the outbreak and outbreak control of the new coronavirus pneumonia into a decision support tool to facilitate border control in the early stages of an outbreak to mitigate further spread. The team used a random set of population epidemic simulation tools to simulate the dynamics of the epidemic, and considered the border protection mechanism (immigration inspection) in the modeling process, which is mainly used to identify infected people or high-risk groups [23]. The aggregation population model is mainly constructed based on the population network, which is divided into urban and intercity parts, and the edge of the network is the air line between different cities. At each node of the network, the researchers used a discrete-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model to simulate the dynamics of an outbreak.",

At the same time, the team estimated that the number of 2019-nCoV cases in China may have been much higher than reported for the whole of January, up to about 20,000 cases of 2019-nCoV in the country as of 25th January 25 (the number reported at the time was nearly 2000). Researchers also estimated that hundreds of people in Wuhan were infected in early December. The model is, however, limited by many factors, as explained by the team on their blog post. They are primarily due to the numbers being used are conservative estimates, the transmission of 2019-nCoV, such as the R0 value and incubation period, being uncertain, asymptomatic infections are not covered and only air travel was included [23].",

The children one is from < 2 months to 5 years old. From mild to acute respiratory distress levels, the respiratory rate and SpO2 are two important parameters for judging patients\u2019 clinical condition. For sepsis in adults, the patients\u2019 mental, circulating, and respiratory parameters are recommended to rank the severity; while in children, the definition of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) are used. In the septic shock adult patients, hypotension in adults is a substantial sign or vasopressor maintenance for mean atrial pressure \u2265 65 mmHg with lactate level > 2 mmol/L. In the septic shock for children, the criteria are based on the guideline of hemodynamic support of paediatric and neonatal Septic Shock from the American College of Critical Care Medicine [30].",

China\u2019s health authorities and the government have been moving quickly. In response to the spreading virus, isolation strategy has been used. Many cities including Wuhan have been put on quarantine since 23rd January, 2020, when millions of Chinese traditionally travel due to Lunar New Year. Planes, trains, ferries, subways, and buses cease operation, and roads in and out of the cities were closed. Residents were encouraged to wear masks in public. Many places that usually attract a large crowd, such as cafes, bars, and cinemas in many cities, Disneyland in both Shanghai and Hongkong, Forbidden City in Beijing, are now closed until further notice.

We calculated that the number of confirmed infections after 16th January 2020 grows at an exponential rate, with a doubling time of 1.8 days. This result is significantly different from the doubling time of 7.4 days found in Li\u2019s group, which was obtained from analyzing the cases before 4th January 2020. This might be due to several factors: at early stages, the lack of awareness for the disease and lack of detection methods would have hindered the disease detection and confirmation. Low number of confirmed cases would result in high uncertainty of the calculation.

Chen and colleagues found a greater number of men than women in the 99 cases of 2019-nCoV which they reported. In previous SARS and MERS outbreaks, men were also more likely to be infected than women [32]. This may have to do with the important role that both woman's X chromosomes and sex hormones play in the body's immune system [33].

Until now, a few cases of children infected have been reported with the youngest one is 10 years old. ARDS is a common symptom in the 2019-nCoV infection cases. SpO2 and respiration rate check became very important in the clinical practice. Mechanical ventilation is a major treatment of it, and it has been recommended in both guidelines. The low tidal volume, plateau pressure limitation, no oscillatory ventilation, and prone position have been evidenced as high proof [34]. The anti-virus medicine is recommended in the Chinese 4th edition. A recent publication reported 99 cases in Jinyin-Tan hospital were given anti-virus medicine such as oseltamivir (75 mg every 12 h, orally), ganciclovir (0.25 g every 12 h, intravenously), and lopinavir and ritonavir tablets (500 mg twice daily, orally), and the influence of the outcome has been mentioned in detail [32]. Short-term corticosteroids use is recommended in the Chinese 4th edition, the aim of which is to reduce the self-damage by over-reactive immune response. Antibiotic use is recommended when the patient has evidence of bacterial infection. Some patients in the 99 cases presented a rapid progress to ARDS, and the benefits of short-term use of methylprednisolone 1\u20132 mg/kg per day and intravenous immunoglobulin were observed in these patients [32]. These two guidelines are currently being used; however, some of the contents are still controversial, especially the benefits of steroids and antibiotic. Further study should be continued in the clinical practice. Our summary of WHO guidelines just included recommended contents. The controversial contents are excluded.",
