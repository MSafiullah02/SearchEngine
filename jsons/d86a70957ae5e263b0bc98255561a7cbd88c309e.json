Qigong's body regulation is aimed at relaxation, so the movements are typically gentle and smooth. Regulation of breath involves changes in respiratory movement, rhythm, and pattern. Breath in Qigong needs to be slow, long, and deep. Sometimes changes in breath pattern are also required, such as abdominal breathing, and breathing with phonation, both of which are typical patterns of Qigong respiration. Abdominal breathing refers to a breathing pattern with obvious abdomen movement, and breathing with phonation is a combination of breath and the production of speech sounds. Regulation of mind includes focusing attention and visualization. Most operations of mind regulation are similar to meditation, therefore Qigong is also considered a meditative movement. 8 Qigong originated in the primeval time of China as a means of self-care. According to the first historical record in China \"Shang Shu\", 4000 years ago, ancient Chinese people found that stretching and dancing could release pain. This is the rudiment of Qigong. Almost all religions and philosophical schools, such as Taoism, Buddhism, Traditional Chinese medicine, and martial arts, have elements of Qigong practice methods, with different appellations. In the 1950s, experts and scholars reached a consensus and coined this methodology \"Qigong\", and the first Qigong institute was established in China in 1954.",

Practitioners who have difficulty focusing their attention can concentrate on movements and actions in dynamic Qigong, which is an easier skill to master. Passive Qigong pays more attention to mind regulation. Attention training is an important and common technique of mind regulation that asks practitioners to focus attention on an object or on the present, which is similar to mindfulness meditation. According to theory of TCM, through extensive practice of focusing attention, practitioners can enter a state of tranquility. Passive Qigong has few requirements for physical strength, as it can be practiced in any posture without movement. In addition, for those with impaired body movement ability, passive Qigong is a better choice than dynamic Qigong. A study on mindfulness, conducted by Lacaille et al. 12 , indicated that prolonged mindfulness practice was associated with an increase in mindful responding, which was in turn associated with increased positive affect and with less perceived stress and negative affect. Thus, those who engage in extensive practice of passive Qigong may be likely to experience better psychological outcomes.",

Benson coined the physiological change elicited by meditation a \"relaxation response\". As a meditative movement, Qigong has been studied as a tool for stress management. Ryu et al. 14 observed changes in stress hormones during Qigong practice, and found that beta-endorphins increased in the middle of training while levels of adreno-cortico-tropic-hormone declined mid and post-practice suggesting decreased stress levels. It has been suggested that Qigong regulates emotion through enhancing nonreactivity to aversive thoughts and impulses by focusing attention, regulating the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis reactivity and the balance of the autonomic nervous system, and through changing the function of the brain, limbic system, and expression of genes linked to inflammatory responses and stress-related pathways. 15 In a meta-analysis on treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with Qigong, Wu et al. 16 ",

            "text": ", China, in December 2019, has rapidly spread throughout the world. Older people and patients with existing medical conditions are prone to have severe complications associated with Covid-19 infection. 1 Clinical practitioners and researchers are working to find effective treatments for COVID-19, and complementary and alternative medicine may be a feasible and valuable option. In China, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Qigong have played important roles in the battle against this disease. The Chinese herbs Qingfei Paidu decoction have been recommended by the National Health Commission of China as a treatment for COVID-19 infected patients with mild to moderate symptoms. 2 For COVID-19 infected patients with severe respiratory symptoms, the herbs were used in combination with Western medicine. In the Wuhan Fangcang Hospitals, field hospitals for the isolation of mild cases instead of home quarantine, patients practiced Ba Duan Jin Qigong under the guidance of TCM doctors for treatment and exercise. 3 This review discusses the application of Qigong in older people for the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of respiratory infectious diseases, including COVID-19.",

Tai-chi, Yi Jin Jing (Muscle Change Classic), Wu Qin Xi (Five-animal Exercise), Liu Zi Jue (Six-Healing Sounds), and Ba Duan Jin (The Eight Brocades) are examples of dynamic Qigong that have gained worldwide popularity. Contrastingly, passive Qigong techniques have almost no body movement, but require maintaining a certain posture and carrying out exercises mainly involving the breath and mind.",

Qiu et al. 26 studied a sample of elderly people using Ba Duan Jin and found CD4, CD4/CD8 and NK cell percentage increased after a 24-week program when compared to a control group who received health education without exercise. Yu et al. 27 observed the effect of Wu Qin Xi on NK-cell activity in elderly adults tested by lactate dehydrogenase release assay, and found that the activities of NK cells increased after practicing for half a year when compared with a blank control group. Study results indicated that Wu Qin Xi is a moderate intensity exercise for older people. According to Nieman, 28 moderate exercise can lower the risk of respiratory tract infection, and heavy exercise can increase the risk of infection. The effect of Qigong on specific immune response can be observed in the increase of immune cells and immunoglobulin. Chiang et al. 29 selected 20 sedentary males as subjects, and found that Tai-Chi increased the number of circulating myeloid dendritic cells when compared with a blank control group, but that plasmacytoid dendritic cells remained the same in both groups. The degree of growth in myeloid dendritic cell significantly increased with the years of practice. Vera et al. 30 examined the acute effect of Qigong on adults who participated in a 1-month-Taoist Qigong program. The researchers took blood samples the day before the experiment commenced and 1 hour after the last session of the training program ended, and found higher values in the number and the percentage of B lymphocytes, as compared with a control group that did not engage in the practice. Niu 31 investigated the effect of Tai-Chi on middle-aged participants and observed that blood IgA, IgG and IgM levels increased significantly in the Tai-Chi exercise group with increasing exercise time.The promotion of Qigong in the specific immune response has also been reflected in the level of antibodies after vaccination. In Irwin's study,32 participants took part inTai-Chi or health education for 25 weeks, and after 16 weeks of intervention, subjects were vaccinated with Varivax. They found the Tai-Chi group showed higher levels of cell-mediated immunity to VZV than the health education group. In Yang's study33 , older adults practiced Tai-Chi and Qigong for 5 months and then received the influenza vaccine during the first week of the intervention. Improvement of the magnitude and duration of the antibody response to influenza vaccine were observed when compared to the control group.",

Although research on the application of Qigong in the rehabilitation of respiratory infections is limited, researchers have shown that Qigong can promote the rehabilitation of other respiratory diseases which cause impaired respiratory function. Tong's meta-analysis 37 on 10 studies examined 993 participants who were in the stable stage of COPD infection. Results indicated that Qigong can improve lung function in COPD patients, including forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1), forced vital capacity rate of 1s (FEV1/FVC), and forced expiratory volume in 1s/predicted (FEV1/pre). Additionally, results showed that it can improve exercise capacity, Functional Task Evaluation, COPD Assessment Test for exercise, and increase the score of Short Form-36 Health Quality Survey, which indicates improvement in quality of life. The researchers analyzed the function of Ba Duan Jin, Yi Jin Jing and Liu Zi Jue respectively, and found the first two resulted in significant improvement, and that Liu Zi Jue did not have significant effect. However, other studies have shown Liu Zi Jue to be effective in the rehabilitation of COPD patients. A study by Li et al. 38 indicated that COPD patients' lung function (FEV1/pred, FEV1/FVC) improved significantly with Liu Zi Jue practice, as did the 6-minute walking test, 30-second sit-to-stand test, and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score. Chen 39 observed that in chronic bronchitis patients who practiced Ba Duan Jin, hospital stays decreased, and lung function (FEV1/FVC) and arterial blood gas analysis (PaO2, PaCO2)",

The technique is very straight forward: consciously move your stomach when inhaling, tightening your stomach muscles, and let them fall inward as you exhale, while focusing attention on breathing. Do not hold your breath.Abdominal breathing can enhance respiratory function, and create a relaxation response. Abdominal breathing has been found to stimulate the vagus nerve, 40 which can regulate breathing and help with relaxation. Focusing attention on breath is one of the simplest ways to achieve emotional regulation and to decrease anxiety-related dysfunctional thoughts about the pandemic. Abdominal breathing requires the least amount of exercise of the three Qigong exercises recommended, and can be practiced standing, sitting, or lying on the back so that it can meet the needs of practitioners with poor physical conditions or more serious illness. Since abdominal breathing can be practiced anytime, anywhere, and in most physical conditions, it is a highly recommended method for coping with COVID-19 related stress.2. Ba Duan JinBa Duan Jin exercise consists of eight separate, delicate, and smooth exercise movements, to achieve self-psychosomatic regulation and enhance function. Since Ba Duan Jin exercises emphasize body and Qi, slow body movements along with musculoskeletal stretching should be combined with physical relaxation, deep breathing, and mental concentration41 . Movements of the whole body can enhance physical well-being. According to TCM theory, stretching the upper limbs, where the lung meridians are, can facilitate Qi moving in the respiratory organs and thereby promote recovery from respiratory symptoms. Deep, rhythmic breathing along with slow bodily movements accompanied by mental focusing frequently leads to a state of meditation, which can produce a relaxation response and stress reduction. We recommend using Ba Duan Jin for the prevention of COVID-19 and treatment of respiratory symptoms if infected, as well as for the management of stress derived from the pandemic.3. Liu Zi JueLiu Zi Jue combines abdominal breathing and pursed lip breathing with uttering six different sounds, along with corresponding mild-body movements and a calm state of mind. This exercise is easy to learn and can be performed in any position including standing (preferred), sitting, or lying down, since the exercise mainly involves mild upper-body movements.42",
