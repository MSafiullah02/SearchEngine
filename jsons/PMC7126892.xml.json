            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged as the first severe and readily transmissible new disease of the 21st century and caused 8000 infections and more than 800 deaths in 2003 (Groneberg et al., 2003). The causative organism is a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that is distantly related to group II coronaviruses. The virus has a single-stranded RNA genome of \u223c29.7 kb that encodes at least 14 putative open reading frames (ORFs) (Peiris et al., 2003, Drosten et al., 2003) (\nFigure 1A). Two-thirds of the viral genome at the 5\u2032 end is organized as a single highly conserved ORF, known as ORF-1a/1ab, that is translated into two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (Ksiazek et al., 2003). Translation of pp1ab involves ribosomal frameshifting, a feature also seen in many other coronaviruses (Baranov et al., 2005, Snijder et al., 2003). Termed as the \u201creplicase polyproteins,\u201d pp1a and pp1ab are subsequently posttranslationally cleaved by two virus-encoded proteases, the 3C-like protease (the main protease or 3CL-Pro) and the papain-like cysteine protease (PLP), into 16 mature protein products (Snijder et al., 2003) (Figure 1A). These \u201cnonstructural proteins\u201d or nsPs (nsP1\u2013nsP16) form a giant replicase complex that participates in numerous functions during viral infection, such as replication of the RNA genome, processing of subgenomic RNA, and packaging of newly budding virions (Ziebuhr et al., 2001).",

Structures of three homologs from this superfamily, yeast Ymx7, E. coli Er58, and a conserved C-terminal domain of nonhistone macro-H2A from Archeoglobus fulgidus (AF1521), show that they all adopt a generic macro-H2A-like fold with minor variations. While the function of some members of this superfamily, like the human poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase, has been experimentally characterized (D'Amours et al., 1999), that of many others is yet to be determined.",

To our knowledge, this is the first crystal structure of this domain from positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. It reveals a close structural relationship with prototypical macro-H2A-like fold proteins. One of its sequence homologs, Poa1p (YBR022) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was recently functionally characterized as a highly specific phosphatase that removes the 1\u2033 phosphate group of ADP-ribose-1\u2033-phosphate (Appr-1\u2033-p) in the latter half of the tRNA splicing pathway in yeast (Shull et al., 2005), hinting at a similar substrate specificity for SARS ADRP. Using an in vitro assay, we experimentally validate that this ADRP domain of SARS nsP3 is indeed a phosphatase that removes the terminal 1\u2033 phosphate from Appr-1\u2033-p. To our knowledge, these results, combined with recently elucidated structures of two hypothetical proteins, suggest that a majority of macro-H2A fold members form a new family of nucleotide phosphatases.",

The final structural model refined against crystallographic data to 1.4 \u00c5 resolution has four subunits in the asymmetric unit in very similar conformations (rmsds < 0.4 \u00c5 for 166 C\u03b1 atoms). We do not observe electron density for a few residues at the C terminus of each of the four monomers. These include 5 residues in chain D, 15 residues in the chain A, and 9 residues each in the B and C monomers. The final refinement statistics and stereochemical parameters of the structure are listed in\nTable 1. Overall, each subunit consists of eight \u03b2 strands and six \u03b1 helices (\nFigure 2A). Strands 2\u20138 form a central seven-stranded \u03b2 sheet that has a strand order of 2387465. The outermost strands on either side are antiparallel to the rest. The six helices straddle the central \u03b2 sheet to form a three-layered \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b1 topology. Two of the subunits in the asymmetric unit form a loosely packed head-to-head dimer (Figure 2B). A short loop connecting strand 6 and helix H4 is involved in weak interfacial contacts with the conserved Gly-rich segment of the other monomer. The interface is fairly small at \u223c870 \u00c52 (435 \u00c52 per monomer) and predominantly nonpolar (60%). Residues that form the putative active site lie close to the dimer interface.

Both structures are members of the \u201cmacrodomain-like\u201d fold as defined in the SCOP database (Murzin et al., 1995). This fold includes two other structural homologs from E. coli, aminopeptidase A (PepA) and a hypothetical protein ymbD (Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium target Er58; PDB code: 1SPV). The topological connectivity of the secondary structural elements of these four proteins along with the ADRP domain of SARS nsP3 is shown in a similar orientation in\nFigure 3 (A, B, D, E, and F). All of them share the same three-layered \u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b1 core, with minor variations. They have a mixed \u03b2 sheet of six strands with strand order 165243. The first strand and the first helix are absent in bovine lens leucine aminopeptidase (BlLAP, Figure 3A). AF1521 has two insertions to this core, a \u03b2 strand inserted at the N terminus and an \u03b1 helix between strands 3 and 4 (Figure 3E). The SARS ADRP domain has two \u03b2 strands inserted at the N terminus, one of which forms part of the central \u03b2 sheet (Figure 3F). The sixth protein structure in Figure 3, Ymx7 from yeast (PDB code: 1TXZ), is a member of this fold and has a circular permutation (Figure 3C). The first strand and the first helix of this protein occupy structural positions that correspond to the last \u03b2 strand and the C-terminal helix (H6) of a canonical macro-like fold.",

Repeated soaking and cocrystallization attempts failed to yield cocrystals of SARS ADRP with ADP-ribose, perhaps because the active site is occluded by the dimer interface.

Many of the residues that interact with the ligand are conserved in the three structures.

A notable feature is that the invariant lysine of the Walker A motif is an arginine in some coronaviruses and is absent in others (Figure 1B). The third stretch, \u201cXVVGP,\u201d where X is often a conserved histidine, is in the middle of the polypeptide. Finally, a stretch of 4 residues mainly consisting of small hydrophilic amino acids and a glycine is present near the C terminus of the polypeptide chain (Figure 1B).

We therefore tested the ability of SARS ADRP to dephosphorylate Appr-1\u2033-p in vitro. We employed a generic assay that monitors the liberation of inorganic phosphate in solution during catalysis (Webb, 1992). The results are shown in\nFigure 5. We observed a sustained release of phosphate after the addition of increasing amounts of the substrate (Appr-1\u2033-p) to the assay containing fixed amounts of the enzyme (Figure 5A). Upon overnight incubation, the amount of phosphate released was proportional to the amount of the substrate added, suggesting that SARS ADRP indeed had the ability to dephosphorylate Appr-1\u2033-p into ADP-ribose and inorganic phosphate (Figure 5B). Further kinetic characterization of the enzyme shows that the dephosphorylation is relatively low, with a KM of 52.7 \u00b1 8.2 \u03bcM and a kcat of 5.19 min\u22121. While the observed catalytic efficiency of this enzyme is not very high, it is comparable to the values reported for Poa1p. In a TLC-based assay with radiolabeled substrates, both Poa1p and Hal2p, a known 3\u2032 phosphatase of 5\u2032,3\u2032-pAp, showed similar low catalytic yields (KM = 2.8 \u03bcM; kcat = 1.7 min\u22121 for Poa1p), but both enzymes were highly specific for the Appr-1\u2033-p substrate (Shull et al., 2005). A few well-known phosphatases whose activity has been monitored by the same assay (Wang et al., 1995) also show similar levels of activity.",

It is a remote homolog of the macrodomain superfamily, albeit with a circular permutation (Figure 3C). It also has a different set of catalytic residues at the active site when compared to classical macrodomains. Based on the structure of the ADP-ribose bound Ymx7, Kumaran et al. (2005) have speculated on a catalytic mechanism that involves three residues: Asp90, His145, and Asn80. While the histidine and asparagine residues are conserved in all three of the structures, Ymx7, AF1521, and SARS nsP3, the equivalent position of Asp90 of Ymx7 is an alanine in the other two (Ala50 in ADRP and Ala44 in AF1521-ADP-ribose complex; Figure 4D). This would imply that while the proposed mechanism might be correct in the case of yeast Ymx7, it cannot be the mode of dephosphorylation for either ADRP or AF1521. Instead, these two enzymes have a histidine (His45 in ADRP and His39 in AF1521) residue that might be in close proximity to the terminal 1\u2033 phosphate of the substrate and might therefore be involved in catalysis. Alternately, it might be speculated that the role of the predominant nucleophile might be played by one of the aspartates or glutamates from the loop 101NAGEDIQ107 in SARS and other coronaviral ADRPs. This loop shows large conformational changes in the apo and ligand bound forms of AF1521 and Ymx7 and is rich in acidic residues (Figure 1B). Further mechanistic studies, cocrystallization experiments, and mutagenesis of these residues that are implicated here are necessary to elucidate the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. Despite repeated attempts at soaking and cocrystallization, we have not been able to observe density of the bound substrate. A possible reason might be the limited accessibility of the active site, as it is buried in the dimer interface during crystal packing (Figure 2B).",

The unique differences between the active site of SARS ADRP and yeast Ymx7, both of which dephosphorylate the same substrate, imply that, while being structurally and functionally homologous, they probably employ different catalytic mechanisms. Further studies are needed to fully explore the functional significance of this enzyme in the larger context of the membrane bound replicase complex and its regulation of translation and replication of viral RNA. If true, the functional link between SARS ADRP and other nsPs highlighted here could provide new avenues for investigation of the replication process of the virus in infected cells, with the hope of developing therapeutic agents aimed at inhibiting viral replication.",

Increasing amounts of the substrate were added to the reaction mixture, and the ADRP reaction was monitored by changes in absorbance at 360 nm in a UV spectrophotometer. To check for phosphate contamination, appropriate control reactions were performed in the presence of enzyme, but with no substrate and vice versa. No measurable phosphate contamination was detected either from the enzyme preparation, substrate degradation, or from the buffers. The assay components were checked with known amounts of phosphate standard supplied by the manufacturer. A molar extinction coefficient of 11,000 M\u22121 cm\u22121 of the product of the PNP reaction at 360 nm was used to quantitate the amount of released inorganic phosphate (Etzkorn et al., 1994).",
