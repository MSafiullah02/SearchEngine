Nevertheless, this technology is still relatively new so we would like to highlight the pearls and pitfalls for POCUS users to use this tool to its full potential and ensure optimal patient care and safety.",

            "text": "There should be dedicated machines for patients with COVID-19. Nowadays, many handheld models are affordable even for low-resource regions and some can cost only one twentieth of an ordinary mid-range or high-end machine. In the intensive care unit (ICU), if the department can afford the expense, it is optimal to assign one machine to each ICU patient, similar to common practice of avoiding cross-contamination by allocating a single stethoscope at the bedside for each individual patient. Another measure to minimise the possibility of cross-contamination is to use individually packaged, single-use ultrasound gel.",

First, wireless models are better than those with a cable because they are easier to manipulate (even if put in a plastic probe cover) and remove the risk of the cable contacting the surrounding environment. Second, machines that can be wirelessly charged are preferable because they obviate the need of removing the plastic cover unnecessarily for recharging. Third, the devices that possess multiple probe functionalities in a single unit are desirable because they can be used to do various clinical tasks without additional tools\u2014eg, for patients with COVID-19 who require central venous catheter insertion as part of shock management, bedside cardiac ultrasound to assess ventricular function due to the risk of myocarditis,2 or have acute pulmonary heart disease from their demand of higher positive end-expiratory pressure.",

            "text": "Lung ultrasound has high sensitivity for detecting pleural thickening, subpleural consolidation, and ground-glass opacification equivalent in CT;3 however, one pitfall is that there are occasions in which other imaging modalities are needed. For instance, lung ultrasound might not be able to detect a centrally located consolidation from bacterial superinfection. Furthermore, like many POCUS applications, lung ultrasound is often unable to discern the chronicity of a lesion, limiting its power of early COVID-19 diagnosis in the population with pre-existing pulmonary conditions. Patients with underlying asthma can have respiratory wheeze, which is not visible by lung ultrasound. Apart from using a stethoscope, the degree of airway obstruction in a mechanically ventilated patient could be assessed by various parameters, such as expiratory flow and waveform capnography.",
