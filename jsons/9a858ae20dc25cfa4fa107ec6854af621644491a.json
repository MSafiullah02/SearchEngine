Indeed, digital participation allows people to be involved in different societal activities at an unprecedented scale through the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Still, enabling participation at scale requires making it seamless for people to: interact with a variety of software platforms, get information from connected physical objects and software services, and communicate and collaborate with their peers. Toward this objective, this paper introduces and formalizes the concept of Social Participation Network, which captures the diverse participation relationships -between people, digital services and connected things -supporting participatory processes. The paper further presents the early design of an associated online service to support the creation and management of Social Participation Networks. The design advocates the instantiation of Social Participation Networks within distinct participation contexts-spanning, e.g., private institutions, neighbor communities, and governmental institutions-so that the participants' information and contributions to participation remain isolated and private within the given context.",

Such digitally-powered participation, known as digital participation [24] , has led to the emergence of various participatory practices that empower people at scale. Illustrative examples include: crowd-sourcing/-funding [14] , participatory budgeting [15] , peer to peer sharing in communities [26] , open government data access & analysis [25] , participatory urban planning [6] , and public consultations [21] . As the \"Ladder of Participation\" illustrates [4] , there exist different levels of involvement of the community in participatory processes, from non-participatory to citizen control, through to, e.g., informing, consultation and partnership. Still, independent of the target level of participation, enabling digital participation requires making it seamless for people to connect and interact with the relevant community of people but also of digital entities (see Fig. 1 ). Indeed, the \"community\" of digital entities is essential to support the implementation of participatory processes in the digital world and even in the physical world by way of the IoT. Toward that direction, this paper introduces the concept of Social Participation Network, which captures the various entities that may potentially engage in a given digital participatory process, while abstracting the underlying heterogeneity.",

We also introduce the rules that govern the emergence of relationships among the participating entities within a network to enhance the associated participatory process, while enforcing privacy and security guarantees to participants. We then present the early design of an online service -introducing its architecture and component technologies -supporting the implementation of participatory processes based on the proposed concept of Social Participation Network (Sect. 4). Finally, we conclude with a summary of our contribution and the research challenges ahead of us (Sect. 5).",

Open data is among the pioneer implementation of open government in today's digital era. Still, there exist various implementations of the concept [16] , which differ according to the level of participation, from the citizen being a mere consumer to an actor, of the government actions. Accordingly, a number of software tools support the open data movement, from the management of data to engaging developers in the creation of new applications as Open Government Data as a Service illustrates [20] . The proper organization of the exposed data is in particular essential to avoid misinterpretations and requires appropriate visualization tools. Still in the direction of leveraging digital technologies for opening up government knowledge and practices, agencies have applied crowdsourcing to foster civic participation at a massive scale for top-down politics, reform discussion and e-voting. Examples are many and include: the constitution reform in Iceland [17] , open ministry in Finland [8] and open innovation strategies [7] . According to Aitamurto [1] , crowdsourcing with co-creation constitutes the main method for realizing participatory democracy.",

The supporting software platforms then cope with: sensing and data collection, analyzing the data, and combining the physical with the virtual environments (i.e., social networking and sensor data integration). As such, the software solutions involve a large diversity of systems, spanning: mobile computing, cyber-physical, and Artificial Intelligence, to name a few. The widespread adoption of smartphones and further development of the IoT, allow collecting data that address multiple domains of the smart cities -mobility, health, utilities, etc. -and offer a unique opportunity for participatory applications.

One key feature of the participatory OSNS is to provide interoperability across the heterogeneous cyber entities, including the diverse online communication services people use (from email to popular OSNSes). We have previously introduced the social middleware solution to address such interoperability requirements [2] . In particular, social middleware leverages the Universal Social Network Bus [3] which mediates interaction across online communication technologies to overcome the platform lock-in. Participatory OSNS Architecture: Building on the above contributions and state-of-the-art technology building blocks, Fig. 3 depicts the architecture design of a participatory OSNS. The architecture includes the Event Handler Service as a Node.js (www.nodejs.org) and Express (www.expressjs.com) application. Actors, in a given participatory context, then trigger events such as engagesIn and showsInterestIn, which are published to a message broker such as RabbitMQ (www.rabbitmq.com) (see Publish event in Fig. 3 ). The Event Handler Service consumes events from the message broker (see Consume event in Fig. 3 ), which it evaluates using the Rule Engine and Knowledge Base containing the social participation network rules we presented in Sect. 3.2 (see Event evaluation in Fig. 3 ). The rules are stored in a MongoDB (www.mongodb.com) database as Json documents. If the event evaluation triggers an operation, the social participation network graph structure is updated accordingly (see operation in Fig. 3) , where we leverage the graph-oriented database Neo4j (www.neo4j.com), to store the social participation network graph. Finally, actors receive an updated version of the social participation network graph that concerns them (see Publish update and Consume update in Fig. 3 ).",

However, the possibility of gathering unprecedented amount of information can endanger the privacy of people. This is a threat that participatory technologies share with the more global paradigm of smart cities [18] and, in general, with any online activity [11] . A base requirement is for any participatory service/platform to enforce the isolation of the diverse participation contexts (e.g., consultation within an enterprise, participatory budgeting campaign, neighborhood co-creation initiatives, ...). Figure 4 illustrates the isolation of participatory processes. The social participation network graph and its associated data hosted by a Town Hall is distinct and isolated from the one hosted by a group of neighbors and by a private institution. The Town Hall hosts two instances for two participatory contexts, which can have different participants and relations among them. The main goal is to protect information such as who are the participants, their personal and private data and their participation contributions. This example shows the two main levels of participatory process isolation: 1. Service provider-level : The isolation is at the level of the party -or consortiuminterested in setting up the participatory process. The interested parties act as service providers, as they host an OSNS for the participation instance -or are responsible for finding an appropriate host-. 2. Participatory context-level : The isolation is at the level of participants contributions and interactions. All information remains isolated among different participatory contexts even within the same service provider.",

In a nutshell, the introduced relationships allow automating the finding of: potential collaborators by commonality of interests, participatory actions, and relevant information coming from digital services. We have presented an early formalization of the rules allowing the creation and management of a Social Participation Network together with the architecture design of an associated Participatory Online Social Network Service. Moreover, we recommend the instantiation of social participation networks within distinct participation contexts-spanning, e.g., private institutions, neighbor communities, and governmental institutions-to protect personal data and privacy given the diverse, and maybe sensitive, participatory contexts. The work we presented here is preliminary and there are still open questions regarding the conceptualisation and implementation of Social Participation Networks. As part of our ongoing and future work, we are developing key technical aspects of our architecture design, such as the integration of heterogeneous IoT devices and software services, as part of the extension of the Universal Social Network Bus [3] . We are also studying the definition of additional social participation network rules to automatically learn and adapt the embedded participatory links. We also plan to evaluate our work both by simulations of participatory contexts and by running small real use cases. Finally, it is crucial to address key challenges facing digital participation, such as the digital divide since not everyone has Internet access and/or is digital literate, and improving the level of engagement by supporting the right participation incentives.",
