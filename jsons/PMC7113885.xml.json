Its vast potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent, defined through in vitro and in vivo studies, lends hope for its clinical use against various infectious diseases that are at present not therapeutically controlled. However, evidence for beneficial effects in humans, especially in the perspective of long-term administration in chronic diseases, remains equivocal. This could be attributable to a relative lack of standardized animal studies and controlled clinical trials in healthy and infected subjects. In addition to influenza and pathogenic human respiratory viruses, ARB shows mainly in vitro inhibitory activity against the hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), reovirus, Hantaan virus and coxsackie virus B5.",

Studies have also been conducted in children suffering from flu and other acute viral respiratory diseases (Beliaev et al., 1996, Drinevski\u012d et al., 1998). The latter study \u2013 and most documented one \u2013 was conducted on 158 children of 1\u201314 years old, infected with influenza A or B or both or with other respiratory viruses. Over a 5-day treatment, ARB was efficient at reducing the duration of infection and the occurrence of complications, and its immunomodulating action was again suggested. In 2002, Masterlek\u2122, the company currently marketing ARB, sponsored a vast clinical trial conducted on 500 children from 6 to over 12 years old. ARB was given (i) either in prophylaxis twice a week for 3 weeks or once daily for 12 days; (ii) or in treatment thrice daily for 3 days. In all cases, ARB treatment led to a significant reduction of the duration of clinical signs, with no observed adverse effect or complications; see:\nhttp://arbidol.org/arbidol-childrens-study.pdf.\n",

On long-term per os administration of ARB in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits or dogs from 2 to over 6 months (with doses ranging from 25 to 125 mg/kg), no pathological changes were observed in animals. These doses would roughly correspond to 10- to 50-fold the therapeutic doses in humans.",

However doses administered differed, and technological improvements, especially in detection sensitivity, might also explain such discrepancies. Single doses of 200 mg of ARB administered to healthy volunteers from dispersible tablets or capsules were found bioequivalent and well tolerated (Liu et al., 2009). Pharmacokinetics of oral single vs multiple doses of ARB were compared in healthy subjects, from plasma samples analyzed by HPLC (Metz et al., 1998, Sun et al., 2013). C\nmax increased linearly with the intake dose for single dose administrations, peaking at 2.16 \u03bcg/ml for a 800 mg-dose (Sun et al., 2013).

Conversely, ARB was found to inhibit UGT1A9 (ibid.; Liu et al., 2013). Since UGT1A9 is involved in the metabolism of several drugs (e.g. acetominophen, diclofenac), potential drug-drug interactions that could lead to adverse effects should be carefully examined if ARB is administered with other molecules. A more complete picture could be obtained from a study in healthy volunteers receiving a single oral dose of 200 mg ARB, where urine, feces and plasma metabolites were analyzed (Deng et al., 2013). Most of the metabolites were sulfoxidated, dimethylamine N-demethylated, glucuronide- or sulfate-conjugated. About 32.4% of the total intake dose of ARB was excreted unchanged via feces, as previously reported (Boriskin et al., 2008). Sulfinyl-ARB (Fig. 1B) was the major circulating component detected in plasma, followed by unmetabolized ARB, N-demethyl-sulfinyl-ARB and sulfonyl-ARB (Fig. 1C). Urine samples contained mainly glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. In vitro experiments using human liver, intestine and kidney microsomes, and recombinant enzymes, showed that ARB was metabolized by human microsomes from liver and intestines but not from kidney.

Plasma elimination half-lives (t\n1/2) of all metabolites were longer than that of ARB (26.3, 25, 25.7 and 15.7 h for N-demethylated, sulfinyl-, sulfonyl-ARB and ARB, respectively). Exposure to metabolites is therefore greater than that to ARB, and the main metabolite, sulfinyl-ARB, is expected to accumulate on repeated ARB doses. Along these lines, sulfinyl-ARB was reported to contribute for some of the pharmacological activities associated with ARB, and sulfonyl-ARB could inhibit protein kinase C ([IC50] = 7.78 \u03bcM) (Demin et al., 2010).

This could explain why ARB demonstrated greater efficacy under pre-incubation conditions, where metabolites could already be produced and exert specific effects (see below Section 4.). However, a recent study directly addressing the in vitro antiviral properties of sulfinyl- and sulfonyl-ARB against the Chikungunya alphavirus showed only moderate to weak activity as compared to that of the parent molecule (Delogu et al., 2011). This was reinforced by the observation that pre-incubation of cells with ARB prior to infection did not improve antiviral effect, pointing to a minor role (if any) of ARB metabolites against Chikungunya infection, at least in vitro. In any case, further investigations will be necessary to: (i) understand the importance of metabolites in the efficacy and safety of ARB, due to their high plasma exposure and long elimination half-lives; (ii) assess their stability in circulation, tissue binding and storage properties.",

In vitro studies report IC50s in the 2.5\u201316 \u03bcM range, and state an effect of ARB comparable to that of ribavirin, but superior to that of rimantadine, with rimantadine-resistant strains sensitive to ARB (Burtseva et al., 2007, Romanovskaia et al., 2009, Leneva et al., 2010, Fediakina et al., 2011). A few studies state a potentiating effect of ARB and rimantadine (or amantadine) on influenza A and B viruses (Leneva et al., 2005, Burtseva et al., 2007). However adamantane antivirals are scarcely used against influenza viruses, due to low barrier to resistance. In these studies, accessible information does not allow to evaluate the stage of the viral life cycle targeted by ARB nor its mode of action. Shi and coworkers showed a greater inhibitory effect on influenza A H1N1 when ARB was added before infection or when it was pre-incubated with the virus (Shi et al., 2007), suggesting that membrane impregnation and/or metabolites could underlie ARB antiviral activity (see Section 6.). ARB demonstrated similar in vitro antiviral activity as the reference drug ribavirin (Virazole\u00ae) against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an enveloped virus of the Paramyxoviridae family (Leneva et al., 2002). ARB was most efficient when added before infection (Shi et al., 2007), with an IC50 of 16 \u03bcM.",

Concerning RSV, only a reduction in plaque size and not in number could be observed, hampering the estimation of an IC50. In this study, ARB was added to cells as an aqueous glycerol solution, instead of the classical dilution from DMSO in other studies (Leneva et al., 2002, Shi et al., 2007).

In vitro, ARB was more efficient when added before infection, with an IC50 in the 2 \u03bcM range. A direct virucidal effect was noted only for ARB concentrations over 15 \u03bcM. In vivo, it was able to increase the survival rate, reduce histopathological changes and viral loads in the lethal model of intracranially-infected suckling mice. Also, serum levels of TNF-alpha were modulated. Since these studies were performed by only one research group, with a limited number of animals, they should be reproduced by others before concluding to a beneficial effect of ARB against hantavirus infection.

This virus is a prototypic member of the Orthoreovirus genus, which infects a wide variety of host species without causing a significant pathology in humans. In spite of this, reovirus has proven to be a useful model for studying viral pathogenesis. In vitro, ARB inhibited reovirus infection in the 10 \u03bcM range, but interestingly, did not exert any effect on infectious subvirion particles (ISVPs), intermediates of reovirus infection (Chandran et al., 2002) that could also directly infect cells via a different entry mechanism from that of reovirus (Martinez et al., 1996). This points to the molecular mechanisms of action of ARB (detailed in Section 6.).",

ARB did not show virucidal activity, contrary to data on respiratory viruses (Shi et al., 2007, Zhong et al., 2009), and displayed the highest efficiency when preincubated with cells 24 h before infection (IC50 \u223c 7.5 \u03bcM). In this study, the main metabolites sulfinyl- and sulfonyl-ARB were assayed and exhibited only weak antiviral activity, with IC50s > 55 \u03bcM. ARB activity was not improved when a 12 h-preincubation with cells was performed, suggesting that metabolites or degradation products are not responsible for ARB antiviral action.

For a number of viruses, in particular in the Flaviviridae family, replication occurs in a subcellular compartment called the membranous web (Heaton and Randall, 2011, Moradpour et al., 2007). The membranous web is an emanation of the endoplasmic reticulum induced by viral proteins such as HCV NS4B (Gouttenoire et al., 2010, Romero-Brey et al., 2012). Since the web is created and maintained through interactions between viral and cellular proteins and lipids, it is plausible that ARB could impair viral replication through its ability to bind proteins and lipids. Concerning viral assembly and budding, intracellular membranes are obligate partners of nucleocapsids during packaging of enveloped viruses, and for the secretion of newly assembled viral particles. In the case of HCV, viral assembly is concomitant to the assembly of lipoproteins, giving rise to lipo-viro particles (Bartenschlager et al., 2011). ARB could therefore interfere with these processes through its physico-chemical dual interactions with lipids and proteins.",

First, ARB was found to drastically impede virion attachment to cell plasma membrane. ARB subsequently impaired the release of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) from the plasma membrane, resulting in a slowing of clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) intracellular trafficking. The net result was an intracellular accumulation of CCVs containing trapped virions. ARB was also shown to affect clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) by impeding dynamin-2-induced membrane scission, and thereby CCP formation. Lastly, ARB inhibited fusion between endocytic vesicles and endosomes and hindered viral intracellular trafficking. Virions were not properly delivered to Rab5-positive endosomal compartments where fusion occurs and/or Rab5 was not recruited to virion-containing vesicles. As a result, fusion was greatly impaired and virions trafficked to endo-lysosomal Lamp-1-positive compartments for degradation.",

In vitro studies showed that ARB increases the stability of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and hinders low pH structural reorganizations necessary for HA to adopt its fusiogenic conformation, thus blocking infection at the viral fusion step (Leneva et al., 2009; see also below Section 7.). Concerning HCV, fusion inhibition is dose-dependent but does not depend on the HCV genotype or on the lipid composition of target membranes (liposomes); it predominantly prevails at low pH (Boriskin et al., 2006, Haid et al., 2009, P\u00e9cheur et al., 2007, Teissier et al., 2011). ARB was found to directly interact with peptides from the HCV E2 glycoprotein (Teissier et al., 2011) and within a pocket of the influenza HA2 subunit of hemagglutinin (Nasser et al., 2013), thereby exerting its effect as a DAA. Interestingly, these peptides and pocket contain aromatic residues such as tyrosines and tryptophans, which could engage in aromatic stacking interactions with ARB molecules, as described above. ARB may therefore inhibit fusion by impairing conformational changes in viral fusion proteins during initiation of fusion (DAA activity) and by increasing membrane rigidity, rendering membranes refractory to the destabilization that is required for fusion (HTA activity).",

These vacuoles consist in vesicles of 0.6\u20132.0 \u03bcm in diameter harboring numerous spherules (Grimley et al., 1968), which are positive for lysosomal markers (Kujala et al., 2001).

In a study aimed at understanding the anti-influenza mechanism of action of ARB, Leneva and colleagues isolated seven viral mutants from the influenza A/H7N7 \u201cWeybridge\u201d strain, that were refractory to ARB doses above 38 \u03bcM (Leneva et al., 2009). All mutants exhibited a single mutation in the HA2 subunit of the influenza hemagglutinin, the subunit involved in membrane fusion. This translated functionally into a 0.2-unit increase in the pH required to induce HA2 conformational changes. ARB was found to directly interact with HA2, thereby increasing its stability to pH and impeding fusion in endosomes during virus infection. Using an elegant proteomic approach, this interaction was further investigated by Nasser and coworkers, and found confined to one peptide encompassing HA2 residues 104\u2013120. This region contains the ARB already identified mutation resistance K117R (Leneva et al., 2009, Nasser et al., 2013). Taken together, these data reveal that resistance of influenza viruses to ARB mainly arises from mutations in the HA2 fusion protein, consistent with ARB antiviral activity related to membrane fusion.",

This virus was characterized by a single mutation in the E2 viral envelope glycoprotein, in a region most likely involved in cell-surface receptor recognition, and maybe indirectly to membrane fusion. Clearly, additional studies on ARB resistance in the context of other viral infections are warranted.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the broad-spectrum activity of ARB may arise through duality of function: a capacity to interact with both membranes and with viral and/or cellular proteins. ARB therefore has features of both a DAA and a HTA. These interactions would impede cellular processes and pathways that are hijacked by several viruses to infect their host cells. Regarding HCV, we have shown that ARB inhibits most steps of HCV entry, from attachment to internalization, until the final step of membrane fusion. ARB also inhibits HCV replication, which may arise via alteration of intracellular membrane-protein structures essential for intracellular trafficking (e.g. clathrin coat components, elements of the cytoskeleton) and virus replication (e.g. membranous web), and could hinder membrane rearrangements necessary for the viral budding step. The broad-spectrum activity and the cellular mechanisms affected by ARB are summarized in Fig. 2. Through these effects, ARB could display an antiviral activity on viruses that hijack similar cellular pathways or have overlapping life cycles. In particular, endocytosis is used by several viruses and viral families including human immunodeficiency virus (von Kleist et al., 2011), Adenoviridae, Arenaviridae, Coronaviridae, Togaviridae to achieve productive infection (Table 1). Moreover, all positive-strand RNA viruses of eukaryotes are known to reorganize intracellular membranes to create specific virus replication organelles. For these reasons, efforts should be pursued in order to determine the potential inhibitory effect of ARB on a large class of viruses. A better understanding of its molecular mechanisms of action would also contribute to refine the conditions at which it could be given in long-term regimens against chronic infections (e.g. hepatitis B or C). Indeed current data on toxicity issues are insufficient to evaluate the safety of ARB in chronic administration. Nevertheless, most studies point to a good tolerability of this molecule. In the present state of our knowledge, ARB could therefore constitute a cost-effective pharmacological approach, affordable for emerging countries in urgent need for effective antiviral therapies.",
