Two of the manuscripts presented in this Issue established, in distinct Northern European populations, two novel Se-related biomarkers of risk and prognosis for CVD. Schomburg et al. identified, in a Swedish human perspective cohort, a strong correlation between low baseline plasma levels of Selenoprotein P (SELENOP; the major Se-transporter) and risk for all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, and a first CVD event during the follow-up period of 9.3 (8.3-11) years [2] . Based on the known high prevalence (20%) of low SELENOP levels in the Northern European population [2, 3] , these data suggest that plasma SELENOP concentrations may be used as an early biomarker of CVD risk and, therefore, that targeted Se supplementation could be used as a preventative measure. However, further studies are required to determine the causal link between SELENOP levels and cardiovascular events and to assess whether genetic variants in the SELENOP gene, known to influence Se bioavailability, affects this correlation.",

In a distinct cohort of 75 German patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, a marked but transient increase in circulating SELENBP1 concentrations during the surgical process was correlated, in most patients, with the duration of ischemia and myocardial damage. This suggests that serum concentrations of SELENBP1 could constitute a quantitative marker for myocardial hypoxia [1] .

Scly is responsible for the breakdown of intracellular selenocysteine to alanine and selenide, which is in turn recycled for the synthesis of new selenoproteins. The conditional Scly knockout (KO) model affecting agouti-related peptide-positive neurons in the hypothalamus (Scly-Agrp KO mice) displayed a reduction in high fat diet-induced weight gain and protection against development of leptin resistance compared with controls (mice expressing Scly). This was linked to progressive degeneration of some Agrp neurons and in brown adipose tissue pattern [7] .",

The study examined over 1000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 154 genes within the Se biological pathway (including all selenoprotein genes and Se metabolic pathway genes) and interactions with serum Se status biomarkers from the previous study. The findings provide the most comprehensive evidence to date that individual genotypes relevant for selenoprotein expression, metabolism, and function and interaction with Se status may affect CRC risk in a population of marginally low Se status, such as in Europe. Pathway analyses indicated that, for genes in antioxidant/redox and apoptotic pathways, the influence of SNPs on the disease risk is also dependent on interaction with Se status [3] .",

Several selenoproteins (including biological stress response and Se biosynthesis genes) were differentially expressed in the disease tissue compared to the normal tissue of both CRA and CRC patients, and that also showed tumour gene expression changes correlated to levels of Se or SELENOP. Across the disease tissues from the adenoma and both cancer groups, GPX2 and TXNRD3 exhibited higher expression while GPX3, SELENOP, SELENOS, and SEPHS2 showed lower expression. The authors concluded that selenoprotein expression changes could be used as biomarkers of functional Se status and the colorectal adenoma to cancer transition. In survival analyses, only a higher SELENOF expression was associated with poorer survival outcomes after cancer diagnosis. Although this did not retain significance after multiple testing correction, there is possible biological validity to this observation as SELENOF has been previously linked with oncogenesis [6] .",

The authors showed that Selol could be an efficient source of Se for selenoprotein biosynthesis in immortalized kidney (HEK293) and prostate cancer (LNCaP) cell lines but not in immortalized prostate cells (PNT1A,) possibly due to variance in lipid metabolism between the different cell lines [8] .

During viral infection, the pathogens induce oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species and by altering the cellular antioxidant defences, including selenoproteins such as glutathione peroxidases (GPx) and thioredoxin reductases. Consequently, the host's Se requirements increase and, in hosts deficient in Se, the oxidative stress can induce viral genome mutations, leading to increased microbial virulence (e.g., coxsackie and influenza viruses). Other mechanisms by which the host's nutritional status can affect viral infection progression include reducing the ability of the immune system to respond to the virus (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C and B viruses). In silico data have also revealed the presence of selenoprotein genes in the genomes of several common viruses (e.g., HIV) that resemble mammalian GPx. The function and regulation of such viral selenoproteins remains unclear but could afford viruses protection from oxidative damage [10] .",

In a timely review, Ren et al. discuss the current knowledge on ER-resident SELENOF, including its function and role in ER stress response and the regulation of its expression [9] . The review also summarises results from genetic association studies linking genotypes for SNPs in the SELENOF gene to risk for various cancers, Kashin-Beck disease, and AIDs progression, with a particular focus on two well-characterised functional SNPs (rs5845 and rs5859) affecting SELENOF protein expression. Furthermore, the authors discuss the dysregulation of SELENOF expression in several tissue and pathologies, from cancer to neurodegeneration and immune system diseases [9] . Future studies investigating the role of other ER-resident selenoproteins could lead to a better understanding of mechanisms that contribute to the development of a wide range of common complex diseases.",

Detailed investigation of Se intake levels and metabolism is needed to more fully elucidate the relevance for disease etiopathogenesis, especially for populations with diverse Se status levels and/or individuals with potentially at-risk disease or protective Se pathway genotypes.
