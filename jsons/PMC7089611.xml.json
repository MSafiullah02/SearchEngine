Although HCoV-229E infections are generally mild, more severe upper and lower respiratory tract infections, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia, have been well documented, particularly in infants, elderly individuals, and immunocompromised patients [1], [3], [4]. There have also been reports that clusters of HCoV-229E infections cause pneumonia in otherwise healthy adults [2], [5]. Several emerging human coronaviruses have recently been discovered [6], [7], [8]. Between 2003 and 2004, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013CoV caused a worldwide epidemic and had a significant economic impact in the countries where the disease outbreak occurred [8]. Phylogenetic analyses have shown that SARS\u2013CoV is closely related to the sequences of the betacoronaviruses [9]. In 2004, another alphacoronavirus (HCoV-NL63) was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis [7]. In 2005, Woo et al. described the discovery of a novel betacoronavirus, HKU1, which was found in patients with respiratory tract infections [10].",

            "text": "CoV particles have an irregular shape that consists of an outer envelope with distinctive, \u2018club-shaped\u2019 peplomers, giving the virus a crown (corona) appearance [11]. The viral genome of coronaviruses consists of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of approximately 30 kb, and it contains several genes encoding several structural and non-structural proteins that are required for progeny virion production [1]. The virion envelope surrounding the nucleocapsid contains the following structural proteins: S (spike) protein, M (membrane), E (envelope), and N (nucleocapsid). Some variants have a third glycoprotein, HE (hemagglutinin-esterase), which is present in most betacoronaviruses [12], [13]. A helical nucleocapsid exists in the center of the viral particle [14], [15], [16]. Nucleocapsid protein, the major structural protein of CoVs, binds the viral RNA genome to form the virion core, leading to the formation of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex or to a long helical nucleocapsid structure [17], [18]. The formation of the RNP is important for maintaining the RNA in an ordered conformation suitable for replication and transcription of the viral genome [17], [19], [20], [21]. Previous studies have shown that the CoV N protein is involved in the regulation of cellular processes, such as gene transcription, actin reorganization, host cell cycle progression, and apoptosis [22], [23], [24], [25]. The CoV N protein has also been shown to act as an RNA chaperone [26]. Moreover, the N protein is an important diagnostic marker and immunodominant antigen in host immune responses [21], [27], [28].",

            "text": "The N protein of HCoV-229E, which has a molecular weight of 50 kDa, is highly basic (pI, 10.0), and it shows strong hydrophilicity [29]. The HCoV-229E N protein has 26\u201330% sequence homology with CoV N proteins from other strains or viruses, such as HCoV-OC43 and SARS [30]. Despite their low sequence homology, CoV N proteins from different strains can show a high level of conservation in some motifs [30]. Chang et al. reported results from an order\u2013disorder prediction and secondary structure prediction coupled with sequence alignment, which suggested that all CoV N proteins share the same modular organization [31]. Self-association of the N protein is an important step in virus particle assembly for many CoVs [32]. Previous studies have shown that full-length CoV N proteins can form high-order oligomers, and the C-terminal domains of the CoV N proteins are responsible for oligomerization [30], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38]. Crystal structures of the C-terminal domains of CoV N proteins have been published and suggest that the basic building block for coronavirus nucleocapsid formation is the dimeric assembly of the N protein [34], [39], [40], [41]. Luo et al. revealed that the CoV N protein might combine with viral genomic RNA to generate higher-order oligomers, which could trigger the formation of the long nucleocapsid structure [32]. However, the oligomerization mechanism of the C-terminal domain of the HCoV-229E N protein remains unclear. The C-terminal tail has been found to participate in the oligomerization of the SARS\u2013CoV N protein since the removal of 40 aa from the C-terminus apparently decreased the ability of the protein to oligomerize [32]. The extreme C-terminal tail of the HCoV N protein was labeled as a separate functional domain [42]. We speculate that the C-terminal tail might constitute an important molecular determinant of oligomerization for HCoV-229E NP. However, the recombinant full-length nucleocapsid N protein of the coronavirus is highly sensitive to proteolysis and aggregation that is difficult to analyze its oligomerization properties [21]. A comprehensive series of HCoV-229E N protein mutants with truncated C-terminal domains was generated based on the PrDOS prediction to clarify the role of the C-terminal tail of the HCoV-229E N protein in oligomerization (Fig. 1\n). According to the order\u2013disorder profiles obtained from the protein disorder prediction system (PrDOS), the predicted structure of HCoV-229 N protein contains one long ordered region (N245\u2013350) located in the C-terminal domain followed by three short regions predicted to be disordered (N351\u2013370), ordered (N371\u2013382), and disordered (N383\u2013389) (Fig. 1) [30]. These truncations were systematically investigated by various biophysical and biochemical analyses. Understanding this mechanism would provide insight into the viral assembly process and could identify additional targets for drugs to combat CoVs through the disruption of N protein self-association.",

To generate the truncated forms of the recombinant N proteins, the N protein gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the plasmid pGENT using various primers. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and XhoI, and the DNA fragments were cloned into pET21b (Novagen) using T4 ligase (NEB). The induction of protein expression was initiated by adding IPTG to 1 mM followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 6  h. After harvesting the bacteria by centrifugation (6000 rpm, 30 min, 4 \u00b0C), the bacterial cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mM NaCl, and 15 mM imidazole). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 \u00b0C) to obtain soluble proteins. The truncated C-terminal domains of the N protein with an C-terminal His6-tag were purified using a Ni\u2013NTA column (Novagen) with an elution gradient from 15 to 250 mM imidazole in the buffer solution. The fractions containing the target proteins were collected and dialyzed against a low-salt buffer.",

The self-association mechanism of the full-length HCoV-229E N protein has been previously reported [21], [47]. To determine whether the C-terminal tail region (N351\u2013389) plays an important role in the oligomerization of the C-terminal domain of the HCoV-229E N protein, the oligomerization of several regions of the C-terminal domain of the N protein were analyzed using analytical ultracentrifugation. The differences in the size distributions among these truncated N proteins were analyzed by sedimentation velocity experiments, and the dimer\u2013tetramer dissociation constant (K\nd,24) for each was determined. The dimer\u2013tetramer dissociation constant (Kd,24) reflects the affinity between two N protein dimers, with smaller numbers representing a higher tendency to oligomerize into tetramers. The truncated N245\u2013350 protein predominantly displays a dimeric quaternary structure with a small amount of tetramers (Fig. 2\nA), exhibiting a K\nd,24 value of 256 \u03bcM. With an extended C-terminal tail that includes residue 370 or residue 376, the respective truncated N245\u2013370 and N245\u2013376 proteins also exist as dimers in solution with the major peaks exhibiting K\nd,24 values of 177 and 159 \u03bcM, respectively (Fig. 2B and C). With an extended C-terminal tail that includes residue 382 or residue 389, the respective truncated N245\u2013382 and N245\u2013389 proteins demonstrated significant shifts in the equilibrium from dimers to tetramers and octamers, with significant decreases in the K\nd,24 values (3.83 and 3.50 \u03bcM, respectively) (Fig. 3\nA and B).

As shown in Fig. 4\nA, the CD spectra of these truncated C-terminal domains of the HCoV-229E N protein were scanned from 190 to 250 nm at 25 \u00b0C. The CD spectrum of N245\u2013350 showed well-structured domains with \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-sheet secondary structures as well as two negative peaks at approximately 205 and 220 nm, respectively. The CD spectra of N245\u2013370, N245\u2013376, N245\u2013382, and N245\u2013389, which contain extended C-terminal tails, showed increased intensities at approximately 205 and 220 nm, suggesting that they possessed a different secondary structure composition compared to N245\u2013350. These CD spectra were further analyzed by the CDPro software to determine the quantitative percentages of the secondary structure (Table 1\n). N245\u2013350 contains approximately 51% \u03b1-helices, 22% \u03b2-sheets, 12% turns, and 15% random coils at 25 \u00b0C. With an extended C-terminal tail that includes residue 370, N245\u2013370 showed a significant increase in undefined structural content with 14% turns and 17% random coils, consistent with the PrDOS prediction indicating that residues 351\u2013370 are predicted to be disordered. Compared to N245\u2013350, N245\u2013370, and N245\u2013376, N245\u2013382 and N245\u2013389 showed significant increases in the \u03b2-sheet content because they may contain an ordered region in their C-terminal tail as predicted by the PrDOS prediction.",

To explore whether a C-terminal tail peptide (residues 377\u2013389) can compete with the oligomerization site of the C-terminal domain of the HCoV-229E N protein and interfere with its oligomerization, we synthesized a C-terminal tail peptide (N377\u2013389) and characterized the binding between N245\u2013389 and this C-terminal tail peptide. First, we utilized fluorescence to monitor the protein/peptide binding because N245\u2013389 contains one tryptophan residue, which contributes to its intrinsic fluorescence. The fluorescence emission spectra for N245\u2013389 showed the maximal emission wavelength at approximately 332 nm with a fluorescence intensity of 142.4 AU (Fig. 5\nA). At the C-terminal tail peptide concentrations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 75 and 100 \u03bcM, the C-terminal tail peptide decreased the fluorescence intensity of N245\u2013389 at approximately 332 nm by 8.7, 19, 23.5, 25.4, 26.9 and 28.9 AU, respectively, after 4 h of peptide addition. The N245\u2013389 fluorescence decreased with increasing concentrations of the C-terminal tail peptide, which suggests that this decrease reflected the interaction of N245\u2013389 with the C-terminal tail peptide. As shown in Fig. 5B, the fluorescence quenching of N245\u2013389 by the C-terminal tail peptide was analyzed with a Hill plot after the addition of the peptide. The dissociation constant of the C-terminal tail peptide for N245\u2013389 was calculated to be 7.43 \u03bcM.",

Sedimentation velocity (SV) experiments with increasing concentrations of the C-terminal tail peptide were performed, and the data were globally fit to determine the dimer\u2013tetramer dissociation constant of N245\u2013389. Fig. 6\nshows the distribution plots of the N245\u2013389 protein in the absence and presence of the C-terminal tail peptide. In the absence of the C-terminal tail peptide, N245\u2013389 formed a stable dimer, tetramer, and octamer with S-values of approximately 2.85, 5.30 and 7.75, respectively, corresponding to the molecular masses of 31, 69, and 131 kDa, respectively. When the concentrations of the C-terminal tail peptide were increased, the N245\u2013389 tetramer and octamer peak decreased, whereas the N245\u2013389 dimer peak increased (Fig. 6). When the molar ratio of N245\u2013389/N377\u2013389 was 0.25 and 0.1, the K\nd,24 value for N245\u2013389 was approximately 6.1 and 9.7 \u03bcM, respectively, and it is significantly higher than that of N245\u2013389 in the absence of the C-terminal tail peptide. These results indicate that the N245\u2013389 tetramer and octamer was significantly dissociated into dimers in the presence of the peptide (N377\u2013389) and suggest that the C-terminal tail peptide may complete the tetramer interface of N245\u2013389 and interfere with the oligomerization of N245\u2013389. We further analyze the effects of the peptide, N377\u2013389, on the cell viability and viral titre of HCoV-229E. The results showed that the cell viability was not affected by treatment with N377\u2013389 alone (300 \u03bcM) for 24 h in A549 cell lines (Fig. S2A). In addition, viral titre of HCoV-229E was inhibited by N377\u2013389 at 300 \u03bcM, significantly (Fig. S2B).",

These oligomers exist predominantly as dimers [47], [48]. The secondary structure alignment of the C-terminal domains from the HCoV-229E N protein with the corresponding proteins from SARS\u2013CoV and IBV indicates that these proteins share very similar secondary structure profiles [49]. The crystal structures of the C-terminal domains of SARS\u2013CoV, IBV, and MHV N proteins show a similar general polypeptide fold, which strongly suggests that the dimerized N protein is the functional unit in vivo for the four groups of coronaviruses [35], [39]. The crystal structure of the C-terminal domain shows a tightly intertwined twofold symmetric C-terminal domain dimer, with a \u03b2-hairpin (\u03b21 and \u03b22) from one subunit extending into the cavity of the opposite subunit, which forms an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet with hydrogen bonds occurring across the dimer interface [39]. Chang et al. proposed that all coronaviruses employ the same interface mechanism for the dimerization of the N protein [48]. Based on the crystal structures of the N proteins from SARS\u2013CoV, MHV, and IBV, the dimeric C-terminal structural domain of the HCoV-229E N protein has been mapped to N245\u2013350. Here, analytical ultracentrifugation analysis consistently shows that the dimer appears to be the functional unit for the C-terminal domain of the HCoV-229E N protein. The dimeric N245\u2013350 self-associates into a small amount of tetramers. A crosslinking assay was also conducted to investigate oligomerization by the C-terminal domain of the N protein. As shown in Fig. S3A, the crosslinking studies of N245\u2013350 also detected dimers and tetramers.",

Compared to N245\u2013350, the crosslinking results showed that N245\u2013389 forms dimers and tetramers as well as high-order oligomers (Fig. S3B). The analytical ultracentrifugation results were consistent with that of the chemical crosslinking analysis. Our results demonstrate that the C-terminal tail plays a crucial role in N protein oligomerization. According to the PrDOS prediction, the C-terminal tail (N351\u2013389) is composed of disordered (N351\u2013370), ordered (N371\u2013382), and disordered (N383\u2013389) regions. The truncations of the C-terminal domain of the HCoV-229E N protein, N245\u2013370 and N245\u2013376, which contain the first disordered region of the C-terminal tail display a predominantly dimeric quaternary structure with a small amount of tetramers and high-order oligomers and exhibit K\nd,24 values of 177 and 159 \u03bcM, respectively. Interestingly, when the dimeric C-terminal structural domain of the HCoV-229E N protein includes the C-terminal tail to either residue 382 or 389, containing the short ordered region, the respective proteins, N245\u2013382 and N245\u2013389, demonstrated equilibrium shifts toward tetramers and octamers, indicating that the last 13 residues of the C-terminal tail may play an important role in dimer\u2013dimer association. A computer-assisted prediction of the secondary structure based on the amino acid sequence predicted a short \u03b2-strand at the end of the C-terminal tail (Fig. S4), which is consistent with the CD results that showed that N245\u2013382 and N245\u2013389 contain higher \u03b2-sheet content compared to the other C-terminal domain truncations of the HCoV-229E N protein. Therefore, we speculate that the hydrogen bonds across the tetramer interface formed by the main chain atoms of the short \u03b2-strand may stabilize the oligomerization of the C-terminal domain of the N protein through domain-swapping (Fig. 7\n).",

In this report, N245\u2013382 and N245\u2013389 show a very high degree of stability compared to the other C-terminal domain truncations of the HCoV-229E N protein due to a high degree of subunit interactions. The inhibition of viral N protein oligomerization by developing competing peptides and small organic compounds is an attractive therapeutic strategy against viral infection [53], [54], [55]. We showed that a peptide based on the C-terminal tail interfered with the oligomerization of the C-terminal domain of the HCoV-229E N protein, N245\u2013389 and performed the inhibitory effect on viral titre of HCoV-229E.
