            "text": "Schistosomiasis is a debilitating parasitic disease which affects 78 countries worldwide. This disease leads to approximately 200,000 deaths annually and severely compromises the life quality from those affected. Among causative species, Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma japonicum, and Schistosoma mansoni stand out as those of major importance to human health (1\u20133). Infection occurs through the direct contact of the host with the parasite\u2019s larval form. After parasite penetration and sexual development, egg laying begins. The release of eggs in the feces and its hatching in the environment closes the parasite\u2019s life cycle (4). However, a significant amount of these eggs is trapped in some of the host\u2019s organs, such as liver and intestine, where they induce a granulomatous inflammatory reaction (5, 6). Hepatic granulomatous inflammation arises from the egg-secreted antigens, which perform hepatotoxic and immunological activities capable of recruiting immune cells to the organ and forming periovular granuloma. The composition of the granuloma includes macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, T and B lymphocytes and especially fibroblasts, responsible for the fibrotic characteristic of the structure (7, 8).",

The role of intracellular immune receptors in granuloma formation, for instance, was first described in a seminal study conducted by Ritter and colleagues (9). However, a better understanding of cytosolic sensors during S. mansoni infection is required. These intracellular receptors are those responsible for activating the inflammasome pathway. This pathway induces the formation of an intracellular protein complex typically consisting of Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD), leucine-rich repeat (LRR)- containing protein (NLR) family members, an adapter molecule known as ASC, and the cysteine protease caspase-1 as an effector molecule. Activation of this pathway leads to cleavage of immature forms of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 into their mature forms. It might also induce cell death by pyroptosis. The inflammasome activation takes place in both immune and non-immune cells and is essentially triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and Danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) (10, 11).",

It has been demonstrated that NLRP3 is critical for granuloma formation and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation (18) in S. japonicum infections. Regarding S. mansoni infection this same sensor has been shown to be involved in the adaptive immune response and also granuloma formation (9). Recent studies have reported that NLRP3 and NLRP6 expression are simultaneously modulated in some processes, including those occurring in the liver (19, 20). Additionally, the role of NLRP6 in fibrotic diseases has already been described (21, 22). Thus, we decided to investigate whether the NLRP6 sensor plays a role in the course of S. mansoni infection and liver pathology. In this study, we demonstrate that lack of NLRP6 modulates the formation of hepatic granuloma, influencing local chemokine and cytokine production as well as macrophage and neutrophil recruitment into the liver. Also, this receptor is important for promoting collagen deposition.",

Ritter and colleagues (2010) reported that SEA induces inflammasome activation in DCs and described the involvement of NLRP3 (9). Thus, given the relevance of these cells, we decided to use bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) in order to investigate whether the NLRP6 sensor is involved in IL-1\u03b2 secretion in response to different parasite antigens. Using Pam3Cys (P3Cys) as the first signal, we observed that eggs and their soluble antigens (SEA) induce high levels of IL-1\u03b2 and this production was partially influenced by NLRP6 (Figure 1A). In contrast, IL-1\u03b2 production induced by soluble adult worm antigens (SWAP) was much lower compared to SEA (Figure 1A). Additionally, TNF-\u03b1 levels were not altered comparing both WT and NLRP6 knockout (KO) mice (Figure 1B). Since SEA was sufficient to induce IL-1\u03b2 production, we used this stimulus to evaluate the role of NLRP6 in caspase-1 (casp-1) activation. Figures 1C,D demonstrate that SEA induces activation of casp-1 in WT DCs and this process was clearly inhibited in Nlrp6\u2013/\u2013 DCs.",

Initially, we observed that the number of eggs per gram of tissue was not altered between WT and knockout mice (Figure 2A). Consistently, the worm burden recovery was the same comparing both groups (Supplementary Figure S2). On the other hand, NLRP6 has been shown to influence the periovular inflammatory response, contributing significantly to granuloma formation (Figure 2B). In addition, collagen deposition within the granulomatous structure was reduced in Nlrp6\u2013/\u2013 mice when compared to WT (Figures 2B,C,H). We also evaluated levels of cytokines and fibrotic markers within the tissue, such as the cytokines IL-5, IL-10, IL-13, and the protein Alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). IL-5 and IL-10 cytokines levels, as well as, \u03b1-SMA and IL-13 mRNA measurements were reduced in Nlrp6\u2013/\u2013 group when compared to WT (Figures 2D\u2013G).

In Schistosoma-infected Nlrp6\u2013/\u2013 mice only the production of CCL11 was not reduced in comparison to WT mice (Figure 4D). CCL2, CXCL1, and CCL3 were diminished in Nlrp6\u2013/\u2013 mice compared to WT animals (Figures 4A\u2013C). Additionally, we observed that the enzymes MPO and EPO were also reduced in Nlrp6\u2013/\u2013 mice when compared to WT (Figures 4E,F). Our next step was to evaluate which non-parenchymal cell populations could be altered in Schistosoma-infected Nlrp6\u2013/\u2013 mice. Cells were obtained following the gate strategy described in Supplementary Figure S5. Neutrophils and macrophages were the major cell populations reduced in Nlrp6\u2013/\u2013 mice when compared to WT (Figures 4G,H). The frequency of dendritic cells and CD4+ T lymphocytes remained unaltered in either mouse groups (Figures 4I,J).

Hepatic injuries from different sources are capable of leading to inflammasome activation, as described for drug-induced damage (33), ischemia-reperfusion (34), alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (15, 16), and viral hepatitis (14). Inflammasome triggers or amplify liver diseases by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-1\u03b1, IL-18, and also through other inflammatory mediators such as High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) (35). Release of such cytokines and DAMPs occur, in part, due to Gasdermin-D cleavage and subsequent pyroptosis of the cell (36). The fibrotic process resulting from chronic liver diseases has also involved the inflammasome pathway. IL-1\u03b2 and danger signals induce Hepatic Stellate Cells (HSC) to transdifferentiate and perform extracellular matrix remodeling function. In addition, HSCs can internalize pre-formed inflammasome complexes released by other pyroptosis dying cells (37\u201339).",

After Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) treatment, NAFLD condition improves and the expression of both NLR receptors decreases (20). Besides, a previous study with NAFLD obese patients demonstrates that when hepatic portal fibrosis is present, the expression of NLRP6 mRNA in adipose tissues is higher compared to cases when hepatic portal fibrosis is not observed (21). These findings suggest that NLRP6 might play important role in chronic liver disease and fibrosis. All those findings intrigued us to evaluate the role of this sensor in S. mansoni infection.",

The long survival period of Schistosoma worms within the human host implies recurrent inflammation and wound-healing cycles in the liver, triggered by egg antigens which can result in fibrosis, portal hypertension and hepatosplenomegaly (4, 8). Among non-parenchymal liver cells, DCs stand out as key cells during this pathological process. Broadly responsive to egg antigens, DCs are essential for promoting systemic shift in the immune response profile (from Th1 to Th2), which is crucial for host survival upon infection (28, 40). In addition, the first report of inflammasome pathway activation by S. mansoni antigens involved dendritic cells responding to SEA. For these reasons, we initially decided to evaluate the role of NLRP6 in DCs. Our findings suggest that NLRP6 is important for the formation of the inflammasome complex, since it influences IL-1\u03b2 secretion and caspase-1 activation in response to SEA. Previous studies demonstrate that NLRP6 structurally has the ability to form the inflammasome complex and does so in response to gram-positive bacteria cell wall components, activating both caspase-1 and caspase-11 in the same complex (41, 42).",

Surprisingly, Ritter and colleagues (2010) demonstrated that SEA triggers NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in DCs (9). Following this seminal study, NLRP3 inflammasome role has been investigated, especially in S. japonicum infection. In this context, NLRP3 has been shown to be pivotal for inducing hepatic granuloma formation and collagen deposition in the granulomatous structure (18, 43). In this study, we confirmed that NLRP3 is pivotal for hepatic granuloma formation, but we did not find any alteration in collagen deposition in Nlrp3\u2013/\u2013 mice when compared to WT (Supplementary Figure S7). This observation may be related to the early time point infection of our model (6 weeks), which also could explain the distribution of collagen throughout the granuloma structure and not only peripherally, as typically observed in later granulomas. Surprisingly, we have demonstrated for the first time that NLRP6 also plays an important role in S. mansoni-induced pathology. We found that this sensor influences the formation of hepatic granuloma, altering local chemokine (CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL1) and cytokine (IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13) production, macrophage and neutrophil recruitment into the liver, and also is important for promoting collagen deposition. In Schistosoma egg-induced pathology, chemokine production is essential to modulate granuloma formation (44, 45). CCL3-deficient mice, for instance, showed size reduced granuloma, lower fibrosis and lower EPO activity in the liver (46). Although classically responsible for neutrophil recruitment, CXCL1 also impacts on the recruitment of HSCs, which are responsible for collagen deposition in the granuloma structure (47). Following injury, hepatic resident cells produce CCL2, important for monocyte and macrophage recruitment (48).",

Our findings demonstrate that Casp-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 production, in response to SEA, can be regulated by NLRP6. Therefore, our findings suggest that the role of this receptor in hepatic granuloma formation is due to the inflammasome activation, since Nlrp3\u2013/\u2013 mice have demonstrated a similar phenotype. It is clear that the inflammasome pathway is important for Schistosoma-induced liver pathology, once we have observed granuloma reduction and lower collagen deposition in Casp-1\u2013/\u2013, Gsdmd\u2013/\u2013, and IL-1R\u2013/\u2013 mice when compared to WT. Previous liver disease studies support our observations for Casp-1\u2013/\u2013 and IL-1R\u2013/\u2013 mice. In a high fat diet-induced NASH model, deficient Casp-1 animals showed improvement in hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrogenesis (49). Similarly, IL-1R signaling has been shown to be critical for the progression of steatohepatitis and hepatic fibrosis in hypercholesterolemic mice (50). The role of Gasdermin- D and pyroptosis has also been described in chronic liver diseases (51, 52). During human NAFLD/NASH, GSDMD and its N-terminal peptide (GSDMD-N) are upregulated, besides MCD-fed Gsdmd\u2013/\u2013 mice showed decreased severity of steatosis and inflammation comparing to WT (52). During Schistosoma infection, Liu and colleagues (2019) demonstrated that S. japonicum induces expression of the GSDMD-N in the liver, and that this expression is modulated by NLRP3 sensor (53). In addition, it has been reported that SEA from S. japonicum eggs induces pyroptosis in HSCs (54). However, no in vivo mouse study has been reported correlating GSDMD deficiency and granuloma formation and fibrosis induced by S. mansoni infection as demonstrated here.",
