In South Korea, such problems are projected to become the third leading disease group of disability-adjusted life years among adolescents by 2030 [2]. Psychological problems in this country tend to begin during adolescence (\u226514 years) [1] and are diagnosed at a young age (\u226425 years) [3]. In 2016, 42.4% of adolescents experienced high stress, with suicide being the greatest cause of mortality [4]. Given that suicidal ideation could be an early contributing factor of suicide attempts [5], an urgent investigation is needed to cope with the spread of suicidal ideation and stress.",

For example, being male, having good physical health [6], social support [7], low body mass index [8], and living in rural areas [9] are associated with decreased suicidal ideation. Social support from family and high academic achievement are associated with less stress [10], while subjective health [11] and high body weight [12] are linked to high stress. Importantly, increased physical activity is correlated with low suicidal ideation [13] and stress [14,15]. Despite the possible benefits, many high school students are less likely to participate in physical activity outside of school (vigorous physical activity = 27.26 min/week, moderate physical activity = 36.99 min/week) [16]. However, when adolescents participated in high levels of physical education at school, they also exhibited elevated physical activity outside of school [17]. This link implies the need to verify the potential role of physical education on adolescent mental health. ",

For example, students who engaged in frequent physical education also had high academic achievement [19]. In addition, increased participation in physical education is associated with a lower likelihood of obesity and cardiovascular risk among adolescents [20]. Likewise, when adolescents have good experiences with their physical education, they may accumulate a positive attitude towards physical activity generally [21]. Positive interactions with teachers could also affect health-related quality of life [22]. Therefore, these classes are potentially an important setting to promote values (e.g., active lifestyles) that discourage suicidal ideation and stress. However, as far as we are aware, little is known regarding the role of physical education in influencing suicidal ideation and stress among adolescents.",

            "text": "Available research on physical education has largely focused on improvements to leisure-time physical activity and physical health [23,24,25]. Although a study found no associations between physical education and suicidal behaviors in middle school students [26], high educational pressure forces adolescents to spend about 15 h a day on studying, including school, homework, and private tutoring (cram schools) [27]. This heavy workload may lead to elevated stress levels. Despite the compulsory nature of physical education in South Korea [28], approximately 75% of high schools failed to implement national curriculum guidelines for physical education (150 min/week) [29], instead replacing that time with self-guided study to prepare for university admission exams [28]. Promoting awareness of physical activity\u2019s potential ameliorating effects is one strategy to proactively cope with mental health problems in adolescents. The aim of this research was to verify whether participating in physical education influences suicidal ideation and stress in high school students from South Korea. Because physical activity participation has a clear gender difference [16], we examined male and female students separately.",

During the data collection of KYRBS, students did not provide any personal identifiers such as names, phone numbers, or living address. Participating students were all volunteers across 400 middle and high schools, representing 17 administrative areas. Students took the survey in their school\u2019s computer room under teacher supervision and their anonymity was ensured. They provided consent before the survey was initiated [32].

Here, we add to that existing body of knowledge by demonstrating that physical education (\u22652 times/weekly) may reduce suicidal ideation in male high school students. Our findings partially corroborate earlier research showing that physical activity outside of school is linked to lower suicidal ideation [13]. However, our data contradicted a previous study showing that physical education was not associated with suicidal ideation among middle school students [26]. Interestingly, that same study showed that sports team engagement inside or outside school is linked to a decreased likelihood of suicidal ideation [26]. The apparent benefit of sports teams may be due to increased freedom (choice to attend), given that these sports are outside regular school curricula. Another possible reason for the difference between that study and ours is the participant pool; middle school students may experience less academic pressure than high school students. Finally, the previous study did not investigate gender differences, and so the lack of an effect among girls may have obscured an effect among boys. Following the national curriculum on physical education and providing suitable prevention programs therein could alleviate suicidal ideation and potentially reduce suicide attempts among male students [5].",

Stress levels among South Korean high school students are very high because of increased academic pressure [50] and greater emphasis on education [39] compared with other cultures. Indeed, two thirds of adolescents suffer from stress in South Korea [4]. Therefore, when attempting to implement curriculum guidelines for physical education, schools should exercise caution to avoid performance stress in the event of that students do poorly in physical education classes [51]. Importantly, physical education should not be added on top of existing academic classes; instead, high schools could instead reallocate self-guided study time to physical education [28].",

Second, although physical education predicted suicidal ideation (in boys only) and stress (both genders), there is no data on whether the association extends to suicidal attempts [5]. Further studies could address this question via mediation or structural analyses. Finally, the results of the current study are not fully generalizable because we used self-reports to measure participation in physical education. To lessen measurement bias, accelerometers are recommended as an objective method to assess the duration and intensity of physical activity [54]. We do note the value of using a database such as KYRBS for a nationally representative assessment; moreover, the results of the current study can be easily compared with previous adolescent research that also employed KYRBS data [16].",
