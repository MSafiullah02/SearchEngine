Recipients of information about emerging threats have limited, or no knowledge of the threat (e.g., the disease) and thus may benefit from receiving health information, particularly when the information travels quickly, and the format is brief and accessible (Shearer and Gottfried, 2017). The present study draws on models of health communications to answer the following questions: What are the associations of the volume of legacy and social media data with risk perceptions and protective behaviors? Do these associations vary across subpopulations with higher (vs. lower) risk of Zika infection? Understanding the influences of social and legacy media coverage of a novel health risk is important for health prevention and control as well as an optimal communication policy (Srinivasan, 2010).",

Other less confirmed modes of transmission are blood transfusions and exposure to infected patients in healthcare settings (CDC, 2017a; WHO, 2017). The first sexual transmission of the Zika virus in the United States was reported on February 2, 2016 (CDC, 2017a; WHO, 2017); by mid-to-late summer of that year, local cases were identified in Florida (CDC, 2017b). These patterns suggest the potential for rapid growth in areas where the Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitos live, and a high volume of inhabitants who travel to and from Zika-affected regions. Despite recordings of Zika infections as early as 1952, only recently was the Zika virus conclusively linked to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (PAHO/WHO, 2016), a rare neurological disorder in which the immune system attacks the peripheral nerves (Oduyebo et al., 2016), and to microcephaly, a rare condition in which the virus attacks the nervous system of fetuses and children (Mlakar et al., 2016; WHO, 2016).",

            "text": "Understanding risk perceptions of a public health crisis and the protective behaviors are critical for disease prevention and control: Outbreaks of Zika virus cases in the year 2016 represented an ideal opportunity to observe population levels of risk perceptions and behaviors and the extent to which social and legacy media coverage influence these levels. The present study of the 2016 media messages concerning Zika considered the view that emerging risk perceptions and protective behaviors in a population are best instilled by quickly updated information in social media. Fear appeals and risk perceptions have typically been studied in legacy media contexts (Becker, 1974; Rogers, 1983; Witte et al., 2001) but may exert effects in new media as well. A fear appeal refers to a persuasive message intended to arouse danger or threat perceptions to facilitate preventive motivation and protective behaviors (Earl et al., 2009; Rogers and Deckner, 1975; Tannenbaum et al., 2015). The public health research suggests that fear appeals can act as cues to action and elicit risk perceptions and health behaviors (Becker, 1974; Champion and Skinner, 2008). Whether risk perceptions and health behaviors are both affected by a message, however, depends on whether the health behavior is perceived as well-suited to reduce the risk (Fishbein et al., 1995; Rogers, 1983). When a behavior is perceived as efficacious at reducing the risk, messages that influence risk perceptions may also influence protective behaviors. In contrast, when protective behaviors cannot fully reduce the risk of infection, such as when an infection (e.g., Zika) is asymptomatic and reducing contact is difficult, protective behaviors and perceived risk may remain functionally independent (Rogers, 1983). All in all, however, the presence of a large volume of social and legacy media messages about the Zika virus may both increase risk perceptions and protective behaviors. Furthermore, perceived risk should depend on the level of actual vulnerability to infection (CDC, 2017b; McCarthy, 2016; PAHO/WHO, 2016), which, in the case of Zika virus, should be higher in households with current and/or intended pregnancy and in geographic areas of high activity of the Aedes mosquito.",

For example, exposure to H1N1 flu news on television has been linked to the heightened perceived risk of the pandemic disease in Taiwan (Chang, 2012). Currently, social media allows for receiving and sharing health information within a social network in a timely manner (Fox, 2014, 2011) and can also influence perceptions of risk and protective behaviors through informal influences within a community (Chew and Eysenbach, 2010; Choi et al., 2017). Yet, legacy and social media may exert differential effects in the context of the novel risk (see Bass et al., 2006; Johnson and Meischke, 1993; Kousky et al., 2010). When the first few Zika infections were confirmed, fast-paced social media, rather than legacy media, may have provided a more adequate channel to disseminate information than the more formal, slower legacy media channels.",

Choi et al. (2017) asked participants to report social media exposure and found a positive relation between exposure and risk perceptions of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Meanwhile, another group of researchers conducted a big data analysis of social media messages about the MERS in South Korea in 2015 (Song et al., 2017). These studies neither addressed the connections between media coverage and community risk perceptions and behaviors nor provided answers to the question of differential effects of social and legacy media. This gap in knowledge is worth filling, because while the media are ideally positioned to influence risk perceptions and subsequent behavioral responses, legacy and social media may play different roles in alerting the public.",

About 1000 interviews were conducted each week, of which at least 600 were obtained from cell phone respondents. Within each landline household, a single respondent (the youngest adult) was selected. Cell phone respondents were considered separately from landlines as the interview could take place outside the respondent's home.

We tracked the volume of information communicated in legacy and social media for only 25 weeks, a timespan which restricted the use of other forecasting techniques such as the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models (Hyndman and Kostenko, 2007). Future work should track a longer period (or a shorter period for each wave), such as a wave per week for a year, and investigate other potential explanatory characteristics, such as the persuasiveness of the information delivered in the media (Albarrac\u00edn et al., 2017a, 2017b; Fishbein and Cappella, 2006; Petty and Cacioppo, 1986). In the present study, the legacy media coverage only included English news reports, prints, and broadcasts, whereas legacy media coverage in Spanish was not available. Even though the sampled legacy media are likely representative of the entire legacy media coverage in the United States, and Hispanics often consume news in English (Lopez and Gonzalez-Barrera, 2013), future research should investigate the effect of the Spanish legacy media. Furthermore, the variables measured in the surveys were limited to the perception of the risk of infection over the next six months, and to protective behaviors such as taking mosquito-prevention measures and discussing Zika with healthcare professionals and providers. Other studies should expand the list of psychological variables to include efficacy beliefs (Brown, 2014; Rimal and Juon, 2010). Finally, our study focused on the community level instead of considering any change at the individual level. Future studies should combine surveys with tracks of legacy and social media exposure from individual participants to determine whether our findings replicate at the individual level. Nonetheless, this study provided valuable information about the role of legacy and social media in communicating about the risks of a geographically-dispersed disease.",
