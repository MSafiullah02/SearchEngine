Finally, foals were divided in 4 groups based on the infectious agents most commonly detected in the feces (C. perfringens, C. difficile, Salmonella spp., and rotavirus). Virtually all coinfections involved detection of a parasite (Parascaris equorum, Strongylus spp., Giardia spp., Trichostrongylus spp.) along with Salmonella, C. difficile, or rotavirus. Because these parasites are not typically recognized as causes of diarrhea in foals, they were grouped based on the bacterial or viral agent detected. In preliminary analyses, age was found to be significantly different between groups. Because many clinical examination parameters and laboratory variables vary according to age, a general linear model with age as a covari-ate was used to compare continuous variables between the 4 groups.

These results suggest that rotavirus is less likely to induce a systemic inflammatory response than those other pathogens. Rotavirus is a suspected cause of disease in many species and has been positively correlated with diarrhea in foals. 6 Electron microscopy is usually considered the gold standard test for detection of rotavirus. Consistent with previous reports, the current study found very good sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and agreement between rotavirus ELISA when compared with electron microscopy. 8 C. perfringens was cultured frequently in this population of foals with a median age of 3 days. In a casecontrol study of foal diarrhea, culture of C. perfringens was significantly associated with both diarrhea and death from diarrhea. 6 This is in direct contrast to another report in which C. perfringens was isolated from 90% of 3-day-old foals on 6 farms and no association with diarrhea was found. 19 In that 2nd report, genotyping revealed that 85% of the isolates were of type A and only 2% of these isolates were positive for the enterotoxin gene by PCR. 19 In the present study, only 2 of 17 foals with positive C. perfringens fecal culture were also positive for the enterotoxin (CPE) by ELISA and only 3 of 24 isolates tested were positive for the enterotoxin gene by PCR amplification. In the present study, 6 of 8 foals positive by CPE ELISA had a negative C. perfringens culture. This indicates either a falsely positive CPE ELI-SA or a falsely negative culture. In adult horses, the proportion of CPE positive is significantly greater in animals with diarrhea than in healthy controls. 20 In the aforementioned study, there was no association between C. perfringens spore count and CPE in the feces. 20 Consistent with these findings, there was poor agreement between C. perfringens culture and toxin detection in the present study. Detection of CPE in the feces of foals was not associated with a worse prognosis in the present study when compared with foals with a positive C. perfringens culture and negative CPE test results. The prevalence of C. difficile A and/or B toxin detection in the feces of diarrheic foals in the present study (11/233; 5%) was considerably lower than previously reported (5/30; 17%) in another study. 20 In contrast, C. difficile toxins or toxin genes are rarely detected in the feces of normal foals. 20 Salmonella is known to cause enteritis and colitis in many species including adult horses. 21 In 1 case-control study of foal diarrhea, there was no significant association between culture of Salmonella from the feces and presence of diarrhea. 6 However, presence of Salmonella in the feces was significantly associated with fatal illness. 6 In the present study, the survival proportion of foals with a positive Salmonella culture (23/28; 82%) was not significantly different from any other group including foals with rotavirus (44/47; 94%). However, the lack of statistical significance may be the result of the small sample size; hence, low statistical power of the comparison. In the present study, 7 of 12 (58%) foals with a positive Salmonella culture had a blood culture positive for at least 1 microorganism. Two of 4 foals, which grew Salmonella from a blood culture, were also positive for Salmonella in the feces. These results differ slightly from a previous report in which 64% of 22 Salmonella shedders were blood culture positive and all 8 foals who had Salmonella bacteremia were also fecal shedders. 22 This can be explained by the fact that Salmonella was more likely to be cultured from the feces of foals 4 1 month of age in the present study and older foals were significantly less likely to be bacteremic.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 166, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 167, "end": 169, "text": "8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 170, "end": 172, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 356, "end": 359, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 360, "end": 362, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 575, "end": 577, "text": "18", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1057, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1334, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1571, "end": 1572, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1738, "end": 1740, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1898, "end": 1900, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2436, "end": 2438, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2550, "end": 2552, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3082, "end": 3084, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3183, "end": 3185, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3430, "end": 3431, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3526, "end": 3527, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 4303, "end": 4305, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The importance of many parasites as a cause of diarrhea in foals is uncertain. One previous study identified a significant association between the identification of S. westeri and the presence of diarrhea in foals. 6 In the current study, P. equorum was the most commonly identified parasite. P. equorum is a documented cause of colic, mild respiratory disease, and overall poor doing in foals. Diarrhea has not been shown to be related to infection with this pathogen. In 8 of 10 foals from which P. equorum was identified, a 2nd infectious agent was also detected in the feces. This suggests that, although Parascaris ova were present, they were probably not the cause of diarrhea. It is not surprising that foals 41 month were significantly more likely to have parasite ova identified in their feces. Parascaris and Strongylus ova were most commonly identified in the present population. With the exception of S. westerii, these parasites have prepatent periods ranging from 4 weeks to 6 months.

Using the reported cut-off of 11, the sensitivity and specificity of sepsis score to predict a positive blood culture were 41 and 64%, respectively. The low sensitivity and specificity of the sepsis score in predicting blood culture results has also been recognized in prior studies. 24, 25 However, sepsis score was a good indicator of outcome in the current study with odds of survival 6.1 times lower in foals with a sepsis score ! 14 than in foals with a lower sepsis score on admission.
