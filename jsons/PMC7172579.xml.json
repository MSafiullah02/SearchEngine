            "text": "Aminopeptidases (\u03b1-aminoacyl-peptide hydrolase, EC 3.4.11.-) catalyze the hydrolysis of amino acid residues from the amino terminus of peptide substrates [33]. These enzymes have broad specificity and occur in several forms. They are widely distributed in many tissues or cells, on cell surfaces, and in soluble or secreted forms in plants and animals [17]. Although some of them are well characterized, their biological roles have not yet been elucidated. Some aminopeptidases have been reported to act on bioactive peptide such as enkephalin [9]and tuftsin [19]. A scheme based on the zinc binding site has been extended to classify zinc metalloproteases into five distinct families by Hooper [8]. Recently Vazeux et al. [34]provided evidence that Glu-408 was the third zinc-coordinating residue of aminopeptidase A (glutamyl-aminopeptidase, EC 3.4.11.7), confirmed the presumed involvement of Glu-386 in the catalytic process of the enzyme, and identified the enzyme as a zinc metallopeptidase functionally similar to thermolysin (EC 3.4.24.27).",

            "text": "There are two distinct aminopeptidases in the chicken's (Gallus gallus domesticus) egg. One is aminopeptidase Ey (EC 3.4.11.20) from yolk 10, 29, 30, 31, 32, and the other is glutamyl aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.7) from egg white [24]. In a previous study [10], we purified and characterized a new aminopeptidase Ey from egg yolk. This is a homodimeric enzyme composed of two identical subunits with a relative molecular mass of 150 k 29, 32; we called it aminopeptidase Ey. Aminopeptidase Ey has unique specificities: broad selectivity for amino acid residues at the P1 position of substrates [29]; similar specificity toward the proline residue at the P1\u2032 position\n2 of aminopeptidase P (X-prolylaminopeptidase, EC 3.4.11.9); and preference specificity toward small peptides with four or five amino acid residues [30]. In a further study of substrate specificity, we found that aminopeptidase Ey was able to degrade a chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe) and released N-formyl-methionine, leucine and phenylalanine [31]. The peptide lost its chemotactic activity toward human neutrophile after incubation with aminopeptidase Ey [31].",

Using the method of Kyte and Doolittle [12], the hydrophobicity plots of aminopeptidase Ey and aminopeptidase N from rabbit are shown in Fig. 3\n. A hydrophobic region at amino acid position 9\u201332 is found in each aminopeptidase. It has been reported that the hydrophobic region of aminopeptidase N from mammals forms the anchor to the membrane, the region of amino acid position 2\u20138 is in cytoplasmic space 36, 38, and carboxy terminal regions of the mammalian enzyme containing the aminopeptidase active site signifies the ectodomain. From the results of similarity of hydropathy plot and sequence homology, aminopeptidase Ey can also be assumed to be a membrane protein, but about 95% of the total aminopeptidase Ey activity was found in egg yolk plasma fraction in a soluble form [10]. Many aminopeptidases N are located on the membrane surface, but some of the enzymes occur as the soluble form. Human bile, for instance, contains a soluble form of aminopeptidase N. It is thought that the enzyme is probably released from the biliary canalicular membrane by the detergent activity of bile salts and may be one factor promoting cholesterol crystallization in the gallbladder [21]. Intestinal aminopeptidases N are found as various isoforms. They are fragmented by limited proteolysis with trypsin [4]. The tryptic cleavage site of the enzyme is N-terminal hydrophobic\u2013hydrophilic junction between 39Lys and 40Asn [6]. Aminopeptidase Ey is also thought to be cleaved at the same position as the 39Lys\u201340Ser bond by an unknown trypsin-like enzyme in egg yolk, and the enzyme might be released from membrane. The following region at amino acid position 40\u201369 of aminopeptidase Ey is not homologous to that of aminopeptidases N, but these region are Ser- and Thr-rich in both enzymes. Ser- and Thr-rich domains tend to be O-glycosylated [7]. In a present work, amino terminal amino acid sequence of aminopeptidase Ey could not be determined, probably due to limited digestion caused by continuous O-glycosylated Ser/Thr.",

Purified aminopeptidase Ey has an isoelectric point of 2.8 [29]. After treatment with sialidase, the enzyme shows a sharp band at pI 4.4. As the calculated relative molecular mass of aminopeptidase Ey is 108 669, about 40 kDa of carbohydrate must be linked to the enzyme. This is reminiscent of the human aminopeptidase N which has a deduced molecular mass of aminopeptidase N of 109 542 Da, but the molecular mass of the purified subunit of the enzyme is 150 kDa. The isoelectric point of human aminopeptidase N is 4.7 [28]. Obviously, the human enzyme is also modified with carbohydrates, but the human enzyme may not contain sialic acid.",

Aminopeptidase N in the human placenta may be to desensitize the action of immunomodulating peptides as well as vasoactive and neuropeptide hormones, and to control both immunology and endocrinology of pregnancy [18]. Rat brain aminopeptidase N is involved in the degradation of regulatory peptides including enkephalins [15]. Cell-surface aminopeptidase N of murine and human metastatic tumor cells may be partly involved in the activation mechanism for type-IV collagenolysis to achieve tumor-cell invasion [26]. Aminopeptidase N of human and porcine is a receptor for coronaviruses, during viral infection. 5, 39. Mammalian intestinal brush-border membrane aminopeptidase N hydrolyzes oligomeric peptides for digestion and transports the resultant free amino acids 2, 20, 25. As there are few reports about avian aminopeptidase N, the role of aminopeptidase Ey in egg yolk is uncertain. Aminopeptidase Ey may participate in the maturation and/or degradation of peptidic hormones concerned with ontogenesis, as mammalian placental aminopeptidase N and brain aminopeptidase N are concerned with the control of the level of peptide hormones. Possibly, aminopeptidase Ey may degrade the oligomeric peptides derived from the storage proteins for supplying amino acids to embryo, as the role of intestinal aminopeptidase N is the digestion of oligopeptides and the absorption of resultant amino acids.",
