Owing to the high infectious rate and the absence of definitive therapeutic Western medicines, State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the People's Republic of China proposed six TCM formulae to general public as preventive measures on 24 April 2003 (http://www.satcm.gov.cn/zhuanti/jbfz/20060901/100052.shtml). Houttuynia cordata was one of the component herbs in a heat-removing and detoxifying formula. In order to reveal its underlying mechanisms in preventing SARS, HC was investigated for its immunomodulatory effect in mouse splenic lymphocytes and inhibitory activity on SARS coronaviral 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) in this work.",

Anti-viral CD4+ helper T cells (Th) help the production of virus-specific antibodies by B cells, while CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (Tc) can kill virus-infected host cells. Lymphopenia was usually observed in SARS patients at the initial phase of infection (Li et al., 2003, Yu et al., 2003, He et al., 2005). Virus-induced apoptosis of lymphocytes has been suggested as a cause for lymphopenia seen in SARS patients (O\u2019Donnell et al., 2003). Since monocytes and T cells are involved in both the innate and adaptive immune response, destruction of these cells may result in a compromised immune response and the development of disease. Our results demonstrated that HC extract could exhibit immunostimulatory effect (Fig. 1; Table 1, Table 2). It was found to stimulate the proliferation of CD4+ helper T cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, which may help to prevent SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "CD4+ helper T cells can be divided into different subtypes, based on the specific profiles of cytokines that they release. Th1 cells have been found to produce IL-2, IFN-\u03b3 and lymphotoxin-\u03b1, whereas Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-9 and IL-13 (Romagnani, 2006). Th1 cells assist in activating macrophages and Tc cells, which are particularly useful for eliminating intracellular infections; Th2 cells mediate anti-helminth and allergic responses. Type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cells are distinct from the classical Th1 or Th2 cells. They produce high levels of IL-10, with or without TGF-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-5, and low or no IL-2 and IL-4 (Veldman et al., 2006). IL-10 has a key effect on the suppression of Th1 cell responses and has a role in host protection against harmful effects of an exacerbated cellular immune response during acute infection. In order to investigate how HC extract affect the T cell differentiation, we measured the levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 secreted by mouse splenic lymphocytes. From our results, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 that are secreted by Th1 and Th2, respectively, did not increase. On the contrary, IL-10 that is secreted by Tr1 increased significantly after treatment. We speculated that HC extract caused the induction of Tr1. In the 3H-thymidine incorporation assay, the stimulatory response in 72 h is lower than that of 48 h (Fig. 1). This may due to the negative feedback by Tr1 cells that suppress Th cells response. Induction of Tr1 cells can assist in turning off immune response after pathogen elimination and prevent harmful effect. However, further in-depth studies are needed to confirm the induction of Tr1 by HC extract.",

This functional importance of 3CLpro in the life cycle of virus makes it a key target for the development of drugs directed against SARS (Anand et al., 2003, Gan et al., 2006, Wu et al., 2006) and for screening the anti-SARS effect of traditional Chinese medicines (Lin et al., 2005). In order to study the effect of HC extract on SARS-CoV 3CLpro, a convenient protein-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay system was set up for measuring the enzyme activity. The substrate for assay is a recombinant protein that has a cleavable linker sequence (TSAVLQ\u2193SGFRK) between two fluorescent proteins, viz CFP and YFP. The former one is the donor protein of which the emission spectrum overlaps with the excitation spectrum of the latter acceptor protein. If these two fluorophores are very close to each other, FRET will occur. When excited at 430 nm, CFP will emit fluorescent at 486 nm that will in turn excite YFP and cause it to emit fluorescent at 530 nm. If the SARS-CoV 3CLpro is active, the linker sequence will be cleaved, two fluorophores separated and the fluorescence ratio at 530/486 decreased. HC extract, at 200 \u03bcg/ml or above, could effectively inhibit the decrease in fluorescence ratio of the substrate, implying that it could inactivate the SARS-CoV 3CLpro.",

It is the essential enzyme in a replicase complex that is expected to contain additional viral and cellular proteins (Thiel et al., 2003). Given the crucial role of RdRp in the virus life cycle and the success obtained with polymerase inhibitors in the treatment of viral infections including human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), human hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Korba et al., 2006), HCV and herpes virus, SARS-CoV RdRp is an attractive target for the development of anti-SARS drugs. At present, there are no structural and very limited biochemical data on coronavirus polymerase. Thus, study on the polymerization mechanisms is likely to aid the development of anti-SARS agent. It is reported that during purification, the full-length enzyme is found to be hydrolytically cleaved into three main fragments: an N-terminal p12 fragment, a middle p30 fragment, and a C-terminal p64 fragment which comprises the polymerase catalytic domain (Cheng et al., 2005). Currently, the recombinant SARS-RdRp expressed in E. coli is characterized by radioactive assay (Al et al., 1998, Yamashita et al., 1998, Cheng et al., 2005) and we demonstrated that radiolabeled nucleotides incorporation increased with increasing SARS-CoV RdRp protein (Data not shown).
