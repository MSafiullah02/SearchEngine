Adults with COVID-19 presenting with progressive and/or severe lymphopenia and an increasing neutrophil count have been associated with higher disease severity (13) (14) (15) (16) . In addition, adults who have required ICU care have had higher levels of circulating cytokines associated with the innate immune response (16) . Clinical worsening in the adult population has been described to occur in the second week of illness, in keeping with the proposed pro-inflammatory pathophysiology, resulting in progressive lung injury (15) .

Many centers have limited the number of caregivers at the bedside to one caregiver, restricting movement of the caregiver in the hospital, and ensure that staff maintains PPE when at the bedside. Clearly, given the high rates of familial clustering, there is a high likelihood of these family members being similarly infected, and local public health guidance should be followed to ensure minimal risk of nosocomial spread. Within this environment, the ability to deliver the same standard of family-centered care that is given during peacetime will be significantly compromised.

The hashtags #PedsICU and #COVID19 have garnered high volumes of information for Twitter users online. These social media channels, in combination with Free Open Access Medical Education websites such as Open Pediatrics and the Life in the Fast Lane blog (www.litfl.com) have also served as international COVID-19 resources and facilitated knowledge sharing at a rapid rate and fostered a powerful sense of community amongst practitioners.",

Social distancing has been implemented in several countries and regular hospital meetings, teaching sessions, and conferences have largely been canceled. Anxiety about personal welfare as well as the safety of family and friends cannot be underestimated. Hospital and ICU leadership is critical during this time and communication about plans and workflows needs to be measured and wellpaced. It is wise to consider programs in the unit and hospital to encourage staff and to consider measures to cater to mental wellbeing of staff.",

The substantial rise in international numbers, however, necessitates early planning in consideration of a rise in pediatric cases.

In addition, the international PICU community should act together to share information rapidly given the limited amount of information we have on these critically ill children. ",
