This study summarizes obstacles to the implementation of telemedicine for adolescents, and proposed solutions. Observations made during this process have implications for the continued use of telemedicine to improve healthcare access beyond the current pandemic. 2 The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic is a rapidly evolving public health crisis. Uptake of telemedicine has been one response utilized by providers to continue caring for patients while minimizing risk of exposure or transmission of COVID-19. [1] [2] [3] [4] The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) defines telemedicine as twoway, live communication between the patient and provider at a distant site including audio and video equipment. [5] This may occur with or without the assistance of peripheral medical examination devices (e.g. electronic stethoscope, etc) and can augment but should not fully replace in-person medical visits. [6, 7] Telemedicine has been increasingly recognized in recent years as a tool to improve access to healthcare. [8] [9] [10] [11] Despite successful expansion of telemedicine in some areas, persistent barriers to widespread implementation include patient and provider acceptance, technical connectivity challenges, infrastructure to support Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant care, and unavoidable deviations from clinical standards of care. [7] Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has challenged clinicians to rapidly determine how to provide high quality care while addressing the public health needs of the community. The appropriate response may vary by patient population, specialty, practice setting, and local availability of resources.",

Initially we did not offer well care visits due to our inability to monitor height, weight, blood pressure, vision, and hearing as recommended by Bright Futures, though we later established a protocol for obtaining at home weights for those patients with a scale. [21] Additionally, vaccines and screening for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), STIs, and dyslipidemia could only be completed in person with the help of nurses or phlebotomists. However, many aspects of adolescent and young adult care recommended by Bright Futures were possible to implement via telemedicine including screening for depression, substance use, psycho-social development (e.g. the HEADDS Assessment), and general anticipatory guidance. [21] Another limitation of our initial telemedicine rollout was that our social workers and dietitians were not available in real-time as they had been in the clinic's former practice model. Telemedicine visits began with one registered dietitian. An additional dietitian and social worker were on boarded by the second week of implementation. To facilitate 8 internal referrals, we created a shared list of patients requiring consultation with these providers in the EMR. Ongoing efforts aim to further integrate our social work and dietitian colleagues into our telemedicine practice.",
