IRES elements have been reported in tobacco etch virus (TEV), crucifer infecting tobamovirus (crTMV), hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus (HCRSV), and many other animal and plant RNA viruses. In this chapter, the methodology used to identify and characterize a plant virus IRES element, including construction of a translation reporter vector for testing the IRES activity, testing the IRES activity in coupled in vitro transcription and translation systems and mammalian cells analysis of RNA stability, and sucrose gradient analysis and polysome profiling, is presented.",

            "text": "In eukaryotes, translation initiation involves recruitment of 40S ribosomal subunits at either the 5\u2032 m7G cap structure or internal ribosome entry sites (IRES). The ribosomal subunit together with other factors locates a start codon and protein synthesis begins following binding of the 60S ribosomal subunit, terminating at a stop codon (1, 2) . To fully use their compact genomes, viruses have evolved various mechanisms either to redirect the translational machinery to favor viral transcripts or to regulate the expression of internal genes. Genome partitioning and the use of sgRNAs are common mechanisms used by many plant viruses to make their internal genes accessible for the ribosome (3) . In addition, nonorthodox strategies such as the use of internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES) elements have been exploited by viruses to express multiple genes from a single RNA species. IRES elements are initially discovered in picornavirus RNAs to confer internal initiation independent of the 5' end (4, 5) . Since then, functional IRES elements have been reported in various viral and cellular messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Cellular mRNAs that contain IRES elements encode a wide variety of proteins such as translation initiation factors, transcription factors, oncogenes, homoeotic genes, and growth factors (6) . IRES elements have also been reported in plant viruses such as Tobacco etch virus (TEV) (7) and Crucifer infecting tobamovirus (crTMV) (8, 9) .",

Most of the known viral IRESs are located in 5' UTRs, highly structured and contain multiple conserved AUGs. Parts of the secondary structure of IRES elements associated with activity include sequences that form part of double-stranded regions (12, 13) or sequences located in apical or internal loops (14, 15) . Disruptions of these regions have been associated with the modification of essential RNA-protein interactions (16) . The GNRA tetraloop, an example of a conserved motif located at a distal loop in the central domain of Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) IRES, has been indicated to be involved in long range RNA interactions (14) . Such RNA-RNA interactions, dependent on RNA concentration, ionic conditions, and temperature (17, 18) , suggest dynamism in the tertiary structure of IRES that may play an important role in the IRES activity. Identification and characterization of a putative IRES element can be tested in wheat germ extract, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and mammalian cells. ",

A reporter gene (such as green fluorescent protein, GFP) at the 5' end is used as an internal control for the internal initiation event and the stability of RNA templates during translation. 2. The region containing the IRES element is inserted into a bicistronic construct containing GFP gene as the 5' cistron and the envelope (E) protein gene of coronavirus Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (21) as the 3' cistron, giving rise to construct pGFP-IRES-E. 3. A series of sequential deletions of the full-length sequence containing a putative IRES element is carried out to delineate the region responsible for internal initiation. When the expression of the reporter gene is observed to be reduced by several folds, it indicates that the IRES element has been deleted. Construct pGFP-E, containing the GFP gene and the E protein gene in different reading frames, are used as controls (22) . 4. Expression of pGFP-E resulted in the detection of GFP. With the insertion of the putative IRES element inserted between the 5' and 3' cistrons, the GFP encoded by the 5' cistron and the E protein encoded by the 3' cistron were expressed. 5. To avoid repeated freezing and thawing of the coupled transcription and translation kit. It is advisable to aliquot the wheat germ extracts after the first usage. 6. Constructs containing deletions under the control of a T7 promoter are expressed transiently in semiconfluent monolayers of vTF7-3-infected Cos-7 cells. 7. To handle RNA with care so that it will not be degraded by RNase and affect the results.",

The translation mixture is cooled on ice and layered onto a 10-30% (w/v) linear sucrose gradient (2 mL) in buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mM KCl, and 5 mM MgCl 2 . The gradient was then subjected to centrifugation at 259,000 g in an appropriate rotor at 4 \u00b0C for 60 min. 4. Fractions of 200 \u00b5L are collected from the top of the gradient and measured at absorbance 260 nm to obtain the polysome profile. 5. Based on the polysome profile, fractions are pooled and RNA extracted by phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitation. 6.
