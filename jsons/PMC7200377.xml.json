It has touched the lives of everyone on the planet in one or the other way. Complete cities and countries amid lockdown scenarios have come to a deadlock, the industries and manufacturing sectors have taken a complete halt. The countries and the government bodies that have imposed a complete mandatory \u201cStay in house\u201d, which would be successful only if uninterrupted supply of electrical power or energy would be provided to them. Without providing round the clock uninterrupted supply of energy the \u201cStay in house\u201d would fail because residents seek out of homes to satisfy their basic energy needs. The domestic utilities must be continuously kept alive round the clock without switching off. It is a challenging time for the local administration to keep alive; operations and distribution of electricity because the cost of running administration and energy distribution without any revenues.",

The situation of loss in income and rising electricity bills makes a huge economic and financial burden on households. The wavering or suspension of utility bills by the governments in pandemic times alleviates the financial burden on household. Therefore it is much needed policy plan by the current governments to tackle economically the COVID-19 pandemic situation . The flowchart in Fig 3\nexplains the pandemic situation in detail.",

These G20 Member countries contribute to 85% of global economic output, 80% of primary electricity consumption and they have 66% of the world\u2019s population [1]. Any minor economic or financial imbalance of these G20 countries have a huge impact on the world\u2019s economy. This imbalance has the potential to create an economic catastrophe globally. Therefor amid the COVID-19 emergency it is necessary to revisit the government policies and actions towards Energy consumption in buildings. The energy literature for G20 countries is rare [1]. This paper investigates the action taken by G20 countries towards domestic energy consumption while corona virus pandemic outbreak. The enerdata global energy statistics handbook of 2019 reports; for the year 2018 the total domestic electricity consumption was globally was 22968Twh and for G20 countries it was 21056Twh as depicted in Fig 4\n.",
