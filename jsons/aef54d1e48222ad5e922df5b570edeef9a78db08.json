The pathogen has been identified as a novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus-2 that currently has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has a phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV. 1 Patients with the infection have been in the hospital, in family and work environments, and in communities. The World Health Organization has recently declared the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern. 2,3 At the end of January 2020, mainland China reported 11 791 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections that resulted in 259 deaths. 4, 5 Initially, cases were thought to arise from zoonotic transmission; however, recently published literature reveals evidence of human-to-human transmission that increased exponentially by travel, with many cases detected in other parts of the world. [6] [7] [8] This geographic expansion beyond the initial epicenter of Wuhan provides an opportunity to study the natural history of COVID-19 infection. 9 In relation to the transmission risk of COVID-19, 10 on January 25, 2020, the Italian Ministry of Health issued the first order with prophylactic measures against COVID-19. After the first one, many ordinances and regulatory circulars defined both prevention measures of behavioral and treatment rules for suspected cases. On February 20, 2020, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in a hospital in Codogno, Italy (a little city of Lodi province in the low Po Valley), hereafter defined as the \"red zone\" (no entry or leave zone, including 10 cities around Codogno, with quarantine commitment for all citizens). This represented the starting point for extraordinary measures of national and regional management evolving on the basis of the infections registered.",

Lombardy Region Government transferred to Lodi Major Hospital's crisis unit complete decision-making power, without the hospital ethics board and master and commander approval. The crisis unit was formed involving hospital staff (general health, nursing), department directors, logistics heads, representatives of critical units in the management of COVID-19 patients, and press coordinator. There was direct collaboration of the prefecture government, law enforcement, civil protection, city, province, and regional governments, as well as indirect collaboration with the National Health Institution, government, and Ministry of Health.

The observation in the first days allowed us to identify the common symptoms and signs of the infection, and from this observation the director of the ED designed a model to effectively triage patients and obtain rapid frame rates of respiratory failure and responsiveness of the patients to the oxygen treatment. The director was able to redistribute the ED areas for the different types and needs of patients in scale model and at the same time develop clinical documentation of rapid interpretation to evaluate the improvement or deterioration of the patients (Figure 1 ), all the while identifying the necessary devices to guarantee the treatment of symptoms.",

The only country with published data and epidemiological or management studies was represented by the Chinese reality. 9,10,17,18 However, the health system and the Chinese government represent a very far model from the Italian reality where health is regional and where each ASST has significant autonomy, such as the possibilities available to try to improve and optimize management and logistical choices. Applicable and effective models could result: major-emergency management and military management. Both systems ensure resource optimization in relation to large inflows. 19 Starting from the concept of advanced medical post and the use of the action plan for the major-emergency, we were able to organize the crisis unit as the hospital's operations center. At the same time, however, we were not certain about the number of infections or about the real needs of patients. This was the critical point for the initial management. It was therefore necessary to initiate internal analyses that were possible due to the efforts of the ED where epidemiological and health data are recorded up to the first access. After 72 hours, it was therefore possible to have not only the pattern of inflows, but also a realistic prediction of the necessary resources. Every effort was made to have a fluid model inside the hospital. Prospectively, patient management presents a linear management mode for patients who respond to only oxygen therapy: from ED to ward, circular one for the patient in need of ventilator support, from the ED will have to be allocated in 1 of the ventilated areas (depending on the need: ICU or sub-intensive) and then return to the ward. The hospital day by day owing to the data collected and to the great structural and logistical effort was designed as a fluid and circular model. However, the confrontation with the regional government and its health facilities has become decisive and fundamental. In fact, the circular model provides for the need for the involvement of different structures. The firstline hospital, in this case, is represented by a provincial hospital with a capacity limited to 300 beds. The role of the first-line hospital is to ensure framing and need of the patient, but largescale management of the patients involved must be matched. 20 This is why the regional network and transfers made it possible not to collapse at the first accesses of the frontline structure. This dynamics model was difficult to realize without reference models and without knowing the number of casualties, and this was not possible to obtain from the beginning; but the presence of all the representations in the management of the crisis has meant that, despite the low sensitivity of prospective data, the model has been applied allowing the management of the first phase of the emergency. In the same way, decentralized management of the first phase in the frontline hospital has allowed other structures, albeit in different ways, to prepare suitable space and line of management for COVID-19 patients.",
