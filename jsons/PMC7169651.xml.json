I stressed the anchoring effect of how the crisis first received worldwide attention. An overstretched doctor working in an intensive care unit at a hospital in Wuhan, China, panicked at the rate of patient intake and their rate of death\u2014and did so on social media. The social media part was the truly new development, arguably more novel than the coronavirus itself. After all, viruses mutate all the time and can even pass between species, and air pollution in Wuhan\u2014like other big Chinese cities\u2014had long been a breeding ground for the viruses that cause respiratory ailments. Indeed, it is an ecological legacy that has been felt in the waves of more or less lethal forms of \u2018influenza\u2019 worldwide that have beset the entire industrial era.",

After all, it is not every day that the Financial Times (2020) calls for a \u2018Welfare State 2.0\u2019 on a scale that 75 years ago led to the establishment of the United Nations. Because flu viruses typically feed on existing vulnerabilities in a patient\u2019s condition, hospitals would typically need to register a higher than expected morbidity rate before a new virus was detected. But of course, previously the world\u2019s health care systems were not being exposed simultaneously for all to see on social media. As the capacity for a virus to go \u2018viral\u2019 increases, sensitivity to the virus\u2019 presence increases, which in turn reduces the time before an \u2018epidemic\u2019 and then a \u2018pandemic\u2019 is declared, which serves to accelerate the comprehensiveness with which measures are taken to fight the virus. Moreover, and importantly, intensified scientific scrutiny on the virus also generates backpropagation effects, effectively a rewriting of medical history whereby earlier data is reclassified so that a greater number of people\u2014both living and deceased\u2014are revealed to have contracted the virus.",

In short: the more we look for Covid-19, the more likely we are to find it. What had been non-existent is now and always is everywhere. A similar observer effect will occur once the pandemic\u2019s conclusion is formally declared by the World Health Organization, and we properly enter the \u2018lessons to be learned\u2019 phase. There will undoubtedly be a reversal of fate for at least some policies that are currently being hailed or condemned, once the final toll has been taken. (I write this in early April 2020.) Indeed, the run-up to this second moment is marked by the sort of competitive expectation management that we normally see when \u2018bull\u2019 and \u2018bear\u2019 analysts try to forecast the stock market.

At the same time, others have written post-mortems on the UK strategy before all the bodies have been counted. The critics often make life easy for themselves by denying at once the validity of the target and the government\u2019s strategy to reach it\u2014typically by pointing to the example of Germany, which is expected to have many fewer deaths. So even if Vallance\u2019s \u2018good outcome\u2019 is met, the critics might still claim victory\u2014and indeed, accuse the UK government of having \u2018cynically\u2019 set its expectations low. An interesting epistemological difference between the government and its critics is that the government stresses that if a particular nation\u2019s Covid-19 strategy ends up appearing to have been successful, it will have been due to a combination of factors specific to that nation, whereas the critics stress that, say, Germany already possesses the all-purpose \u2018magic bullet\u2019\u2014mass testing of the population\u2014that nations everywhere should have deployed to conquer the virus. We might think of this difference as a matter of \u2018anticipatory diagnosis\u2019.",

At stake ultimately is not which nations tackle the virus most effectively but the terms on which \u2018effectiveness\u2019 is decided. If the virus is the opponent in a match against humanity, the main question is not who wins but who gets to name the game being played. It is a \u2018second order\u2019, not \u2018first order\u2019, problem, as the logicians say. This explains why the UK cannot simply get away with setting its own targets, even it meets them. Moreover, one can envisage \u2018third-order\u2019 terms in which to deal with Covid-19. So let us imagine that the current fight against the virus is \u2018completed\u2019, at least in the sense that the spread of Covid-19 is \u2018contained\u2019. This opens a market in which some are \u2018projecting\u2019 (i.e. both assuming and promoting) that \u2018we\u2019 (i.e. most of us) have won and others are projecting that we have lost. The former want to resume business as usual as quickly possible, while the latter want to take the radically changed circumstances as an opportunity to play a different game. That is the third-order game against the virus, on the cusp of which sits the Financial Times editorial mentioned earlier.",

Much of the organization\u2019s early rhetoric portrayed it as a proper world government that would establish human solidarity on a new footing, one that transcended the modern system of nation-states, known in international relations circles as the \u2018Westphalian Order\u2019. Thus, the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights alluded to the unprecedented horrors\u2014\u2018crimes against humanity\u2019\u2014unleashed by the Second World War as the pretext for the UN Charter. Indeed, the very idea of \u2018human rights\u2019 with juridical standing pointed to the insufficiency of \u2018civil rights\u2019 inscribed in national constitutions. No more business as usual! Unfortunately, the Charter\u2019s details reveal that the UN\u2019s powers are no more than what its constituent nation-states are willing to delegate to it. The UN has no independent authority to be a proper rival to the nation-states themselves, and over the years, it has best lived up to its early rhetorical promise when dealing with failed states and failed inter-state relations. In effect, the UN is little more than the Westphalian Order\u2019s insurer of last resort: It has maintained business as usual.",

However, it is worth recalling that \u2018business as usual\u2019 is also the spirit in which national governments have bailed out banks following global financial crashes from the Great Depression onward. To be sure, it has been in terms of the confident rhetoric of building \u2018robustness\u2019 and \u2018resilience\u2019 into the system\u2014but we are still talking about the same system that generated the crisis in the first place. Nevertheless, those who have wished to turn the latest global crisis into an opportunity for radical change\u2014from Marxists to environmentalists\u2014have been historically hamstrung by such rhetoric. In the 1930s, radical socialists were dealt a sharp and arguably irreversible blow by the speed with which Franklin Roosevelt proposed and enacted \u2018New Deal\u2019 legislation, whereby the emerging superpower showed the world the way back to business as usual in the capitalist world order. It is not unreasonable to look to the current emerging superpower, China, for guidance back to a post-pandemic business as usual\u2014especially since, like China today, the USA had practiced a notoriously protectionist international trade policy in the years prior to the Great Depression.",

Its \u2018no more business as usual\u2019 attitude is predicated on our having lost the fight against the virus. However, this may not be as bad as it first seems because we are imagining this prospect, rather than having experienced it. That cognitive difference can effectively immunize us from the worst effects of the virus\u2014or, indeed, any existential threat. At least that was how the great US Cold War strategist Herman Kahn (1962) thought about \u2018the unthinkable\u2019, namely, a thermonuclear war. Kahn estimated that the realistically worst outcome of a nuclear confrontation between the USA and USSR would kill no more than a third of the human population. And without denying such a tragic loss of life at an unprecedented scale, his strategic focus was on how the survivors might coordinate their activities to rebuild civilization. After all, the existing communication infrastructure would be among the most vulnerable targets of such an all-out war. This was the context in which the Internet was developed by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in the late 1960s. Of course, the imagined war never happened, but the Internet was rolled out anyway\u2014and became the platform on which the \u2018third industrial revolution\u2019 was launched (Rifkin 2011).",

More generally, its attitude to risk is not precautionary but proactionary\u2014which is to say, it capitalises on the nature of uncertainty to convert potential threats into opportunities (Fuller and Lipinska 2014). As Franklin Roosevelt put it in his 1933 inaugural presidential address, \u2018[t]here is nothing to fear but fear itself\u2019. However, the sensibility goes back to Baron Helmuth von Moltke\u2019s successful revision of strategic thinking during the 1870\u20131871 Franco-Prussian War. Moltke effectively raised the stakes of warfare from limited objectives to national security itself, always with an eye to the next war\u2014and there will be a next war, perhaps against some radically different opponent, even if one wins the current war against the known opponent. Moltke\u2019s vision was one of endless \u2018total war\u2019, which required the nation to be in a state of \u2018permanent emergency\u2019 to ensure that, whatever the outcome of any particular war, the nation is never defeated \u2018once and for all\u2019 but can always \u2018rise again\u2019 (Fuller 2000: 105).",

Philip Tetlock\u2019s concept of superforecasting, which duly acknowledges Moltke, is the latter-day incarnation of this mentality (Tetlock and Gardner 2015: chap. 10; Fuller 2018: chap. 7). But perhaps most consequential of all is what might be seen as a \u2018fourth-order\u2019 effect of the original fight against the virus. It came to be associated with Moltke\u2019s civilian commander, Otto von Bismarck, who turned the Second German Reich into the first modern welfare state\u2014what the US sociologist Alvin Gouldner (1970) pointedly called at the height of the Cold War 80 years later, the \u2018welfare-warfare state\u2019. Bismarck fully conceptualised the nation-state as an organism perpetually struggling for survival in a potentially hostile environment. Protection literally meant education and health coverage to keep everyone \u2018fighting fit\u2019 to contribute to economic productivity in peacetime and military might in wartime.

Bismarck\u2019s solution was to introduce retirement pensions, showing that people were valued even when they were not directly contributing to national security. This resulted in a comprehensive \u2018social security\u2019 system, which extended beyond the borders of the nation-state to its constituent human members. In terms of the Realpolitik of which Bismarck was the master, this policy neutralized many Marxists who ended up normalizing themselves as the Social Democratic Party, which became the largest party in the Reichstag and even supportive of Germany\u2019s ill-fated involvement in the First World War. Political sociologists recall this episode as the paradigm case of co-option, the body politics\u2019 way of establishing equilibrium with a potentially lethal enemy by incorporating it as a kind of \u2018natural vaccination\u2019 (Michels 1911/1959).
