            "text": "It is well accepted that colostrum is an essential part of the newborn calf's diet. The primary reason for the benefits of colostrum is the passive transfer of maternal immunoglobulins to the newborn. In addition to immunoglobulins, colostrum and milk contain many other bioactive substances that are important for the development of the immune system and for fighting infections in the newborn (Shah, 2000). Lactoferrin (LF) is among these bioactive compounds. Lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein present in the colostrum and milk of most mammals (Masson and Heremans, 1971) and in many body secretions including bronchial mucus (Fahy et al., 1993) and tears (Kijlstra et al., 1983). Compared to other species, bovine milk and colostrum have relatively low concentrations of LF. Bovine colostrum contains approximately 2 mg of LF per milliliter (Tsuji et al., 1990), and mature milk contains 20 to 200 \n\u03bcg/ml (Masson and Heremans, 1971). Lactoferrin is also present at high concentrations (up to 100 mg/ml) in the mammary secretions of the nonlactating cow (Rejman et al., 1989). As an antimicrobial protein, LF produced by the mammary gland may serve a dual role protecting both the mammary gland and the neonatal intestine from infection.",

            "text": "Diarrhea is the most common ailment in young calves causing more than 52% of preweaning deaths (NAHMS, 1993). Diarrhea can be caused by a variety of bacteria or viruses, but the most common pathogens are enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium, and Salmonellae (Tromp, 1990). Studies have shown that LF has activity against at least two of these pathogens, E. coli (Teraguchi et al., 1994) and rotavirus (Superti et al., 1997). These data suggest that LF may prevent infection by these organisms in the calf. Evidence has shown that LF has bacteriostatic activity in vivo. Orally administered bovine LF suppresses the proliferation of intestinal E. coli in milk-fed mice (Teraguchi et al., 1994). If similar activity is observed in the gastrointestinal tract of young calves, there is potential for using LF as a preventative supplement to reduce the occurrence of disease or as a treatment for neonatal diarrhea.",

The iron saturation of the LF (Agri-Cell, Methuen, MA) was 13.2 mg/100 g. All calves received 2 L of good quality colostrum, tested by a colostrometer, within 3 h after birth, and another 2 L of good quality colostrum 8 to 12 h later. Calves were removed from their dam before the first colostrum feeding and placed in a naturally ventilated, enclosed calf room, in individual pens. Pens were bedded with kiln-dried sawdust. The calves remained in their pens for the duration of the study. On the day of birth, an initial BW was obtained before the second feeding of colostrum. On d 2, calves were fed a nonmedicated, all-milk protein milk replacer (Dairy Maid, Blue Seal Feeds, Londonderry, NH) in two feedings at 0700 and 1500 h. Beginning on d 2, every day each calf received 1.2% of its initial BW, in milk replacer powder. The milk replacer powder was divided into two equal portions, and each portion was reconstituted in 2 L of warm water immediately before feeding. Starting on d 3, and continuing until 14 d postweaning, calves had unlimited access to a nonmedicated starter (Calf Starter, Blue Seal Feeds) and fresh water. Starting on d 3, LF treatment was mixed with milk replacer and divided equally among the two feedings. Fresh starter and milk replacer were given to calves twice daily. Starter orts were collected and weighed daily. The starter consisted of steam-flaked corn, crimped oats, molasses, and pellets. Calves were weaned abruptly when they met the following four criteria: 1) minimum of 21 d old, 2) daily starter DMI was \u22651% of initial BW, for three consecutive days, 3) cumulative starter DMI was \u22659% of initial BW, and 4) weight gain was \u226512% of initial BW (Greenwood et al., 1997).

In the present study, preweaning fecal scores were the lowest for the calves fed 1 g/d LF and the highest for the control calves. Preweaning and total number of days medicated followed a similar response pattern. It has been demonstrated that LF has bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties that are effective against pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli (Dionysius et al., 1993; Teraguchi et al., 1994). More specifically, calves treated with a preparation containing LF and the lactoperoxidase system were able to survive a lethal intestinal infection of enterotoxigenic E. coli (Still et al., 1990). With E. coli being the principle pathogen responsible for neonatal calf diarrhea, supplemental LF may have reduced the establishment of E. coli in the gut of the calf, leading to reduced bouts of diarrhea. Similarly, LF has been shown to be effective against the diarrhea-causing pathogen, rotavirus (Superti et al., 1997). If calves in this study were exposed to rotavirus, then LF may have played a role in reducing the occurrence of infection by this virus.",

This finding is consistent with previous results from our laboratory, where calves fed 1 g/d of LF had lower numbers of days medicated than calves fed 0 or 10 g/d of LF (Joslin et al. 2002). However, in the previous study, this result was not significant, probably due to a small sample size. The results of these two studies make it apparent that the higher doses of LF are not as effective at reducing disease. Supplementing the milk replacer with 1 g/d of LF brought the total concentration of LF in the milk replacer to a concentration similar to that found in average bovine whole milk (250 mg/ml). The intestinal system of the newborn calf may be best adapted to utilizing this low level of LF to optimize health. Adding LF to milk replacer may be a way to make it more similar to milk, which may benefit the health of calves. It is clear from the results of this study that 1 g/d of supplemental LF improves health during the preweaning period. It should be noted here that the calves in this study were well-managed and generally healthy. The fact that LF improved the health of calves in a high-quality environment suggests that where conditions are less desirable, LF may be even more effective at improving health.",

In the present study, it is possible that the supplemental LF was acting as a growth factor in the small intestine of the calf.
