Viruses [canine distemper virus (CDV), feline coronavirus], bacteria (Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus species, Pasteurella, coliforms, Actinomyces, Nocardia species), fungi (Cryptococcus, Coccidioides species, Blastomyces, Histoplasma), rickettsiae (Ehrlichia, Rickettsia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), protozoa (Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum), parasites (Dirofilaria immitis, Cuterebra, Angiostrongylus vasorum) and algae (Prototheca wickerhamii, Prototheca zopfii) are known causes for meningomyelitis in dogs and cats, with or without concurrent intracranial signs (Griffin et al. 2008, Parry et al. 2009, Csebi et al. 2010, Dewey et al. 2016). Apart from infectious causes, non\u2010infectious meningoencephalomyelitis including granulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis, pyogranulomatous meningoencephalomyelitis and steroid\u2010responsive meningitis\u2010arteritis (SRMA) are described (Meric 1988, Griffin et al. 2008, Parry et al. 2009, Dewey et al. 2016). Current terminology implies that dogs clinically diagnosed with non\u2010infectious inflammatory myelitis without positive infectious disease testing, not classified as SRMA or eosinophilic meningomyelitis, and not histopathologically confirmed with alternative diagnoses are categorised as having meningoencephalomyelitis of unknown origin (MUO), equivalent to dogs diagnosed with meningoencephalitis of unknown origin. A clinical diagnosis of MUO is typically made by a combination of clinical presentation, MR imaging of involved part of the central nervous system (brain/spinal cord), and results of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (Griffin et al. 2008).",

            "text": "Currently, only one study has focused specifically on the clinical presentation, diagnostic findings and outcome in dogs with meningomyelitis caused by a variety of underlying aetiologies (Griffin et al. 2008). Of 28 cases included, 15 dogs were diagnosed with MUO. Clinical signs were reflected by the affected spinal cord segments, and younger dogs, toy breeds, and hound breeds were suggested to be predisposed for meningomyelitis. Although results of myelography, CT, and CT\u2010myelography have been reported, little is reported about magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in dogs with MUO of the spinal cord. The aims of this study were therefore to describe the signalment, clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, including results of MRI and long\u2010term survival in dogs diagnosed with presumptive MUO of the spinal cord without concurrent clinical signs of intracranial involvement.",

(2010), if they had (1) complete medical records available, (2) a complete neurological examination performed leading to a spinal cord localisation, (3) inflammatory CSF analysis, (4) MRI of the spinal cord and if (5) long\u2010term follow\u2010up information were available through revision of medical records or through contacting the referring veterinarian by telephone. Dogs were excluded if (1) the clinical records or imaging studies were incomplete or not available for review, (2) dogs showed clinical or neurological signs of intracranial involvement at time of presentation, (3) they had a peracute onset of clinical signs that were not progressive after 12 to 24 hours, (4) they had signs of extradural or extradural/intramedullary spinal cord compression on MRI and if (5) they had positive infectious disease titres or if clinical presentation, CSF analysis or necropsy findings were suggestive of SRMA or eosinophilic meningoencephalomyelitis (>10% eosinophils in CSF) (Dewey et al. 2016). Typical clinical presentation for SRMA was considered to be a dog less than 2 years of age of a typical breed (boxer, beagle, Bernese mountain dog, Nova Scotia duck tolling retriever, golden retriever, German shorthaired pointer) presenting with pyrexia and cervical hyperesthesia. CSF analysis in SRMA typically reveals a predominantly neutrophilic pleocytosis (Dewey et al. 2016). Dogs with histopathological confirmation of the disease [granulomatous meningo(encephalo)myelitis (GME) or necrotising meningo(encephalo)myelitis (NME) only needed to fulfil inclusion criteria (1) and (5). Information retrieved from the medical records included breed, gender, age at diagnosis, body weight, results of neurological examination including neuroanatomical localisation, duration of clinical signs prior to diagnosis, results of complete blood count (CBC) and biochemistry profile, results of CSF analysis including total nucleated cell count (TNCC), white blood cell differentiation and total protein (TP) concentration, treatment received and outcome. Duration of clinical signs prior to diagnosis (days) was classified as peracute (<2 days), acute (2 to 7 days) or chronic (>7 days). For dogs that had CSF analysis performed, site of collection (cisternal or lumbar), TNCC, TP and cytological differentiation were recorded. TNCC was considered normal if there were <5 cells/mm3. Protein concentration was considered normal for a cisternal collection if <0\u00b725 g/L and for a lumbar collection if <0\u00b74 g/L.",

Sequences varied, but included a minimum of T2\u2010weighted (T2W) [repetition time (ms) (TR)/echo time (ms) (TE), 3000/120] and T1\u2010weighted (T1W) (TR/TE, 400/8) images of the affected spinal cord region in a sagittal and transverse plane. The T1W images were acquired before and after intravenous (IV) administration of paramagnetic contrast medium with a dose of 0\u00b71 mg/kg gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem, Guerbet). If MR images of the brain were available, they were reviewed concurrently. Variables recorded were lesion \u00adintensity on T2W and T1W images, lesion localisation and distribution, lesion length and parenchymal and/or meningeal contrast enhancement. Lesion length was measured using Osirix Dicom viewer, and performed on sagittal T2W images for dogs that had focal lesions. Lesion length was measured twice, and the mean value reported. To compensate for differences in body size, values were corrected with respect to the length of vertebral body of C6 (for cervical lesions) or L2 (for thoracolumbar lesions). Vertebral body length was measured on T1W sagittal images.",
