Most common among these are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, C diff, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n[19]. Some of these pathogens are resistant to multiple antibiotics and antibiotic combinations, making prevention and infection control measures even more essential for the management of these HCAIs. Many resistant pathogens such as C diff inhabit the intensive care unit (ICU) environment [20]. Ventilation-associated pneumonias are also very common in ICUs leading to mortality rates of 9%\u201370% [21]. These factors lead to the increased cost of care because of prolonged hospitalization, intensive care admission, and treatment with newer and more complex antibiotic regimes. The incidence of HCAIs in ICU is significantly higher than for patients admitted to general inpatient wards [22]. Since imaging is often performed on multiple patients in ICU, in one general location, often with a single x-ray machine and digital cassette, heightened diligence is required to avoid the transmission of infectious agents [23].",

As discussed in this review article, there are multiple resources through which HCAIs can be acquired in the RD and numerous precautionary steps are required to avoid HCAIs in the RD. However, many deficiencies are still present in terms of readiness of HCWs in the RD for epidemics and emergent infections disease outbreaks. Future studies are required in infection control practices related to IR procedures including the use of prophylactic antibiotics. In addition, further research on the use of more advance radiological technologies, such as wireless and portable imaging machines, especially in ED and during epidemics are required to reduce the risk of HCAIs in the RD. Because RDs are exposed to both direct and indirect modes of HCAIs, it is prudent to investigate further to avoid the exposure to both patients as well as HCWs.",
