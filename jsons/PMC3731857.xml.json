In addition, the scans were interpreted as having one of five predominant radiographic abnormalities: Airspace consolidation, ground-glass opacities, tree-in-bud infiltrates, nodular infiltrates or reticular infiltrates. When more than one pattern was present in a chest CT, the pattern that was deemed most prevalent was chosen as the predominant pattern. Reticular and nodular infiltrates were grouped together as predominantly extra-alveolar findings.

Ground-glass opacification, which is defined by increased attenuation of the of the lung parenchyma but without obscuration of the vascular structures or of the air bronchograms seen in consolidating infiltrates,[20] may be due to infectious causes,[21] but may also be seen in interstitial lung disease with active inflammation.[22]",

Reticular infiltrates occur within the interlobular or intralobular septa and the bronchovascular interstitium. Nodular opacities may occur in any anatomic area of the lung, with common distributions including in the interlobar septa, centrilobular or in random distribution. The differential diagnosis for pulmonary nodules is broad and dependent on the distribution of nodules, but includes lymphangitic spread of malignancy, pneumoconiosis, infection and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.[18] Two possible reasons that this group of radiographic patterns may not be associated with a higher diagnostic yield would be the anatomic association with a process occurring outside of the airway or alveoli, and the likely higher prevalence of non-infectious causes in reticular and nodular infiltrates. Because not all patients in our study underwent high-resolution CT imaging, we were unable to further characterize the nodular infiltrates by area within the secondary pulmonary lobule or the reticular infiltrates as being smooth or nodular in appearance.",

While the volume of fluid returned is typically greater from the right middle lobe and lingula than from other lobes,[11] the increased volume did not correlate with a higher diagnostic yield in our patient population. This finding may reflect the evolving population of immunocompromised patients, and their infectious etiologies. During the era previous to anti-retroviral therapy, when patients with HIV were the predominant immunocompromised patients undergoing FOB with BAL, P. jirovecci infection was one of the dominant infectious etiologies diagnosed by BAL.[23] The majority of immunocompromised patients in this study undergoing FOB with BAL had either received hematopoietic stem cell tr ansplantation or were receiving chemotherapy, and the majority of our patients were not diagnosed with P. jirovecci pneumonia. Likewise, in the era before HIV, sensitive diagnostic studies such as PCR and GM antigen detection were not available. Given our higher prevalence of viral infections diagnosed on FOB with BAL, the finding of increased diagnostic yield when FOB with BAL was performed in the lower lobes could represent a greater affinity of viruses to involve the lower lobes preferentially, much as tuberculosis and P. jirovecci involve the upper lobes preferentially.[1324]",

Given the availability of these new diagnostic assays, we determined that studying the diagnostic yield of BAL alone in immunosuppressed patients would be clinically useful.",

First, the retrospective nature of the study resulted in a non-uniform protocol for diagnostic evaluation of patients and non-uniform patient selection criteria for undergoing FOB. Because of the common use of empiric antibiotics and anti-fungal agents in our cohort, diagnostic yield may have been limited in patients who were receiving antimicrobials at the time of FOB; likewise it is impossible to control for the duration of antibiotic therapy or of infiltrates prior to the procedure. Although FOB with BAL is performed in a standard manner by all members of this division, there was no protocol to ensure that every procedure was completed in exactly the same manner. Likewise, we were unable to control for variability of physicians in the interpretation of CT imaging.",
