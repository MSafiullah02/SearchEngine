This family includes 140 genera and about 3800 species distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the world (Ali et al., 2011). The genus Eucalyptus was described and named in 1788 by the French botanist l\u2019H\u00e9ritier. The name is generic, from the Greek words \u2018eu\u2019 (well) and \u2018kalyptos\u2019 (covered), because the flowers of various Eucalyptus species are protected by an operculum (Taoubi et al., 1997). The genus is indigenous to Australia and Tasmania, consists of over 800 species, spreading worldwide and successfully introducing due to its easy adaptability and fast growth (Coppen, 2002). As a consequence, Eucalyptus has become one of the world\u2019s most widely planted genera (Akin et al., 2010) and a plantation species in many parts of the world (Ames and Mathiews, 1968; Mubita et al., 2008).",

Leaves are grey-blue, alternate, drooping, 8\u201322 cm long, 1\u20132 cm wide, often curved or sickle shaped, tapering, and short pointed at base. Fruit is very small capsules at the end of thin stalks, 5\u20138 mm, valves 4, and containing minute seeds. Eucalyptus camaldulensis is an evergreen, perennial plant, and according to Jacobs (1955) it could reach ages of 500\u20131000 years. Commonly grows on riversides, whether of permanent or seasonal water (Brooker et al., 2002), generally dominate in the community, forming pure open forests or woodlands (Costermans, 1989).",

            "text": "As previously stated, E. camaldulensis plant is also known as red gum eucalyptus, murray red gum, and river red gum, because it produces red kino i.e. red gum, in significant amount. Thus besides different plant parts Aborigines used its secondary products as folk remedies. They made incisions in the tree trunks for obtaining the red kino and applied it directly to abrasions and cuts. Except fresh kino, the dried, dehydrated kino was prepared and used in the same way as fresh, but after softening in water (Williams, 2011; Clarke, 2014). Another significant folk remedy is young leaves which were used for smoke bath, where burning leaves smoke surrounds patient. The smoking medicine was used for fevers, colds, flu and general sickness (Williams, 2011; Pennacchio et al., 2010; Duke and Wain, 1981). Being useful for treating various health conditions, E. camaldulensis and its folk remedies then were transferred and introduced to other parts of the world, such as Africa. In Sudan the red kino was used for sore throat and diarrhea, while the smoke of burnt leaves was inhaled in case of respiratory problems. In Senegal for stomach-ache decoctions from leaves were prepared with sugar, while in Zimbabwe for cough, flu, and fever a decoction of E. camaldulensis leaves were combined with Citrus limon (L.) Burm. f. fruits and Psidium guajava L. leaves (Doran and Wongkaev, 2008; Maroyi, 2013). Further more, to prevent tooth decay and periodontitis in Nigeria teeth cleaning sticks were made from tree (Bukar et al., 2004), and in traditional medicine for healing wound infections, poultice of leaves containing eucalyptus oil have been used (Adeniyi et al., 2006).",

Its essential oils are reported to be anesthetic, antiseptic and astringent (Jeane et al., 2003; Kumar et al., 1988). In addition, a decoction of the leaves is reported to be a remedy for sore throat and other bacterial infections of the respiratory and urinary tracts (Bruneton, 1999). Due to numerous contemporary data regarding the antimicrobial activity of E. camaldulensis, this subject will be discussed in special section/chapter.",

Muell are reported to decrease gastric acid production and thus appear useful for the treatment of gastric ulcers (Adeniyi et al., 2006).

            "text": "The antioxidant effect represents one more useful E. camaldulensis characteristic. The free radical scavenging activities of the essential oils is assessed by measuring their scavenging abilities for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals. The scavenging activity for the Eucalyptus camaldulensis was characterized as high (81.9%) (Ghaffar et al., 2015). The results of E. camaldulensis EO antioxidant effect evaluation indicated that the EO had high potent ferrous ions chelating and total antioxidant activities comparing to ascorbic acid and BHT (El-Baz et al., 2015). Also, the E. camaldulensis var. brevirostris leaves ethanol extract possessed antioxidant activity, where the prevailing antioxidants in the extract were gallic and ellagic acid (El-Ghorab et al., 2003). There are several more studies dealing with antioxidant activity of E. camaldulensis (Barra et al., 2010; Salem et al., 2015; Siramon and Ohtani, 2007; Olawore and Ololade, 2017), but it is interesting to mention here that E. camaldulensis flower EO inhibited melanogenesis through its antioxidant properties and by down-regulating both mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathways. This study indicated that the essential oil has the potential to be developed into a skin care product (Huang et al., 2015). Thus, except the medical application, E. camaldulensis extracts are also currently used in cosmetic formulations, and leaf extracts have been approved as food additives (Takahashi et al., 2004). Also, essential oils and their constituents have been used as flavoring agents in the formulation of different pharmaceutical products, cosmetics, and food industry (Cowan, 1999). Except this, E. camaldulensis PEx and EOs have the potential to be used as antibacterial and antifungal agents in cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. It is interesting to mention here the activity of E. camaldulensis EOs (2\u20138 mg/mL) on dental biofilm formation in vivo where detected inhibition was 14.5\u201339.2% after four weeks, comparing to chlorhexidine (2 mg/mL), which inhibited maximum 13.9% of dental biofilm formation (Rasooli et al., 2009). Extracts and essential oils of this aromatic plant can be used as food preservatives in order to reduce the dependency on synthetic chemicals in food preservation. In Australia, it is also used as sources of wild honey, providing bees with good quality pollens and heavy yields of nectar (Boland et al., 1984). Moreover, in industry, the wood of E. camaldulensis has been used for heavy construction, railway sleepers, flooring, framing, fencing, plywood, and veneer manufacture, wood turning, firewood, and charcoal production (Boland et al., 1984). Eucalyptus camaldulensis wood burns well and make a good fuel, also its dense wood and coppicing ability make it an excellent species for fuelwood production used in several countries such as Brazil (Jacobs, 1981; Eldridge et al., 1993). Furthermore, Eucalyptus biomass residues from agro-forest and pulping industries represent a valuable source of high-value compounds such as triterpenic compounds (Domingues et al., 2011; Ferreira et al., 2018).",

Beside the beneficial effects, essential oils and plant extracts can exert potentially unfavorable effects as complex mixtures of different compounds. A risk assessment of their hazard is always necessary before commercialization, so the estimation of EOs toxicity has been already conducted resulting in human oral and dermal dose limit recommendations. For most EOs the recommended dose is in range 1\u20134%, but for cineole-rich Eucalyptus sp. EOs, including E. camaldulensis, the limit dose is 10%, indicating a generally low application risk (Lis-Balchin, 2006).

The yields of E. camaldulensis leaves EO (0.90\u20130.98%) originating from Pakistan and Morocco were similar (Ashraf et al., 2010; Farah et al., 2002), while Moudachirou et al. (1999) reported a variable oil content of 0.6\u20131.4% from different locations of Benin. The oil yield of E. camaldulensis from Jerusalem was 0.5% (Chalchat et al., 2000) and significantly higher oil yield was reported for E. camaldulensis from Taiwan: 2.3\u20133.0% with respect to different seasons (Shieh, 1996). Similar EOs yield (0.77\u20132.53%) has been reported for E. globulus, as one of the economically important plants for essential oil production (Joshi, 2012; Selvakumar et al., 2012; Harkat-Madouri et al., 2015). The reported essential oil yield for other Eucalyptus species is slightly higher, ranging from 1.2% to 3% (w/w): the highest yield was obtained from E. cinerea F. Muell. ex Benth and E. sideroxylon A. Cunn. ex Woolls (3.0%), followed by E. lehmannii (Schauer) Benth. (2.8%), E. bicostata Maiden, Blakely & J.H.Simmonds (2.0%), E. leucoxylon F. Muell (1.6%), E. maidenii F.Muell. (1.5%), and E. astringens Maiden (1.2%) (Sebei et al., 2015).",

In E. camaldulensis oil, monoterpenes were prevalent (34.6\u201356.3% for all seasons) while sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (6.6\u201316.5%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes (2.1\u201311.1%) were present in less extent. Eucalyptus astringens oil had resembling chemical characteristic to E. camaldulensis oil, the abundant quantity of monoterpenes, which represented more than 50% of the total oil amounts for the all seasons (53.4\u201363.6 %). Similarlly, E. leucoxylon essential oil, contained mainly oxygenated monoterpenes with a prevalence of 1,8 cineole (13.1\u201317.6%), such as in E. camaldulensis oil (15.5\u201320.6%).

            "text": "The variations in the chemical composition of eucalyptus EOs with respect to seasons have also been reported (Tsiri et al., 2003), but the most commonly detected as major components in the eucalyptus essential oil are 1,8-cineole, \u03b2-pinene, \u03b3-terpinene, and p-cymene. It is important to emphasize here that according to chemical composition the Eucalyptus camaldulensis EO generally can be divided in two different types. Type I is a cineole-rich essential oil containing 80\u201390% 1,8-cineole plus pinene, and Type II is a cineole-poor essential oil, containing significantly less cineol (Williams, 2011). Plant genotype is important factor influencing the final chemical composition of EO (Djilani and Dicko, 2012). Due to genetic and epigenetic factors same plant species can produce a similar EO, but with different chemical composition and therapeutic activities. Brophy and Southwell (2002) examined essential oils of two variations, Eucalyptus camaledulensis var. camaldulensis and Eucalyptus camaledulensis var. obtuse, and the main compounds of Eucalyptus camaledulensis var. camaldulensis were p-cymene (22%), cryptone (14%), and spathulenol (17%), while Eucalyptus camaledulensis var. obtusa had different main compounds: 1,8-cinole (52%), \u03b1-pinene (15%), and aromadendrene (3%), suggesting that these subspecies belong to different types of eucalyptus essential oils. The content of 1,8-cineole was also variable but in the same range for essential oils reported from Greece (25.3\u201344.2%) (Tsiri et al., 2003), Pakistan (34.4\u201340.0%) (Ashraf et al., 2010), Mozambique (37.1\u201340.0%) (Pegula et al., 2000), Nigeria (32.8\u201370.4%) (Oyedeji et al., 1999), and Taiwan (34.0\u201368.2%) (Shieh, 1996). Similarly, the major component of Eucalyptus camaldulensis oils originating form Burundi, Morocco, and Benin was 1,8-cineole ranging from 31.0 to 72.5% with no presence of cryptone (Dethier et al., 1994; Zrira and Benjilali, 1991; Zrira et al., 1992; Moudachirou et al., 1999). Cryptone has been shown to be present in low-cineole varieties of EOs from Australia (Bignell et al., 1996), Uruguay (Dellacassa et al., 1990) and South Florida (Pappas and Sheppard-Hanger, 2000). For example, the major constituents identified in the essential oil from South Florida included p-cymene (35.0%), cryptone (13.7%), terpinen-4-ol (5.7%), spathulenol (4.3%), and cuminaldehyde (3.7%), with a very low amount of 1,8-cineole (2.7%) (Pappas and Sheppard-Hanger, 2000).",

(2001) analyzed the immature flowers and calli grown in Athens (Greece), and they found that the main monoterpenes produced in E. camaldulensis calli, cultured in darkness and under light conditions, were 1,8-cineole, 62.70 and 69.26% as well as \u03b2-pinene, 27.09 and 25.31%, respectively. In lower amounts \u03b1-pinene (1.2 and 1.1%, respectively) and the terpenoids, camphene, myrcene, isocineole, myrtenol, bicyclogermacrene, spathulenol, and trans-pinocarveol were present (less than 1%). Apart from isocineole, these constituents were also determined in the essential oil from immature flowers. This is remarkable because Giamakis et al. (2001) showed that undifferentiated calli are capable of producing high amounts of monoterpenoid compounds (approx. one third of that produced by the explant). This makes immature flowers from E. camaldulensis an interesting candidate for the development of calli able to produce high percentages of these two important monoterpenes, 1,8-cineole and \u03b2-pinene (Giamakis et al., 2001). Also, the influence of light conditions on essential oil chemical composition showed that light conditions did not considerably affect the production of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes compounds by calli developed from immature flowers (Giamakis et al., 2001).",

Quality and quantity of the extracts dependent of the target compound structures, natural sources, and type of processes (Karacabey et al., 2013), explaining the different phenolic composition in the extracts obtained with different procedures. The most commonly plant extract have been obtained by conventional solvent extraction methods (infusion, decoction, digestion, maceration, and percolation) (Azwanida, 2015) using solvents such as water, ethanol, methanol, chloroform, dimethyl-sulfoxide etc. However, these techniques are demanding regarding the extraction process duration, organic solvent consumption, and lack of extraction automation. The potential and powerful alternative to conventional liquid solvent extraction methods are Ultrasonic-Assisted Extraction (UAE) and Microwave-Assisted Extraction (MAE), especially in the case of plant material (Hao et al., 2002; Eskilsson and Bjrklund, 2000). Interest in MAE has increased significantly over the past 5\u201310 years in particular medicinal plant research, as a result of its inherent advantages as special heating mechanism, moderate capital cost, and its good performance under atmospheric conditions (Ballard et al., 2010; Chan et al., 2011). In addition, MAE technique possesses many advantages compared with other methods for the extraction of compounds such as bioactive compounds (Sanchez-Aldana et al., 2013) saving in processing time and solvent, higher extraction rate, better products with lower cost, reduced energy consumption (up to 85-fold savings), and waste generation (Yan et al., 2010; Yemis and Mazza, 2012). This is confirmed for E. camaldulensis extraction of phenolic and flavonoid compounds, where the compounds were extracted with MAE for 5 min which was equivalent with UAE (60 min) and traditional extraction (24 h) methods (Gharekhani et al., 2012).",

Crude methanol leaf extracts of E. camaldulensis from Iran had saponins, tannins, volatile oils, and balsam (gum), while the components such as anthraquinones, hydrolysable tannin, flavonoid, alkaloid, and glycosides were not detected (Jouki and Khazaei, 2010); crude methanolic leaves extract of E. camaldulensis from India contained anthraquinones, flavonoids, saponins, and terpenoids, while alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, and tannins were not detected (Singh and Thakur, 2016). Phytochemical screening of the crude stem barks methanol extract of E. camaldulensis from Bangladesh indicated presence of saponins, flavonoids, tannins, and also volatile oils, while anthraquinones, hydrolysable tannins, alkaloids, and glycosides were not present (Islam et al., 2014).

Beside S. aureus, antibacterial effect was confirmed against B. subtilis (0.17\u20130.34%), M. luteus (0.2\u20130.4%), and S. pyogenes (0.4\u20131.1%) (Rasooli et al., 2009; Akin et al., 2010; Knezevic et al., 2016; Khubeiz et al., 2016; Reda et al., 2017; Ostad Asiaei et al., 2018). Activity of EOs was examined aginst L. monocytogenes in only one study and MIC was not obtained with the highest used concentration of 1.0%, and the same was reported for Enterococcus durans (Akin et al., 2010).",

Inhibitory concentrations varied depending on extraction method, plant properties, and model organism, being in broad range from 0.08 \u03bcg/mL to 200 mg/mL. Crude aqueous leaf extracts show lower activity against various bacteria (range 25\u201350 mg/mL) (Abubakar, 2010), while bark aqueous extracts were more effective, with MIC from 0.1 mg/mL for Propionobacterium acnes to 4.0 mg/mL for P. aeruginosa (Mabona et al., 2013). The antimicrobial activity of methanol, ethanol or petroleum leaf extracts of E. camaldulensis showed significant variation; for instance, MICs against B. subtilis varied from 0.04 up to 200 mg/mL or against S. aureus 1.25\u201325 mg/mL (Chuku et al., 2016; Ayepola and Adeniyi, 2008). For most examined Gram negative bacteria MICs were in range 10\u2013200 mg/mL, while P. aeruginosa was even more susceptible (MICs 10\u2013100 mg/mL). Similar or better antibacterial effect showed acetone leaf extract, being active against examined bacteria in range 15\u201350 mg/mL.

Interestingly, generally highly resistant M. tuberculosis was sensitive to methanol, n-hexane or chloroform extract with MICs in range 0.004\u20130.064 mg/mL, while M. bovis was slightly less sensitive with MICs 0.01\u20130.05 mg/mL (Lawal et al., 2012; Gemechu et al., 2013).",

The knowledge about the essential oils and their target(s) on bacterial cell is crucial to understand which parts of bacterial cell are affected. The essential oils antibacterial action is linked to oil hydrophobicity that increases cell permeability and consequent leakage of cell constituents (Dorman and Deans, 2000; Lambert et al., 2001; Helander et al., 1998; Turgis et al., 2009; Ultee et al., 2002; Faleiro, 2011). It is important to perceive that a disturbed cell structures may affect stability of other cellular structures in a cascade type of action (Carson et al., 2002). Essential oils have several target sites on bacterial cells; however it seems that all are directly or indirectly connected to the primary effect of essential oils on the bacterial envelopes. First of all, EOs may cause cell wall and membrane disturbance (Lambert et al., 2001; Oussalah et al., 2006), which further can lead to the significant loss of intracellular ATP (Oussalah et al., 2006; Turgis et al., 2009), induction the synthesis of heat shock proteins (Burt et al., 2007), pH disturbance (Turgis et al., 2009; Oussalah et al., 2006), and intracytoplasmic changes (e.g. coagulation, periplasmic space enlargement) (Becerril et al., 2007). Although the number of studies dealing with the EO mechanisms of action is increasing, there are still many questions to be answered before the precise mechanism is revealed. This is at the same time one of the main limitations for EOs and extracts wide usage as antimicrobials. Thus, the so far knowledge must be further improved enabling the combat bacterial pathogens and its resistance.",

This system of intercellular communication, quorum sensing (QS), is based on production of the signal molecules, called autoinducers (Abraham et al., 2011). This communication system is relative to cell density and some compounds interfere with the QS communication system and attenuating the bacterial pathogenicity, in the phenomenon known as anti-QS compounds (Abraham et al., 2011). There are reports of anti-QS activity of various plants species EOs from genus Eucalyptus, such as Eucalyptus globulus L. (Lu\u00eds et al., 2016; Cervantes-Ceballos et al., 2015), Eucalyptus radiata D. (Lu\u00eds et al., 2016), Eucalyptus citriodora Hook., Eucalyptus smithii R. T. Baker and Eucalyptus staigeriana F. Muell. ex Bailey (Lu\u00eds et al., 2016). Unfortunately, there is still no data regarding E. camaldulensis anti-QS activity.",

This fungus is usually related to tropic and subtropic regions, affecting the respiratory and nervous systems of the immunocompetent humans and domestic animals (Sorrell et al., 1996; Chakrabarti et al., 1997; Bielska and May, 2016; Roe et al., 2018). Similarily, C. neoformans var. grubii can be isolated from flowers and bark of E. camaldulensis (Gugnani et al., 2005). According to the literature, E. camaldulensis is natural reservoir of Cryptococcus and is considered responsible for occurring cryptococcosis worldwide. In this context, it is interesting to observe that C. neoformans is moderately sensitive to E. citriodora Hook EOs, with MIC90 0.5% (wt/v) (Pattnaik et al., 1996; Luqman et al., 2008) or E. globulus Labill. with MIC 0.13% (wt/v) (Suliman et al., 2010).

Despite the recent significant progress in antiviral drug development, viral infections are considered as one of the major causes of death worldwide (M\u00fcller et al., 2007; Meyers et al., 1982). Thus, novel natural antiviral agents need to be found urgently. Many natural products possess antiviral activity and some of them are already in use for treatment of human viral infections with both RNA and DNA viruses (e.g. myricetin against coronavirus, linalool, urosolic acid, and apigenin against coxsackievirus, quercetin and narasin against denge virus, curcumin against hepatitis B and C virus) (Lin et al., 2014; Kitazato et al., 2007). Numerous secondary plant metabolites such as essential oils, flavonoids, saponins, tannins, alkaloids, lignans, terpenes, and phenolic acids express significant antiviral activity against different viruses (Jassim and Naji, 2003; Chiang et al., 2003; Sanchez Palomino et al., 2002). Recently few studies confirmed the E. camaldulensis EOs and plant extracts antiviral activity (Table 4).",

            "text": "Despite the fact that many plant extracts and essential oils were previously reported for their antiviral activities, the mechanism of action still remains poorly understood. There are many factors that influencing the EOs mode of action, which should be taken in consideration when antiviral activity of plant antimicrobials is examined. One of such factors is the difference between enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, because the observed antiviral effect has usually been greater for enveloped viruses (Yamada et al., 2009; Siddiqui et al., 1996). In majority of the studies dealing with antiviral mode of action, the focus has been on either the inhibition of viral adsorption to host cells or examination of the plant antimicrobials effectiveness against intracellular virus multiplication (Gilling et al., 2014). So, most commonly described modes of antiviral actions are virus inactivation and the impaired virus adsorption to host cells, which is often difficult to distinguish. Like in other antimicrobial modes of action, antiviral mechanism is also dependent on EOs or extracts compounds activity. This is one more factor that should be considered, because it affects the final antiviral mechanism of action. For some compounds the potential mechanism is reported, i.e. carvacrol acts directly upon the virus capsid and subsequently the nucleic acid (Gilling et al., 2014). When EOs antiviral mechanism of action is considered, EOs may cause the loss of the viral capsid integrity, ultimately leading to exposure of the viral genome. In addition, some EOs subsequently act directly upon the viral nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). According to one study, E. camaldulensis EOs may be promising antiviral agent against RNA viruses with no effect against DNA virus (El-Baz et al., 2015). Also, with shorter periods of exposure to the antimicrobial, the virus is able to adsorb specifically to host cells; however, it may or may not be able to cause successful infection depending upon the integrity of the viral genome. On the other hand, after exposure to some EOs virus capsid and genome remains intact. These antimicrobials appear to exert their antiviral effect by coating the capsid and thereby preventing specific adsorption of the virus to host cells (Gilling et al., 2014). Although, there are still no reports regarding E. camaldulensis EOs antiviral mode of action, there are some promising results about its antiviral effect (Table 4). These promising results represent foundation for further research and potential application of E. camalulensis EOs as potent antiviral agent.",

The essential oils were found to possess antitrypanosomal activity in vitro in a dose-dependent manner in a short time. The decrease of Trypanosoma evansi number over time was achieved in doses of 400 mg/mL for 3 min, 200 mg/mL for 4 min, and 100 mg/mL for 15 min. Against Trypanosoma brucei brucei EOs was more potent in the concentration of 400 mg/mL, decreasing the number of parasite for 3 min, 200 mg/mL for 4 min, and 100 mg/mL for 11 min (Habila et al., 2010). Such prompt decrease in parasite number in the in vitro tests for both Trypanosoma brucei brucei and T. evansisuggests that the EOs kill the parasites efficiently, but by an unknown mechanism. There are suggestions of some potential mechanisms of antiprotozoal EOs action. The activity of EOs could be due to the hydrophobic nature of the cyclic hydrocarbons, which allow EOs to interact with the protozoans causing conformational changes in the parasite membrane structure, resulting in the loss of membrane stability (Calsamiglia et al., 2007). The essential oils also can act by inhibiting some key enzymes in the parasite glycolytic pathway (Smith-Palmer et al., 2004). Furthermore, some EOs components inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity and act on other vulnerable sites, such as cytochrome p450 (Maciel et al., 2010). This multicomponent nature of plant EOs is an advantage for several target sites on protozoans, which is of great importance.",

The main strategy represents finding new antimicrobial agents; however another strategy goes in the direction of reducing degree of bacterial resistance and/or bacterial re-sensitization to conventional antibiotics. This can be achieved using combined therapies. The most of the tested combinations are dual combinations, but the combinations of three, four or more agents also can be efficient (Lesjak et al., 2016). This is in line with antimicrobial efficiency and potential of EOs and plant extracts which are complex mixtures of numerous compounds. Combination strategy could be very promising regarding the diversity of agents that could be tested: (1) conventional non-antimicrobial agent (e.g. anti-inflammatory or anti-psychotic drug) + conventional antimicrobial agent (antibiotic); (2) conventional antimicrobial agent (antibiotic) + natural antimicrobial agent (essential oil, plant extract, bacteriophage, antimicrobial peptide ect.); (3) conventional antimicrobial agent (antibiotic) + single compound isolated from natural antimicrobial agent (with previously confirmed antimicrobial activity); (4) combination of two or more single compounds isolated from natural antimicrobial agents (with previously confirmed antimicrobial activity).",

Except antibacterial activity, other activities of E. camaldulensis extracts in combination were detected and characterized as efficient. Antiviral activity was confirmed for the combination of E. camaldulensis 80% methanol leaves extract and acyclovir against herpes simplex virus -1 and -2 and varicella-zoster virus (Abu-Jafar and Huleihel, 2017). Similaily, the combination of Annona senegalensis L. leaf methanol extract and E. camaldulensis extract efficiently cured in vivo albino mice infection with parasite Trypanosoma brucei brucei (Lafia strain) (Kabiru et al., 2012). All these data are very promising, but the methods used in different studies and results interpretation vary (Table 5). As a consequence, the data should be taken with precautions, as can not be compared and properly discussed. To avoid this problem, the testing combinations of different agents should be conducted using standardized methods, such as time-kill method (CLSI, 1999; Verma, 2007), checkerboard method (Verma, 2007; EUCAST, 2000), Chou-Talalay method (Chou, 2010) or Boik method (Boik, 2010). All these methods possess some shortfalls, such as time-consuming, labor-intensive, limitations regarding the number of the agents in combination, etc. Unfortunately, there is no one gold standard for synergy testing and prior the further application of different phytochemicals, this issue should be overcome.",
