There are no approved drugs or vaccines yet available against SARS-CoV-2. Material and methods: State-of-the-art tools based on in-silico methods are a cost-effective initial approach for identifying appropriate ligands against SARS-CoV-2. The present study developed the 3D structure of the envelope and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular docking analysis was done against various ligands. Results: The highest log octanol/water partition coefficient, high number of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, lowest non-bonded interaction energy between the receptor and the ligand, and high binding affinity were considered for the best ligand for the envelope (mycophenolic acid: log P = 3.00; \u0394G = -10.2567 kcal/mol; pKi = 7.713 \u03bcM) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (1-[(2,4-dichlorophenyl)methyl]pyrazole-3,5-dicarboxylic acid: log P = 2.901; \u0394G = -12.2112 kcal/mol; pKi = 7.885 \u03bcM) of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: The study identifies the most potent compounds against the SARS-CoV-2 envelope and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein through state-ofthe-art tools based on an in-silico approach. A combination of these two ligands could be the best option to consider for further detailed studies to develop a drug for treating patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19.",

COVID-19 patients were reported with a cluster of acute respiratory illness and higher interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 (MIP1A), and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in plasma [1, 2] . It was caused by an unknown beta coronavirus, initially called as 2019-nCoV; later the unknown beta coronavirus was named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which formed a clade within the subgenus Sarbecovirus [2, 3] . Apart from the well-known MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), the SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the coronavirus family that infects humans [4] . The genome of SARS-CoV-2 has 89% and 82% nucleotide similarity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and of human SARS-CoV, respectively. The phylogenetic trees of spike, membrane, envelope, orf1a/b, and nucleoprotein from SARS-CoV-2 are clustered closely with those of the bat, civet, and human SARS-CoV. The external subdomain of the spike's receptor of SARS-CoV-2 has 40% amino acid similarity with other SARS-related CoV [5] . The entire orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 encodes a novel short protein. Moreover, new orf8 of SARS-CoV-2 probably encodes a secreted protein with an \u03b1-helix, a \u03b2-sheet(s) having six strands [5] . The phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that WH-Human-1 coronavirus (WHCV) or SARS-CoV-2 was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that were previously sampled from bats in China and that have a history of genomic recombination [6] . A recent study confirmed that the SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 cell entry receptor, similar to SARS-CoV [7] .",

The 3D models of the envelope protein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 were predicted, validated, and used for docking studies. The docking studies help in the prediction of the preferred orientation of a ligand with the binding site on a protein and are used for conformation of various chemical compounds at the target site of the protein.

The WHO recommendation for the management of MERS-CoV is being in practice: initiation of oxygen therapy to keep the oxygen saturation above 90%, with conservative fluid management in the absence of shock, and an empiric antimicrobial regimen that includes antibiotics and a neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of influenza. All of those supportive treatments are for the prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome and for the prevention septic shock [2, 3, 36] . Hence, drug development against SARS-CoV-2 is considered urgent in order to fight COVID-19.
