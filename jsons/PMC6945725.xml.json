HAIs are burdensome to patients, complicate treatment, prolong hospital length-of-stay, induce resistance of microorganisms to antimicrobials, raise healthcare costs, and can be life-threatening [1\u20135]. In 2011, the estimated prevalence of HAIs in European acute care hospitals was 5.7%, affecting approximately 3.2 million patients [6]. The most commonly reported infection types were respiratory tract infections (23.5%), surgical site infections (19.6%), urinary tract infections (19%), bloodstream infections (10.7%), and gastro-intestinal infections (7.7%), of which 48% were Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) [6]. Hospital surveillance in the Netherlands showed a decreasing prevalence of HAIs from 7.2% in 2008 [7] to 5.0% in 2017 [8]. Despite this decrease, point prevalence of HAIs varies considerably between Dutch hospitals, ranging from 1.5 to 6.5% [8]. The distribution of hospitals, the severity of patient case mix or infection types did not seem to explain the differences between the hospitals [8].",

Most strategies focus on a core set of recommended prevention practices, based on guidelines from numerous professional organizations and government agencies [14\u201317]. The extent to which these practices are adopted by Dutch hospitals is unknown.

The instrument contained questions about general hospital characteristics (e.g. number of beds), general infection prevention policies (e.g. presence of guidelines and surveillance systems), staffing of the infection control program, and use of specific practices related to the prevention and monitoring of CAUTI, CLABSI, VAP, and CDI. The survey instrument was forward-backward translated into Dutch by the research team with support of a bilingual translator and digitalized afterwards with LimeSurvey. Some questions were slightly modified to fit the Dutch context. These questions mainly related to hospital characteristics, job functions, and organizational structure. As in the original survey instrument, respondents were asked to indicate the frequency of use for certain infection prevention practices on a scale from 1 (never use) to 5 (always use). The survey instrument was pilot tested by five infection preventionists from five different hospitals, recruited via the Dutch Association for Hygiene & Infection Prevention in Healthcare, to ensure the validity, reliability, and acceptability of the survey. No changes were made after pilot testing (see Additional file 1).",

The number of hospitals that regularly use urinary catheter reminders or stop-orders and/or nurse initiated catheter discontinuation to prompt timely catheter removal is much lower (62%) than a similar process for CLABSI prevention involving the use of daily checks for whether a central line is still indicated (90%). A major difference between the prevention of CAUTI and CLABSI is that the majority of patients with central lines are admitted to an ICU. Implementing urinary catheter reminders or stop-orders hospital-wide is generally more challenging than within a specific ward. Institutional use of CAUTI prevention practices may be achieved through a hospital-wide approach focused on implementing a bundle of CAUTI preventive practices [30, 31].",

This may be a reason why we observed rare use of routine central line changes in Dutch hospitals. In the Netherlands, monitoring of CLABSI is facilitated by a well-established nationwide surveillance system [32], using strict criteria for assessing CLABSI based on the definitions from the European Centre for Disease Control [33]. Since 2009, CLABSI incidence in ICUs decreased from 4.3/1000 central line days to 1.2/1000 central line days in 2016 [34, 35]. It is likely that the national patient safety program \u2018Prevent harm, work safely\u2019 has contributed to this decline. A key focus of this five-year programme (2008\u20132012) was on the implementation of a central-line insertion and maintenance bundle [36]. The programme demonstrated that the compliance rate for the bundle element \u2018Daily check whether the central line is still indicated\u2019, increased from 60% to \u226580% in 2014 [37]. A recent meta-analysis by Ista and colleagues showed that the incidence of CLABSI decreased significantly after the implementation of central-line bundles, from 6.4/1000 catheter days to 2.5/ 1000 catheter days [38]. A significant proportion of patients with a central venous catheter are admitted to an ICU, and many CLABSI prevention practices have primarily been implemented in ICUs. This is reflected in the Dutch surveillance data of CLABSI incidence in non-ICUs. Between 2009 and 2016, only a small decrease in CLABSI incidence occurred within non-ICUs (from 3.5/1000 line days to 3.3/1000 line days) [34, 35]. This finding underscores the importance of also effectively implementing CLABSI infection practices outside of the ICU setting.",

This is probably due to the ongoing debate about which definition and criteria should be used for this complication [39, 40]. While the diagnosis of VAP is usually made on clinical, microbiological and radiological criteria, low interrater reliability and poor correlation with histopathology have been described [39, 41]. A meta-analysis of three Dutch studies on the effects of systemic antibiotics for selective digestive tract decontamination and oropharyngeal decontamination showed that both practices reduce ICU mortality and ICU-acquired Gram-negative bacteraemia, without increasing antibiotic resistance [42, 43]. Based upon these findings, the use of systemic antibiotics for selective digestive tract decontamination and oropharyngeal decontamination in patients with an expected length of ICU stay of more than 48 h was included in the Dutch antibiotic policy guidelines. The results of our study reflect the broad implementation of these policy guidelines. Selective decontamination strategies for preventing VAP were used in 84% of the hospitals and almost two-thirds of Dutch hospitals reported using systemic antibiotics for selective digestive tract decontamination and oropharyngeal decontamination. However, in all Dutch studies on selective digestive tract decontamination in the ICU, evaluation of VAP was performed in a research setting [43]. The remaining VAP prevention practices were only moderately implemented, perhaps as a result of the focus on selective decontamination strategies.",

Nevertheless, the characteristics of the non-responding hospitals were comparable to those of the 47 hospitals (65%) that participated in our study. We therefore believe that our results generally reflect the use of infection prevention practices by Dutch hospitals. Second, we used self-reported data of infection control professionals. Our findings on some infection prevention practices could be inaccurate if the respondent was not sufficiently aware of all actual practices. An individual respondent may have overestimated or underestimated how frequently the various practices were used [48]. However, we have thoroughly instructed respondents - both verbally and in writing - to consult a colleague if certain infection prevention practices were beyond their scope of attention. We therefore have no reason to believe that systematic inaccuracies have occurred. Still, we cannot rule out potential response bias (e.g. recall, social-desirability) and acknowledge that respondent answers may not correlate perfectly with the actual day-to-day reality of their respective hospital. Third, as our intent was to present a cross-sectional snapshot of infection prevention in Dutch hospitals, our analyses are limited to univariate analyses. As a consequence, inferences regarding the determinants of regular use of the infection prevention practices are not provided. Finally, although we collected a considerable amount of information about the use of infection prevention practices, we do not have data on actual infection rates. As a consequence we were not able to present relationships between the use of the various infection prevention practices and infection outcomes. Nevertheless, research has shown that most of the infection prevention practices included in our study contribute substantially to reducing HAIs; such practices are generally included in published national and international guidelines.",

These strategies could include engaging in large-scale collaborative networks that focus attention on HAI prevention and provide guidance and implementation tools to hospitals that may be struggling [49].
