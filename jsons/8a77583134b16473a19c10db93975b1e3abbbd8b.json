This mussel is reported to live in the region ranging from intertidal to shallow subtidal zones at the depth of approximately 30 m, and it is tolerant of low salinity and low oxygen levels during its life span of ca. two years (http://www. exoticsguide.org/musculista_senhousia). The outside shell of M. senhousei is smooth and shiny with a yellow-green color and can grow to a maximum length of 35 mm, while its interior is purplish-gray. Analyses of the habitat and growth conditions indicate that M. senhousei is a passive filter-feeding shellfish. Thus, in addition to a small number of protozoa, the main component of its food is diatoms, which belong to 20 different genera [2] .",

In our continuous search for anti-influenza A viral compounds from natural sources [4] [5] [6] using the H5N1 pseudo-typed virus screening approach, we identified the traditional Chinese seafood M. senhousei as showing a good inhibitory activity toward influenza A virus (IAV). The preliminary mechanistic study indicated that the antiviral activity of this food resulted from the inhibition of virus entry during early infection. We then investigated the bioactive components of this mussel using a bioassay-guided approach, from which a porphyrin derivative named pyropheophorbide a (PPa) that showed significant anti-IAV activity in vitro was isolated and identified, indicating a potential application of this molecule in the development of new antiviral agents.",

After extensive rinses with PBS to remove the unbound PPa, the PPa absorbed on lipid or cells was then extracted with methanol, and the fluorescence intensity was subsequently measured at the excitation wavelength of 365 nm. As shown in Fig. 4c , an intense fluorescence emission of PPa at a wavelength of ca. 666 nm was observed from lipid extracts (60% remaining) and cell extracts (38% remaining), indicating a strong binding affinity of PPa for the lipid bilayer. Fig. 3 . a Cytopathic effects (CPE) on MDCK cells infected with influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (100 TCID 50 ). Four different drug administration protocols were employed to treat the virus or cells at the concentration of 5 \u03bcg/mL of PPa. Phase contrast images were obtained using a microscope at 48 h post-infection. 3b Timeof-addition assay. MDCK cells infected with A/PR/8/34(H1N1) (100 TCID 50 ) were treated with 5 \u03bcg/mL PPa at the indicated time intervals. The virus titer was determined by measuring the TCID 50 of virus in the supernatant at 48 h post-infection; *p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001. 3c Hemagglutinin inhibition assay designed to measure the inhibitory effect of PPa on the binding of the virus to target cells. An equal volume of influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1) virus (4HAU) was transferred to a microwell plate containing two-fold serially diluted PPa in PBS. Then, erythrocytes (1% v/v in saline) were added to each well. After an incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the hemagglutination reaction was analyzed. PBS without virus served as a positive control, while virus served as the negative control. 3d Hemolysis inhibition assay. A suspension of freshly prepared chicken erythrocytes (2%) was added to the mixture of PPa (15 \u03bcg/mL) with the influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) in allantoic fluid. The mixture was then acidified to a pH ranging from 4.6 to 6.0 (sodium acetate, 0.5 M), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. At the end of the incubation, the mixture was centrifuged and the absorbance of the supernatants containing released hemoglobin was measured at OD 535 using a Multiskan FC microplate reader. 3e Neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay. A reaction mixture consisting of PPa and influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/ 34(H1N1) virus in MES buffer was incubated for 45 min. Afterwards, 4-MU-NANA was added to each well, the mixture was incubated for another 1 h, and the reaction was terminated with NaOH (83% ethanol). Finally, an excitation wavelength of 340 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm were used to measure resulting fluorescence of the mixture. Oseltamivir phosphate and zanamivir were employed as positive controls. Next, fluorescence spectroscopy was employed to measure the interactions between PPa and lipids. First, 1 \u00b5g/mL of PPa in PBS or mixed with 1 mg/mL of lipids in PBS was excited at a wavelength of 365 nm, and then the emission fluorescence was measured at wavelengths ranging from 640 to 720 nm, as indicated in Fig. 4d . The data revealed a ca. 15-fold increase in the fluorescence intensity when the assay was performed in the presence of lipids. Furthermore, an apparent red shift of 11 nm from 666 nm to 677 nm in the maximum emission wavelength was observed when lipids were added to PPa.",

Therefore, it is imperative to develop new and effective anti-IAV drugs that employ a different mechanism by targeting other viral proteins or cellular factors involved in the influenza virus life cycle.

            "text": "On the other hand, the results of experiments using different drug administration protocols, fusion inhibition assay, fluorescence spectroscopy and ITC analyses indicated that PPa is a membrane-binding compound that interacts with the viral membrane or biophysically interferes with the virus-cell membrane fusion process. Consequently, PPa may block virus entry into cells by physically damaging the viral membrane integrity, thereby inhibiting the entry of an enveloped virus in the early stage of infection, consistent with the mechanism hypothesized by Bouslama and colleagues [35] . Furthermore, similar mechanisms in which a compound physically interacts with virion envelope lipids to inhibit fusion of the influenza virus with the cell membrane have also been reported in other articles, such as the studies by Colpitts [29] , Speerstra [36] , St Vincent [37] , Kim [32] , and He [38] .",

PPa interacted with the viral lipid bilayer to alter membrane-associated functions, thereby inhibiting the entry of enveloped viruses. However, additional, more extensive experiments are still needed to further assess the antiviral efficacy, the detailed mechanism by which PPa inhibits virus entry into the host cells, and particularly, the in vivo anti-IAV effects of PPa.",

Our findings in this study expand the application of porphyrins, and significantly, by targeting an essential component in the virus life cycle and using PPa or its derivatives as a leading compound, we believe that a more potent antiviral agent may be generated. Immediately after the viral infection, the mice were orally administered PPa or oseltamivir. The compounds were administered once a day until the fifth day. The mortality rates were analyzed with Pearson's Chi-square test (P < 0.05). 5b Lung index of infected mice treated with PPa. The lung index of the mice was determined after the viral infection and PPa treatment for 3 days.

At 24 h post-infection, NP in the cytoplasm (green fluorescence) of MDCK cells was immunostained and detected under a fluorescence microscope. DAPI was used to indicate the position of the nucleus (blue fluorescence), and 5 \u03bcg/mL S-KKWK was administered using the same methods as a positive control. 2b The green fluorescence of NP expression in each group was quantified using ImageJ software, and the rate at which PPa inhibited NP expression from the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus was calculated. 2c The antiviral effects of PPa on influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) were evaluated by measuring the mRNA level of the HA gene after treatment with PPa using the \"Pretreatment of virus\" or \"During infection\" drug administration approaches. One-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) was employed to assess the statistical significance of differences in the data between the virus-infected groups: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, and *** p < 0.001. 2d.

On the other hand, the \"Pretreatment of cells\" and \"After infection\" approaches showed no activity in the tested range, clearly indicating that PPa may act on the early stage of IAV infection by blocking the entry of viruses into host cells. The inhibitory effect of PPa on virus entry was again assessed using a time of addition experiment. As shown in Fig. 3b, 5 \u03bcg/mL PPa was added to MDCK cells infected with the A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) virus (100 TCID 50 ) at the indicated time intervals, and the titers of the virus in the supernatant were then monitored at 48 h post-infection.
