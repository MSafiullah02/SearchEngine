            "text": "Bovine trichomoniasis is a veneral disease caused by the protozoal pathogen Tritrichomonas foetus and is considered to be one of the most important infectious causes of reproductive failure in beef cattle drastically reducing their breeding efficiency [1], [2], [3], [4]. The infection in bulls is primarily acquired through direct sexual contact and is asymptomatic in nature affecting neither the semen quality nor the sexual behaviour although in some cases, early death of developing foetus has also been observed [5], [6], [7]. Literature rationale has also revealed that the parasite provoked cell death to bovine oviduct epithelial cells [8] and extracellular products secreted by T. foetus were cytotoxic to bovine sperm [9]. Although the use of artificial insemination in breeding cattle has led to the virtual eradication of this organism from the cattle population in many countries, bovine trichomonad infection still is responsible for significant economic losses in the free-ranging cattle industry around the world. In light of this current problem, the identification of new chemotherapies for this pathogen is still warranted.",

An extensive investigation on the synthetic versatility of isatin has disclosed many interesting aspects of organic synthesis allowing the generation of a large number of structurally diverse analogues derived from electrophilic aromatic substitution at positions C-5 and C-7 of the phenyl ring, nucleophilic additions onto the C-3 carbonyl group, chemoselective reductions, oxidations, ring-expansions, and spiro-annulations [21]. However there are only few reports regarding the antineoplastic activities of N-alkyl and N-aryl isatins. Vine and co-workers have reported the apoptosis behaviour of N-alkyl/aryl isatins through introduction of various hydrophobic substituents like N-phenethyl, N-benzyl and N-2-naphthylmethyl on the parent nucleus that significantly increased their cytotoxicity towards lymphoma cells and against a wide range of human cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast adenocarcinoma cells and U937 human monocyte-like histolytic lymphoma cells (c), [22], (a), (b). Recent report from our lab has shown the synthesis of N-alkyl-isatin along with their cytotoxic profiles against a panel of cancer cell lines [23]. The approach has been further extended towards the synthesis of 1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered isatin conjugates with four of the synthesized scaffolds being twice as potent as 5-fluorouracil on THP-1 cell line [24].",

Eighteen of the synthesized hybrids have shown 100% growth inhibition at 100 \u03bcM with the most potent and non-cytotoxic compound showing and IC50 of 7.69 \u03bcM. The methodology was further extended towards the synthesis of \u03b2-amino alcohol based \u03b2-lactam\u2013isatin conjugates and their evaluation against T. vaginalis at 50 \u03bcM with the most active chimeric scaffold among the test series exhibited an IC50 of 9.73 \u03bcM along with low cytotoxicity [27].

As evident from Table 1, the anti-trichomonas activity of the test compounds were found to be dependent upon the nature of substituent at C-5 position as well as the presence of nature of secondary amine. The presence of a \u2013CH3 substituent at C-5 position of isatin ring of the synthesized Mannich adducts considerably improved the activity profile as evident by compounds 3a\u20133p and 5a\u20135d. Further, the introduction of 7-chloro-4-piperazin-1-yl-quinoline moiety remarkably improved the anti-trichomonas activity with a preference for halogen substituent at C-5 position of isatin ring. The most potent of the synthesized hybrids 7b and 7c showing 100% growth inhibition at 50 \u03bcM. The active compounds viz. 7a, 7b and 7c from the preliminary inhibition data were chosen in order to determine their IC50 which is the minimum concentration required for 50% growth inhibition and the results are tabulated in Table 2\n. As evident from Table 2, although the synthesized conjugates are not as active as the standard drug metronidazole, the compounds showed potent activity against the veterinary protozoal pathogen T. foetus. The compound 7c having a chloro-substituent at C-5 position of the isatin ring proved to be the most potent of the synthesized scaffolds with an IC50 of 11.3 \u03bcM. The synthesized compounds were further evaluated for their cytotoxicity against human prostate (PC-3) cancer cell lines in order to confirm if the observed activity profiles are because of their intrinsic anti-trichomonas activity or the cytotoxicity. The cytotoxic evaluation results of the test compounds at 0.2, 2.0 and 20 \u03bcM are enlisted in Table 1. As evident, virtually all the synthesized Mannich adducts are devoid of cytotoxicity except 5a and 5f, showing that the bis-adducts were cytotoxic against PC-3 cell lines compared to the mono-adducts. The most potent anti-trichomonas scaffolds viz.\n7a, 7b, 7c and 7d showed no cytotoxicity against PC-3 cell line and can be considered as a good hit.",

The synthesized scaffolds were evaluated for their activity against veterinary protozoal pathogen T. foetus. The preliminary evaluation data revealed that the introduction of 7-chloroquinoline ring markedly enhanced the activity profiles with the most active compound 7c exhibiting an IC50 of 11.3 \u03bcM. The cytotoxic studies against human prostate (PC-3) cell lines showed that the synthesized Mannich adducts are virtually devoid of any cytotoxicity and the isatin-7-chloroquinoline framework can act as an ideal starting point for the synthesis of new pharmacological templates against T. foetus.",
