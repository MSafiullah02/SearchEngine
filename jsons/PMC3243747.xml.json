LC/MS/MS analysis was performed by use of a Shimadzu LC-20 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system coupled to a QTRAP 3200 tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, Foster City, CA) operated under control of Analyst v. 1.4.2 software. The Ascentis Express C18 HPLC Column (5 cm \u00d7 2.1 mm, 2.7 \u03bcm) was maintained at 50\u00b0C. A volume of 2 \u03bcl was injected into the HPLC system and eluted with a gradient based on 10mM ammonium acetate in H2O (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B): 0\u20130.5 min, 10% solvent B; 0.5 \u20131 min, 10\u201398% solvent B; 1\u20134 min, 98% solvent B; 4\u20136 min, 10% solvent B; flow rate, 0.3 ml/min. Positive mode electrospray ionization was used for all analyses. Mass spectrometry parameters, including declustering potential and collision energy, were optimized independently for each analyte and IS. Multiple reactions monitoring the m/z transitions were used for the quantitative analysis of AMD (m/z 646.1\u2192201.1), DEA (m/z 618.1\u2192547.0), and ethopropazine (m/z 313.1\u2192114.1).

Etanercept (8 mg/kg, sc) injected 1 h before LPS inhibited the biological activity of TNF in rats and was not hepatotoxic by itself (Tukov et al., 2007; Zou et al., 2009a). The same treatment was used in this study. AMD/LPS cotreatment increased serum ALT activity, and etanercept significantly attenuated this increase (Fig. 9A). Changes in serum ALT activity were supported by histological examination of H&E-stained liver sections: the severity and frequency of necrotic foci were markedly reduced in rats cotreated with etanercept (Fig. 9B).",
