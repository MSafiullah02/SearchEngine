HRSV RNA quantification may help in affording this issue. Objectives: hRSV was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in NPAs taken upon admission to hospital and, whenever possible, at discharge and subsequent medical visits. Study design: Prospective study, including 63 infants affected by either hRSV upper or lower ARTI. Results: Based on the kinetics of viral load, hRSV etiology was identified in 25 infants in whom hRSV load dropped from 2.5 \u00d7 10 6 upon admission (presence of respiratory symptoms) to 7.5 \u00d7 10 2 RNA copies/ml NPA upon discharge (absence of symptoms) after a median time of 5 days, and in 19 infants, in whom hRSV load was determined at admission only, in association with clinical symptoms (2.4 \u00d7 10 6 copies/ml). Furthermore, low levels of hRSV RNA (<1 \u00d7 10 5 copies/ml NPA) identified 14 patients with non-hRSV ARTI. Finally, in 14 infants with hRSV coinfections or sequential infections, hRSV quantification defined the hRSV role in the current ARTI episode.
