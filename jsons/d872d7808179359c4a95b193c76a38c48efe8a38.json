This quality improvement (QI) project aimed to reduce appointment lengths and improve the patient experience. Methods: PediPlace introduced 3 interventions: improved patient tracking to measure timing on the electronic health record interface, elimination of script repetition between medical assistants and providers, and patient art kits. Results: From over 2,000 surveys indicated that patients were more satisfied; the percentage of negative survey comments decreased from 20% in 2017 and 2018 to under 10% in 2019. The overall rating of the clinic rose from 3.8 to 4.75 (on a scale of 1-5) after QI interventions as well. The number of patients not checked out declined from 49 errors in October-December 2018 to 25 errors in January-March 2019, indicating that this part of the initiative was initially successful. However, subsequent months experienced higher error rates. Analysis of over 20,000 appointments from June 2018 to July 2019 showed that appointment length did not change after interventions. Conclusions: There was no difference in appointment lengths between Hispanic/Latino patients and other patients, and an encouraging finding that suggests PediPlace providers are effective bilingual communicators. Furthermore, anecdotal evidence indicated that the art kits were positively received. The interventions appeared to improve the patient experience but did not impact appointment length. PediPlace plans to continue",

Many patients spent over 2 hours at the clinic for a 15-minute appointment. A poor patient tracking system exacerbated this challenge, making it difficult to measure appointment length or to estimate workflow delays accurately. If a patient was not checked out in the system, it appeared as if they were in the clinic for several hours. This issue resulted in inaccurate data regarding appointment lengths. Furthermore, pediatric patients were often bored due to long waits.",

Comparing 2018 with 2019 surveys, we found higher overall quantitative response ratings and fewer negative qualitative comments. However, the absolute number of comments in each quarter was quite low, so it is also possible the decrease in negative comments is due to chance. Although there was a slight wording change in the surveys from 2018 to 2019, PediPlace believes the data still indicated an improvement in patient satisfaction. These findings demonstrated that implementing QI initiatives correlated with better patient experience at PediPlace. Other factors may also have contributed to this improvement.",

It is also possible that the wait times decreased, and more time was spent face-toface with the provider. If this is the case, it is hard to discern by looking solely at total appointment length, and future projects examining each step of the appointment are necessary. With this data, PediPlace can analyze specific delays and develop targeted interventions. The new 2019 survey question regarding wait time will also provide further insights.",

However, a July 2019 survey comment stated that the provider could not speak Spanish, indicating there is still room for improvement.
