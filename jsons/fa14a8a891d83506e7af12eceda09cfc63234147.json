In order to protect consumers' health and to enhance the management of food-borne zoonotic agents from primary production to consumption, new regulations have been issued in the European Union. These Regulations notably require information concerning each step from farm to slaughterhouse. Today, pork is the most frequently consumed meat in Europe. \u2022 In this context, the purpose of this review was to collect information on risk factors on pig farms regarding the prevalence of four bacterial hazards responsible for frequent and/or serious pork-borne diseases: Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica. Among the risk factors described in the literature, feed, herd management and biosecurity measures have been shown to greatly impact the prevalence of these hazards. These risk factors may be used as information on the primary production of the pork food chain transmitted from farm to slaughterhouse. \u2022 The application of good hygiene practices in herds is paramount to reduce the risk of presence of food-borne pathogens. As a priority in biosecurity measures, limiting the mixing of pig batches is needed. These measures must be implemented to reduce the presence of pathogens in the first step in the pork food chain.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "The Hygiene Package and Regulation EC-2160/2003 require information flow from farm to slaughterhouse to enhance European consumers protection in a 'farm to fork' approach. This obligation especially concerns food-borne zoonotic hazards transmitted to humans through pork consumption, such as thermophilic Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica. Prevalence estimates of these four hazards are affected by the sampling strategy and diagnostic procedure. Individual prevalence estimates for pig carriage (from digestive contents or lymph nodes collected at slaughterhouse) were higher than individual prevalence estimates for pig shedding (from faeces). Among risk factors described in the literature, poor pen cleaning and disinfection after pig departure to slaughterhouse and poor bio-security measures are of major significance.

The management of hazards transmitted to humans by the consumption of pork is therefore of major health and economic significance. The European Commission issued in 2002 the General Food Law 1 , a regulation whose main objective is to apply risk analysis to food safety legislation, from primary production to consumption, and in 2003 Regulation EC-2160 /2003 , whose purpose is the control of food-borne pathogens in Europe. In this context, the management of hazards in the food chain necessitates the interpretation of scientific data on the characteristics and prevalence of hazards defined as 'biological, chemical or physical agents in, or condition of, food or feed with the potential to cause an adverse health effect' (Regulation EC-178/2002, article 3-14) . Biological hazards responsible for food-borne zoonoses are of particular concern since their management on farms is possible notably by reducing their digestive carriage -i.e. the presence of hazards in digestive contents -and their faecal shedding (Blaha, 1999; Collins and Wall, 2004; Maunsell and Bolton, 2004; Humphrey and J\u00f8rgensen, 2006; N\u00f8rrung and Buncic, 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 64, "end": 78, "text": "(Devine, 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 163, "end": 174, "text": "(ITP, 2003)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 487, "end": 511, "text": "consumption, and in 2003", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 512, "end": 530, "text": "Regulation EC-2160", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 531, "end": 536, "text": "/2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 904, "end": 942, "text": "(Regulation EC-178/2002, article 3-14)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1194, "end": 1207, "text": "(Blaha, 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1231, "text": "Collins and Wall, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1258, "text": "Maunsell and Bolton, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1288, "text": "Humphrey and J\u00f8rgensen, 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 1289, "end": 1314, "text": "N\u00f8rrung and Buncic, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Moreover, the Hygiene Package, which was issued in 2004 and inspired by the requirements of the General Food Law, defines the obligations of food business operators.

This could be based on the use of food chain information. Indeed, risk-based meat inspection schemes, including information flow from farm to slaughterhouse, seem to be possible in an integrated system (Blaha, 1999; Schruff and Blaha, 2004) . Since pig rearing and fattening techniques are standardized, particularly with homogenous market weight ranges and herd breeding methods, new ante mortem indicators of meat inspection could be developed from the integration of data collected on farms, as on-farm prevalence of hazards or risk factors for hazards infection in slaughter pigs. This information may be used to identify high-risk batches for which a thorough macroscopical examination of carcasses (notably to detect faecal contamination) or bacteriological analyses may be carried out.

Recent studies on the quantification of the informative value of meat inspection to detect biological hazards transmitted to humans by pork consumption have shown that high risk hazards can not be detected by a macroscopic examination of carcasses (Hamilton et al., 2002; Jelsma et al., 2006; Fosse et al., 2007) . Among these hazards, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enterica, thermophilic Campylobacter spp. and Listeria monocytogenes are characterized by the highest scores of risk for pork consumers (Fosse et al., 2008a) . Thermophilic Campylobacter are gram-negative bacteria growing only within the narrow temperature range from 30 and 47\u00b0C (Stanier et al., 1986; Doyle, 1990) . They are widely carried in poultry, pig and cattle digestive tracts, without clinical signs (Ono et al., 1995; Weijtens et al., 1999; Magras et al., 2005) . Listeria monocytogenes is a psychrotroph gram-positive bacterium with an optimal growth temperature of 30-37\u00b0C (Stanier et al., 1986; Bahk and Marth, 1990) . Numerous studies have shown the asymptomatic carriage of L. monocytogenes by pigs (Skovgaard, 1990; Buncic, 1991; Iida et al., 1998) . Salmonella enterica is a gram-negative mesophilic bacterium with a 37\u00b0C optimal growth temperature (Stanier et al., 1986; Doyle and Cliver, 1990a) . Salmonella infection is mainly subclinical in pigs, with rare septicaemia or enterocolitis reported (Barker and Van Dreumel, 1985) . Yersinia enterocolitica is a psychrotrophic gram-negative bacteria which can grow at the risk of transmission of Salm. enterica. The forenamed elements should be taken into account to characterize farms in a risk assessment approach and to improve zoonotic hazard management in the pork food chain. temperatures as low as 0\u00b0C and as high as 44\u00b0C (Stanier et al., 1986; Doyle and Cliver, 1990b) . Pathogenic strains of Y. enterocolitica belong to biotypes 1B, 2, 3, 4 and mainly serotypes O:3, O:5, O:8, O:9. They are asymptomatically carried in pigs in the digestive tract and in tonsils (Tauxe et al., 1987; Simonet and Catteau, 2005) .
