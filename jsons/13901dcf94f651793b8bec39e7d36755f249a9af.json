Here we use county-level observations of reported infections and deaths 11 , in conjunction with human mobility data 12 and a metapopulation transmission model 13,14 , to quantify changes of disease transmission rates in US counties from March 15, 2020 to May 3, 2020. We find significant reductions of the basic reproductive numbers in major metropolitan areas in association with social distancing and other control measures. Counterfactual simulations indicate that, had these same control measures been implemented just 1-2 weeks earlier, a substantial number of cases and deaths could have been averted. Specifically, nationwide, 61.6% [95% CI: 54.6%-67.7%] of reported infections and 55.0% [95% CI: 46.1%-62.2%] of reported deaths as of May 3, 2020 could have been avoided if the same control measures had been implemented just one week earlier. We also examine the effects of delays in re-implementing social distancing following a relaxation of control measures. A longer response time results in a stronger rebound of infections and death. Our findings underscore the importance of early intervention and aggressive response in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.",

During the initial growth of a pandemic, infections increase exponentially. As a consequence, early intervention and fast response are critical for limiting morbidity and mortality. To quantify the effects of earlier interventions on COVID-19 outcomes in the US, we performed two counterfactual simulations in which the sequence of transmission rates and ascertainment rate inferred for March 15 -May 3, 2020, were shifted back 1 and 2 weeks, i.e. to March 8, 2020 and March 1, 2020, respectively. Specifically, we integrate the transmission model from February 21 to March 8 or March 1, and then apply the daily posterior parameters, i.e., % and !s, as estimated beginning March 15. The simulations were generated until May 3, 2020. For the last 1-2 weeks without inferred parameters due to the shift in time window, we applied the final parameter estimates of May 3, 2020, the last day of inference. Fig. 2g-h) . These dramatic reductions of morbidity and mortality due to more timely deployment of control measures highlights the critical need for aggressive, early response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Consequently, we adopted a Gamma distribution to model = ' , but tested longer mean periods (>@), as symptom onset often lags the onset of contagiousness, using US data prior to March 13, 2020 22 . Our analysis indicates that an average delay of 9 days supports better fit to the daily incidence data. As a result, we adopted = ' = 9 days (> = 1.85, @ = 4.86) in this study. Based on the daily incidence and death data in the US, the national death curve has a 7-day lag compared with the incidence curve (Fig. S7) . As a result, we used a gamma distribution with a mean of 16 days (> = 1.85, @ = 8.65) to represent the delay between a person transitioning from latent to contagious and death.",

For instance, if the number of inter-county visitors was reduced by 30% in a county on a given day relative to baseline estimates on March 1, 2020, the size of subpopulations traveling to this county would be reduced by 30% accordingly. This real-time mobility data are available between March 1, 2020 and May 2, 2020. For dates beyond May 2, 2020, we maintained the last known level of inter-county movement.

The prior for the ascertainment rate was drawn from a distribution with a median value % = 0.080 (95% CI: 0.069-0.093), estimated in a previous study 22 . The prior transmission rates were scaled based on local population density using the following relation: ! ! = \".)\u00d7+,-!\" (/0 # ) 2#'!34(+,-!\" (/0)) \u00d7 !.

For ! shared by multiple counties, population density H( ! is averaged over those counties. To account for reporting delays of confirmed cases and deaths, at each daily model update, we integrated the model forward for 16 days using the prior model state, and used incidence number 9 days ahead and death number 16 days ahead to constrain current model variables and parameters. Given the large number of parameters in the model, the inference system may not be fully identifiable. To alleviate this issue, we imposed a \u00b130% limit on the daily change of parameters % and ! ! . This smoothing constraint is reasonable considering the continuity of human's behavioral change.
