This RNA is similar to cellular mRNAs, as it contains 5\u2032-capped and 3\u2032 polyadenylated ends. The first two thirds of the genome contain two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs) ORF1a and ORF1b (Fig. 1\n). Translation of ORF1a yields polyprotein 1a (pp1a), and \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting allows translation of ORF1b to yield polyprotein pp1ab (Ziebuhr, 2005). These polyproteins are co- and post-translationally processed into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps), most of them driving viral genome replication and subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) synthesis. PDCoV replicase pp1ab is processed in 15 nsps, as Deltacoronavirus genomes lack nsp1 gene (Woo et al., 2012). The 3\u2032 third of the porcine CoV genome encodes the structural proteins in the order 5\u2032-S-E-M-N-3\u2032. In addition, it includes up to three genus-specific genes different among CoV members (Fig. 1).",

This could produce a severe diarrhea as a consequence of malabsorption. Often, diarrhea is accompanied by vomiting, which increases severe dehydration, anorexia and appetite loss. These clinical symptoms could lead to animal death. In general, PEDV and TGEV are considered more virulent than PDCoV (Chen et al., 2015), although after experimental inoculation of gnotobiotic piglets, PDCoV caused a severe disease (Jung et al., 2015b). Further analyses will be needed to determine whether the difference in viral strain, animal age, or other factors influence PDCoV pathogenesis.",

Symptoms are very severe in nursing piglets, under 2-weeks of age, with a mortality of up to 95%. In weaned to finisher pigs and pregnant sows the clinical signs are milder and self-limiting within 5\u201310 days after the onset of disease (Jung and Saif, 2015). The higher susceptibility of younger piglets has been associated with the slower turnover of enterocytes (up to one week) in neonatal piglets compared with older animals (2\u20133 days). Enterocytes turnover correlated with the presence of LGR5+ stem cells in the intestinal crypt, which is reduced in nursing piglets (Jung et al., 2015a). In addition, a correlation between the severity of the infection and the innate immune responses has been observed. In young piglets natural killer (NK) cell activity and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 production were lower than those in weaned pigs (Annamalai et al., 2015).",

The emergence of virulent PEDV strains in China during 2010, even in previously vaccinated farms, and in 2013 in the USA points to the necessity for more effective vaccines. Subunit or killed vaccines are only partially effective inducing mucosal immunity, although they could be suitable for boosting immunity in sows prior to farrowing (Oh et al., 2014, Paudel et al., 2014). Live vaccines are more effective inducing long-lasting immunity, although current live attenuated vaccines did not prevent virus shedding. This could represent a biosafety problem as the vaccine strain can revert to virulence by recombination with circulating strains. In fact, such recombinant PEDV isolates have been identified in Asia (Li et al., 2016).",

            "text": "The engineering of well-defined recombinant enteric porcine CoVs may represent a major progress towards the development of more effective and biosafe vaccines. To this end, a combination of reverse genetics systems, using infectious cDNA clones, and analysis of virus-host interactions is required. First, viral genes modulating the innate immune response should be identified, as their deletion frequently leads to attenuated viruses and, therefore to potential vaccine candidates. The first CoV infectious cDNA clone was obtained for TGEV, as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) (Almazan et al., 2000). Since then, additional cDNA clones were obtained for TGEV and PEDV, based either on BACs or in vitro ligation (Almazan et al., 2014, Beall et al., 2016, Jengarn et al., 2015). This review will focus on the study of enteric CoVs interaction with the host to determine virulence genes, since the modification or deletion of these genes may lead to virus attenuation, and to the generation of vaccine candidates to prevent infection by porcine CoVs. Alternatively, analysis of virus-host interactions may teach us the signaling pathways required by the virus for its replication or to cause pathogenesis. Once this has been accomplished, the selection of inhibitors of these signaling pathways could result in the identification of antivirals.",

In contrast, apoptosis produced by PDCoV has only been detected in cell cultures but not in vivo (Jung et al., 2016). The mechanism of apoptosis induction, and its effect on infection is different for TGEV and PEDV. TGEV-induced cell death is caspase-dependent, and apoptosis inhibition has no effect on viral replication (Eleouet et al., 1998). In contrast, PEDV induces a caspase-independent cyclophilin D-dependent pathway, and apoptosis inhibition decreases viral replication (Kim and Lee, 2014). Independently of the mechanism involved, in the infection by both CoVs, apoptosis has been associated with the promotion of virus shedding and pathogenesis (Cruz et al., 2011, Kim and Lee, 2014). It is worth noting that apoptosis is also related with innate immune response. For TGEV it has been demonstrated that apoptosis induction correlates with IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines production (Becares et al., 2016, Cruz et al., 2011). Therefore, apoptosis may contribute to enteric CoV pathogenesis not only by killing infected cells, but also by facilitating viral dissemination and inflammation in the infected tissues.",

UPR activates three main signaling pathways to avoid the accumulation of proteins with folding alterations in the ER. Sometimes ER stress is irreversible, and cells undergo apoptosis. ER stress is also interconnected with the innate immune response and other host-cell responses (Hetz, 2012). The infection with many CoVs induces ER stress, and a role of UPR in pathogenesis has been described (DeDiego et al., 2011). In the case of enteric porcine CoVs, the induction of the UPR response has been reported for PEDV, with a negative effect on viral replication (Wang et al., 2014b). In contrast, TGEV infection does not induce ER stress (Cruz et al., 2011), despite the increased expression of several UPR mediators such as ATF4 or GADD34 after infection [(Cruz et al., 2011), S. Zu\u00f1iga and L. Enjuanes, unpublished results]. ER stress may then be an additional factor contributing to PEDV pathogenesis.",

In addition, it has been recently demonstrated that p38 kinase activation has a role in human severe and acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV pathogenesis, and that p38 kinase inhibition promotes survival of infected animals (Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2014).

Transcription factor p53 is a key hub connecting many host signaling pathways responding to different stimuli. In this sense, there is a crosstalk between p53, which is also stimulated by IFN, and the antiviral response (Sato and Tsurumi, 2013, Takaoka et al., 2003).

Despite the low conservation in sequence, the overall nsp1 structure is highly conserved in the two CoV genera (Jansson, 2013), and mutations in nsp1 could lead to attenuated viruses (Jauregui et al., 2013, Jimenez-Guarde\u00f1o et al., 2015). Overexpression studies indicated that TGEV nsp1 protein suppresses protein translation, similarly to other CoV nsp1 proteins (Huang et al., 2011). Reduction of host protein translation has been suggested as a mechanism for IFN antagonism, although mutational analyses have indicated that these two nsp1 functions may be separated (Jauregui et al., 2013). Overexpression of PEDV nsp1 protein also led to inhibition of the innate immune response (Zhang et al., 2016). The nsp1 protein induced proteasomal-dependent CREB-binding protein (CBP) degradation, and suppression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression. Interestingly, CBP degradation also occurs during PEDV infection (Zhang et al., 2016). Therefore, mutations affecting Alphacoronavirus nsp1 could lead to attenuated viruses to be used as vaccine candidates.",

Therefore, this protein has essential functions in viral RNA synthesis, as a component of the unique CoV proofreading system, and the viral mRNA capping machinery. A role of nsp14 in the modulation of the innate immune response was recently hypothesized (Kindler and Thiel, 2014). Indeed, PEDV nsp14 overexpression antagonizes IFN production (Zhang et al., 2016). The first demonstration of nsp14 role in the modulation of the innate immune response in the viral context comes from recent findings with TGEV (Becares et al., 2016). A TGEV virus mutant in the first zinc-finger motif included in the ExoN domain of nsp14 protein was generated (TGEV-ZF-C). This mutant virus caused a decreased accumulation of dsRNA in the infected cells and, as a consequence, a reduced IFN, pro-inflammatory cytokines and ISGs production (Becares et al., 2016). It remains to be determined whether this mutant virus will be attenuated in vivo and could be used as a vaccine candidate.",

Therefore N protein modification, required for the study of N protein functions in the infection context, represents a challenge. Nevertheless, there is accumulating evidence indicating that N protein could be a virulence factor. PEDV N protein expression has been correlated with the activation of NF-\u03baB and increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Xu et al., 2013b) possibly by the activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathways (Cao et al., 2015b). On the other hand, PEDV N protein overexpression prevents TBK1-IRF3 interaction, avoiding IRF3 activation and IFN production (Ding et al., 2014b). Finally, the alteration of porcine RNAi response has been related with pathogenesis (Liu et al., 2015). In this sense, both TGEV and PEDV N proteins have RNA silencing suppressor activity, which may modulate host cell RNAi response (Cui et al., 2015). Interestingly, RNA silencing suppressor activity of TGEV N protein was stronger than that of PEDV N protein (Cui et al., 2015), although the implications of this observation in virulence require further analyses.",

Interestingly, a novel SeCoV has been recently discovered from diarrheic samples, which is a recombinant virus with a TGEV genomic background and S gene from PEDV (Boniotti et al., 2016). This SeCoV does not encode protein 3a, as it contains extensive deletions in the coding sequence and in transcription regulating sequence (TRS) including conserved core sequence (CS) essential for sgmRNA expression (Sola et al., 2015). Similarly, most PRCV isolates contain genome deletions in ORF 3a region, resulting either in a truncated 3a protein or in the complete absence of protein 3a expression. These data suggest that ORF3 encoded proteins may play a role in vivo.",

Mutations in TGEV S protein have been associated with the virus respiratory or enteric tropism. Thus, changes in the coding sequence, including small deletions and insertions (1 or 2 aa), into the first 390 aa of TGEV S protein correlate with changes in tropism [(Ballesteros et al., 1997), C.M. Sanchez and L. Enjuanes, unpublished results]. The emergence of the PRCV with a large S protein deletion in the N-terminus, ranging from aa 23 to aa 249 depending on the PRCV strain, led to the maintenance of the respiratory tropism and the loss of enteric tropism (Callebaut et al., 1988, Pensaert et al., 1986). This virus became prevalent in the porcine population worldwide, which may have elicited a protective immune response against TGEV (Bernard et al., 1989, Saif and Sestak, 2006). In fact, pigs seropositive for PRCV could be infected with TGEV, although they develop mild enteritis and usually recover form the infection.",

Several of these mutations were shared between the two attenuated viruses, passed 100 times in cell culture, and most of these changes clustered in the N-terminal domain of S protein (Fig. 4) (S. Zu\u00f1iga, A. Pascual-Iglesias, L. Enjuanes, unpublished results).",

In addition, two PEDV strains with a large deletion (up to 197 aa) in the N-terminus of S protein have also been isolated, one in the USA (PC177) and the other one in Japan (TTR-2) (Masuda et al., 2015, Oka et al., 2014). This deletion was similar, in location and size, to that found in PRCV that appeared in the field. The data indicate that PC177 virus deletion was acquired during cell culture passage (Oka et al., 2014) and preliminary data indicate that PC177 strain retains the ability to grow in vivo (Lin et al., 2015b). In contrast, TTR-2 virus deletion appeared in the field (Masuda et al., 2015). The virulence of TTR-2 strain in colostrum-deprived piglets has been recently analyzed. The results indicate that this PEDV strain is attenuated, as all piglets developed clinical signs although all of them eventually recovered from the infection (Suzuki et al., 2016).",

Similar results were observed after an experimental inoculation of 4-day-old conventional suckling piglets with an S-INDEL strain that led to a delay in diarrhea appearance, shorter symptom duration, and a reduction in the number of deaths compared with a virulent PEDV strain (Lin et al., 2015a). This data have been reinforced by a recently published study showing a reduced pathogenicity of S-INDEL strains in 5-day-old piglets (Chen et al., 2016). Interestingly, inoculation with S-INDEL strains confers cross-protection against a challenge with virulent PEDV strains, indicating the potential of S-INDEL mild strains as bases for the development of novel PEDV vaccines (Goede et al., 2015, Lin et al., 2015a).",

To this end, a deeper knowledge of the porcine CoVs-host interactions is needed, to identify which host cell pathways are affected during porcine enteric CoV infection that influence the modulation of porcine CoV pathogenesis. The analysis of the viral genes involved in porcine CoV virulence will be valuable for the rational design of attenuated viruses that may serve as effective vaccine candidates.",
