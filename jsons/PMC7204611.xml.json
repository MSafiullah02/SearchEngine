In addition, gonadal steroids can differentially affect the HPA axis resulting in sex differences in responses to stress [14]. Animal models and human studies support an increased risk in males for behavioral or neurodevelopmental disorders in response to prenatal and early life stress, whereas females appear to have an increased risk in adolescence and throughout adulthood, especially if they have experienced stress-related early life adversity or trauma. During the perimenopause and menopausal transition, women are at greater risk for presenting with affective disorders including depression as well as schizophrenia [15].",

ACE2 can also cleave angiotensin I to angiotensin 1\u20139, which can then be further converted to angiotensin 1\u20137 by ACE. ACE2, angiotensin 1\u20137 and its MAS receptor constitute the vasoprotective arm of the RAAS. Excessive activation of the classical RAAS leads to arterial hypertension, accompanied by immuno-metabolic disorders and obligatory culminates in end-organ damage in the absence of adequate therapy (for recent reviews see [19\u201323]). The RAAS and in particular ACE2 appear to be attractive targets to fight COVID-19. Therein, the role of ACE inhibitors and AT1R blockers is currently highly controversial. On the one hand, these drugs could increase ACE2 expression and potentiate SARS-CoV-2 cell entry [24]. On the other hand, increased ACE2 production would result in a higher circulating level of soluble ACE2, which neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 [25]. Yet, the precise role of the available RAAS-targeting drugs in COVID-19 disease waits to be unraveled.",

The same effect was observed when ACE2 overexpression was targeted to the CRH-synthesizing cells of the hypothalamus suggesting that especially the HPA axis is affected [27]. In mice transgenic for ACE2, the olfactory bulb of the brain is a major target organ for SARS infection leading to transneural spread [28\u201330].",

Intriguingly, in these patients, following the lung, the adrenal belonged to the organs with the highest concentration of virus particles. In addition, the pituitary was affected [33] making it clear that the HPA axis is targeted during a coronavirus infection. Furthermore, the gastrointestinal tract is targeted [33] suggesting associations with appearance of gastrointestinal infection symptoms in some patients [34].

In turn, glucocorticoids exert negative feedback influences on immune cells to suppress further synthesis and release of cytokines, thereby protecting the host from the detrimental consequences of an overactive immune response (e.g., tissue damage, autoimmunity, or septic shock) [44, 45]. A number of cytokines have been measured in serum of COVID-19 patients [46]. Initial plasma IL-1B, IL-1RA, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, bFGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFN-\u03b3, IP-10, MCP1, MIP-1A, MIP-1B, PDGF, TNF-\u03b1, and VEGF concentrations were higher in patients than in healthy adults, whereas plasma levels of IL-5, IL-12p70, IL-15, Eotaxin, and RANTES were similar in patients and controls. IFN-\u03b1 and \u03b2 were not measured. These results suggest that an overproduction of cytokines might be responsible for the damage of the lungs in COVID-19 patients. However, also host factors such as expression of ACE2 and underlying diseases such as hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders might influence susceptibility to infection and progression of the disease [34, 47].",

This might be due to different reasons such as storage of coronaviral dsRNA in double-membrane vesicles and activation of numerous mechanisms dedicated to suppress dsRNA-dependent IFN induction [48]. This explains how these viruses employ mechanisms to escape, dampen, or block the antiviral interferon response in human cells. Furthermore, the ability of certain pathogens to escape from host immune response has been reported to be accomplished by host protein mimicry [49]. Thereby, no or a limited amount of antibodies are created, which also explains why certain vaccines may be ineffective. On the other hand, the similarity between pathogenic antigens and host proteins may lead to immune cross reactivity, whereby the reaction of the immune system toward the pathogenic antigens may harm similar human proteins, eventually causing autoimmune disease [50].",

When the host produces antibodies against these viral antigens, the antibodies also bind to ACTH thereby limiting HPA activity and secretion of corticosteroids, which could lead to adrenal insufficiency [51]. This suggests that corticosteroids may be used to treat COVID-19 patients thereby helping the immune system to fight the infection. Indeed, corticosteroid supplements have improved the clinical conditions of many SARS patients [52]. On the other hand, a number of studies reported corticosteroid-treatment of SARS patients to be rather harmful (reviewed in [53]). For example, early steroid treatment has been associated with delayed viral clearance [54], and it has been found that patients with psychosis received higher cumulative doses of steroids than patients without psychosis [55]. In a study with 138 COVID-19 patients, where 45% received methylprednisolone, no effective outcome was observed after the treatment [56]. Thereby, the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 is not recommended [34].",

In addition, to the actual infection and treatment, psychological stress is likely to occur due to pandemic restrictions. Isolation during a pandemic is somewhat similar to physical immobilization stress, which leads to increased expression of enzymes involved in steroidogenesis [57] and elevated plasma corticosteroids [58]. Chronic restraint stress in rats also alters the RAAS by reduction of plasma aldosterone levels despite significant increases in plasma renin activity. Public anxiety of being infected is high; health care workers, who have higher vulnerability of acquiring and spreading the virus, are in particular those most likely to be distressed. In a study about the impact of MERS in health care workers in Saudi Arabia, a significant proportion expressed anxiety about the risk of acquiring MERS-CoV infection and for transmitting it to family members [59, 60].",

Social isolation and loneliness are common sources of chronic stress in adults. They are correlated to a higher risk of mortality and cardiovascular disease, which have been associated with activation of the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system. Repeated and chronic social stress leads to glucocorticoid release, enhanced myelopoiesis, upregulated proinflammatory gene expression, and oxidative stress [63]. Furthermore, psychological stress due to social isolation is known to cause abnormal feeding behaviors. In addition to psychological reactions, such as depression and anxiety, stress triggers various physiological reactions including an increase in respiration and blood pressure. An activated stress axis also influences the body\u2019s metabolism [64, 65]. In particular, changes in feeding behavior are a well-known phenotype related to stress [66].",

The infected cells support active virus replication, which leads to their own destruction [73]. Another study by Mallick et al. has further revealed that a subset of these stem cells, the bronchoalveolar stem cells, are the prime target of the SARS-CoV infection of stem cells [74]. These observations suggest that, in addition to pneumocytes, lung stem cells/progenitors are involved in coronavirus infection. This might also explain the long course of illness, in the context of continued deterioration of lung tissues and apparent loss of capacity of lung repair observed in COVID-19 patients.",

It would be reasonable to hypothesize that in a manner analogous to what happens in the lung, stem cells of the HPA axis could be affected by SARS-CoV-2. We and others have shown that stem cells play an important role in stress [75, 76]. Our work on the adrenal suggests that stem cell populations in both the adrenal cortex and medulla are highly susceptible to stress [77, 78]. Under normal conditions, they seem to be quiescent or only slowly contribute to organ homeostasis. However, in stressful situations they enter the cell cycle leading to differentiation into mature lineages. Furthermore, we have shown that differentiation of adrenocortical stem cells is faster in females than in males [79].",

Many of these affect the endocrine stress axis, which again might lead to long-term consequences. From earlier coronavirus outbreaks, it is evident that survivors and health care workers are at increased risk of developing mental illness years after the outbreak. Such long-lasting impacts might be due to morphological changes in the brain and in the organs of the HPA axis. They could also be influenced by permanent epigenetic changes in stem cells as induced by the actual infection or the different forms of severe stress. Furthermore, sex differences in response to stress should be considered. All together these mechanisms could contribute to the increased risk of developing mental disorders after a pandemic such as COVID-19. Because of this enhanced long-term susceptibility to mental illness, it is imperative to monitor affected populations for an extended time during the course of, as well as after, the current and devastating COVID-19 pandemic.",
