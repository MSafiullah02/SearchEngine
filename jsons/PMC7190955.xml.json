            "text": "In mid-December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia associated with the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China, and rapidly spread to other areas globally[1]. The World Health Organization declared the pneumonia outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern[2]. The confirmed patients are the main source of infection; however, patients in the latent period and asymptomatic patients can be potential sources of infection[1]. People are generally vulnerable, including children[1,3-6]. Most patients have symptoms of fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue while a small number of patients have symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain[1,6-8]. A minority of patients seek medical care with gastrointestinal symptoms as the first manifestation[5]. The detection of COVID-19 nucleic acid from fecal specimens suggests the possibility of transmission via the gastrointestinal tract[1,5,9], although this possibility remains to be further clarified. Digestive endoscopy is an invasive procedure during which children cannot wear masks; therefore, they have higher risks of exposure to COVID-19, and the digestive endoscopy center is a relatively high-risk area for COVID-19 infection. Based on the above factors and in combination with related policies, regulations and norms[1,10], a prevention and control program for the COVID-19 pneumonia in a children\u2019s digestive endoscopy center was established to prevent the COVID-19 nosocomial infection and provide guidelines for endoscopists[11-17]. After being approved by the director of Shenzhen Children's Hospital, this program was initiated from February 1, 2020. It was also put into practice in Shenzhen Baoan Maternal and Child Health Hospital as suggested by the Pediatric Committee of Shenzhen Medical Association. The case detection rate and the nosocomial infection rate were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the program.",

            "text": "During the COVID-19 epidemic, it is recommended that ordinary gastroscopy, colonoscopy, and enteroscopy should be suspended; only endoscopy for emergency diagnosis and treatment is kept in normal operation and is required to proceed as follows: (1) The clinical physician should determine whether the child needs emergency endoscopic diagnosis or treatment. If it is not urgent or the child\u2019s condition is stable, it is recommended to make an appointment after the epidemic. When emergency endoscopy is necessary, the physician should rigorously evaluate the child's condition according to the indications for emergency endoscopy and informed the parents of the possible risks. (2) Indications for selective, confined and emergency endoscopy are defined as follows: (A) Indications for selective endoscopy: common gastrointestinal symptoms such as recurrent abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal distension and diarrhea; a small amount of hematemesis and hematochezia. The illness is less severe, and the patient's condition is good; (B) Indications for confined endoscopy: foreign body in digestive tract (blunt, noncorrosive, nonobstructive); mild gastrointestinal tract bleeding; acute abdominal pain (suspected Henoch-Schonlein purpura); upper gastrointestinal obstruction; endoscopic feeding tube placement; dilatation of esophageal stenosis; chronic diarrhea (suspected inflammatory bowel disease); chronic pain that is unrelieved after routine treatment; frequent vomiting with unknown causes; (C) Indications for emergency endoscopy: Button buttery, magnets, sharp or toxic foreign bodies in the digestive tract; gastrointestinal tract obstruction caused by foreign bodies; endoscopic diagnosis and treatment for massive gastrointestinal bleeding; and (D) For special cases, endoscopists\u2019 consultation is needed to determine whether digestive endoscopy is necessary. (3) The epidemiological history of the children and their family members is screened: (A) A history of travel or residence in Wuhan or surrounding cities, or in other communities where confirmed cases were reported within 14 d; (B) A history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms who are from Wuhan or surrounding cities, or from other communities where confirmed cases were reported within 14 d; (C) Cluster onset of disease; and (D) A history of contact with diagnosed patients with COVID-19 infection, which refers to positive detection of COVID-19 nucleic acid. In the case of any of the above epidemiological history and any two of the following clinical manifestations, the screening procedure should be carried out as suspected casesbased on fever, imaging findings of pneumonia, and normal or reduced white blood cell count or reduced lymphocyte count[1]. (4) Emergency endoscopy will be arranged if the patient has a history of the above epidemiology but no fever, no imaging manifestation, or no leukocyte decline or lymphocyte decline. (5) On the day of examination, the staff should take the temperature of all children and their family members who enter the digestive endoscopy center. If the children's temperature exceeds 37.3 \u00b0C, they should be immediately sent to the fever clinic for further assessment; if their family member\u2019s temperature exceeds 37.3 \u00b0C, they should be referred to a designated fever clinic for consultation. If the child's temperature is normal, endoscopy will be arranged directly. (6) Children and their family members are required to wear masks before they arrive at the endoscopy center. After confirming that the children and their family members have no fever, epidemiological exposure or any symptoms, the staff of the front desk should ask the parents to sign the informed consent form. (7) The endoscopists should carefully review the documents, including informed consent, chest computed tomographic findings and routine blood results, before beginning endoscopy. (8) Anesthesiologists should strictly implement disposable oxygen delivery catheters and oxygen masks and closely monitor vital signs during anesthesia to avoid choking. Quarantine measures should be taken to avoid cross-infection in the anesthesia recovery room. And (9) The transport and disinfection protection of children should be supervised by professional nurses.",
