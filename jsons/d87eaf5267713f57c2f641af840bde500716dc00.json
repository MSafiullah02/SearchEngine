To ensure a steady and cost-effective supply of the animals, a Tg mouse model with homozygous expression of hDPP4, designated hDPP4 +/+ Tg mice, was developed through mating of hDPP4 +/\u2212 mice and used as breeders for generating offspring of both genotypes of hDPP4 Tg mice. Because hDPP4 is the functional MERS-CoV receptor, the doubling of encoded hDPP4 gene in hDPP4 +/+ Tg mice could render them more susceptible than their hDPP4 +/\u2212 counterparts to MERS-CoV infection and disease. To our surprise, we found that hDPP4 +/+ mice are more resistant than their hDPP4 +/\u2212 counterparts to MERS-CoV infection. We subsequently found that an increased expression of functionally intact soluble hDPP4 (shDPP4) in the circulation of hDPP4 +/+ Tg mice, relative to that of hDPP4 +/\u2212 mice, was associated with this increased resistance and might be, at least in part, accountable for the seemingly counterintuitive findings on susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection. This notion was supported by studies showing that elevated shDPP4 levels, brought about by administration of recombinant shDPP4 (rshDPP4), resulted in increased resistance of recipient hDPP4 +/\u2212 mice to MERS-CoV. Together, our results indicate that manipulation of shDPP4 might serve as a strategy for counteracting MERS-CoV infection and disease in humans.",

Testing binding specificity of the rshDPP4 to the RBD proteins of MERS-CoV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; both RBDs were generous gifts of Drs Du and Jiang at New York Blood Center, NY) was determined in ELISA-based assays [7, 9] . For determining the capacity of rshDPP4 to inhibit MERS-CoV infection in vitro we initially used our standard microneutralization procedure with cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition as the endpoint. These assays revealed a dose-dependent reduction of CPE at 72 hours, ranging from less than 5% for 100, 50, and 25 \u03bcg/mL and gradually increased to approximately 30% for 12.5 \u03bcg/mL of rshDPP4. In addition to standard microneutralization assay with a CPE endpoint, we measured the antiviral effect of rshDPP4 using virus yield of each rshDPP4 dilution from 100 to 0.8 \u03bcg/mL, expressed as log 10 TCID 50 /mL.",

To our surprise, we found that hDPP4 +/+ mice were more resistant than hDPP4 +/\u2212 mice as indicated by LD 50 values of 4.3 and 32.4 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV for hDPP4 +/\u2212 and hDPP4 +/+ mice, respectively. To confirm this seemingly counterintuitive finding and rule out any potential effect of age and gender, we repeated the study using age-(6-8 weeks old) and sex-matched Tg mice of both genotypes. Shown in Figure 1A is a representative of 2 independently performed experiments that confirmed the LD50 difference; values for the hDPP4 +/\u2212 and hDPP4 +/+ mice were 7.7 and 70.0 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV, respectively, indicating that hDPP4 +/+ mice are more resistant than their age-and sex-matched hDPP4 +/\u2212 counterparts to MERS-CoV infection.",

Three mice of each strain, unless indicated otherwise, were euthanized at 3, 5, and 7 dpi to assess infectious viral titers and the histopathology of lungs and brains. In contrast to DPP4 +/\u2212 mice, which exhibited marked weight loss, starting at 3-4 dpi, and 2 deaths at 6 dpi (data not shown), infected hDPP4 +/+ mice exhibited minimal weight changes and uniformly survived through 7 dpi when the experiment was terminated ( Figure 1B) . When the viral loads were measured at 3 dpi, we readily recovered infectious virus from the lungs, but not the brains, of all 3 hDPP4 +/\u2212 mice examined, but from the lung of only 1 of 3 hDPP4 +/+ mice. Although we usually recover virus from lungs of some mice, efforts to recover infectious virus from both lung and brain specimens of both strains of Tg mice at 5 dpi were unsuccessful (data not shown); however, we were able to retrieve infectious virus from the brain (but not lungs) of the sole hDPP4 +/\u2212 survivor and from all 3 hDPP4 +/+ mice that survived to 7 dpi. The virus titer in the brain was 10 6.2 /g for the single hDPP4 +/\u2212 mouse, a titer significantly higher than the average of 10 3.7 /g for 3 hDPP4 +/+ mice ( Figure 1C ). This ability to recover infectious virus from the lungs approximately 2-3 days earlier than from the brains is consistent with the pattern, kinetics, and tissue distribution of MERS-CoV infection in DPP4 Tg mice we have previously reported [6] . We also compared the histopathology of lungs and brains, 2 of the prime targets of MERS-CoV infection of hDPP4 Tg mice [5] . Although infected DPP4 +/\u2212 mice elicited mild-to-moderate histopathological changes within the lungs at 3 dpi after a dose of 10 3 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV infection, as in our earlier study [6] , infected DPP4 +/+ mice exhibited reduced or no lung histopathology (data not shown). Brain histopathology at 7 dpi for the sole hDPP4 +/\u2212 survivor had infiltrations of mononuclear cells in the meninges ( Figure 1D , below), perivascular cuffing ( Figure 1D , above and below), microglial nodules ( Figure 1D , below), microhemorrhage ( Figure 1D , above) and cell death at the junctions of gray and white matter ( Figure 1D , above) but not in DPP4 +/+ mice. Collectively, the significant differences between these 2 strains of mice in their LD 50 values, seroconversion rates, viral loads, weight loss, and histopathology support the notion that DPP4 +/+ mice are more resistant than DPP4 +/\u2212 mice to MERS-CoV infection. . Sera of naive human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4 +/+ ) mice contain significantly higher levels of soluble hDPP4 (shDPP4) that exhibit higher levels of neutralizing antibody-like activity than those of naive hDPP4 +/\u2212 mice. A, Groups of at least 10 age-and sex-matched hDPP4 +/+ , hDPP4 +/\u2212 , and their transgene-negative (hDPP4 \u2212/\u2212 ) littermates were subjected to retroorbital bleeding to assess the contents of shDPP4, using commercially available ELISA kits that quantify specific hDPP4 (hDPP4 +/+ vs hDPP4 +/\u2212 , P < .001 t test). B, Sera obtained from naive hDPP4 +/+ and hDPP4 +/\u2212 mice (n = 10 of each) and hDPP4 \u2212/\u2212 mice (n = 6) were subjected to the standard Vero E6-based microneutralization tests to determine their potential to neutralize MERS-CoV. Data are presented as the geometric mean neutralization titers (GMT log 2 ) of 50% neutralization titer (NT 50 ). A 1-10 dilution of sera is approximately 3.4 log 2 . (* P = .026, t test and Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test, when compared to those of hDPP4 +/\u2212 mice). The GMT titers of hDPP4 \u2212/\u2212 mice were uniformly below the limit of detection. Abbreviations: ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus. Dotted line, limit of detection. Tg mice could be different, thereby contributing to their difference in susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection. Using a commercial ELISA-based analysis, we were unable to detect shDPP4 in age-and sex-matched hDPP4-negative (hDPP4 \u2212/\u2212 ) littermates. However, as shown in Figure 2A , a representative of 2 independently performed studies, an average of 8.1 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcg/mL (mean \u00b1 SD) and 6.2 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcg/mL of shDPP4 was detected in hDPP4 +/+ (n = 16) and DPP4 +/\u2212 mice (n = 10), respectively. As shDPP4 retains its binding specificity to MERS-CoV RBD protein [7] , the significantly different expression of shDPP4 in the sera of these 2 strains of Tg mice (P < .001) prompted us to examine if elevated shDPP4 expression might relate to the higher resistance of DPP4 +/+ to MERS-CoV infection by possibly acting like a decoy that binds MERS-CoV RBD and prevents virus infection. Using microneutralization tests, we noted that the 50% neutralization titers (NT 50 ), expressed as the geometric mean titers (GMT), were 3.9 \u00b1 0.3 and 3.1 \u00b1 0.1 for hDPP4 +/+ and hDPP4 +/\u2212 mice, respectively (P = .026), compared to those of hDPP4 \u2212/\u2212 mice which were uniformly below the limit of detection (i.e., ~3.0) ( Figure 2B ).",

Using our limited amount of insect cell-derived rshDPP4, known to specifically bind to RBD of MERS-CoV but not SARS-CoV, and to neutralize MERS-CoV in vitro in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3A and 3B), we administered 100 \u03bcg of rshDPP4, via the intraperitoneal route, into each of 3 DPP4 +/\u2212 mice 2 hours before (\u22122 hours) and 24 hours after (+ 24 hours) infection with 10 3 TCID 50 of MERS-CoV. The effect of the rshDPP4 against MERS-CoV infection was assessed at 3 dpi by using the titers of infectious virus within the lungs as the end point for this pilot study. While all of 3 PBS-treated mice exhibited moderate titers of live virus, we were unable to recover infectious virus from any of 3 rshDPP4-treated mice ( Table 1 , Experiment 1). Encouraged by the preliminary data, we generated another batch of rshDPP4 shown to inhibit MERS-CoV infection in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 3B ) to repeat the experiment. We gave groups of 3 DPP4 +/\u2212 mice either 100 or 400 \u03bcg of rsh-DPP4, or PBS (as control) 2 hours before and 24 hours after virus infection as before. To determine if administration of rshDPP4 would increase the circulating levels of shDPP4, serum levels of shDPP4 in mice prior to and 2 hours after the first administration and before challenge with MERS-CoV were measured. We found that titers at 0 and 2 hours of Tg mice given 100 \u03bcg (6.6 \u00b1 0.4 versus 6.6 \u00b1 0.9 \u03bcg/mL), were similar to those of PBS-treated mice (7.5 \u00b1 0.8 versus 7.3 \u00b1 1.0 \u03bcg/mL). However, mice treated with 400 \u03bcg of rshDSPP4 showed significantly increased titers 2 hours after treatment (6.6 \u00b1 0.6 increased to 13.7 \u00b1 0.8 \u03bcg/mL; P = .002, t test). These results suggest that an increased serum level of shDPP4 can be achieved by administration of rshDPP4 in a dose-dependent manner.",

This finding is consistent with the reduced potency of batch 2 of rshDPP4, as shown in Figure 3B . However, the histopathology in mice treated with the high dose of rshDPP4 (ie, 400 \u03bcg) was reduced as well when compared to that of the PBS controls (data not shown).",

We also found that hDPP4 +/+ mice had significantly higher levels of shDPP4 in their circulation than did hDPP4 +/\u2212 mice ( Figure 2 ). Moreover, these higher serum levels of shDPP4 exhibited higher titers of neutralizing activity against MERS-CoV in Vero E6 cell-based assays. Finally, we showed that administration with functionally active rhsDPP4 proteins (Figure 3 ) enabled hDPP4 +/\u2212 mice to better resist MERS-CoV infection in a dose-dependent manner (Table 1) , a finding in accordance with increased levels of shDPP4 in their circulation. Taken together, these results support the notion that increasing the levels of shDPP4 is a potential option for counteracting MERS-CoV infection and disease in humans.",

            "text": "DPP4, ubiquitously expressed on many types of cells and tissues, has been well characterized as critically involved in regulating many important physiological functions, in part through its intrinsic enzymatic activity and propensity to interact with other key regulatory molecules of the immune system [3, 13] . As the functional receptor that mediates entry of MERS-CoV to permissive host cells, the membrane-associated hDPP4 plays a pivotal role in MERS-CoV infection and disease. However, specific role(s) that shDPP4 might have in MERS pathogenesis remain much less understood. While the levels of sDPP4 vary significantly, even among healthy individuals, it has been shown that the intensities of sDPP4 expression in the circulation, along with its intrinsic enzymatic activity, could be a factor in dictating the severity of many human diseases, including malignancies, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, diabetes mellitus and other metabolic syndromes, and chronic infectious disease such as AIDS and hepatitis C [4, 10, 11, 14, 15] . It has been recently reported that serum levels of sDPP4 expression in confirmed MERS patients were significantly reduced when compared to those of healthy individuals [16] ; however, the suggestion that these reduced levels could serve as biomarkers for susceptibility requires knowledge regarding the levels in MERS cases before onset of infection and disease. In addition, further studies of the therapeutic value of shDPP4 as either a significant resistance factor or a potential countermeasure for MERS-CoV in humans is warranted. Of note, the soluble forms of the viral receptors for several other viruses, including those caused by SARS-CoV, rhinovirus, and HIV, have been proposed as potentially effective antiviral therapeutics [17] [18] [19] .",

Whether the significantly higher shDPP4 expression of hDPP4 +/+ mice could be solely accountable for its greater resistance to MERS-CoV infection through functioning as receptor decoys seems unlikely, because it took at least 12.5 \u03bcg of rsh-DPP4, a level higher that the approximately 8 \u03bcg/mL in sera of hDPP4 +/+ mice, to significantly inhibit MERS-CoV infection in Vero E6 cells ( Figure 3B ). Additional studies are needed to better understand the shDPP4-related protective mechanisms against MERS-CoV, especially those of the immune system. However, the validated direct correlation between the level of shDPP4 and the susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection, as shown in this study, may provide a possible genetic basis for the observed wide spectrum of diseases, ranging from asymptomatic, mild-to-moderate, to severe infection and death, in MERS patients [20, 21] .",
