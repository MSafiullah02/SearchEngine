We also searched the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database and Wanfang Data using the same terms in Chinese. We found several epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, management, and outcomes studies regarding the epidemiology and clinical features of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2. We identified no reports on management of pregnant women with COVID-19 and scarce evidence of mother-to-child vertical transmission.\nAdded value of this study\nWe assessed the incubation period, clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, chest CT scans, maternal and fetal management, therapeutic schedule, and maternal and fetal outcomes of full-term pregnant women confirmed to have COVID-19 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. With intensive, active management, the outcomes of the pregnant women and neonates were good. Although one neonate was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 36 h postpartum, up to the follow-up day, no pneumonia and other clinical symptoms and signs were found in all seven neonates. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first evidence that clinical features of COVID-19 in full-term pregnant women were similar to those of non-pregnant adult patients with COVID-19 and outcomes were good following intensive active management of the disease.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nThe outcomes observed in late pregnancy appear very good In light of all the evidence and we suggest that intensive, active management might be best practice in the absence of more robust data.\n",

The neonatal birthweights and Apgar scores were normal. Four infants were taken home and were not tested for SARS-CoV-2; no fever, pathological jaundice, or other symptoms were reported during the follow-up call at 28 days after birth. Another three infants remained for observation in the neonatology department and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Nucleic acid test for the throat swab of one neonate (child of patient 1) was positive at 36 h after birth; nucleic acid tests for the other two were negative. Subsequently, this infected neonate was transferred to Wuhan Children's Hospital, a designated hospital for children infected with COVID-19. After admission, the neonate had no fever and cough, with mild shortness of breath symptoms. Chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary infection. The shortness of breath relieved quickly under neonatal care and monitoring. The neonate was discharged after 2 weeks following two consecutive negative nucleic acid test results. At 28 days after birth, the remaining three neonates were healthy and had no respiratory symptoms or fever (table 2\n).",

In our study, most patients were treated with ribavirin, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Although remdesivir and other antiviral drugs have been used in the clinical treatment of patients with COVID-19, no data of their safety and efficacy as COVID-19 treatments have been published. No safety concerns have been identified related to the use of traditional Chinese medicine in our study. Five of our patients were treated with steroids (methylprednisolone 1\u20132 mg/kg per day); however, animal studies have shown that the use of large doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy might lead to fetal malformation, and some studies have shown that the easy passage of corticosteroids through the placenta might increase the incidence of low birthweight in infants.14 Therefore, steroids were only used after caesarean section in this study. Thus far, no complications related to the steroids have been recorded in the mothers and infants, but their safety still needs more data to draw conclusions. Because of alterations in hormone levels and decreased lung volumes caused by increases in uterus size during pregnancy, patients might have a more rapid clinical deterioration. Additionally, the influence of the virus itself and these antivirals and Chinese medicines on fetal development is unknown. Therefore, for full-term pregnant women, after consultation with a multidisciplinary team, delivering as soon as possible might be a better choice for the sake of safety considerations. Timely use of antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infections and strengthen immune support treatment can reduce complications and mortality, so antibiotics were used routinely after operation.15 COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnancy is a complicated clinical scenario, and a multidisciplinary team of medical personnel is needed to care for and treat these patients comprehensively. Relevant specialty areas include obstetrics, infectious diseases, internal medicine, paediatrics, anaesthesia, psychology, and infection control. No medical staff had SARS-Cov-2 infections during the whole treatment period.",
