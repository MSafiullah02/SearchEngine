Several public health surveillance systems have been developed for detection and recognition of infectious outbreaks [[5], [6], [7], [8]]. Monitoring and detecting sudden outbreak is important for outbreak of respiratory infectious disease because of high infectivity, fast propagation, and large burden on health care services.",

For respiratory infectious diseases, monitoring the number of patients diagnosed with respiratory infectious disease might be a more accurate indicator to predict respiratory infectious disease outbreak than monitoring the number of febrile patients at ED presentation. However final diagnosis at ED is difficult to collect in a timely manner, resulting in time delay of detection for outbreak. In the NEDIS system, time to complete collection of ED final diagnosis information takes up to 14 days from day of ED admission and differs according to each hospital. By contrast, body temperature is checked for all patients during initial triage after ED arrival, and body temperature informati0n is sent to the central NEDIS server directly with triage information without time delay. Body temperature can be used intuitionally for diagnosis or chief complaint without additional data cleaning and coding procedures.",
