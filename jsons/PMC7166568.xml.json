In addition to targeting only a single gene, the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 technology has been extended to simultaneously disrupt five genes in mouse ESCs with high efficiency in only one step [Wang et al., 2013]. This finding, as well as the later report of a CRISPR\u2010Cas9\u2010mediated inducible mouse modeling platform [Yang et al., 2013], has facilitated the rapid generation of large repositories of ESCs with unprecedented speed and precision [Sanchez\u2010Rivera and Jacks, 2015]. Alternatively, Cas9 and the appropriately designed sgRNA can be directly microinjected or simply electroporated into fertilized zygotes to achieve heritable gene modification. Co\u2010injection of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs into mouse zygotes resulted in up to 80% of the total mice carrying biallelic mutations in the targeted genes; importantly, these models can be generated in only 1 month, a much shorter time than it takes using the conventional method of gene targeting in ESCs [Wang et al., 2013]. Last year, one research team reported the generation of a robust mouse model for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) [Cockrell et al., 2016]. Because small animal models are naturally resistant to MERS\u2010CoV, the authors introduced two human mutations (at positions 288 and 330) into the mouse Dpp4 gene via pronuclear microinjection into fertilized zygotes, making the mice highly susceptible to MERS\u2010CoV infection and replication. This discovery holds great promise in the field of therapeutic design and offers new strategies to combat emerging viruses in the near future.",

Recently, researchers revealed the first CRISPR\u2010Cas9\u2010targeted porcine model by directly injecting the Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex and sgRNA sequences into porcine zygotes [Park et al., 2017a]. Zoology experts from China further extended the application of the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system to monkeys by targeting one\u2010cell\u2010stage embryos [Niu et al., 2014] and have generated primate models for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) [Chen et al., 2015]. These promising CRISPR\u2010Cas9 models, which faithfully recapitulate human disease, pave the way for better understanding diseases and identifying vaccines or drugs that have high efficacy in humans.",

Subsequently, several leading groups have reported CRISPR\u2010Cas9\u2010mediated ex vivo somatic genome editing in mice for modeling hematological malignancies [Chen et al., 2014; Heckl et al., 2014]. These findings highlight the feasibility of using CRISPR\u2010Cas9\u2010based ex vivo genome editing for modeling human cancer. In 2014, the Jacks group successively delivered plasmids encoding Cas9 and sgRNAs directly into murine liver cells in vivo [Xue et al., 2014] and delivered all\u2010in\u2010one lentiviruses expressing the CRISPR components into murine lung cells [Sanchez\u2010Rivera et al., 2014]. Later that year, another group mimicked oncogenic chromosomal translocation (Eml4\u2010Alk) in vivo using an adenoviral\u2010mediated CRISPR\u2010Cas9 delivery system in wild\u2010type mice [Maddalo et al., 2014]. Meanwhile, researchers noted that both viral and non\u2010viral nanoparticle\u2010sgRNA delivery methods are efficient in facilitating genome editing in multiple murine tissues in vivo, including neurons, immune cells and lung endothelial cells [Platt et al., 2014]. In 2016, Science simultaneously published three exciting in vivo somatic gene\u2010editing studies using a mouse model of DMD, a fatal X\u2010linked recessive inherited disease caused by mutations in the human dystrophin (DMD) gene [Long et al., 2016; Nelson et al., 2016; Tabebordbar et al., 2016]. The lack of functional DMD protein leads to progressive muscle deterioration, and no effective treatments have been developed. Using a DMD mouse model harboring the nonsense mutation in exon 23 of the Dmd gene, researchers developed adeno\u2010associated virus (AAV)\u2010mediated CRISPR\u2010Cas9 strategies and restored expression of a truncated DMD variant by excision of exon 23. Amazingly, the amount of DMD expression that could be restored could be enough to provide a potential therapeutic benefit in humans [Koch, 2016], although the safety and efficacy of systemic administration of AAV vectors as well as the risk of off\u2010target integrations still need to be assessed [VandenDriessche and Chuah, 2016]. Overall, these studies empower a broader range of disease modeling applications via CRISPR\u2010Cas9\u2010mediated genome engineering, allowing researchers to uncover fundamental mechanisms in disease initiation, maintenance and procession, and explore the therapeutic potential of the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system to correct disease\u2010causing mutations. The application of CRISPR\u2010Cas9 strategies in the generation of animal models is summarized in Figure 2.",

Because it is a precise and flexible editing tool for complete silencing, CRISPR\u2010Cas9\u2010based mutagenesis has been overwhelmingly applied in biological and biomedical fields throughout the world. Unlike RNA interference (RNAi)\u2010based silencing, which is limited by partial depletion of target gene levels, CRISPR\u2010Cas9 enables a complete loss of gene function by NHEJ\u2010mediated error prone repair. Moreover, this system works in all cell culture systems in a similar manner, with the major difference in the delivery methods of the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system [Fellmann et al., 2017]. For example, the transient transfection of plasmids encoding Cas9 and sgRNAs in cells has been reported in many studies [Cho et al., 2013; Cong et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013]; in contrast, virus\u2010based stable delivery is a more efficient way to modify cells [Shalem et al., 2014], especially in the hard\u2010to\u2010transfect blood cells [Tagde et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016a,2016b].",

            "text": "Human cancers are the most targeted diseases using the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 technology because isogenic knockout cells allow for the rapid identification of the causative roles of oncogenes or tumor suppressors, excluding other interferences. In addition, the faster and more economical reprogramming abilities of CRISPR\u2010Cas9 provide exciting opportunities to unravel the mechanisms of drug resistance and to identify potential therapeutic targets. Last year, one research group unveiled the oncogenic features of transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) using a lentiviral\u2010based CRISPR\u2010Cas9\u2010mediated knockout system. They uncovered a positive feedback loop involving TGM2\u2010NFKB signaling, IL6, and autophagy [Zhang et al., 2016a]. Disruption of this network may be a promising therapeutic target and introduce novel strategies to overcome chemoresistance in MCL [Zhang and McCarty, 2017]. Recently, a multicenter team identified a novel mechanistic contribution of the glucose transport inhibitors NR3C1, TXNIP and CNR2 to pre\u2010B\u2010cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) [Chan et al., 2017]. These genes are downstream targets highly induced by PAX5; CRISPR\u2010Cas9\u2010mediated deletion of these genes significantly enhanced glucose uptake and increased ATP levels, revealing an important function of PAX5 as a metabolic gatekeeper and providing promising therapeutic targets. Another illustrative example is the application of genome editing tools to modify chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, which has emerged as a powerful therapy in treating various hematological malignancies [Maus et al., 2014]. To prevent unwanted response from CAR T cell immunotherapy, such as graft\u2010versus\u2010host disease (GVHD) or graft rejection, researchers have attempted to knock out endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) genes using ZFN and TALEN genome editing [Torikai et al., 2012; Qasim et al., 2017]. Last year, one Chinese group was the first to inject CRISPR\u2010Cas9\u2010edited T cells back into a patient that had metastatic lung cancer. The researchers disabled the gene encoding programmed cell death protein 1 (PD\u20101), which prevents T cells from attacking other cells. Without PD\u20101, the edited T cells will defeat and attack the cancer; however, the efficacy of CRISPR\u2010enabled attack has not been fully determined until 6 months of observation [Cyranoski, 2016].",

Two recent publications reported unexpected results: researchers showed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) evolution and escape from CRISPR gene\u2010programmed attack due to Cas9/sgRNA\u2010derived mutations [Wang et al., 2016a,2016b]. Further deep sequencing analysis showed that such mutations are generated by cellular NHEJ mutagenesis at the cleavage site. These indels result in a change in the target DNA sequence, thereby preventing sgRNA from binding and ultimately leading to resistance to Cas9/sgRNA [Wang et al., 2016b]. These findings highlight the importance of further strategies and solutions to overcome viral resistance to the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system [Liang et al., 2016].",

One pioneer study established a lentivirus\u2010mediated library containing 73,000 sgRNAs to generate knockout collections for genome\u2010wide screening in myeloid leukemia cells [Wang et al., 2014]. The following year, the same group further identified essential genes required for cell proliferation and survival in four leukemia and lymphoma cell lines [Wang et al., 2015]. Compared with RNAi\u2010based screens, CRISPR\u2010Cas9 screens achieve robust hits and exhibit significantly lower false\u2010negative rates [Munoz et al., 2016]. Nonetheless, one study highlighted the importance of combining data from both CRISPR\u2010Cas9 and RNAi screens [Morgens et al., 2016]. In this study, the authors performed parallel CRISPR\u2010Cas9 and RNAi screens to identify essential genes in the human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line K562. Although CRISPR\u2010Cas9 and RNAi screens achieved similar levels of precision, numerous identified genes were not overlapped in these two screens. This observation suggests that CRISPR\u2010Cas9 and RNAi screens can detect distinct aspects of biology; one plausible reason is that certain genes that are only partially knocked down lead to totally different phenotypes compared to those resulting from complete loss via knockout. More recently, one team from Stanford University developed a CRISPR\u2010based double knockout system that can disable two genes at one time in cells. Using this modified system, they knocked out 21,321 pairs of drug targets in K562 leukemia cells and identified synthetic lethal drug target pairs. This work demonstrates a promising high\u2010throughput CRISPR\u2010based screening tool to determine functional pairwise genetic interactions [Han et al., 2017].",

            "text": "One should keep in mind that genotoxic stress can be induced by large numbers of DNA breaks when performing CRISPR\u2010based LOF screening. Two independent experiments noted that genome targeting by CRISPR\u2010Cas9 in highly amplified regions leads to increased DNA damage and a profound anti\u2010proliferative response, revealing an unanticipated class of false\u2010positive hits [Aguirre et al., 2016; Munoz et al., 2016]. These findings are alarming for CRISPR\u2010based screening in highly amplified loci. In this regard, appropriate sgRNA design and careful control to not make excessive genomic cuts are urgently needed. Another important challenge for the CRISPR\u2010Cas9\u2010mediated knockout system is cell lethality at an early stage caused by the loss of essential genes. One solution is to use temperature\u2010sensitive mutant alleles, which have recently been well\u2010described [Housden et al., 2017]. The inducible CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system provides an alternative option to identify the biological functions of critical genes [Zhang and McCarty, 2016].",

            "text": "Compared to NHEJ\u2010mediated gene disruption, HDR\u2010induced gene correction has a broader application spectrum, although the HDR pathway is less efficient in mammalian cells. Human inherited disorders such as \u03b2\u2010hemoglobinopathies (i.e., \u03b2\u2010thalassemia and sickle cell disease) [Dever et al., 2016; Traxler et al., 2016; Ye et al., 2016; Park et al., 2017b], anemias [Bluteau et al., 2016; Osborn et al., 2016], and coagulation disorders [Guan et al., 2016; Park et al., 2016] represent ideal targets for CRISPR\u2010Cas9\u2010based gene therapy because the partial restoration by gene correction is sufficient to reverse the symptoms. In addition to blood disorders, which have been extensively discussed in detail [Zhang and McCarty, 2016], other disease\u2010causing mutations can be precisely targeted and corrected using CRISPR\u2010Cas9. In 2013, one group repaired a mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductor receptor (CFTR) locus via HDR in primary intestinal stem cells derived from cystic fibrosis patients that had a single\u2010gene hereditary defect [Schwank et al., 2013]. Later, HDR\u2010induced gene correction was successfully applied to efficiently correct the mutations and phenotypes in mouse models of hereditary tyrosinemia [Yin et al., 2016, 2014], hearing loss [Mianne et al., 2016] or eye diseases [Kim et al., 2017]. Recently, one research team fully replaced, instead of excised, a defective mutation by introducing AAV\u2010mediated CRISPR components and a DMD homology region in a mouse model of DMD [Bengtsson et al., 2017]. Indeed, this approach allows for the replacement of a mutation with a correct sequence. Regardless, moving CRISPR\u2010Cas9\u2010based gene correction from the bench to the clinic has a long way to go. Reasons for this are that (i) the human immune system may recognize the corrected proteins as foreign and thus eliminate the proteins by cytotoxic T lymphocytes; (ii) the phenotype of the edited cells may not fully reflect the actual response in humans since epigenetic and microenvironment alterations are not considered through simple ex vivo or in vitro experiments; and (iii) despite successful modeling in vivo, many uncertain safety issues and delivery efficiency remain unaddressed in humans [Fellmann et al., 2017; Housden et al., 2017].",

            "text": "To expand the potential of the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system, Weissman's group introduced two mutations at the RuvC and HNH sites of the Cas9 endonuclease and created a catalytically inactive Cas9 protein (dCas9) that had no endonuclease activity. This repurposed CRISPR\u2010dCas9 system is called CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and this system efficiently represses the expression of targeted genes by directly blocking transcription initiation or elongation with no off\u2010target effects [Qi et al., 2013]. Unlike the permanent genetic modifications induced by Cas9 endonuclease, CRISPRi\u2010mediated gene repression is inducible and reversible, offering an adjustable platform for RNA\u2010guided transcription regulation [Qi et al., 2013]. To achieve enhanced transcription regulation, the researchers fused dCas9 to either repressor domains such as KRAB (Kr\u00fcppel associated box) or activator domains such as VP64 (four copies of the VP16 activators) and p65 (p65AD), resulting in a system capable of repressing (CRISPRi) or activating (CRISPRa) the transcription of target genes [Gilbert et al., 2013] (Fig. 3a). This CRISPRi/a approach was further optimized to control the transcription levels of endogenous genes, including non\u2010coding transcripts, across a high dynamic range; more importantly, CRISPRi/a can be used to rapidly screen for both LOF and gain\u2010of\u2010function (GOF) phenotypes in a pooled setting, providing complementary information for mapping complex pathways that has not yet been achieved [Gilbert et al., 2014]. In contrast, Konermann et al. [2015] developed an independent CRISPRa system mediated by a synergistic activation mediator (SAM) complex consisting of multiple distinct transcriptional activators, thus achieving robust gene upregulation mediated by a single sgRNA. These advances facilitate whole\u2010transcriptome control in the human genome and help discover therapeutic targets through genome\u2010scale CRISPRi/a screening [Heckl and Charpentier, 2015]. Amazingly, repression and activation of genes can be simultaneously achieved using programmed scaffold RNAs (scRNAs) that encode both target DNA and regulatory effectors [Zalatan et al., 2015]. This strategy enables the simultaneous control of multiple genes in the same cell by turning on one set of genes while turning off another set, thus offering a wide range of biomedical and biotechnological uses [Koch, 2015].",

Meanwhile, multiple animal models, such as worms and zebrafish [Long et al., 2015; Rossi et al., 2015], have been successfully generated using CRISPRi. Soon after these studies in simple organisms, this approach was further exploited to precisely modulate endogenous gene expression in human breast cancer cells [Shen et al., 2016] and in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)\u2010derived neurons [Heman\u2010Ackah et al., 2016]. Recently, one group from Netherlands compared the performance of CRISPR, CRISPRi, and a traditional short hairpin RNA (shRNA) system in their abilities to identify essential genes in human bladder cancer cells [Evers et al., 2016]. Interestingly, they found that the CRISPR\u2010based knockout system outperformed the CRISPRi\u2010 and shRNA\u2010based technologies in discriminating hits from non\u2010hits in functional genetic screens because of its low noise, absence of off\u2010target effects and better consistency across cell lines.",

In addition to the typical dCas9\u2010VP64 activator, other \u201csecond\u2010generation\u201d activators have been tested across multiple cell types and species [Chavez et al., 2016]. In particular, three activators, SunTag [Tanenbaum et al., 2014], VPR (VP64\u2010p65\u2010Rta) [Chavez et al., 2015], and SAM [Konermann et al., 2015], appear to be the most potent systems compared to dCas9\u2010VP64. This study provides an extensive set of systems to generate more reliable tools for improved activation, especially for the highly repressed genes, although most uses of the CRISPRa method have thus far been limited to preliminary function studies [Hu et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2017; Koirala et al., 2017]. Very recently, a group from the University of Oxford reported on the novel design of a spacer\u2010blocking hairpin (SBH) structure at the 5\u2032 end of sgRNA [Ferry et al., 2017]. This strategy can abrogate the function of CRISPR transcriptional activators.

In 2015, two groups fused dCas9 with the histone demethylase [Kearns et al., 2015] or acetyltransferase p300 [Hilton et al., 2015] to target enhancers or promoters, thus leading to robust changes in gene expression. Another group targeted dCas9\u2010KRAB to the distal enhancer of DNase I\u2010hypersensitive sites (DHS), resulting in highly specific histone methylation at the enhancers and decreased chromatin accessibility at both the enhancer and its associated promoters [Thakore et al., 2015]. Recently, one team developed a CRISPR\u2010based tool to specifically increase CpG methylation by fusing dCas9 with the catalytic domain of the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A, enabling methylation of a larger part of promoters in the genomes of mammalian cells [Vojta et al., 2016]. Furthermore, CRISPR\u2010based epigenomic editing has recently been used in high\u2010throughput LOF/GOF screens of regulatory elements in the human genome, serving as a highly scalable platform for epigenomic engineering [Klann et al., 2017]. These studies strengthen the potential of the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system to target regulatory regions rather than the target gene itself and provide a powerful tool for dissecting the regulatory networks that coordinate gene expression (Fig. 3b).",

            "text": "Beyond gene editing and regulation, another urgent challenge in the field of cell biology is efficiently labeling and tracing specific DNA sequences within live cells, although conventional fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has been developed during the last few decades. To overcome these hurdles, scientists have further repurposed the CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system as a genome imaging tool for imaging live human cells [Chen et al., 2013]. This CRISPR imaging system, consisting of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)\u2010tagged dCas9 protein and an optimized sgRNA, has enabled the robust imaging of repetitive elements in both telomeres and protein\u2010coding genes and allowed for the visualization of arbitrary non\u2010repetitive genomic sequences in the human genome (Fig. 3c). Undoubtedly, this new CRISPR\u2010based imaging technology serves as a complementary approach to FISH, allowing simpler and more direct tracking of telomere dynamics, subnuclear localization and chromatin organization throughout the cell cycle. The same system was later reported in live mouse embryonic stem cells [Anton et al., 2014]. Unlike the previous study that mainly focused on detection sensitivity [Chen et al., 2013], Anton et al. [2014] performed a thorough comparison of the CRISPR\u2010based imaging method with the 3D\u2010FISH and immune\u2010labeling methods and explored the potential applications of using the CRISPR\u2010based imaging technology in high resolution microscopy studies. Later that year, Tanenbaum et al. [2014] developed a synthetic SunTag system to recruit up to 24 copies of GFP to a target polypeptide chain. Using a modified dCas9 tagged with the SunTag, the authors created nearly 20\u2010fold brighter fluorescent signals than those resulting from the dCas9 directly fused to GFP, thus providing a magnified fluorescence imaging platform in live cells. Subsequently, dCas9 variants fused with different fluorescent proteins were introduced into human U2OS cells, allowing for the simultaneous detection of multiple colors in genomic loci with high spatial resolution; the distance between two loci on the same chromosome was also mapped using this same strategy [Ma et al., 2015]. In addition, one group achieved imaging of low\u2010 and non\u2010repetitive chromosome loci by integrating a sgRNA with up to 16 MS2 motifs to enable robust fluorescent signal amplification [Qin et al., 2017]. Recently, researchers even painted an entire chromosome by introducing hundreds of specific and non\u2010repetitive sgRNAs in a live cell for fluorescence imaging; amazingly, the arrangements of the homologous chromosomes as well as the movement of a particular chromosome in dividing cells could be clearly visualized [Zhou et al., 2017]. Overall, a CRISPR\u2010based imaging tool facilitates modeling spatiotemporal dynamics in different cell stages and enables a panorama of interactions between genomic loci within live human cells.",

This system enables Cas9 to recognize and cleave RNA targets in a programmable fashion and facilitates direct transcript detection [O'Connell et al., 2014]. On the other hand, this system may be a helpful alternative when RNAi cannot be used for RNA degradation [Ghodsizadeh, 2014]. Last year, the same group further developed RNA\u2010targeting Cas9 (RCas9) as a fluorescence\u2010based probe to track RNA in live cells [Nelles et al., 2016] (Fig. 3c). This innovative strategy allows RCas9 to recognize RNA while avoiding the encoding DNA; importantly, the subcellular distribution of RCas9 was highly correlated with RNA\u2010FISH, depicting the ability of RCas9 to track the trafficking and localization of RNA in living cells. This RCas9\u2010based method lays a solid foundation for transcriptome editing by CRISPR\u2010Cas9 and enables scientists to measure diverse transcript types in multiple cell systems and manipulate target RNA, not only by detecting RNA but also by altering RNA modifications [Burgess, 2016]. In addition to the type II CRISPR\u2010Cas9 system, scientists have uncovered the features of type I CRISPR\u2010Cas systems, which comprise approximately 90% of all CRISPR\u2010Cas loci identified in bacteria and archaea, and can target both DNA and RNA [Makarova et al., 2017]. Beyond tracking RNA in live cells, future developments of the RCas9 system, such as the modulation of multiple RNA\u2010processing steps, the generation of disease modeling, and the promotion of clinical translation, deserve further exploration.",

Successful bench\u2010to\u2010bed translations rely on efficient delivery systems and refined administrative procedures to target human diseases with high specificity. In this respect, applying CRISPR\u2010Cas9 editing to large animal species, such as dogs, pigs, or non\u2010human primates, will help gain better understanding of human diseases and provide a more comprehensive safety report and therapeutic strategies. One should note that adaptive evolutionary changes in pathogens, such as viruses, may develop anti\u2010CRISPR strategies to escape from CRISPR\u2010mediated attack, resulting in treatment failure. Despite these unaddressed barriers, CRISPR\u2010Cas9\u2010enabled functional research has strengthened our grasp of potential underpinnings of the initiation and development of human diseases. More inspiringly, novel editing tools such as Cas9\u2010fused deaminases [Komor et al., 2016] or Cpf1 nucleases [Zetsche et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2016a] have demonstrated the unlimited possibilities of using CRISPR technology for genome editing, defining an unprecedented path to the next generation of transformative therapies and treatment in the foreseeable future.",
