In minimally invasive operations that require CO2 insufflation, depending on the insufflator used, filtration may or may not occur during the entirety of the case. Knowing the viral particle size of COVID-19 ranges from 0.06 to 0.14 microns, the primary concern arises if improperly sized filters are utilized to evacuate smoke plumes. This means that during the progress of a laparoscopic or robotic operation, CO2 enters in via an inflow cannula and either the CO2 remains trapped intraabdominally (along with aerosolized virus), or it is recirculated through the insufflator, filtered, then exhausted through the back of the insufflator as room air. If a CO2 insufflation filter (or a handheld suction device in an open operation) is too large to capture the smaller RNA viral particles, aerosolized viral particles are essentially being concentrated within the exhaust and then expelled out of the rear of the insufflator.",

CONMED Corporation\u201d). This open-circuit should be avoided to circumvent a jet-like stream of aerosolized virions within the pneumoperitoneum. CON-MED has published mitigation strategies by using constant negative pressure smoke evacuators on other valved ports, but this does not stop valveless trocar leak, it only tries to minimize it.
