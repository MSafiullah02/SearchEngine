            "text": "The major physiological function of milk is the transport of amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, and minerals (especially calcium) to mammalian offspring. In addition to its nutritional importance, milk also contains a variety of molecules, which provide protection against pathogen infections or modulate immune responses. Antibodies are the most prominent of these molecules, but other nonspecific, broad-spectrum defense substances possess antimicrobial activity as well. Some of these molecules can be altered to improve the antipathogenic properties of milk. These modifications are of particular interest if no suitable vaccines are available and newborn mammals are most severely affected by the infection. This scenario can be the consequence of the low virulence of the pathogen, which does not elicit a major immune response in the adult host [e.g. the human respiratory syncytia virus (RSV)], or the variability of the pathogen, which evades an immune response targeted at variants encountered previously (e.g. influenza virus). Under these circumstances, mothers do not supply protective antibodies to their offspring via placenta and milk and nonspecific defense mechanisms may be too weak to prevent disease. This in turn puts the offspring at an increased risk of infection, as the immune system of newborn mammals is often not sufficiently developed during the early stages of life to cope efficiently with the pathogens. Milk, which has been manipulated to contain large amounts of specific or nonspecific defense substances, may therefore provide a useful tool for disease prevention in these instances.",

            "text": "There is convincing evidence that with regard to infant health, breast-feeding is superior to bottle-feeding Filteau, 2000, Hanson et al., 2000, Hanson, 1998. Protection against infections during lactation has been demonstrated in cases of acute and prolonged diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, otitis media, urinary tract infection, neonatal septicemia, and necrotizing enterocolitis (Hanson, 1998). Breast-feeding provides the newborn baby with a battery of immunologically active substances Table 1, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5\n. Antibodies have been demonstrated to efficiently control a variety of pathogen-induced diseases (including malaria, Fried et al., 1998, Kassim et al., 2000), and a wide variety of virus infections (e.g. RSV, Englund, 1994, and rotavirus, Ebina et al., 1992). Lactoferrin, which is present in substantial amounts in human milk, prevents the population of the infant's gut by coliform enterobacteria and acts as an antiinflammatory immune modulator (Nuijens et al., 1996). Other nonspecific defense molecules enhance this protection Newburg, 1996, Labeta et al., 2000. These substances are of particular importance in the newborn prior to acidification of the stomach, which provides an effective barrier to many bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal tract in later life. In addition, there is growing evidence that the transfer of cytokines, growth factors, B-cells, and other lymphocytes from mother to offspring via milk (Zhou et al., 2000) assists the development of the infant's immune system. Babies, who are not breast-fed, are deprived of some of these defense mechanisms. The antibodies in cow's milk will be directed against bovine rather than human pathogens. Bovine lymphocytes even if they would survive the processing of milk to infant formula would be of no benefit to humans. Cow's milk contains very little lactoferrin (Nuijens et al., 1996). In addition, many babies show allergic reactions to cow's milk, with \u03b2-lactoglobulin being the major immunogen (Pecquet et al., 2000).",

            "text": "However, even breast-feeding fails to supply adequate protection against a variety of pathogens. This is exemplified by the frequent hospitalization of children (below the age of 6 months) infected with RSV. Although the levels of maternal antibody are inversely correlated with the severity of RSV-induced disease (broncholitis and pneumonia; Lamprecht et al., 1976), most mothers transfer negligible amounts of virus-neutralizing antibodies to their children. This is a consequence of the minor immune reaction that RSV elicits in adults with most infections being subacute. Available vaccines do not lead to a long-lasting immune response. The first RSV vaccine (using formalin-inactivated virus) even resulted in an increased incidence and severity of disease in vaccinated children (Englund, 1999). Therefore, although RSV-specific antibodies in milk are able to control RSV-induced disease, they are usually scarce. In a scenario like this, it is obvious that the manipulation of antimicrobial substances in milk would have beneficial health effects.",

Some pathogens elicit a major immune response and a long-lasting immunity. Other pathogens only lead to a transient immune response. In this case, the antibody content of human milk can be manipulated by immunizing mothers during pregnancy. This can be done as a passive immunization by infusing preparations of pathogen-specific antisera or, more frequently, as active immunization by vaccination. Vaccination in pregnancy leads to a normal immune response and no pregnancy-specific side effects have been reported Englund et al., 1998, Munoz and Englund, 2000. This approach is particularly useful in cases (like RSV), where vaccination only leads to a short-term immune response and infants can be seriously affected by the infection. Immunization of mothers during pregnancy with RSV antigen leads to the transfer of antibodies to the offspring via placenta and colostrum and helps to prevent RSV-induced disease Englund, 1994, Englund et al., 1998. A potential drawback to this approach may relate to the finding that maternal antibodies can suppress the infant's own immune response to certain pathogens (Englund et al., 1998). Therefore, careful analysis of the host\u2013pathogen interactions is required before embarking on vaccination during pregnancy. Nevertheless, immunization during pregnancy may help to prevent a wide spectrum of diseases.",

Transgenesis circumvents the problem of differences in isotype usage in milk. Cows mainly produce IgG, whereas human milk mainly contains IgA (Larson, 1992). IgG can activate complement via its Fc portion and is very potent against bacteria, whereas IgA (due to its dimeric nature) has a strongly neutralizing effect against viruses. Humanized IgA molecules can theoretically be produced in the milk of transgenic ruminants. The concentration of the recombinant antibody present in milk would exceed the levels of antibodies generated by vaccination by some orders of magnitude. Antibody concentrations of 10 mg/mL have been obtained in transgenic goats (Pollock et al., 1999), while the total immunoglobulin content of ruminant milk is about 1 mg/ml.

Transgenesis will lead to milk containing only one monospecific antibody directed against a single epitope (in contrast to vaccination, which leads to a whole battery of pathogen-specific antibodies). Pathogens are often able to evade the neutralizing effect of an antibody by mutating the recognized protein domains. Therefore, antibodies expressed in the milk of transgenic animals will have to be selected carefully, so that they are directed against essential epitopes, which cannot be mutated without impairing infectivity (Sola et al., 1998). Transgenesis in ruminants is also expensive and time consuming. The market for milk as a nutraceutical containing a recombinant, pathogen-neutralizing antibody may be therefore only profitable enough for some exceptional human pathogens with worldwide significance. The biggest disadvantage of transgenic technology will be the current adverse public perception. However, the transgenic approach may find public approval in the area of animal health where it could partly obviate the need for antibiotics.",

            "text": "The porcine coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) illustrates the possible application of transgene-mediated modification of milk as a means to prevent disease. TGEV causes gastroenteritis and diarrhea in pigs (Enjuanes and van der Zeijst, 1995). Newborn animals are most severely affected by the infections with a mortality of up to 100%. Coronaviruses in general elicit an immune response that is highly strain-specific and often short-lived. Although a variety of routes were investigated to obtain useful vaccines against TGEV, no marketable vaccine has been developed yet. Oral administration of neutralizing antibody has been shown to efficiently prevent TGEV infection (Torres et al., 1995). Milk containing this neutralizing antibody may therefore provide a route to protecting piglets against TGEV infections Sola et al., 1998, Castilla et al., 1998. To provide a proof of principle, a mouse model for this approach was established (Fig. 1)\n. Transgenic mice, which express a highly neutralizing antibody directed against a murine coronavirus (the mouse hepatitis virus MHV-JHM) in the lactating mammary gland, were generated. Newborn mice suckling the milk of transgenic dams were fully protected against a challenge with a lethal dose (7000\u00d7LD50) of MHV-JHM. Cross-fostering experiments demonstrated that the milk-borne recombinant antibody was sufficient for this protection (Kolb et al., 2001). Although there are differences in the disease pattern elicited by MHV and TGEV and the immunoglobulin isotypes typically found in the milk of mice and pigs, these experiments demonstrate that modification of milk via a transgenic route can have a very beneficial impact on animal health.",

            "text": "Lactoferrin is a glycosylated milk protein, which is also found in other mucosal secretions and is expressed in neutrophils. It possesses a wide variety of antimicrobial functions (Table 3)\n. Its actions against viruses, bacteria, and fungi can be classified into several different modes of action. (1) By sequestering free iron, lactoferrin can restrict the growth of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and a variety of fungi Kuipers et al., 1999, Cirioni et al., 2000, Andersson et al., 2000. The bacteriostatic effects can be counteracted in vitro by addition of excess iron. (2) Lactoferrin and (even more potently) its pepsin-breakdown products lactoferricin B and H (from bovine and human lactoferrin, respectively), which are derived from the N-terminus of the protein, have a bacteriocidal effect by interfering with bacterial membrane function (Hwang et al., 1998). Lactoferrin's activity against fungal infection in vitro and in vivo Kuipers et al., 1999, Bellamy et al., 1993, Wakabayashi et al., 2000 may have the same biochemical basis. (3) Lactoferrin can also bind bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), thereby impairing bacterial cell wall/membrane function Nuijens et al., 1996, Odell et al., 1996. By binding free LPS or LPS bound to other proteins, it can also act as an antiinflammatory immune modulator Baveye et al., 1999, Baveye et al., 2000. (4) Lactoferrin purified from milk and colostrum is able to block human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) replication as well as inhibit HIV-1-induced cytopathic effects. Negatively charged lactoferrin derivatives obtained by acylation of the amino function of lysine residues even had a fourfold stronger antiviral activity against HIV-1 but lost their anti-hCMV activity. Native and acylated lactoferrin strongly binds to the V3 domain of the HIV envelope protein gp120, suggesting that the shielding of this domain results in the inhibition of virus\u2013cell fusion and virus entry. Addition of positive charges to lactoferrin by amination resulted in an increased anti-hCMV activity and a loss of anti-HIV activity (Swart et al., 1998). (5) Lactoferrin also inhibits the entry of hepatitis virus C (HCV) into susceptible cells by direct interaction with the viral surface glycoproteins (Ikeda et al., 1998). Pilot studies in HCV-infected patients, however, only demonstrated a moderate antiviral activity in vivo (Tanaka et al., 1999). Whereas the antibacterial effects of lactoferrin probably reflect a natural function, the antiviral activities may be fortuitous. However, lactoferrin, \u03b1-lactalbumin, and \u03b2-lactoglobulin, which can also be derivatized to yield compounds with strong anti-HIV activity (Swart et al., 1996), may provide lead structures for the development of antiviral drugs (Swart et al., 1999).",

The 25 amino acid lactoferricin peptide folds into a distorted antiparallel \u03b2-sheet, whereas the N-terminal 13 amino acids in the native lactoferrin adopt a \u03b1-helical structure (Hwang et al., 1998). The bacteriocidal effect of lactoferricin is far greater than that of native lactoferrin (Bellamy et al., 1992). Two tryptophan residues in the bovine lactoferricin peptide are indispensable for this activity (Strom et al., 2000). Although lactoferricin has been shown to depolarize bacterial membranes Aguilera et al., 1999, Ulvatne et al., 2001, the precise basis of its antimicrobial action remains unclear. In order to induce the activity of lactoferricin in milk, the pepsin cleavage site may be engineered to be recognized by a protease, which is resident in the lactating mammary gland. This may boost the antibacterial potency of milk and reduce the number of bacteria (especially enterobacteria, which are particularly susceptible to lactoferricin action) in milk. These manipulations, however, would probably alter the processing abilities of milk. In addition, the modified milk may also have an unwanted immunogenic/allergenic effect.",

Isracidin is a chymosin cleavage product of bovine \u03b1S1 casein encompassing amino acids 1\u201323 (Fig. 2)\n. It possesses strong antibacterial activity (at concentrations similar to that of penicillin) and was found to be effective against a variety of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Lahov and Regelson, 1996). Surprisingly, isracidin is most potent when injected intramuscularly in vivo but only displays a modest antibacterial activity in vitro. This suggests that the effect of isracidin may be indirect. Therefore, it is uncertain whether transgenic overexpression of an isracidin-peptide in the lactating mammary gland would increase the antibacterial potency of milk. The chymosin cleavage sites in \u03b1S1 casein are conserved in ruminant proteins but not in other mammals, indicating that the formation of isracidin may not be essential for the well-being of mammals in vivo (Fig. 3)\n. Although isracidin may not augment the antibacterial properties of milk, transgenic expression may nevertheless be useful, as large-scale production of isracidin was mainly hampered by the lack of suitable production systems (the peptide had to be isolated from milk after chymosin treatment). Production of larger amounts of isracidin in the milk of transgenic animals could be achieved either by expressing it as a peptide or by introduction of a cleavage site for a mammary-resident protease.",

Although some of these activities are fortuitous, milk may provide a cheap source for the production for these agents. In addition, a wide variety of immunomodulatory substances are found in milk (Goldman, 2000; Table 5). Examples include interleukins, transforming growth factors \u03b1 and \u03b2, or the complement regulatory protein CD59 (Bjorge et al., 1996). Some of the abovementioned molecules (e.g. lactoferrin and isracidin) also possess immune modulatory activity. Little is known about the precise role of these proteins in the mother or in the offspring (Goldman et al., 1996). However, the importance of these factors is exemplified by the fact that TGF-\u03b2 knockout mice, which die shortly after birth, can be rescued by TGF-\u03b2 supplied by maternal sources (via placenta and milk; Letterio et al., 1994). As the precise significance of these factors is not established, they are not likely candidates for targeted manipulation.",

            "text": "There are two routes for the manipulation of immunologically active, protective components of milk: vaccination and transgenesis (Table 2). Vaccination of mothers during pregnancy requires a careful consideration of potential risks and benefits for each pathogen in question. Vaccination of ruminants can lead to the production of milk highly enriched in antibodies directed against particular pathogens Ebina, 1996, Freedman et al., 1998. Since antibodies in milk are relatively stable (Schmidt, 1982), formula containing antibodies directed against a variety of pathogens can be generated and used for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases of the digestive tract. The modified milk will have its major application in infectious diseases, which are acute but not life-threatening and do not lead to hospitalization. However, the economic value of this strategy may be considerable. In addition, the time span between the occurrence of a new pathogen (or a new variant) and the development of a vaccine may be shortened significantly by DNA vaccination. DNA vaccines have been effective in many instances (Turnes et al., 1999) and lead to the production of pathogen-specific antibodies in colostrum and milk (Jenkins et al., 1999). Manipulation of milk by transgenesis will be useful in the veterinary field. Milk containing either a defined, highly neutralizing antibody directed against a pathogen or a high concentration of a nonspecific defense molecule may be applied for the prevention of infectious diseases, when suitable vaccines are unavailable. This approach, however, will be subject to a stringent cost-benefit analysis. The transgenes encoding the antipathogenic molecules will not be integrated into the conventional breeding programs but used for the generation of a herd of animals, which provides modified milk as a product (Whitelaw, 1999).",
