One of the reasons is that, in a language such as English, it is difficult to pronounce more than three consecutive consonants. If you need more letters, then you should make sure that you have enough of a balance between vowels and consonants for easy pronunciation. A common trick is to tailor the acronym to an already existing word, as exemplified by SQUID. Quite a few scientists have had a field day turning loaded words into acronyms, such as PENIS standing for an algorithm used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR for short). Make sure that, whenever an acronym first appears in a publication, it is flanked with its translation. But make as little use of acronyms as possible. They clutter a text, they hinder the flow of reading, they are eyesores and tongue-twisters, they are a necessary evil.

It may well be that the author, having a more ideographic mindset, does not wish to go beyond the piece of datum to an interpretation. The referee, whose outlook is nomothetic, finds such behavior myopic at best and takes the author to task for not attempting to rise from the observation to the underlying law of nature.

The Renaissance was also the time for the appearance of anatomical plates: they made possible diffusion of brand-new knowledge about the body, ushering-in a revolution in medical thought and in surgical practice. The seventeenth century witnessed an innovation of lasting value and consequences, the insertion in books of diagrams for concepts. Both Newton and Descartes, among quite a few other authors, made use of such illustrations. As for the Enlightenment, it created its own versions of diagrams as tools for thought. This was the time when the first bivariate plots and the first histograms were published (William Playfair, Jean-Henri Lambert).",

            "text": "From the mid-seventeenth century on, a key role of scientific illustration was to display the otherwise invisible. Robert Hooke was the pioneer, when he published in 1665 his Micrographia, i.e., an atlas of plates drawn from viewing a wide diversity of specimens through the microscope. John Dalton, about 1805, illustrated his atomic theory with schematic representations of atoms in molecules. Fox Talbot, one of the co-discoverers of photography, entitled The Pencil of Nature the portfolio of photographs which he published in 1844. The notion he advocated was that nature, through this novel means, was able to express herself and to draw her self-portrait -a remarkably naive statement. Eadward Muybrige, in 1887, with another album of photographs, collecting series of still pictures shot at short intervals, Animal Locomotion, was able to analyze movement and to describe accurately the strides taken by, e.g., a galloping horse. Just a few years later, R\u00f6ntgen, with his famous Xray picture of a hand, would depict in 1895 the ability of his new rays to penetrate matter and to image, as it were, its innards. A year later, Becquerel with his picture of a key would extend it to the mysterious rays emanating from salts of some heavy metals. All such pictures, from Hooke to Becquerel, demonstrated the uncanny power of science, for depicting reality in ways never seen before. Scientific images replaced the mythical images of yesteryear, the mermaids and the unicorns of legend, with novel sources of wonder.",

The first is documentary, to show that something is real, that it can serve as a piece of evidence. The second function of an image is methodological, when it depicts an experimental set-up, an apparatus. The third, non-identical with the first, is persuasive: an image shows that a model matches, more or less, the data. The fourth is also a little different; it has anteriority over the one just mentioned: heuristic use of a diagram, such as an histogram or a regression line, to try and make sense of the data. The fifth is to use an image as a short-hand for a description in words: a flow-chart plays such a role. Finally, an image often serves to communicate to the viewer the quality of the work done, in a rhetoric of excellence (one-upmanship and self-promotion at work).",
