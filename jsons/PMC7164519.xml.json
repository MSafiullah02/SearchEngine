Initially affecting residents of Wuhan, China, in late December 2019, COVID-19 rapidly spread to every country on the globe. The consequences of this rapid spread, leading to patients with significant symptoms (particularly respiratory dysfunction or failure) to seek medical care in hospitals which, in normal circumstances, were already functioning at capacity. This surge of acute ill patients put a significant stress on the already overwhelmed health care system globally [1].",

As occurs in any other pandemic or mass casualty event, some patients with regular medical and surgical problems still require medical care. Many of those medical or surgical conditions may be treated at a later time when the pressure of COVID-19 eases; an example may include a myriad of general surgery problems treated electively [4]. To that end, many specialty societies have published their recommendations regarding postponement of what is considered \u201cregular\u201d or \u201celective\u201d care [5, 6]. However, emergency general surgery conditions and trauma cases still require immediate assessment and timely resolution.",
