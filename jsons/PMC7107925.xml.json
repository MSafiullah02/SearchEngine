Another high-risk population is the healthcare workers who may have close contacts with patients with symptomatic or asymptomatic A(H7N9) infection. A number of healthcare workers were infected, through contacts with patients, by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a novel human coronavirus causing outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\u2013like illness in Middle East and Europe, although there is no confirmed evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV, like SARS-CoV [6].",

A hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using guinea pig red cells and pseudoviruses expressing hemagglutinin of a representative A(H7N9) strain (A/Hangzhou/1/2013) was conducted for determining the HI titers of the serum samples, as previously described [7].",

These results also implied that A(H7N9) might not be able to cause asymptomatic or subclinical infection. To the best of our knowledge, no case of asymptomatic A(H7N9) infections have been reported so far. This also suggests that people may be unable to acquire H7N9-specific immunity through asymptomatic or subclinical A(H7N9) infection, which may explain why people lack population immunity against A(H7N9) viruses. However, more extensive serological investigation on the asymptomatic or subclinical A(H7N9) infection among different high-risk groups at different regions should be performed.",
