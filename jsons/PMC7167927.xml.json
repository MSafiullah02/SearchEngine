Worldwide, respiratory infections give rise to more disease and death than any other human infection and are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality (121). Seasonal influenza in the USA is estimated to result in more than 200,000 hospitalizations and 36,000 deaths annually (218). The great \u2018Spanish flu\u2019 influenza pandemic of 1918\u20131919 caused 20\u201350 million deaths worldwide and an estimated 675,000 deaths in the USA, affecting mostly young adults and not the usual children and old individuals. At the peak, half of the world\u2019s population was clinically infected. During the influenza pandemic years of 1918\u20131919 (type A influenza, subtype H1N1) and 1957\u20131958 (type A influenza, subtype H2N2), the incidence of secondary bacterial pneumonia, the most common cause of excess mortality during influenza outbreaks, varied between 2 and 18% in different populations (123). The influenza A (swine flu) pandemic of 2009 involved a novel H1N1 strain. The main bacteria in influenza\u2010associated pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae, alpha\u2010hemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (123). A combined infection with influenza viruses and S. aureus causes particularly severe and fatal pneumonia in both children and adults (29). Respiratory viruses other than the influenza viruses can also interact pathogenically with bacterial pathogens, for example human parainfluenza virus with S. pneumoniae (50) and adenovirus with Bordetella pertussis (185). A study of community\u2010acquired childhood pneumonia revealed that mixed viral\u2013bacterial infections, which comprised about 75% of the pneumonias studied, resulted in more severe inflammation and clinical illness than single viral or bacterial infections (87).",

            "text": "Viruses can induce alterations in the respiratory tract, which allow resident bacteria to multiply to levels capable of inducing inflammation (6). Respiratory tract viruses can inhibit the ciliary activity of the respiratory epithelium and thereby increase the risk for bacterial superinfection (6). Respiratory cells infected with influenza A virus, respiratory syncytial viruses or adenoviruses show enhanced bacterial adherence in both in vitro and in vivo model systems (69). The influenza virus may predispose to secondary bacterial pneumonia by denudating the respiratory epithelium and exposing basement membrane elements (e.g. fibrinogen) to which bacteria can attach (47, 123). An influenza virus infection can also cause prolonged desensitization of lung sentinel cells to toll\u2010like receptor ligands, resulting in a reduced presence of neutrophils and an increased secondary bacterial load (39). In addition, alteration of neutrophil functions by the influenza virus may decrease the clearance of pulmonary bacteria (97, 104).",

Otitis media is often associated with viruses, such as rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus (232), cytomegalovirus (238) and other herpesviruses (20), as well as with bacteria, including H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, and Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus species (19). Acute otitis media with a tympanostomy tube showed S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, H. influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and yeast (166). Viruses were detected in 65% of acute otitis media samples that were positive for H. influenzae, in 77% of samples that were positive for S. pneumoniae and in 73% of samples that were positive for M. catarrhalis (170). Tympanic membrane changes with acute otitis media are more severe in patients co\u2010infected with respiratory viruses and bacteria than in patients who have a single infection with either of the two types of infectious agents (237). Viruses interact with bacteria in acute otitis media to boost the local inflammatory process and also have a profound adverse effect on resolution of the disease (75).",

            "text": "Other human diseases seem also to have a combined viral\u2013bacterial etiopathogeny. Recurrent bacterial sinusitis may develop as a complication to viral colds (5). Infectious mononucleosis caused by infection with Epstein\u2013Barr virus can give rise to tonsillar upgrowth of Prevotella intermedia and Fusobacterium nucleatum, and subsequently pharyngotonsillitis (18). The Lemierre\u2019s syndrome, which is characterized by severe pharyngitis and sepsis, can occur as a sequel to Epstein\u2013Barr virus\u2010induced mononucleosis and is frequently associated with an overgrowth of Fusobacterium necrophorum (53). Gastroenteritis is often associated with mixed infections of viruses (rotavirus, adenovirus, norovirus, astrovirus) and bacteria (pathogenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter jejuni), and the combined viral\u2013bacterial infection can lead to enhanced pathosis (117). Appendicitis has been associated with measles virus, adenovirus and herpesviruses, as well as with Bacteroides fragilis, E. coli, Yersinia, Salmonella and Shigella (91). In Helicobacter pylori\u2010associated gastritis, the activation of a latent Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection by monochloramine from infiltrating neutrophils can aggravate the gastric disease (128). In organ transplant recipients, cytomegalovirus and human herpesviruses type 6 or type 7 can induce serious opportunistic infections with bacteria, fungi, protozoa and other viruses, probably as a result of immunomodulation by the herpesviruses (12, 137, 150). A renal transplant patient developed a subhepatic abscess as a result of infection with cytomegalovirus and P. gingivalis (103). Vascular diseases occur at a higher frequency as a result of a combined infection with herpes simplex virus and Chlamydia pneumoniae (165) or periodontopathic bacteria (224) than from a single infection with either of these agents. Rheumatic heart disease and autoimmune myocarditis may involve dual infection with coxsackievirus and group A streptococci, which have the potential to dysregulate immune mechanisms and trigger an autoimmune reaction (167). HIV infection causes a variety of severe bacterial, fungal and viral infections (46, 100, 174, 242). Moreover, P. gingivalis may up\u2010regulate expression of the HIV\u20101 R5\u2010specific co\u2010receptor CCR5 in oral keratinocytes and thereby increase the risk for oral infection and dissemination of R5\u2010tropic HIV\u20101 strains (58). Also, various gram\u2010positive and gram\u2010negative bacteria of the periodontitis biofilm have the capacity to re\u2010activate HIV in latently infected T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells (80), and the vaginosis bacteria Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, but no other vaginal bacteria studied, are potential activators of HIV expression in monocytoid cells and T\u2010lymphocytic cells (72).",

            "text": "Animal models have been used to study viral\u2013bacterial interactions. Respiratory pathosis was enhanced in mice when the influenza virus or other viruses co\u2010infected with bacteria (198). In a mouse model of pathogenetic synergy, an influenza virus infection antecedent to an S. pneumoniae challenge caused pneumonia and led to 100% mortality, whereas an infection with S. pneumoniae prior to an influenza virus infection provided protection from influenza and improved survival rates (123). Immune mediators, including cytokines and chemokines, through toll\u2010like receptors/mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase pathways, seem to play important roles in the pathogenesis of the influenza virus\u2013S. pneumoniae co\u2010infection (184). Calves dually infected with bovine respiratory syncytial virus and Haemophilus somnus, both bovine respiratory pathogens, contracted lung disease and harbored H. somnus in the lungs, whereas the lungs of monoinfected calves showed neither pathosis nor H. somnus infection (57). Acute otitis media was induced in 63% of mice that had been stably colonized by S. pneumoniae and then infected with the influenza virus, whereas all mock\u2010infected mice remained free of disease (122). Mice infected with herpes simplex virus, adenovirus or vaccinia virus revealed enhanced susceptibility to E. coli pyelonephritis (59). Mice inoculated intraperitoneally with murine cytomegalovirus together with P. aeruginosa, S. aureus or Candida albicans exhibited mortality rates of 80\u2013100%, whereas immunization against murine cytomegalovirus abrogated the synergistic effect on mortality for all combinations of the infectious agents studied (70). In immunocompromised rats, a symptomatic infection with rat cytomegalovirus induced severe neutropenia and subsequently a high rate of enteric gram\u2010negative rod bacteremia (201). A markedly higher mortality rate was found in mice co\u2010infected with murine cytomegalovirus and P. gingivalis than in mice mono\u2010infected with either cytomegalovirus or P. gingivalis (203). A significantly lower level of systemic interferon\u2010gamma was detected in the dually infected mice than in the mono\u2010infected mice, suggesting that P. gingivalis was able to reduce the antiviral interferon\u2010gamma response and thus increase the pathogenicity of the co\u2010infecting cytomegalovirus (203).",

Early studies on viral\u2013bacterial synergism emphasized a decreased clearance or an enhanced pathogenicity of the bacteria involved in the infectious complex, but more recent investigations also point to the possibility of an increased virulence of the virus. As millions of herpesviruses and bacteria can inhabit individual periodontitis sites (179), it is reasonable to assume that herpesviral\u2013bacterial interactions also play a role in the development of human periodontitis.",

Because pathogen loads typically peak during periods of active disease, herpesvirus recovery from periodontal sites depends greatly on the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis. The difficulty of defining periodontitis for the purpose of research was recently pointed out (156). The use of patient age as a main criterion for distinguishing between \u2018aggressive\u2019 and \u2018chronic\u2019 periodontitis may not be a reliable indicator of active or stable disease. The term \u2018normal\u2019 periodontal site is sometimes used to suggest absence of attachment loss rather than inflammation\u2010free gingiva. As herpesviruses may enter even slightly inflamed periodontal sites, sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques may show viruses in \u2018unhealthy\u2019 control sites. Conversely, periodontal therapy can markedly reduce herpesvirus subgingival counts and thus cause a significant underestimation of the viral load associated with untreated disease (177). Reliable data on the prevalence and quantity of periodontal herpesviruses may require study of virgin lesions with a well\u2010defined disease\u2010activity status.",

Viral isolation indicates an active and possibly disease\u2010producing infection, but isolation of viruses is difficult, costly and time\u2010consuming. High\u2010fidelity PCR\u2010based techniques have become the standard for identification and quantification of periodontal herpesviruses (99, 146), and the transcription of late herpesvirus genes for structural proteins is understood to signify productive viral replication and is commonly used to indicate an active herpesvirus infection (60, 124). PCR identification of oral herpes simplex virus may yield two\u2010 to fourfold more positive samples than viral culture (42, 227). Nested PCR may unveil more periodontal sites that are positive for cytomegalovirus than viral culture or real\u2010time PCR (16) or end\u2010point detection PCR (23). Nested PCR technology is particularly efficient in detecting low viral loads (168). However, PCR primers that amplify templates of microbial communities at different efficiencies may yield biased results (86). Misamplification and false\u2010positive herpesvirus results may emerge when there are shared regions of nucleotide sequences between herpesvirus species and unknown infectious agents. Nevertheless, as periodontal Epstein\u2013Barr virus and cytomegalovirus have been identified using a variety of PCR primers in platforms of end\u2010point detection PCR, nested PCR, reverse transcription PCR and real\u2010time PCR, the risk of a systematic misidentification of these viruses is small. However, different PCR primers and protocols may detect herpesviruses with a varying degree of proficiency (28), and technical expertise and quality assurance methods vary among laboratories (102, 144, 183). Preparation of the target nucleic acid constitutes a particularly vulnerable stage of PCR protocols.",

An active (\u2018productive\u2019) cytomegalovirus infection tends to be associated with periodontal sites showing no radiographic evidence of alveolar crestal lamina dura (211, 219), a finding consistent with disease\u2010active periodontitis (158). An active cytomegalovirus infection has also been linked to increased gingival inflammation in immunosuppressed organ\u2010transplant recipients (141). An acute herpes simplex virus\u2010type 1 infection in a 26\u2010year\u2010old patient caused, within a few hours, extensive gingival recession (155).

Periodontal Epstein\u2013Barr virus and cytomegalovirus seem to be most closely associated with P. gingivalis and T. forsythia (179), two bacteria with high periodontopathic potential (78). The link between cytomegalovirus and P. gingivalis appears to be particularly strong (193). Cytomegalovirus and P. gingivalis were linked to localized aggressive (juvenile) periodontitis in Jamaica with odds ratios of 4.6 and 7.8, respectively, but the cytomegalovirus\u2013P. gingivalis dual infection was linked to the disease with an odds ratio as high as 51.4 (125). The significantly higher odds ratio of the cytomegalovirus\u2010P. gingivalis co\u2010infection than of the sum of the individual pathogens is suggestive of a pathogenetic synergy between the infectious agents. A study, in the USA, of 140 adults with gingivitis or periodontitis, linked Epstein\u2013Barr virus\u20101 and cytomegalovirus to elevated occurrence of the pathogens P. gingivalis, T. forsythia, P. intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Treponema denticola (Table 3).

Periodontal Epstein\u2013Barr virus (179, 207) and cytomegalovirus (85, 125, 140, 219) have also been related to the subgingival presence of the major periodontopathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.

A low level of interferon\u2010gamma was found despite the capacity of cytomegalovirus to trigger the induction of interferon\u2010gamma, and despite the ability of bacterial lipopolysaccharide, via cytokine simulation, to induce interferon\u2010producing CD8+ T cells (160). Adding further to the complexity, cytomegalovirus encodes genes capable of inhibiting the interferon response and antiviral processes (37).",

It is likely that the early stages of periodontitis in immunologically na\u00efve hosts involve an active herpesviral infection that primarily causes cytopathogenic effects, whereas most clinical manifestations in immunocompetent individuals are secondary to cellular or humoral immune responses. The proposed model may help to clarify at least some of the clinical features of periodontitis (179, 189). The propensity for site tropism of herpesviruses may explain why periodontal tissue destruction can differ markedly from tooth\u2010to\u2010tooth in the same patient or from surface\u2010to\u2010surface in individual teeth. A vigorous anti\u2010herpesvirus host defense may ensure a prolonged period of periodontal stability, even in the presence of virulent bacteria.
