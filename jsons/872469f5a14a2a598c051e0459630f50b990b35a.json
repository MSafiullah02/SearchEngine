            "text": ", Norden E. Huang, Fangli Qiao and Ka-Kit Tung presented a \"data-driven model\" for the COVID-19. The different relevant functions like N (t), the number of newly infected at times t, the time at which N (t) peaks and the peak value, can be seen to depend on a set of seven parameters most of which are assumed to be known that is, obtained from a statistical analysis of the available data. These parameters are not independent, they are linked through a set of relations the authors call \"Main Results\" which are validated by a statistical analysis of the data. The parameters in questions and the relations between them are not always explicitated by the authors. By given them here their mathematical formulations, which are rather simple, all the relevant functions can be explicitely written down. Once the \"Main Results\" of the authors are accepted, all the explicit formulas follow from the fact that ln N (t) is a quadratic function of time: ln N (t) = at 2 + bt+ c where a and b are two of the basic parameters resulting from a statistical analysis of the data and obviously c = ln N (0). The formulas presented here are not themselves approximations -but the parameters they involve are of course statistical quantities derived from the data. They could maybe be of some use either to validate the data, the model itself, to update the model or to find approximations to the relevant quantities. The matematics involved is at the level of elementary calculus and no claim is made to either mathematical originality or profundity. This piece of work is not intended as a criticism of the model put forth by Norden E. Huang, Fangli Qiao and Ka-Kit Tung which, for all intent and purposes, we take here for granted. Its validation is a matter of what happens out there. It is rather a set of elementary remarks on the mathematical structure of the model itself, remarks which could maybe be of some interest.",

First, the accuracy of the predictions depends on the accuracies of the evaluations of the structural parameters; evaluating four of them and calculating the \"exact values\" of the remaining three in function of the first four might hold the accumulated errors down. Second, evaluating all of the seven structural parameters from a statistical analysis of the data and injecting these values in the relations between them will of course show that these relations only approximately hold -since we have here approximative values of the seven parameters.

The discrepancy between the two definitions of R(t), and which one should be used, are discussed in [2] , lines 139-142. 2 who were admitted in hospital at time t have either recovered or are dead at time t + T . One of the basic assumptions in [2] is that at any time t, the number of those that have either recovered or are dead at time t + T is exactly the number of those who were admitted in hospital at time t. The obvious a priori problem with T is that we have to wait for the epidemic to have completed its full course to figure out its value but, in [2] , we are told that the value T can be validated by a statistical analysis of the data from which its values can be evaluated. Even without a statistical analysis, the value of T can be explicitely from 4 of the parameters using any of the relations (10), (11) or (12) which invole parameters whose \"values are known\", the words in [2] .",
