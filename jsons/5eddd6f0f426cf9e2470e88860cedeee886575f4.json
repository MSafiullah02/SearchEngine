Owing to the rapidly aging population, our government established a plan (LTC version 2.0) in 2017 to better integrate the community-based LTC system, incorporating both health care and disability prevention 5 . As part of this LTC system, home care aides (HCAs) deliver support services, such as cooking, feeding, bathing, and toileting to people in their homes. They are like the \"ears and eyes\" of the LTC system. HCAs can obtain information on the changing health status of care recipients by following up on their health outcomes 6 . HCAs could then contact the care recipients home-based physician regarding their medical needs, which may help ease the pressure on hospitals and emergency services and prevent the spread of infection.",

A new sick leave policy has been implemented that allows ill HCAs to stay at home. If an HCA travels internationally, they are not allowed at work for 14 days. Personal protective equipment including surgical masks, gloves, gowns, and eye protection were also supplied. Additionally, the government has provided surgical masks every week since March 2020 (5 pieces per person per week).",
