            "text": "Viral pneumonia is common in both paediatric and adult populations, with influenza virus type A and B accounting for the majority of cases in immunocompetent hosts, while cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus as well as adenovirus dominant in immunocompromised hosts [1]. In 2003, an epidemic of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) worldwide had led to the recognition of coronavirus, with its characteristic high infectivity and associated severe morbidity [2]. In 2008, an outbreak of pneumonia in a local regional institution (Castle Peak Hospital) in Hong Kong had raised initial concern and suspicion of SARS return in view of similar clinical and radiological features, only later viral serology revealed identification of metapneumovirus. Indeed, the clinical and radiological findings in viral pneumonias are variable and frequently overlapping [1]. Specific-organism diagnosis often cannot be made on the basis of imaging features alone. Therefore, recognition of various radiological manifestations of viral pneumonias together with clinical history is imperative for narrowing the differential diagnosis. In this article, we reviewed the frequency and compared the differences of thoracic parenchymal findings on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) between SARS and metapneumovirus pneumonia in the initial course of the disease.",

Those who were diagnosed to have SARS but did not have HRCT study performed or HRCT performed 10 days after onset of symptoms were excluded. A total of 55 patients were identified with SARS and treated in our institution (Tuen Mun Hospital) during 2003. 17 patients were excluded as either CT study was not performed or performed 10 days after onset of symptoms. Hence, only 38 patients (23 females, 15 males) were included in our study, with a mean age of 39.6 years \u00b1 14.5 years [SD] (range 19\u201377 years old).

Those who were diagnosed to have metapneumovirus infection but did not have HRCT study performed were excluded. A total of 4 patients were identified with metapneumovirus infection from another local institution (Castle Peak Hospital) during May 2008 and were all (4 males) included in our study, with a mean age of 52.3 years \u00b1 6.7 years [SD] (range 47\u201362 years old).",

The overall anatomic distribution (segmental, lobar or patchy), zonal predominance (upper, middle or lower zones) and extent (focal or multifocal) of the lesions were also recorded.

Conventional chest radiography is usually the first imaging technique performed but with lack of sensitivity [8]. Past studies demonstrated that HRCT was the most sensitive imaging method for detecting early lung changes in acute pulmonary diseases [7], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Characteristic CT findings in SARS include ground glass opacification or consolidation, thickening of the interlobular or intralobular interstitium, and crazy paving appearance [3], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], with a peripheral and lower lobe predominance in the early course of the disease, progressing to diffuse and bilateral involvement in the latter stage [13], [15], [18]. On the other hand, characteristic CT findings in metapneumovirus infection include patchy areas of ground glass attenuation, small nodules, and multifocal areas of consolidation in a bilateral asymmetrical distribution [4], [5], [6], [7]. Despite so, these findings are nonspecific and can be found in other types of bacterial or viral/atypical pneumonia such as Mycoplasma, Chlamydia or Legionella [18], [19], [20], [21]. Ground glass attenuation, in particular, is a pattern of low specificity yet most commonly seen in respiratory viral infection, regardless of cause [1].",

The presence of centrilobular nodules, parenchymal band and consolidation are significantly more frequently present in metapneumovirus infections. Pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy and cavitation, in the contrary, were of consistent rare features in both groups. Bronchiectasis however occurred much more often in the metapneumovirus group while crazy paving pattern and septal lines occurred significant more frequently in the SARSs group. These two features, therefore, can be used as markers in differentiation between the two groups of patients during initial phase of the disease. Despite this seemingly positive finding, one should remember that these are nevertheless nonspecific and can be found in other types of viral pneumonia. In particular, bronchiectasis, although not a feature in initial stage of SARS, can occur during the healing phase in relation to fibrosis formation [15], [22], [23]. Correlation with clinical history and other parameters is therefore important in search for a diagnosis.",

The overlapping CT features indicates difficulty in obtaining high accuracy in differentiation between the two groups, as well as between other respiratory viral infections or even from other diseases such as acute extrinsic allergic alveolitis, bronchioltis obliterans with organizing pneumonia or chronic eosinophilic pneumonia [1]. Predictive values are also likely to be low. Nevertheless, these findings, when present, should alert clinician to the possibility of respiratory viral infection and prompt the referring physician to search for the diagnosis and treatment plan. Clinical information is indispensable and microbiological test remains the gold standard in making diagnosis.",
