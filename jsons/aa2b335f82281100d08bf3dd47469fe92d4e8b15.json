            "text": "COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, resulting in nearly three hundred thousand deaths distributed heterogeneously across countries. Estimating the infection fatality rate (IFR) has been elusive due to the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections and lack of testing capacity. We analyze global data to derive the IFR of COVID-19. Estimates of COVID-19 IFR in each country or locality differ due to variable sampling regimes, demographics, and healthcare resources. We present a novel statistical approach based on sampling effort and the reported case fatality rate of each country. The asymptote of this function gives the global IFR. Applying this asymptotic estimator to cumulative COVID-19 data from 139 countries reveals a global IFR of 1.04% (CI: 0.77%,1.38%). Deviation of countries' reported CFR from the estimator does not correlate with demography or per capita GDP, suggesting variation is due to differing testing regimes or reporting guidelines by country. Estimates of IFR through seroprevalence studies and point estimates from case studies or sub-sampled populations are limited by sample coverage and cannot inform a global IFR, as mortality is known to vary dramatically by age and treatment availability. Our estimated IFR aligns with many previous estimates and is the first attempt at a global estimate of COVID-19 IFR. : medRxiv preprint PCR-based tests with the number of individuals with a detectable SARS-COV-2 immune response in sampled populations [17] . Universally, seroprevalence surveys confirm the presence of unreported infections, though the extent of the unreported infections and associated adjustment to IFR is debated due to the non-random nature of population sampling, low sample size, and questioned 35 specificity of serological assays. Case studies reporting IFR from whole population sampling, such as the Diamond Princess cruise where all patrons were tested and the calculated IFR is near 2% are not necessarily representative of global demographics, incomes, or healthcare availability [7, 18]. In the absence of high resolution information of case demographics, seroprevalence, or stan-40 dardization of healthcare and underlying risk factors to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, there exists no method to assess the global IFR. A robust estimate is essential to inform policy and interventions [8, 19] . We provide a new statistical approach to estimate the global IFR using reported data, despite variability in reporting and risk factors. Differences in reported country-level 45 CFR from the estimator are compared to national demographic and economic profiles to determine whether the reported CFR reflects known risk factors for COVID-19 mortality.",

High CFR are generally associated with restricted access to testing due to low test availability, such that only individuals with marked COVID-19 symptoms -typically those of older age or with pre-existing conditions, and thus at higher risk of death from COVID-19 -receive testing [9, 13, 14, 20] . Greater testing capacity allows 55 individuals with mild symptoms or those with suspected exposure to receive testing.

In an estimate of 0.1% probability of mortality in a 2 week window due to existing comorbidities, the probability that death of an 230 infected patient with a pre-existing condition is primarily due to the existing condition is less than 10% (SI 6). In this case, the reported CFR needs to be adjusted to 90% of its value. In light of this, the vast majority of SARS-COV-2 positive deaths are due in whole or primarily to COVID-19. High reported CFR values are a result of under-counting of positive infections rather than over-235 counting COVID-19 associated deaths. This contrasts needed adjustments in deaths associated with influenza, as the lower IFR of active influenza infections leads to a higher coincidence of mortality due to chronic disease and infection relative to the incidence of influenza associated mortality alone. In some localities it is estimated that COVID-19 associated deaths are under-reported by 240 25-50% because these deaths occur outside of a hospital setting [26] . Underreporting of deaths is likely to outweigh over-reporting due to comorbidities in many localities.",

Best estimates rely on standardized 260 global reporting practices, though this method is robust despite differences. Of note, some countries have yet to report deaths, and more have yet to report the number of tests administered, including China.

This number is lower than the IFR for the Diamond Princess cruise (2%), whose demography was skewed toward older individuals [18] . The older age of this sample may be partially counterbalanced by the higher income and access to healthcare of the majority of these individuals than the global average. Na-275 tional surveys performed in Iceland have estimated an IFR below 0.6%, which is among the most randomized testing conducted in any nation, though much of these cases have affected a younger group than is representative of the nation [27] . A previous estimate of IFR in China of 0.66% aligns well with projections from Iceland [19] . Seroprevalence studies have inferred widely different 280 estimates of IFR, including a non-random sample of Santa Clara county residents in CA that suggested an IFR of 0.12-0.2% [17] . NYC seroprevalence of grocery shoppers suggests approximately one of every 5 NYC residents has been exposed. Because 0.15% of NYC residents had died from COVID-19 at the time the study was conducted, seroprevalence results yield a city-wide IFR of 0.75%. 285 ",

Although randomized seroprevalence surveys will provide the most accurate measurement of local IFR, these surveys cannot be conducted on a global scale, especially if the results of these surveys are to be used proactively to inform control strategies. Much of the current 290 local estimates of IFR are representative of high income areas with high access to treatment. Higher IFR is possible in areas where surveys have not been conducted due to disparity in healthcare access or testing [21] .

We estimate the IFR for Italy as 1.91% (SI 7), which is higher than a recent estimate of 1.29% provided by Rinaldi and Paradisi from early data but within their credible interval [29] . The IFR for Italy is likely higher than for countries of equivalent GDP and healthcare access due to the spike in cases that occurred in March 2020 that exhausted 305 hospital resources in the northern regions. Proper control measures and testing can minimize infection spikes to levels that hospitals can manage, reducing the IFR.",

Because cumulative data 530 from Italy used in the global analysis presented in the main text was taken on April 21, 2020, this may explain the deviation of Italy from the expected curve. 4 weeks past the peak, data for Italy at the end of April is sub-optimal and predicts a higher CFR relative to capacity compared to countries that have yet to peak. April 21, 2020 remains a good choice for a single date measurement 535 36 .

            "text": "Future estimates should focus on obtaining CFR and capacity measurements of cumulative data at the peak of each country's epidemic. Best estimates also occur if testing capacity, as defined in the main text, is approximately constant over time. This indicates that the number of tests available keeps pace with 540 growth and waning of case loads in the country. Variation in this relationship will not dramatically impact results, as cumulative data approximates the average over time. However, dramatic swings in testing capacity or testing protocol may impact reliability of estimates. Particular to this study, by April 21, most countries with reported deaths had experienced a few weeks or months of the 545 pandemic. For these countries, estimates of the relationship between CFR and capacity are more reliable, particularly for the countries for which peaks in daily mortality had occurred. Several countries had few reported deaths and a growing case load due to later introduction of COVID-19 to the country or differences in control strategies. For these countries, estimates as applicable in 550 a global regression will improve over time. The result of this approach can be updated to account for better estimates as the pandemic continues, though the global IFR is unlikely to fall far outside of the 95% confidence interval reported here. Italy provides a good example of the use of the approach developed in this study, as the epidemic growth occurred quickly, such that a peak is easily 555 defined, and a range of dates near the peak is optimal for obtaining cumulative data and performing a regression. Doing so for Italy (at March 23, 2020), produces Figure S3 .",

For a discrete process whereby sampling of the population for COVID-19 cases occurs iteratively, such that a defined subsample of the population is tested in each iteration, the proportion of the population sampled can be denoted z. Each subsample, t, changes the available prevalence of cases in the finite population when information is available to bias sampling 345 in favor of testing COVID-19 positive individuals. This information exists because of the presence of symptoms or suspicion of exposure to infection. The bias associated with the information is denoted \u03bb > 1. When \u03bb = 1, sampling is random. Bias can be defined as the fold increase in likelihood of sampling an infected individual relative to sampling an uninfected individual. The preva-350 lence of COVID-19 positive individuals in the unsampled population can be represented by r t where r 0 = prev is the true prevalence (prior to sampling without replacement) in the population. Each iteration, t, is not by definition a time-dependent index. Rather, it is related to the number of tests conducted on the finite population, and is thus associated with sampling effort. When the 355 population size is fixed, t can be indirectly related to time by way of the time taken to conduct t rounds of tests. The following relation can be found:",
