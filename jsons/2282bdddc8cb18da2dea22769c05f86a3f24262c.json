This systematic review included people with MM criteria as participants (two or more 29 chronic conditions in the same individual). The type of outcome included was explicitly defined 30 the length of medical appointments with patients with MM. Any strategies aiming to analyse 31 the impact of MM on the average consultation time were considered.

            "text": "206consultation time spent on patients with MM longer than that spent on patients who do not 207 meet the MM criteria?\" could only identify one study,58 undertaken in Denmark, in which the 208 consultation time was logged as a function of the number of chronic diseases. This study 209 revealed a tendency for consultations to take longer for patients with MM than for those without 210 MM. However, the study was not directly aimed at answering this question and it did not take 211 confounding factors into account. In addition, it does not describe the calculation to determine 212 the sample size of the study and it could be inaccurate to study this specific outcome. So the 213 study was classified as \"Satisfactory\".214The small number of publications in the literature on this subject shows that more 215 studies should be designed to investigate the impact of MM on the consultation length-time. It 216 is vital to analyse this issue in order to manage resources so that they meet the actual need, 217 and to ensure the services provided by health services, national or private, are appropriate. It 218 will thus be possible to guarantee better quality health services and outcomes for these 219 patients. In fact MM is about a patient with more then two chronic diseases or one chronic 220 disease with biopsychosocial factor (associated or not) or somatic risk factor, so illness being221 included and not only about the specific sufferances.1,9 222 In studies with calculated size population representative random samples it is 223 important that accurate methods are used to measure the real length-time of a consultation 224 (i.e. from the moment that the doctor opens the patient's file to the moment it is closed). Using 225 stop-watches and self-reporting will probably lead to inaccuracies. The calculation of the 226 length-time of the consultation obtained by dividing the total time a medical practitioner is in 227 the clinic by the number of patients could yield average times that mask the real duration of 228 each patient's consultation. Also confounding factors must be eliminated as the time spent on 229 administrative work, breaks and work meetings. Only direct observation using video recording be a procedure that mitigates many of the errors previously mentioned. The 232 length-time of a consultation must be measured accurately to avoid errors and skewed 233 judgements. It is essential to identify beforehand any possible confounding factors inherent to 234 the patients (for example, hearing difficulty, education level, age, socio-economic level), 235 inherent to the doctor (in particular, a change in behaviour due to the participation in the 236 research study -Hawthorne effect60), and inherent to the consultation/institution (for example, 237 glitches in computer systems, organization of necessary information in the health informatics 238 records, coding errors, telephone call interruptions). The time lost searching for information in 239 consultation, the friendliness of clinical informatics and the time spent on e.records are also 240 issues to be studied and thought of 61, 62. Health determinants are factors to be studied in such 241 a MM population for better health and social outcomes.63",
