In the United States, nearly 45-million Americans are infected with HSV-2, now the most common cause of genital ulcerations, which increase the risk of acquiring other sexually transmitted infections. Thus, there is an urgent need for preventative HSV-2 therapies. Writing in Nature, Palliser et al.1 report that the process of RNA interference (RNAi) can be harnessed to prevent vaginal transmission of HSV-2 in a rodent model. This study is the first to show that vaginal administration of an siRNA therapeutic can be used prophylactically against a sexually transmitted viral infection both pre- and post-exposure.",

RNAi has quickly become an indispensable laboratory tool for selective knockdown of protein expression in cultured cells; moreover, the therapeutic potential of siRNA, delivered intravenously or locally, is under active investigation (Fig. 1).",

Mutational pressure can perhaps be countered by a cocktail of siRNAs directed at multiple viral genes. Alternatively, host proteins essential for virus entry or replication, such as the HIV-1 chemokine coreceptor CCR5, may also serve as useful siRNA targets.",

Similar studies of chronic use of siRNA will be needed, as long-term dosing is more likely to lead to nonspecific interferon responses and unexpected consequences of gene silencing.

Thus, siRNA administration may lead to side effects through unintentional knockdown of host proteins.",

The greatest advantage of this technology is the speed with which genomic information can potentially be translated into effective therapeutics. siRNA-based therapeutics can be rationally designed as fast as genomic information is made available. They can then be rapidly screened for efficacy in cell culture and in animal models. Their translation into therapeutics suitable for humans will depend upon cost, formulation, a favorable toxicity profile and a convenient dosing scheme. This approach is likely to be of particular importance in the battle against rapidly emerging infectious diseases, such as SARS or avian influenza.",
