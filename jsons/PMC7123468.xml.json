Acute otitis media (AOM) occurs most frequently as a consequence of viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) [2\u20134], which leads to eustachian tube inflammation/dysfunction, negative middle ear pressure, and movement of secretions containing the URTI-causative virus and pathogenic bacteria in the nasopharynx into the middle ear cleft. By using comprehensive and sensitive microbiologic testing, bacteria and/or viruses can be detected in the middle ear fluid (MEF) in up to 96 % of AOM cases (e.g., 66 % bacteria and viruses together, 27 % bacteria alone, and 4 % virus alone) [5]. Studies using less sensitive or less comprehensive microbiologic assays have yielded less positive results for bacteria and much less positive results for viruses [6\u20138].",

When using appropriate stringent diagnostic criteria, careful specimen handling, and sensitive microbiologic techniques, the vast majority of cases of AOM involve pathogenic bacteria either alone or in concert with viral pathogens.",

            "text": "Clinical bacteriology has dramatically changed after the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) [30]. The most commonly identified pathogen is S. pneumonia, which, prior to adoption of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), was isolated in approximately one third to half of all cases [30]. Block et al. studied changes of microbiology after the community-wide vaccination with PCV7 [31]. Comparing each cohort (1992\u20131998 vs. 2000\u20132003), the proportion of S. pneumoniae significantly decreased from 48 to 31 %, and nontypable H. influenzae significantly increased from 41 to 56 %. Post-PCV7, Gram-negative bacteria and beta-lactamase-producing organisms accounted for two thirds and one half of all AOM isolates, respectively. In terms of serotypic change in S. pneumoniae, vaccine efficacy of PCV7 against vaccine-serotype pneumococcal OM was about 60 %. A later report [32] with data from 2007 to 2009, 6\u20138 years after the introduction of PCV7 in the USA, showed that PCV7 strains of S. pneumoniae virtually disappeared from the MEF of children with AOM who had been vaccinated. However, the frequency of isolation of non-PCV7 serotypes of S. pneumoniae from the MEF overall increased; this has made isolation of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae of children with AOM nearly equal. In summary, the licensed 7-valent CRM197-PCV7 has modest beneficial effects in healthy infants with a low baseline risk of AOM. Administering PCV7 in high-risk infants, after early infancy and in older children with a history of AOM, appears to have no benefit in preventing further episodes.",

However, Dagan et al. [35] described the emergence of serotype 19A as a cause of OM prior to the introduction of PCV7 in Israel.

PC-13V utilizes the same protein carrier as vaccine PC-7V, and was released in the United States by the FDA on the basis of immunogenicity and safety studies. Safety was evaluated by means of 13 controlled studies involving thousands of healthy children. It is still early to evaluate the true benefit of PVC 13, and numerous trials are under development. PC-13V is recommended for all children between 2 and 59 months of age and those between 5 and 6 years with risk factors for severe pneumococcal disease. The vaccine is applied in 4 doses at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months of age. Currently, several RCTs with different (newly licensed, multivalent) PCVs administered during early infancy are ongoing to establish their effects on AOM. Results of these studies may provide a better understanding of the role of the newly licensed, multivalent PCVs in preventing AOM.",

Data on nasopharyngeal colonization from PCV7-immunized children with AOM have shown continued presence of S. pneumoniae colonization. Revai et al. [39] showed no difference in S. pneumoniae colonization rate among children with AOM who have been unimmunized, underimmunized, or fully immunized with PCV7. In a study during a viral URTI, including mostly PCV7-immunized children (6 months to 3 years of age), S. pneumoniae was detected in 45.5 % of 968 nasopharyngeal swabs, H. influenzae was detected in 32.4 %, and M. catarrhalis was detected in 63.1 % [40]. Data show that nasopharyngeal colonization of children vaccinated with PCV7 increasingly is caused by S. pneumoniae serotypes not contained in the vaccine [41\u201344]. With the use of the recently licensed 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) [45], the patterns of nasopharyngeal colonization and infection with these common AOM bacterial pathogens will continue to evolve.",

S. pyogenes has been shown to occur more commonly in older children [46] and cause a greater degree of inflammation of the middle ear and tympanic membrane (TM), a greater frequency of spontaneous rupture of the TM, and more frequent progression to acute mastoiditis compared with other bacterial pathogens [46\u201348]. As for clinical findings in cases with S. pneumoniae and nontypeable H. influenzae, some studies suggest that signs and symptoms of AOM caused by S. pneumoniae may be more severe (fever, severe earache, bulging TM) than those caused by other pathogens [29, 49, 50]. These findings were refuted by results of the studies that found AOM caused by nontypeable H. influenzae to be associated with bilateral AOM and more severe inflammation of the TM [51, 52]. Leibovitz et al. [53] concluded, in a study of 372 children with AOM caused by H. influenzae ( N = 138), S. pneumoniae ( N = 64), and mixed H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae ( N = 64), that clinical/otologic scores could not discriminate among various bacterial etiologies of AOM. However, there were significantly different clinical/otologic scores between bacterial culture-negative and culture-positive cases. A study of middle ear exudates of 82 cases of bullous myringitis has shown a 97 % bacteria-positive rate, primarily S. pneumoniae. In contrast to the previous belief, Mycoplasma sp. is rarely the causative agent in this condition [54]. Accurate prediction of the bacterial cause of AOM on the basis of clinical presentation, without bacterial culture of the middle ear exudates, is not possible, but specific etiologies may be predicted in some situations. Published evidence has suggested that AOM associated with conjunctivitis (otitis-conjunctivitis syndrome) is more likely caused by nontypeable H. influenzae than by other bacteria [55\u201357].",

PC-7V has reduced the burden of vaccine-serotype disease as well as shifted the pneumococcal serotypes carried in the nasopharynx toward those with lower disease-causing potential. Antibiotic resistance remains a challenge to successful therapy with ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococci present in the community and increasing emergence of b-lactamase\u2013negative, amoxicillin-resistant NTHi identified globally. The next-generation PC-13V has been introduced, and early data suggest efficacy against invasive pneumococcal disease and carriage of SP19A, the multidrug resistance isolate that has been associated with both treatment failure in AOM 90 and the increasing number of cases of pneumococcal mastoiditis. Promising data on an 11-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine with protein D as a carrier was published in 2006, but additional confirmation of efficacy against NTHi otitis media with the licensed formulation, PHiD-CV (a 10-valent conjugate), is pending data future studies. For NTHI specifically, a number of candidate protein antigens have had progress to human trials since 2007, remains to be demonstrated. Multiple candidates have demonstrated the necessary requirements for candidate vaccine antigens: conservation among isolates, surface exposure, immunogenicity in animals, and protection in animal models of disease or specifically experimental otitis media. Further research of the role of each antigen in the pathogenesis of disease, to elicit response in the youngest infants is likely to be productive and permit more antigens to move into clinical trials.",

In children who have taken amoxicillin in the previous 30 days, those with concurrent conjunctivitis, or those or whom coverage for \u03b2-lactamase-positive H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis is desired, therapy should be initiated with high-dose amoxicillin/clavulanate (90 mg/kg/day of amoxicillin, with 6.4 mg/kg/day of clavulanate, a ratio of amoxicillin to clavulanate of 14:1, given in two divided doses, which is less likely to cause diarrhea than other amoxicillin/clavulanate preparations) [84].",

            "text": "For penicillin-allergic children, recent data suggest that cross-reactivity among penicillins and cephalosporins is lower than historically reported [86\u221289]. The previously cited rate of cross-sensitivity to cephalosporins among penicillin-allergic patients (approximately 10 %) is likely an overestimate. The rate was based on data collected and reviewed during the 1960s and 1970s. A study analyzing pooled data of 23 studies, including 2400 patients with reported history of penicillin allergy and 39,000 with no penicillin-allergic history concluded that many patients who present with a history of penicillin allergy do not have an immunologic reaction to penicillin [88]. The chemical structure of the cephalosporin determines the risk of cross-reactivity between specific agents [87, 90]. The degree of cross-reactivity is higher between penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins but is negligible with the second-and third-generation cephalosporins. Because of the differences in the chemical structures, cefdinir, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, and ceftriaxone are highly unlikely to be associated with cross-reactivity with penicillin [87]. Despite this, the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters; American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; and Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology [91] stated that \u201ccephalosporin treatment of patients with a history of penicillin allergy, selecting out those with severe reaction histories, show a reaction rate of 0.1 %.\u201d They recommend cephalosporin in cases without severe and/or recent penicillin-allergy reaction history when skin test is not available.",

Levofloxacin is a quinolone antibiotic that is not approved by the FDA for use in children . Linezolid is effective against resistant Gram-positive bacteria. It is not approved by the FDA for AOM treatment and is expensive. In children with repeated treatment failures, every effort should be made for bacteriologic diagnosis by tympanocentesis with Gram stain, culture, and antibiotic susceptibility testing of the organism(s) present. The clinician may consider consulting with pediatric medical subspecialists, such as an otolaryngologist for possible tympanocentesis, drainage, and culture and an infectious disease expert, before use of unconventional drugs such as levofloxacin or linezolid.",

Almost all middle ear pathogens derive from the pathogens colonizing the nasopharynx, but not all nasopharyngeal pathogens enter the middle ear to cause AOM. The positive predictive value of nasopharyngeal culture during AOM (likelihood that bacteria cultured from the nasopharynx is the middle ear pathogen) ranges from 22 to 44 % for S. pneumoniae, 50\u201371 % for nontypeable H. influenzae, and 17\u201319 % for M catarrhalis. The negative predictive value (likelihood that bacteria not found in the nasopharynx are not AOM pathogens) ranges from 95 to 99 % for all three bacteria [107, 108]. Therefore, if nasopharyngeal culture is negative for specific bacteria, that organism is likely not the AOM pathogen. A negative culture for S. pneumoniae, for example, will help eliminate the concern for multidrug-resistant bacteria and the need for unconventional therapies, such as levofloxacin or linezolid. On the other hand, if S. pneumoniae is cultured from the nasopharynx, the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern can help guide treatment.",

Thus, for children younger than 2 years and children with severe symptoms, a standard 10-day course is recommended. A 7-day course of oral antibiotic appears to be equally effective in children 2\u20135 years of age with mild or moderate AOM.
