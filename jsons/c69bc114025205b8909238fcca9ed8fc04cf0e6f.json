They refer to many different pathological conditions affecting the pulmonary system in acute or chronic forms, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, infections, cystic fi brosis, lung cancer and many other breath complications. Environmental, epigenetic and genetic co-factors are responsible for these pathologies that can lead to respiratory failure, and, even, ultimately death. Increasing evidences have highlighted the implication of the autophagic pathways in the pathogenesis of lung diseases and, in some cases, the deregulated molecular mechanisms underlying autophagy may be considered as potential new therapeutic targets. This chapter summarizes recent advances in understanding the pathophysiological functions of autophagy and its possible roles in the causation and/or prevention of human lung diseases.",

            "text": "Lung diseases are some of the most common medical conditions in the world. The lung has the principal aim to mediate gas exchange [ 60 ] . For this reason, the lung can be subjected to several insults, belonging to the environment (inspiration of foreign matter, particles, smoke), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, biological origins (e.g., viruses, bacteria), changes in O 2 tension, and mechanical stresses (e.g., mechanical ventilation). It is possible to discriminate between diseases affecting: (I) the airways (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, acute bronchitis and cystic fi brosis); (II) the interstitium (sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis, autoimmune diseases, pneumonias and pulmonary edemas); (III) the blood vessels (pulmonary embolism and hypertension); the pleura (pleural effusion, pneumothorax and mesothelioma); (IV) the chest wall (obesity hypoventilation syndrome and neuromuscular disorders). The development of lung diseases can be associated to both acute and chronic exposure to such insults. However, in most conditions, a favouring genetic is necessary [ 60 ] . Yet, the lung has various inducible defence mechanisms to protect itself. First, constitutive and inducible stress protein and antioxidant defences; second, innate immune responses; third, pro-and anti-apoptotic mechanisms [ 84 , 85 , 103 ] . Several studies have recently pinpointed the emerging role of macroautophagy (more often and hereby referred to as autophagy) in lung homeostasis and diseases. Autophagy is a catabolic process that involves the sequential sequestration of cytoplasmic material within double-membraned vesicles (autophagosomes), the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, and the degradation of autophagosomal cargoes (as well as of structural autophagosomal components) by lysosomal hydrolases [ 26 ] . Autophagy is mediated by a genetically encoded, evolutionary conserved machinery that is connected to most, if not all, major biochemical processes of the cell, including core metabolic circuitries as well as signal transduction pathways initiated by plasma membrane receptors [ 18 ] . Basically, autophagy responds to three major organismal needs: (1) it preserves cellular homeostasis in physiological conditions; (2) it plays a key role in cellular adaptation to stressful stimuli; and (3) it participates in the communication of states of the danger to the whole organism [ 21 ] . Indeed, autophagy continuously operates to mediate the disposal of potentially dangerous structures that may otherwise accumulate in the cytoplasm as a consequence of normal cellular activities, like old (and damaged) organelles or protein aggregates [ 64 ] . Moreover, the autophagic fl ux is highly responsive to situations in which intracellular or extracellular homeostasis is perturbed, which generally involves either an increased offer of autophagic substrates (as it occurs in the course of viral infection) or an increased need for autophagic functions or products (as it occurs in response to nutrient deprivation) [ 90 ] . In both these settings, profi cient autophagic responses are required for the optimal adaptation of cells to stress, as demonstrated in experiments involving pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy or the depletion of essential components of the autophagic machinery [ 46 ] . Finally, autophagy is required for cells experiencing so-called \"oncogenic stress\" (i.e., the boost of cellular functions driven by activating mutations in one oncogene or loss-of-function mutation in one tumor suppressor gene) to become senescent (a cell-intrinsic oncosuppressive mechanism) while secreting immunostimulatory cytokines and expressing on their surface ligands for activatory natural killer (NK)-cell receptors (hence triggering a cell-extrinsic mechanism of tumor suppression) [ 55 ] . Along similar lines, cancer cells succumbing to a peculiar form of apoptosis known as \"immunogenic cell death\" are able to recruit antigen-presenting cells and hence trigger an adaptive immune response only if they secrete ATP as they die, a process that requires profi cient autophagic responses [ 42 , 45 ] . It should be noted that autophagy has also been causally implicated in some instances of cell death, especially in lower organisms like Drosophila melanogaster [ 13 , 17 ] . However, in mammals autophagy mainly mediates robust cytoprotective functions, and -when cellular homeostasis is irremediably compromised -contributes to the maintenance of organismal homeostasis by playing a role in danger signalling.",

            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) describe clinical syndromes of acute respiratory failure with substantial morbidity and mortality. ALI is characterised by acute infl ammation that causes disruption of the lung endothelial and epithelial barriers. The ALI cellular features include loss of alveolar-capillary membrane integrity, excessive transepithelial neutrophil migration, and release of pro-infl ammatory, cytotoxic mediators. The treatment of ALI is predominantly based on ventilatory strategies [ 35 ] . However, prolonged exposure to high oxygen therapy (hyperoxia) can result in lung injury [ 7 ] . Few studies are present in the literature concerning the role of autophagy in ALI, even so these works support the hypothesis that activation of autophagy has a protective role in this disease. It has been demonstrated that prolonged hyperoxia, which causes characteristic lung injury in mice, induced the increase of LC3II expression. Moreover, in pulmonary epithelial cells, the genetic depletion of LC3 sentitizes the cells to hyperoxia-induced cell death suggesting that LC3 activation confers cytoprotection in oxygen-dependent cytotoxicity [ 93 ] . Besides, the involvement of mitophagy has also been identifi ed. The ability to resist hyperoxia is proportional to PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) expression. In fact, the Pink1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were more susceptible to hyperoxia when compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, genetic deletion of PINK1 or PINK1 silencing in the lung endothelium cells increased susceptibility to hyperoxia via alterations in autophagy/mitophagy, proteasome activation, apoptosis and oxidant generation [ 108 ] .",

            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic infl ammatory lung disease that causes breathing diffi culty, cough, sputum production and dyspnoea. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis can contribute to COPD development. Emphysema is a condition resulting from a severe damage of air sacs (the alveoli). Chronic bronchitis is due to infl ammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes. The lung damage that leads to COPD is caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most often from cigarette smoke (CS), air pollution or workplace exposure to dust, smoke or fumes. However, a genetic susceptibility to the disease should be considered as an important cofactor. Patients with COPD present increased risk of developing other pathologies, such as heart disease or lung cancer [ 53 ] . Multiple molecular mechanisms, not fully understood, participate to the COPD evolution and, among others, the involvement of the autophagic pathway has been pointed out [ 3 , 86 ] . In lung tissue from COPD patients, an increase of autophagic vacuoles as well as several autophagy markers (LC3, ATG4, ATG5/12, ATG7) expression has been detected [ 8 ] . These evidences are perhaps a result of defective autophagic fl ux. To corroborate this hypothesis, an increased accumulation of p62 and ubiquitinated proteins and a decreased expression levels of sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) have been evaluated in lung homogenates from COPD patients [ 92 ] . Kuwano and colleagues hypothesize that the insuffi cient autophagic clearance is involved in the accelerated cell senescence observed in COPD [ 16 , 92 ] . The CS induces mitochondrial damage, accompanied by increased ROS production in vitro . The CS-induced mitophagy was inhibited by PINK1 and PARK2 knockdown, resulting in enhanced mitochondrial ROS production. Moreover, a decreased expression of PARK2 in COPD lungs compared with non-COPD lungs has been detected, suggesting that insuffi cient mitophagy is a part of the pathogenic sequence and cellular senescence of COPD [ 32 ] . In addition, a defective xenophagy has been observed in alveolar macrophages of smokers, suggesting that the deregulation of this selective process may contribute to recurrent infections [ 65 ] . In contrast, other fi ndings indicate that autophagy has an opposite role in COPD favouring the pathological environment. It has been shown that Rtp801 (also known as Redd1) expression is increased in human emphysematous lungs and in lungs of mice exposed to CS, whereas Rtp801 knockout mice were protected against acute CS-induced lung injury. Rtp801 inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), by stabilizing the TSC1-TSC2 inhibitory complex. The inhibition of mTOR is linked to autophagy induction, but Rtp801 expression enhances oxidative stress-dependent cell death, amplifying the development of CS-induced lung injury [ 105 ] . Furthermore, the higher expression of autophagy proteins has been linked to lung epithelial cell death, airway dysfunction and emphysema in response to CS. Genetic depletion of LC3B in vivo ( Map1lc3B \u2212/\u2212 mice) suppressed cell death and emphysematous airspace enlargement during chronic CS exposure compared to the wild type mice [ 9 ] . More recently, the same group demonstrated that mitophagy regulates necroptosis, which contributes to the COPD pathogenesis. Mice defi cient for Pink1 were protected against mitochondrial dysfunction, airspace enlargement and mucociliary clearance (MCC) disruption during CS exposure [ 63 ] . Interestingly, they identifi ed the contribution of a novel selective autophagy-dependent pathway that regulates cilia length, \"ciliophagy\", in the COPD pathophysiological evolution. Exposure to CS reduced cilia length and autophagy-impaired ( Beclin 1 +/\u2212 or Map1lc3B \u2212/\u2212 ) mice resisted to the CS-induced cilia shortening via a mechanism involving histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) [ 48 ] . Accordingly, it has been shown that autophagy negatively regulate ciliogenesis by the degradation of the essential ciliary protein IFT20 [ 70 ] . Conversely, Hedgehog (HH) signalling from primary cilia promotes autophagy [ 70 ] and autophagy promotes ciliogenesis by degrading OFD1 (oral facial digital syndrome) at centriolar satellites [ 95 ] . Further studies are necessary to clarify the dual relationship between these processes [ 101 ] . In conclusion, these studies illustrate that the contribution of autophagy in COPD pathophysiology is complex and show a context-specifi c role depending on the cell type and tissue as well as on the different stimuli involved.",

It directly induces hypersecretion of mucin 5AC, oligomeric mucus/gel forming (MUC5AC) in airway epithelial cell and oxidant stress through a mechanism that is autophagy-dependent, as demonstrated in vitro by depletion of ATG5 or ATG14 in primary human trachealbronchial epithelial cells [ 15 ] .",

Beclin 1 interactome displaces from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) leading to the sequestration of class III-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, accumulation of p62 with consequent inhibition of autophagosomes formation. The resulting accumulation of aggresomes leads to proteasome overload and may promote the accumulation of mutated CFTR in intracellular aggregates [ 54 ] .

HO-1, together with its enzymatic products, is able to inhibit apoptosis and related cell death pathways, conferring tissue protection in case of lung or vascular injury [ 66 ] . HO-1 could represent the link between CF and impaired autophagy since its expression is increased in human bronchial CF cells. This increase has been associated either to the reduction of apoptosis/injury during P. aeruginosa challenge either to the expression of infl ammatory mediators [ 109 ] . Other evidences suggesting the cytoprotective role of HO-1 in CF showed that Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-challenged CF macrophages fail to compartmentalize HO-1 to the cell surface and this mechanism seems to be dependent on the reduction in Caveolin-1 (CAV-1) expression [ 107 ] . In fact, when HO-1 localises at the plasma membrane, is able to form a complex with CAV-1, which in turn binds and detaches MyD88 from its complex with TLR4 thus terminating the cell death signal [ 99 ] .",

AAT is essentially synthetized in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream, where it controls tissue degradation by the enzyme neutrophil elastase. The defi ciency in AAT is associated with liver and lung disease due to the loss of anti-infl ammatory and antiproteolytic functions. The majority of patients with AAT defi ciency are homozygotes for a missense mutation (\"PiZ mutation\": lysine replaces glutamic acid at position 342) that alters protein folding. Mutant AAT molecules polymerize and aggregate in the ER of hepatocytes, forming large intrahepatocytic globules, the characteristic features of this disease. The proteasome is responsible for degrading the soluble form of ATT by means of ER-associated degradation while autophagy is involved in disposal of insoluble ATT polymers and aggregates [ 74 ] . In fact, a signifi cant accumulation of autophagic vacuoles was found in vitro and in vivo in liver cells from AATD patients as well as in PiZ mouse model [ 96 , 97 ] . Whereas in absence of autophagy the degradation of AAT was retarded [ 39 ] . Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the stimulation of autophagy by carbamazepine or rapamycin treatment or by liver-directed gene transfer of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a gene regulating lysosomal function and autophagy [ 89 ] , reduce the hepatic amount of AAT as well as the hepatic fi brosis in mice expressing mutant AAT [ 28 , 41 , 71 ] .

The inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine ameliorates the level of BMPR2, inhibits the proliferation and stimulates apoptosis of rat PASMCs [ 52 ] . A recent publication [ 50 ] confi rms that the inhibition of autophagy, by overexpressing mTOR, is a promising therapeutic strategy against PAH.",

Indeed, besides being required for oncogene-induced senescence and anticancer immunosurveillance (see above) [ 112 ] , autophagy promotes the maintenance of genomic integrity by multiple mechanisms [ 25 ] . First, it mediates the degradation of damaged mitochondria, which are prone to overproduce genotoxic ROS and other redox active entities of endogenous and exogenous origin [ 22 ] . Second, profi cient autophagic responses appear to be required for optimal DNA damage responses [ 59 ] . Third, autophagy is involved in the disposal of potentially oncogenic retrotransposons and micronuclei [ 80 ] . Moreover, autophagy generally mediates anti-infl ammatory effects, and chronic infl ammation is known to accelerate oncogenesis (at least in some tissues, including the lung) [ 14 ] . Finally, it has been proposed that autophagy is required for the preservation of normal tissue architecture, in particular at the level of the stem-cell compartment [ 23 ] . Although little is known on the deregulation of stem cells in pulmonary carcinogenesis, it cannot be excluded that autophagic defects may promote malignant transformation in the lung also via this mechanism [ 69 ] . Conversely, the ability of autophagy to preserve genomic and redox homeostasis seems very relevant in the context of lung tumorigenesis, which in a signifi cant proportion of cases is associated with tobacco smoking or exposure to environmental nanoparticles like asbestos crystals [ 65 ] . Indeed, the oncogenic effects of both smoking and asbestos have been linked to their ability to cause ROS overgeneration along with genetic/genomic defects and chronic infl ammatory responses [ 12 ] . All these effects are limited, at least to some extent, by profi cient autophagic responses.",

This implies that autophagy often (but not always) promotes tumor progression, i.e., the growth and evolution of a transformed cells into an ever more malignant cancer [ 62 ] . Indeed, malignant cells are often exposed to relatively adverse microenvironmental conditions, including a shortage of nutrients and oxygen (especially in poorly vascularized tumor areas), and autophagy is instrumental for these cells (as it is for their non-transformed counterparts) to cope with stress and proliferate. Along similar lines, the ability of autophagy to preserve stemness is benefi cial for the host when it preserves normal tissue architecture, but detrimental when it sustains the malignant stem-cell compartment. Finally, autophagy supports the survival of malignant cells in key step of tumor progression, the so-called \"epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition\" (EMT). In this context, epithelial cancer cells \"initially growing in situ \" physically detach from ECM and become able to colonize surrounding tissues as well as distant organs. The EMT is required for all malignancies to become locally and distantly invasive, and critically relies on profi cient autophagic responses [ 4 ] . In the presence of autophagic defects or pharmacological inhibitors of autophagy, indeed, malignant cells undergoing the EMT and detaching from the ECM, succumb to a form of regulated cell death often referred to as \"anoikis\" [ 73 ] .",

Moreover, concerns have been raised that inhibiting autophagy at the whole-body level may de facto favor malignant transformation in healthy tissues, refl ecting the prominent oncosuppressive functions of autophagy in physiological conditions [ 51 ] . Finally, recent data highlight the differential role of autophagy in cancer therapy in immunocompromised versus immunocompetent hosts [ 44 ] . In this setting, the response to radiotherapy of human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) or murine colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells xenografted in nude mice was significantly improved when cells were rendered autophagy-defi cient by the stable depletion of ATG5 or Beclin 1 [ 44 ] . However, when murine CRC cells were implanted in immunocompetent syngeneic mice, the stable knockdown of ATG5 compromised the therapeutic activity of irradiation, a defect that could be restored (at least in part) by the intratumoral administration of a chemical inhibitor of extracellular ATPases [ 44 ] .

As described in this chapter, lungs are the fi rst line of defence against several insults and associated diseases are growing both in number and chronicisation.
