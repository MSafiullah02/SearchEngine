Rhabdoviruses share some features with members of Filoviridae and Paramyxoviridae (Mononegavirales). Common features of rhabdoviruses are bacilliform (plant rhabdoviruses) or bullet-shaped (vertebrate rhabdoviruses) morphology. The enveloped virions measure 100\u00b1430\u00b445\u00b1 100 nm.

The viruses are mostly associated with epizootics and heavy losses in piscine aquaculture. The transmission (Fig. 7, p. 430 ) of \u00aesh pathogenic rhabdoviruses occurs mainly by shedding from infected \u00aesh, and the viruses are spread by waterborne contact (Wolf, 1988) . The early targets for the viruses are gills, the oesophagus\u00b1cardiac stomach region, and mucus-secreting glands (Fig. 5, p. 416) . As shown for VHSV, the primary receptor for \u00aesh rhabdoviruses was found to be a cell surface complex where \u00aebronectin acts as an initial cell molecule target . DNA vaccines encoding the G-protein of several \u00aesh pathogenic rhabdoviruses induce an early interferon-mediated non-speci\u00aec protection followed by a speci\u00aec immune response . Several rhabdoviruses have been isolated from a variety of freshwater and marine \u00aesh species worldwide, but only some of the agents have been studied in detail. Many of the piscine rhabdoviruses may represent strains or variants of piscine novirhabdovirus or vesiculovirus species. The novirhabdoviruses can be distinguished from the piscine vesiculoviruses (Table 2 ) by a non-structural protein (12\u00b114 kDa, 111 amino acids), the nonvirion protein (NV-protein) (Kurath et al., 1997) . The NV protein plays an important role in the viral replication . New \u00aendings suggest that the IHNV NV protein is not absolutely required for viral replication, but its presence greatly improves viral multiplication (Biacchesi et al., 2000a 13 ). The presence of the highly conserved NV genes, located between the G-and L-genes, proved to be unique to the members of the new established genus Novirhabdovirus of Rhabdoviridae (Walker et al., 2000) . An RNase protection assay revealed NV gene sequence variations between IHN virus strains . Recently it was shown that synthetic cDNA minigenomes of the two salmonid novirhabdoviruses IHNV and VHSV could successfully be recovered following heterologous virus infection as these were replicated, encapsulated and transcribed (Biacchesi et al., 2000b 14 ).

Acutely infected \u00aesh release the virus by faeces, urine and external mucus. Carriers shed the agent via sexual products. Truncated IHNV particles, detected in persistently infected rainbow trout, proved to be mediators of persistence of the virus (Kim et al., 1999) . IHNV, the type species of the genus Novirhabdovirus, was enzootic in North America for decades, but the agent has been spread to the Far East and continental Europe. IHNV epizootics occur usually in young Salmoniformes, but Acipenseriformes, Pleuronectiformes and Perciformes are also susceptible to the virus (Winton, 1992) .

Four distinct monophyletic clades were observed during phylogenetic analysis of 84 IHNV isolates (Troyer et al., 2000) . IHNV observed in Europe and IHNV strains in North America represent two different genotypes (Arkush et al., 1989) . Diagnosis of IHNV is based on direct methods, e.g. isolation (EPC-cells) and identi\u00aecation (NT, IFAT, ELISA, PCR and DNA probes) of virus or the demonstration of IHNV antigen in infected tissue. Detection of IHNV antibodies is not accepted for assessing the viral status of \u00aesh populations (OIE, 2001) . Biotinylated oligonucleotide probes are successfully used for identi\u00aecation of IHNV (Deering et al., 1991) . At least two functions for the M-protein in an IHNV infection were suggested: the down-regulation of host transcription and the induction of programmed cell death (Chiou et al., 2000) . IHN is listed as an OIE noti\u00aeable disease. Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) is the aetiological agent of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS), a well-known important viral disease in European rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) aquaculture (Wolf, 1988) . VHSV shows the typical morphology and characteristics of Rhabdoviridae. This rhabdovirus is responsible for high mortality rates (90\u00b1100%) occurring usually among juvenile \u00aesh in trout aquaculture at 4\u00b114\u00b0C. The virus possesses a wide host spectrum infecting several freshwater and marine \u00aeshes (Anguilliformes, Clupeiformes, Cypriniformes, Gadiformes, Perciformes, Pleuronectiformes and Salmoniformes). Multiplication of the virus takes place in endothelial cells of blood capillaries (leading to haemorrhagic lesions in internal organs and musculature), leucocytes, haematopoietic tissues and nephron cells. Infected \u00aesh are lethargic or hyperactive. They may show exophthalmia and bleeding in the skin and \u00aen bases (Fig. 4) . Infection of \u00aesh is mostly lethal due to impairment of osmotic balance. Clinically infected \u00aesh and VHSV carriers are reservoirs of the virus, which is shed by faeces, urine and sexual\u00afuids. VHSV induces interferon in the early stage of infection (de Kinkelin and Dorson, 1973) . Survivors are resistant to reinfection due to the development of neutralizing antibodies (Jorgensen, 1971) . The transmembrane viral G-protein functions as target molecule for neutralizing antibodies (Lorenzen et al., 1990) . The rainbow trout gene vig-1 (gene number 1 expressed in spleen and head kidney) is activated during VHSV infection and leads to inactivation of the virus. The vig-1 gene may be induced by interferon or directly by the viral G-protein (Boudinot et al., 1999) . VHSV occurred exclusively in Europe for decades, but in 1988 VHSV was detected in salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, O. kisutch) native to the Paci\u00aec Northwest returning to hatcheries in Washington located near the open ocean. Molecular analysis proved that North American VHSV strains were not of European origin (Meyers and Winton, 1995) . The North American VHSV strain is enzootic in the north-eastern Paci\u00aec Ocean among herring and cod. The virus shows high pathogenicity for Paci\u00aec herring (Clupea harengus pallasi) (Kocan et al., 1997) . In 1998 thousands of dead Paci\u00aec herring, Paci\u00aec hake (Merluccius productus) and walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) were found in Alaska, having been infected by the American strain of VHS (Meyers et al., 1999) . VHSV was isolated from several marine \u00aeshes (Clupea harengus, Sprattus sprattus, Gadus morhua, Rhinonemus cimbrius, Trisopterus esmarkii, Micromesistius poutassou, Merlangius merlangus, Argentina sphyraena) in the Baltic Sea, Kattegat, Skagerrak and North Sea (Mortensen et al., 1999 ).

The geographical range of SVC is limited to aquatic environments where temperatures decline during the winter. The outbreaks usually occur in springtime, when water temperature rises (11\u00b117\u00b0C). The SVCV is shed via faeces, urine and sexual\u00afuids, and is transmitted by contact and by animate vectors (Argulus foliaceus, Piscicola geometra) (Fig. 7 , p. 430) (Ahne, 1985a) . After \u00aesh have taken up the virus, it is disseminated within a few days in the body of infected carp (Fig. 5 , p. 416) (Ahne, 1978a) . Multiplication of the virus takes place in endothelial cells of blood capillaries, haematopoietic tissue and nephron cells. Clinical signs of SVCV are external and internal haemorrhages, peritonitis and ascites (Fijan, 1972) . An SVCV infection can be lethal because of impairment of the salt-water balance. The virus has a wide host spectrum, infecting mainly Cypriniformes but also Atheriformes, Salmoniformes and Crustacea (Fijan, 1972; Wolf, 1988; Johnson et al., 1999; Stone et al., 2001) .

An investigation of the DNA polymerase from necropsies of tumour-bearing pike has revealed an optimum temperature pro\u00aele of 20\u00b0C (Papas et al., 1977) . The pike lymphosarcoma virus is supposed to induce one of the most frequently found neoplasms (21% frequency) in wild vertebrates, and is epizootic in North America, Sweden and Finland (Papas et al., 1976) . Several retrovirus-like particles associated with proliferative conditions in \u00aesh have been reported (Bowser and Casey, 1993) . Epidermal papilloma of white sucker (Catostomus commersoni) have carried C-type particles (100 nm in diameter) associated with transcriptase activity. C-type particles of about 110\u00b1150 nm have been found in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) with swimbladder neoplasia and epidermal papilloma. Walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) has for many years shown high incidence (27%) of sarcomatous lesions associated with retroviruses in North America (walleye dermal sarcoma virus, WDSV). The virus does not integrate and tumours do not metastasize (Martineau et al., 1991) . Retrovirus particles with RT activity have been found in homogenates of the walleye dermal sarcoma. Isolated viral RNA (12 kb) hybridized with a 13-kb viral DNA present in DNA of walleye tumours. Lairmore et al. (2000) reported that the D-cyclin homologue (retroviral (rv) cyclin) is encoded by WDSV and the cyclin mRNA is present in developing tumours. The rv-cyclin seems to plays an important role in the development of walleye dermal sarcoma. Furthermore, a plasmacytoid leukaemia (PL) of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) has been suggested to be of oncovirus origin. Evidence of the retrovirus aetiology of plasmacytoid leukaemia comes from reverse transcriptase activity in affected tissue, visualization of retrovirus-like particles by electron microscopy, or transmission of the disease. Skin tumours of hooknose (Agonus cataphractus) have contained lentivirus-like particles of 86\u00b1132 nm. C-type particles have been observed in epidermal papillomatosis of European smelt (Osmerus eperlanus). A dual infection of bluegills (Lepomis macrochirus) with retrovirus and lymphocystis virus has been reported. Cell cultures derived from three species of warm-water \u00aeshes (Ophicephalus striatus, Anabas testudineus, Trichogaster pectoralis) and from neoplastic embryonic tissues of the platy\u00aesh (Xiphophorus maculatus) have released spontaneously C-type retroviruses associated with transcriptase activity (Frerichs et al., 1991; Petry et al., 1992) . The complete nucleotide sequence of the snakehead retrovirus (SnRV), exhibiting persistent infection of the striped snakehead (Ophicephalus striatus) cell line (SSN-1), has been analysed (Hart et al., 1996) . The proteins (p70, p65 and p28) of the retrovirus from platy\u00aesh cell culture react with antiserum directed against the p27 protein of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), and RT activity is inhibited by antibodies against the RT of FeLV. In addition, hybridization experiments have revealed sequence homology between FeLV and the genome of platy\u00aesh (Petry et al., 1992) . Retrovirus-like particles with RT activity and a RNA of 7.3 kb have been isolated from coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), masou salmon (O. masou), rainbow trout (O. mykiss), iwana (Salvelinus pluvius) and ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) (Oh et al., 1995) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 148, "end": 166, "text": "(Sonstegard, 1976)", "ref_id": "BIBREF386"}, {"start": 545, "end": 565, "text": "(Papas et al., 1977)", "ref_id": "BIBREF332"}, {"start": 753, "end": 773, "text": "(Papas et al., 1976)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 877, "end": 901, "text": "(Bowser and Casey, 1993)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1437, "end": 1461, "text": "(Martineau et al., 1991)", "ref_id": "BIBREF278"}, {"start": 1660, "end": 1682, "text": "Lairmore et al.

Since that time, similar disease cases (`viral encephalopathy and retinopathy', VER;`\u00aesh encephalitis',`encephalomyelitis',`striped jack viral nervous necrosis') occurring with high mortalities among larvae and juveniles of several species out of 10 families of marine \u00aesh have been described in the Indo-Paci\u00aec region, the Mediterranean, France and Scandinavia. The causative agents have been previously described as picornaviruslike. Piscine nodaviruses have a tropism for nerve cells and during NNV-infection they are spread from the spinal cord to the brain and retina. There are differences regarding the occurrence (age, species) and severity of the disease (OIE, 2001) . A 423 Viruses of Lower Vertebrates vertical transmission of \u00aesh nodaviruses has been shown (Munday and Nakai, 1997) . The striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV) isolated from larvae of striped jack (Pseudocaranx dentex) (Mori et al., 1992) is characterized and classi\u00aeed as type species of the genus Betanodavirus of Nodaviridae (van Regenmortel et al., 2000) . The nonenveloped virus particles, measuring 25 nm, contain two molecules of ssRNA with positive-sense orientation. The RNA does not have poly(A) sequences at the 3\u00a2 end. Virions consist of a 40-kDa and a 42-kDa protein. The complete RNA2 of SJVNN and that of an isolate from Dicentrarchus labrax with encephalitis have been sequenced (Nishizawa et al., 1995; Delsert et al., 1997) . Based on sequence data of the SJNNV-RNA2 a portion of the protein gene could be ampli\u00aeed by PCR (Nishizawa et al., 1994) . A RT-PCR has been used to detect the presence of piscine nodavirus in a wide range of \u00aesh species (Nishizawa et al., 1997b; Thiery et al., 1997) . A sequence part of the RNA2 of Atlantic halibut nodavirus (AH95NorA) shows 80% identity to that of SJNNV and comprises features common to all nodaviruses. The RNA2 of isolates from Europe (European sea bass from the Mediterranean) and Japan (redspotted grouper) shows sequence identity of 99.5% (Sideris, 1997) . The T2 region of the RNA2 of AH95NorA shares 98% of the nucleotide sequence of bar\u00aen\u00afounder nervous necrosis virus, while the nucleotide sequence identity to SJNNV is 76%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of the variable region (T4) of the viral capsid protein gene region of \u00aesh nodaviruses reveals a close relationship (Grotmol et al., 2000) . Comparison of T4 of 20 piscine nodaviruses shows four major clades, e.g. the striped jack clade, the redspotted grouper clade, the tiger puffer clade and the bar\u00aen\u00afounder clade. Interestingly, AH95NorA is grouped in the bar\u00aen ounder clade together with strains isolated from Paci\u00aec \u00aesh, suggesting a transmission of the viruses from the Paci\u00aec to the Atlantic Ocean or vice versa (Nishizawa et al., 1997b; Grotmol et al., 2000) . However, piscine nodavirus strains of European sea bass from the Atlantic coast of France could not be assigned to any of the four clades (Thiery et al., 1997) . Comparison of features of the RNAs, capsid protein processing and the low similarity (e.g. coat protein, 10% amino acid similarity) suggest that piscine nodaviruses are distinct from insect nodaviruses Munday and Nakai, 1997 24 ). At present, hosts recognized are several species out of 10 families of \u00aeshes. Piscine nodavirus species of the genus Betanodavirus are the type species striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV), bar\u00aen\u00afounder nervous necrosis virus (BFNNV), Dicentrarchus labrax encephalitis virus (DIEV), Japanes\u0113 ounder nervous necrosis virus (JFNNV), Lates calcarifer encephalitis virus (LcEV), redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV), and tiger puffer nervous necrosis virus (TPNNV). Tentative species in the genus are the Atlantic halibut nodavirus (AHNV) and the Malabar grouper nervous necrosis virus (MGNNV) (van Regenmortel et al., 2000) . Viral encephalopathy and retinopathy or viral nervous necrosis is an OIE signi\u00aecant disease. Piscine nodaviruses can be propagated ef\u00aeciently in vitro exclusively in the SSN-1 cell line originating from tissue of striped snakehead (Ophicephalus striatus) Iwamoto et al., 1999) . However, the disadvantage of the use of SSN-1 cells is that the cell line is persistently infected with the snakehead retrovirus (SnRV) (Frerichs et al., 1991) . Optimal growth temperatures differ among the four genotypic variants, e.g. 25\u00b130\u00b0C for the RGNNV genotype, 25\u00b130\u00b0C for the SJNNV genotype, 20\u00b0C for the TPNNV genotype, and 15\u00b0C for the BFNNV genotype. Diagnostic procedures recommended are at present electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry,\u00afuorescent antibody techniques, ELISA and PCR (OIE, 2001) . 424 ESSBAUER and AHNE", "cite_spans": [{"start": 214, "end": 242, "text": "(Yoshikoshi and Inouye, 1990", "ref_id": "BIBREF439"}, {"start": 910, "end": 921, "text": "(OIE, 2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1039, "text": "(Munday and Nakai, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF305"}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1168, "text": "(Mori et al., 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF298"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1288, "text": "(van Regenmortel et al., 2000)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1649, "text": "(Nishizawa et al., 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF319"}, {"start": 1650, "end": 1671, "text": "Delsert et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF109"}, {"start": 1770, "end": 1794, "text": "(Nishizawa et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF318"}, {"start": 1895, "end": 1920, "text": "(Nishizawa et al., 1997b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF321"}, {"start": 1921, "end": 1941, "text": "Thiery et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF403"}, {"start": 2239, "end": 2254, "text": "(Sideris, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF380"}, {"start": 2601, "end": 2623, "text": "(Grotmol et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 3006, "end": 3031, "text": "(Nishizawa et al., 1997b;", "ref_id": "BIBREF321"}, {"start": 3032, "end": 3053, "text": "Grotmol et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 3194, "end": 3215, "text": "(Thiery et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF403"}, {"start": 3420, "end": 3445, "text": "Munday and Nakai, 1997 24", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4059, "end": 4089, "text": "(van Regenmortel et al., 2000)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4347, "end": 4368, "text": "Iwamoto et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF192"}, {"start": 4507, "end": 4530, "text": "(Frerichs et al., 1991)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4871, "end": 4882, "text": "(OIE, 2001)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4885, "end": 4888, "text": "424", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "NODAVIRIDAE"}, {"text": "The family Reoviridae contains the genera Aquareovirus, Coltivirus, Cypovirus, Fijivirus, Orbivirus, Orthoreovirus, Oryzavirus, Phytoreovirus and Rotavirus.

The genome consists of 10, 11 or 12 segments of dsRNA. Several polypeptides form one or two outer coats as well as an inner coat. There are at least three internal structural proteins acting as RNA polymerase and an associated enzyme involved in mRNA synthesis. Reoviruses occurring in aquatic animals are grouped in the genus Aquareovirus. Aquareoviruses have a wide host spectrum infecting \u00aen\u00aesh, shell\u00aesh and crustacea. Common features of the aquareoviruses are the double capsid shell, 11 dsRNAs and seven structural proteins (VP1\u00b1VP7). Virions, measuring about 80 nm in diameter, have type-and group-speci\u00aec antigenic determinants located in the outer capsid protein. Aquareoviruses replicate in \u00aesh and mammalian cell lines, inducing syncytia formation at 15\u00b125\u00b0C (Winton et al., 1987; Lupiani et al., 1995; van Regenmortel et al., 2000) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1087, "end": 1108, "text": "(Winton et al., 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF430"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1130, "text": "Lupiani et al., 1995;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1131, "end": 1160, "text": "van Regenmortel et al., 2000)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "REOVIRIDAE"}, {"text": "The \u00aerst \u00aen\u00aesh reovirus (golden shiner virus, GSRV) was isolated from golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas) in the USA (Plumb et al., 1979) . Later, several reovirus-like agents were found to be present in a variety of aquatic animals (\u00aen\u00aesh, shell\u00aesh and crustaceans). The aquatic reoviruses did not \u00aet within any of the established genera of Reoviridae. Apart from the 11 segments of dsRNA of which species of the genus Rotavirus are composed, aquatic reoviruses differ from other reoviruses in terms of host range, optimal growth temperature, serology, RNA pro\u00aeles and polypeptide pro\u00aele (Winton et al., 1987) . Consequently, reoviruses of aquatic animals were grouped in the genus Aquareovirus of Reoviridae (van Regenmortel et al., 2000) . Aquareoviruses measure about 80 nm; their viral density in caesium chloride is 1.36 g/cm 3 . Virions contain seven structural proteins (VP1: 130 kDa; VP2: 127 kDa; VP3: 126 kDa; VP4: 73 kDa; VP5: 71 kDa; VP6: 46 kDa; and VP7: 35 kDa) and \u00aeve non-structural proteins (NS97: 97 kDa; NS39: 39 kDa; NS29: 29 kDa; NS28: 28 kDa; and NS15: 15 kDa). The inner capsid is encoded by segments 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8, the major outer capsid by segment 10, and the non-structural proteins by segments 4, 7, 9 and 11. Segments 1\u00b110 encode one protein, while segment 11 encodes two proteins, the non-structural proteins NS29 and NS15. Comparison of these two non-structural proteins by partial protease digestion indicated that NS15 is a truncated form of NS29, being initiated at a downstream initiation codon (Subramanian et al., 25 1994) . Nucleotide sequence analysis of segment 11 of the genome of striped bass reovirus (SBRV) revealed a 780-nucleotide open reading frame (ORF) coding for 236 amino acids and a 480-nucleotide ORF coding for 145 amino acids. The genome segment 11 contains 24 non-translated nucleotides at the 5\u00a2 end and 48 at the 3\u00a2 end. The gene codes for NS29 and NS15 showed no sequence relatedness to gene sequences of the other members of Reoviridae . On the basis of RNA\u00b1RNA hybridization, several genotypes of aquareoviruses among more than 40 strains have been recognized (Rangel et al., 1999) . The genus Aquareovirus includes at present 26 reoviruses of \u00aesh and two of shell\u00aesh. The species in the genus are divided into six genotypes (Aquareovirus A\u00b1F) (Table 4 ). Genogroup A is the most heterogeneous, consisting of members of cold-and warm-water \u00aeshes of several continents. Only group A and B show serologic cross-reactivity. RNA\u00b1RNA hybridization between genogroups A and B revealed segment 10 (encoding the major outer capsid protein) to be the most variable gene (Lupiani et al., 1995) . The VP7, the glycosylated outer capsid protein, being responsible for virulence, stability and neutralization of the reoviruses is different between 425 Viruses of Lower Vertebrates the genotypes as determined via Western blots (Lupiani et al., 1997; McPhillips et al., 1998) . Three-dimensional cryomicroscopy showed that trypsin treatment removes VP7 completely and induces conformational changes in the VP5 trimer (Nason et al., 2000) . The viruses replicate in several \u00aesh and mammalian cells at 15\u00b125\u00b0C forming syncytia and lysis of infected cells (Winton et al., 1987; Samal et al., 1998) . The infectivity of the viruses can be increased by treatment with proteases (McPhillips et al., 1998 27 ). Several reoviruses have been isolated during surveillance of cultured and feral \u00aesh worldwide. Most of the isolates are non-pathogenic or of low pathogenicity in their host species (Hetrick et al., 1992) . However, the grass carp reovirus (GCRV), infecting cyprinids in China seems to be highly pathogenic in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) (Chen and Jiang, 1984) .

In cross-neutralization tests some serotype-like differences between snake reoviruses can be observed, but no serological reaction with the mammalian reovirus type 3 occurred. However, one-way reaction between antisera against the reptilian and avian reoviruses has been observed. Electrophoretic analysis showed minor differences between the migration patterns of the 10 dsRNAs of the reptilian reoviruses, but they resembled the pattern of chicken reovirus . Elaphe reovirus isolated from juvenile Moellendorff's ratsnakes (Elaphe moellendorf\u00ae) and beauty snakes (Elaphe taenuris) produced large syncytia formation in VH2 cells at 30\u00b0C.

The agent was obtained during an epizootic of rainbow trout \u00aengerlings suffering from infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN). This infectious pancreatis necrosis virus (IPNV) was deposited in the ATCC as ATCC VR299 32 . IPNV had been detected for years in several places in North America associated with high mortality rates of trout fry at water temperatures of 8\u00b112\u00b0C. In the following years, IPNV strains were recognized in many countries around the world among individuals of more than 20 families of teleost \u00aesh. The agent is probably present in all major troutfarming countries. Recently, an IPNV closely related to IPNV fr21 and N1 33,34 33,34 was \u00aerst detected in Australia 33,34 33,34 (Crane et al., 2000) . IPNV is transmitted by faeces, urine and sexual products of infected \u00aesh and it is easily spread by shipment of contaminated \u00aesh eggs from one country to another. Studies on factors affecting the transmission and outbreaks of IPN indicated that iodophores used as a disinfectant during the arti\u00aecial eggfertilization process did not completely eradicate IPN infectivity . Survivors of an IPNV outbreak become IPNV carriers and can shed the virus for the whole lifetime (Hill, 1982; Wolf, 1988) . IPNV can be transmitted by faeces of piscivorous birds, e.g. heron, crow, grackle, king\u00aesher, sparrows, mallards, egrets and ospreys (McAllister and Owens, 1992) . The majority of aquatic birnaviruses are antigenically related, representing one large serogroup (A) with 10 serotypes. Only a few antigenically unrelated aquatic birnaviruses form a second, minor serogroup (B) ( Table 5 ). Most IPNV (Hill and Way, 1995) . The aquatic birnaviruses share similarities in morphology and biochemical/ biophysical properties. The non-enveloped, single-shelled IPNV virions have an icosahedral morphology and measure 60 nm in diameter. They possess a bisegmented dsRNA genome. The larger genome segment A (3 kb) contains an ORF encoding a 100-kDa protein that is subsequently cleaved to pVP2 (63 kDa), NS (29 kDa) and VP3 (29\u00b131 kDa) proteins by the protease activity associated with the VP4 (NS) protein.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 192, "end": 211, "text": "(Wolf et al., 1959)", "ref_id": "BIBREF435"}, {"start": 906, "end": 926, "text": "(Crane et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 1398, "end": 1410, "text": "(Hill, 1982;", "ref_id": "BIBREF177"}, {"start": 1411, "end": 1422, "text": "Wolf, 1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF433"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1586, "text": "(McAllister and Owens, 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF282"}, {"start": 1823, "end": 1843, "text": "(Hill and Way, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF178"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1802, "end": 1809, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": "TABREF6"}], "section": "Birnaviruses occurring in \u00aesh"}, {"text": "The VP4 protease is a unusual type of serine protease sharing properties with prokaryotic leader peptidases and other bacterial proteases, and cannot cleave heterologous substrates (e.g. infectious bursal disease virus, IBDV, proteins) or vice versa Petit et al., 2000) . The A segment contains a small ORF partly overlapping the 5\u00a2 end of the ORF encoding VP5 (17 kDa) (Heppell et al., 1995a) . The smaller genome segment B encodes the transcriptase (VP1, 90\u00b1110 kDa), with 41% homology to the IBDV VP1. It is present as free and genome-linked (5\u00a2 terminus) protein VP1 in the virion. The virion VP1 primes viral RNA synthesis in vitro, a VP1\u00b1 pN structure acts as a primer for viral RNA synthesis (Magyar et al., 1998) . The pVP2 protein is processed to the major capsid protein VP2 (50\u00b155 kDa) (Duncan and Dobos, 1986; Harvarstein et al., 1990; Manning and Leong, 1990) . Investigation of the subcellular localization of IPNV structural proteins suggests that VP2 is glycosylated freely in the cytoplasm of infected cells (Espinoza et al., 2000) . The central variable domain and 20 adjacent amino acids of the conserved C-terminal part of the major immunogenic polypeptide VP2 induce the 35 animal's protective immunogenic response (Heppell et al., 1995b) . A reverse genetic system for IPNV was established by Yao and Vakharia (1998 36 ) using plus-stranded RNA transcripts derived from cloned cDNA. Quasispecies heterogeneity and rapid mutation characteristics of IPNV have been studied with RNA \u00aengerprinting. It has been found that three clusters exist and that the IPNV Sp represents a different evolutionary route from those of the IPNV Ab and the VR299 clusters. Molecular relationship could be correlated with biological characteristics (e.g. cell line, adaptive replication at high temperature) (Hsu et al., 1995) . Phylogenetic comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the VP2 coding region of 28 aquatic birnaviruses, including the type strains of the serogroup A, reveals six genogroups with several genotypes. The most divergent viruses exhibit a similarity of 81.2%. The genogroups based on the entire VP2\u00b1ORF generally correlate with geographical origin and serological classi\u00aecation ( 37 B. L. Nicholson, personal communication). Investigations of the VP2 gene by PCR and RFLP cluster analysis grouped 17 Asian isolates (all serotype A3) in four major genogroups. The groups based on the variation of the VP2 gene correlated with the serological classi\u00aecation based on VP2-speci\u00aec monoclonal antibody reaction pattern (Lee et al., 1996) . However, characterization of the small ORF on the genome segment A of 20 IPNV strains reveals three major genotypes. According to correlation between serological and genomic classi\u00aecation, some of the 10 serotypes of serogroup A seem in fact to be subtypes. Serotype A4 (IPNV isolated from pike (Hecht) in Germany) (Ahne, 1978b) appears different from all serotypes of Serogroup A (Heppell et al., 1995b) .

FV-3 is pathogenic for tailbuds, hatching stage embryos and tadpoles of frogs and Fowler's toads (Bufo woodhousei fowleri). The virus causes severe oedema, dermal haemorrhages and high mortalities. FV-3 replicates in mammalian, reptilian and \u00aesh cell lines, and in primary chicken embryo cells (Essani and Granoff, 1989 ) between 12 and 30\u00b0C. Virions measure 130\u00b1160 nm in diameter, and contain 29 structural and 61 non-structural proteins (Elliott and Kelly, 1980) . The core consists of 10\u00b115 phosphoproteins (M r 10\u00b1114\u00b410 3 ). The dsDNA genome is highly methylated at CpG sequences by a virus-encoded methyl-transferase. It is circularly permuted and terminally redundant (Goorha and Murti, 1982; Essani and Granoff, 1989) . The methylation of DNA takes place in the cytoplasm and is required for the production of genomic-size DNA during FV-3 replication. The FV-3 DNA methyl-transferase has been identi\u00aeed and analysed (Kaur et al., 1995) . The viral life cycle is characterized by two-stage DNA synthesis cycles (Fig. 10, p. 435) . 44 In the \u00aerst stage, less than the full genome of viral DNA is synthesized in the nucleus. In the second stage, the DNA is replicated in the cytoplasm as concatemers, in a similar way to bacteriophage genomes. Finally, the concatemers are cleaved to produce mature viral DNA Granoff, 1989) . The virions assemble in the cytoplasm and are released by budding . An ATPase is associated with viral particles and possibly integrated in virions (Aubertin et al., 1971) . Virion proteins contain a peptide rapidly inhibiting cellular macromolecular synthesis (Willis and Granoff, 1976) . Cellular RNA and DNA synthesis are shut down upon infection. Three temporal classes of mRNAs without poly-A tails have been identi\u00aeed as undergoing no post-transcriptional cleavage. RNA synthesis is a sequentially controlled process starting in the nucleus of the infected cells requiring modi\u00aeed cellular RNA polymerase II (Goorha, 1981) . Protein translation is determined by the availability of transcripts. Virus proteins are regulated at the transcriptional and post-433 Viruses of Lower Vertebrates transcriptional level (Willis et al., 1985) . FV-3 seems to have evolved unique signals for the inhibition and termination of transcription as it has no regulatory sequences resembling those of other eukaryotic genes. Highly methylated promoters that are normally refractory 45 to transcription are used from the host polymerase. A few ORFs of FV-3 have been sequenced and their regulating regions studied (Thompson et al., 1986; Munnes et al., 1995) . FV-3 induces changes in the cellular cytoskeleton. Microtubules are reduced and intermediate \u00aelaments are reorganized around virus assembly sites and anchor the virus particles beneath the nucleus. Late in infection many`microvillus-like' projections containing micro\u00aelaments and virus particles appear on the cell surface, suggesting a role for these cytoskeleton elements in virus release. FV-3 inhibits selectively tubulin synthesis, phosphorylates vimentin and modi\u00aees actin. The changes are relevant to FV-3 replication as heat-inactivated or mutants of FV-3 do not induce these alterations (Murti and Goorha, 1990) . Parenteral inoculation of mice or rats with FV-3, inactivated FV-3 or its solubilized proteins induces an acute degenerative hepatitis leading to death in less than 24 h. The pathogenic mechanism seems to be a toxic one because FV-3 does not multiply at temperatures above 30\u00b0C (Kirn et al., 1989) . Frog virus 1 (FV-1), frog virus 2 (FV-2), and Lucke \u00c2 tumour-associated viruses (LT, T) are antigenically related and probably represent various strains of FV-3. All of these viruses induce oedema and mortalities in tadpoles of toads and frogs. The tadpole oedema virus (TEV; ATCC VR-678) causes oedema and death in adult anurans such as bullfrogs and toads (Scaphiosus hammondii americanus, Bufo americanus, B. woodhousii fowleri) (Granoff, 1989) .

The highly pathogenic viruses EHNV, ESV and ECV cause systemic infections leading to severe haematopoietic necrosis (EHN) in \u00aesh. Viruses of the EHN group replicate in several \u00aesh cell lines at 15\u00b128\u00b0C, inducing cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and lysis of infected cells. The viruses are released from infected cells by budding. EHN is noti\u00aeable to the OIE.

The viruses share similarities in morphology and size (160 10 nm in diameter), they cross-react in IFAT, but the viruses can be distinguished by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting and RE fragment patterns. More than 20 polypeptides can be recognized by SDS-PAGE. The MCP of EHNV is slightly larger (51 kDa) compared with that of ESV and ECV (49 kDa). The polypeptides of 120, 55, 40 and 21 kDa of the piscine and amphibian iridoviruses associated with systemic diseases cross-react to a high degree with homologous and heterologous antisera in Western blot. Electrophoresis patterns of the restriction enzyme fragments are similar in the case of the European piscine iridoviruses (ESV, ECV), but they are different from EHNV (Ahne et al., 1998b) .

Juvenile largemouth bass and striped bass (Morone saxatilis) are susceptible to LMBV. To determine the prevalence of LMBV, wild largemouth bass were investigated during 1997\u00b11998 in south-eastern USA. LMBV was detected by isolation in dead or healthy \u00aesh in seven natural reservoirs. The only pathological sign seen was an enlarged, in\u00afamed swimbladder in infected \u00aesh. In the summer of 2000 recent outbreaks of LMBV in \u00aeve Texan reservoirs and on lakes in four other southern US states have been reported.

DFV and GV-6 DNA do not hybridize with FV-3 DNA.

The internal nucleid surrounds a circular to bar-shaped electron-dense core and has a diameter of 208 nm (Hedrick et al., 1990a; Adkison et al., 1998) . The virus is potentially enzootic in wild white sturgeon populations throughout the Paci\u00aec Northwest of North America. The disease caused by WSIV is most severe in juvenile sturgeon younger than one year old (LaPatra et al., 1996) . WSIV is an epitheliotropic virus infecting the skin, gills and the upper alimentary tract, inducing mortality (Hedrick et al., 1990a) . Parts of the integument and skin are hypertrophied, with enlarged Malpighian cells, usually full of virus particles. The WSIV has been isolated in sturgeon cell lines. In contrast to other \u00aesh iridoviruses, WSIV is suspected to be horizontally and vertically transmitted from broodstock. Antigenic relationship of WSIV to the EHN-like virus group or RSIV is low. WSIV is epitheliotropic, morphologically different from other iridoviruses, and it can also be distinguished by host-cell susceptibility, type of CPE, and the location of the target host cells. An iridovirus similar to WSIV has been identi\u00aeed in Russian sturgeon (Acipenser guldenstadi) in Northern Europe, where it may be enzootic among cultured populations of several species of sturgeon.

The virus has been cultivated in different \u00aesh cell lines at 25\u00b0C, reaching titres of 10 7,5 PFU/ml. Virions, measuring 175\u00b1200 nm in diameter, are sensitive to lipid solvents and heat treatment (1 h, 60\u00b0C) and UV (20\u00b140 min). The viral replication is inhibited by acyclovir and IUdR (Plumb, 1989) . The virus has a buoyant density of 1.29 g/cm 3 caesium chloride. Thirty-two polypeptides are encoded in the virus genome, of which are 18 structural proteins. The IcHV-1 genome is 134.2 kbp long and has 77 ORFs; 14 of these are in direct repeated regions (DR, each 18.5 kbp)\u00afanking a 97.1 kbp unique long (UL) region. The IcHV-1 seems to be unrelated to mammalian herpesviruses (Davison, 1992; Kucuktas and Brady, 1999; Pringle, 1999) . According to genetic comparisons and the low similarity to other herpesviruses a separate evolutionary origin for IcHV-1 must be considered (Davison, 1992; Davison and Davison, 1995) . IcHV-1 gene expression in the direct repeat region is temporally regulated: immediate-early transcripts encoding viral transactivators are of ORFs 1 and 3, early RNAs are encoded by ORFs 2\u00b19 and 11\u00b114, immediate to late RNAs by ORFs 4, 7 and 10\u00b113. For several transcripts (e.g. of ORFs 5 and 6) bicistronic transcripts are reported (Stingley and Gray, 2000) . ORF 59 of IcHV-1 encodes an abundant hydrophobic membrane glycoprotein, the major envelope glycoprotein of the virus (Kucuktas et al., 1998) . ORF 50 encodes a secreted, mucin-like glycoprotein (gp250) revealing different size in several isolates of IcHV-1. This is a characteristic of mucin genes caused by crossing-over events between the internal repeat sequences (Vanderheijden et al., 1999) . IcHV-1 thymidine kinase (TK, 444 ESSBAUER and AHNE encoded by ORF 5 in DR) is highly divergent and biochemically distinguishable from TKs of host cells or other herpesviruses, as it is inhibited by deoxypurines and shows less dTTP-mediated feedback inhibition. The thymidine kinase of IcHV-1 has the unique property to use CTP as a donor of phosphate and is related to human deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) (Harrison et al., 1991; Hanson and Thune, 1993) . Experimental infection of channel cat\u00aesh \u00aengerlings with IcHV-1 leads to a haemorrhagic, oedematous and anaemic disease and mortality (Plumb, 1989) . Fish produce neutralizing antibodies against IcHV-1 maintaining for 2 years . Different genetic strains of channel cat\u00aesh vary in susceptibility to IcHV-1, and hybrids especially have proved to be less susceptible (Plumb, 1989) . IcHV-1 virulence is reduced at temperatures below 20\u00b0C (Wolf, 1988) . Blue cat\u00aesh (Ictalurus furcatus) and white cat\u00aesh (I. catus) are susceptible to IcHV-1 (Wolf and Darlington, 1971; Plumb, 1989) . Horizontal transmission has been shown for IcHV-1. Nucleic acid-probing techniques give evidence for vertical transmission of IcHV-1 (Wise et al., 1988) . Diagnosis of IcHV-1 infection that according to the OIE induces a signi\u00aecant disease is carried out by IFAT, neutralization tests (Wolf, 1988) , ELISA (Crawford et al., 1999) , or PCR (Gray et al., 1999a) . Less than 0.1 pg of IcHV-1 viral DNA can be speci\u00aecally detected by PCR or nucleic acid-probing technique in acutely or latently infected cat\u00aesh (Plumb, 1989; Tham and Moon, 1996; Gray et al., 1999a, b) .
