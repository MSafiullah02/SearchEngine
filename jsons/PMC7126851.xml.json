            "text": "Large hospitals are organized into a variety of specialized nursing units. For example, telemetry units house patients under observation or those awaiting a surgical procedure, medical/surgical (med/surg) units house patients who are either recovering after a surgery or have a medical need requiring hospitalization, maternity units house new mothers and babies, and so on. This allows hospitals to have specialized equipment and nursing staff to care for patients with different care needs. Most nurses are assigned to specific units, although there are some that belong to a float pool\u2014i.e., they serve in different units depending on the needs. In some situations, nurses that are not in the float pool can be assigned to another unit on an ad hoc basis if the staffing level is higher than the nursing needs (nurse requirements) in their home unit and lower in another unit. However, nurses do not like involuntary floating[7].",

We refer to the former length of time as the review period and the latter as the lead time. For example, for a 4-week review period and a 6-week lead time, a nursing unit manager prepares a schedule that covers weeks seven through ten if the schedule is posted at week zero. This exercise is repeated every 4 weeks. In order to generate this schedule, the nursing unit manager needs a forecast of nursing needs for each shift several weeks in advance. Because such forecasts are invariably incorrect, mismatches between planned staffing levels and actual nursing needs are common, which necessitates considerable effort by managers to avoid understaffing in some shifts and overstaffing in others.",

In a 2008 Safe Nursing Staffing Poll [4], 23.8% of the nurses were considering leaving their jobs at the time of survey, and 42.0% among them reported that the reason was associated with inadequate staffing. This survey reveals one of the key reasons for avoiding understaffing from the nurses\u2019 viewpoint. Equally important is the consideration that inadequate staffing relative to the workload is unsafe for patients, being associated with increased instances of hospital-related mortality and failure to rescue [25], [3], [15]. Nursing unit managers deal with understaffing by using overtime or temporary staff, both of which are costly options for hospitals.",

Shortening the lengths of the review period and the lead time may help, but such changes are infrequent and perceived to be difficult to realize owing to provisions in nurses\u2019 contracts. Hospitals can eliminate specialized nursing units, but that can affect quality of care and lead to lower staff morale [6], [24]. Furthermore, general-purpose units exacerbate the nurse staffing problem because the care needs of the patients are more variable. These arguments suggest that for any new strategy or change in policy that is proposed to improve a nursing unit\u2019s ability to meet patient-care needs, it is necessary to have a methodology to evaluate its costs and benefits and to subsequently test those strategies/policies that perform well via pilot implementation studies. We report the first step in this process in which we develop a suite of models that can be used to evaluate a variety of flexibility enhancing strategies.",

In particular, we study an instance of staggering with two cohorts\u2014i.e. we divide the nurses assigned to a unit into two cohorts and schedule each cohort with a phase difference. If, for example, the review period is 4 weeks and the lead time is 6 weeks, we develop a schedule for each cohort that is phase shifted by 2 weeks. Each cohort still obtains its schedule every 4 weeks, which is set 6 weeks in advance, but the start of these 4-week periods for the two groups is offset by 2 weeks. A schematic of the staggering strategy is shown in Fig. 1\n. (In this figure and throughout the remainder of this paper, the review period is denoted by the Greek letter \u03c4.) Clearly, variants of this approach with more than two cohorts are possible. However, the complexity of the evaluation as well as the complexity of the implementation can be significantly higher with more cohorts.",

We begin with the forecasting literature first. There are many aggregate-level (regional or national) nursing demand forecasting models. A summary of available approaches can be found in O\u2019Brien-Pallas et al. [21]. Aggregate nursing demand forecasting approaches are not suitable for scheduling decisions at the level of a single unit, which require forecasts of medium-term nursing needs. Therefore, in this paper, we focus only on articles that are concerned with forecasts of nursing needs at the nursing-unit level over a 4- to 6-week time horizon.",

These are percent adjustment, moving average, trendline, and seasonalized forecasts. The percent-adjustment method is based on the percentage increase or decrease in the past twelve months of historical nurse requirements\u2014if there is \u00b1x% change the previous year, then it is estimated that the nursing needs will change by \u00b1x% in the following year as well. Trendline methods use linear regression on historical nurse requirements, with time as the explanatory variable, to determine if a trend exists. Both percent adjustment and trendline methods ignore possible seasonalities in nursing requirements. Moving average and seasonalized forecasts are common time-series based models. Moving average can work well when neither the seasonal nor the trend pattern is strong. Seasonalized forecast (with or without trend) is appropriate when repeating patterns are identified in the historical data. The forecast in each season is adjusted by the corresponding seasonal index. These approaches are widely used and discussed in many books; see, for example, Shumway and Stoffer [22].",

Typical nursing units have a variable staffing plan that converts each census level (by time of day) into a minimum number of registered nurses (RNs) needed to care for that many patients. The variable staffing plan is approximately based on nurse to patient ratios corresponding to an aggregate mix of patient acuity. We found that such practices are common at large hospitals, although not all hospitals use the terminology variable staffing plan.

It is for this reason that different units use different nurse-to-patient ratios. These ratios also vary by shift to account for shift-to-shift differences in workload due to doctors\u2019 orders, distribution of medications and meals, and various call-button requests. In addition, patient acuity is not constant over time and to our knowledge there is no database that updates patients\u2019 acuity information over time. Therefore, estimating patient acuity from available electronic records is not currently feasible.

Our experiment revealed that nurses used beginning-of-shift census to determine a base staffing level (from the variable staffing plan) and adjusted it upwards to account for the ADT activity and for additional nurses required for periods when census is higher than the starting census. Based on this evidence, our nursing needs\u2019 forecast model predicts for each shift, by day of week, the beginning census of a shift and the additional workload due to the change in patient numbers and ADT.

Upon comparing different forecasting methods, we found that in our example unit, the simple moving average procedure performed the best. Therefore, our forecasting model estimates the beginning census (by day of week) of each shift by the simple moving average of censuses of the most recent 52 weeks. The forecast of the workload adjustment due to ADT and increase in patient numbers during a shift is calculated by the long-term (1 year) average of extra nursing hours required, also by day of week and shift. We did not use moving average for the second component because this number is relatively stable for the unit we investigated. For a nursing unit with more variable ADT workload throughout the year, it may be more appropriate to use a different method to calculate the workload due to ADT. The forecast of the number of RNs required to meet the staffing needs are then calculated by applying the unit\u2019s nurse-to-patient ratio to the estimates of the beginning census and the additional workload from activities.",

Note, this table does not show unscheduled shifts and their cost is not included in calculating the performance of the schedule because it is possible in many cases to use the nurses\u2019 time for other purposes. That is, unscheduled shifts are not charged to direct patient care budget for the unit in question.",

A similar picture also emerges when we examine the number of shifts short (SH) and the number of shifts over (OV). The average shortage per 2-week period is 20.8 shifts and the average overage is 5.0 shifts if the forecast is updated every 4 weeks (\u03c4=4) and staggering is not used. When we compare this to the staggering strategy, the performance with staggering turns out to be slightly worse. At a first glance, the above observations appear counterintuitive because more frequent information updating is not expected to lead to worse results. However, upon careful consideration these results can be explained by the additional scheduling limitations imposed by the staggering strategy. Details are presented in the next section.",

We presented a general-purpose methodology for evaluating such approaches and evaluated an example, which we call schedule staggering, in this paper. Although more frequent forecast updating generally improves the accuracy of the forecast (this may not hold for every 2-week period due to noise in the data), the benefits of schedule staggering are not realized because scheduling becomes more constrained under staggering. The work schedule of half of the nurses is fixed at the time forecast is updated. Even when the updated forecast is more accurate, the hospital may not be in a position to utilize the benefits of staggering because of the various scheduling constraints that must be met. Therefore, the success of the staggering strategy depends on whether a hospital is able to utilize the improvement in forecast accuracy given more restricted scheduling flexibility because a proportion of the nurses\u2019 schedules are already fixed.",

The evaluation approach developed in this paper can be used to study the benefits of staggering in other hospitals for which scheduling constraints are less stringent, as well as the potential benefits of other strategies. Examples of other strategies include pooling nursing needs from several similar units (e.g. when a hospital has several telemetry or med/surge units) for the purpose of developing nurse schedules, using elective surgery booking information to improve nursing needs\u2019 forecasts, and choosing a hiring plan that strategically selects the weekday and weekend work patterns of additional hires. In each case, a schedule would be developed using the appropriate forecast as input and overall schedule performance would be ascertained in a manner similar to the example presented in Section 2. Finally, because most hospitals operate in non-stationary environments in terms of nursing needs, quantifying the benefits of learning approaches to improve nursing needs\u2019 forecasts is also a worthy topic for future research.",
