Methods: We used spatiotemporal data of COVID-19 cases in mainland China and two categories of location-based service (LBS) data of mobile devices from the primary and secondary epidemic sources to calculate Pearson correlation coefficient, r, and spatial stratified heterogeneity, q, statistics. Results: Two categories of device trajectories had generally significant correlations and determinant powers of the epidemic spread. Both r and q statistics decreased with distance from the epidemic sources and their associations changed with time. At the beginning of the epidemic, the mixed firstgeneration and second-generation spreads appeared in most cities with confirmed cases. They strongly interacted to enhance the epidemic in Hubei province and the trend was also significant in the provinces adjacent to Hubei. The third-generation spread started in Wuhan from January 17 to 20, 2020, and in Hubei from January 23 to 24. No obvious third-generation spread was detected outside Hubei.",

The novel coronavirus that infects human was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, on December 31, 2019 (Zhu et al. 2020) . Early confirmed cases were mainly linked to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan (Li et al. 2020a; Zhu et al. 2020) . Epidemiological studies indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic has a basic reproductive number between 2 and 3 (Li et al. 2020a; Wu et al. 2020) , which is lower than the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Lipsitch 2003; Riley et al. 2003) . Wuhan is a main transportation hub in central China, several million travelers ventured outward from the epidemic outbreak source in the first half of January, 2020, due to annual Chinese (Lunar) New Year holiday migrations. The large-scale outbreak started on January 19 (the first confirmed case reported outside Hubei province). Although strict transportation screening measures were activated by many cities in the next 3-4 days, the epidemic rapidly spread nationwide in a week. Moreover, COVID-19 infections have been identified in other countries and the current epidemic has become a global concern (Cohen and Normile 2020; Holshue et al. 2020; Rothe et al. 2020; . The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on January 30 (WHO 2020b) . There is evidence that the epidemic outbreak in China and elsewhere spread along the paths of travel from Wuhan (Li et al. 2020b) , and local outbreaks could appear in other major cities of China with time lags (Wu et al. 2020) .",

Control measures (e.g., travel quarantine and restrictions) in Wuhan were effective to delay the overall epidemic progression in mainland China and reduce the international case importations (Chinazzi et al. 2020) . The Huanan seafood wholesale market and Wuhan were recognized as the primary and secondary epidemic centers, respectively, and therefore, the movements of populations from the two sources influenced the generations of the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China, especially during the very early epidemic stage before the transportation measures activated by Wuhan and other cities. The first-generation (primary) spread of the epidemic was in part reflected by the human movement from the primary source (i.e., the seafood market), and the secondgeneration (secondary) spread was reflected by that from the secondary center (i.e., Wuhan city). They varied and interacted by region and time during the early epidemic progression, and had the potential clues to identify the third-generation spreads in various regions, which are mainly caused by the local cases instead of the imported ones. Here, using location-based service (LBS) data of mobile devices, we analyzed the spatiotemporal association of the confirmed COVID-19 cases and human movements from the sources of the epidemic outbreak, and revealed the first, second and potential third generation spreads of the COVID-19 epidemic in mainland China.",

Their traces were aggregated by date in administrative cities and linked to the spatiotemporal confirmed cases. It is notable that the COVID-19 outbreak had a strong consistency with human migrations from the epidemic sources. The confirmed cases had a clear linear correlation with two categories of trajectories from the sources to the rest of the nation. Moreover, both trajectory categories could generally indicate the epidemic spread in Hubei province and explain to a certain extent the SSH of the spread from Wuhan to the rest of Hubei province and throughout the rest of China. Our analyses provide a new perspective to explore the spread of the epidemics linked to human movement.",

The majority of cities with confirmed cases had a mixed pattern of first-generation and second-generation spreads at the very beginning of the outbreak. Many cities activated quick response within 3-4 days and achieved efficient results in inhibiting the first-generation spread outside Hubei province. However, it still had a significant impact in Hubei province, especially playing the dominant role inside Wuhan city. Furthermore, among the other cities in Hubei province, the first-generation and second-generation spreads enhanced each other with a much higher interaction q statistic. This might be another signal to identify the potential start date of the third-generation spread in a specific area. Due to the quick response and strict control measures in many cities, the interaction enhancement of the firstgeneration and second-generation spreads had a weak strength outside Hubei province. There is no evidence that any third-generation spread appeared outside Hubei in mainland China in the first week of the outbreak. Nevertheless, Hubei's adjacent provinces require more effective control measures, since the first-generation and second-generation spreads had an increasing trend.",

Two categories of LBS-requesting mobile devices were used in this study to identify the potential close contacts to the primary and secondary epidemic sources. The datasets covered most devices with LBS requests in the given region and time period. However, the linkage between mobile devices and populations could be subject to information loss (e.g., users may replace their mobile devices with new ones). It is also extremely difficult to cover 100% potential close contacts in our datasets. The close contacts of these two populations while traveling before/after the outbreak were not collected, and therefore we cannot estimate the potential third-generation cases and their movements. This limitation involves future work with more universal-source data and high-performance computing capabilities. The COVID-19 epidemic data were collected through publicly available sources, and we processed the data of confirmed cases and device traces in the spatial scale of cities. Small-scale analyses could be more helpful to construct epidemic control programs in counties or communities within a city.",

This approach has made it possible to assess the start date of the third-generation spreads of COVID-19 epidemic and the interactions between first-generation and second-generation spreads across various regions all over the country. The proposed technique incorporating location-based service data of mobile devices can help identify the spatiotemporal generations at the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. It can be easily implemented and extended to the early exploratory study of other epidemics similar to COVID-19. The results indicate the spatiotemporal characteristics of the epidemic spread associated to human movements from epidemic sources and the potential spatiotemporal risks at the early stage of the outbreak. Control measures varying by location and time could be executed in different levels for various regions. For instance, cities with obvious third-generation spread require the strictest controls on both the exportations and the inside quarantine, cities should pay more attention to the importations and the inside quarantine if the first-generation and second-generation spreads have the strong interactive enhancements, and other cities require to focus on the control of the importations.",

The trend of the interactions between the first-generation and second-generation spreads was significant in the provinces adjacent to Hubei. The associations between the epidemic spread decreased with distance and had different temporal pattens from the epidemic sources, implying the potential epidemic generation-togeneration evolution on regional spatial scales. At the very beginning of the outbreak, the mixed first-generation and second-generation spreads appeared in most cities with confirmed cases. No obvious third-generation spread was detected outside Hubei province. The strict transportation measures implemented in many cities appeared to have been effective in preventing any thirdgeneration spread nationwide. The urgent control measures in Hubei province include weakening the third-generation spread and the interaction influence of the first-generation and secondgeneration spreads. Even with strict control strategies, effective measures to reduce transmission in the community are still required (Li et al. 2020a) . A large increase in migration due to people returning from travel after the New Year holiday also introduces challenges to epidemic control . We recommend the urgent control measures of preventing potential thirdgeneration spread in mainland China, eliminating it in Hubei, and reducing the interaction influence of first-generation and second-generation spreads.",
