Using this technology, carbohydrate-containing macromolecules of diverse structures, including polysaccharides, natural glycoconjugates, and mono-and oligosaccharides coupled to carrier molecules, can be stably immobilized on a glass chip without chemical modification. Here, we describe a practical protocol for this technology. We hope that anyone who has access to a standard cDNA microarray facility will be able to explore this technology for his or her own research interest. We also provide an example to illustrate that the carbohydrate microarray is also a discovery tool; this is particularly useful for identifying immunologic sugar moieties, including complex carbohydrates of cancer cells and sugar signatures of previously unrecognized microbial pathogens.",

ASOR is an abundant human serum glycoprotein, and the ASORtype complex carbohydrates are also expressed by other host glycoproteins  (19,20) . Thus, the human immune system is generally nonresponsive to these \"self \" carbohydrate structures. However, when similar sugar moieties were expressed by a viral glycoprotein, their cluster configuration could differ significantly from those displayed by a cellular glycan, thereby generating a novel \"non-self\" antigenic structure. A documented example of such an antigenic structure is a broad-range HIV-1 neutralization epitope recognized by a monoclonal antibody 2G12. This antibody is specific for a unique cluster of sugar chains displayed by the gp120 glycoprotein of HIV-1 (21) . It is, thus, important to examine whether naturally occurring SARS-CoV expresses the ASOR-type autoimmune reactive sugar moieties. In addition, a number of cellular receptors that bind the ASOR complex carbohydrate have been identified (20, 22) . This study provided clues to explore the possible roles of carbohydrate-mediated receptor-ligand interactions in SARS-CoV infection, especially in determining host-range and tissue-tropic characteristics of the virus.",

            "text": "In summary, our laboratory has established a simple, precise, and highly efficient experimental approach for the construction of carbohydrate microarrays ( [16] [17] [18] . This approach makes use of existing cDNA microarray systems, including the spotter and scanner, for carbohydrate array production. A key technical element of this array platform is the introduction of nitrocellulosecoated microglass slides to immobilize unmodified carbohydrate antigens on the chip surface noncovalently. This technology has achieved the sensitivity to recognize the profiles of human anti-carbohydrate antibodies with as little as a few microliters of serum specimen, and reached the chip capacity to include the antigenic preparations of most common pathogens (approx 20,000 microspots per biochip). We describe in this chapter a practical protocol of this platform of carbohydrate microarrays. However, we would like to take this opportunity to refer our readers to other technology platforms of carbohydrate microarrays or glycan chips (23-28). This progess, especially the availability of different technological platforms to meet the multiple needs of carbohydrate research, marks an important developmental stage of chemical genomics research, approaching the era of the glycome.",

            "text": "1. Antigen preparations suitable for this high-throughput biochip platform: Carbohydrate antigens of multiple structural configurations, including polysaccharides, natural glycoconjugates, and oligosaccharide-protein and oligosaccharide-lipid conjugates, are applicable for this microarray platform (16,18,25) . In addition to printing carbohydrate microarrays, the current platform is also applicable for producing protein microarrays (17). As with carbohydrate microarrays, there is no need to chemically conjugate a protein for its surface immobilization. However, it is recommended that each antigen preparation be tested on chip substrate for the efficacy of immobilization and expression of antigenic determinants. 2. Preservation of polysaccharides: Purified polysaccharides are generally stored as dried powder at room temperature. They can also be preserved in saline solutions (0.9% NaCl) containing a droplet of chloroform, and stored at 4\u00b0C for a long period of time. 3. Printing of samples: Before loading sample solutions onto the arrayer, it is important to spin the solution in an Eppendorf centrifuge at maximum speed (at least 15,000g) for at least 15 min. Before and after each arraying experiment, we recommend examining and cleaning the printing pins. A test slide is usually implemented to optimize quality of printing. The water supply of the Cartesian Arrayer should constantly be checked during the arraying experiment to ensure adequate flow to the wash chamber. 4. Examination of presence of samples on array: To verify that proteins, synthetic peptides, and carbohydrates are successfully printed, microarrays can be incubated with antibodies, receptors, or lectins known to react with the printed substance. The reaction is detected either by conjugating directly a fluorochrome to the detector, or by a second-step staining procedure. 5. Storage of printed carbohydrate and protein microarrays: The arrays are usually air dried and stored at room temperature. For long-term preservation, the chips can be sealed in a plastic bag with desiccant and stored at 4\u00b0C. 6. Staining considerations: After the last wash between each staining step, it is important to completely withdraw the wash buffer inside the reaction chambers; otherwise, the remaining buffer may lower the concentration of the antibodies to be analyzed. 7. Data analysis: Training with the technical experts of PerkinElmer is necessary before performing microarray data analysis using the software package. 8. Biosafety procedures: When working with chemicals, suitable protective wear, such as lab coat and disposable gloves, are advised. When human serum specimens are involved, experiments must be conducted in accordance to the standard biosafety procedures as instructed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO).",
