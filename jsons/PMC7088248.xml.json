This was one of the strong political issues in favour of health, which still holds true. But only a few countries support the idea\u2014and realize it\u2014that health and education shall be guaranteed by law and law enforcement for everyone in society. Germany still is that old fashioned with its nearly universal coverage of a social health insurance and the inclusion of nearly complete services for nearly all complaints. It is an offspring of a social market economy, which intends to cover basic needs for all, based on solidarity and subsidiarity. Solidarity is incorporated, for example, in the income-based premiums for about 90% of the German population. Subsidiarity is shown in the fact that public legal corporations run the business and that these corporations are democratically elected. Sustainability, nevertheless, will require a strengthening of the subsidiarity principle in the sense that people must take basic health (care) into their own hands. Health is not only the state\u2019s responsibility, but also a responsibility that rests on the people. Thus, such a patterning of health affairs is based on values and principles\u2014the health sector in Germany is a very interesting policy area with structural implications and messages for other sectors. Solidarity and subsidiarity could pattern other policies, as well. This could support a global structural policy that creates, stabilizes and protects the very preconditions for a healthy and stable global society.",

The vicious circle between poverty, infection, and malnutrition still exists on a large scale. This is the so-called unfinished agenda in international health. About 200 million life years are lost yearly because of malnutrition and 85 million life years resulting from poor water and sanitation (World Bank 1997). Many other diseases are directly linked to poverty. Poor countries have difficulties in tackling these diseases: 11% of global health spending goes for 93% of the global disease burden (Gwatkin 2000).

Simply increasing income would not suffice, because of wide-spread lack of empowerment and because of the many life shocks that the poor experience, which quite often absorb any additional income. On behalf of the World Bank, more than 60,000 poor in more than 60 countries were interviewed in an attempt to understand poverty. The book series Voices of the poor is a very remarkable background document of the millennium declarations (Narayan 1999, 2000). Analysing carefully its content, it turns out that severe illness or accidents of family members can drain away any savings intended to be used for small entrepreneurial activities or for other emergencies. Solidarity within larger family networks absorbs any additional income. In India, for example, 25% of hospitalized patients\u2019 families fall into poverty from medical costs (Peters et al. 2002). High private expenditures of some hospitalizations even throw middle class families into poverty if there is no social security net for health care. Good health insurance and hospital coverage for the poor are the preconditions necessary to develop and support family subsistence initiatives and small scale enterprises, which are needed urgently in view of increasing unemployment and underemployment in times of globalisation and resulting shrinking labour markets.",

Larger families are considered to be a result of and a risk factor for poverty. The smaller the families are the higher their human capital is.

Investments in education, housing and other social arrangements added to this health-led development.Many case studies from developing and transition economies after economic crises hint at the important pre-investments in health and education for subsequent economic growth; Sweden, Kerala and Costa Rica benefited from health-driven developments, whereas economy-driven developments such as in Brazil, India and Pakistan did not substantially benefit the poorest.The African American population in the USA enjoys relatively high income levels and\u2014as compared to much poorer populations in China and Kerala\u2014low survival prospects. \u201cIt turns out that Chinese men and those in Kerala in India decisively outlive American black men in terms of surviving to older age groups\u201d (Sen 1999).Macroeconomic shocks in Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and especially in Central Asia had very negative impacts on health because of lacking pre-investments in health and education. The excess mortality in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine between 1990 and 2000 was at 4 million people (Cornia 2001).Finally, many econometric studies show that health is a long-term driver for economic growth.

These capabilities are to be shaped by culture and socialization, and supported by education and training. Health and education are the very production factors for development. \u201cDevelopment has to be primarily concerned with enhancing the lives we lead and the freedoms that we enjoy. And among the most important freedoms that we can have is the freedom from avoidable ill-health and from escapable mortality\u201d (Sen 1999). The goal of development is not the absence of diseases but to use brain (education) and body (health) rightly to improve our lives, living conditions and freedoms. This would be a bottom-up development. Health and education\u2014bodies and brains\u2014are not just any factor of production but the most essential human factors of production and development.",

With a slightly different meaning and linking these components functionally, they can show a new direction for reasonable interventions in health: the empowerment of people in a situation of security creates opportunities for development.\u201cEmpowerment is based on:Programmes to strengthen subsidiarity, e.g. through building up the capacity of the poor for prevention and informed self-help and through human resource development of other people, partners and professionals that provide good back-up for both decentralization and participation.Best practices of self-reliant reproductive health (care) as key area of concern and application for empowering people to take health and quality health care into their own hands; productive health (care) measures are added in the context of the macroeconomics and health debate.\nSecurity is supported and reinforced by:Sustainable social sector reforms with a clear focus on good governance and stewardship, a strengthening of social institutions such as decentralization and participation, and a fair health care financing system aiming at solidarity.Social health insurance that includes the care of catastrophic cases of the poor and indigents and that are based on a cost-effective high quality in health and hospital care and aimed at building up reasonable broader social security systems.\nOpportunities will thus be created in terms of human and social capital. This is an essential ingredient of economic growth, democratic development, cultural wealth, and human progress\u201d (Schwefel 2002).\n",

But this is certainly not enough; it is just the continuation of good but old-fashioned recipes. What is especially important is a drive towards \u201chealth in the hands of the people\u201d, i.e. empowerment for an educated responsibility for health and informed self-help, the so-called education-vaccine that is especially effective and efficient against HIV/AIDS, for example. It requires alliances with the education sectors. And it requires commitment (Schwefel 2001).

The Spanish government\u2014long ago, in 1984\u2014invited many partners from all over the world, to consult its preparation of a new health law; even the government of Guatemala did something similar by the year 1999 in its health reform agenda (Proyecto 1999). In Europe and around the world, European health care has four fundamental and not yet fully used opportunities of exchange and development (Chanda 2001):1. Cross-boundary consultation and therapy in selected disciplines, supported for example by telemedicine2.Domestic care of foreign patients3.Corporate presence abroad, especially in the areas of drugs, biotechnology and technical medical devices4.Temporary migration of highly qualified personnel, especially for health system consultations in solidarity, subsidiarity, self-help and social market economy.The health sector is a sector of economic growth with a strategically important potential.",
