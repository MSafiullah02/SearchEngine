Nine of 10 epidemiological studies reviewed showed that handwashing was protective against SARS when comparing infected cases and non-infected controls in univariate analysis, but only in three studies was this result statistically significant in multivariate analysis. There is reason to believe that this is because most of the studies were too small. The evidence for the effectiveness of handwashing as a measure against SARS transmission in health care and community settings is suggestive, but not conclusive.",

The first is that certain pathogens might cause both. The second is transmission through hand contact with fomites. Both enteric and respiratory pathogens are often transmitted on surfaces of domestic and communal objects. Frequent contact between fomites, hands and faces is a likely transmission route. Handwashing (preferably with soap) can interrupt this transmission. The SARS outbreak has given this issue greater urgency. In a recent review of SARS prevention measures, Gamage et al. (2005) mentioned handwashing as a type of environmental decontamination. However, they located only the study by Seto et al. (2003) and not the others discussed below.",
