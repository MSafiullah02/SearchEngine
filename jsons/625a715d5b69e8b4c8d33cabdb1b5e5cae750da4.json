These factors are contributing to the exacerbation of public health and environmental problems, pressure on food production and distribution, and the illegal transport and trade in livestock, food products and people. The livestock sector represents almost half of the world's agricultural economy. Recent animal health emergencies have highlighted the vulnerability of the livestock sector to the impact of infectious diseases and the associated risks to human health (FAO/OIE 2004) . Outbreaks resulting from wildlife trade have resulted in enormous economic losses globally (Karesh et al. 2005) . In addition, the world is seeing unprecedented levels of international travel that has facilitated the spread of infectious diseases. The International Civil Aviation Organization estimates that air travel among its 185 members will reach two billion passengers annually by (ICAO Circular 2005 .",

Considerable resources by the agricultural and animal health sectors go into modelling risk and the economic impact of crises in consumer confidence resulting from animal diseases or infected animal products (University of Sydney FAH Report 2005). On a global level, the human health sector lags behind the animal health sector in the assessment of potential threats, although substantive differences exist among countries in their national preparedness planning for emerging diseases. Until recently, little attention has been given to determining the direct and indirect costs of human disease outbreaks, including morbidity and excess mortality, health service delivery costs, public health expenditure, the psychosocial impact on affected individuals, families and communities, the economic impact on travel, tourism and the insurance industry, and loss of confidence in governments and health services.",

The health and socioeconomic impact of zoonoses are increasingly being felt most particularly, although not exclusively, by developing countries (Seimenis 1998) . The lack of surveillance data on emerging zoonoses from many developing countries means that the burden of human, livestock and wildlife disease is underestimated and opportunities for control interventions thereby limited (see the chapters by Childs, by Nel and Rupprecht, and by Stallknecht, this volume).",

The AIDS epidemic caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is one of the most destructive pandemics in human history (UNAIDS 2005) . Since its recognition in 1981, AIDS has killed over 25 million people and an estimated 40.3 million people were living with HIV/AIDS in 2005. HIV emerged from at least two nonhuman primate reservoirs in Africa in the 1950s (Hahn et al. 2000) . There are currently 33 nonhuman primates known to harbour their own unique simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains (Kalish et al. 2005 ) and primate bush meat has a high prevalence of SIV (Peeters et al. 2002) . In a study of 16 SIV isolates from five different primate species, 12 were able to infect human monocyte-derived macrophages, while 11 showed replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, although the authors state that cell tropism does not necessarily predict virus pathogenicity in vivo (Grimm et al. 2003) . Hunters in sub-Saharan Africa continue to be exposed to SIV during hunting and butchering nonhuman primates such as chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys, or by keeping wild primates as pets (Kalish et al. 2005 ; see the chapter by Daszak et al., this volume) . Such spillover events have implications for the safety of the blood supply through the genesis of new HIV strains that are not detected by current HIV tests (Kalish et al. 2005) .",

Genotyping virus from the Bangladesh outbreaks have showed a 95% homology with isolates from the Malaysian outbreak in 1999. In outbreaks in the Meherpur district (2001) and Faridpur district (2004), direct contact with the secretions of ill patients is thought to have played a role in transmission of the disease (Hsu et al. 2004; ICDDR,B 2004b; WHO 2004a) . In the outbreak in Naogaon district (2003), cases were associated with exposure to a herd of pigs (ICDDR,B 2004a) . In Goalanda, Rajbari district, nine of the 12 Nipah cases were boys under 19 years who climbed trees where fruit bats fed overnight (WHO 2004a) . Contamination is thought to have occurred while eating the same fruits, although whether infection was a result of ingestion or contact transmission was not determined. In January 2005, 12 cases of Nipah virus were reported in Basail Upazila, Tangail District, of whom 11 died (92%) (ICDDR,B 2005) . The only significant exposure associated with illness was drinking raw date palm juice, which is consumed within a few hours of collection. Date palm juice potentially contaminated with the saliva and/or urine of Pteropus giganteus , the species of fruit bat widely distributed throughout Bangladesh, is considered the most likely source of transmission.",

The Himalayan masked palm civet ( Paguma larvata ) is considered the source of infection in humans (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium 2004; Guan et al. 2003; Kan et al. 2005) . One reservoir of SARS-like coronaviruses closely related to those responsible for the SARS outbreak is now known to be cave-dwelling bats in the genus Rhinolophus (Chinese horseshoe bats) . These viruses, termed SARS-like coronaviruses, display greater genetic variation than SARS-CoV isolated from humans or from civets. The SARS epidemic demonstrated that even in well-resourced countries, the initial response to SARS was hindered by inadequate disease surveillance systems, poor communication and information sharing, and insufficient public health capacity. Unprecedented levels of international travel and trade enabled the rapid spread of SARS within and between continents. In global terms, SARS was a small epidemic resulting in just over 8,000 cases and 774 deaths (WHO 2004b) . However, SARS severely challenged the capacity of curative and preventive health services, including the ability of public health services in unaffected countries to investigate suspected cases of SARS. The epidemic temporarily reduced consumer confidence in Asia, costing Asian economies US $11-18 billiion and resulting in estimated losses of 0.5%-2% of total output according to official macroeconomic data, and economic impact studies from international financial institutions, industry associations, and public policy research institutions (US General Accounting Office 2004). SARS had significant, but temporary, negative effects on a variety of economic activities, especially travel and tourism even in unaffected countries. Tourism fell by 9.7% in the Asia Pacific region as a direct result of SARS (Department of Tourism, Industry and Resources 2004).",

In 2004, concurrent with outbreaks of avian influenza in poultry, a total of 147 of 441 tigers ( Panthera tigris ) and two leopards ( P. pardus ) kept in the zoo in Suphanburi, Thailand, died after an acute respiratory illness with high fever or were euthanised to prevent possible spread to other zoo animals. The aetiological agent was subsequently confirmed as A/H5N1 avian influenza. The animals had been fed raw chicken carcasses that were contaminated with the A/H5N1 virus (Keawcharoen et al. 2004) . Cases occurring 12 days after the tigers were last fed raw poultry were attributed to tiger-to-tiger transmission (Thanawonghuwech et al. 2005) . During the outbreak, there were also anecdotal reports of fatal A/H5N1 virus infection in domestic cats, previously thought to be resistant to influenza A infections (ProMed mail 2004). When cats ( n = 3) were experimentally infected with A/H5N1 virus isolated from a fatal human case in Vietnam (A/Vietnam/1194/04), they exhibited respiratory symptoms, diffuse alveolar damage and excreted virus at 3 days post-infection ; see the chapter by Webby et al., this volume). Three control cats inoculated with a human A/H3N2 virus isolate from a human (A/Netherlands/18/94) showed no evidence of infection or disease. The study also demonstrated that cats could be infected with A/H5N1 virus both by horizontal transmission and by feeding on virus-infected birds ). There is considerable concern that other carnivores may also be susceptible to infection through eating infected poultry or infected wild birds.",

The risk of further human cases continues, as do opportunities for a human-adapted pandemic strain to emerge following a recombination event. Kuiken et al. concluded that cats might also enable the adaptation of A/H5N1 to mammals, thereby increasing the risk of a human influenza pandemic ).

Its infective nature was first described in 1935 following transmission studies in sheep that involved the intraocular inoculation of a healthy ewe with infected sheep spinal cord tissue. Disease surveillance, herd depopulation and selective breeding programs were proving successful control measures until recently. There is a well-established association between sheep prion protein genotype and the risk of death from scrapie (Baylis et al. 2004) . Certain genotypes are associated with susceptibility to the disease and others with resistance. The intensified surveillance of scrapie in the European Union, together with the improvement of PrP Sc detection techniques, has led to the discovery of a growing number of atypical scrapie cases. In 2002, researchers in Germany, Portugal and France identified a variant form of scrapie that appears to infect sheep of the genotype ARR/ARR purposefully bred in Europe as a lineage resistant to scrapie (LeDur et al. 2005; Roden et al. 2006) . The prion proteins of the variant form accumulate in different parts of the brain, have different biochemical properties and produce a spectrum of disease that differs slightly from traditional scrapie. Inoculation of transgenic mice expressing ovine PrP with material from three sheep homozygous for the resistant PrP(ARR) allele efficiently transmitted the disease to the mice. These observations suggest that a previously unrecognised infectious TSE agent infects sheep flocks (LeDur et al. 2005) and may have important implications in terms of scrapie control and public health.",

Mathematical modelling indicates that the epidemic began in the mid-1970s and that approximately one million cattle must have been infected and entered the food supply. Current evidence supports the hypothesis that BSE originated from the recycling of cattle infected with a scrapie-like agent derived from either sheep or cattle in feed containing rendered meat and bonemeal. Changes to the rendering process from the 1970s to the early 1980s appear to have reduced the inactivation of PrP Sc and enabled propagation of the agent. BSE became a notifiable disease in the UK in June 1988, and soon afterwards, a ban on the feeding of ruminant-derived protein to ruminants became mandatory. The ban was extended to specified high-risk bovine offals (SBOs) for human consumption in November 1989 based on the infectivity of tissues of scrapie-infected sheep, and in September 1990 SBOs were prohibited for use in feed for all animals and birds in the UK. The BSE epidemic in Britain peaked at the end of 1992 when 37,280 incident cases were detected and then declined rapidly, although a small number of cases continued to occur (Enserink 2005; OIE 2005a ). In 2004, 343 cases were reported in Britain and just over 150 in 2005. BSE in animals born after the ruminant feed ban have been attributed to exposure to contaminated feed after the ban, maternal transmission or other unidentified routes of transmission. In October 2004, French researchers confirmed a TSE in a goat slaughtered in 2002 that could not be distinguished from BSE on the mouse bioassay which takes 2 years to complete (Europa 2004 ). One additional goat tested positive of 140,000 goats examined from April 2002 to January 2005.",

In some of these countries, BSE-affected cattle were detected even after a probabilistic risk assessment integrating release, exposure and consequence assessments indicated a negligible probability that BSE was introduced and established (Morley et al. 2003) . Materials potentially contaminated with the BSE agent had been distributed around the world through the trade in live cattle and cattle by-products before export bans and import risk assessments were put into place. These products include a range of high-risk materials, some masked by trading patterns that have included processing and re-exportation of hazardous products. The occurrence of BSE in cattle in Europe and elsewhere raised new concerns about the precautions needed to ensure the safety of the international trade of cattle and cattle products. Many countries still have no monitoring systems or insensitive surveillance in place for BSE and may not have the financial and response capacity to eliminate BSE should cases occur. From 2001 to 2004, abattoir-based testing of asymptomatic cattle for BSE in European Union countries cost \u20ac1.6 million per BSE case detected, with an overall cost of approximately \u20ac1.6 billion (Enserink 2005) .",

The new form was designated variant-CJD. Consumption of BSE-infected beef products, particularly mechanically recovered meat, is the most likely route of transmission in humans. These cases were temporally and geographically linked to outbreaks of BSE, making an aetiological link highly likely. Several different PrP Sc types in humans have been identified, each associated with a different clinical phenotype of CJD. Strain-typing experiments have shown that the vCJD agent is different from that causing sporadic CJD but similar to the BSE agent. Humans that are homozygous (methionine/methionine) at codon 129 are more susceptible to both variant and sporadic CJD. All but one of the cases of vCJD to date has been homozygous at codon 129; the single heterozygous (methionine/valine) case was infected via a blood transfusion and demonstrated for the first time that codon 129-heterozygous individuals are susceptible to vCJD infection (Peden et al. 2004) . Speculation continues on whether cases of vCJD with very long incubation periods will occur among individuals heterozygous or homozygous (valine/valine) at codon 129 who were exposed to high-risk beef products before the bans.",

Epidemiological studies of lymphoreticular system tissues have shown a low, but measurable, carrier state in vCJD. PrP Sc has been found in appendix, spleen, tonsil and lymph nodes of patients with vCJD, and in this regard differs to other human TSEs (Hill et al. 1999 ). TSEs are highly resistant to the sterilisation and equipment reprocessing techniques that readily destroy bacterial and viral pathogens and have radically changed the practice of infection control during surgical and invasive diagnostic procedures. The widespread distribution of PrP Sc throughout the lymphoid and central nervous systems raises concerns about the risk of transmission through surgical and ophthalmological procedures (Dunstan and Alpers 2005) . The appearance of vCJD has also challenged the safety of the blood supply and organ donation. Changes in surgical practices, such as the use of disposable equipment for common procedures and the need to destroy or quarantine expensive equipment that would previously have been reprocessed for use, have resulted in considerable costs to health care systems around the world.",

The ongoing risk of interspecies transmission of TSEs needs careful assessment (Ramasamy 2004) in view of the experimental evidence that tissues from subclinically infected animals (Race and Chesebro 1998) can be infectious to other species.",

It is becoming increasingly apparent that bats are the reservoirs for a number of pathogenic viruses (Calisher et al. 2006; Field et al. 2004 ; see the chapter by Field et al., this volume) , including rabies (Warrell and Warrell 2004 ; see the chapter by Nel and Rupprecht, this volume), the Australian bat lyssavirus (Fraser et al. 1996; Field et al. 1999 Field et al. , 2004 Gould et al. 2002; Warrell and Warrell 2004) , henipaviruses (Eaton et al. 2006) , SARS-like coronaviruses , and Ebola virus ; see the chapter by Gonzalez et al., this volume), and are considered candidate reservoirs for Marburg virus ; see the chapter by Gonzalez et al., this volume). Other taxa may also prove to have co-evolved with a variety of viruses pathogenic for humans and animals (Peterson et al. 2004) . For some emerging zoonoses, limited knowledge of these relationships, especially for wildlife diseases, makes the risk assessment of spillover particularly difficult (Polley 2005) , thereby also limiting our ability to design interventions that will reduce opportunities for interspecies transmission.",

The Strategy aims to minimise the health, economic and social impact of emerging diseases through a targeted program of capacity building for public health surveillance and outbreak response in accordance with the core requirements of the IHR. Similar strategies are being implemented through a variety of public health networks in other WHO regions. Reducing the risk of diseases acquired from animals is a key objective of the Asia Pacific Strategy, which describes a broad, multinational, and multisectoral approach over the medium to long term. Success in the prevention and control of emerging zoonoses will require close collaboration between local and national health, agriculture, wildlife and food safety authorities in parallel with risk reduction activities involving international organisations such as WHO, FAO and OIE.",

The Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2005) (OIE 2005b) aims to assure the sanitary safety of international trade in terrestrial animals and their products through health measures to be used by national veterinary authorities to avoid the transfer of agents pathogenic for animals or humans, while avoiding unjustified sanitary barriers. The Terrestrial Code states that \"countries shall make available to other countries, through the OIE, whatever information is necessary to minimise the spread of important animal diseases and to assist in achieving better worldwide control of these diseases\". The Terrestrial Code lists procedures for the international reporting of diseases, ethical rules for international trade, certification and animal welfare, the principles of import risk analysis, and the organisation of import and export procedures. There are a large number of notifiable animal diseases under international surveillance: anthrax, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever, highly pathogenic avian influenza, hydatid disease, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, Nipah virus encephalitis, Q fever, Rift Valley fever, Salmonella enteritidis and S. typhimurium in poultry, screwworm, trichinellosis, tularaemia, and West Nile fever have the potential to cause human disease. National disease control requirements under the Terrestrial Code identify the need for a formal and ongoing system for detecting and investigating outbreaks of disease, procedures for the rapid collection and transport of clinical specimens, laboratory investigation guidelines for diagnostic quality assurance and a system for recording, managing and analysing diagnostic and surveillance data. In addition, the Terrestrial Code makes recommendations for the standardised monitoring of antimicrobials used in animal husbandry to evaluate usage patterns by animal species, antimicrobial class, potency and type of use in order to evaluate antimicrobial use and detect the emergence of resistance. Antimicrobial resistance may also have implications for antimicrobial efficacy in human health and in wildlife.",

West Nile virus occurs over a broad geographic range and in diverse vertebrate hosts and vector species. Until recently, there were few reports of deaths in wild birds and a small number of cases of equine encephalitis. Mortality in domestic birds was first reported in Israel in 1997 (Banet-Noach et al. 2003) , and encephalitis was reported in horses in Italy in 1998 (Cantile et al. 2000) and France in 2000 (Murque et al. 2001 . In 1999, West Nile virus caused an outbreak of encephalitis in humans in the New York area concurrent with cases of equine encephalitis and deaths in crows and other native and exotic bird species. A mortality surveillance system for the rapid detection of West Nile virus was implemented as an integrated response between wildlife health and public health agencies (McLean et al. 2002) . The death of nonhuman primates has been associated with outbreaks of Ebola haemorrhagic fever . Wild animal outbreaks began before each of the five human Ebola outbreaks in the forest zone between Gabon and Republic of Congo. All human Ebola virus outbreaks from 2001 to 2003 in that area resulted from handling infected wild animal carcasses. Through the establishment of an animal mortality monitoring network, health authorities were twice alerted to the imminent risk of a human Ebola outbreak weeks before they occurred .",

Because information of zoonotic disease occurrence in animals is important to public health officials, WHO, FAO and OIE developed GLEWS, the Global Early Warning and Response System for Major Animal Diseases, including Zoonoses, to combine information from each organization so that outbreaks can be detected earlier and the coordination of response to emerging zoonoses improved (WHO/FAO/OIE 2004).",

Following an outbreak of A/H5N1 in Hong Kong in 1997 that resulted in 18 cases and six deaths, control measures aimed at reducing exposure of humans to potential H5-infected poultry were instituted and included culling of all poultry in Hong Kong, the segregation of waterfowl and chickens, the introduction of import control measures for chickens and waterfowl and central slaughtering of waterfowl (Tam 2002) . Following illness caused by influenza A/H9N2 (G1) strain in two children in Hong Kong in 1999, closing down retail poultry markets for 1 day per month and subsequent exclusion of quail from live bird markets reduced the rate of A/H9N2 avian influenza virus (especially the G1 strain) in market birds (Kung et al. 2003) .",

According to that plan, the key elements of laboratory security are systematic site reviews of physical security, data security, employee security, access controls to laboratory and animal areas, procedures for agent inventory and accountability; controls on shipping or transfer and receiving of select agents, incident and injury policies and emergency response plans, and a mechanism to investigate and address breaches in security.

Standard precautions, especially handwashing, should always be followed and barrier protection used (gloves, gowns, eye protection) when handling clinical specimens.

            "text": "). The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) received the first report of its re-emergence on 12 December 2003 from the Republic of Korea. The disease spread rapidly within South-East Asia (Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand and Viet Nam), had infected domestic poultry flocks and wild birds in Russia, Kazakhstan and Mongolia by July 2005, and Romania, Croatia and Turkey by October 2005, confirming the westward spread of the virus (FAO 2005; see the chapter by Webby et al., this volume). Evidence shows that the A/H5N1 virus is now enzootic in many parts of Asia and is spreading rapidly in Europe. One estimate of the direct costs to the agricultural sector in Cambodia, Thailand and Viet Nam is of the order of US $560 million (McLeod 2005). Genetic analyses of isolates from Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Romania, Russia and Turkey show a close genetic relationship to wild bird isolates from the Qinghai Lake outbreak, China. Outbreaks of A/H5N1 have recurred despite aggressive control measures, including the culling of millions of poultry since December 2003. At the time of writing in January 2006, human cases with an overall fatality rate around 50% have been reported in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Thailand, Turkey and Viet Nam (see the chapter by Webby et al., this volume).",
