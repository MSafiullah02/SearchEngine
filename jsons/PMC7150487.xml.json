LFA is also cost-effective that allows the easy access to large populations in resource-limited settings. A standard LFA is performed on a paper-based device, and its architecture consists of a sample pad, a conjugation pad, a capillary membrane, and an absorbent pad on a plastic backing card (Figure 1A). For a sandwich-type LFA, the presence of both test and control bands indicates a positive result (Figure 1B). Alternatively, competitive-type LFA is developed with opposite sensing mode. Details of this LFA format could be found in published work elsewhere 4.",

In fact, the conventional LFA is intentionally designed for qualitative (i.e., yes or no) or semi-quantitative (refers to a color chart) tests so that the results could be read directly by naked eyes without additional instruments 6. Thus, it only works for the tasks that involve a high concentration of analytes (e.g., ng/mL). These intrinsic limitations prevent the conventional LFA from becoming modern POC diagnostics. For example, the early-stage detection and management of severe and infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19, 7) requires rapid and sensitive detection at low analyte concentrations. So far, the analytical performance of conventional LFA is often insufficient to be standalone tests.",

Considering that the detection agent is the key for the signal generation, one idea is to utilize them with stronger signals to improve the diagnostic performance of LFA 8, 9. Therefore, different types of detection agents have been developed including organic dyes 10, quantum dots 11, 12, upconverting nanoparticles (NPs) 13, latex beads 14, 15, noble-metal NPs 16, 17, carbon NPs 18, 19, colloidal selenium 20, and magnetic NPs 21. Notably, these material innovations have advanced the limit of detection (LOD) into the level of pg/mL (vs. ng/mL of conventional LFA) and significantly broadened the applications. High-quality and scalable manufacturing of these nanomaterials is required to translate these techniques from the laboratory experiments to clinical use. Other strategies using additional reagents like metallic enhancement 22, 23, enzyme-based catalytic reactions 24, 25, and a combination of them 26 also lead to remarkable LOD improvement but add complexity to the LFA operation.",

            "text": "An attractive strategy that amplifies signals based on the current LFA design has emerged in the last 5-10 years. The strategy mainly relies on the laser excitation of plasmonic gold NPs (GNPs) and the subsequently generated signal is much stronger than the color signal, resulting in the LOD enhancement. Note, GNPs are the most frequently used detection agents for in vitro diagnostics, especially in LFA. Like other plasmonic nanomaterials, GNPs feature a unique phenomenon called localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), making themselves ideal candidates in this revolution 27, 28. The LSPR comes from the strong interaction between light and GNPs, where the surface electrons of GNPs oscillate collectively with the electric field of light 29. It also leads to localized effects including enhanced electromagnetic field and eventually heating 30-32. Taken together, applying laser on the GNPs-based LFA provides a new route to benefit its analytical performance without modifying the current architecture and operation. There are several advantages to this approach. Firstly, it keeps the simplicity and rapidness of LFA and doesn't add complexity in performing the assay. Secondly, it offers additional sensing modes to the conventional LFA. The as-generated signals from GNPs can also serve as indicators to determine target concentration. Thirdly, a more sensitive and quantitative detection could be achieved by a laser-reader system. Reading the color signal by naked eyes, especially for weak color change, inevitably causes inconsistent result in LFA 2. With the assistance of a reader, robust and consistent results could be realized. Lastly, the laser-reader systems could potentially be miniaturized as handheld devices with all-in-one platform, which is highly desirable for POC diagnostics. To our knowledge, a review of this special topic on laser-induced signal amplification for GNPs-based LFA is not available and will provide intriguing insights from both scientific findings and clinical applications.",

In SERS-LFA, the assay operation is identical to that of a conventional LFA, except for the tags' preparation. In the work by Hwang et al. 37, Raman molecules and antibody-coated hollow GNPs were utilized as SERS tags for the LFA (Figure 2A). For the SERS signal readout, a completed LFA strip was scanned in a standard Raman microscope system for the measurement, where the SERS peak intensity of test band was monitored for quantitative analysis. Using staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) as a model, the authors performed SERS-LFA, conventional LFA, and ELISA for comparison. SEB is one of the bacterial superantigens secreted from Staphylococcus aureus that infects immune system profoundly and leads to a wide range of infectious diseases 38. The result shown in Figure 2B demonstrates that SERS increased detection range and improved LOD of LFA by 104-fold, and it was even 103-fold lower than that of ELISA. Particularly, for each strip characterization, a focused area (200 \u03bcm \u00d7 800 \u03bcm) of test band was used to collect the SERS signal, while the control band was tested for verification (see the inset in Figure 2B). Also, due to the uneven distribution of SERS signal on the test band, the average intensity of scanned regions was further used for the quantitative analysis. The concept of combining SERS with LFA for nucleic acids detection was also reported by the same group 39, and soon after that, this assay platform has been widely extended to different targets, including disease biomarkers 40 and pathogens 41.",

Also, the specific interaction (e.g., electron transfer) between the Raman molecules and the NPs allows further amplification of SERS signal 34. Meanwhile, the stability of Raman signals is another direction that requires carefully design of the SERS tags. For instance, NPs with high uniformity and protection layers enable evenly distributed signal and avoid the loss of Raman reporters, respectively 45, 46. Therefore, optimizing the shape and composition of the plasmonic NPs has great promise in the development of SERS-based diagnostics for the amplified and robust signal readouts.",

Specifically, SERS tags encoded with different Raman molecules are conjugated to the detection antibodies for multiple targets 47, 48. For example, Doering et al. demonstrated for the first time using Nanoplex Biotags (Au@SiO2 NPs, commercially available from Oxonica, Inc.) for the multiplexed detection of Flu A, Flu B, and respiratory syncytial virus on a standard LFA 36. However, combining multiple targets in one test band, the as-obtained SERS spectrum could show overlapped or close peaks and may impact on the sensitivity of LFA 49, 50. Arranging parallel test bands on the membrane could also achieve multiplexed detection, where each band associates to identify one of the targets 51. This inevitably increases the assay time and reduces the signal throughput 52. In addition, construction of microarray on LFA strips offers a promising solution to shorten the sample-to-answer time. For example, Zhang et al. demonstrated a multiplexed detection of respiratory tract infection pathogens (up to 11) by grouping two SERS tags and a 2\u00d73 microarray as test dots on the LFA 53. Collectively, further work could put more efforts in the nanostructure design, strip construction, and Raman reporter's selection for multiplexed detection on SERS-LFA.",

Taking advantage of the line focus of optical fiber probe, the laser illumination covers the entire width of strip and moves across step by step (0.1 s for each step and 50 steps per band), achieving 5 s acquisition time for the test band (4 mm \u00d7 0.8 mm) within an individual scan.

For example, Au@SiO2 core-shell NPs, hollow GNPs, Au-Ag core-satellite NPs have been used in the above-mentioned work 36, 37, 54. This could potentially lead to complexity and difficulty in SERS molecule encoding, antibody conjugation, and maintaining shelf stability. Secondly, the trade-off occurs between signal intensity and data acquisition settings. For instance, point scanning with long acquisition time favors for strong Raman signal. However, this compromises the working efficiency and only samples a limited fraction of the test band, which could lead to under-sampling and inconsistent results from test to test (i.e., low reproducibility). This issue also exists in some commercially available SERS readers (e.g., Snowy Range 'CBEx' Raman spectrometer, Laramie, USA) 55. In contrast, increasing sampling area and reducing acquisition time result in significantly inferior performance. For instance, Hwang et al. reported 104-fold improvement by point scanning part of the test band (200 \u03bcm \u00d7 800 \u03bcm) with long acquisition time (6 min), while Tran et al. reported 4-fold improvement by line scanning the whole test band (4 mm \u00d7 0.8 mm) with short acquisition time (5 s). In addition, the line scanning requires more powerful laser (120 mW) compared with the point-scanning Raman microscope system (3 mW).",

Essentially, a completed LFA strip was irradiated with a 532 nm laser (power = 0.01 W) to activate the GNPs and the thermal contrast signal was recorded by an IR camera (Figure 3A). The thermal analysis of test band gave quantitative results as a function of the GNP concentrations. The analytical performance of FDA-approved LFA strips for detecting cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) was evaluated through the thermal contrast signal. CrAg testing is urgently required for cryptococcal meningitis diagnosis, especially in immunocompromised adults 62. Figure 3B shows the TCA produced a 32-fold enhancement in the detection sensitivity and extended detection dynamic range over the visual detection. Note the blue arrow marks the high dose \u201chook\u201d effect with decreased visual and thermal intensity, which can be addressed by diluting the target sample or engineering the format of strip 6. The TCA technique was further validated in clinical cerebral spinal fluid samples with known CrAg titers from patients with and without cryptococcal meningitis. Recently, clinical cohort study was performed using the commercial CrAg LFA kits (Immy, Inc., USA) assisted with TCA technique 63.",

Changing the spherical GNPs into gold nanorods (GNRs) or gold nanoshells (GNSs) could largely increase the Cabs per particle volume 64. As a result, under same condition (i.e., particle concentration and laser power), GNRs produce about 10-fold more heat than the spherical GNPs and GNSs when normalized against the particle volume. Moreover, when combined with low-absorbing substrates as the backing materials (e.g., glass and plastic) and higher laser power (i.e., 0.01 W to 1 W), GNRs-based TCA-LFA could have the potential to achieve 104-fold improvement over the visual LOD of LFA 61. In addition, Hu et al. reported employing gold nanocages with superior photothermal conversion efficiency as detection agents for TCA-LFA, where a 6-fold enhancement of the LOD has been achieved compared with the visual LFA 65. Zhan et al. also studied the size impact of GNPs on the sensitivity of LFA 66. Importantly, the size of GNPs not only affects their optical and thermal properties, but also influences the migration speed and antibody binding events within the membrane. By modelling these key parameters (i.e., size and concentration of GNPs, migration rates, binding reaction, and diffusion), Zhan et al. found that larger GNPs could improve the assay performance due to more antibodies on the surface (favoring the binding reaction) and size-dependent properties (larger size resulting in stronger signal generation). For example, 100 nm GNPs yield a 256-fold sensitivity enhancement under the TCA detection mode compared to the colorimetric signal of 30 nm GNP-based LFA. However, even larger GNPs (e.g., 400 nm) would have difficulties in migrating across the strip due to the slower diffusion rates. This inevitably decreases GNP capture and thus the LFA sensitivity. Similar investigation of size impact on the LOD of LFA has also been reported by Loynachan et al. 17.",

The initial detection system reported in 61 is only available in a research lab (i.e., a large laser system on an optical table) with manual control and a simple reading algorithm. In a follow-up study, the same group developed a benchtop TCA reader prototype (46 cm \u00d7 34 cm \u00d7 34 cm size, 11.7 kg weight, Figure 3C) that is low-cost and compact with automatic data acquisition and analysis 67. The overall design of the laser-reader system was shown in Figure 3D. In the benchtop device, a continuous wave (CW) laser was employed, of which the cost was significantly reduced but the performance was comparable to the original research laser (Spectra-Physics, Millennia Vs) under the same output power. Other improvements over the research system include automation of a stepper motor and an optical shutter through LabVIEW, as well as the LFA-holding cassettes that could align LFA strips of different sizes and geometries under the laser for reproducible reading. However, the IR camera with software for signal reading and data analysis wasn't changed due to the requirement of spatial resolution and user interface. Based on this benchtop device, a two-stage algorithm was used (Figure 3E): 1) the temperature rise was obtained by capturing multiple points (vs. single point in previous work 61) of test band subtracting the background temperature rise (outside test band); 2) area under curve (AUC) analysis of the TCA signal pattern was performed for the data reduction and quantitative results. The development of a handheld and portable device for TCA was conceptualized and initial assessment on the individual reader components such as a portable laser and a cheaper IR sensor was performed. Further work has been undergoing to build and test a POC device based on the TCA technique.",

In a recent work, Ojaghi et al. developed a long-wave infrared TPLI system for the thermal interpretation of LFA strips 71. As shown in Figure 4A, the working scheme was to use a laser to first excite the region of interest (ROI) covering both control and test bands for the generation of thermal waves (i.e., Planck radiation), which was subsequently detected by an IR camera. Due to the spatial distribution of GNPs at various layers of the membrane, the diffusive thermal field was altered and resulted in a depth-integrated signal. Therefore, a phase shift was formed when the inner thermal wave reached the surface and contributed to the thermal radiation. Simultaneously, amplitude change of the radiometric signal was induced by the subsurface absorption of light that can also be used to quantify the concentration of GNPs and the analyte.",

The as-obtained TP signal was then proceeded via a standard quadrature demodulation/ lock-in analysis to decipher amplitude and phase information. Typical TP phase and amplitude images of LFA strip were shown in Figure 4D at 2 Hz of laser frequency, where the control and test bands and the adjacent background (red box) can be resolved. Due to the different number of GNPs accumulated in those three regions, the corresponding thermal contrast could be observed in both images. Therefore, the variation of contrast in the test bands from different strips was used to correlate with the concentration of GNPs and analyte. Under the optimized modulation frequency (2 Hz), the average normalized phase signal decreases quantitatively as a function of hCG concentration (Figure 4E). Statistically, 0.2 mIU hCG in LFA could be detected through TPLI technique, while only 2 mIU hCG was reached by visual interpretation or optical reader.

This intensity-fluctuation profile, through a simple Fourier transformation, enables statistical calculation and mapping of species dynamics 74. Collectively, many applications have been proposed and implemented in the fields of neuroscience, dermatology, and ophthalmology 75-77.

            "text": "Song et al. have recently demonstrated the use of PT-LSI for LFA 79. Due to the multiple layered structure of LFA strips, the probe light scatters randomly and forms speckle patterns. The working principle, as shown in Figure 5A, takes advantages of a PT laser with 532 nm beam to specifically excite the GNPs on membrane. As a consequence, the GNPs generate heat and change the speckle pattern of LFA membrane by the scattered light of 780 nm probe laser. Instead of using IR camera as the sensor, the speckle pattern change was monitored by an optical sensor (i.e., CMOS camera), which reduces cost compared with IR cameras. An optical chopper is employed to modulate the intensity of PT light to minimize external noise, such as laser intensity variation. The excited GNPs generate heat that alters the refractive index and causes thermal deformation of the membrane, resulting in the speckle pattern change. This change is associated with the number of GNPs reside, which can be used to quantify the target concentration. A custom-built program implemented in MATLAB was designed to process the PT-LSI signal. The analytical procedure is outlined in Figure 5B (top to bottom). Firstly, the pixel intensity of each PT-LSI image obtained at different time periods is characterized by a fluctuation at the same frequency of the PT light modulation. Note, the presence of GNPs gives a much stronger signal than the background signal from LFA membrane. Secondly, the intensity fluctuation profile is Fourier transformed into magnitude as a function of frequency, which is further mapped into a PT-LSI image based on the corresponding pixels. Lastly, the averaged PT-LSI signals, referred to as \u201cPT-LSI output\u201d over the ROI (i.e., control and test bands), quantify the concentration of GNPs and analytes. As evidenced in Figure 5C and D, the PT-LSI result showed enhanced analytical performance over the colorimetric signal in quantifying the concentration of GNPs solution and CrAg sample. The LOD of the PT-LSI coupled LFA was 125- fold and 68-fold lower than that of the colorimetric LFA for detecting GNP and CrAg, respectively.",

As a result, the PA signal increases with the absorbed energy and indicates the optical absorption of a sample. In addition, the PA imaging has deeper penetration due to the ultrasound transmission and sensitive detection, compared with limited light penetration in optical imaging 83.

            "text": "Zhao et al. first explored the combination of PA technique with LFA 85. Figure 6A shows that, when illuminated by a CW laser beam, the GNPs captured within test/control bands generate PA signal due to the thermal expansion of the adjacent air. Meanwhile, the different density of GNPs at the test band leads to the amplitude change of PA signal, which indicates the analyte concentration. To ensure the precise and quantitative measurements, the LFA strip was enclosed in a small-volume and air-tight chamber with minimized vibration from the environment and the strip itself (see Figure 6B). Also, two detection modes were developed, where the \u201cchop mode\u201d employed an optical chopper to modulate the laser intensity and the \u201cscan mode\u201d used a rotating polygonal mirror for the scanning across the ROI. Notably, the peak-to-peak value of the signals (Figure 6C and D) was marked as the PA signal amplitude and further used to calculate the analyte concentration. Due to the adsorption of light by the strip itself, a strong background signal was observed in the \u201cchop mode\u201d (blue trace in Figure 6C), while in the \u201cscan mode\u201d, the background signal was reduced (blue trace in Figure 6D). This is because, without chopping the laser, the LFA strip absorbs a constant amount of the excitation light during the scan and the laser stimulation generates a GNP-specific signal when scanning across the test band. Using CrAg LFA kits as an example, PA method could significantly enhance the sensitivity over the colorimetric detection. Figure 6E shows the dose-response curves of the colorimetric analysis, chop mode, and scan mode of PA detections, giving LOD of 1.1 ng\u00b7mL-1, 0.57 ng\u00b7mL-1, and 0.010 ng\u00b7mL-1, respectively. These results clearly demonstrated that the PA technique offers a powerful means to amplify the signal, enabling a more sensitive (110-fold enhancement) and quantitative analysis for LFA.",

Different reader systems including hardware (e.g., laser source and detector) and software (e.g., signal acquisition and data proceeding) have been introduced for each technique implementation. Compared with the colorimetric readouts of LFA, those techniques show improved analytical performance upon the sensing of analytes. Promising as they are in this technological development, we are expecting to witness more competing products in the coming decade.",

            "text": "These signal amplification strategies are more straightforward than the colorimetric enhancement strategies since the latter one requires specifically designed detection agents (e.g., enzymes coated GNPs) or additional reagents for improved signal readouts. As clearly illustrated from the above- mentioned examples, the laser-assisted techniques detect the signal from a completed strip without extra assay operation and can be readily implemented on commercially available LFA kits. However, there are several limitations: 1) for SERS-LFA, it suffers from the high assay expenses and special SERS tags preparation; 2) for the photothermal-related detection, the bulky instrumentation needs to be further improved with lower-cost components; 3) clinical assessment is also highly demanded to evaluate the enhanced sensitivity versus the likelihood of false-positives for all techniques; and 4) the point-focus scanning (e.g., TCA and PA methods) needs to be optimized for rapid and robust readouts. The comparison of each method viewed from other aspects has been summarized in Table 1.",

            "text": "With these developments for LFA signal enhancement, we envision that diagnostic performance of an assay is one of several critical parameters towards practical applications. Particularly, minimizing non-specific binding and increasing specific binding at test bands of LFA strips are the key to reduce background signals and interpret accurate results at low target concentrations (vs. false positives). Other factors such as the optimization of whole detection system, including signal generation, miniaturization, cost, operation time, automation, and data analysis, should also be considered from the POC perspective 87. Toward this end, the development of devices may be divided into three stages: 1) initiate research study to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating new detection techniques on LFA strips and the research outcomes could serve as a guideline to develop portable systems; 2) prototype a benchtop system consisting of lower-cost and smaller components, which offers on-demand tests and can be installed in hospitals or central referral laboratories; and 3) develop a handheld system that can be used in a wide range of environmental settings and fulfill the need of on-site decision making with high sensitivity. Such device development is an important step to translate the innovation from benchtop to bedside 88. Licensing techniques from academic institutions to startup companies or incubators can further translate these findings into the clinics yet remains another challenge (i.e., \u201cvalley of death\u201d 89). As a good reference, the development of fluorescence- based LFA directs a pathway for the researchers who are interested to pursue further clinical translation, such as LFA manufacturing, fluorescence label design, and instrument optimization. For example, the deployment of upconverting NPs in LFA reduces the background signal from the strip 90; and there are many commercially available fluorescence readers in the market.",

            "text": "For future POC diagnostics, the highly flexible formats of LFA allow further integration of novel materials and techniques. For instance, GNPs with varied shapes and structures provide a simple yet efficient way for the sensitivity and accuracy improvement of the LFA, while it's now feasible to prepare them in a controlled manner 91, 92. It is promising to apply them into LFA for new signal-transducer principles and substantial signal enhancement. While for the size-dependent signal transduction, its response usually increases with the GNPs size. However, the membrane structure of LFA strips traps the large particles, and it leaves the assay incomplete. Therefore, rather than enlarging the size of GNPs for stronger signals, the priority should be put in choosing NPs with proper size without difficulties in completing the assay. Also, the multiplexing of LFAs is a critical area for the development of the POC diagnostics. In this case, the creation of pads or other platforms and efficient conjugation events will be of great importance 3, 93, 94. Microfluidic platforms that are able to precisely manipulate the flow rate of sample and the migration of probes and targets allow for high-throughput screening applications. There will be some potential opportunities to combine the advantage of these two platforms 95, 96. Smartphone has been developed as a platform for POC diagnostics in recent years, offering great opportunities for delivering healthcare to resource-limited settings due to its availability 97. The integrated components (e.g., camera, chips, and add-on thermal camera from FLIR\u00ae) of smartphone are extremely suitable for signal enhancement and detection of LFA 98-100. While not a focus in this paper, enhancing the optical signal of GNPs in LFA by increasing the probe density around the analytes like self-assembly and aggregation has been well documented in recent papers 101-103. Ultimately, we hope that this article can be a valuable source to the communities in academia and industry for future work in this important and emerging field.",
