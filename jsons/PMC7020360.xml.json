            "text": "Immunization is one of the most beneficial and cost-effective disease prevention measures. There are global efforts to develop new vaccines for the control of diseases of global health importance. Africa has not featured prominently on the world\u2019s vaccine clinical trial landscape [1] despite being the second most populated continent, and alongside Asia, the hub of most infectious diseases [2, 3]. As of September 24, 2018, a snapshot of total registered vaccine clinical trials on the US National Institute of Health (NIH) Library of Medicine\u2019s portal revealed 6677 ongoing vaccine clinical trials across the world with only 347 (~ 5%) taking place in Africa. However, there is a disproportional distribution of vaccine trials on the African continent with approximately a third of these vaccine trials attributable to the Republic of South Africa (RSA). West Africa, including all Lassa fever (LF)-affected countries, contributed 35% (121) of Africa\u2019s vaccine trials; however, most of these trials (~ 83%) occurred in Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Gambia, and Senegal. Out of the 8 Lassa-affected countries, the three worst-hit (Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and Liberia) account for only 12% of vaccine trials in West Africa, further underlining the gap and inequity in the distribution of this critical component of Research and Development (R&D) [4]. It should also be noted that only 22% of these studies were phase I trials with the majority being phase II, III, and post-vaccine introduction effectiveness studies [4].",

            "text": "Clinical research demands careful consideration of ethical, scientific, methodological, and operational aspects of each study [5]. Many factors play a role in the appropriateness of site selection for sponsored multi-center clinical studies. These include having access to patients meeting the eligibility criteria, expertise in the outcome (disease) of interest, presence of facilities or equipment, and trained investigators willing and able to perform the research. Also, previous experience with clinical trials, especially involving vaccines, is a useful indicator of successful clinical trial management. Other factors include having the required equipment, personnel, and procedures to handle the investigational product (IP). Familiarity with trial procedures, e.g., contracting, informed consent process, and submissions to ethical and regulatory authorities, is also an important consideration. Of recent, a significant number of clinical trials are experiencing delays due to many factors, the majority of which are associated with the appropriateness of the clinical trial site and challenges with patient recruitment [5\u20137]. The inability to recruit enough study subjects increases the length of the enrollment period with the attendant increase in operational cost. The time and cost of maintaining a site between and during clinical trials could gulp a considerable amount of funds, which under-performing sites would not be able to justify. Also, sites with inexperienced or unskilled investigators are more likely to incur protocol infractions or to have low-quality data that will require further training, on-site visits, and more queries for clarification, all of which impacts costs and study duration [7].",

A reduction in time and cost of conducting a clinical trial has become more critical as competition to bring new drugs and vaccines to the market is increasing. These challenges have prompted most sponsors to look towards conducting clinical trials in developing countries of Asia, Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa [6]. These regions are under-represented in research, yet these populations stand to gain more from research as their infectious diseases\u2019 burden and the need for effective vaccines is higher than that of developed countries. Conducting clinical trials in Africa is deemed challenging because of perceived problems with getting valid informed consent, ethical compensation mechanisms for indigent populations, poor health infrastructure, and considerable socio-economic and cultural divides. However, these countries could also offer an attractive setting for clinical trials [8]. Conducting clinical trials in sub-Sahara Africa promotes access to innovative medical countermeasures and enhances the research capacities of scientists in these countries [9]. Importantly, clinical trials need to be responsive to the needs of host communities. Based on the high prevalence of Lassa fever in West Africa, it is important to conduct the clinical trials within the setting to allow for an assessment of the potential impact of factors such as disease epidemiology, health service needs, social determinants of health, presence of comorbidities, compliance, and genetic make-up on the efficacy and effectiveness of the eventual vaccine [10]. This also ensures that recommendations of the use of Lassa virus (LASV) vaccine in these countries are based on appropriate benefit-risk assessments especially because available evidence suggests that differences might exist in the rate of enzyme-mediated metabolism of drugs and biologics between different populations based on genetic mutations [11].",

Conducting clinical trials requires the presence of experienced researchers and sites capable of carrying out high-level, good clinical practice (GCP) compliant scientific trials. Site selection should also be supported by current epidemiological data on the target disease. A lot of the required information remains unknown for the LF-affected countries. Choosing the right site can save time, money, and ultimately lives. Therefore, this study is aimed at determining the presence and preparedness of research sites in LF-affected countries to host a successful LF vaccine clinical trial. In this study, we reviewed the literature to determine the vaccine clinical trial landscape in West Africa, mapped the potential clinical research sites in LF-affected countries, and developed a scorecard for the assessment and operational characterization of the mapped sites. The findings from this study could serve as a guide to vaccine developers who may lack experience in conducting clinical trials in West Africa. It can also serve as a useful resource for organizations committed to developing research capacity in the sub-region.",

The questionnaire was an adapted version of a pretested and validated site readiness checklist for vaccine trials obtained from the global health training network web resources [12]. The checklist template was edited to include questions pertinent to the conduct of LASV vaccine clinical trials. These inquiries include physical accessibility of the research site, presence of infrastructures for LF diagnosis, site\u2019s experience with conducting clinical trials, research output or publications, and access to facilities for the storage of biological samples. Also, a specific sub-section on X-rays was removed in favor of questions aimed at determining the overall clinical care ability of sites. The adapted questionnaire was pretested by sending to 12 research sites in West Africa with 3 sites (1 each) from Senegal, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, and Niger responding. The only adjustment made after the pilot was to increase the space for listing research outputs or publications emanating from research activities carried out at the sites. The questionnaires were sent out as emails with an active hyperlink to the mapped sites in LF-affected countries. The questionnaire was also shared on social media outlets like Twitter and LinkedIn to ensure a wider audience was reached. This was also to provide opportunities for sites that might have been missed in the mapping exercise to respond. Each research site was given 3 weeks to respond to the questionnaire.",

The questions sought information on four broad categories based on the WHO/TDR competency wheel [13]: these include scientific thinking, ethics, quality/risk management, study and site(s) management, and research operations. A quantitative score was allocated to each question in an empirical, but systematic fashion based on the lead author\u2019s experience and perceived importance of the question to the conduct of LF vaccine clinical trials. The score was calculated in Excel using \u201cif-conditions\u201d in the formulas, e.g., if the question \u201cIs the site accessible by road?\u201d was answered with \u201cYes,\u201d the score column was automatically set to 1, any other answer led to \u201cNo.\u201d The more answers that were possible, the more nesting for the if-conditions that were necessary. For the others, multiplying or dividing factors were used as appropriate, e. g., a previous history of successful conduct of vaccine clinical trial carried twice the score of a previous drug clinical trial. The total number of staff per site was divided by a factor of 2 (up to 32 staff) to give a maximum score of 16. Also, having the ability to conduct nucleic acid-based diagnosis (PCR) attracted a score of 10 due to its importance to LF diagnosis. Analysis of the quantitative data and calculation of the scores per site were done using a Microsoft Excel-based template aimed at categorizing the trial sites based on their score over a defined total maximum score of 100. Prior to receiving the responses from the sites, it was predetermined that sites with scores \u2265 75% would be categorized as \u201cA\u201d sites, 50\u201374% as \u201cB\u201d sites, and < 50% as \u201cC\u201d sites, while non-responding sites or sites that declined participation will be categorized as \u201cD\u201d sites. The 75% threshold was based on the minimum score possible for any site with facilities, personnel, and processes deemed necessary by the authors for the conduct of LASV vaccine clinical trials as displayed in Table 1.\n",

Also, the scorecard is yet to be validated; hence, we cannot be definite that a high score means that a site will be successful. Finally, some of the sites interpreted the question on history of clinical trials to basically refer to any study that utilizes a randomized clinical trial method irrespective of whether they were meant to evaluate an investigational product or not.",

            "text": "A vaccine is urgently needed to prevent LF disease outbreaks, and its development should be a priority. While developing vaccine candidates requires significant financial investment in R&D, testing the vaccines in human populations requires the presence of research sites with human resources, facilities, and processes capable of conducting high-quality clinical trials. The results of this site survey indicated that most of the clinical trial sites were willing to perform vaccine trials in the future, provided capacity gaps can be addressed. Most of the identified gaps were within the purview of clinical and laboratory infrastructures, experience with sponsored vaccines and drug clinical trials, and investigational product handling. Partnership with pharmaceutical companies and relevant non-profit sector players is necessary to address these gaps. This experience with a systematic and comparative method of site assessment is encouraging, and the site selection method used can serve as guidance with points to consider for sponsors and researchers planning clinical trials. Site visits are ongoing to confirm the results of this survey. Until this process is complete, it may be difficult to conclude that the scorecard successfully predict which site could successfully hold vaccine trials. Further studies and publications are required to compare the data collected online with those obtained from actual site visits as well as to improve on the context of the questionnaire tool to improve its ability to gather more in-depth information as specified in the WHO/TDR competency wheel for clinical trials.",
