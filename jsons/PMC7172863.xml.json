            "text": "\nCryptosporidium is one of the most common enteropathogens present in calves during their first two weeks of age (Thompson et al., 2007). Young calves mainly shed Cryptosporidium parvum, which has a wide host range and is potentially zoonotic. Clinical infection in calves is characterized by non-specific diarrhea, dehydration, depression, anorexia and abdominal pain. In most calves, diarrhea starts 3\u20135 days postinfection and lasts from 4 to 17 days (de Graaf et al., 1999). Oocyst shedding begins at 4 days after birth and peaks at 7\u201318 days, decreasing after 3 weeks (Nydam et al., 2001, Trotz-Williams et al., 2007). Higher oocyst shedding is frequently seen during episodes of diarrhea (Xiao and Herd, 1994, McCluskey et al., 1995). Despite much endeavor in the development of effective drugs, halofuginone lactate (HL) is the only drug registered in Europe to treat cryptosporidiosis in cattle. HL can reduce, but not completely prevent, oocyst shedding and diarrhea in calves (Joachim et al., 2003), suggesting that additional hygiene measures must be adopted to provide better control of Cryptosporidium infections (de Waele et al., 2010). Other enteric viral and bacterial pathogens such as rotaviruses, coronaviruses and Escherichia coli can also cause diarrhea in bovine neonates to the same degree of severity as cryptosporidiosis (de Graaf et al., 1999).",

            "text": "Cryptosporidiosis is a multifactorial disease in which many parameters associated with calves, and environment and production practices, may be of significance. Previous studies have indicated that cryptosporidiosis may occur more frequently in dairy calves than in beef calves because the former are born throughout the year and are confined to pens or hutches, which can facilitate a high level of year-round transmission (Olson et al., 2004). Other factors linked to passive immunity of the calf and management of large herds may also be relevant (O\u2019Handley, 2007). Several factors have been identified as significant in increasing the risk of shedding Cryptosporidium oocysts by dairy calves. Most studies have focused on factors associated with management of the herd, and attempted to resolve these issues by presenting a questionnaire to farmers (e.g., Garber et al., 1994, Mohammed et al., 1999, Trotz-Williams et al., 2007, Silverl\u00e5s et al., 2009b). Significant risk factors may differ from survey to survey, indicating that different epidemiological practices may need to be adopted on different farms. Epidemiological data for dairy calf cryptosporidiosis in France is scarce, and there are no risk factor analysis. The first surveys in France underlined the importance of Cryptosporidium in neonatal diarrhea and reported that the prevalence of oocyst shedding ranged from 17.9% to 43.4%, depending on the sampling regime (Naciri et al., 1999, Lefay et al., 2000). Molecular characterization of Cryptosporidium isolates shed by dairy calves identified the zoonotic C. parvum as the dominant species, followed by C. bovis and C. ryanae (Follet et al., 2011, Rieux et al., 2013).",

A plausible explanation could be that the walls of the buckets are highly contaminated by oocysts, which could occur when farmers stack them for storage. These oocysts are probably not removed by standard washing procedures and may contaminate subsequent food placed in the buckets. An alternative explanation could be the failure to satisfy the calves\u2019 need for suckling in those that are quickly separated from their dams and fed using buckets without teats. This separation may lead calves to suckle another calf (cross-suckling), or other points in their housing area or environment, thereby ingesting oocysts that cause early and repeated infection. A study investigating the effect of teat feeding on cross-suckling in dairy calves reported that teat feeding reduces cross-suckling compared to calves fed from buckets (Jensen and Budde, 2006). Finally, teat feeding allows a more effective reflex closure of the esophageal groove than feeding from the bucket, which probably prevents fermentation and limits colonization by enteropathogens such as C. parvum (Ferran and Bouquet, 2013). This notion is supported by the findings of a German study of 249 calves (<14 days old) suffering from acute enteritis, where the esophageal groove did not close in 11.2% of cases (Dirr and Dirksen, 1989).",

Supplementation of feed with Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus reuteri in mice and rats reduces fecal shedding of C. parvum oocysts (Alak et al., 1999, Guitard et al., 2006). Another study reported that the oral administration of fermented milk supplemented with two probiotic strains significantly increased delayed-type hypersensitivity, plaque-forming cells and half-hemolysis values in healthy adult mice. Synbiotic fermented milk may help improve intestinal health and have a positive effect on the humoral and cell-mediated immunity of host animals (Wang et al., 2012). Similarly, lactic acid bacteria isolated from the calf gut inhibit those causing diarrhea in calves (Maldonado et al., 2012). However, no differences were reported in the incidence of diarrhea and Cryptosporidium oocyst shedding in calves receiving probiotic treatment with lactic acid-producing bacteria under field conditions (Harp et al., 1996).",

Contrastingly, others have reported a higher incidence of calf diarrhea during the winter in North America (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986, Curtis et al., 1988, Frank and Kaneene, 1993). Absence of a seasonal effect in our study may be due to the mild oceanic climate of Normandy characterized by low thermal amplitude, allowing oocysts to survive and overwinter in a more conducive environment that allows them to challenge calves all year round.",
