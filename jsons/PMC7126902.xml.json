            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, including pigs, sheep, cattle, and many types of wild animals (De Diego et al., 1997). FMD outbreaks have caused significant economic loss and posed threats to international trade and commerce in many countries, such as those in the 2001 outbreak in UK, the 1997 outbreak in Taiwan, and the 2013 outbreak in China (Li et al., 2008, Longjam et al., 2011, Zheng et al., 2013). FMD is characterized by fever, languidity, and vesicular lesions on the tongue, feet, snout, and teats. This disease causes high morbidity but low mortality in adult animals (Alexandersen et al., 2003, Grubman, 2005, S\u00f8rensen et al., 1998). The disease is caused by the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) belonging to the genus Aphthovirus and the family Picornaviridae (D\u00edaz-San Segundo et al., 2011, Mason et al., 1997, Perez-Martin et al., 2012). The virus consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 8.5 kb (Sobrino et al., 2001). Thus far, seven serotypes of the virus, namely, A, O, Asia1, C, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3 (Reid et al., 2002), have been identified. About 60\u201370% homology exists among these seven serotypes, and little cross-protection is found among different serotypes and even among different subtypes (Dias et al., 2011, Bates et al., 2003, Mayr et al., 2001, Reid et al., 2002, S\u00f8rensen et al., 1998). For this reason, this disease is regarded as the most infectious swine disease by the OIE.",

Furthermore, chemically inactivated vaccines have shown limited efficacy in preventing the spread of the disease, because effective immunity is usually achieved in five to seven days after administration of the active vaccine (Grubman, 2005). Prior to this period, animals remain susceptible to FMDV infection. Furthermore, vaccine development usually lags behind the appearance of new FMDV strains (Zheng et al., 2013). However, FMD outbreaks continue to occur in many countries and suggest that FMD eradication may be virtually impossible. These attributes greatly challenge the control of FMD (Alexandersen et al., 2003, Paton et al., 2005). Therefore, there is a dire need to develop more effective strategies to combat FMD (Grubman, 2005, Hunter et al., 2005, Laible, 2009).",

            "text": "Interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are produced by interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (Diamond and Farzan, 2012). IFITMs play significant roles in the antiviral activities of type I and II interferons (Brass et al., 2009). Many viruses can be restricted by IFITMs including influenza A virus (IAV), Ebola virus, Marburg virus, SARS coronavirus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus (WNV) (Diamond and Farzan, 2012, Feeley et al., 2011, Mehle and Doudna, 2010, Yao et al., 2011). However, IFITMs did not affect the replication of murine leukemia virus, Machupo virus, Lassa virus, or lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Perreira et al., 2013). IFITM3, a member of the IFITM family, inhibits the viral life cycles of IAV, WNV, dengue virus, and FMDV in early stages in vitro (Brass et al., 2009, Perreira et al., 2013). Our previous study showed that swine IFITM3 can prevent the replication of FMDV in BHK-21 cells and in mice (Xu et al., 2014). In theory, overexpression of the IFITM3 protein may control FMDV infection and spread in pigs. However, studies on the overexpression of IFITM3 in vivo or the production of an IFITM3-transgenic (TG) model are yet to be conducted. Here, we generated swine IFITM3 (sIFITM3)-TG pigs and evaluated their susceptibility to FMDV infection.",

This technology involves the stable introduction of exogenous genes, such as antiviral genes, into livestock genomes (Hunter et al., 2005, Laible, 2009). Different TG technologies substantially contribute to disease control. The Mx protein has a wide spectrum of antiviral activities against many RNA and DNA viruses (Haller and Kochs, 2011, Haller et al., 2007, Schusser et al., 2011). The Mx-TG mice have been generated in various laboratories, and related research results have demonstrated their antiviral activity against the influenza virus isolated from the influenza pandemic in 1918 (Salomon et al., 2007, Tumpey et al., 2007). Another gene, swine nenectin-1, identified as the receptor gene of PRV, can restrict herpes simplex virus growth after its overexpression in cells in vitro (Ono et al., 2004b). Furthermore, nenectin-1-TG mouse has been reported to hinder PRV infection in vivo (Ono et al., 2004a). Similarly, in our previous study, we found that sIFITM3 blocked the progress of FMDV infection at the early stages of the virus\u2019 life cycle. Many studies have shown that IFITM3 exhibits a wide array of antiviral activities against many RNA viruses such as the Ebola virus, WNV, dengue virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV-1, and others (Diamond and Farzan, 2012). In addition, IFITM3-knockout mice have been found to show greater susceptibility to IAV than wild-type mice (Everitt et al., 2013), while IFITM3 has been reported to restrict the development of respiratory syncytial viruses in vivo (Everitt et al., 2013). To our knowledge, the current study is the first to create a IFITM3-TG model.",

The levels of sIFITM3 transcription and expression in specific tissues were compared between the TG and WT groups. Upregulation of transcription and expression of sIFITM3 was most substantial in the heart of the TG pigs. By contrast, no obvious difference in expression was observed between the lungs of the two groups. In the F2 generation, positive sIFITM3-TG pigs were identified by PCR and RT-PCR. Four healthy sIFITM3-TG pigs (F2 generation) and four healthy WT pigs were chosen for subsequent animal experiments. These pigs had similar weights and ages. They were challenged with 50 PID50 FMD O types (O/ES/2001) to test whether sIFITM3 conferred protection against FMDV to the TG pigs.",

In our previous studies, overexpression of IFITM3 significantly inhibited FMDV infection in BHK-21 cells. Importantly, the plasmid expressing sIFITM3 conferred 60% protection against FMDV in mice. However, sIFITM3-TG pigs were found to be unprotected against FMDV infection in this study. One possible explanation is that the sIFITM3 gene inserts randomly into the genome and disrupts the gene at the insertion site. Another possible explanation is that constitutive expression of the sIFITM3 gene might affect the function of other ISG genes. Based on our results, we propose that a combination of interferons and vaccines be used to control FMDV infection and avoid FMD outbreak.",
