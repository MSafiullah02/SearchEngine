            "text": "Human bocavirus (HBOV) was first described in 2005 by Allender et al. [2005] in the nasopharyngeal aspirates of children with respiratory infection. So far, it has been frequently associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in many reports worldwide with a frequency ranging from 2.2% to 19% [Allander et al., 2007; Canducci et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2014]. Its role as an etiologic agent in respiratory infections has been supported by significant associations between HBOV detection and concurrent otherwise unexplained diseases and also significantly higher detection of the virus in symptomatic patients compared to asymptomatic ones [Kesebir et al., 2006; Brieu et al., 2008; Ghietto et al., 2015]. On the other hand, HBOV has also been associated with encephalitis recently [Mitui et al., 2012; Mori et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013]. It has been postulated that if HBOV is able to cause viremia it can also disseminate to other parts of body [Allander et al., 2007]. Therefore, researchers investigated the presence of HBOV in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the children presented with a clinical picture of encephalitis and detected HBOV in 3\u201315% of these patients [Mitui et al., 2012; Mori et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013]. In this retrospective study, clinical features of HBOV infected children admitted to pediatric emergency room of a tertiary referral center with signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection are presented, with a special interest on a subgroup of patients complicated with unexplained encephalopathy during their disease period.",

They found no difference between HBOV single infection and co\u2010infection in terms of clinical and laboratory findings, similar to the current study. Another similar finding was reported by Brieu et al. [2008] who showed lack of difference in severity between children co\u2010infected with HBOV and RSV and those infected with RSV alone. A much higher co\u2010detection rate of HBOV (78.1%) was reported in a recent study from Argentina [Ghietto et al., 2015]. They also stated that clinical features of patients with HBoV\u2010single infection were not significantly different from those with co\u2010infection. In the current study, the majority of co\u2010infections of HBOV occurred with RSV, similar to some other reports in the literature [Wang et al., 2010; Ghietto et al., 2015].

All patients were ordered a chest X ray and only one\u2010third of chest X rays were normal. High rate of radiological investigation may be explained by relatively young age of the patients and presence of an underlying disease in most of them. Comorbidity was detected in 60% of our study group. It was associated with increased severity of the clinical picture caused by HBOV. However, in a recent study, comorbidity was found to be present in 31% of HBOV infected patients and no difference other than age of patients with comorbidities, which were older than previously healthy ones, was reported [Ghietto et al., 2015]. Recurrent wheezing was the most common preexisting medical condition in our patients (30%), and one patient had a history of asthma. This finding supports some studies in the literature, one of which reported a significantly high rate of preexisting wheezing and asthma episode in patients infected with HBOV, compared to HMPV and RSV [Brieu et al., 2008; Ghietto et al., 2015].",

Generally, a mild to moderate leucocytosis and increase in CRP were reported in several studies, as in this study [V\u00f6lz et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2014]. When differential blood counts were analyzed, it was noticed that neutrophilia and lymphopenia was significantly increasing as disease severity increases. Thus, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, a convenient marker of systemic inflammation, was significantly higher in patients admitted to pediatric wards and PICU. On the other hand, eosinophil counts were significantly decreased in hospitalized patients compared to outpatients. These findings are noteworthy, but we do not think that they are specific to HBOV infection, since their relation to increased disease severity was established for other diseases as well [Zahorec, 2001; Abidi et al., 2008].",

            "text": "HBOV is associated with respiratory disease in vast majority of reports. Its association with encephalitis has been shown only by three reports [Mitui et al., 2012; Mori et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013]. Researchers investigated the presence of HBOV genome in CSF samples of children with signs and symptoms of encephalitis. They found HBOV in 3%, 5.8% and 15% (number of patients: 191, 69, and 67, respectively) of patients with encephalopathy. HBOV viremia have been documented previously [Allander et al., 2007]. Mitui et al. [2012] detected HBOV genome also in the serum of one study patient. They found that the sequence of the HBOV detected in CSF and the corresponding serum were similar. This finding may indicate that HBOV encephalitis was caused by hematogenous route of the virus [Mitui et al., 2012]. However, the disruption mechanism of blood\u2013brain barrier is to be determined. It is currently not known that whether HBOV dissemination to the central nervous system is related to host immunological factors, or associated with viral mutations leading to altered cell tropism or pathogenesis [Mitui et al., 2012]. CSF pleocytosis and abnormal protein/glucose levels are not common findings in all three studies evaluating HBOV encephalitis [Mitui et al., 2012; Mori et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013]. Although normal or near\u2010normal CSF findings may be expected in viral encephalitis, it may be argued that an impaired inflammatory response related to host may exist. Mitui et al. [2012] linked this issue to the malnourished condition of their study group. However, other studies have also reported HBOV encephalitis in well nourished children [Mori et al., 2013]. So, there may be other host related immunological impairments, unknown currently. In our study group, patients were admitted to hospital with respiratory sypmtoms. On admission, no signs and symptoms related to encephalopathy were present. However, in four patients, who were admitted to PICU because of severe respiratory disease, a clinical picture of encephalopathy characterized by seizures and decreased consciousness developed within first 2\u20133 days of PICU admission. We described this clinical picture as encephalopathy rather than encephalitis due to negative findings on CSF investigations and cranial imaging. They had pneumonia and HBOV was determined in their tracheal and nasal specimens by PCR method. They had no preexisting neurological or metabolic disease. They neither required resuscitation, nor exposed to ischemia. No specific reason for encephalopathy was found after a thorough investigation. HBOV genome could not be investigated in CSF samples of these patients. Based on these findings, it could be postulated that HBOV viremia developed in patients with pneumonia and hematogenous spread of HBOV to the central nervous system caused the encephalopathy in these patients. However, why these four patients suffered from such a severe pneumonia followed by encephalopathy and others not is remained to be elucidated.",

It may cause severe respiratory infection requiring hospitalization and PICU admission. Although not confirmed microbiogically, its association with encephalopathy in four of our patients with pneumonia is the first report on this issue. Future studies with the use of quantitative PCR and serology of CSF are needed to determine the exact role of HBOV infection in encephalopathy.",
