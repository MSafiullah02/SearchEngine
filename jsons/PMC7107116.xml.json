            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a Gamma coronavirus and the causal agent of IB. This disease causes significant economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. To date, vaccination is the most widely used method to control IBV. Live, attenuated vaccines are the most commonly used in commercial poultry, particularly in broiler chickens. These vaccines are usually applied massively, through drinking water or spray and/or individually via the eye drop route. The main objective of the strategy is the generation of a protective local mucosal and humoral immunity. Secondary effects of live, attenuated IBV vaccination, such as mild respiratory signs as well as reduced egg production and eggshell quality in layers (Bwala et al., 2012), are a common outcome of their use. Due to the dozens of recognized serotypes and even more genotypes, IBV vaccination is challenging. The constant surveillance of field strains and the use of homologous vaccines is the only strategy to avoid failed protection against heterologous strains (Capua et al., 1999; Cavanagh, 2003; Cook et al., 2012). Therefore, improving live virus vaccines by adding components, such as adjuvants to boost mucosal innate and adaptive responses, is worth investigating.",

            "text": "Adjuvants have been used for decades in vaccine formulation. Oil-based emulsions and aluminium derivatives are routinely used in poultry inactivated vaccines to increase their immunogenicity and improve antigen delivery (Spickler and Roth, 2003). However, the use of adjuvants substantially increases the price of inactivated vaccines (Meeusen et al., 2007). Experimental utilization of adjuvants in live, attenuated vaccines for poultry has been previously investigated. Mucosal immune responses and protection of chickens against Newcastle disease virus (NDV) challenge after live attenuated vaccination of NDV were improved by using chitosan nanoparticles as adjuvant (Zhao et al., 2012). In addition, better antibody responses and protection against challenge in chickens was demonstrated when a live IBV vaccine was mixed with various types of adjuvants compared with a non-adjuvanted vaccine (Deville et al., 2012). Kjaerup and co-workers tested mannose-binding lectin ligands such as mannan, chitosan, and fructo-oligosaccharide as adjuvants in live IBV vaccines with mixed success (Kjaerup et al., 2014). In this study, we investigated the use of diatomaceous earth (DE) as an inexpensive and readily available adjuvant to boost local mucosal and adaptive immune responses generated by an IBV live, attenuated vaccine.",

In addition, silica, the main component of DE, has been reported to have higher colloid stability than aluminium hydroxide and to act as an adjuvant (Lincopan et al., 2009).
