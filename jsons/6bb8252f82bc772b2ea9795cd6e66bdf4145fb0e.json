            "text": "family Arteriviridae, which was recently grouped together with the coronaviruses and the toroviruses in the newly established order of the Nidovirales. 1 PRRSV is a spherical, enveloped virus with a diameter of 50 to 60 nm 2 and a positive-stranded RNA genome of 15.0-5.5 kilobases. 3 Nidovirus defective RNAs have been well documented and studied, especially for coronaviruses [4] [5] [6] and equine arterivirus (EAV). 7 Defective RNAs are truncated, and in some cases, rearranged genomes that have usually lost the potential to replicate autonomously due to deletions in the viral replicase gene(s), the replication of which depends on the replicase encoded by the helper virus. 7 Defective RNAs have retained all replication signals and, frequently, also the sequences required for RNA encapsidation. However, the generation of many of nidovirus defective RNAs requires serial undiluted different because they are persistently generated during infection, and arise in vitro as well as in vivo and have termed these RNA species heteroclites (latin: uncommon forms). PRRSV defective RNAs are heterogeneous in size and sequence and consist of, exclusively, complete 5' and 3' termini joined by short but variable nucleotide repeats. Thus, they contain different lengths of ORF1a and 3'-end sequences and are packaged into virions along with full-length PRRSV genomes. 8, 9 In order to further characterize PRRSV heteroclites, we have sequenced several species that represent varying lengths, and have prepared cDNA clones that correspond to two species (S1 and S7). In this study, we examined basic features of heteroclites S1 and S7 such as maintenance, RNA packaging and the encoding capability.",

In-frame insertion mutagenesis of type 2 porcine circovirus ORF2 gene (PCVORF2) into different positions of PRRSV heteroclite cDNAs of S7 or S1 was achieved by overlapping extension PCR. The resultant constructs were confirmed by sequencing and named pS7-PCVORF2/StuI (after leader sequence), pS7-PCVORF2/KpnI (genome position 480), and pS1-PCVORF2/SnaBI (genome position 1338). Linearized PRRSV infectious clone pVR-V7 and PCVORF2 gene modified S1 and S7 derivatives were obtained. RNAs were synthesized using mMESSAGE mMachine (Ambion). VR-V7 RNA was transfected alone or cotransfected with S7-PCVORF2/StuI, S2-PCVORF2/SnaBI or S7-PCVORF2/KpnI RNAs as described. 10 Northern blot analysis on infected cell supernatant was performed as described by Yuan. 8 Heteroclite RNA was translated with Flexi Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega) in the presence of 35 S-methionine (Amersham) and immunoprecipitated. 9, 11 Immunizations: Groups of 3-4 weeks PRRSV negative pigs (PCV antibody negative) were immunized by intramuscular injection of 2 ml of each PRRSV modified virus discussed above. Blood samples were collected from all animals on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 and examined for the presence of heteroclites and development of \u03b1PCV ORF2 antibodies.

Nested RT-PCR analysis on swine serum samples post-infection revealed that PCVORF2 mRNA could still be detected, which suggested that these defective RNA species could be replicated in vivo. PCVORF2 modified S7 replicated more efficiently than S1, because pigs inoculated with PCVORF2 modified S7 harbored the ORF2 gene for a longer time period (Fig. 1B) .

Previous work has shown that PRRSV heteroclite RNAs, but not subgenomic RNAs, could be packaged and since both heteroclite and subgenomic RNAs have complete 5' and 3' termini, we postulated that the PRRSV packaging signal may lie in the ORF1a region. 8 This notion was derived because the shortest heteroclite, S-9a (junction site nt 476/14344), was found to be in viral particles. 9 In this study, modified defective RNA S7 was packaged efficiently, either with PCVORF2 insertion right after the leader sequence (nt 190) or after the putative packaging signal (nt 476). This suggested that the packaging signal might indeed lie within this 286-bp region, perhaps located somewhere distant from the ORF1a fragment termini, as the insertions did not abort viral packaging. Additional work needs to be done to further define the packaging signal. S1 and S2 and their derivatives could be easily translated in in vitro, but we could not detect any protein products either in virus-infected cells or evidence of protein production, by production of \u03b1-PCV antibodies, in inoculated swine. Also, a cell line expressing S7 modified with GFP did not reveal any protein expression (data not shown). Perhaps the in vitro system does not reflect the situation in cultured cells or in vivo. Unknown factors from PRRSV or the host may inhibit translation or the expression level is not at detectable levels.",
