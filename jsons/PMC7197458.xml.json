This voltage difference was smaller than that reported in other cell systems, probably because of the low expression of Cav1.3 channels in mouse chromaffin cells. In sino\u2010atrial node cells, Mangoni et al. (2003) showed that Cav1 currents were activated at about \u221250 mV (WT cells) and \u221220 mV (Cav1.3\u2212/\u2212 cells) in 1.8 mM Ca2+. In heterologous systems, using 15\u201320 mM Ba2+, the V\nthreshold of activation for the Cav1.3 channels has been cited as \u221245.7 \u00b1 0.5 mV, and \u221231.5 mV for Cav1.2 channels (Koschak et al. 2001).

Expression in heterologous systems revealed differences in the inactivation behavior of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3 channels. Because of a more pronounced Ca2+ dependent inactivation, Cav1.3 channels could be faster inactivated with Ca2+ as the charge carrier, but voltage\u2010dependent inactivation (recorded in Ba2+) appeared slower than in Cav1.2 channels (Koschak et al. 2001; Xu and Lipscombe 2001; Yang et al. 2006; Singh et al. 2008). In native systems, Cav1.3 channels showed strong Ca2+ dependent inactivation in the sinoatrial node and the endocrine pancreas (Plant 1988; Zhang et al. 2002; Mangoni et al. 2003), while in inner hair cells Ca2+ dependent inactivation was much weaker or absent (Platzer et al. 2000; Marcotti et al. 2003; Michna et al. 2003; Song et al. 2003). This might be because of the inhibition of Ca2+ dependent inactivation by Ca2+ binding proteins (for a review see Striessnig 2007). Co\u2010expression of Cav1.3\u03b11 with syntaxin, vesicle\u2010associated membrane protein (VAMP) and synaptosomal\u2010associated protein (SNAP) also reduced the extent of Ca2+ current inactivation (Song et al. 2003). Our results might suggest that auxiliary subunits, or other channel associated proteins, could substantially condition the inactivation kinetics of Cav1 channels in the native system, and thus, give rise to differences with respect to channels expressed in heterologous systems.",

This major coupling of Cav1.2 channels to BK channels is also reflected in the identical parameters of the action potentials obtained after nifedipine treatment (300 nM or 3 \u03bcM) in WT and Cav1.3\u2212/\u2212 cells (Fig. 8, Table 2). Thus, the coupling between BK and Cav1.2 channels here observed would explain the change in the action potential waveform elicited by nifedipine, such that it slowed down the repolarisation stage of the action potential, with the consequent broadening of the spike (Fig. 8, Table 2).",

Despite this being the opposite effect expected of blocking the entry of positively charged ions, it reflects powerful coupling to BK channels, so that the net effect is to inhibit a net outward current, that is, the K+ flux triggered by the Ca2+ entry outweighs the Ca2+ entry itself, as has been previously reported (Jackson et al. 2004). The depolarization caused by the DHP might affect other conductances with the consequence of reducing the firing frequency (Bean 2007).

First, the number of cells exhibiting spontaneous firing and the frequency of spontaneous action potential firing were similar for WT and Cav1.3\u2212/\u2212 cells. Second, Cav1 channels represented 81% of the total Ca2+ current at the threshold potential in half the cells, with a major contribution of Cav1.2 channels (64% and 17% because of Cav1.2 and Cav1.3, respectively). Third, spontaneous action potential firing was fully blocked by TTX in half the WT and Cav1.3\u2212/\u2212 cells, or was driven by the toxin to an oscillatory activity in the other half of WT and Cav1.3\u2212/\u2212 cells, showing that the absence of Cav1.3 channels did not prevent the cell from firing. And finally, the oscillatory activity was abolished by nifedipine in WT and Cav1.3\u2212/\u2212 cells, which reflects this activity was mediated through Cav1.2 channels. The oscillatory activity sensitive to DHP had also been described in dorsomedial suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons (Jackson et al. 2004) or in adult, but not juvenile, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (Chan et al. 2007). This could therefore indicate that cells exhibiting Ca2+\u2010dependent firing might find themselves at a later developmental stage to those in which Ca2+ does not contribute to firing.",

Viroporins are a large family of viral proteins able to enhance membrane permeability, promoting virus budding. Mammalian cells are also readily permeabilized by the expression of MHV E protein (Madan et al. 2005). They form cation\u2010selective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers, with a high selectivity for Na+ (Wilson et al. 2004). In addition, MHV infection induces an immediate and transient Ca2+ increase in DBT cells, a murine astrocytoma cell line. The Ca2+ increase is the result of the influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium through Cav1 channels, as it is sensitive to nifedipine and verapamil (Kraeft et al. 1997). This implies that Cav1 channels are affected by MHV infection. Thus, if the Na+ and Ca2+ channels involved in firing are in some way altered in MHV infected cells, action potential firing might also be influenced. Na+ and Ca2+ entry to the cytosol might depolarize and inactivate certain channels related to firing, Na+ channels or Cav1 channel subtypes. This would explain why the Cav1.3\u2212/\u2212 mice in the study by Marcantoni and coworkers showed such a low percentage of spontaneously firing cells compared to their WT non\u2010infected counterparts.",

            "text": "Furthermore, cross\u2010talk between the immune system and the adrenal gland is well documented. For instance, there is increased catecholamine release by the adrenal medulla during periods of stress and infection (Zhou and Jones 1993). Further, cytokines stimulate the hypothalamic\u2010pituitary\u2010adrenal axis leading to augmented glucocorticoid production by the adrenal cortex (Turnbull and Rivier 1995; Buckingham et al. 1996). There are also direct paracrine interactions within the adrenal gland itself (Marx et al. 1998; Nussdorfer and Mazzocchi 1998), whereby cytokines are produced both by adrenal cells and by macrophages. Adrenal glands have a population of macrophages distributed throughout the cortex and medulla (Gonzalez\u2010Hernandez et al. 1994; Schober et al. 1998), some of which lie adjacent to the catecholamine producing chromaffin cells. Hence, in the particular case of MHV infection, this virus increases IL\u20106 production through p39 MAPK activation in macrophage\u2010derived J774.1 cells (Banerjee et al. 2002). It is known that IL\u20106 directly induces glucocorticoid production (Nussdorfer and Mazzocchi 1998; Willenberg et al. 2002), which increases adrenaline synthesis by stimulation of phenylethanolamine N\u2010methyltransferase activity (Wurtman and Axelrod 1966; Axelrod and Reisine 1984). Adrenaline is preferentially a \u03b2\u2010adrenergic agonist. \u03b21 and \u03b22 adrenergic receptors have been shown to modulate Cav1 channels in rat chromaffin cells (Cesetti et al. 2003). Therefore, MHV infection could also modify the paracrine modulation of Cav1 channel function through enhanced stress and elevated medullary catecholamine secretion.",

Similarly, in our study, Cav1.2 channels were the Cav1 channel subtypes that were most quickly inactivated, and consequently, they will contribute to the faster voltage dependent inactivation of Na+ channels. Na+ and Ca2+ channel inactivation are conditions required for subsequent initiation of Na+ and/or Ca2+ dependent action potentials to maintain repetitive firing.
