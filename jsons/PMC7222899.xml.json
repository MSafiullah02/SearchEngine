However, these conjectures were not translated into survival benefit as demonstrated by recent studies in adults \u2013 Oscillation in ARDS (OSCAR) [5] and Oscillation for ARDS treated early (OSCILLATE) [6]. The OSCAR study showed similar all cause 30-day mortality in the HFOV (41.7%) and CMV (41.1%) groups but higher use of sedatives and muscle relaxants in the HFOV group, while the OSCILLATE study showed a higher mortality in the HFOV group (47%) as compared to the controlled ventilation group (35%). There was also greater requirement of inotropic and vasopressor support in patients randomised to HFOV, and these factors prompted the OSCILLATE study to be halted after an interim 500-patient analysis. Optimal HFOV settings, timing of transition, disease specific benefits and patient related factors influencing the final outcome on HFOV are still under considerable debate and so, the uncertainty regarding its benefit in the pediatric population still prevails with survival rates ranging from 40 to 80% [7\u201311].",

The present results show that while both survivors and non-survivors trended an improvement in OI along with increase in P/F ratio within 24 h of initiation of HFOV, only the survivors continued with sustained improvement upto 48 h of ventilation. Thus, based on the OI and P/F ratio, the response to HFOV between 24 and 48 h of ventilation could help identify potential survivors. Even though both groups were transitioned to HFOV with an OI > 25, the survivors achieved OI ~ 20 within 12 h of initiation, and P/F ratios more than 100 within 24 h. This aspect may guide the physician to re-evaluate ventilation strategy or employ other rescue therapies in patients who are not likely to respond to HFOV. Also lower PEEP on CMV and shorter duration of CMV before initiation of HFOV was associated with survival. The present results corroborate the findings in previous studies which link improved oxygenation parameters with survival [17\u201320].",

Severe PARDS is associated with higher mortality (61%) in resource limited settings if associated with multiorgan dysfunction and severe sepsis [21], and thus have lesser chances of responding to salvage therapies. All the non-survivors had non-pulmonary multi-organ dysfunction and refractory septic shock confounding the survival rate \u2013 which could be attributed to the nosocomial infections associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation (median = 12 d in non-survivors). Similar settings with comparable patient population have reported survival rates close to present one \u2013 Pinzon et al. [22] recorded a mortality rate of 52%, 28 d after the onset of ARDS. The median OI in present study for starting HFOV in survivors vs. non-survivors was [29.5 (23.8, 31.5) vs. 38.5 (30, 53), p = 0.1] and this could be attributed to a late decision to transition to HFOV. All the survivors had non-bacterial pneumonia as cause of PARDS namely \u2013 Severe malaria, iatrogenic aspiration pneumonia with pneumothorax, late presenting Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC), dengue shock syndrome, and influenza (H1N1) pneumonia. This is in contrast to a study by Babbitt et al. [23] who reported statistically improved survival in both bacterial and viral pneumonia in their retrospective study from North America. They identified a higher SOFA score at admission, a lower percentage increase in P/F ratio at 24 h and a higher OI at 48 h of initiation of HFOV as being associated with increased odds of death in HFOV recipients after adjusting for predictor variables (gender and OI at 24 h). Comporota et al. [19] in their study of patients with ARDS reported an improvement in P/F ratio > 38% at any time within 72 h of HFOV as being good predictor of survival at 30 d. In the present study, a higher percentage increase in P/F ratio at 48 h was identified in survivors as compared to non-survivors [58% (1.15, 65.3) vs. 27% (4, 59.9), p = 0.3] though not statistically significant, however, the percentage decrease in OI at 48 h of HFOV was similar in both groups [36.5% (0.4, 64.3) vs. 35.5% (10, 54.3), p = 0.5] \u2013 this could be explained by the different levels of MAP used and poor recruitability of lungs in non-survivors.",

Hence use of sedative \u2013 analgesics and neuromuscular blockade titrated to tolerance of mechanical ventilation with appropriate drug holidays is standard norm in most PICUs. The present results show a higher VIS at 24 h in survivors vs. non-survivors [22.5 (1.25, 44.5) vs. 15 (0, 43)] with a rapid taper in the subsequent 24 h in survivors against prolonged requirement of inotropes and vasopressors by non-survivors at 48 h [VIS at 48 h: 4.25 (1.25, 17.5) vs. 15 (0, 80), p = 0.29], and this could be explained by the higher cumulative doses of vasodilating fentanyl and muscle relaxant infusion used in the survivors, which may have curtailed work of imposed breathing [27] that can arise from asynchrony or high inspiratory flow demands. A reduction in cardiac output upon initiation of HFOV, as demonstrated in infants in two pediatric studies may have also accounted for increased inotropic requirements in the immediate 24 h period [27, 28].",
