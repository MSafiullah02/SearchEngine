It is important, therefore, to target treatment to individuals considered to have hyperinflammation. Diagnostic criteria in this patient group are poorly developed and there is no consensus, as seen from the inclusion criteria listed for the ongoing anakinra trials (table). Although serum ferritin and IL-6 concentrations are highly specific to hyperinflammation and have been shown to be associated with a need for ventilation in patients with COVID-19,8 they are not routinely measured in the clinical setting, a shortcoming that is highly relevant given the requirement to identify as many patients as possible that might benefit. We suggest a pragmatic approach to patient selection based on identifying patients with progressive disease and evidence of increasing inflammation. Therefore, we propose using worsening lymphopenia, a marker of disease progression and severity in COVID-19, and increasing C-reactive protein as evidence of worsening inflammation.",

Variation in dosing needs to be minimised to ensure constant and adequate bioavailability, and to avoid a detrimental rebound increase of inflammation. Pharmacokinetic studies in various disease states have shown that subcutaneous anakinra might ensure adequate and consistent plasma concentrations, with bioavailability ranging from 80\u201395%.9, 10 Concerns have been raised regarding the suitability of subcutaneous drug administration in patients in intensive care because they are susceptible to the development of peripheral oedema and poor skin perfusion. Repeated subcutaneous injections might also lead to patient discomfort. However, these downsides should be weighed against the considerable benefits of subcutaneous administration in the context of this pandemic, which include easy administration by any health-care professional, increased cost-effectiveness with no need for infusion pumps or equivalent, and reduced fluid load. Reduced fluid load is important as current guidelines for management of severe ARDS recommend a negative fluid balance of 0\u00b75\u20131\u00b70 L per day,11 and the most commonly adopted mode of intravenous anakinra results in infusion of a minimum of 400 mL of fluid.",

It is rare for single trials to provide definitive answers, so a core set of outcomes that are reported by all trials of a given intervention are important to allow systematic reviewers to combine results in similar patient populations.12 Of the ten identified trials (table), six trials consider patients with a severe condition. These trials are dominated by the REMAP-CAP trial (NCT02735707), which has an open-ended recruitment and a target of 7100 patients. The other five trials have a total of fewer than 400 participants receiving anakinra, with no outcome common to all. Some trials focus on effectiveness (clinical) and others on efficacy (biomarker) endpoints. The other four trials include patients with less severe disease but who are hospitalised, with total recruitment around 250 participants. These trials have a similar mix of effectiveness and efficacy endpoints, with mortality being the most commonly reported outcome. Only five trials explicitly mention ferritin as an outcome, which is regarded as an important parameter for assessing hyperinflammation, and these trials will report data in different ways that will preclude pooling. Even without the clinical heterogeneity inherent in the range of eligibility criteria and dosing regimens under study (table), power for meaningful meta-analysis will be low.",
