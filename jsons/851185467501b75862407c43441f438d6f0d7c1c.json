Over the next weeks, SARS-CoV-2 caused a global pandemic as officially declared by the WHO on March 11, 2020, with confirmed cases and deaths in more than 166 countries. We are experiencing a worldwide phenomenon of unprecedented social and economic consequences. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, there have been fears that the epidemic could strongly impact weaker healthcare systems in poor-resource settings, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The 2 million Chinese nationals that live and work in Africa could potentially contribute to the spread of COVID-19 on the continent.",

Similarly, SSA countries could take advantage of the large number of existing GeneXpert \u00e2 tools, located at both central and peripheral laboratories. GeneXpert \u00e2 is a multi-disease diagnostic platform used initially to test TB and later adapted for HIV and Ebola. The GxAlert, a web-based data management system associated to GeneXpert \u00e2 , allows automatic transfer of test results from the diagnostic device to the GxAlert web server. This avoids delays in notifications and helps to monitor testing in the whole country, two key aspects for successful containment of an emerging infectious outbreak. As of March 21, thanks to an emergency approval by the US FDA, GeneXpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 cartridges are available on the market. If properly rolled out, such technology will allow to decentralize SARS-Cov-2 testing and provide results in less than 45 min with minimal staff training. On the other hand, the implementation of GeneXpert presents major challenges, particularly related to cost and infrastructure. The price of GeneXpert equipment and cartridges had been an undeniable barrier for scaling up this technology in many LMICs and could be a major problem during the current pandemic.",

Their model of 388,287 passengers traveling to 1,297 airports, estimated that the risk of transmission to Africa and South America was relatively low. Conversely, Asian and European countries showed a high risk of transmission (Haider et al, 2020) . In line with this prediction, Europe and North America are now the most affected regions by COVID-19 in the world, while SSA lags far behind.",

In the Chinese data, COVID-19 crude fatality rate (CFR) for people older than 80 years increases up to 21.9%. While in 2019 the number of people aged 65 years or older in Europe and North America were 200.9 million (18% of the population), SSA has a very young population in comparison, with a median age of 19.7 years and only 31.9 million people or 3% of the population aged 65 years or older (https://www.un. org/en/development/desa/population/publi cations/pdf/ageing/WorldPopulationAgeing 2019-Highlights.pdf). We can thus hope for a lower percentage of severe SARS-CoV-2 cases necessitating intensive treatment that may not uniformly be available across SSA.",

ACE2 is involved in the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS) that regulates blood pressure and is expressed in epithelial cells of the lung and other organs. ACE-inhibitors, commonly prescribed blood-pressure drugs, are less effective in African Americans compared with Caucasians, which has been linked to genetic predisposition of African Americans to higher baseline RAAS activity with increased susceptibility to salt retention rather than to the ACE protein itself (Spence & Rayner, 2018) . There are limited data associating genetic background to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity and no evidence so far of ACE2 polymorphisms that confer resistance to viral infection. Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing expression data (preprint: Zhao et al, 2020) , although limited in the numbers of donors analyzed, noticed that lung tissue from an Asian male had significantly higher ACE2expressing cell content than Caucasian or African American donors. Such findings might suggest different susceptibility to infection or to the severe forms of COVID-19 based on ethnic background but must be further validated in appropriate studies.",

Thus, it is of vital importance to acknowledge and understand local customs and cultural beliefs so as to apply and adapt infection control policies. From such past experience, SSA has learnt positive lessons and pre-existing isolation facilities which may aid in its future battle against SARS-CoV-2.",

Preliminary and anecdotal data gathered from Italian hospitals have revealed a low percentage of COVID-19 severe patients from SSA. This relatively low number could be caused by younger asymptomatic carriers, poor selfreporting of mildly symptomatic patients, and/ or from limited access to the healthcare system.
