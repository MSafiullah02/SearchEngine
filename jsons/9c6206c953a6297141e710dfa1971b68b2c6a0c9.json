However, most microarray assays are labour-intensive and time-consuming to perform. This study describes the development and initial evaluation of a multiplex reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and novel accompanying automated electronic microarray assay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of seven important viruses that affect swine (foot-and-mouth disease virus [FMDV], swine vesicular disease virus [SVDV], vesicular exanthema of swine virus [VESV], African swine fever virus [ASFV], classical swine fever virus [CSFV], porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus [PRRSV] and porcine circovirus type 2 [PCV2]). The novel electronic microarray assay utilizes a single, user-friendly instrument that integrates and automates capture probe printing, hybridization, washing and reporting on a disposable electronic microarray cartridge with 400 features. This assay accurately detected and identified a total of 68 isolates of the seven targeted virus species including 23 samples of FMDV, representing all seven serotypes, and 10 CSFV strains, representing all three genotypes.

All capture probes were highly specific and showed no cross-reactivity with heterologous viruses, non-target bacteria and viruses, or samples from healthy animals. PRRSV was originally detected in North America and Europe almost simultaneously (Christianson & Joo, 1994; Lunney et al., 2016) . The two genotypes were genetically diverse with about 55%-70% nucleotide identity (Lunney et al., 2016 (Haines et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Rasmussen et al., 2006; Shi et al., 2016; Wernike et al., 2012 Wernike et al., , 2013 , the diagnosis of FMDV, SVDV, CSFV and ASFV still requires the performance of multiple single tests. Automated multiplex assays can potentially reduce labour cost and handling time. The highest analytical sensitivities observed for the 7-plex RT-PCR were as follows: PRRSV, PCV2 and ASFV which have the smallest amplicons (379-537 bp). Although the microarray assay successfully detected FMDV in dpi 1 samples from experimentally infected animals, the multiplex RT-PCR was less efficient for amplification of FMDV, which had the largest amplicon size in the assay (971 bp). This is most likely due to reduced PCR efficiencies for large amplicons (Cheng, Fockler, Barnes, & Higuchi, 1994; Huang, Arnheim, & Goodman, 1992) . The FMDV primers used in this study were specifically designed to amplify the highly variable Isolate F I G U R E 3 Multiplex RT-PCR amplicons visualized using QIAxcel System (a) and heat map depicting the reactivity of 10 genetically diverse Canadian PRRSV-positive serum samples from diagnostic submissions against 27 virus-specific capture probes and one nonspecific binding probe (NSBP) (b). The panel of samples includes the following: #2 (17-001377-0001_1-57-1), #7 (17-007044-2208_1-3-2), #11 (17-010599-0006_1-30-2), #20 (17-019861-0006_1-1-1), #21 (17-020077-0002_1-8-4), #22 (17-020084-0001_1-3-2),-#23 (17-020347-0011_1-8-2), #33 (17-035-986_1-4-1), #36 (17-039858-0022_2-5-2), #43 (17-052259-0023_1-57-1). A positive signal in red represents a positive-to-negative ratio (P/N) of >2, while negative results in black represent any P/N \u2264 2 capture probes, the amplicon or the annealing of the two strands of the amplicons which could prevent efficient hybridization between the capture probes and the amplicon under the experimental conditions. The use of asymmetric PCR to generate single-stranded products, increased amount of capture probe and/or amplicon may also further increase the sensitivity of the assay. Although not tested in this study due to resource constraints, previously published electronic microarray assays for detection of avian, swine and bovine viruses (Lung et al., 2012 (Lung et al., , 2017 , were able to detect the presence of more than one target. Due to potentially high loads of viruses such as PCV2 in many countries, the splitting of the sevenplex RT-PCR into a duplex RT-PCR for PRRSV and PCV2 and a fiveplex RT-PCR for the other viruses, as described in this study, will improve the sensitivity of the assay for the detection of reportable diseases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 489, "end": 515, "text": "(Christianson & Joo, 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 516, "end": 536, "text": "Lunney et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 621, "end": 641, "text": "(Lunney et al., 2016", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 642, "end": 663, "text": "(Haines et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 664, "end": 680, "text": "Li et al., 2013;", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 681, "end": 704, "text": "Rasmussen et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 705, "end": 722, "text": "Shi et al., 2016;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 723, "end": 743, "text": "Wernike et al., 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 744, "end": 766, "text": "Wernike et al., , 2013", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1455, "text": "(Cheng, Fockler, Barnes, & Higuchi, 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1456, "end": 1488, "text": "Huang, Arnheim, & Goodman, 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2878, "end": 2896, "text": "(Lung et al., 2012", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2897, "end": 2917, "text": "(Lung et al., , 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 195, "end": 199, "text": "= 8)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "| DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Although an RT step was not required for DNA viruses, previous studies have shown better amplification of the DNA targets when a RT step was included (Lung et al., 2017) .

Due to the high genetic diversity of RNA viruses and the lack of more PRRSV (especially genotype 2) isolates available for testing, regular evaluation of the primers and probe sequences against newly available sequences and additional validation will be needed. The large number of capture probes (up to 400 for the electronic microarray used here) should allow better coverage of genetically diverse strains compared with real-time RT-PCRs, which can typically accommodate only a few probes. The ability to print custom capture probes on site without additional instrumentation allows the assay to be updated conveniently.Conventional testing methods, such as virus isolation, ELISA and PCR, have been advocated by the OIE as gold standard tests for the detection of many viral infections. Although these methods can be highly sensitive to specific viral serotypes, methods like virus isolation are time-consuming, requiring multiple blind passages of a sample to generate usable amounts of infectious material. Additionally, multiple tests are required to detect coinfections or to differentiate between species with clinically indistinguishable signs.
