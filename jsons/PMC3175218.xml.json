ESPED actively collected monthly reports on the occurrence of severe influenza-associated cases requiring intensive care treatment from all hospitals. Monthly reporting was requested even if no cases were identified. For identified cases, the hospitals were asked to return anonymous, structured questionnaires on basic demographic characteristics, underlying chronic medical conditions, influenza vaccination status, and influenza diagnostics, symptoms, treatment, pre-defined complications, and sequelae. The reporting physician filled in the questionnaire according to the information from the medical chart.

He was diagnosed with influenza A one day after PICU admission and was started on oseltamivir treatment. He died 4 days after admission from massive cerebral edema. The autopsy report stated death due to cardiac and circulatory failure. Streptococcus pneumoniae was diagnosed from PCR analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue, indicating encephalopathy following influenza infection complicated by bacterial superinfection of the CNS. In 2008, a second fatality was reported from a 13-year-old boy with several chronic underlying diseases (asthma bronchiale, cardiac malformation, Addison's disease). He was found unconscious by his parents after febrile infection during the previous week. After resuscitation he was transported to the hospital where he died in the emergency room from cardiac and respiratory failure.

            "text": "We describe the results from a nation-wide surveillance study on severe paediatric seasonal influenza cases in Germany during three pre-pandemic influenza seasons between 2005 and 2008. A total of 20 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated PICU cases (14 influenza type A, 5 type B, 1 type unknown), including two fatalities, were reported. This number was surprisingly low and corresponded to an estimated annual incidence for PICU-admitted children with seasonal influenza of 0.1/100,000 children < 5 years of age. In contrast, for the same age group incidences of PICU admissions associated with seasonal influenza were 4/100,000 in USA and 1-13/100,000 in South Australia [5,7]. Apart from country-specific differences in access to health care as well as in criteria for ICU hospitalisation, the lower incidence found in our study may also be due to the weak to moderate influenza activity during the observation period in Germany [11]. Another important explanation is possible under-diagnosis of influenza in the hospitals, as not all physicians perform influenza testing of children admitted with severe acute respiratory infection. Low participation in the voluntary reporting system due to frequent changes of the medical staff in the PICUs is a further possible reason. Hence, the low reported incidence for PICU-admitted influenza cases in this study may underestimate the true incidence of severe paediatric influenza cases in Germany. With regard to fatal paediatric cases it should be noted that our study was not designed to capture influenza-associated fatalities that occurred outside PICUs, e.g. at home or during emergency treatment. For comparison, the national mortality register reported a total of 25 influenza-associated (ICD-10 code J10) deaths in children < 15 years of age during the years 2006 to 2008.",

Eleven (55%) belonged to risk groups with chronic underlying disease, including eight (40%) of at least two years of age for whom influenza vaccines are considered to be efficacious [21]. One risk group child was below 6 months of age and, hence, too young to be immunized. Two other risk group children were under two years of age; for this age group, the efficacy of the inactivated influenza vaccines licensed in Germany is unclear, and data on safety are insufficient thus far [21]. Forty-five% of the patients with severe influenza were previously healthy children, who would not be covered by a risk-based vaccination strategy. A recommendation to vaccinate healthy children routinely against seasonal influenza is not widespread in Europe, but has been argued to have potential community benefits [22].",

An ongoing ESPED study on children with severe pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 reported 93 cases below 15 years of age from 55 PICUs during a single season (August 2009 to April 2010), including 15 fatalities (11 within PICUs) [24]. This high number of cases reported in the ongoing ESPED study may be partly due to an increased awareness in physicians regarding the new subtype of influenza with unclear severity at the start of the pandemic, resulting in more frequent laboratory testing and diagnosis of influenza [5,24]. Additionally, the higher number of PICU admissions may be due to a truly higher severity of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 subtype in children compared to previous seasonal influenza subtypes [e.g., [18,25]], although not all studies report such a difference in severity [26,27], or found a difference only regarding risk groups [28]. Thus, a comparison of both ESPED studies on the absolute number of severe influenza cases [24] has to be regarded with caution, and may underestimate the importance of severe seasonal influenza caused by non-pandemic influenza virus subtypes in children in Germany. Further prospective, laboratory-confirmed surveillance in PICUs is needed to clarify the complication rates associated with influenza virus A and B and their different subtypes and lineages.",

In these children the severe course of disease might have been prevented by vaccination. Oseltamivir treatment was often started several days after start of influenza symptoms or PICU admission, indicating that influenza is often diagnosed too late for effective antiviral patient treatment. The general incidence of influenza-associated severe disease in German PICUs was very low, but under-diagnosis and under-reporting during these pre-pandemic influenza seasons may be likely. Therefore prospective studies providing influenza subtype screening on PICU admissions of children with respiratory disease are needed to assess more accurately the burden of severe influenza-associated complications.
