However, infl ammation is potentially harmful and may even be life threatening. Since most of the essential components of the infl ammatory process are found in the circulation, infl ammation occurs only in vascularized tissue. Infl ammation is generally considered a nonspecifi c response, because it happens in the same way regardless of the stimulus and the number of exposures to the stimulus [ 2 ] . This is different from the immune system, which has memory, and the antigens are specifi c and induce a specifi c response.",

This is the hallmark of acute infl ammation, which may also be called exudative infl ammation. It indicates signifi cant alteration in the normal permeability of the small blood vessels in the region of injury. The two components of exudate, fl uid and protein, serve good purposes. Fluid increase helps to dilute the toxins. Protein increase includes globulins that provide protective antibodies, while fi brin helps to limit the spread of bacteria and promotes healing. Exudate varies in composition. In early or mild infl ammation, it may be watery (serous exudate) with low plasma protein content and few leukocytes. In more advanced infl ammation, the exudate becomes thick and clotted (fi brinous exudate). When large numbers of leukocytes accumulate (Fig. 4.3 ) , the exudate consists of pus and is called suppurative, while if it contains erythrocytes due to bleeding, it is referred to as hemorrhagic. Pus, accordingly, is a variant of exudate that is particularly rich in leukocytes, mostly neutrophils and parenchymal cell debris.",

Abdominal surgery (particularly of the colon, appendix, and biliary tree) and trauma are the most common; less common are appendicitis, diverticulitis, and pelvic infl ammatory disease. The formation of fi brin in the abdominal cavity is a common pathophysiological pathway for abdominal abscess formation due to diminished fi brin degradation. Hyaluronan-based agents were found to reduce adhesion formation after surgery and reduce abscess formation in experimental peritonitis. Possible mechanisms of action of hyaluronan include modulation of the infl ammatory response and enhanced fi brinolysis [ 7 ] . Low pH, large bacterial inocula, poor perfusion, the presence of hemoglobin, and large amounts of fi brin (which impedes antibiotic penetration) make the abscess a cloistered environment that is penetrated poorly by many antimicrobial therapies [ 8 , 9 ] . Therefore, management of these infections requires prompt recognition, early localization, and effective drainage, as well as appropriate antimicrobial use. Once the diagnosis is made and the abscess is localized, treatment should begin promptly. Percutaneous or open surgical drainage should be used. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given until culture and sensitivity data are obtained. Localization is crucial since, for example, percutaneous drainage is inappropriate for abscesses in certain locations such as the posterior subphrenic space or in the porta hepatis. In the liver, abscesses occur in the right lobe in approximately 95 % of the cases, and in 70 % of cases, the liver abscesses are solitary [ 10 ] .",

The two major types of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Crohn's disease is also referred to as regional enteritis, terminal ileitis, or granulomatous ileocolitis. IBD is a dis-ease of industrialized nations and observed most commonly in Northern Europe and North America. Incidence among whites is approximately four times that of other races, slightly greater in females and higher in Ashkenazi Jews (those who have immigrated from Northern Europe) than in other groups. The risk of developing UC is higher in nonsmokers and former smokers than in current smokers. Incidence peaks in the second and third decades of life. A second smaller peak occurs in patients aged 55-65 years. CD and UC can occur in childhood, although the incidence is much lower in children younger than 15 years with some differences in presentation and more negative effect on quality of life in younger age group [ 11 ] .",

A great deal of research has been performed to discover potential genes linked to IBD. One of the early linkages discovered was on chromosome 16 ( IBD1 gene), which led to the identifi cation of the NOD2 gene (now called CARD15 ) as the fi rst gene clearly associated with IBD (as a susceptibility gene for Crohn's disease). Studies have also provided strong support for IBD susceptibility genes on chromosomes 5 (5q31) and 6 (6p21 and 19p). None of these mechanisms have been implicated as the primary cause, but they are postulated as potential causes. The lymphocyte population in persons with IBD is polyclonal, making the search for a single precipitating cause diffi cult. The trigger for the activation of the immune response has not been defi ned. However, possible triggers include a pathogenic organism (unidentifi ed yet), an immune response to an intraluminal antigen (e.g., cow's milk protein), or an autoimmune process with immune response to an intraluminal antigen and a similar antigen present on intestinal epithelial cells. In any case, activation of the immune system leads to infl ammation of the intestinal tract, both acute and chronic [ 12 -19 ] .",

The disease is now recognized as a member of a large family of granulomatous disorders and has been reported from all parts of the world. Current evidence points to genetic predisposition and exposure to yet unknown transmissible agent(s) and/or environmental factors as etiological agents [ 21 ] . The lung is most commonly and usually the fi rst site of involvement, and the infl ammatory processes extend through the lymphatics to the hilar and mediastinal nodes [ 22 ] . The lung is involved in more than 90 % of cases. Pulmonary sarcoidosis starts as diffuse interstitial alveolitis, followed by the characteristic granulomas. Granulomas are present in the alveolar septa as well as in the walls of the bronchi and pulmonary arteries and veins. The center of the granuloma contains epithelioid cells derived from mononuclear phagocytes, multinucleated giant cells, and macrophages. Lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, and fi broblasts are present at the periphery of the granuloma [ 23 ] . Sarcoidosis represents a challenge to clinical investigation because of its unpredictable course, uncertain response to therapy, and diversity of potential organ involvement and clinical presentations [ 24 ] . The diagnosis is based on a compatible clinical and/or radiological picture, histopathological evidence of noncaseating granulomas in tissue biopsy specimens, and exclusion of other diseases capable of producing similar clinical or histopathological appearances. Even microscopically, the noncaseating granulomas are not specifi c [ 21 ] . Infection by mycobacterial species other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis frequently leads to the production of noncaseating granulomas [ 25 ] . The condition is underdiagnosed in some areas.

Binding to bacteria -99m Tc-labeled ciprofl oxacin antibiotic -67 Ga citrate 6. Metabolic trapping, i.e., F-18 fl uorodeoxyglucose Since there are limitations to the radiopharmaceuticals available for imaging infection, the search continues for better agents with ideal properties [ 56 -59 ] . They should: 1. Be easy to prepare 2. Have low cost and wide availability 3. Ensure rapid detection and localization of infections (< 3 h) 4. Have low toxicity and produce no immune response 5. Clear rapidly from the blood with no significant uptake in the liver, spleen, GI tract, bone, kidneys, bone marrow, or muscle 6. Clear rapidly from the background 7.

Be able to differentiate acute from chronic infection Gallium-67 has been used for many years to detect infl ammation. The multiple mechanisms of uptake of gallium by infl ammatory tissue include the following: 1. Increased vascular permeability 2. Gallium-67-binding substances at the site of infl ammation \u2022 Transferrin (due to leakage of plasma proteins) \u2022 Lactoferrin (secreted with lysosomal contents of stimulated or dead neutrophils) \u2022 Siderophores produced by bacteria 3. Leukocytes: direct uptake 4. Bacteria: direct uptake Sfakianakis et al. [ 60 ] found that 111 In leukocyte imaging accuracy was best for relatively acute infections (less than 2 weeks) but yielded a 27 % false-negative rate among patients with prolonged infections. On the other hand, 67 Ga imaging had its highest sensitivity in long-standing processes, with false-negative results of 19 % in relatively acute infections of less than 1-week duration. In a comparative study of rabbits with experimental abscesses, Bitar et al. [ 61 ] found that 111 In leukocytes were clearly superior to gallium for imaging early abscesses. Furthermore, they found that the accumulation of 111 In leukocytes in experimental subcutaneous abscesses was inversely proportional to the age of the abscess. In abscesses 1-2 h, 6-8 h, 24 h, and 7 days old, 10.4, 5.2, 3, and 0.73 % of the injected dose, respectively, was accumulated. 67 Ga uptake, on the other hand, was not signifi cantly affected by abscess age (Table 4.4 ) . In abscesses 7 days old, 67 Ga accumulated to a greater extent than did 111 In-labeled leukocytes. Thus, Bitar et al., based on animal studies, and Stakianakis et al. came independently to the conclusion that 111 In-labeled WBCs are more suitable for acute infections of short duration, while 67 Ga labeling is better for infections of longer duration.",

This high propensity of white blood cells to migrate to an abscess makes positive identifi cation of the abscess likely on an 111 In WBC image. The authors also showed abscess-to-muscle ratios of 3,000 to 1 with 111 In WBCs at 24 h compared with 72 to 1 with 67 Ga and 7 to 1 with 111 In chloride. Accordingly, a small dose of only 500 \u03bcCi of 111 In leukocytes is suffi cient for positive identifi cation and localization of abscesses on an image. In 67 Ga imaging, a higher dose of approximately 5 mCi is needed. There is a higher radiation dose to the spleen from 500 \u03bcCi of 111 In WBC but radiation doses to gonads, marrow, and the whole body are higher with 5 mCi of 67 Ga. 99m Tc HMPAO-labeled WBCs could provide fast diagnosis and localization of the abdomen (within 2-4 h). Physiological bowel activity, however, is found in 7 % at 2 h and in 28 % of patients imaged with this agent at 4 h. Leukocytes labeled with 111 In or 99m Tc HMPAO are superior to those labeled with 67 Ga for acute infections in terms of sensitivity and specifi city [ 63 , 64 ] .",

LeukoScan uptake at the site of infection is explained partly by the migration of circulating antibody-labeled granulocytes to the site of infection. Uptake is also explained by the fact that the greater proportion of the labeled antibody fragment is in a free soluble form which can easily cross capillary membranes, binding to the leukocyte once in situ. This mechanism is favored by the increased capillary permeability at the site of infection. An important advantage of LeukoScan is the 5 min preparation time compared with the 2 h 30 min required by a specialized team for labeling leukocytes. Despite the fact that LeukoScan involves the i.v. injection of mouse proteins, no anaphylactic or other hypersensitivity reactions were observed. 99m Tc ciprofl oxacin ( Infecton ) is also being used to image infection. Ciprofl oxacin is a broad-spectrum fl uoroquinolone antibiotic that inhibits DNA gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV of bacteria. Patients receive 99m Tc ciprofl oxacin 10 mCi, and images are obtained at 1, at 3-4, and, occasionally, at 24 h postinjection. 99m Tc ciprofl oxacin may be useful in distinguishing infection from infl ammation. Early images of noninfectious rheumatologic infl ammatory conditions were positive, but activity decreased with time [ 69 ] . 111 In-and 99m Tc-labeled chemotactic peptide analogs have been used for detecting and localizing infections. Imaging can be performed at less than 3 h postinjection, which compares favorably with the 18-24 h or more for most other agents [ 54 ] .",

Infl ammatory conditions show high FDG uptake which is related to increased glucose metabolism that is produced by stimulated infl ammatory cells, macrophage proliferation, and healing [ 75 ] . While uptake of FDG continues to increase at malignant sites for several hours, as can be shown by an incremental increase of the standardized uptake values (SUV), infl ammatory lesions peak at approximately 60 min, and their SUV either stabilize or decline thereafter. This difference in the behavior of FDG in malignant versus infl ammatory cells can be explained best by the varying levels of enzymes that degrade deoxyglucose-6-phosphate in the respective cells. Glucose-6-phosphatase dephosphorylates intracellular FDG-6-phosphate, allowing it to leave the cell. It has been shown that most tumor cells have low levels of this enzyme, while its expression is high in the mononuclear cells [ 76 -85 ] . For this reason, imaging at 2 time points after administration of FDG may prove to be important in differentiating between these two common disorders.",

The ability to image the entire body is the major advantage of nuclear medicine modalities ( Fig. 4.10 ) . Hence, radionuclide techniques are often used in cases with no localizing signs. In one study, 16 % of patients suspected of having abdominal infection in fact had extraabdominal infections as seen on 111 In leukocyte scans [ 95 ] . Accordingly, negative morphological modalities, when used fi rst, may be followed by whole-body nuclear imaging. Labeled WBC studies are the most specifi c for acute infections (Figs. 4.11 and 4.12 ) . Ga-67 is more suitable for infection of longer duration (Fig. 4.13 ). 99m Tc HMPAO-labeled WBCs frequently are used in critically ill patients [ 39 ] after US and/or CT have yielded inconclusive results. It is worthy of note that 99m Tc HMPAO-labeled WBCs provide quicker results than 67 Ga-or 111 In-labeled WBCs. Minoja et al. [ 96 ] reported a sensitivity of 95 %, a specifi city of 91 %, and an accuracy of 94 % for 99m Tc-labeled WBC scanning in intensive care unit patients with occult infections.

CT scanning and ultrasonography are best for demonstrating complications such as intra-abdominal abscesses and fi stulas. Evaluation of the extent of the disease and disease activity is often diffi cult. A wide variety of approaches depicting the different stages of the infl ammatory response have been developed. Nonspecifi c radiolabeled compounds, such as 67Ga citrate and radiolabeled polyclonal a b Fig. 4.9 Representative images of CT scans of the abdomen illustrating ( a ) periappendicular abscess ( arrow ) and ( b ) hepatic abscess ( arrow ) human immunoglobulin, accumulate in infl ammatory foci due to enhanced vascular permeability. Specifi c accumulation of radiolabeled compounds in infl ammatory lesions results from binding to activated endothelium (e.g., radiolabeled anti-E-selectin), the enhanced infl ux of leukocytes (e.g., radiolabeled autologous leukocytes, antigranulocyte antibodies, or cytokines), the enhanced glucose uptake by activated leukocytes (18F-fl uorodeoxyglucose), or direct binding to microorganisms (e.g., radiolabeled ciprofl oxacin or antimicrobial peptides). Scintigraphy using autologous leukocytes, labeled with 111 In or 99mTc, is still considered the \"gold standard\" nuclear medicine technique for the imaging of infection and infl ammation, but the range of radiolabeled compounds available for this indica-tion is still expanding. Recently, positron emission tomography with 18F-fl uorodeoxyglucose has been shown to delineate various infectious and infl ammatory disorders with high sensitivity . In a study [ 98 ] , gallium, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and PET-FDG were compared for their ability to detect disease activity. PET-FDG showed more than twice as many lesions in the abdomen of patients with Crohn's disease as did gallium. Not all lesions on MRI were FDG positive, suggesting they might represent areas of prior infl ammation.",

The sensitivity of US has been shown to be less than 60 % [ 105 ] and is signifi cantly inferior to that of cortical scintigraphy (sensitivity of 86 % and specifi city of 81 % using 99mTc-glucoheptonate). Positive ultrasonography can obviate the need for DMSA; however, because of a large number of false-negative results with reported sensitivities of 42-58 % and underestimation of the pyelonephritis lesions, ultrasonography cannot replace 99mTc-DMSA [ 106 ] . To date 99mTc-DMSA is considered the most sensitive method for the detection of acute pyelonephritis in children ( Fig. 4.16 ). It also permits the photopenic area to be calculated as the infl ammatory volume which correlates with the severity of infection and the possibility of scar formation even though some of the defects detected might be too small to be clinically signifi cant. Currently US is recommended as the initial imaging modalities by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in atypical and recurrent UTI in pediatric age group [ 107 , 108 ] . The pathophysiological basis of the ability of Doppler sonography in detecting acute pyelonephritis is the fact that in the acute phase of pyelonephritis the, focal decrease of renal perfusion due to edema causes vascular compression, intravascular granulocyte Anterior Posterior From [ 100 ] aggregation, or both, leading to capillary and arteriolar occlusion facilitating the detection of these hypovascular areas [ 109 ] .",

The ability to screen the entire body is particularly important for many such cases. The optimal choice of radiotracer again depends on the duration of infection (Fig. 4.17 ) . 111 In-labeled white blood cells are the most specifi c for acute infections, but false-positive results have been reported with some tumors, swallowed infected sputum, GI bleeding, and sterile infl ammation. False-negative results have been reported in infections present for more than 2 weeks. More rarely, such false-negative results occur for infections present for only 1 week. Gallium-67 is less specifi c than labeled WBCs, as it is taken up by many tumors and by sterile infl ammation. Several radiolabeled antibody preparations and a radiolabeled antibacterial agent have been introduced and evaluated, but none of these have been used widely. Labeled antibody scintigraphy uses antigranulocyte agents, most commonly intact murine immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against normal Fig. 4 .14 Gallium-67 images of an AIDS patient with a 5-week history of fever.

It is clear that no single technique is ideal in all situations. The choice depends on several factors, including whether localizing signs are present, the site of possible infection, whether anatomy is normal or altered by surgery or trauma, the duration of symptoms and signs, and the presence of other underlying diseases such as cancer. For physicians, understanding the pathophysiological changes is crucial for deciding on an appropriate diagnostic strategy. Understanding pathophysiological changes also helps the nuclear physician to recognize and explain the scintigraphic patterns of infl ammatory conditions (Table 4 .7 summarizes common examples). Further evaluation of PET in diagnosis, localizing, and follow-up of infl ammations is a current interest. The discovery of new radiopharmaceuticals that will be ideal for more specifi c imaging of infl ammation is an important topic for future research.
