The adjusted relative risks of recurrent bleeding for the gastric ulcer were 6.50 (1.52\u201327.75) from the 4th to the 14th day and 5.33 (1.63\u201317.49) from the 4th to the 28th day (p < 0.01 and 0.001, respectively). For the Forrest classification, these rates were 11.0 (2.68\u201345.07) from the 4th to the 14th day and 12.5 (3.07\u201350.83) from the 4th to the 28th day (p < 0.001, Table 4). The Kaplan\u2013Meier curves showed that the proportion of patients free from recurrent bleeding from the 4th to the 28th day was lower in the Rockall scores \u2265 6 group than in the Rockall scores < 6 group (p = 0.01, log-rank test, Fig. 2).",

There are endoscopic features proven to be correlated with an increased risk of recurrent bleeding, including gastric ulcer, ulcer size, the Forrest classification, gastroscopic therapy, and the ulcer location, where the efficacy of endoscopic hemostasis is limited [18]. In this study, the endoscopic features of the patients at the primary endoscopy were similar between the two groups, with the exception of gastric ulcers and the Forrest classification (Table 3). All enrolled patients received endoscopic hemostasis at the primary endoscopy to treat their major SRH according to clinical practice guidelines [15\u201319] and all of the major SRH had been fading to the Forrest IIc lesion after intravenous PPI infusion for 48\u201372 h. The recurrent bleeding rate of an ulcer with the Forrest IIc lesion is only 0\u201313% [3]; nevertheless, the particularly striking finding of this study was that the rates of recurrent peptic ulcer bleeding from the 4th to the 28th day were 24.3% (ITT) and 10.2% (PP) in the Rockall scores \u2265 6 group but only 4.3% (ITT) and 0% (PP) in the Rockall scores < 6 group even though ulcers presented with the IIc lesion (p = 0.001 by ITT and 0.01 by PP, respectively, Table 4).

Our results are highly original in terms of showing an increased risk of recurrent bleeding among patients with both Rockall scores \u2265 6 on arrival and a Forrest IIc lesion at the second-look endoscopy and suggest a potential indication to apply endoscopic therapy tailored to such a patient. A previous study showed that pre-emptive PPI before endoscopy accelerates the resolution of SRH but does not decrease the risk of recurrent bleeding; however, endoscopic therapy for ulcers with the Forrest IIc was not performed in that study [21]. Our findings provide new insights into who may be indicated for endoscopic therapy for ulcers with the Forrest IIc lesion after pre-emptive PPI.",

An imbalance between aggressive factors and the defensive mechanisms is responsible for peptic ulcers [22]. In this study, patients with Rockall scores \u2265 6 were older, had comorbidities, or had higher rates of hemodynamic instability on arrival (p < 0.05); however, they had lower rates of H. pylori infection than those with Rockall scores < 6 (p = 0.03, Table 2). These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of peptic ulcers in patients with Rockall scores \u2265 6 may be due to an impaired defensive mechanism, i.e., the mucus\u2013bicarbonate barrier, more than aggressive factors, i.e., H. pylori [22\u201324]. The secretion of mucus gel and bicarbonate is essential to maintain the mucus\u2013bicarbonate barrier [25, 26], but it is impaired because the perfusion in the gastroduodenal mucosa is compromised in patients with senility, comorbidity, or hemodynamic instability [8, 27]. Mucus and bicarbonate secretions are regulated by prostaglandins [28]; thus, a study of the role of prostaglandins in peptic ulcer disease in patients with Rockall scores \u2265 6 would be a promising direction for future studies. Although the reasons are uncertain, endoscopists could evaluate patients who are at risk of recurrent bleeding more holistically by using the Rockall score than by using the Forrest classification.",

Third, second-look endoscopy may increase the medical cost. Previous studies have shown that endoscopic hemostasis does not provide a significant advantage in ulcers with minor SRH [29\u201331]. Therefore, further studies are needed to validate the role of clinical Rockall scores \u2265 3 to predict the risk of recurrent bleeding and the benefit of endoscopic therapy to reduce risks of ulcers with the Forrest IIc lesion at the primary endoscopy. Moreover, it is also important to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of second-look endoscopy in patients with high Rockall scores \u2265 6.",
