In older children, adolescents, and adults, aerosols should be inhaled by means of the VHC mouthpiece and well-defined respiratory maneuvers designed to maximize deposition of medical aerosol particle (MMAD 1-5 \u03bcm) in the lower respiratory tract.3\n",

However, this is true only if one considers the devices and not the true cost of the longer emergency department and often intensive care unit stay. Recent studies showed a significant cost saving with MDIs/VHCs because patients improved faster, were sent home more quickly, and could be taught in the emergency department to use the MDIs/VHCs, thus decreasing early readmission.4\n,\n5\n",

On April 8, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first generic albuterol inhaler in the United States. This is a major step that promises to make pMDIs/VHCs increasingly favored over SVNs for treating reversible airflow obstruction. It is our view that caregivers worldwide should also adopt the conversion from SVNs to pMDIs/VHCs for bronchodilator therapy.",
