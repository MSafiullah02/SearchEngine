Theoretically, COVID-19 diagnosis may be achieved by salivary diagnostic platforms. Some virus strains have been identified in saliva even until 29 days after infection [30], [31], suggesting that a non-invasive platform to swiftly differentiate the biomarkers using saliva may increase the detection of the disease [32]. Samples of saliva may be obtained as a symptom in patients having oropharyngeal secretions. Given the need for close contact between healthcare personnel and infected patients to obtain nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal samples, the possibility of a saliva self-collection will significantly decrease the chance of COVID-19 transmission. In addition, the collection of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal is not comfortable and may cause bleeding particularly in patients with thrombocytopenia. Just 28 percent of COVID-19 patients produced the sputum of a lower respiratory tract, suggesting a significant limitation as a specimen for diagnostic assessment [24], [33].",
