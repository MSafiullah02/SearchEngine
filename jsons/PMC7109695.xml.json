Review of hospital charts and prior medical records and consultation with the currently treating hospital physician(s) were used to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and to exclude other diagnoses, such as chronic pulmonary disease. Patients were excluded if they had concurrent congestive heart failure or another chronic pulmonary disease that could account for the acute illness or if they had previously been enrolled. Criteria for the diagnosis of acute asthma included confirmation of asthma diagnosis by review of prior records and current admission consistent with asthma disease exacerbation, including currently treating physician clinical diagnosis of asthma, presence of dyspnea, wheezing, and respiratory distress not attributable to another cardiopulmonary process",

The supernatant was removed, except for the final 100 \u03bcL. RNA was extracted from the cells and mucus pellet with TRIzol Reagent (Gibco-BRL; Sigma), as described elsewhere [15]. The RNA was reverse transcribed by use of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of random primers (Promega), as described elsewhere [15]. For the first PCR, a \u201ctouchdown\u201d reaction cycle was used [16, 17]. The primers (upstream, 5\u2032-CGGACACCCAAAGTAG-3\u2032; downstream, 5\u2032-GCACTTCTGTTTCCCC-3\u2032) amplify a 380-bp region in the 5\u2032-untranslated region of picornaviruses, including RVs [15]. The second PCR was performed as described elsewhere [15]. The primers (the same downstream primer as in the first PCR; and RV nested, 5\u2032-GGCAGCCACGCAGGCT-3\u2032) amplify a 202-bp region specific for the RV group. The sizes of the PCR products were verified by agarose electrophoresis; the results were not quantitative and were instead only an indication of the presence or absence of RV. Controls in each PCR run included samples containing reagents with no cDNA and a sample containing cDNA prepared from human RV type 16 (HRVI6) RNA [15\u201317]",

Baseline characteristics were compared using \u03c72 tests (or Fisher\u2019s exact tests) for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon&amp;rank-sum test to compare continuous variables. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were obtained by the use of a generalized estimating equation model to determine independent associations between RV infection at hospitalization and the 3-month follow-up visit, after controlling for baseline characteristics. To achieve adequate regression coefficient power, the first principal component was used to account for the variation of age, current smoking status, and sex as covariates. ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for smoking and use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) were obtained from logistic regression models adjusted for asthma severity. Collinearity was checked and was not found among smoking and use of ICS. Models were additionally adjusted for the first principal component of age, sex, and asthma severity score, but the results did not differ significantly from the model adjusted for asthma severity (data not shown). Tests for interaction between smoking and use of ICSs were performed by calculating the log-likelihood difference between models with and without cross-product terms",

Johnston et al. found that children who required emergency room treatment for asthma were less likely to have had ICSs prescribed than were children with asthma in the same communities who did not require emergency care [11]. ICSs are potent anti-inflammatory agents that have been demonstrated to ameliorate abnormalities of the bronchial epithelium in patients with asthma and of the nasal mucosa in those with allergic rhinitis [28]. Injury to the airway epithelium and a differential phenotype of asthma epithelium are likely to be important risk factors for RV-associated asthma, as demonstrated by differential infection by RV of normal and disrupted or asthmatic airway epithelium [29, 30]. Additionally, studies have shown that ICS use dramatically reduces rates of hospitalization for asthma in children, of which as many as 85% are known to be associated with viral infections [31, 32]",

The increased risk of RV infection in smokers with asthma has biological plausibility, because the role of tobacco smoke as a risk factor for a variety of respiratory infections has been investigated, and cigarette smoking has previously been identified as a risk factor for community-acquired pneumonia [33\u201336]. In addition to being a risk factor for the acquisition of certain respiratory infections, cigarette smoking has also been identified as a risk factor for lower respiratory tract complications of RV infection in a cohort of older adults, 63\u201390 years of age [37]. The experimental evidence to date also suggests that the airway epithelium is a site of damage from smoking, and investigations into the effect of cigarette smoke on the airway epithelium have revealed that chronic smokers have increased air-space epithelial permeability, which could contribute to host susceptibility to infection [38]. In experimental models, RV also more easily infects undifferentiated cells [29]. Additionally, because neutrophils are the predominant inflammatory cell associated with both respiratory viruses and tobacco use, smoking may well be a host factor predisposing to RV-associated asthma exacerbations by priming of lower airway neutrophilic immunopathologic effects [39\u201341]. The findings that as many as 35% of patients with asthma who present to the emergency department with acute asthma smoke tobacco and that 60% of adult asthma exacerbations are associated with viral infections serve to illustrate the importance of understanding the relationship between tobacco smoke and respiratory viral infections in patients with asthma exacerbations [4, 42]",

This interaction between smoking and ICS use deserves further exploration, since ICSs may affect RV-induced illness by restitution of the airway epithelium, as well as modification of host response to virus, and this may be different for smokers and nonsmokers.

First, the study is relatively small and was conducted at a single university medical center, and our findings may not be generalizable to other populations. Other studies have detected higher RV infection prevalences during acute adult asthma exacerbations; however, one other study that used nasal specimens yielded an RV prevalence similar to that in our study, suggesting that the relatively higher rates of viral detection in those investigations may be explained by potential differences in detection rates between nasal and sputum specimens [43]. However, because we used the same methodology to compare patients at both time points, the conclusions drawn should be valid. In addition, we were only able to obtain convalescent specimens from 75% of study patients, including 12 who were RV positive at hospital admission. Although there were no significant differences in general demographic characteristics between study patients who did and those who did not follow-up that would suggest that RV infection rates may be differential, because study patients who did not return for follow-up were more likely to smoke and because smoking appeared to be a characteristic of those with RV infection, convalescent-phase RV infection prevalence could have been underestimated. The prevalence of RV infection at the convalescent follow-up visit (1.3%) was lower than that previously reported for asymptomatic populations, and the single individual in this study in whom it was detected at follow-up had symptoms of a respiratory infection and significantly exacerbated asthma. Previous reports of RV detection in asymptomatic individuals have varied from 10% to 12% in subjects with asthma and from 4% to 35% in subjects without asthma, with studies varying in the length of time that subjects had no upper respiratory tract symptoms preceding sample collection [3, 4, 8, 22]. Three of these studies, however, were performed in children with asthma, and a recent study by Jartti et al. revealed that, after the onset of symptomatic respiratory infection, RV RNA may take 5\u20136 weeks to disappear from the nasopharynx of children admitted with acute respiratory wheezing [44]. Lastly, the etiology of exacerbations in the RV-negative group was not determined, but a large proportion were almost certainly caused by other respiratory viruses, as evidenced by a high prevalence of upper respiratory tract symptoms",

The role of smoking and ICSs in host susceptibility to viral infection in asthma deserves further exploration, since this has significant implications for indications for ICS use and in decreasing severe asthma exacerbations and disease morbidity. The finding that 21% of hospitalizations for severe asthma are associated with RV positivity can be considered significant, in view of the lack of licensed antivirals for RV and the unlikelihood, because of multiple serotypes, of a vaccine being developed. The importance of RV infection in this setting illustrates the need for further research",
