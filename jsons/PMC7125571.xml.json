Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by increased capillary endothelial permeability that leads to segmental accumulation of high protein content in interstitial edema. Fibrin and platelet plugs occlude the microvasculature of the lung and neutrophil sequestration and activation in the interstitium leads to further segmental alveolar damage and flooding. These processes result in decreased pulmonary compliance, compromised gas exchange and extensive intrapulmonary shunting with concomitant ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatching. At present, ARDS is often classified as a continuum of injury ranging from the milder form \u2018acute lung injury (ALI)\u2019 to the more severe form \u2018ARDS\u2019 (Christopher et al., 1999).",

Although the detailed mechanism is still unknown, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has been paid special attention. p38 MAPK is a cytokine-suppressive anti-inflammatory drug target first discovered by Lee et al. (1994). Most reports demonstrate that p38 MAPK is responsible for regulating inflammatory responses (Nick et al., 2000, Nick et al., 2002, Fang et al., 2002). On the other hand, Arcaroli et al. (2001) reported that p38 did not have a central role in the development of ALI after either hemorrhage or endotoxemia. Thus, the role of p38 MAPK in the development of ALI is still uncertained. As a result, p38 MAPK has not been proposed as a valid target for clinical management of ALI/ARDS. In order to examine the role of p38 MAPK in ALI, we then analyzed the expression of p38 MAPK and evaluated the effects of oxymatrine. The expression of p38 MAP kinase was shown using Western blotting analysis. Results showed that phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase was augmented in the oleic acid group compared with the control group, whereas expression of phosphorylated p38 MAP kinase was attenuated in the oxymatrine group compared with the oleic acid group in a concentration-dependent manner. This suggested that the administration of oxymatrine before ALI markedly attenuate the activation of p38 MAP kinase during lung injury. It has been reported that TNF-\u03b1 is augmented via activation of the p38 MAP kinase-related intracellular signal pathway (Johnson et al., 1989, Lee et al., 1994). Oxymatrine markedly attenuated the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and disturbed the mechanism for the production of TNF-\u03b1, thus resulting in the lower serum TNF-\u03b1 level.",
