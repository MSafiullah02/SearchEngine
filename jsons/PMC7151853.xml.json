Because of ethical concerns, humans are not commonly used for experimentation; some common and appropriate laboratory models used are other primates or the closest relatives of the primates, rabbits and rodents. However, the understanding of animal classification that most current adults have been taught in grade school is fundamentally erroneous. Many commonly used terms, such as reptile or lizard, as they are generally interpreted, can lead to misunderstanding of relationships.",

In comparative medicine, understanding what constitutes a monophyletic group is needed to understand relationships and to choose appropriate models. A group that is not monophyletic is called paraphyletic. Paraphyletic groups may not share a common ancestor or may exclude some descendants of the common ancestor. It is illogical to predict that paraphyletic groups would share characteristics that are not in nonmembers. Primates constitute a monophyletic group; when the primates except for humans are referred to, the term nonhuman primates is generally used. This qualification in the term helps the reader understand that a paraphyletic group is being referred to.BOX 3-1DEFINITIONS\n\nAgamids: The clade of lizards containing Bearded Dragons, Water Dragons, Uromastyx sp., and related species. Agamids are members of the larger clade Toxicofera.\nAmniote: The clade of animals who undergo embryonic development in an amnion, consisting of the sauropsids and the mammals. The evolution of the amnion enabled reproduction in arid environments.\nAmphisbaenids: The clade of squamates that are often called Worm Lizards. Many are legless.\nAnguids: The clade of lizards containing Glass Lizards, Alligator Lizards, and related species. Anguids are members of the larger clade Toxicofera.\nArchosaurs: The clade of reptiles whose surviving members are the crocodiles and birds.\nClade: A monophyletic group.\nDefinitive host: A host in which a pathogen has adapted to successfully propagate.\nDinosauria: The clade of reptiles containing the birds. Nonavian dinosaurs went extinct by the end of the Cretaceous period, 65 million years ago.\nHelodermatids: The clade of lizards containing Gila Monsters and Beaded Lizards. Helodermatids are members of the larger clade Toxicofera.\nHomeothermy: The trait of maintaining a constant body temperature, often above that of the environment.\nLacertids: The clade of lizards containing Jeweled Lacertas, Wall Lizards, and related species.\nMonophyletic: Adjective describing a group that contains a common ancestor and all the descendents. A monophyletic group is also known as a clade.\nMutualistic: An ecologic relationship that benefits both organisms involved.\nParaphyletic: Adjective describing a group that is not monophyletic; the group\u2019s members do not share a common ancestor or exclude some descendants of a common ancestor.\nPoikilothermy: The trait of depending on the environment for temperature regulation.\nSauropsid: The clade consisting of the reptiles, including squamates, tuataras, testudines, dinosaurs, and crocodilians. The term reptiles is often misunderstood not to include modern dinosaurs.\nSphenodontid: The reptile clade whose last surviving members are the tuatara in New Zealand.\nSquamate: The clade of reptiles consisting of the lizards (including snakes).\nTeiids: The clade of lizards containing tegus, ameivas, whiptails, caiman lizards, and related species.\nTestudines: The clade of reptiles consisting of the turtles.\nTetrapod: The clade of animals containing all terrestrial vertebrates, including the reptiles, amphibians, and mammals. Along with lungfish and coelacanths, tetrapods are members of the larger clade Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish).\nToxicofera: The clade of lizards that possess venom apparatus, including snakes, iguanids, agamids, chameleons, monitors, helodermatids, and anguids.\n",

The amniotes consist of the reptiles (including birds) and the mammals. The amnion was a major evolutionary advance, enabling the amniotes to have a completely terrestrial life cycle without the need to return to water for reproduction. This is also the first place in tetrapod evolution where common knowledge gives us fundamental errors. Herpetology is the study of nonavian reptiles and amphibians; it does not include mammals and birds. However, nonavian reptiles are far more fundamentally similar to birds and mammals than they are to amphibians, so it is not reasonable to expect nonavian reptile biology to resemble amphibian biology more closely than avian biology or mammalian biology. This is most medically apparent when looking at skin function, respiration, or reproduction.",

Within the sauropsids, the first group to diverge is the squamate (lizards and snakes)/sphenodontid (tuatara) clade. After this, the testudines (turtles) diverged, and the last two major sauropsid groups to diverge were the crocodilians and the dinosaurs, collectively known as the archosaurs. The recognition of dinosaurs as reptiles is widespread in our culture. However, what is not generally recognized is that dinosaurs are not extinct and that birds are the only surviving group of dinosaurs. This is supported both by the fossil record and by sequence data.2 Part of this failure may be due to an erroneous picture of nonavian dinosaurs: they shared a number of traits with birds, including feathers,3 and there is evidence they were warm blooded.4 Nevertheless, although birds themselves constitute a monophyletic group, if birds are not considered to be part of the reptile group, then reptiles are not a monophyletic group. What we really mean by reptiles is sauropsids, and birds are a group of reptiles. The term nonavian reptile should be used if excluding birds from the reptiles, an awkward term indicating a logically awkward paraphyletic group.",

In archosaurs, the right aortic arch is the major outflow.5 Unlike birds, crocodilians have retained their left aortic arch, but the function it serves is primarily to transport hypercapneic blood to the stomach, where it is used to create an extraordinarily low gastric pH.6 Indeed, crocodilians are one of the few groups of animals studied in which oral fluoroquinolones do not result in good blood levels, and it is possible that breakdown in the extremely acidic stomach may play a role in this.7., 8.\n",

Bullfrog tadpoles carrying the pinworm Gyrinicola batrachiensis have better feed conversion and metamorphose earlier than uninfested controls, rendering the relationship mutualistic rather than parasitic.23 However, for parasites with indirect life cycles, causing disease in an intermediate host may be advantageous. If a rodent carrying pentastomid larvae is debilitated, it is more likely to be eaten by a snake, completing the life cycle. This may also result in greater disease in accidental hosts.24 Some parasites do survive well in the environment; this reduces the selective pressure not to harm the host.

Several studies have suggested that wild turtles may have a lower carriage rate for Salmonella.\n33., 34. The only realistic way to reduce the risk of Salmonella in farmed turtles over the long term is to alter the ecologic niche that it inhabits. Keeping farmed animals in high population densities increases contact rates, pathogen loads, and stress, lowering barriers to transmission.

This usually involves latency or chronic infection, with a delicate balance with the host immune system. A larger number of genes is often used to maintain this balance. Because the viruses are larger and more complicated, they require more accurate replication to avoid accumulating lethal mutations. DNA viruses usually have much more accurate replication, with either host or viral proofreading mechanisms in place. Many DNA viruses evolve at rates not much more rapid than their hosts, which enables larger viral genomes with greater numbers of genes. Large DNA viruses, especially those with intranuclear replication, are the most host-specific viruses.38 There is evidence that some of these viruses have codiverged evolutionarily along with their hosts; this evidence is strongest in the adenoviruses and herpesviruses. In Figure 3-3\n, a herpesvirus phylogenetic tree is shown. A potential root can be placed where the arrow is marked, representing an ancestral herpesvirus in an ancestral amniote. The earliest amniote divergence is between mammals and reptiles, as seen in Figure 3-1. All known members of the Betaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae use mammal hosts, and the longer branch lengths in this area indicate that these viruses have diverged over a longer period of time. Heading toward the Alphaherpesvirinae, the first agents to diverge infect squamates; the squamates are the earliest divergence within the reptiles. The next group to diverge is the scutavirus, infecting turtle/tortoise hosts; this is also consistent with host divergence patterns. There are no reliable crocodilian herpesvirus sequences available for comparison. Mardivirus and Iltovirus infect avian hosts. However, the mammalian alphaherpesviruses nest within the clade infecting avian hosts. The branch lengths within the mammalian alphaherpesviruses are relatively short, which indicates that these viruses have not diverged from each other to the same extent that mammalian herpesviruses in the other subfamilies have. One plausible explanation for this is that the mammalian alphaherpesviruses represent a host jump to mammals from the Dinosauria. Chickenpox, caused by the alphaherpesvirus human herpesvirus 3, may be a descendant of a dinosaurian virus and may be more aptly named than had been realized.",

            "text": "Several routine husbandry practices in the reptile trade create strong evolutionary selective pressures toward pathogenicity. First, overcrowding is common. It is unfortunately common and considered acceptable to house snakes in breeder racks, where enclosures that are smaller in dimension than the length of the snake are stored in vertical racks in close proximity. The stress of close confinement results in elevated corticosteroids and immunosuppression .43 The design of these breeder racks makes good biosecurity practices impossible. High population densities lower transmission barriers, reducing pressure to keep hosts alive and selecting toward virulence.44 It is also common in the reptile trade to select for color phases. This usually involves some degree of inbreeding to select for what are often recessive traits. A major driving force for the evolution of sex is acquisition of genetic diversity for immune function. Inbreeding results in selection for greater disease.45 Finally, reptiles are still often wild-caught, and stressed wild-caught animals are brought to large distributors who have species from all over the world in the same facility with insufficient biosecurity. This is an ideal situation for pathogen host jumps, which is where the most dramatic disease is seen.46 Mixing of species by the exotic animal trade has already proved disastrous, with the transferral of monkeypox from Gambian Pouched Rats to Prairie Dogs to humans.47 An orthoreovirus was first isolated in 1996 from a Mediterranean Spur-thighed Tortoise (Testudo graeca) in Switzerland and later characterized by sequencing.48 This virus has more recently been associated with a high mortality rate and syncytial cell enteropathy/hepatopathy in Leopard Geckos widely distributed in the United States.49 This almost certainly represents a host jump at a breeding institution or distributor.",
