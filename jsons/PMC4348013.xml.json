            "text": "Acute respiratory infection illness (also known as the common cold, upper respiratory tract infection, or upper respiratory infection) is an acute infection, generally viral in etiology, involving structures of the upper airways [Simoes et al., 2006]. The most common causative agent is rhinovirus, but several other respiratory viruses are also known to cause acute respiratory illness [Gwaltney, 1985]. Acute respiratory infection is a common occurrence, yet detrimental to well\u2010being. Moreover, there is currently no cure or effective treatment option available [Cohen et al., 1993; Carter, 2002]. Symptoms of acute respiratory infection illness can be examined three\u2010dimensionally in the following groups: nasal, throat, and quality of life [Obasi et al., 2013]. These unpleasant, and sometimes, severe symptoms cause people to miss work and to utilize healthcare services, which places a notable burden on the individual and society [Fendrick et al., 2003; Eccles, 2005; Fiore et al., 2010; Ebell and Afonso, 2011].",

            "text": "For many years, it has been known that some inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin\u20108 (IL\u20108), play a role in the pathophysiology of the common cold, as levels are found to increase in individuals sick with viral rhinitis compared to healthy individuals [Choi and Jacoby, 1992; Becker et al., 1993; Noah et al., 1995; R\u00f6seler et al., 1995; Gern et al., 1996; Johnston et al., 1997; Zhu et al., 1997; Kaul et al., 2000; Parry et al., 2000]. Within the immune system, IL\u20108 acts to recruit and activate neutrophils, contributing to inflammation [Naclerio et al., 1988; Teran et al., 1997; Zeilhofer and Schorr, 2000; Turner, 2001]. However, little work has been done to correlate IL\u20108 concentrations with specific acute respiratory infection symptoms and degree of illness. This paper presents important novel research boasting over 800 common cold cases with biomarkers and detailed records of acute respiratory infection severity making the breadth of our study unique. Additionally, not only is the relationship of the biomarkers with overall illness severity examined, but also more than 20 separate symptoms are considered one by one, and in meaningful clusters, in order to hone in on exactly what the relationship is between inflammatory biomarkers and certain cold symptoms. By investigating the relationship between acute respiratory infection illness severity and inflammatory biomarkers, the intent was to determine whether certain symptoms correlate more closely than others with inflammatory biomarkers such as IL\u20108 and nasal neutrophils. An additional aim was to gain insight into the predictability of overall severity and duration of acute respiratory infection episodes based on change in IL\u20108 and neutrophil levels during the first 3 days of illness.",

In one of the studies, 685 participants returned about 48 hr later to provide a second nasal specimen during their acute respiratory infection. The nasal specimens were used to measure IL\u20108 concentrations and neutrophil counts, and to undergo multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection and identification of respiratory viruses. Throughout the duration of the acute respiratory infection episode participants provided information about their symptoms on a self\u2010report basis using the well\u2010validated Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS\u201021) [Barrett et al., 2002; Barrett et al., 2005; Barrett et al., 2009].

The Jackson score is calculated by summing eight symptom scores (sneezing, headache, malaise, chilliness, nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, sore throat, and cough), where each is rated 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. In the PEP trial, illness episode duration began at enrollment and continued through the last time the participant answered \u201cyes\u201d to, \u201cDo you think you still have a cold?\u201d To confirm that the illness had ended, the last \u201cyes\u201d answer had to be followed by a \u201cno\u201d answer for two days in a row. Monitoring was limited to a maximum of 14 days. In the MEPARI trial, the beginning of each acute respiratory infection illness episode was determined by the defining criteria described above. The last day of the illness episode was the last day the participant rated illness severity higher than 0 in response to \u201cHow sick do you feel today?\u201d on the WURSS instrument.

The WURSS\u201021 contains one item rating overall illness severity (How sick do you feel today?); 10 items rating cold symptoms (runny nose, plugged nose, sneezing, sore throat, scratchy throat, cough, hoarseness, head congestion, chest congestion, feeling tired); nine items rating how much the cold episode has interfered with function and quality of life (think clearly; sleep well; breathe easily; walk, climb stairs, exercise; accomplish daily activities; work outside the home; work inside the home; interact with others; live your personal life); and one item rating daily change (Compared to yesterday, I feel that my cold is\u2026).

            "text": "The elevation of certain biomarkers, such as IL\u20108, during acute respiratory infection has been most studied in rhinovirus infection. Several authors have reported a direct correlation between the severity of symptoms associated with in vitro rhinovirus infection and the concentration of interleukin\u20108 in nasal secretions. Biagioli et al. examined the mechanism of rhinovirus\u2010induced IL\u20108 response and suggested that mediation occurs through production of oxidative species and the subsequent activation of NF\u2010kappaB [Biagioli et al., 1999]. That study was carried out in vitro. The current study supports that study's findings and is more clinically applicable, as infections were naturally community\u2010acquired and are correlated with symptom severity. Global severity, measured by AUC, was found to correlate with biomarker concentrations of IL\u20108 and neutrophils. Gern and colleagues report IL\u20108 production contributes to acute respiratory infection symptom severity in children with rhinovirus or influenza A infection [Gern et al., 2002]. While this study used a different symptom scale, it too found that IL\u20108 correlated with acute respiratory infection severity when all the acute respiratory infection episodes reported in the studied adult population are considered. Among these 811 episodes, nine types of viruses were identified. An analysis by viral type was tried, but once divided by virus the number of acute respiratory infection episodes in each group had insufficient power to draw conclusions.",

The recent goal, however, was to hone in on the specific symptoms, or groups of symptoms that correlate most closely with IL\u20108 and neutrophils. The results highlight rhinitis related symptoms, and these findings are supported by the literature. One study examined the association between experimental rhinovirus infection and the elaboration of IL\u20108 into nasal secretions, and also looked at rhinovirus\u2010associated common cold symptoms [Turner et al., 1998]. They found IL\u20108 concentrations were significantly higher in infected symptomatic subjects compared to infected asymptomatic or placebo\u2010infected subjects. More specifically, there was a correlation between severity of nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea with the change in IL\u20108 concentration from baseline to 2\u20134 days after virus challenge.",

Neutrophils correlated with scratchy throat and two quality of life symptoms: thinking clearly and sleeping well. The scratchy throat correlation with IL\u20108 and neutrophils could be explained as a result of postnasal drip triggered by acute respiratory infection. The correlation between neutrophils and sleep quality is an interesting issue. Healthy individuals who are sleep deprived are known to have increased neutrophils [Boudjeltia et al., 2008; Ruiz et al., 2012]. Similarly, night shift workers have been found to have increased levels of inflammatory markers, including neutrophils, compared to individuals who work day shift [Alireza et al., 2011]. Additionally, individuals with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) have a higher percentage of sputum neutrophils compared to normal controls [Lacedonia et al., 2011]. All of these examples imply that the poor sleep leads to the neutrophil increase. However, during an acute respiratory infection the neutrophils are likely due to the infection, which leads to poor sleep quality. Nasal symptoms due to neutrophil infiltrated non\u2010allergic rhinitis have been shown to have a large effect on sleep quality and quality of life [Gelardi et al., 2008]. Even though the participants we studied exhibit a different disease state than sleep apnea, it shows an important and consistent relationship between nasal symptoms and sleep quality. Likely, the poor sleep quality is due to nasal neutrophils, but our study does not allow us to determine if the poor sleep quality is a result of the nasal neutrophils, or if the nasal neutrophils are a result of the poor sleep quality.",

            "text": "An important remaining question concerns the role of cytokines and cells in the clearance of acute respiratory infection virus in humans compared to the mediation of symptoms. IL\u20108 has been shown to be linked to clearance of a porcine respiratory virus [Lunney et al., 2010], and one study suggests that neutrophils do not play an important role in viral clearance during influenza virus infection in mice [Wareing et al., 2007]. Furthermore, investigators have run human experiments that attempt to determine predictability of acute respiratory infection severity or duration. One group of researchers asked clinicians and patients to predict the severity and duration of acute respiratory infection at an initial visit and had the patient complete the WURSS [Longmier et al., 2013]. There was no significant association found between participant and clinician predictions of severity or duration with the actual severity and duration of acute respiratory infection. In order to answer a similar question about predictability of cold severity, time\u2010points analysis that looked at IL\u20108 and neutrophil levels on Day 1 of the acute respiratory infection episode was performed in relationship to WURSS score on Day 3 of the acute respiratory infection episode. The analysis gave insignificant results. Therefore, while IL\u20108 is indicative of inflammation, it may not be a mediator affecting the chronological course of colds. Further research is necessary to determine if the concentration or change in concentration of cytokines throughout an acute respiratory infection episode can predict the overall duration and severity of the illness. For example, specimens from additional time points could be assayed, and a larger array of cytokines could be measured in order to create a better model of the importance of cells and cytokines for the mediation of symptoms and the control of viral replication. This insight could be useful for prevention and treatment options focusing on shortening the length of a cold, and abating symptoms.",

Additionally, both correlate with scratchy throat. Finally, within the quality of life group, neutrophils correlated with thinking clearly and sleeping well, while IL\u20108 negatively correlated with how participants responded to a question gauging overall symptom improvement. While it has been known for years that cytokines like IL\u20108 are involved in the disease process of acute respiratory infection illnesses, and while it is not surprising that the symptoms that correlate most closely with IL\u20108 and neutrophils from nasal specimens are nasal symptoms, this relationship has not been well documented in detail, until now. With these findings, knowing more about acute respiratory infection symptomology and its relationship with inflammatory biomarkers opens doors to discovering more effective curative treatment methods and potential medications for the amelioration of unpleasant and burdensome symptoms.",
