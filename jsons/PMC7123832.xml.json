For instance, thermal image is an effective indicator for the diagnosis of breast cancer [1], peripheral vascular disorders [2], diabetes [1], fever screening [3] etc. In particular, it has been successfully applied to mass screening of febrile travelers at many quarantine stations of international airports after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 [4\u20138].",

However, quarantine screening by self-reporting questionnaires related to medical state do not provide accurate rate of infected individuals and true symptoms of those infected with epidemic diseases. For this reason, IRT was proposed for noncontact and rapid monitoring of body temperature for mass screening of international travelers. The usefulness of IRT for mass screening has been evaluated in many recent studies; its sensitivity varies from 40 to 89.4% under various circumstances [9\u201311].",

Our results indicated that IRT sufficiently detected febrile individuals and its detection accuracy was improved by corroborating surveillance with self-reporting questionnaires. However, there are several limitations associated with the use of IRT for fever screening. IRT deterred inspectors from utilizing due to its unreliability originated from following three causes:(i)Individual-related causes would alter body surface temperatures. Internal causes such as water and alcohol consumption, pregnancy, estrus cycle, and hormone treatment would increase body temperature and external causes such as sweat and thick makeup would decrease body temperature. In addition, glasses and hats would cover the parts used for detection and body movements while scanning would result in unsuccessful image extraction.(ii)Machine parameters may be influenced by factors such as ambient temperature, humidity, air ventilation, and performance differential.(iii)Staff alternation would result in differences in judgment of images; these will be due to untrained or inexperienced inspectors, setting of inaccurate cutoff body surface temperature, and incorrect distance between the subject and IRT equipment.\n",

If a person is infected, not only the body temperature but also heart and respiration rates will invariably increase. Thus, our system automatically detects infected individuals within 10 s by a discriminant function using the measured vital signs. Heart and respiration rates are determined using microwave radar in a noncontact manner, and facial skin temperature is monitored through IRT. By adding heart and respiration rates as the new screening parameters, our infection screening system provides higher sensitivity than that of using only IRT.",

However, facial skin temperature measured through IRT can be affected by many factors, such as antifebrile and alcohol intake, and ambient temperatures. Specifically, taking antifebrile medication results in rapid modification of body temperature and directly affects the efficiency of IRT. In order to achieve more accurate infection screening, we have developed an infection screening system, which monitors infection-induced alternation of heart and respiration rates as well as body temperature in a noncontact manner in our previous studies. The idea of using vital signs stems from the fact that infectious diseases are associated with inflammation and the increased rates of body temperature, heart, and respiration are included in the diagnostic criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (Table 1) [17]. One of the criteria for infection is the white blood cell (WBC) count; however, this requires blood samples, which precludes its use as a fast and efficient screening parameter.\n",

Data from all subjects was used to construct an ASCII file, which contained four columns, i.e., three parameters and one label. Whereas the scale of the parameters is important in determining the nature of SOM, we normalized all the parameters using the logarithmic scale. After preprocessing of the input layer, the ASCII file was used to create various SOM clusters. The SOM clustering result was visualized on a two-dimensional color-coded map using the unified distance matrix (U-matrix). The U-matrix shows the distance between neighboring map units by a color tone. This classification is composed of various clusters corresponding to a variety of U-matrix distances (color tone). Second, the k-means clustering algorithm was employed to reduce the SOM clusters into two clusters (\u201cPotential infection group\u201d and \u201cNormal group\u201d).\n",

IRT is efficient in detecting infected passengers or those who come in contact with infected individuals in early seasons of epidemic; IRT will play an important role in avoiding the spread of infections with unclear characteristics. The benefits of implementing IRT for quarantine purposes can be summarized as follows:(i)Fever at entry will be recorded and the collected data will be used as a reference in other fields of medicine.(ii)Questionnaires can be highly reliable when conducted with thermal scanning that detects feverish passengers who were negligent in reporting their symptoms in the questionnaires. By excluding passengers in the early stages or incubation period of infection, active border control can be reinforced and these precautionary measures will prevent infection from spreading within the country.\n",
