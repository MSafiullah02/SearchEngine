Moreover, pollutants in the air are significant underlying contributors to the emergence of respiratory viral infections 13 . In particular, PM 10 and PM 2.5 have been linked to respiratory disease hospitalisations for pneumonia and chronic pulmonary diseases [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . There is some further experimental evidence that emissions from diesel and coal affect the lungs, causing pathological immune response and inflammations 21, 22 , wiping away past disputes 23 that only high concentrations of these gasses were needed to cause pathologies. Airborne microorganisms can directly infect other people's mucosae or travel further into the air and onto surfaces causing delayed infections. The particles of several pollutants such as PMs and NO2 can act as a vector for the spread and extended survival in the air of bioaerosols [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] including viruses [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . A first hypothesis in this direction has arisen for COVID-19 in Northern Italy 35,36granted that the viral load in a flying aggregate can be enough to cause morbidity.",

The countries should not be compared in respect to mortality rate due to different administration sizes. Figure 1 reports comparison maps of COVID-19 distributions with the satellite-based PM 2.5 concentrations for the eight analysed countries. These graphical representations also allow a rapid assessment of the air pollution pattern in each country (basic descriptive statistics for each pollutant can be found in S.I., Table S2 ). While the PM 2.5 maps are continuous surfaces drawn following the same classification scheme across countries, the COVID-19 infections and deaths maps required ad-hoc classification adaptations due to different population profiles and infection dynamics. In China, due to the very large population and an apparently effective policy for the containment of the virus, the number of cases per 100,000 residents were relatively low and highly concentrated in the epicentre of the outbreak (Wuhan and the Hubei province). A visual correlation between the two maps can be perceived, especially between the eastern and western parts of the country. In the United States, due to a higher correlation with PM 2.5, we chose to represent COVID-19 deaths instead of cases. Here the virus noticeably appears spread over several areas. PM 2.5 differences are not large, but their distribution looks adequately coincident with the fatalities. The high correlation results found for Italy are clearly visible.

The absence of correlation found in Spain may be attributed to the minimal difference of average PM 2.5 and NO2 levels among its provinces (S. I. Table S1 ). Despite these small variations, air pollution appears to be correlated with population density (S. I. Table S2 ), while COVID-19 had a higher incidence in less populated areas (Table 2 and 3). One hypothesis of this particular configuration could be an effect of the people's reaction to the spread of the virus.

This has led to a decrease in air pollution, which in China likely prevented the deaths of 4,000 children under 5 and 73,000 adults over 70 61 . However, the winter months and low temperature caused people to keep at least domestic heating systems on, maintaining a certain amount of emissions. In Europe 62 and in China 63 a consistent reduction in air pollution was recorded by satellites due to reduced anthropogenic activities during the lockdowns, although it occurred gradually 64, 65 , also due to weather conditions unfavourable to air quality. The quarantines certainly decreased the role that commuting has in the virus spread. Nonetheless, reduced anthropogenic activities and reduced mobility lose correlational significance over time, after the first stages of the infection 37 . Instead, the correlation we found with low air quality remains significant throughout the different epidemic stages.",
