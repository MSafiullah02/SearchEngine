A history was taken of smoking habits (years of smoking, current smoking status). Patients were asked about chronic symptoms of dyspnea, sputum production, wheeze, and cough defined as occurring either all day or every morning when stable (exacerbation free). They were also asked about their long-term inhaled and oral steroid use, and a history of cardiovascular comorbidities noted. The study had ethics approval from the Ethics Committee of the East London and City Health Authority, and the patients provided written informed consent.",

Exacerbation onset was identified as the first of \u2265 2 consecutive days with increase in either two or more major symptoms, or any one major symptom plus any minor symptom. Symptoms recorded continuously in the 5-day period preceding onset were disregarded in this diagnostic process to exclude occasional false exacerbations in a few patients who until reeducated reported the presence rather than an increase in a symptom. Exacerbations for which no diary card symptoms were recorded by the patient were identified from hospital admission notes for an acute exacerbation of COPD or by questioning patients about treatment from their general practitioners at clinic visits. Patients with any deterioration of symptoms were encouraged to contact the clinical team by a dedicated and manned telephone line, and approximately 50% of exacerbations were seen in the clinic, generally within 48 h, at which time lung function was measured prior to treatment. Exacerbations were treated with antibiotics and/or steroids, depending on the presence of increased sputum volume or purulence, and the severity as assessed by the clinical team.",

At different times during the study period, at exacerbation and nonexacerbation visits, sputum was collected for bacteria, airway cytokines (interleukin [IL]-8 and IL-6) and cell counts, and blood for plasma fibrinogen estimation. Figure 1\nshows that sputum IL-6 samples were obtained at intervals throughout the study, while neutrophil counts were recorded over 4 years. Fibrinogen samples were collected around year 2 (1997) and year 6 (2001) as shown in Figure 1. Few patients (43 of 148) had two or more stable sputum IL-8 determinations, and the intervening time for these was too short for a reliable estimation of any longitudinal change.",

These procedures are designed for panel (cohort) data and are particularly useful when data are correlated, as in repeated-measures designs and when there are complex error structures.22 The general linear mixed model was used throughout except for the cytokine data, for which a poisson-shaped distribution was allowed for, or chronic symptoms, for which a binomial distribution was allowed for. Each parameter (as a dependent variable) was regressed against two independent variables: one was time of sampling from the start of study, and the other was a binary variable for whether the dependent variable was measured during an exacerbation or not.",

FEV1 percentage of predicted (FEV1%Pred) was measured at the start of the study and every 3 months after. The predicted FEV1 used was recorded at recruitment and calculated from the age, sex, and height of the patients. As in the longitudinal analysis, we included as independent variables time and whether or not FEV1%Pred was measured during an exacerbation as two of the four independent variables. The third variable was whether or not the parameter, if measured on a continuous scale, was less or greater than or equal to the cohort median, or whether the patient was male or female, or whether they smoked or not, or had a chronic symptom or not. The fourth independent variable was an interaction term obtained as the product of first and third variables. This interaction term allowed us to test whether FEV1%Pred decline was faster in the group with the greater inflammation, pathogen presence, or particular characteristic. By splitting the cohort using the median, we created groups of equal size, thus avoiding bias and the need to establish normal clinically acceptable levels for these biomarkers. We used the earliest stable (nonexacerbation) measurement recruitment characteristic to dichotomize the patients into the two groups; therefore, we as much as possible prospectively examined the effect of these parameters on FEV1%Pred decline. Our findings were not substantially changed if an average value for stable samples collected throughout the study was used to dichotomize the patients into the two groups.",

We found that frequent exacerbators with an exacerbation frequency of > 2.52 exacerbations per year were more likely to show a faster rise in plasma fibrinogen and sputum IL-6 over time than patients with a history of infrequent exacerbations. Two studies4\n5 now show that frequent exacerbators have a more rapid decline in lung function. Thus, we suggest that the mechanism by which these acute events contribute to the chronic deterioration in FEV1 decline is by causing a faster rate of rise in airway inflammation. This is consistent with the higher sputum IL-6 and IL-8 levels in stable (nonexacerbating) patients who have a history of frequent exacerbations compared to those with infrequent exacerbations.8 The elevated systemic inflammatory response in the frequent exacerbators suggests that this group may be particularly prone to muscle weakness with increasing disease severity and thus they may be an important group to target for pulmonary rehabilitation. The faster rise in plasma fibrinogen in the frequent exacerbators also suggests that these patients may be the group of COPD patients most at risk from cardiovascular disease.",

It is also likely that these anti-inflammatory therapies will be most effective in patients with frequent exacerbations. There is evidence from the Inhaled Steroids in Obstructive Lung Disease in Europe study37 that inhaled steroids showed the greatest benefit on exacerbations in those COPD patients with a higher exacerbation frequency. Data from a meta-analysis38 show that probably inhaled steroids have a small effect on FEV1 decline and this effect on decline may be a consequence of the reduction in exacerbations. We also found that patients with a high starting FEV1%Pred had a faster decline. This is contrary to the conventional idea that a high FEV1 is due to a slow decline and a low FEV1 to a fast decline. In their landmark monograph, Fletcher et al39 cautioned against this assumption. A slower decline in the group of patients with very severe COPD may in part be due to a survival effect, with faster decliners absent due to death and the use of intensive therapy in the latter stages of the disease.",

The limitations of our study need to be discussed. Firstly, for many patients, the initial microbial and inflammatory marker samples used to differentiate the patients into the high and low groupings were obtained at different times, with respect to the calendar date and time elapsed from recruitment, when and if they were able to produce sufficient sputum for analysis. The use of samples that were not collected at commencement of the study is not a serious drawback, as our primary outcome measure\u2014annual decline in FEV1%Pred\u2014should be the same before or after the date of sampling, assuming a linear decline over the period the patients were investigated. It is possible that patients transferred from the low to the high grouping during the study; however, any bias from this would be to make it less likely that a significant difference would exist between the high and low groups. Secondly, our data set is incomplete because\u2014like all cohort studies\u2014there are unavoidable dropouts. We found no difference in the confounders or inflammatory markers of patients who died or withdrew from the study (data not shown). In addition, the inflammatory markers were not all available on every patient. This prevented us performing an analysis that included more than one inflammatory marker at any one time.",
