A secondary objective is to evaluate the necessity of developing age-or gender-specific HRQoL instruments. Methods: We explored the meaning of general and health-related QoL through focus group discussions in Singapore, a multi-ethnic Asian society. Two investigators independently analysed the data. They extracted major and sub-themes related to both general and health-related QoL. The agreement between the analyses was compared and disagreement was resolved through discussion. Results: Thirty-two subjects (children: 50.0%, female: 50.0%) participated. There were few disagreements. Meanings of general and health-related QoL could be grouped under three broad themes: (1) physical, (2) psychological and (3) social health, consistent with the current definition of HRQoL. We found that Singaporean and Western children/adolescents share a remarkably similar notion of general and health-related QoL. Compared to adolescents, children were more likely to report positive emotions, be less mindful of others' opinions and had less varied social activities. Conclusion: The results suggest that currently available instruments are potentially useful for Singaporean children/adolescents. We also found that age-specific HRQoL instruments are necessary.",

            "text": "Generally, there are three main approaches to the development of HRQoL instruments for children and adolescents. In the first approach, instruments for children and adolescents were adapted from existing instruments for adults. Given that children and adults have different life experiences and priorities and therefore do not necessarily share the same meaning of health and illness, this approach is likely to be of limited value [5] , unless the developers make conscientious effort to ensure that the contents are valid (i.e. meaningful) and the instruments are reliable (i.e. consistent) for assessment of child HRQoL. The third approach, which we shall discuss later, will be particularly useful for assessing content validity. In the second approach, opinions of 'experts' were sought to select items considered important to children and adolescents for constructing the HRQoL instruments. This approach shares the same limitations as the first in that the choice of items by adult 'experts' is likely to be colored by their own values, experiences and expectations [5] . The last and most desirable approach involves children themselves, sometimes together with parents and healthcare professionals. Unfortunately, few developers have taken this approach. In this approach, children and adolescents were asked directly to report or discuss issues that are important to them. For example, the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index was developed by asking 169 children and adolescents aged 3-16 years to write down, with help from parents when required, how their skin disease affected their lives. However, this study did not allow for group interactions, which are useful for understanding complex behaviors and motivations behind ideas [6] . Three studies that employed the focus group methodology, which allows for group interaction, in design of HRQoL instruments for children and adolescents were identified. Cramer et al. [7] developed the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory for Adolescents (QOLIE -A) through focus group discussion with adolescents [7] . Content validity of QOLIE-A was reported based on the observation that comments derived from focus group discussions did not reveal new content areas that were not already covered in the questionnaire. However, as the contents used in the focus group are largely derived from adult QoL instruments, framing effects may be of concern here [5] . The Canadian Haemophilia Outcomes -Kids Life Assessment Tool was also developed based on items elicited from focus group discussion involving children and their parents [8] . However, the number of subjects in that study was relatively small. The European KIDSCREEN Group is the largest identified study which involved both sick and healthy children in focus group discussions during the development of HRQoL questionnaires [9] .",

Morgan defined the focus group as a research technique that collects data through group interaction on a topic determined by the researcher [6] . An important feature of the focus group approach is the 'group effect' where interactions between participants give rise to more information than can be obtained from multiple individual interviews. For a detailed discussion of the inherent strength and limitations of the focus group methodology, readers are referred to the work by Morgan [6] . However, the application of focus group as a research tool in the field of HRQoL is still in its infancy. Eiser and Morse [5] commented that current focus group studies that involved children tended to be poorly described with little detail about how the content of discussion is transformed into questionnaire items. Clearly, better designed studies are needed to demonstrate the value of focus group discussion as a useful tool in constructing HRQoL instruments.",

The extent to which these instruments are useful in Asian children and adolescents remains to be determined. It is a fact that Asians and Westerners view health differently. For example, in East Asia, health is viewed as the maintenance of a balance between Yin and Yang in the body and that illness is a result of an imbalance [11, 12] . However, in the west, illness is perceived as a consequence of an external force, such as a virus or bacteria, or a slow degeneration of the functional ability of the body. As a result, the two cultures may conceptualize HRQoL very differently. Hence, the first objective of this study is to evaluate the extent to which instruments developed based on a Western notion of health are useful among children and adolescents in an Asian country. In addition, some instrument developers designed different age versions of the HRQoL instruments to cater to developmental differences [13] [14] [15] [16] . Boys and girls also undergo significant developmental differences. However, we are not aware of any gender-specific HRQoL instruments for children/adolescents, although such instruments are available in the adults. Hence, the second objective of this study is to evaluate the need to develop separate versions of the questionnaire for children/adolescents and boys/girls.",

The moderator also informed the participants that he or she may refuse to answer any questions or stop the interview at any time, that interviews would be anonymous and confidential and that he or she had complete freedom of expression. The session begun with a general question, ''In your opinion, what is important for you in your everyday life to make you feel well?'' and respondents were allowed to talk until no new views were expressed. Throughout the discussion, interference from moderator was kept to the minimal and limited to preventing the participants from digression. The sessions were video-and audio-taped to facilitate content analysis. The reason for recording the interview was communicated to the participants. An abridged transcription of the audio tape recording was carried out by the moderator. The exact expressions used by the participants were conserved in the transcripts.

Some said life was boring as it was preoccupied with lessons and schoolwork. Many participants also felt depressed when they did not perform well in their examinations. Several participants described that conflicts with family members and restrictions of freedom made them unhappy. One of the groups lamented about social insecurity brought about by terrorism and the recent severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic.

The Singapore healthcare system is benchmarked against the British and the U.S. systems and is rated as the sixth most effective healthcare system in the world [20] . At the same time, traditional medicine and Asian philosophy of health is deeply entrenched in the lives of Singaporeans. If the notion of HRQoL in Singaporean children and adolescents were found to be very different from Western children and adolescents, the difference will likely be amplified in other Asian countries.

The cate-gories and item meanings within each domain ( Table 2) were also strikingly similar to the contents of currently available generic HRQoL instruments for children and adolescents [22] , although minor and important differences exist. Hence, our findings suggest an exciting possibility that existing HRQoL instruments for children and adolescent are potentially useful in the Asian population. A primary concern in the use of HRQoL instruments across different cultures is the issue of conceptual equivalence [23] . The issue of whether the two different cultures conceptualize HRQoL similarly needs to be addressed before meaningful translation or adaptation of the instruments can take place. This study has thus provided empirical support for cross-cultural adaptation of existing HRQoL instruments for children and adolescents in an Asian country, rather than reinventing the wheel to develop new instruments.",

For example, younger children had limited discussion of subjective dimensions of QoL, emphasizing more on the physical aspects of QoL [24] . In addition, certain words carry different connotations for children and adolescents, e.g. fear and future. The immediate social context surrounding children and adolescents were also found to be different, with the latter having a wider social circle. With respect to the observation that children use positive descriptions more often than adolescents, a related finding was made in an earlier study where Singaporean children were found to have better QoL than adolescents [26] . A possible explanation de-rived from the focus group discussions was that academic pressure took a greater toll on adolescents than children. Our findings thus support the current practice of developing HRQoL instruments catered for different age groups [13] [14] [15] . However, further research is needed to understand the influence of developmental changes on HRQoL. For example, in longitudinal studies evaluating effectiveness of programs or interventions to improve health status, expected improvements in HRQoL may not be observed if changes that have occurred in the transition from childhood to adolescents diminished HRQoL. This phenomenon is known as response shift. Sprangers and Schwartz defined response shift as a change in the meaning of one's self-evaluation of a target construct as a result of (a) a change in the respondents' internal standards of measurement, (b) a change in the respondents values or (c) a redefinition of the target construct [27] . Developmental changes may contribute to any of the three components of response shift. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which the process of growing up actually changes an individual's internal standards of measurement, values and conceptualization of QoL.",

The merit of this approach lies in its generalizability to the general population since health concepts were directly elicited from the population of interest.

However, as quality of life is a developing research field in this country, people with knowledge in both focus group and QoL are hard to come by. To ensure the highest data quality, our moderator was trained in using an established protocol and mock focus group discussions were performed before the actual study. Second, the sample was selective. We left it to the principals, teachers or persons-incharge to select the participants. This potentially could introduce bias. Nevertheless, we did achieve a good mix in terms of ethnicity and socioeconomic background (based on the type of family dwelling). Third, by including participants of different ethnicities, we are assuming that there are no cultural differences in the conceptualization of HRQoL among these ethnic groups. This assumption needs to be tested in future studies. However, during the course of analysis, we did not observe any blatant differences in the discussion by participants of different ethnicities.",

Younger children are likely to be limited in their ability to express themselves clearly in writing. Hence, the focus group methodology will be very useful in this instance. In addition, it will be useful to involve parents in focus group discussions on QoL so that we can gain a better understanding of the points of departure between parents' and their children's conceptualization of QoL. This would give us a better appreciation of the proxy problem mentioned earlier in the introduction. Furthermore, we would suggest expanding the focus group discussions to children with chronic illnesses. In this study, we have recruited children from the general population, which was necessary because discussions involving only sick children are likely to be biased towards those areas of health that were impaired by their medical conditions. For example, sick children are likely to experience pain and discomfort more than healthy children. In future studies involving sick children, this bias may potentially be reduced by involving groups of sick children representative of the local epidemiology of childhood diseases. Doing so would however incur substantial time and resources, which is not always feasible. Nevertheless, this is certainly worth pursuing in the future.",

This suggests an exciting possibility of a 'universal' concept of HRQoL among Asian and Western children and adolescents. However, this needs to be determined in a larger sample in Singapore as well as in other Asian countries which are less westernised compared to Singapore. In addition, minor but important differences were found in the weights that our study participants assigned to the three broad domains of QoL (physical, psychological and social) in the presence or absence of illness. It will be interesting to study if the same differences would be observed in other Asian study samples. Future focus group discussion could also be extended to younger children and parents with children in childhood or adolescence.",
