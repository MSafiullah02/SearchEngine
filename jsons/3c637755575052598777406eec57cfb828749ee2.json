Here, we evaluated pathogenesis and host transcription in response to infection 20 with murine coronaviruses encoding independent mutations in two different viral antagonists: the 21 deubiquitinase (DUB) within nonstructural protein 3 and the endoribonuclease (EndoU) within 22 nonstructural protein 15. The virus with reduced ability to deubiquitinate proteins, herein termed 23 the DUBmut virus, was engineered via X-ray structure-guided mutagenesis and activates an earlier 24 interferon response than the wild type virus. However, the replication kinetics of DUBmut in 25 cultured cells are similar to wild type virus and pathogenesis in mice is also similar to what was 26 observed during infection with wild type virus. On the other hand, we previously reported that an 27 EndoUmut virus containing an inactivated endoribonuclease activity elicited rapid and robust 28 activation of type I interferon, which limited virus replication and pathogenesis. Here, using a 29 transcriptomics approach, we compared the scope and kinetics of the host response to the wild 30 type, DUBmut, and EndoUmut viruses in infected macrophages. We found that the EndoUmut 31 virus activates a focused response, predominantly involving type I interferons and a subset of 32 interferon-responsive genes, within 12 hours after infection. In contrast, the wild type and 33 DUBmut viruses stimulate upregulation of over 2,800 genes, including activation of unfolded 34 protein response (UPR) pathways and a proinflammatory profile associated with viral 35 pathogenesis. This study highlights the role of viral interferon antagonists in shaping the kinetics 36 and magnitude of the host response during virus infection and demonstrates that inactivation of a 37 dominant viral antagonist, the coronavirus endoribonuclease, dramatically alters the host response 38 in macrophages and the disease process.",

In turn, coronaviruses encode proteins that mitigate the cell's ability to 44 detect virus replication or amplify the interferon response. Here, we evaluated the host macrophage 45 response to two independent mutant coronaviruses: one with a reduced deubiquitinating activity 46 (DUBmut), and the other containing an inactivated endoribonuclease (EndoUmut). We observed 47 a rapid, robust, and focused response to the EndoUmut virus, which was characterized by enhanced 48 expression of interferon and interferon-stimulated genes. These results indicate that coronaviruses 49 utilize EndoU activity for preventing early activation of interferon in macrophages, thereby 50 allowing for viral replication. In contrast, DUBmut elicited a transient interferon response and 51 ultimately activated over 2,800 genes, including many well-known players in pro-inflammatory 52 pathways and the unfolded protein response. These DUBmut-induced pathways are associated 53 with development and progression of significant disease, similar to what is observed during wild 54 type virus infection. This study demonstrates the distinct consequences of mutating different viral 55 interferon antagonists and reveals that intact coronaviral EndoU activity substantially contributes 56 to the ability of coronaviruses to replicate in macrophages. 57 58 4 63 innate host responses or of later, adaptive responses that aim to limit virus replication. By 64 understanding how these viral antagonists regulate the immune response, we can fine-tune the 65 rational design of therapeutics and vaccines to control existing and emerging viral pathogens. 66 Coronaviruses (CoVs) are members of the order Nidovirales, which includes enveloped viruses 67 with large (~30kb), positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes that yield a characteristic nested 68 set of subgenomic mRNAs during replication in the cytoplasm of infected cells [6,7]. The genome 69 organization for coronaviruses is highly conserved, with the 5'-most two-thirds of the genome 70 encoding the replicase polyprotein, followed by sequences encoding the canonical structural 71 proteins: spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. Many CoVs contain accessory genes, 72 which are interspersed among the genes for the structural proteins. Although these accessory genes 73 are not necessarily required for virus replication and are, in general, not highly conserved within 74 the virus family, many encode proteins that regulate the host response [8]. Interestingly, 75 coronavirus replicase proteins, which are highly conserved, can also act as antagonists to block or 76 delay the innate immune response [9-12]. That a slew of coronavirus-encoded accessory and non-77 accessory proteins have been shown to shape the host antiviral response suggests that viral-78 mediated subversion of host defenses is an important element of infection. Here, we focus on two 79 highly conserved domains within the replicase polyprotein-the viral protease/deubiquitinase 80 (DUB) and the endoribonuclease (EndoU)-with the goal of assessing the relative role(s) of each 81 of these enzymatic activities in shaping the pathogenesis of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a model 82 murine coronavirus. 83 Coronavirus protease activities are critical for processing the replicase polyprotein. Murine 84 coronavirus MHV encodes three proteases: two papain-like proteases (PLP1 and PLP2) and one 85 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro, also termed Mpro). MHV PLP2 is similar to the single",

Therefore, it was necessary for us to identify a residue in the 93 MHV protease/DUB-ubiquitin binding domain that can be mutated to result in reduced DUB 94 activity while maintaining sufficient protease activity to allow for proteolytic processing of the 95 replicase polyprotein. In this report, we describe the X-ray structure-guided generation of such a 96 DUB mutant and our subsequent evaluation of its replication and of the host transcriptional 97 response that it elicits during infection. We also sought to expand our understanding of the role of 98 DUB interferon antagonism by comparing it with another recently identified antagonist, the 99 coronavirus endoribonuclease (EndoU). 100 EndoU, a highly conserved enzyme within the coronavirus family, was initially thought to play 101 a role in coronavirus RNA synthesis [18, 19] . Recent studies revealed that EndoU acts as an 102 interferon antagonist by preventing activation of host sensors of viral double-stranded RNA 103 (dsRNA) [10, 11] . Viruses encoding a catalytically inactive EndoU undergo initial RNA replication 104 but accumulation of viral dsRNA intermediates during replication is detected by host sensors 105 MDA5, PKR, and OAS. Activation of these dsRNA sensors initiates the innate immune response, 106 including activation of type I interferons, interferon-responsive genes, and apoptosis-promoting 107 caspases, all of which collectively limit virus replication. We previously reported that MHV- 118 To investigate the role of viral deubiquitinating activity in coronavirus replication and 119 pathogenesis, we first needed to identify amino acid residues that, when mutated, result in reduced 120 DUB activity while preserving the enzyme's deISGylating and protease activities, the latter being 121 necessary for viral replication. X-ray structural studies of SARS-and MERS-CoV papain-like 122 protease/DUBs co-crystalized with ubiquitin modified at the c-terminus with a covalent warhead 123 (aldehyde, 3-bromo-propylamine, or propargylamine) allowed for identification of residues that 124 are important for direct interaction with ubiquitin [16, 20, 21] . Here, we took a slightly different 125 approach and mutated the catalytic cysteine (C1716) of MHV PLP2 to a serine residue and co-126 crystallized it with free ubiquitin. The X-ray structure of MHV PLP2 (C1716S) in complex with 127 ubiquitin was determined to a resolution of 1.85 \u00c5 and an overall R free = 19.6% and R work = 15.8% 128 (PDB: 5WFI). The overall structure of the MHV PLP2-ubiquitin complex is similar to other 129 PLP2/PLpro ubiquitin-bound structures (Fig 1A) . Ubiquitin binds within the palm region and is 130 gripped by the zinc-fingers motif while the c-terminus extends into the active site.",

A 174 potential explanation for the observed selective disruption of ubiquitin binding stems from our 175 analysis of a primary sequence alignment of ubiquitin and ISG15 and the residues that interact 176 with D1772 ( Fig 2C) . The interaction between MHV PLP2 D1772 and the R42 residue in human 9 177 and mouse ubiquitin is absent in human and mouse ISG15 since this residue is a tryptophan in 178 human and mouse ISG15. Therefore, in line with our observations, D1772A mutation would not 179 be expected to alter ISG15 binding.

We detected elevated levels of interferon 378 and interferon-responsive genes as early as 6-9 hpi, with EndoUmut-infected cells exhibiting by 379 far the highest expression levels of these genes. We and others found that an antiviral response to Raw RNA-seq reads were subjected to analysis using Galaxy's online platform to generate 557 differential gene expression data between infection groups [43] . Reads were clipped to remove 558 any residual unique barcode sequences that were added during preparation of each sample for 559 sequencing. Clipped reads were concatenated to combine multiple files per sample into a single 560 file per sample. These files were groomed to ensure that all reads were in Sanger FASTQ format.",

All reads that did not align to the mouse genome (i.e., reads that 564 originated from viral RNA) were discarded. The BAM files contained the alignment information 565 for each read in that sample and were used as inputs into featureCounts, which quantifies the 26 566 number of reads in each sample that corresponds to each gene in the mouse genome [45] . Finally, 567 the output count data from featureCounts was used as the input for DESeq2 to calculate differential 568 expression for each gene across all samples and treatment groups. DESeq2 was used to generate 569 normalized count values for each gene in all samples [46] . These normalized counts are intended 570 to correct for size differences between samples that might otherwise skew differential expression 571 calculations if some samples contained substantially different numbers of total reads. The 572 normalized count values were plotted and visualized in heat maps, generated using R, and line 573 graphs, generated using Prism software.

This list of genes was filtered based on the 579 statistical significance associated with the fold-change differential expression value. A q-value 580 (aka adjusted p-value, calculated by DESeq2 for each gene in each comparison using the 581 Benjamini-Hochberg procedure) of < 0.05 was chosen as the cutoff for statistical significance; 582 genes whose differential upregulation values did not meet this cutoff in WT-MHV-infected 583 BMDMs at 12 hpi compared with mock-infected cells were removed from the list [46]. Next, a 584 differential expression magnitude cutoff of > 4 was applied to the remaining genes. Genes that 585 were not more highly expressed by at least 4-fold in WT-MHV-infected cells at 12 hpi compared 586 to mock were removed from the list. After applying these cutoffs, 2,879 genes remained and were 587 arranged in order of most-to least-highly upregulated in WT-MHV-infected cells at 12 hpi 588 compared to mock. Cluster 3.0 software was then used to apply mathematical clustering to the z-589 score-standardized log2-normalized mean normalized count values associated with each gene in 27 590 each time point and infection group [47] . Specifically, the default settings-the similarity metric 591 \"Pearson correlation (uncentered)\" and the clustering method \"centroid linkage\"-were applied to ",

Upon 207 evaluating virus replication of the DUBmut virus by performing a growth kinetics experiment in 208 parallel with wild type virus, we found that DUBmut replicates with essentially identical kinetics 209 as the wild type in a murine astrocytoma cell line (DBT cells) (Fig 4A). These results are consistent 210 with previous studies of coronavirus interferon antagonists, which showed in many cell lines that 211 viral-mediated interferon antagonism is not essential for virus replication [10,11]. 212 To determine if the impaired DUB activity of the DUBmut virus had an effect on interferon 213 antagonism, we infected primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and evaluated 214 viral replication kinetics and levels of interferon mRNA and protein.

To test this, we inoculated mice intra-peritoneally 228 with 6\u00d710 4 plaque-forming units (pfu) of the designated virus and measured viral titer in the liver229    and spleen at the indicated days post-infection (dpi). We detected similar levels of infectious 230 particles at 3 dpi, but reduced levels of infectious particles in the livers and spleens of DUBmut-231 infected mice at 5 dpi (Fig 5A). Similar pathology in liver sections was observed at 3 and 5 dpi 232 (Fig 5B). These results suggest that the DUBmut virus is mildly attenuated compared to the wild 233 type virus when evaluated using the intraperitoneal route of infection. We also used the more234 sensitive intracranial infection model to evaluate pathogenesis and found similar lethality among 235 WT and DUBmut-infected mice (Fig 5C). We were surprised at the similarities between wild type 236 and DUBmut infection in vivo since our previous study involving inactivation of a different viral 237 interferon antagonist, EndoU, revealed profound attenuation and rapid clearance of an EndoU-238 mutant virus from infected mice [10]. Having shown that the DUBmut and the EndoUmut viruses 239 each activate an innate immune response, we expected that infection of mice with either mutant 240 virus would lead to similar outcomes. Therefore, as our expectations for the DUBmut virus were 241 in stark contrast to what we observed, we next performed transcriptome profiling of infected 242 macrophages at multiple time points in order to build a more complete understanding of the host 243 response to the wild type virus, DUBmut virus, and the highly attenuated EndoUmut virus. 12 244 Transcriptome profiling reveals differences in kinetics and magnitude of host responses to 245 mutant viruses. 246 BMDMs were infected with the designated virus and total RNA was harvested for RNA-247 seq transcriptome profiling at 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours post-infection (hpi). Using the RNA-seq data, 248 we identified differentially expressed genes by applying a cutoff of at least 4-fold elevated 249 expression in wild type-infected cells at 12 hpi over mock (q < 0.05). We then utilized Cluster 3.0 250 software to visualize overall patterns of gene expression between all groups across all time points 251 (Fig 6). These analyses reveal significant differences in overall patterns of gene expression 252 between the EndoUmut-infected cells and wild type virus-infected cells, whereas the gene 253 expression profile induced by the DUBmut virus is remarkably similar to wild type virus infection 254(Fig 6). More specifically, 2,879 genes are significantly transcriptionally activated (>4-fold, q < 255 0.05) in wild type-and DUBmut-infected macrophages by 12 hpi when compared to mock-256 infected macrophages. Interestingly, our analyses also identified a subset of 231 genes, indicated 257 by the bracket inFigure 6, that were most highly upregulated in EndoUmut-infected cells. It is 258 important to note that these genes were also induced during WT and DUBmut infections, but not 259 to the same magnitude as detected in the EndoUmut-infected cells. We next sought to functionally260 cluster these 231 genes as a means of investigating the respective host transcriptional response to 261 each mutant virus. 262 EndoUmut infection activates genes associated with an antiviral response. 263 Using an online tool called Database for Annotation, Visualization and 264 Integrated Discovery (DAVID) to cluster the 231 genes bracketed in Figure 6 based on functional 265 similarities [24,25], we find that the protein products of these genes are predominantly involved 266 in antiviral and signaling pathways. Notably, the DAVID analyses reveal a subset of 30 unique 267genes, including several interferon isoforms, which are clustered together into statistically 13 268 significant pathways associated with the immune response and signaling cascades(Fig 7A).269    Interestingly, the heat map of these genes reveals a similar temporal trend in upregulation of IFN 270 gene expression during infection with each of the three viruses; however, this expression profile 271 is by far the most pronounced in the EndoUmut-infected cells. In this heatmap view, as inFigure 2726, it is difficult to ascertain any difference in expression of IFN genes between wild type-and273 DUBmut-infected cells; therefore, to obtain more information on the kinetics of transcriptional 274 activation between groups, we quantitated the reads associated with each gene and graphically 275 display the normalized read counts in Figure 7B (also see Supplemental Fig 1). Using this method 276 of plotting the read counts over time, we detected statistically significant transcriptional 277 upregulation of IFN gene expression in the DUBmut-infected cells, in agreement with the data 278 presented in Figure 4. However, the magnitude of DUBmut-induced IFN gene expression was 279 dwarfed by IFN activation in EndoUmut-infected cells. EndoUmut-infected macrophages 280 exhibited markedly elevated levels of IFN transcripts as early as 9 hpi. By 12 hpi, expression of 281 the genes bracketed in Fig 6 upon EndoUmut infection was significantly higher than during WT 282 or DUBmut infection, with our assay detecting 1,000-10,000 more reads per gene in the 283 EndoUmut-infected cells. This focused response to EndoUmut is successful in limiting virus 284 replication in cultured macrophages, as demonstrated in our previous report [10]. Notably, we 285 evaluated the transcriptional response during the first 12 hpi, prior to the onset of apoptosis, which 286 we and others have shown to occur in BMDMs upon EndoUmut infection [10,11].",

The overall patterns of expression of 14 292these genes in DUBmut-and WT-infected BMDMs are strikingly similar(Figs 6 and 7).

Using 295 DAVID-based functional clustering, we identified multiple statistically significant functional 296 clusters within this set of 2,879 genes that are implicated in signaling cascades, the general immune 297 response, and transcriptional regulation.

Instead, these results suggest that the timing and the magnitude 328 of the host antiviral response are critical for determining the outcome of infection in macrophages. 329 Our observation that the EndoUmut virus induces an earlier and more profoundly elevated type I 330 interferon response than even the DUBmut virus implies that there is a threshold of IFN expression 331 that must be breached before the cell mounts an effective antiviral response. 332 The structure-guided approach used to generate the DUBmut virus allowed for 333 characterization of three different classes of mutant enzymes: Class I, deficient in both DUB and 334 de-ISGylating activity; Class II, deficient in de-ISGylating activity only; and Class III, deficient 335 in DUB activity but competent in protease and de-ISGylating activity.

Previous studies demonstrated that 351 ubiquitin has important roles in both the activation and the attenuation of innate antiviral pathways 352 [28]; therefore, we anticipated a more remarkable phenotype for a DUB-mutant virus. We can 353 imagine several possible explanations for our findings. First, it is possible that viral DUB activity 354 has a relatively minor role in shaping pathogenesis in this system. In fact, our recent studies using 355 SARS-CoV and SARS-related CoVs found that the papain-like protease domain/DUB is a 356 virulence trait that varies among members of the SARS-coronavirus species [9]. In that study, we 357 found that replacing the SARS PLP2/DUB domain with a SARS-related PLP2/DUB domain 358 reduced the ability of that virus to antagonize the innate immune response. Together, this previous 359 report in conjunction with the current study support the concept that different PLP2/DUB domains 17 360 may have distinct effects on antagonism of the innate immune response depending on the virus 361 and the host cell type. Another possibility is that the DUB-mutant virus we generated may not have 362 been sufficiently debilitated in its DUB activity to result in altered pathogenesis. We found that it 363 was difficult to recover viable DUB-mutant viruses; indeed, this D1772A mutant was the sole 364 viable DUB-mutant representative of our many attempts. Because an elevated interferon response 365 was elicited from DUBmut-infected cells, this mutant virus fulfilled our criteria demonstrating the 366",

            "text": "EndoUmut infection results in activation of apoptosis, which subsequently limits virus replication381    in cell culture and in infected mice[10,11]. The current study indicates that screening MHV 382 mutants in interferon-responsive cells may be an effective approach to identifying strains that 18 383 stimulate a robust innate immune response, which may then restrict virus replication in animals.384    Previous studies of coronavirus-encoded interferon antagonists focused on evaluating the host385 transcriptional response to infection at later time points (such as 24 and 48 hpi) and in a variety of 386 cell types or the tissues of infected animals. For example, a study comparing infection of mice 387 with wild type SARS-CoV versus a virus containing a mutation in the interferon antagonist nsp16, 388 termed the dNSP16 CoV, revealed that the transcriptional profile in the lungs of the dNSP16-389 infected mice mirrored the response to wild type virus [12]. However, combining the dNSP16 390 mutation with a mutation in another interferon antagonist, ExoN, was shown to reduce disease in 391 mice and elicit protective immunity. It would be interesting to determine if the transcriptional 392 profile elicited by the double mutant SARS-CoV is altered compared to wild type virus, 393 particularly at early times after infection. A study of MERS-CoV comparing the host response to 394 wild type virus with the response to a mutant virus containing deleted accessory open reading 395 frames (MERS-CoV dORF3-5) provides evidence of significant differences in the early 396 transcriptional responses to infection in Calu3 2B4 cells [29]. This study revealed that MERS-CoV 397 dORF3-5 infection prompted earlier (7, 12, and 24 hpi) and more robust type I and type III 398 interferon responses, and that the mutant virus was more sensitive than wild type to pre-treatment 399 with interferon. The MERS-CoV interferon antagonist mutant virus was attenuated in mice and 400 elicited a protective response against subsequent lethal challenge. For coronaviruses, one difficulty 401 that arises when evaluating the role(s) of viral-mediated modulation of the host response is that 402 multiple viral proteins, including both structural and nonstructural proteins, have been shown to 403 antagonize the innate immune response in vitro and/or in vivo. These include: nsp16-2'O MTase, 404 nsp14-ExoN, nsp1, nsp7, E protein, N protein, M protein, SARS-CoV-ORF6, MERS-CoV-ORF3-405 5, MERS-CoV-4a, and MERS-CoV-4b [12,29-33]. Each of these interferon antagonists may play 19 406 either a cell-or tissue-type specific role, or act in concert with other factors during viral replication 407 to mitigate the innate immune response. Further studies are needed to fully understand if all or 408 only a subset of these antagonists must be silenced to generate an effective, live-attenuated vaccine. 409 The results presented here and from the study of the MERS-CoV dORF3-5 mutant virus indicate 410 that inactivating interferon antagonists and screening for an early and robust antiviral 411 transcriptional profile may represent an efficient and informative approach to evaluating live-412 attenuated vaccine candidate strains for existing and emerging coronaviruses.413 Our results demonstrating upregulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in response 414 to wild type and DUBmut coronavirus replication confirm and extend the work of earlier studies 415 that documented activation of the ER sensors PERK, IRE1, and ATF-6 during coronavirus 416 infection [32,34,35]. Heavy utilization of the endoplasmic reticulum for generating coronavirus 417 replication complexes and of the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment for assembling virus 418 particles places a substantial load on the host translational machinery during infection. Host 419 sensors IRE1, ATF-6, and PERK are situated in the ER to sense and respond to such overload by 420 prompting upregulated expression of genes encoding ER chaperones, amino acid transporters, and 421 activators of lipid biosynthesis. Ironically, many of these proteins ultimately facilitate virus 422 replication and assembly. Notably, it has been demonstrated that UPR pathways that promote 423 apoptosis are blocked during coronavirus replication [32,34]. The ability of viruses to modulate 424 the UPR has important implications for the innate immune response to such viruses because the 425 UPR has been shown to attenuate antiviral defenses by way of degrading the type I interferon 426 receptor [36]. To our knowledge, the results presented here provide the first transcriptomic 427 evidence of UPR activation in coronavirus-infected macrophages, underlining an important role 428 for UPR pathways in the coronavirus life cycle. Our observation that EndoUmut-infected 20 429 macrophages exhibit significantly lower expression of several genes involved in UPR pathways 430 compared with wild type-and DUBmut-infected cells is consistent with the reduced levels of virus 431 replication detected in EndoUmut-infected macrophages. 432 The notion of inactivating viral interferon antagonists as a means of generating live-433 attenuated vaccines is supported by recent reports of screening for inactivation of influenza A 434 virus-encoded interferon antagonists [3], as well as studies that revealed that the classic vaccine 435 strain of yellow fever virus encodes an interferon antagonist in the NS5 protein [37]. For 436 coronaviruses, it is not yet clear if disabling a single interferon antagonist, such as the highly 437 conserved EndoU, will be sufficient to attenuate viruses that infect different cell types in different 438 species. Promisingly, our studies of a coronavirus that causes lethal disease in piglets, porcine 439 epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), revealed that inactivation of EndoU activity is associated with 440 attenuated disease [38]. However, additional work is needed to evaluate potential reversion of 441 EndoU mutant viruses and to determine if inactivating multiple interferon antagonists is an 442 effective approach for generating safe and effective live-attenuated coronavirus vaccines. mouse experiment in this study was carried out in accordance with the 446 recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National 447 Institutes of Health. The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional 448 Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Loyola University Chicago (IACUC#: 2016-029). 449 C57BL/6 female mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained in the 450 Comparative Medicine Facility of Loyola University Chicago. Mice were consistently monitored 21 451 for signs of distress over the course of the experiments to be removed from the experiment and 452 euthanized using carbon dioxide inhalation to prevent unnecessary suffering. 453 Cells 454 Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were purchased the from American Type 455 Culture Collection (ATCC, # CRL-11268) and maintained in DMEM (#10-017-CV, Corning) 456 containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and supplemented with 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% 457 HEPES, 2% L-glutamine, 1% sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. DBT cells were 458 cultured in MEM (#61100-061, ThermoFisher) supplemented with 5% FCS, 2% L-glutamine, and 459 10% Tryptose Phosphate Broth (TPB). The 17Cl-1 cell line was maintained in DMEM containing 460 5% FCS. Baby hamster kidney cells expressing the MHV receptor (BHK-R) were kindly provided 461 by Mark Denison (Vanderbilt University Medical Center) and maintained in DMEM supplemented 462 with 10% FCS, 2% L-glutamine, and 0.8 \u00b5g/mL G418. Bone marrow-derived macrophages 463 (BMDMs) were prepared and cultured as described previously [10]. 464 Plasmids and mutagenesis 465 The sequence of the PLP2 domain (amino acids 1525-1911 of MHV pp1ab) in frame with 466 a V5 epitope tag was codon-optimized, synthesized by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ) (sequence 467 available upon request), and cloned into pCAGGS vector. For mutagenesis, an overlapping PCR 468 strategy was used with synthetic primers (sequences available upon request). The introduced 469 mutations were verified by sequencing. The RIG-I and nsp2/3-GFP expression plasmid was kindly 470 provided Ralph Baric (University of North Carolina). The IFN\u03b2-Luc reporter plasmid was a gift 471 of John Hiscott (Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada). The Flag-Ub plasmid was kindly 472 provided by Adriano Marchese (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee). 22 473 MHV PLP2 wild type and mutant purification, kinetics, and X-ray structure 474 The wild type, C1716S, D1772A, R1803A, and F1812A mutant enzymes were expressed 475 and purified similar to our previously published methods except that the MHV PLP2 construct 476 used here (amino acids N1609 to N1909) was absent the DPUP domain [39]. Crystallization and 477 X-ray structure determination details will be published elsewhere. Steady-state kinetic studies on 478 the wild type, D1772A, R1803A, and F1812A mutant enzymes with substrates Z-RLRGG-AMC 479 (where Z is a carboxybenzyl protecting group), Ubiquitin-AMC, and ISG15-AMC were performed 480 as described previously [39]. X-ray structural coordinates have been deposited under PDB code 481 5WFI. Structure figures were generated with the software program UCSF Chimera [40]. 482 Protease and deubiquitinating activity assays 483 To determine the protease activity of PLP2, HEK293T cells grown to 70% confluency in 484 24-well plates (Corning) were transfected using TransIT-LT1 (MIR2300, Mirus) according to the 485 manufacturer's protocol. For the protease activity assay, HEK293T cells were transfected with 25 486 ng nsp2/3-GFP plasmid and 200 ng pCAGGS-PLP2-V5 expression plasmids (wild type and 487 mutant). To determine deubiquitinating activity of the proteins, cells were transfected with 200 ng 488 Flag-Ub plasmid and pCAGGS-PLP2-V5 expression plasmids (wild type and mutant). Cells were 489 lysed 24 h post-transfection with 100 \u00b5L of lysis buffer (comprising 20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 490 mM NaCl, 1mM EGTA, 1mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1mM \u03b2-491 glycerophosphate, 1mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 \u00b5g/mL leupeptin, and 1mM 492 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred 493 to PVDF membrane in transfer buffer (0.025M Tris, 0.192M glycine, 20% methanol) for 1 hour 494 at 60 Volts at 4\u00b0C. Following this, the membrane was blocked using 5% dried skim milk in TBST 495 buffer (0.9% NaCl, 10mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 0.1% Tween 20) overnight at 4\u00b0C. The membrane 496 was incubated with either polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibody (A11122, Life Technologies) for 23 497 the protease assay, or mouse anti-flag (F3165, Sigma) for the DUB assay. The membrane was then 498 washed three times for 15 minutes in TBST buffer followed by incubation with either secondary 499 donkey anti-rabbit-HRP antibody (711-035-152, Jackson ImmunoResearch) or goat anti-mouse-500 HRP antibody (1010-05, SouthernBiotech). Then the membrane was washed three more times for 501 15 minutes in TBST buffer. Detection was performed using Western Lighting Chemiluminescence 502 Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer) and visualized using a FluoroChemE Imager (Protein Simple). The 503 expression of PLP2, \u03b2-actin, and calnexin were probed with mouse anti-V5 antibody (R960, 504 ThermoFisher), mouse anti-\u03b2-actin (A00702, Genscript), or mouse anti-calnexin antibody (2433S, 505 Cell Signaling), respectively.506Biosensor live cell assay507    The protease activity of PLP2 was also assessed using a biosensor live cell assay as508 described previously [41]. Briefly, HEK293T cells in a 96 black-wall plate were transfected with 509 37.5 ng pGlo-RLKGG construct and 50 ng PLP2 expression plasmids. GloSensor (E1290, 510 Promega) reagent diluted in DMEM+10% FCS was added at 18 hpi. Plates were read using a 511 luminometer (Veritas) every hour over a course of 5 hours. 512 Generating DUB-mutant MHV 513 We used a previously described reverse genetics system of MHV-A59 [23] to generate the 514 DUB-mutant virus. Briefly, the nucleotides coding for the Asp-1772 of the PLP2 domain were 515 mutated via site-directed mutagenesis. Viral genomic RNA from in vitro transcription of ligated 516 cDNA fragments using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Transcription Kit (AM1344, Thermal 517 Fisher) was electroporated into BHK-R cells. Cell supernatants were collected as viral stock 518 following observation of cytopathic effects. Rescued virus was plaque-purified, propagated on 519 BHK-R cells, and titrated on 17Cl-1 cells. The stock virus was subjected to full-genome 24 520sequencing and the sequences were aligned to the parental strain, with the or BMDMs were infected with wild type icMHV-A59 or DUB-mutant virus at 525 a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in serum-free medium. After a one-hour incubation, the 526 inoculum was replaced with fresh, complete medium. Cell culture supernatants were collected at 527 indicated time points and titrated by plaque assay on 17Cl-1 cells. Titers were obtained from three 528 independent assays for each sample. Graphs of virus kinetics were generated using Prism software 529 (GraphPad Software).",
