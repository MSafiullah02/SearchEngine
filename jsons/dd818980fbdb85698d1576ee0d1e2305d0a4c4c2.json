The overall percentage of resistant strains to streptomycin, sulphadimethoxine and tetracycline was very high (above 70%). A high level of resistance (from 30% to 50%) to ampicillin, kanamycin, neomycin and chloramphenicol was also detected. The E. coli strains were highly susceptible to cephalosporins, polymyxin and quinolones. Most of the strains showed multiresistance: 77.2% of isolates were resistant to at least two antibiotics, 55.4% were resistant to at least four antibiotics and 33.7% were resistant to at least six antibiotics. A total of 34 antibiotypes could be distinguished.",

Certain E. coli strains are an important cause of diarrhoea in all farm animal species (Holland, 1 9 9 0 Wray et al.. 1993) . The role of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), which produces enterotoxins and expresses fibrial colonization factors in neonatal diarrhoea, has been well established. In addition, other non-enterotoxigenic E. coli strains that produce other toxins [verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC) and necrotoxigenic E. coli (NTEC)] or cause a characteristic histological lesion [attaching and effacing E. coli (AEEC)] have also been associated with neonatal diarrhoea in domestic animals (Holland. 1990; De Rycke. 1991) . Although the etiological diagnosis in small ruminants is not determined for a large percentage of cases of neonatal diarrhoea, application of anti-microbial therapy is a common feature in clinical practice. However, high proportions of resistant E. coli strains in farm animals and even in animal feed lots have been reported (Coates & Hoopes, 1980 : Jackson, 1981 Wood et al.. 1983; Prescott et al.. 1984; Gonzalez & Blanco, 1985 . 1986 Aalbzk et al.. 1991; Adesiyun, 1992; Wray et al., 1993 : Blanco et aL.1993 . The aim of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of E. coli strains isolated from diarrhoeic lambs and kids to different antimicrobial agents.",

One strain per animal was selected. None of the strains studied produced F5 or F41 fimbrial antigens or heat-stable enterotoxin STa (Cid et al.. 1993) . Fifty-four of the strains were selected because they produce one of the following potential virulence factors: 21 strains produced F17 fimbrial antigen, 16 were VTEC, 12 were NTEC and five produced heat-labile enterotoxin.

Mueller-Hinton agar (Difco) was used for the agar dilution procedure. The standarized inocula were prepared by inoculating each strain into 2 mL of brain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Difco). The tubes were incubated at 37\u00b0C until the turbidity reached a density corresponding to McFarland nephelometer standard no. 0.5. Bacterial cultures were diluted 1 : l O in 0.9% NaCl solution and 1 pL of each bacterial suspension was applied by use of a Steers replicator to the anti-microbial-containing agar plates, yielding an inoculum of approximately lo4 CW per spot. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was read as the lowest concentration of anti-microbial agent that suppressed visible bacterial growth. One colony or a slight haze in which no distinct colonies could be observed was ignored. Reference strain E. coli ATCC 25922 was included as an internal control in all parts of the study. The range of interpretative categories of susceptibility for each anti-microbial agent were those recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, 1990 ).",

The use of drugs does not induce resistance but rather provides an intense selection pressure which eliminates the susceptible bacteria in the host and spares the resistant ones (Hinton et al.. 1986 ). This is particularly true for bacteria that inhabit the intestinal tract because they are readily exposed to the actions of antibiotics administered orally either at prophylactic or therapeutic levels or when incorporated in animal feed as growth promoters (Hinton et al.. 1986 ). Studies of E. coli isolated from different animal species showed a relationship between the degree of anti-microbial drug use and extent of resistance (Linton, 1977) . Therefore, antibiotic resistance is usually prevalent in intensively reared calves, pigs and poultry, whereas adult grazing cattle and sheep have a very low incidence of resistance among their faecal E. coli (Linton, 1977 : Hinton et al., 1985 .",

Multiple drug-resistant isolates of E. coli strains from farm animals have been reported worldwide (Coates & Hoopes. 1980 : jakson. 1981 Prescott et al., 1984;  Gonzalez & Blanco. 1985 . 1986 : Aalbzk et d., 1991 : Adesiyun. 1992 : Wray et al., 1993 Blanco et d., 1993) . The seriousness of the problem arises from the fact that once multiresistant organisms develop they can persist in the host or in the environment in the absence of antibiotic selection (Hinton, 1986) . This may be of particular importance since cattle (Orskov et al., 1987; Borzyck et al., 1987 : Gonzalez & Blanco, 1989 ) and probably sheep and goats (Doyle & Schoeni. 1987; Beutin et al., 1993) might act as reservoirs of certain E. coli strains pathogenic for man. Nevertheless, as suggested by Hinton (1986) , the importance of animals as a source of resistant E. coli should not be taken out of context because the medical use of antibiotics is principally responsible for the presence of resistance among bacterial isolates from man.",
