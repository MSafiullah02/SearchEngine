The common clinical features include fever (not in all cases), cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, headache, myalgia and breathlessness. Conjunctivitis has also been described. Such symptoms are altogether indistinguishable from those observed in other respiratory infections. In a subset of patients, by the end of the first week the disease can progress to pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. However, the incidence of less common features like diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort varies significantly among different study populations, along with an early and mild onset frequently followed by typical respiratory symptoms [4]. More recently, a growing clinical evidence reminds us that the digestive system in addition to the respiratory system may serve as an alternative route of infection, possibly when people come into contact with asymptomatic carriers or persons with mild intestinal symptoms at an early stage 5, 6, 7. The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and/or diarrhoea, is uncertain; some authors report a frequency below 5%, while others estimate it to be as high as 50% [8]. The psychological impact on the general public has been already assessed in China, where a survey was conducted on 1210 people to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak [9]. The survey has shown that 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels.",

Moreover, in Italy, more than 95% of all endoscopic procedures are performed inside hospital facilities which are at present substantially overwhelmed with COVID patients and burdened by COVID-related layout re-organization issues [10]. Patients must hold a prescription by their GPs or, in case of urgent/emergent need, may directly access to the emergency room. Medical procedures within the NHS are classified in 4 categories: class \u201cU\u201d, ideally due in 3 working days; class \u201cB\u201d and \u201cD\u201d, due in 10 and 60 days, respectively; and class \u201cP\u201d, not urgent, to be performed within 6 months. This method is intended to provide an efficient and clinically driven access to diagnostic facilities, with a very fast track access for class U prescriptions and a fast track access for class B ones, whereas class D and P normally enter a longer waiting list, based on local availability and regional policies. After receiving a class U (i.e., a very fast track) or a class B (a fast track), each patient can book the required procedure either by telephone via a regional call center or directly by any local hospital, where a definite number of positions are reserved for these two classes. During normal periods, the demand of class B procedures largely outnumbers availability, with minimal or no \u201cnon presenter\u201d patients.",

These data were collected by one gastroenterologist at each Centre, starting on March 30th, including the last three consecutive weeks of March, i.e. , from March 9 until March 27. We choose this time frame since in Lombardia and Piemonte endoscopic examinations were carried out under no particular restriction until March 8, when all the hospitals were formally invited to cancel elective procedures except for class U and B indications in order to prepare for the massive flux of COVID 19 patients. On the other hand, in the same period, national restrictive measures were adopted, which greatly limited movement of persons unless deemed absolutely necessary, for example to attend medical visits or examinations (so called quarantine). Finally, already since the first period of quarantine, social media, newspapers and television supported the perception that hospitals could have been very at high risk of transmitting COVID infection.",

Thus, patients pondered the fear of having a clinically relevant disease with the fear of being infected by coronavirus, and a relevant percentage of them (29.4%) decided not to show up by the endoscopy units on the scheduled date. At present, the consequences of this choice are not clear. Speculating that the rate of organic and of cancer diseases should remain stable over three weeks, the reduced number of performed procedures will greatly influence the fate of non-presenters in the near future. This can be considered an indirect effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on our health system and must be attributed to the adverse psychological consequences of COVID-19 infection on the general patient population and particularly on GI patients. We think that the trend observed is not the results of confounding, since the majority of the procedures have been booked before the lock down date and thus no effect of the epidemic on changing prescription habit by GPs is to hypothesized. Also, no effect of geographical location would bias our observations, since the data from the two regions are comparable as far as percentages of presenters/vs non presenters are concerned. Moreover, the prescription policy in the two northern Regions is the same, including the availability of a fast track (class B) or of an urgent track (Class U). Finally, regional healthcare authorities of both Lombardia and Piemonte have clearly stated that class B and U prescriptions had to be safeguarded and accomplished throughout the epidemic phase. Thus barriers for patients with a class U or B prescription were only of psychological and not of regulatory nature. On the other hand, it is true that the pressure on health care system has been overwhelming on hospital admissions. The present survey however did not focus on inpatients.",

The recently published international guidelines allow us to implement all measures that both patients and physicians should follow to avoid/minimise risk of COVID-19 infections in the hospital and in particular in the GI suite [11, 12]. We should right now offer different pathway for patients with high and low risk of COVID-19 infection. We should certainly not encourage discontinuation of screening procedures or fast-track (class B) procedures because the consequences of these choices outweigh the benefits of preventing COVID-19 infections in our patient population.",
