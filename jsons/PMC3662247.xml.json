It likely evolved as a cell stress response to starvation and subsequently to limit damage and maintain cellular homeostasis as a means to exert protein/organelle quality control 10. Autophagic dysfunction is linked to several human diseases. For example, it can exert tumor suppressing 11, 12 as well as tumor promoting functions 13, 14, in a context and cell type\u2010specific manner. Several studies reveal a crucial role for autophagy in adaptive and innate immunity 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, with the term \u2018immunophagy\u2019 22 referring to all such processes collectively (Fig. \n\n1\n). Autophagy degrades microbes (such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoa) that invade and gain access to the cytosol 16, 24, 25. This process is termed \u2018xenophagy\u2019 26. The precise membrane dynamics and mediators of xenophagy, however, are not fully understood. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the process and function of autophagy and focus on the complex relationship between immunophagy and the initiating signal 0s with specific emphasis on PAMPs and DAMPs.",

Among these, macroautophagy has been the most extensively studied 8. However, the precise mechanisms mediating microautophagy in mammalian cells are still unclear 32. Macroautophagy most commonly (hereafter referred to as \u2018autophagy\u2019) is initiated by the formation of the phagophore, followed by a series of steps, including the elongation and expansion of the phagophore and the closure and completion of a double\u2010membrane autophagosome, which sequesters cytosolic material. Autophagosome maturation includes several vesicular fusion events that originates from early and late endosomes (amphisomes) and lysosomes (autolysosomes), followed by breakdown and degradation of the autophagosome and amphisomes through acid hydrolases inside the autolysosome. Recycling of the resulting macromolecules is mediated through permeases. Several recent studies suggest that autophagosomes may also fuse with cell membranes, promoting exocytosis, secretion, or extrusion of autophagic contents 33, 34, 35.",

Shortly thereafter, when we (MTL) asked him about the role of signal 0s in the setting of sterile inflammation, including cancer, he indicated that their role was indeed a concern but was at that time unclear. PAMPs are essential functional components of microorganisms that direct the targeted host cell to distinguish \u2018self\u2019 from \u2018non\u2010self\u2019 (\u2018stranger hypothesis\u2019) and promote signals associated with innate immunity 48. Major PAMPs are microbial nucleic acids, including DNA (e.g. unmethylated CpG motifs), double\u2010stranded RNA (dsRNA), single\u2010stranded RNA (ssRNA), and 5\u2032\u2010triphosphate RNA, as well as lipoproteins, surface glycoproteins, and membrane components [peptidoglycans, lipoteichoic acid, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and glycosylphosphatidylinositol]. They are recognized by Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs) and other PRRs, such as retinoid acid\u2010inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I)\u2010like receptors (RLRs), AIM2 like receptors (ALRs), and nucleotide\u2010binding oligomerization domain (NOD)\u2010like receptors (NLRs) 48, 49, 50.

Examples of non\u2010protein DAMPs include ATP, uric acid, heparin sulfate, RNA, and DNA. DAMPs can also be mimicked by release of intracellular mitochondria, consisting of formyl peptides and mitochondrial DNA (with CpG DNA repeats), to activate human polymorphonuclear neutrophils through activation of TLR9 66, which reveals an important link between trauma and inflammation.

Release of HMGB1 extracellularly is a common denominator in the response to both cell or tissue injury including organ harvest and associated ischemia/reperfusion insults, and microbial invasion 67, 68, 69. The redox/thiol\u2010reducing protein HMGB1 mediates the response to infection, inflammation, migration, proliferation, and differentiation 70, 71, 72. It is specifically recognized by several cell surface receptors including RAGE, TLR4, TLR2, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells\u20101 (TREM\u20101), and CD24 (Fig. \n\n5\n). CD24 serves as a negative signaling molecule to limit DAMP\u2010 but not PAMP\u2010mediated inflammation 73. The HMGB1 protein induces migration and activation of human dendritic cells (DCs), eosinophil, natural killer (NK)\u2010DC cross\u2010talk, and T\u2010cell activation 70, 71. HMGB1 causes TLR4\u2010dependent activation of NADPH oxidase as well as increased ROS production 74. Interestingly, a cysteine at position 106 (Cys106) within HMGB1 is required for binding to TLR4 and activation of cytokine release in macrophages 75. The oxidation of HMGB1 Cys106 alone is sufficient to block the immunogenic activity of HMGB1 for DCs 76. These findings suggest that redox regulates HMGB1 function in the setting of emergent immunity and inflammation (Fig. \n\n5\n).

Autophagy, not apoptosis, is a major regulator of HMGB1 localization and release by ROS in the early events following cell stress 158, 159. Notably, both endogenous and exogenous HMGB1 are important regulators of autophagy 158, 159, 160, 161. Endogenous HMGB1 competes with Bcl\u20102 for interaction with Beclin 1 and orients Beclin 1 toward autophagosomes 159. Interaction between HMGB1 and Beclin1 relies upon the autophagic complex ULK1\u2010mAtg13\u2010FIP200 162. In addition, HMGB1 may be involved in the regulation of Bcl\u20102 phosphorylation by the extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase (ERK)/MAPK pathway 159. The intramolecular disulfide bridge (C23/45) of HMGB1 is required for binding to Beclin 1 and sustaining autophagy (Fig. \n\n6\n). Reducible HMGB1 binds to RAGE, induces Beclin 1\u2010dependent autophagy (Fig. \n\n5\n), and promotes resistance to chemotherapeutic agents or ionizing radiation 158. In contrast, oxidized HMGB1 increases the cytotoxicity of these agents and induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway 158. There is a direct molecular interaction between HMGB1 and p53 in colorectal cancer to regulate apoptosis and autophagy 163. Loss of p53 increases cytosolic HMGB1 leading to increased binding to Beclin 1, thereby promoting autophagy, and decreasing apoptosis. In contrast, loss of HMGB1 increases cytosolic p53 and apoptosis and decreases autophagy. HDACs regulate HMGB1 nuclear versus cytosolic localization within monocytic cells 164. HMGB1 within the nucleus enhances DNA repair and chromatin modification following DNA damage 165. It is unknown whether HMGB1 mediates the HDAC\u2010autophagy pathway in DNA\u2010damage repair 166, but this represents a distinct possibility. In addition, HMGB1 and the downstream mediator heat shock protein \u03b2\u20101 (HSPB1/HSP27) modulates mitochondrial respiration and morphology by sustaining autophagy/mitophagy 167, as we have shown, suggesting that HMGB1 is essential for mitochondrial quality control.

The breakdown products derived from autophagy have a dual role, providing substrates for both biosynthesis and energy generation 209. ATP is produced by cellular respiration (either glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation/OXPHOS) in mitochondria. Mitophagy is important in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis 41. Suppression of HMGB1 expression in fibroblasts and cancer cells significantly inhibits both OXPHOS and glycolysis, and ATP production is decreased in HMGB1\u2010deficient cells 167. We demonstrated that HMGB1 modulates the expression of HSPB1. As a cytoskeleton regulator, HSPB1 is critical for dynamic intracellular trafficking during autophagy and mitophagy. Phosphorylation of HSPB1 (both Ser15 and Ser86) is required for HMGB1\u2010dependent mitochondrial homeostasis. Loss of either HMGB1 or HSPB1 results in a phenotypically similar deficiency in mitophagy typified by mitochondrial fragmentation with decreased aerobic respiration and ATP production. In addition, the Pink1\u2010Parkin pathway is required for HMGB1/HSPB1 mediated mitophagy. Recent findings indicate that mitochondrial STAT3 sustains the altered glycolytic and OXPHOS activities characteristic of cancer cells 210. We found that RAGE\u2010mediated autophagy is required for IL\u20106\u2010induced mitochondrial localization and function of STAT3 205. Knockdown of RAGE by shRNA in murine and human pancreatic tumor cell lines significantly decreases IL\u20106/STAT3\u2010mediated mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I activity and ATP production.

Interactions between immune and dying tumor cells likely determine the balance between immunity and tolerance to tumor cells.

The organization of the cellular networks linking autophagy to other biologic processes are quite complicated 37. For example, mTOR\u2010 213, Beclin 1\u2010 214, and Atg5/Atg7\u2010independent 215 alternative autophagy\u2010activating pathways have been discovered.

Moreover, the relationship between autophagy and other membrane trafficking systems including phagocytosis, endocytosis, and exocytosis and their relation to host defense remains largely unknown and needs more intensive study. Whether autophagy is required for generation of immunological memory following inflammation initiated by signal 0s and the subsequent recruitment and maturation of inflammatory/immune cells is unknown. Whether autophagy serves as a necessary feedback loop to allow emergence of innate and adaptive immune function and the recall response are similarly unclear. This knowledge is important in an era developing and applying autophagy\u2010inhibiting drugs.

Microautophagy refers to the sequestration of cytosolic components directly by lysosomes through invaginations within their limiting membrane. Chaperone\u2010mediated autophagy involves direct translocation of unfolded substrate proteins (KFERQ\u2010like motif) across the lysosome membrane through the action of a cytosolic and lysosomal chaperone heat shock cognate protein of 70 kDa (Hsc70), and the integral membrane receptor lysosome\u2010associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP\u20102A). In the case of macroautophagy, the cargo is sequestered within a unique double membrane cytosolic vesicle, an autophagosome. The autophagosome itself is formed by expansion of the phagophore. The autophagosome undergoes fusion with a late endosome or lysosome to form an autolysosome, in which the sequestered material is degraded. Degradation of membrane lipids and proteins by the autolysosome generates free fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acids that can be reused by the cell to maintain mitochondrial ATP energy production, protein synthesis, and thereby promote cell survival. The molecular machinery of macroautophagy was largely discovered in yeast and the centrally important proteins referred to as autophagy\u2010related (ATG) proteins although some similar proteins in mammals have disparate names (Beclin\u20101 = ATG6, LC3 = ATG8 for example).",

            "text": "Figure 3: \nOverview of the major signal transduction pathways that regulate autophagy and apoptosis. Common molecular regulators include gene products that affect both autophagy and apoptosis and the pathways that they influence. The process of apoptotic cell death is mediated by two central pathways: an extrinsic pathway involving cell surface receptors (the death receptor pathway), and an intrinsic pathway using mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (the mitochondrial pathway). A third pathway is mediated by cytolytic T and NK cells delivering perforin/granzymes to promote apoptosis. CD95 (also called Fas or APO\u20101) induces apoptosis by forming a death\u2010inducing signaling complex (DISC) at the receptor that contains FADD, caspase\u20108, and the caspase\u20108 regulator. Autophagy can degrade active caspase\u20108. The FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIP), a caspase\u2010like molecule without proteolytic activity, protects cells from CD95\u2010induced apoptosis. FLIP can suppress autophagy. The intrinsic mitochondrial pathway is activated by diverse apoptotic signals such as DNA damage, growth factor deprivation, and oxidative stress. Cytoplasmic translocation of mitochondrial proteins [such as cytochrome c (cyt c) and Smac/DIABLO] lead to activation of the caspase cascade and initiate apoptosis. A pivotal event in the mitochondrial pathway is mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which is mainly regulated by Bcl\u20102 family members. Some of the Bcl\u20102 family members (e.g. Bcl\u20102, and Bcl\u2010XL) are anti\u2010apoptotic, whereas others (e.g. Bax, tBid, Bad, Bim, PUMA, and Noxa) are pro\u2010apoptotic. Mitophagy is a well established mechanism necessary for elimination of dysfunctional mitochondria and regulation of mitochondrial quality in yeast or mammalian cells associated with cytosolic mediators such as NIX, Atg32, optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), dynamin\u2010related protein 1 (DRP1), unc\u201051\u2010like kinase 1 (ULK1), Parkin, Pink1, voltage\u2010dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), p62/Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), mitofusin 1, and mitofusin 2. Beclin 1, the mammalian ortholog of yeast Atg6, plays a central role in autophagy. It interacts with several cofactors (e.g. Atg14L, UVRAG, Bif\u20101, Rubicon, Ambra1, HMGB1, nPIST, VMP1, SLAM, IP\n3R, PINK, and Survivin) to regulate the formation of Beclin 1\u2010PI3KC3 complexes, thereby inducing autophagy. In contrast, the BH3 domain of Beclin 1 is bound to and inhibited by Bcl\u20102 or Bcl\u2010XL. This interaction can be disrupted by phosphorylation of Bcl\u20102 and Beclin 1, or ubiquitination of Beclin 1. Interestingly, caspase\u2010mediated cleavage of Beclin 1 promotes cross\u2010talk between apoptosis and autophagy. Although apoptosis\u2010associated cleavage of Beclin 1 and Atg5 inactivates autophagy, the cleavage of Atg4D by caspase\u20103 generates a fragment with increased autophagic activity. In the presence of growth factors, growth factor receptor signaling activates PI3KC1 at the plasma membrane. PI3KC1 activates the downstream target AKT, leading to activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by inhibiting the tuberous sclerosis complex 1/2 (TSC1\u2013TSC2), which results in inhibition of autophagy. Overexpression of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene, by an inducible promoter, antagonizes PI3KC1 to induce autophagy. RAS has a dual effect on autophagy. When it activates PI3KC1, autophagy is inhibited, but when it selectively activates the RAF1\u2013mitogen\u2010activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)\u2013extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase (ERK) cascade, autophagy is stimulated. AMPK monitors the energy status of the cell by sensing the AMP:ATP ratio. Several upstream kinases, including liver kinase B1 (LKB1, which is activated by energy depletion), calcium/calmodulin kinase kinase\u2010\u03b2 (CaMKK\u03b2, which is activated by cytosolic Ca2+ levels), and TGF\u03b2 activated kinase\u20101 (TAK\u20101, which is also involved in IKK activation), can activate AMPK by phosphorylation. Activated AMPK promotes inhibition of mTOR kinase, which induces autophagy. NF\u2010\u03baB and p53 play a double role in regulating autophagy in a transcription dependent and/or independent fashion. In contrast, E2F1 and FOXO3 positively regulate autophagy in a transcription dependent fashion. Nuclear HMGB1 inhibits the p53\u2010dependent transactivation from the Bax promoter. Accumulation of cytosolic HMGB1 sustains autophagy by liberating the Beclin 1 and PI3KC3 complexes. RAGE\u2010induced autophagy is associated with decreased phosphorylation of mTOR and increased Beclin1\u2010PI3KC3 interactions.",

TLR1\u2010TLR2 and TLR2\u2010TLR6 recognize bacterial triacylated lipopeptide or diacyl lipopeptide, respectively, and recruit TIR adapter protein (TIRAP) and MyD88 at the plasma membrane to activate the MyD88\u2010dependent pathway. TLR5 recognizes flagellin and activates the MyD88\u2010dependent pathway. TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 reside in the endosome and recognize dsRNA, ssRNA, CpG DNA, or mitochondrial DNA (Mit DNA), respectively. They recruit TRIF or MyD88 to activate the IRF3 or IRF7 pathway. All immunogenic nucleic acids bind indicated cytosolic DNA sensors or RNA sensors, including retinoid acid\u2010inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I)\u2010like receptors (RLRs), which are required for subsequent recognition by specific pattern recognition receptors to activate innate immune responses. DAMPs such as HMGB1, S100 proteins (S100s), and heat shock proteins (HSPs) recognize the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), TLR4, or triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells\u20101 (TREM\u20101) and activate the MyD88\u2010MAPK\u2010NF\u2010\u03baB pathway.

LPS bound to LPS\u2010binding protein (LBP) is presented to CD14. CD14 maneuvers the LPS\u2010LBP complex to TLR4, and LPS, in combination with accessory molecule MD2, activates TLR4 signaling. LPS induces activation of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)\u2010associated factor 6 (TRAF6)\u2010p38 MAPK pathway and induces the expression of TNF\u2010\u03b1 and Beclin 1 by NF\u2010\u03baB. NF\u2010\u03baB inhibits TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010induced autophagy. Multiple means to promote ROS production converge on the mitochondria or alternatively, NADPH oxidases such as NOX2 and NOX4.
