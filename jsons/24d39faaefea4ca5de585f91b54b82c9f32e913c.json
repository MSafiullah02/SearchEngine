Gastrointestinal illness is the most common travel-related problem, and travelers should be equipped with antidiarrheal medications and possibly antibiotics to reduce the severity of symptoms (Angelo, Kozarsky, Ryan, Chen, & Sotir, 2017; Baer et al., 2014; Leder et al., 2013) .

Hagmann et al. (2017) found that 0.8% of all international female travelers of childbearing age who were seeking pretravel care were pregnant. Although there are no restrictions that preclude pregnant women from traveling abroad, even to areas with substandard sanitation, some areas may have limited access to health care services. Most commercial airlines have specific regulations addressing air travel during pregnancy, often restricting women from flying after 36 weeks gestation because of the possibility of preterm birth or other late-term pregnancy complications. Limited evidence suggests that cosmic radiation, vibration, or noise may pose some risk to pregnant women, but air travel is generally considered to be safe for the fetus (Petrikovsky, Terrani, & Sichinava, 2018) . Pregnant air travelers are at greater risk for developing deep vein thrombosis, effects from changes in cabin pressure, and, when visiting tropical climates, can be more affected by the hot climate (Korzeniewski, 2018) . Many infectious diseases, such as respiratory, urinary, vaginal, and gastrointestinal infections, are more likely to occur during travel and often are more severe in pregnant women (CDC, 2020). The greatest risk for pregnancy-related complications during travel is during the first and third trimesters; pregnant travelers should consider identifying a health care facility at their travel destination (CDC, 2020). Also, consideration should paid to the destination's level and availability of medical services because many rural and underdeveloped countries have limited services.",

Men who visit a Zika-endemic area should use condoms or abstain from having sex with a pregnant partner for the remainder of the pregnancy.
