Her other medications included ramipril, aspirin, alfacalcidol, and amiloride. She presented on March 5 with cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral patchy consolidation (Figure 1\na). SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase chain reaction tests from nose and throat viral swabs were positive. Bronchial washing for pneumocystis polymerase chain reaction was negative, as was blood polymerase chain reaction for cytomegalovirus DNA. There was no other positive microbiological diagnosis. She was hypoxic with peripheral oxygen saturation of 86% and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min, so she was transferred to intensive therapy unit (ITU) and commenced noninvasive ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure for type 1 respiratory failure) and subsequent intubation and ventilation as her clinical condition deteriorated. Serum CRP on admission was 83 mg/l, hemoglobin 110 g/l, with normal total white cell count, and mild lymphopenia (lymphocyte count 0.8 \u00d7 109/l). She was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics. No specific antiviral drugs were given. MMF was ceased. Low-dose tacrolimus was initially continued but stopped 1 day before death. On day 3 post admission, she developed acute kidney injury (AKI), with a serum creatinine increase to 225 \u03bcmol/l. She remained stable on the ventilator with reducing oxygen requirements and improvement in lung infiltrates on chest X-ray (Figure 1b) but deteriorated markedly on March 16 with high serum lactate and lactate dehydrogenase levels and an acute rise of CRP to 190. She developed severe metabolic acidosis resistant to correction on continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration, probably owing to an intra-abdominal event (bowel infarction and/or intra-abdominal sepsis). She deteriorated rapidly and died on March 17.",

Of 7 patients, 2 were managed on an outpatient basis and stayed at home, with the remaining 5 (71%) requiring hospital admission. Four among the latter required ITU admission, and 1 is being managed in the renal ward. Of 4 patients sent to ITU, 2 needed intubation and ventilation; the other 2 were managed with oxygen through mask and noninvasive ventilation only. There was 1 death in this small series of 7 patients (mortality rate of 14%). All 3 patients with severe disease were female and also had diabetes. Two patients presented within 3 months of kidney transplantation (1 within 2 weeks) while kidney transplant vintage was 12 months or more in the remaining 5 cases. The patients were managed in 3 centers and the total number of prevalent transplant patients in these centers was 2082, with 32 patients transplanted from December 15, 2019, to March 15, 2020, during the developing pandemic.",

            "text": "Managing immunosuppression in these patients is challenging and should take into account age, severity of COVID-19 infection, associated comorbidities, and time posttransplant. In transplant patients with mild to moderate infections, the usual practice is to continue or make reductions in the dose of immunosuppressive drugs, but this approach might favor high mortality in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 infection. While we acknowledge that firm recommendations are not possible based on the small sample size of this study, we suggest that antiproliferative agents (MMF and azathioprine) should be stopped at the time of admission to hospital, dose of prednisolone should be either unchanged or increased, and tacrolimus dose should be reduced. In severe infections (requiring intubation and ventilation), an argument can be made for stopping calcineurin inhibitors completely while maintaining corticosteroid therapy. The role of cytokine storm and inflammation due to antiviral immune response as a driver of severe respiratory disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome has been discussed since the outbreak of this disease in December 2019, prompting trials of anti-interleukin 6 monoclonal antibody tocilizumab and case for continuing steroids in infected patients. A similar argument can be made for continuing low-dose tacrolimus, but more evidence is needed before drawing firm conclusions. An obvious concern is risk of rejection with reduction in immunosuppression but given the high mortality rate of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized patients, clinicians should focus on keeping their patients alive with a careful case-by-case assessment of risks versus benefits of continuing immunosuppression. With regard to induction treatment, it is likely that lymphocyte-depleting antibodies increase the risk; therefore, many centers in the United Kingdom have stopped performing transplants requiring induction with either antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab. All patients in this series received basiliximab induction therapy at time of transplantations. Five of the 7 patients presented here were receiving triple immunosuppression. Two patients with mild illness who did not require hospital admission and recovered fully at home were on dual immunosuppression (1 on azathioprine plus prednisolone and 1 on tacrolimus plus MMF).",

Two of our patients presented within 3 months after transplantation and 1 presented within 2 weeks. UK National Health Service Blood and Transplant Organ Donation and Transplantation have since produced guidelines on COVID-19 screening in deceased donors and the transplant units are risk stratifying donors and recipients before considering kidney transplantation. Transplantation is a high-risk procedure during this pandemic due to the risk of transmitting COVID-19 infection from the donor to the recipient as well as risk of recipient developing severe disease under higher levels of immunosuppression in the first 3 months posttransplant. We suggest that apart from carefully selecting donor-recipient pairs, transplantation is not advisable during this pandemic, especially for older recipients with comorbidities, in particular diabetes. We have stopped performing living donor transplants and are in discussions to suspend deceased donor program. In addition to significant concerns about the effect of COVID-19 on immunosuppressed patients, increasing worries about access to ITU in the coming weeks and redistribution of staff to critical care to provide support for increasing number of COVID-19 patients, it is likely that deceased donor program will be suspended within most of the UK centers soon.",

Four of 5 patients who required admission had lymphopenia, whereas the 2 who did not need admission had normal lymphocyte counts. As many patients on immunosuppression are likely to have baseline lymphopenia, a further drop in lymphocyte count is likely to be of prognostic value. In our patient who died, both D dimer and troponin levels were elevated on day 3 post admission with further marked increase (in particular D dimer) later during the course of her illness. In the absence of any obvious thromboembolic events, this suggests microvascular thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation with possible gut ischemia. Very high ferritin and D dimer levels were also noted in the case for patient 7 of our series.

            "text": "With regard to specific antiviral therapies, although a recent trial showed no benefit of lopinavir-ritonavir in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, it remains possible that treatment with these drugs as well as hydroxychloroquine will be considered in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.14 The choice of calcineurin inhibitor may also have a role to play. Thus, for instance, cyclosporin A has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on proliferation of corona viruses and hepatitis C virus in vitro, while this is not the case for tacrolimus. Cyclosporin A is thought to inhibit the replication of a diverse array of coronaviruses through its impact on cyclophilin A and B.15\n,\n16 While this needs further exploration, we do not think switching to cyclosporine A from tacrolimus can be recommended at this stage for transplant patients with COVID-19 infection.",

Lymphopenia, very high ferritin and D dimer levels, and raised troponin levels are seen in severe disease and may be of prognostic value. These tests should be part of routine testing in kidney transplant patients requiring hospital admission for COVID-19 infection. We suggest suspending kidney transplantation during the COVID-19 pandemic particularly for high-risk older recipients with comorbidities. Rigorous adherence to hand hygiene, recommended isolation procedures, and regular assessment\u2014virtually and/or telephonically\u2014of transplant patients will help reduce the incidence and facilitate management of mild-to-moderate cases in the community as we could in 2 of our 7 patients described.",
