Characterization of pathogen transmission events from wildlife to humans remains an important scientific challenge hampered by pathogen detection limitations in wild species. Disease spillover is probably vastly under-reported, particularly in remote regions where people have limited access to healthcare. Zoonotic disease spillover events are also difficult to detect, especially if the disease spectrum includes mild or non-specific symptoms, or if there is limited to no human-to-human transmission. While the common characteristics of zoonotic diseases have advanced an understanding of disease transmission between animals and humans [4\u20137], efforts to date have been hampered by sparse data.",

Moving from individual circumstances to larger scale drivers requires a historical account of how humans have altered the nature of their contact with animals with implications for zoonotic spillover risk. Domestication of animals, human encroachment into habitats high in wildlife biodiversity and hunting of wild animals have been proposed as key anthropogenic activities driving infectious disease emergence at the global scale [12,13]. Many of these same anthropogenic activities have been implicated as the drivers of wildlife population declines and extinction risk. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species [14] is the authority on global population trends for species, as well as criteria for a species to be listed as threatened with extinction. For the many threatened mammal species, these IUCN metrics provide valuable context for large-scale anthropogenic activities implicated in species declines (e.g. decline in habitat quality for a species), and specific animal\u2013human contact (e.g. exploitation of a species). Here we combine data on all zoonotic viruses detected in terrestrial mammalian species with IUCN metrics on trends in species abundance and threats identified in species declines in order to relate broad-scale patterns in species abundance to spillover risk. By systematically evaluating published data on wild and domesticated mammalian species that have viruses in common with humans, we show that species abundance and specific extinction threats are related to the number of viruses shared with humans across mammalian species, with important implications for understanding virus spillover risk.",

Among 142 zoonotic viruses examined, 139 viruses had at least one mammalian host reported at the species level based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation or serology (electronic supplementary material, Data File S1.) We assumed that detection of a zoonotic virus by PCR or serology indicates the potential for that species to serve as a source of virus spillover to humans, by direct or indirect transmission, in the past or at some point in the future. The number of viruses detected in each mammalian species was summed to estimate zoonotic virus richness for each species.

This resource includes a list of all mammalian species, Red List categories based on extinction risk, most recently documented population trend (decreasing, stable or increasing), and criteria for listing in IUCN threatened categories, as assessed from 2004 to 2013. There are five categories of Red List status based on extinction risk. For this analysis, two categories of extinction risk, least concern (LC) and near threatened (NT), were expanded into six categories based on IUCN classifications for increasing, decreasing and stable population trend (table 1). Decreasing population trend correlated almost perfectly with population reduction (criterion A) for threatened species, so threatened species were not further categorized according to population trend. Estimates of global abundance were obtained from open sources for humans [15] and domesticated species [16]. Domesticated species were categorized as LC, population increasing.\n",

First, we quantified research publications available in PubMed for each mammalian species in our dataset, and log number of PubMed publications was included in multivariable modelling. Second, we created a data deficient/unknown trend category for each mammalian species in our dataset using IUCN classifications. When there is inadequate information available to make a population assessment, the IUCN classifies some terrestrial mammalian species as data deficient (DD, n = 790). In addition, population trend was unknown for many species, including some NT (n = 57) and LC species (n = 1371). Species lacking enough data to be categorized according to listing criteria, as well as NT and LC species lacking population trend data, were combined into a data deficient/unknown trend category for analyses (table 1). Our assumption for analyses is that species with less population information were potentially less investigated with respect to zoonotic diseases. Combined measures of threatened status, population trend and data deficiency were summarized as \u2018conservation status' (table 1).",

Less common wildlife species, categorized with increasingly threatened status by the IUCN Red List, were implicated with significantly fewer viruses shared with people, compared to widespread and abundant wild mammalian species. Terrestrial wild animal species of least concern with increasing population trends (n = 58) were reported with significantly more zoonotic viruses, while species with decreasing population trends (n = 391) had significantly fewer zoonotic viruses, compared to species with stable population trends (n = 1281). After adjusting for all factors, we detected a dose-response type relationship between increasingly threatened conservation status and a corresponding decrease in the number of viruses mammals share with humans. The gradual decrease in incidence rate ratios as species abundance declines from least concern conservation status with increasing population trend to critically endangered provides evidence for this trend (table 2). With the exception of species categorized as threatened owing to over-exploitation and habitat loss, this trend can be summarized as follows; species of least concern with increasing abundance were estimated with 1.5 times the number of zoonotic viruses, while species of least concern with decreasing abundance had three-fourths the number of viruses, species not threatened, but decreasing in abundance had one-third the number of viruses, vulnerable species had less than one-sixth the number of viruses, endangered species had one-seventh the number of viruses, and critically endangered had one-thirteenth the number of viruses, compared to species of least concern that were stable in abundance. In an additional analysis of a subset of species that were not found to be data deficient, we found conservation status had a positive linear relationship with the number of zoonotic viruses reported in a species (data shown in the electronic supplementary material).",

In fact, threatened species listed because of very small area of occupancy (IUCN Red List criteria B2), and very small or restricted populations (IUCN Red List criteria D2) have yet to be reported with any zoonotic viruses (figure 2).

Endangered and critically endangered species include many of the most charismatic and intensively managed species in the world, and thus we expected opportunities for virus spillover from species to be more frequent from these species. To further evaluate disparities in zoonotic virus richness among threatened species, we assessed the Red List's listing criteria and sub-criteria in a multivariable modelling approach and found that threatened species for which a population reduction was directly observed (IUCN Red List criteria A1(a), A2 (a) or A4 (a), n = 53 species) were predicted to host over 2 times as many zoonotic viruses, compared to species listed as threatened by other means when all other variables were accounted for in the model (table 2). Wildlife populations with declines that have been directly observed were probably more closely monitored to be able to detect changes in population abundance, and often, long-term monitoring programmes accompany species management plans, thereby increasing the likelihood of disease detection and reporting. Also, intensive and often hands-on wildlife management can increase opportunities for pathogen transmission from animals to humans, supporting a biological basis for increased spillover risk beyond increased detection. Direct and indirect contact with wildlife in management and ecotourism settings is a recognized risk for zoonotic spillover, along with increased occupational risk among veterinarians and researchers attending to wildlife [4].",

Anthropogenic activities that have altered the landscape, such as forest fragmentation, development and conversion to cropland, have caused declines in wildlife habitat quality, and, as with exploitation, are likely to also increase the probability of animal\u2013human interactions during and subsequent to land conversion activities [26,27]. Human encroachment into biodiverse areas increases the risk of spillover of novel infectious diseases by enabling new contacts between humans and wildlife [28]. Slightly more than half of all threatened species (54.8%) were listed by IUCN because of the impacts of exploitation or habitat loss on species abundance indicating that this is a major impetus for species reductions. Our analysis incorporating data on species declines globally provides broad-scale support for convergent processes whereby exploitation of wildlife and habitat loss have caused wildlife population declines, as well as facilitated the transmission of animal viruses to humans that most likely occurred prior to and during large-scale losses in abundance.",

We find that domesticated species status had the largest influence on the number of mammalian viruses shared with humans with eight times more zoonotic viruses predicted in a given domesticated mammal species compared to wild mammalian species (table 2). Domesticated species harboured an average of 19.3 zoonotic viruses (min 5, max 31) compared to wild species with a mean of 0.23 viruses (min 0, max 16). The top 10 mammalian species with the highest number of viruses shared with humans included eight domesticated species: pigs (n = 31 zoonotic viruses), cattle (n = 31 zoonotic viruses), horses (n = 31 zoonotic viruses), sheep (n = 30 zoonotic viruses), dogs (n = 27 zoonotic viruses), goats (n = 22 zoonotic viruses), cats (n = 16 zoonotic viruses) and camels (n = 15 zoonotic viruses). Aside from humans, accurate detection and reporting of zoonotic viruses would be most probable in domesticated species, given the economic and public health demand for these data. More accurate detection in domesticated species is supported by the minimal change in estimated number of viruses in regression models with the number of publications (table 2) and without the number of publications as an adjustment for reporting bias (electronic supplementary material, table S3). The only wild animals among the top 10 species with detected zoonotic viruses were the house mouse (Mus musculus) and the black rat (Rattus rattus), with 16 and 14 zoonotic viruses, respectively. Both of these species in the Rodentia order are considered invasive in most regions of the world, commonly inhabit domestic and peri-domestic structures, and have dubious non-domestication status given their use in laboratory studies and as pets worldwide. Sympatry, or spatial overlap of hosts, was highly correlated with cross-species transmission among rodents, and network analyses illustrate that the global distribution of the house mouse has facilitated the transmission of viruses to sympatric species around the world [29].",

Notably, domestic animals are among the most central species in the viral sharing network. Viruses in domesticated species were not only commonly shared with other domesticated species but also with wild animal species within respective Cetartiodactyla and Carnivora orders (figure 3). While directionality in historical transmission of viruses between wild mammals and their domesticated kin can only be inferred, we postulate that wild mammals were the original host for the majority of viruses, sharing viruses with domesticated species over centuries of coevolution and domestication. Artiodactyl wild ungulates have been a dominant source of food throughout history and share habitat with domesticated kin. Close phylogenetic relatedness between globally distributed domesticated species and their wild perissodactyl, artiodactyl and carnivore brethren has probably intensified opportunities for cross-species pathogen transmission [30]. Primate, rodent and bat species appear to harbour zoonotic viruses that are not well connected to domesticated species and other wild animal species (figure 3), supporting the premise that these species share zoonotic viruses directly with humans, without domesticated amplifying hosts facilitating viral sharing among species in other orders.\n",

By contrast, Diprotodontia (marsupials) and Eulipotyphla (shrews, moles, hedgehogs) had fewer zoonotic viruses detected by the time of this study than species in other orders. A recent study evaluating the relationship between phylogeny and the proportion of viruses likely to be zoonotic for a given species also found that bats hosted significantly more zoonotic viruses than other orders and that primates drove the phylogenetic effect as a determinant of zoonotic spillover [5]. The close phylogenetic relationship of humans with non-human primates is recognized as a causal factor underlying spillover, reverse zoonoses and the coevolution of occasionally shared viruses [31]. Bats have also been repeatedly implicated as the source of recent emerging infectious disease events involving high consequence pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [32], Nipah virus encephalitis [33], and hemorrhagic fevers caused by filoviruses [34,35], and have been noted previously to host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents [10]. Viral sharing has been shown to be more common among bat species than among rodent species and several bat traits have been associated with a higher propensity for cross-species transmission, including gregariousness (roosting in high densities) and migration [29]. With nearly a quarter of bat species lacking sufficient data for categorization of their IUCN Red List status, bats are probably still under-represented in field investigations and warrant future dedicated focus for emerging infectious disease research.",

Our data also provide new evidence that threatened wildlife species with limited extent of occurrence and small population sizes have shared relatively fewer viruses with humans, supporting the concept that virus spillover risk at this large scale is underpinned by the probability of animal\u2013human interactions. Reservoir populations have a critical population or community size required for infectious disease transmission [37], and generally larger populations are more likely to propagate cycles of infection. Population range size similarly reflects opportunities for animal contact, and species with larger ranges should have increased potential to overlap in range, and possibly share habitat with other species, enabling cross-species transmission and increasing the risk of spillover to humans [29]. However, determinants identified as predictors of zoonotic virus richness at this scale might not relate to zoonotic virus diversity in species at the local scale. Larger population size together with higher population density have been shown to positively correlate with higher viral richness among primate species [22], consistent with disease transmission mechanisms that are dependent on population densities and distributions.",

            "text": "Given we detected a significant increase in zoonotic virus richness among more globally abundant species, additional mechanisms underlying trends in wildlife populations warrant investigation. Species that have increased in abundance and even expanded their range despite large-scale anthropogenically driven landscape change and urbanization [38] are more likely to be generalist species that have adapted to human-dominated landscapes. Approximately one quarter of mammalian species had stable or increasing trends in abundance at the time of analysis, half of which were rodents [14]. While urbanization and landscape change towards crop production could decrease biodiversity overall, these activities can increase the abundance of select species [39]. Many species listed as least concern with increasing abundance by the IUCN Red List are adaptable wild mammalian species that have benefitted from a close relationship with humans. These species could have habitat and dietary niches that overlap with humans in dwellings or in agricultural practices, further enabling direct and indirect contact with similarly adapted sympatric species, domesticated species and humans. In particular, dwellings and agricultural settings are among the most high risk of interfaces for zoonotic viral transmission, particularly from rodents [4]. Pathogen transmission among animals thriving in human-dominated landscapes can also benefit from higher community size and density-dependent viral transmission, especially when resources that sustain mammal populations are aggregated [40], further increasing the probability of human contact with infectious reservoirs in these landscapes. With ongoing landscape transformation towards human-dominated landscapes and approximately half of the world's human population living in urbanized communities [41], species that are adaptable to human modified habitat are likely to continue to be an important source of zoonotic pathogen transmission [40].",

The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species criteria for categorizing species status [14] was used here to represent large-scale animal\u2013human interactions involved in spillover that could not be measured directly at the species level across all mammalian species. Refined measures of wild animal interactions with people that could constitute effective contact for disease transmission are needed at the local level that can also be scaled up to evaluate broader patterns in spillover risk. We included both serological and molecular data in our analyses, as well as an adjustment for reporting bias, because we were especially concerned about missing host\u2013virus associations. Disease surveillance has been very limited for many wildlife species to date, and wildlife reservoir status can be difficult to ascertain, particularly for viruses with a very short duration of shedding, after which antibodies might only be detectable by serology. Our model findings were robust to detection bias overall, with the same significant factors explaining variation in species propensity to host zoonotic viruses retaining a similar relative effect and significance even when the number of PubMed publications was not accounted for in the model (electronic supplementary material, table S3). Nonetheless, large-scale surveillance efforts are necessary to more specifically identify epidemiologically relevant animal reservoirs for zoonotic viruses, as well as the periods of heightened shedding that might be related to specific host traits and environmental factors measured at the species level. Wild animal hosts for zoonotic viruses have been vastly under-recognized because the majority of species have not been sampled at the level needed to detect zoonotic viruses, and many geographical regions lack adequate data for modelling [5].",

Global patterns in spillover risk reflect close contact interactions between wildlife and humans that occur in a myriad of circumstances around the world. While we shed light on the patterns of zoonotic viruses that have been reported up through the time of this study, we suspect that pathogen spillover often goes unnoticed, with only a proportion of spillover events expanding into outbreaks in people that are subsequently detectable. The evidence of serologic exposure to zoonotic pathogens with high mortality in humans, such as filoviruses, in areas not previously recognized with outbreaks, supports the premise that zoonotic pathogen exposure is more common than recognized [42]. Surveillance for acute febrile illness among people engaged in high-risk activities involving animals, especially wildlife, is a priority to enable more rapid detection of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Surveillance activities that include animals and humans in close contact situations will advance outbreak preparedness in between outbreaks and assist in prioritizing in-depth, longitudinal field studies needed to understand epidemiological patterns in virus transmission and optimize disease prevention actions. Informed mitigation efforts aimed at ensuring biosafety in livestock production, minimizing interactions between wildlife and domesticated animals and limiting close contact with wildlife are especially needed given global trends in urbanization and food production. One Health surveillance approaches are needed that integrate animal and human health in monitoring for emerging infectious diseases and consider environmental change that is likely to intensify close proximity animal\u2013human interactions in the near future.",
