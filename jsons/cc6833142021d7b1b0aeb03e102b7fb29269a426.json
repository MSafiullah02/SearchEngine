            "text": "Transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 activates the spike protein of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In vitro, activation induces virus-cell membrane fusion at the cell surface. However, the roles of TMPRSS2 during coronavirus infection in vivo are unclear. Here, we used animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection to investigate the role of TMPRSS2. Th1-prone C57BL/6 mice and TMPRSS2-knockout (KO) mice were used for SARS-CoV infection, and transgenic mice expressing the human MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 (hDPP4-Tg mice) and TMPRSS2-KO hDPP4-Tg mice were used for MERS-CoV infection. After experimental infection, TMPRSS2-deficient mouse strains showed reduced body weight loss and viral kinetics in the lungs. Lack of TMPRSS2 affected the primary sites of infection and virus spread within the airway, accompanied by less severe immunopathology. However, TMPRSS2-KO mice showed weakened inflammatory chemokine and/or cytokine responses to intranasal stimulation with poly(I\u00b7C), a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist. In conclusion, TMPRSS2 plays a crucial role in viral spread within the airway of murine models infected by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and in the resulting immunopathology. IMPORTANCE Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against highly pathogenic coronaviruses and other emerging viruses are desirable to enable a rapid response to pandemic threats. Transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), a protease belonging to the type II transmembrane serine protease family, cleaves the coronavirus spike protein, making it a potential therapeutic target for coronavirus infections. Here, we examined the role of TMPRSS2 using animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. The results suggest that lack of TMPRSS2 in the airways reduces the severity of lung pathology after infection by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Taken together, the results will facilitate development of novel targets for coronavirus therapy.",

Thus, active-site inhibitors of TMPRSS2 are potential therapeutic targets for not only influenza viruses but also coronaviruses (17) . Some animal studies show that TMPRSS2-knockout (KO) mice are protected against severe pathology and death after influenza virus infection (18) (19) (20) (21) . In addition, a genetic study revealed that those with high expression of certain TMPRSS2 variants are at increased risk of severe outcomes after infection with A (H1N1) pdm09 influenza (22) . However, the roles of TMPRSS2 in vivo during coronavirus infection are unclear. Here, we used animal models of coronavirus infection to examine the role of TMPRSS2.",

The animals were moribund due to severe pulmonary edema caused by skewing the immune response toward a Th2 profile after infection by mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (23, 24) . We used adult C57BL/6 mice because the TMPRSS2-KO mice were backcrossed to this strain (20) . After infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV, Th1-prone C57BL/6 mice developed acute pneumonia, with around 15% body weight loss; however, this was not fatal. In addition, we recently generated an animal model of MERS-CoV using transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 (hDPP4-Tg mice) under the control of an endogenous promoter (25) . The hDPP4-Tg mice were susceptible to infection by MERS-CoV and developed acute pneumonia with transient loss of body weight. Next, we generated TMPRSS2-KO hDPP4-Tg (TMPRSS2-KO Tg) mice by crossing male hDPP4-Tg mice with female TMPRSS2-KO mice.",

To screen the generated Tg mice and TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice, we confirmed the presence of the transgene of hDPP4 and absence of the TMPRSS2 gene by PCR analysis using two primer sets specific for hDPP4 and TMPRSS2 (Fig. 1) . The mice were then used to examine the role of TMPRSS2 after MERS-CoV infection. After intranasal inoculation with human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC) 2012 (MERS-CoV), hDPP4-Tg mice showed a temporary and mild loss of body weight (from 6 to 9 days p.i.); however, only very slight changes were observed in TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice (Fig. 5a ). The results of virus titer measurements suggested that the virus replicated more slowly in the lungs of TMPRSS2-KO Tg mice (Fig. 5b) . The lung from one out of five Tg mice contained 10 6.45 TCID 50 /g at day 7 p.i.

The results suggest that TMPRSS2 plays an important role in the early phase of disease (lung infection); in particular, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replicated in the bronchioles.",

The protein sequence of human and mouse TMPRSS2 is conserved, with 78% sequence identity between the two species. In situ hybridization analyses of mouse embryos and adult tissues reveal that TMPRSS2 is expressed in the epithelia lining the gastrointestinal, urogenital, and respiratory tracts, including the bronchi and bronchioles, but not in alveolar epithelium (31) . Kim et al. showed that depletion of TMPRSS2 (the molecule was inactivated by disrupting the serine protease domain through homologous recombination) from mice did not affect development or survival to adulthood, nor were there abnormalities in organ histology or function (32) . While the physiological function of TMPRSS2 is unclear, data suggest that it does regulate sodium currents in lung epithelial cells through proteolytic cleavage of the epithelial sodium channel (33) . We also made the interesting observation that TMPRSS2-deficient mice show weaker, or delayed, inflammatory chemokine and cytokine responses mediated by Toll-like receptor 3.",

Cleavage of HA is critical for viral entry into cells during fusion between the viral and host cell membranes (34) . Serine protease inhibitors such as camostat and aprotinin inhibit both influenza virus replication in human airway epithelial cells and the release of cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-\u2423) into cell supernatants (35) . In addition, animal studies using TMPRSS2-KO mice revealed that TMPRSS2 is essential for the spread and pathogenesis of influenza viruses such as emerging H7N9 and seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 (18) (19) (20) (21) . TMPRSS2 also cleaves the coronavirus spike protein to generate unlocked, fusion-catalyzing forms at the cell surface and facilitate rapid early entry (14, 15, (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) . In addition, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV enter cells via two distinct pathways, TMPRSS2 via the cell surface and cathepsin L via the endosome (13, 14, 16, 37, 41, 42) . A previous antiviral study revealed that a serine protease (TMPRSS2) rather than a cysteine protease (cathepsin L) facilitated the spread of SARS-CoV in the infected mouse (43) . Our findings are in agreement with this study; coronavirus replication in the lungs, especially in the bronchioles, was less pronounced in TMPRSS2-deficient mice. However, viral spread and inflammatory infiltration were still detected in the alveoli. Several proteases, including other serine proteases and the cysteine protease cathepsin L, may activate both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, allowing the virus to spread to alveolar areas in TMPRSS2-deficient mice. In addition, TLR3 mRNA expression in the lungs at 6 h p.i. of SARS-CoV-inoculated TMPRSS2-deficient mice suggested that TLR3, which recognizes specifically dsRNA and localizes to endosomes (44) , recognized viral RNA within the endosomal component. Thus, we speculate that the pathway employing cathepsin L and the endosome mainly contributed to SARS-CoV infection in the TMPRSS2deficient mice.",

This result is similar to results reported for TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4 double-KO mice on day 3 postinfection with H3N2 influenza A virus (49) . High levels of virus replication very likely induce severe tissue damage and increased cellular infiltration by immune cells. Viral replication is likely a major cause of the elevated inflammatory chemokine levels observed in WT mice; nevertheless, we assessed the possibility that TMPRSS2, a serine protease, may also contribute to inflammatory reactions after TLR3 stimulation. Intranasal administration of poly(I\u00b7C) induced expression of MCP-1, KC, IL-1\u2423, IL-1\u2424, and IL-12 in the lungs of WT mice but not in those of TMPRSS2-KO mice. The genetic backgrounds of WT and TMPRSS2-KO mice were the same because the TMPRSS2-KO mice were produced from TMPRSS2 gene knockout C57BL/6 embryonic stem (ES) cells. The physiological function of TMPRSS2 remains unclear; however, TMPRSS2 may contribute to more severe or rapid immunopathology in WT mice by increasing the levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines after TLR3 stimulation. The immune responses to poly(I\u00b7C) treatment in 14-to 16-week-old hDPP4-Tg mice were quite different from those in 14-to 16-week-old WT C57BL/6 mice. The hDPP4-Tg mice were produced from BDF1\u03ebC57BL/6 mice; however, the Tg mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice for eight generations. Thus, the genetic backgrounds were almost the same between these strains. On the other hand, hDPP4 expression did not have a marked effect on basal innate immune responses in 10-week-old C57BL/6 and hDPP4-Tg mice; however, hDPP4-Tg mice showed slightly stronger or earlier innate immune responses than C57BL/6 mice (25). In addition, Simeoni et al. reported that hDPP4/CD26 transgene expression induced major phenotypic changes in T-cell populations within the thymus and peripheral blood of their Tg mice and that peripheral blood T-cell reduction was age dependent (50) . Thus, the compromised immune responses in our hDPP4-Tg mice were possibly due to hDPP4.",

Vero E6 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin G, and 50 g/ml streptomycin (5% FBS-MEM). Stocks of a mouse-passaged Frankfurt 1 isolate of SARS-CoV and F-musX-Vero E6 were propagated twice and titrated on Vero E6 cells prior to cryopreservation at \u03ea80\u00b0C, as previously described (23) . MERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC 2012 strain) was kindly provided by Bart Haagmans and Ron Fochier (Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands). Stocks of MERS-CoV were propagated twice, titrated on Vero E6 cells, and cryopreserved at \u03ea80\u00b0C. Viral infectivity titers are expressed as the TCID 50 per milliliter on Vero E6 cells and were calculated according to the Behrens-K\u00e4rber method. All work with infectious SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was performed under biosafety level 3 conditions. Generation of mice. TMPRSS2 \u03ea/\u03ea mice were established from TMPRSS2 gene knockout C57BL/6 embryonic stem (ES) cells (product number VG13341), which were obtained from the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP) Repository (University of California Davis). The ES cells were injected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts, and chimeric mice with a complete C57BL/6 genetic background were generated. TMPRSS2 \u03ea/\u03ea mice with a homologous genotype were obtained by crossing male and female TMPRSS2 \u03e9/\u03ea C57BL/6 mice (20) .",
