Abdominal radiography, including double contrast cystography, is used to evaluate size, number and location. Uroliths detected on plain films may be too large to be removed by catheter; because the size of uroliths retrieved is limited by catheter diameter. The largest diameter which does not traumatise the animal should be used. Ideal catheters are soft and flexible. The animal is placed in lateral recumbency and the well-lubricated catheter advanced so its tip does not interfere with bladder wall movement. If necessary the bladder is moderately distended with saline. The urine/ saline is aspirated into a syringe while an assistant vigorously and repeatedly moves the animal's abdomen up and down. This causes uroliths in the dependent portion of the bladder to disperse throughout the liquid. They are then drawn into the syringe. This procedure is repeated several times if necessary. Care must be taken not to over distend the bladder. ",

The bitch had mated but had never conceived. Signs of oestrus had been present for four months. Vaginoscopy revealed crenated longitudinal folds of the walls characteristic of oestrus. Ampicillin was given to treat the open pyometra. Ultrasonography demonstrated a lobulated right ovary with no follicles. On the basis of these findings and oestrogen levels, persistent follicular cysts were diagnosed. This did not respond to HGT treatment. The follicular cysts were aspirated and 65 ml purulent uterine fluid withdrawn during exploratory laparotomy. All signs resolved in six weeks. Two months later the vaginal discharge returned. Ovariohysterectomy was performed. Histological examination of the uterus confirmed cystic endometrial hyperplasia. Degenerating corpora lutea with no follicles were found in the right ovary. ",
