Fever, dry cough, malaise, lethargy, shortness of breath, myalgia are the commonest symptoms [2] . Less common symptoms are headache, productive cough and diarrhoea. Mild cases may present with a common cold like syndrome, whilst severe cases may develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia. According to the WHO 21% of cases in China have a severe illness [2] . Early estimates of the reproduction number, R0, give values around 2.2 with a mean incubation period of 5.2 days [4] , and a range up to 24 days. A review found the average R0 value for COVID-19 to be up to 3.28 and median value to be around 2.79 [5] . A more recent study estimated the Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 to be 2.28 for the Diamond Princess cruise ship [6] . All these estimates are similar to R0 estimates for SARS [7] .",

HCW deaths have already been reported with A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 5 The WHO has issued guidelines for protection of HCWs which recommend contact and droplet precautions for HCWs caring for suspected COVID-19 patients [9]. Specifically, a medical mask is recommended for routine care, while a respirator (airborne precautions) is recommended if HCWs are conducting an aerosol-generating procedure such as endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy or airway suctioning, along with droplet precautions [9] . Droplet precautions includes the recommendation to maintain spatial separation of 1 m (\u22483 ft) with an infected patient, in the belief that large droplets can only spread horizontally to a maximum of 1 m (\u22483 ft) [10] . The initial guidelines released by US Centers for Disease Control recommended a more precautionary approach, which includes the use of a mask by the patient (source control [11] ), and airborne precautions for HCWs [12] .",

Seven out of ten studies are based on modelling and A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 7 among them the extent of horizontal spread of droplets vary between 2 -8 m (\u22486 -26 ft) [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , highlighting differing findings between them, which can be partially attributed to the methodologies employed. Specifically, four of these studies rely on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches that do not account accurately for the multiphase particle-flow interaction physics [14, 15, 18, 20] and three of them model cough as a turbulent jet (continuous ejection with conservation of momentum flux) instead of a turbulent puff (short sudden ejection with conservation of momentum) [15, 18, 20] . The fourth study used Lagrangian modelling for the droplet dispersion and it was acknowledged that this approach assigns a larger momentum to air hence, making it difficult to translate the results into relevant settings for hospital infection control [14] .",

Given the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in both the lower and upper respiratory tract [3] , as well as persistence of the virus in the air 3 hours after aeroslisation [33] , airborne transmission is possible. A recent study showed that seasonal coronaviruses were more commonly emitted in aerosols than in droplets, A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 9 even through normal tidal breathing [34] . It is timely to review the evidence informing the 1 -2 m (\u22483 -6 ft) rule of infection control, which drives guidelines for droplet precautions. Most studies of horizontal transmission of droplets show distances of greater than 2 m (\u22486 ft). The maximum distance recorded in the few available studies is 8 m (\u224826 feet) [19, 35] . We note, although the studies employed very different methodologies and should be interpreted cautiously, they still confirm that the spatial separation limit of 1 m (\u22483 ft) prescribed for droplet precautions, and associated recommendations for staff at ports of entry [10] , are not based on current scientific evidence.",

Some studies cite Jennison (1942) [23] as the evidence in support of the 1 -2 m (\u22483 -6 ft) risk limit. This study used high speed exposure to capture still photographs of the atomising secretions generated by human sneezing, coughing and talking, imaged very close to the mouth. It was concluded that the distance to which the majority of droplets were expelled is 2 -3 ft (\u22481 m) but, no details were provided about how they reached this conclusion. The study acknowledges that the motion picture film used for the experiments was not sensitive enough to capture all the droplets. The lighting technique used inherently selects for the largest sizes of droplets and fluid ligaments, not capturing the rest of the emissions and gas cloud carrying them. The author used still photographs, in which many droplets move out of focus and become unrecordable very quickly, especially using photographic technology from the 1940s. More recent studies have shown the extent of droplet spread to be greater than 2 m (\u22486 ft) [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] 35] , and that infection risk exists well beyond the recommended range of spatial separation.",

There is some agreement that particles with diameters less than 5 \u00b5m are airborne particles but, there is significant variation in the literature when it comes to the classification of the lower size limit of droplets. Wells (1934) [37] considered 100 \u00b5m as the cut-off limit for the droplet route. But, later studies considered a cutoff particle diameter of more than 10 \u00b5m to more than 100 \u00b5m [14, 15, 20] . The World Health Organization (WHO) employs a cut off limit of 5 \u00b5m to differentiate between aerosols (\u22645 \u00b5m) and droplet (>5 \u00b5m) [38] transmission routes. However, even particles with a diameter of more than 10 \u00b5m can remain airborne long enough to not fall under the framework of classification of \"droplet\" route [39] . In addition, the size of a droplet is dynamic and changes within seconds during the transit from the respiratory tract to the environment due to evaporation [39] . A large droplet expelled during coughing or sneezing can become an airborne particle in less than a second [39] and that timescale changes depending on the cloud dynamics of exhalation [17, 19] . Hence, it is not possible to characterize droplet and airborne spread as separate, mutually exclusive modes of transmission and further studies of the risks accounting for combined ambient conditions and patient exhaled cloud are needed.",

They report that as the relative humidity increases the extent of droplet spread decreases [18, 20] , yet the horizontal range of the cloud propelling the drops was found to increase with increase in relative humidity, due to the role of buoyancy of the exhaled cloud [17] . For droplets less than 20 \u00b5m in diameter, local airflow field due to body heat is an important factor in determining the extent of spread since it can lift the droplets upwards into the breathing zone [40] . Studies have also shown that depending on the flow direction and airflow pattern, increasing ventilation rate can effectively A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 11 reduce the risk of long range airborne transmission [41] . Most patients spend the majority of time in normal breathing and can saturate the room air with airborne particles expelled during breathing. Moreover, despite negative pressure isolation conditions, airflow due to door motion can cause breakdown in isolation conditions and as a result pathogen can escape the room and there is probability of infection spread outside the room [42] . In general recent studies show distances reached by potentially pathogen-laden droplets of a continuum of sizes to be far greater than 2 m (\u22486 ft) [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , therefore the probability of infection well beyond the defined risk limit can be significant. For example, SARS was classified as predominantly transmitted through contact and droplet modes, but, aerosolised transmission well beyond 2 m (\u22486 ft) was reported in the Amoy Gardens outbreak [32] .",

We have previously shown that masks do not have clinical efficacy against respiratory infections [43, 44] , and that intermittent use of respirators (which depends on HCWs to assess their own risk and use the device when they judge they are at risk) is as equally ineffective as mask use [44] . A recent trial confirmed there is no difference between targeted respirator use and surgical mask use, but did not have a control arm and so may have shown equal efficacy or inefficacy [45] . Proven efficacy of a respirator is seen when the device is worn continually during the shift [43] . The SARS-CoV-2 has been found in both upper and lower respiratory tract specimens, often early in the upper and later in the lower respiratory tract [3] , which means it can potentially be dispersed in fine, airborne particles. Influenza studies show that in a busy emergency department or hospital ward, airborne particles with viable virus can persist for hours in the air [46] .

We have also shown that airborne precautions are more efficacious in protecting HCWs even against infections assumed to be spread by the droplet route [49] . This further supports the conclusion that infections cannot be neatly separated into droplet versus airborne transmission routes, and that it is likely both airborne and large droplets, carried by the respiratory cloud, are emitted close to the patient and further away. In light of the lack of definitive transmission data for SARS-CoV-2 , as well as persistence of the virus in the air 3 hours after aeroslisation [33] , the precautionary principle in the initial CDC guidance was justified. This includes use of a mask by the patient, for which the limited evidence is supportive [11] . Guidelines should be precautionary in ensuring protection of the occupational health and safety of health workers treating COVID-19 [50] . Although the majority of the studies reviewed point towards horizontal spread of more than 2 m (\u22486 ft), these results cannot be translated directly to hospital settings, as the studies used varying range of assumptions. The recent data on SARS-CoV-2 in a hospital ward shows a distance travelled by the virus of at least 4 m (\u224813 ft), double the assumed safe distance [47] . This review reveals the limited scientific data to inform spatial separation guidelines, and a growing body of evidence that droplet precautions are not appropriate for SARS-CoV-2. Hence, future works on carefully documenting and studying the mechanisms shaping transmission distances are warranted, particularly with experiments over a large number of subjects and a variety of conditions, to update current spatial separation guidelines and the current paradigm of droplet and airborne respiratory transmission routes.

All other situations are considered low risk.The WHO and CDC recommends respirators to protect from SARS in both low and high-risk situations[24,25]. For MERS WHO recommends masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations, CDC recommends respirators in both situations and ECDC recommends a pre-assessment of workplace to decide between mask and respirator in low-risk situations and respirators for high-risk situations[26][27][28]. For COVID-19 WHO recommends masks in low-risk situations and respirators in high-risk situations. The CDC and ECDC initially recommended respirators in both situations, but after PPE shoratges, CDC downgraded to use of masks in low risk situations and ECDC recommended use of mask in case of non-availability of respirators[29][30][31].",
