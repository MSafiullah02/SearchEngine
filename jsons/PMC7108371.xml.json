In RIG-I, the CTD has evolved to engage in a high affinity interaction with a triphosphate group [13, 17, 18\u2022\u2022] present at the dsRNA termini of deposited genomic RNA [19, 20] or replicative intermediates [21] of target viruses (Figure 1\nDetection). In addition to recognizing this chemical moiety, the CTD of RIG-I caps the duplex terminus through stacking interactions with terminal base pairs [9, 10\u2022, 11\u2022, 22]. Once bound to its target RNA, RIG-I becomes competent for ATP hydrolysis and downstream signaling.",

The CTD of MDA5 contains a shallow binding surface that forms sequence-independent interactions with the minor groove of target RNAs and accommodates a continuous RNA backbone. Further, the CTD of one MDA5 molecule can form a cooperative binding interface with the insertion domain of a neighbor [7]. Multiple cooperative binding interactions result in a propensity for oligomerization, causing MDA5 to form long filaments along RNA duplexes [24] (Figure 1\nDetection). These filaments may cause clustering of the CARDs of MDA5, making them competent to engage in immune signaling.",

The mutant form of the influenza virus lacks the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) gene, which is a potent inhibitor of RIG-I signaling [26]. In cells infected with the influenza A virus lacking the NS1 gene, the RLRs localize to speckle-like structures known as stress granules [25\u2022\u2022]. Stress granule formation is induced by genomic RNA of the influenza virus [25\u2022\u2022], indicating that there is a specific mechanism by which the cell compartmentalizes pathogenic RNA. Furthermore, the appearance of stress granules correlates with the RIG-I mediated interferon response in the cell [25\u2022\u2022]. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic stress granules are compartments containing viral RNAs that are accessible to the RLRs during the anti-viral response.",

Analysis of the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions of the cell revealed the presence of RIG-I in the membrane during acute infection while RIG-I was strictly observed in the cytoplasm in mock treated cells. Additional experiments monitoring fluorescently tagged RIG-I revealed that it is localized to the perinuclear region of the cell, which is near the site of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) [27\u2022\u2022, 28]. Concomitant with localization to the membranes, RIG-I associates with the ubiquitin ligase, TRIM25, and the adapter protein, 14-3-3\u025b [27\u2022\u2022]. These protein associations are necessary for localization of RIG-I to the membrane [27\u2022\u2022]. Recruitment of RIG-I to the MAMs allows for interaction with MAVs and initiation of anti-viral signaling [27\u2022\u2022].",

Close inspection of confocal micrographs of fluorescently tagged RIG-I [25\u2022\u2022, 27\u2022\u2022, 29] reveals its distribution throughout the cytoplasm and slightly in the nucleus. In support of this observation, an amino-terminal variant of MDA-5 can also localize to the nucleus after stimulation with pro-apoptotic factors that induce cleavage of the CARDs [30].

The 5\u2032 triphosphate is an important determinant for RIG-I recognition, so the removal or modification of this moiety is an effective strategy for evading RIG-I detection. For example, Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHV), which belong to the Bunyaviridae family of negative strand RNA viruses, do not trigger interferon production [38]. In contrast, viruses from the same family, such as Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and LaCross virus (LACV), trigger a RIG-I-dependent innate immune response via RIG-I binding to the 5\u2032 triphosphorylated viral genomes [20, 38]. To evade detection by RIG-I, the 5\u2032 triphosphates of the HTNV and CCHV genomes are removed during a \u2018prime and realign\u2019 process whereby the first nucleotide is cleaved by an exonuclease, leaving a 5\u2032 monophosphate [40]. Compounding this effect, negative strand viruses such as HTNV and CCHV do not produce substantial amounts of dsRNA [40, 41], thereby eluding MDA-5 detection.",

It is assumed that neither RIG-I nor MDA-5 recognize these cap structures, which are comprised of a 7-methylguanosine linked to the first nucleotide through a 5\u2032\u20135\u2032 triphosphate bridge. Viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm have evolved machinery that is designed to cap and methylate viral RNA in order to appear like host RNA and thereby evade receptor recognition. In these cases, viral RNA is capped using cellular machinery, viral encoded cap machinery, or by a cap snatching mechanism [42]. For example coronavirus strains with an inactivated cap-methylating enzyme (2\u2032-O-methyltransferase) induce higher levels of type I interferon production compared to wild-type virus in human macrophages and in mice, in an MDA-5 dependent manner [43\u2022\u2022]. The 2\u2032-O-methylation at the 5\u2032 cap appears to be a molecular feature that is critical for the distinction of self and non-self RNA by MDA-5, and it is readily exploited by the coronavirus.",

SARS-CoV induces formation of double-membrane vesicles on an altered endoplasmic reticulum, as revealed by electron tomography images of infected cells [45]. Duplex RNA localizes to the interior of these vesicles, suggesting a mechanism by which host cell membranes are reorganized by SARS-CoV to conceal viral RNAs from cytoplasmic RLRs.

For example, the first reported studies of genetic variation in human RLRs [48] show that patterns of variation within the protein domains differ greatly among the three RLRs, supporting the notion that they each recognize significantly different PAMPs and are under different levels and types of selection. Intriguingly, diversity of RIG-I is the most strictly constrained, consistent with increasing evidence that it has other functions in the cell [25\u2022\u2022, 27\u2022\u2022, 29, 30]. Patterns of sequence variation within the individual RLRs provide a window into the diversification of RNA binding modes. For example, geographically distinct human populations display variation within RNA binding domains of RIG-I, particularly at amino acids of the CTD and Hel2i that directly contact the 5\u2032-triphosphate and duplex region of RNA PAMPS, respectively, suggesting that RIG-I has been tuned to recognize subtle alterations in viral RNA structures.",

Myxomatosis (MYXV) is lethal for some rabbits (European rabbits), while others (American cottontails and brush rabbits) are not highly susceptible.

For RIG-I, the most pronounced variation occurs at the terminus of pincer, and in the linker that connects pincer to the CTD, and at the connection between Hel1 and CARD2.

            "text": "An elegant structure-based analysis of RIG-I variation among diverse mammals also suggests that the pincer domain plays an important role in coupling RNA binding to signaling, and perhaps in tuning specificity for various RNAs [50\u2022\u2022]. Alternatively, the pincer variations may indicate sites of interaction with other proteins, which may allosterically regulate the RLR signaling apparatus [50\u2022\u2022]. Intriguingly, multiple studies [48, 50\u2022\u2022] have noted sequence variation along the outer surface of Hel2i as it appears in recent crystal structures. While this has been attributed to a potential interaction interface between Hel2i and other proteins, the same amino acids are actually located at the intramolecular interface between Hel2i and CARD2, which has been crystallographically visualized in truncated versions of the RIG-I protein [10\u2022]. Prior to binding of RNA and ATP, the CARDs can dock against Hel2i [12, 14], and therefore any sequence variation at this position will affect release of the CARDs and downstream signaling.",

RIG-I specifically recognizes and binds to the 5\u2032 triphosphorylated, blunt-end termini of viral RNA targets. MDA5 recognizes long, double-strand RNA and forms cooperative filaments along internal regions of target duplexes. Once bound to RNA, these proteins can initiate an immune response through activation of the mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS. In addition to monitoring the cytoplasm for viral RNA, RIG-I has been observed in the perinuclear space, stress granules, and at membrane boundaries between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, potentiating interactions with viruses that localize to subcellular compartments. Evasion: Viral strategies to avoid detection. Many viruses have developed strategies to evade RLR recognition, including removing or occluding the triphosphate moiety, 5\u2032 end capping their RNA, and masking duplex regions via binding of viral proteins. RIG-I is shown in red, MDA5 in green, MAVS in cyan, viral proteins in purple, and an endogenous RNA cap structure in pink. Phosphates are represented by yellow circles. The area within the dashed circle represents a stress granule.",
