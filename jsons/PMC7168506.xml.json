            "text": "Ribosomal recruitment to the mRNA is a crucial step in protein synthesis and is a known target for translational control.1 In eukaryotic cells, there are two main mechanisms of ribosomal recruitment: (i) cap\u2010dependent translation, which most cellular mRNAs use as the standard mode of translation and involves the assembly of the preinitiation translational complex at the m7GpppX 5\u2032 cap structure (Me7GTP) of mRNA, where X is any nucleotide; and (ii) cap\u2010independent translation, which is a process that is initiated through direct interaction of the translational machinery with an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) element within RNA. This mechanism is used by plus\u2010stranded viral RNAs and by several dozen capped eukaryotic mRNAs that possess IRES in their 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR).2, 3, 4 The first step in eukaryotic translation involves the preparation of a group of small ribosomal subunits (Fig. 1A). The two subunits of the ribosome tend to remain associated under normal physiological conditions, though some studies indicate the presence of a heterogeneous population of particles.5 Binding of initiation factors eIF3 and eIF1A to the 40S subunit, however, leads to disassembly and formation of a pool of small ribosomal subunits.6 Next, the 40S\u2022eIF3\u2022eIF1A complex binds to the initiator tRNA (Met\u2010tRNAi) associated with the eIF2\u00b7GTP complex, which has specific sites for binding to both the 40S subunit and ribosomal\u2010bound eIF36 (Fig. 1B). Recruitment of the small ribosome subunit to the 5\u2032 end of mRNA is rate limiting, and highly regulated in the initiation of eukaryotic protein synthesis. This process includes formation of the heterotrimeric translation initiation complex eIF4F and its association with the Me7GTP cap structure of mRNA.7, 8, 9 The eIF4F complex consists of eIF4E (4E), the mRNA cap\u2010binding protein; eIF4A (4A), an RNA\u2010dependent ATPase and helicase that unwinds the secondary structure of mRNA and forces the release of bound proteins from the mRNA 5\u2032 end;6 and eIF4G (4G), a scaffolding protein that serves a docking function in the assembly of the eIF4F complex and associates with the 40S ribosomal subunit through contact with the adapter complex eIF3.9, 10 (Fig. 1C). After eIF4As\u2014the activity of ATPase and helicase is stimulated by eIF4B,11 a small RNA\u2010binding protein that is involved in ribosomal recruitment to mRNA, eIF4F executes the bridging function between mRNA and the ribosome via cap\u2010eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF3. Although a consensus has not been reached with regard to the sequence of events leading to the assembly of the eIF4F complex on the 5\u2032\u2010mRNA cap, most experimental results favor a model in which the interaction with the cap structure takes place after the 4F complex has been assembled.2, 6 The 40S ribosome along with its associated initiation factors scans the 5\u2032 UTR until it encounters an initiation codon (AUG or a cognate) (Fig. 1C). Thereafter, the 60S ribosome joins to form the active 80S ribosome.2, 6\nRelease of the 40S subunit and binding to eIF3 and eIF1A.Binding of eIF2\u00b7GTP\u00b7Met\u2010tRNAi to the 40S complex.Binding of mRNA to the 40S complex.\n",

Thus, each of the proteins involved in the regulation of cap\u2010dependent translation could be considered as an anticancer target. This review will focus on the biological role and biochemical and structural characteristics of one of these proteins, eIF4E. In addition, we will survey major advances, challenges, and future directions of the design and development of antagonists of eIF4E as a potential anticancer target.",

            "text": "Under physiological conditions, the availability of eIF4E is tightly regulated.25, 30, 31 eIF4E is negatively regulated by the 4E\u2010binding proteins (4E\u2010BPs). Under normal physiological conditions, eIF4E is bound by 4E\u2010BPs, a family of inhibitory proteins that sequester eIF4E by occupying the same binding site as eIF4G32, 33, 34 (Fig. 3A). Upon trophic stimulation, 4E\u2010BPs are phosphorylated at multiple sites through the RAS\u2010extracellular signal\u2010regulated kinase (RAS\u2010ERK) and PI3 kinase/ATK signaling pathways.35, 36 Phosphorylation releases 4E\u2010BPs from eIF4E and thereby enables the assembly of eIF4F complex followed by the delivery of mRNAs to the eIF4F complex.15, 37, 38 Support for this conclusion has been demonstrated by the treatment of cancer cells with rapamycin and inhibitor of mTOR, which results in 4E\u2010BP dephosphorylation and cancer cell growth inhibition.39 (Fig. 3B). The hypophosphorylated 4E\u2010BPs bind tightly to eIF4E\u2014which cannot form the eIF4F trimer\u2014thus inhibiting cap\u2010dependent translation initiation.39 Taken together, these results demonstrate that antagonism of eIF4F formation is a potential anticancer approach. Moreover, antagonists of eIF4F formation will not inhibit the translation of all mRNA equally; rather this antagonism will have a disproportionate effect on the translation of those mRNA that are most dependent on the activity of eIF4F. In general, most \u201concogenic\u201d mRNAs fall into this category and display differential sensitivity to eIF4F antagonism.40 In addition, the inhibition of cap\u2010dependent translation should have minimal impact on internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)\u2010mediated translation, conferring further selectivity. Although some reports suggest that inhibition of apoptosis and translation during hypoxia in cancer cells involves IRES\u2010mediated translation,41, 42, 43 this topic is beyond the scope of this review.",

Phosphorylation of eIF4E (usually at Ser 209) is mediated by the MAP kinase\u2010interacting protein kinase\u20101 (Mnk\u20101). Mnk\u20101 in turn is activated by the RAS\u2010regulated MAPK/ERK and p38/Jnk kinase\u2010signaling pathways.45 This process is facilitated by eIF4E binding to eIF4G\u2014an event that brings eIF4E into proximity to the Mnk\u20101 kinase.36 Phosphorylation of eIF4E is associated with the concomitant activation of cap\u2010dependent translation and expression of the transformed phenotype.46, 47 However, the mechanism by which phosphorylation of eIF4E leads to increased translation and the role of phosphorylated eIF4E in cancer initiation and maintenance remains controversial. To promote tumorigenesis, eIF4E must be phosphorylated at Ser 209,48, 49 indicating that the mechanism of translational activation by eIF4E phosphorylation is not directly associated with the cap\u2010binding function of eIF4E. Increased levels of phosphorylated eIF4E have been detected in about 60% of cancers51 and in a broad spectrum of cancer cell lines.46 Active eIF4E phosphorylation is required for overexpressed eIF4E to cooperate with deregulated Myc to promote mouse lymphomagenesis.52 Together, these data support the speculation that increased phosphorylation of eIF4E may be on the cancer pathway. However, neither tumor progression nor aggressiveness correlates with the level of eIF4E phosphorylation.46 These findings indicate that the role of eIF4E phosphorylation in oncogenesis requires further investigation.",

Other methods of evaluating eIF4E antagonist binding have also been developed, including surface plasmon resonance (SPR),50 isothermal titration calorimetry63, 64, and NMR.54 Previous studies have led to a proposed two\u2010step binding mechanism in which an eIF4E\u00b7m7GpppG* complex is formed in the first step accompanied by reduced eIF4E fluorescence, followed by a presumably complex reorganized second step with even lower fluorescence (Scheme\n1).65 The first step is dominated by ligand binding, via the triphosphate moiety, to basic residues (Arg157 and Lys162). In the second step, binding of the m7G base to the hydrophobic tryptophan\u2010binding pocket is thought to result in a further decrease in fluorescence.

Along these lines, Kentsis and co\u2010workers reported the direct binding of ribavirin to eIF4E with an apparent K\nd of 8.4 \u03bcM in vitro using a fluorescence\u2010quenching assay, while the ribavirin analog 1\u2010\u03b2\u2010D\u2010ribofuranosyl\u20101,2,3\u2010triazole\u20104\u2010carboxamide (Rib4C), which contains an uncharged 1,2,3\u2010triazole moiety, failed to bind eIF4E.105 More significantly, they demonstrated that RTP and m7GTP bound to eIF4E with nearly equal affinities (K\nd \u223c 0.1 \u03bcM). By using m7G\u2010Sepharose affinity chromatography, they determined that RTP competed with m7G binding to eIF4E with an apparent inhibition constant Ki of 0.3 \u03bcM, which is similar to that from m7GTP.105 Furthermore, ribavirin was found to disrupt the translation of mRNAs regulated by eIF4E posttranscriptionally. Ribavirin treatment caused a reduced level of cyclin D1 with an apparent EC50 (which is the effective concentration needed to reduce the level of cyclin D1 by 50% relative to a control) of 0.1\u20131 \u03bcM. They also showed that ribavirin potently suppressed eIF4E\u2010mediated oncogenic transformation in NIH 3T3 cells with an EC50 of 0.1\u20131 \u03bcM.

Intrigued by Kentsis's work, Westman and co\u2010workers tested ribavirin, RTP, and the dinucleotide RpppG for their ability to inhibit translation in vitro and explored their possible intrinsic relation with eIF4E; a design intended to determine whether these ribavirin\u2010containing analogs could be substitutes for natural caps once incorporated into mRNA. Surprisingly, their in vitro translation assay suggested that these ribavirin\u2010containing compounds did not inhibit translation at concentrations at which conventional cap analogs could effectively block cap\u2010dependent translation, though inhibition was observed at high concentrations (millimolar). However, their work suggested that this inhibition effect at very high concentrations was inconsistent with an action through blocking eIF4E. Experimentally, they also excluded other possibilities that could lead to the poor translation activity, such as metabolic instability of these compounds in the translation system and failure to cap in the incorrect orientation. Furthermore, their independent fluorescence titration experiments suggested very low binding affinity of ribavirin and its derivatives to recombinant murine eIF4E and human recombinant nuclear cap\u2010binding complex, two to four orders of magnitude lower than the values for true cap analogs. Therefore, they hypothesized that it was the guanine, rather than the triazole moiety, that penetrated the binding surface of eIF4E in the case of RpppG. Taking all the evidence together, they conclude that ribavirin is not a structural or functional mimic of the 7\u2010methyl guanosine moiety for translation in vitro, even though ribavirin has confirmed translational inhibition effect in vivo. From our point of view, many\u2014if not all\u2014of these discrepancies are largely due to differing experimental methods and conditions. The field would be greatly advanced if investigators would agree to establish a systematic, standardized set of assays.",

Thus, certain sensitization agents have been used in combination with TRAIL to enhance TRAIL\u2010based cancer therapy.117, 118, 119, 120 Additionally, Panner et al.121, 122 define translational control as a new mechanism in which the mTOR pathway plays an important role in control of death ligand\u2010induced apoptosis and TRAIL sensitivity. They discovered that TRAIL resistance in glioblastoma multiforme was a consequence of overexpression of the short isoform of the c\u2010FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIPs) and that FLIPs expression is translationally upregulated by activation of mTOR pathway in which both S6 kinase and eIF4E are activated and drives the association of the FLIPs mRNA with translating polyribosomal complexes. With the understanding of the linkage between death ligand\u2010induced apoptosis and translation control, Fan et al.51 attempted to resolve the intrinsic TRAIL resistance in certain cancer cells by testing the efficiency of 4EGI\u20101 and TRAIL, alone and combined, in human lung cancer cells. Fan et al.51 found that 4EGI\u20101 alone not only induced apoptosis of human lung cancer cells but also cooperated with TRAIL for enhanced apoptosis. As expected, 4EGI\u20101 as a single agent inhibited eIF4E/eIF4G complex formation, inhibited the cell growth, and induced apoptosis of human lung cancer cells. Moreover, the combination of 4EGI\u20101 and TRAIL was much more effective than either 4EGI\u20101 or TRAIL alone in terms of killing human lung cancer cells. The detailed mechanistic studies of Fan et al. suggested that the 4EGI\u20101 increased DR5 expression through a CHOP\u2010dependent mechanism (CHOP refers to a chemotherapy regime that consists of cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicinm, oncovin, and prednisolone) and reduced c\u2010FLIP levels through ubiquitin/proteasome\u2010mediated degradation, both of which are often involved in drug\u2010induced sensitization of TRAIL/death receptor\u2010induced apoptosis. Interestingly, neither knockdown of eIF4E with eIF4E siRNA nor rapamycin increased DR5 expression, reduced c\u2010FLIP or enhanced TRAIL\u2010induced apoptosis in the cancer cells they tested, suggesting that the 4EGI\u20101 modulation of DR5 and c\u2010FLIP and the enhancement of TRAIL\u2010induced apoptosis are independent of inhibition of cap\u2010dependent translation, thus suggesting that the biological activity of the compound is at least partially dependent on a significant \u201coff target\u201d mechanism.",

Molecular modeling of 4E1RCat binding to eIF4E suggests a potential mechanism by which 4E1RCat inhibits the interactions between eIF4E and either eIF4G or 4E\u2010BP1 by possibly binding to four shallow pockets of eIF4E which overlap with the eIF4G\u2010 and 4E\u2010BP1\u2010binding sites.

Since phosphorylation of the 4EBPs by mTOR releases 4EBPs from eIF4E and then eIF4E binds to eIF4G, 4EBP\u2010based peptides might bind eIF4E, and therefore prevent eIF4E from binding eIF4G. They synthesized a peptide containing residues 49\u201368 of 4EBP1, and fused the peptide to an analog of gonadotropin\u2010releasing hormone (GnRH), [DLys6]GnRH (Fig. 11). The utilization of the fusion of a 4EBP peptide to a GNRH agonist (GnRH\u20104EBP1\u2010WT) is mainly based on the following considerations: (1) GnRH\u2010R1 is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian cancers and other endocrine cancers, which is suited for a targeted strategy, (2) GnRH agonists possess the capability to facilitate cellular uptake of the 4EBP peptide since they are efficiently internalized by receptor\u2010mediated endocytosis, (3) the small size of GnRH agonists insures it will not interfere with the binding of the 4EBP peptide to eIF4E. They found that the peptide, [DLys6]GnRH\u20104EBP1\u2010WT, bound to eIF4E and inhibited cap\u2010dependent translation in multiple cell lines that express GnRH\u2010R1, while the GnRH agonist alone did not bind eIF4E. In addition, a fusion peptide that contains mutations of three critical residues for 4EBP binding did not inhibit cap\u2010dependent translation. Naora and co\u2010workers123, 125 found that [DLys6]GnRH\u20104EBP1\u2010WT peptide inhibited growth of GnRH\u2010positive cells in a dose\u2010dependent manner whereas no inhibition was observed in cells that lack GnRH\u2010R1 expression. More significantly, treatment of female nude mice bearing i.p. ovarian tumor xenografts with the fusion peptide suggested a \u223c30% reduced tumor burden compared to that with the [DLys6]GnRH truncated peptide alone or with saline. Although the author could not totally exclude the possibility that this 4EBP\u2010based peptide might inhibit growth in part by mechanisms unrelated to inhibiting eIF4E activity, their approach has resulted in a potent compound that is able to target eIF4E in epithelial ovarian cancer. Intriguingly, the approach of Naora and co\u2010workers should be generally applicable to the design of tissue\u2010specific agonists of eIF4E, by substitutions of the GnRN peptide agonist with other tissue\u2010specific targeting peptides.",
