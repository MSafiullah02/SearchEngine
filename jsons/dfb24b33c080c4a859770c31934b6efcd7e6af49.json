The copper content in unused portions of DOS copper packs was normal and free of bacterial contamination. Liver and blood copper levels in dead and sick sheep were not high. Sick sheep showed signs of hepatic encephalopathy and dead sheep were generally piled against fences and scrub. Deaths were associated with acute, severe, generalised, centrilobular, hepatocellular necrosis and live sheep had elevated circulating levels of liver enzymes consistent with liver damage. In recovered sheep there were no residual complications. It would appear that even at 0.5 mg/kg of DOS copper the safety threshold may sometimes be exceeded in some sheep.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "annex"}, {"text": "c o m p o u n d s such a s copper-methionate, a n d to a lesser extent copper calcium E D T A , p r o d u c e tissue reactions a t the injection site a n d result in variable a n d short-lived protection I n the treatment of copper deficiency, injectable c o p p e r preparations have a n a d v a n t a g e over orally administered copper, because they by-pass the inhibitory effects on copper of sulphur and molybdenum in the gut (Under.
