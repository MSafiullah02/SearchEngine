            "text": "China has become the world's largest foreign exchange reserve holder, having amassed almost US$ 2 trillion of international reserves by the end of 2008 (Fig. 1\n).1\nThe rapid accumulation of reserves has generated several controversies. One concern is whether this continuing balance of payments surplus signals the need for a substantial revaluation or appreciation of the Chinese Yuan (CNY) to protect China both from the inflationary consequences of the liquidity buildup and a misallocation of resources2\nas well as to help ease global economic imbalances. An alternative view, particularly associated with McKinnon and Schnabl, 2003a, McKinnon and Schnabl, 2003b, McKinnon and Schnabl, 2004, argues that a fixed exchange rate is an optimal policy for China and the larger Asian region both on the grounds of macroeconomic stability and rapid economic development. The global monetarist approach of McKinnon is based on the assumption of little or no sterilization of reserve accumulations, so that any payments imbalance is temporary. However, many other commentators have suggested that the Chinese government's concern with inflation has led the People's Bank of China (PBC) to heavily sterilize these reserve inflows.3\n",

(2004) famously argued that mainstream economists have failed to recognize that we are now in a new informal version of the Bretton Woods system (BW2) and the global economy is therefore not in genuine disequilibrium. While there are clearly important analogies between the current international monetary system and Bretton Woods (BW1), the question is still open as to whether we are currently closer to the early or late days of BW1.4\nIn the later days of BW1 much attention was given to the concept of countries as reserve sinks into which reserves flowed. Instead of stimulating adjustments, as assumed in global monetarist models, the reserves effectively disappear from the system (down the sink) and hence contributed to continuing disequilibrium. Germany was seen as the prototype of the reserves sink during the BW1 days. Today China appears to be playing that role. Thus investigating how China has reacted to its reserve increases is of international as well as national importance.5\n",

One of the reasons why there is so much disagreement is because, as Goodfriend and Prasad (2006) have noted, \u201c(t)he fraction of reserves sterilized by the central bank has varied over the last few years and it is not straightforward to assess exactly how much sterilization has taken place.\u201d",

However, this can offer a misleading picture of the effectiveness of sterilization. If the central bank wants the base to increase anyway, then it would decide not to neutralize the reserve increases; this would not imply that it had lost control of the domestic monetary process. China's large balance of payments surplus in 2003 was accompanied by rapid domestic money and credit expansion which is consistent with an inability to effectively sterilize. It appears, however, that the primary cause of the rapid expansion of money and credit was the Chinese government's concern with maintaining rapid economic growth, not the inability of the PBC to control the domestic monetary base.7\nThus, the PBC did not try to fully neutralize the domestic monetary effects of the reserve increases under government direction.",

This in turn requires the estimation of the counterfactual of the desired rate of monetary growth, i.e. estimation of the central bank's monetary reaction function. There is no one correct theoretical specification for central bank reaction function, but the literature has developed a standard set of variables to be considered within this function. This allows us \u2013 at least in principle \u2013 to breakdown the interrelationship between international reserve changes and the monetary base into those relating to autonomous changes in the monetary base (the offset coefficient) and those relating to autonomous changes in international reserve flows (the sterilization coefficient). We also make use of recursive estimation to investigate changes in offset coefficients and sterilization over time. While we find no evidence of the inability of the government to sterilize a high proportion of reserve accumulations, we do find substantial increases over time in our estimates of the offset coefficients, suggesting that sterilization is becoming increasingly difficult.",

It also briefly discusses the sterilization policy measures used in China (de jure sterilization). Section 3 offers a summary of the main empirical methodologies commonly used to estimate the de facto extent of sterilization. As will be discussed, the estimation procedure used in this paper is based on a set of simultaneous equations to estimate both the \u201csterilization coefficient\u201d (i.e. how much domestic money creation responds to a change in international reserves) and the \u201coffset coefficient\u201d (i.e. how much balance of payments changes in response to a change in domestic money creation). Since the foreign exchange and the domestic monetary markets are interrelated, ignoring such interrelationships can lead to biased results. Section 4 discusses the data and definitions of variables to be used in the empirics and presents the empirical results of the sterilization and offset coefficients based on monthly data for the period from June 2000 to September 2008. This section also discusses a number of robustness checks. The results remain remarkably stable to the alternative estimation techniques used as well as to different proxies for exchange-rate expectations and for valuation changes in international reserves. We also present a recursive estimation which suggests that while remaining substantial, the degree of sterilization has fallen in recent years. The final section concludes with a brief discussion of the macroeconomic policy implications and tradeoffs facing China in the future.",

Thus, reserves increased markedly during this period. An interesting dynamic appears to have taken hold in China (as well as in many other Asian economies) during this period. Large reserves are viewed as a sign that the domestic currency will eventually appreciate. They also tend to be taken as an indication of \u201cstrong fundamentals,\u201d hence leading to an upgrading of the country's credit ratings. This expectation of future capital gains and lower risk perceptions motivated large-scale capital inflows and added to the country's stock of reserves as central banks have mopped up excess US dollars.",

On the one hand, the decline in the capital account surplus was partly policy-induced. The government has been promoting outward investments by Chinese corporates and domestic institutional investors and has loosened a number of restrictions on capital outflows to ease some appreciation pressures from huge reserves accumulation, while simultaneously tightening some restrictions on capital inflows such as imposing a quota in July 2004 on offshore borrowing by foreign banks operating in China. On the other hand, the sharp increase in the country's current account balance is somewhat harder to rationalize.13\nIt has been suggested by some observers that the current account surplus has been partly driven by over-invoicing of exports and under-invoicing of imports. As noted by one market commentator:The massive flip-over between the financial account and trade account\u2026 in 2005\u2026raises the possibility that capital flow for\u2026(CNY)\u2026speculation masqueraded as a trade surplus last year due to improving capital account control. This is important in understanding the nature of China's BoP surplus. 2005 BoP data suggest that capital account flows accounted for one-third of the BoP surplus, while 2004 data suggest that this was three-quarters. If 2004 data are more accurate, the appreciating pressure appears to be mainly a speculative phenomenon (Xie, 2006).14\n",

If a shock from foreign assets (say an unexpected increase in foreign assets) is associated with an offsetting decrease in domestic money creation, it can be concluded that the sterilization is significant. An important limitation of the VAR approach is that it tends to treat all variables as symmetrically endogenous. As equations (2a), (2b) show, a standard form of the VAR model only yields the estimated values of lagged NDAs and NFAs due to the issue of identification. Consequently, the model cannot estimate the contemporary effect of variables without restrictions.",

In addition, a rising multiplier might be capturing an overall tightening credit policy, including a more restrictive policy towards capital inflows.22\nSecond, higher inflation perpetuates concerns about exchange-rate depreciation, interest rate hikes and capital losses thereof, hence causing a reduction of capital inflows.23\nThird, higher real output could worsen the current account (due to the income effect), reducing foreign reserve accumulation. However, this variable is a double-edged sword in the sense that a domestic boom could perpetuate capital inflows directly (i.e. pull factor).

The expected coefficient for each of these variables should therefore be negative. In addition, the monetary authority tends to adopt a countercyclical monetary policy to contract domestic money creation when there is a rise in real GDP growth rate above the trend (i.e. a domestic economic boom) or a more expansionary fiscal deficit, implying a negative expected coefficient again.26\nWe are least certain about the last variable as it is subject to a number of caveats. During an economic downturn there could be simultaneous use of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies and vice versa during an upturn in economic activity.

The recursive offset coefficient remained fairly stable between early 2005 and mid 2006 at around 0.55, dropped slightly to around 0.45 till late 2007, before rising very gradually since then to average around 0.5 over 2008. With regard to the recursive sterilization coefficients, while sterilization peaked in early 2005, it has been declining ever since, reaching around 0.7 by late 2007 and has remained stable ever since. This suggests sterilization has been quite heavy but not complete in recent years.

However, insofar as the de facto capital mobility is imperfect, sterilization can be effective. As China has been sterilizing capital inflows fairly aggressively. We estimate that the PBC has typically sterilized around 90 percent of the reserve inflows, which is similar to those obtained by Burdekin and Siklos (2005) and He et al. (2005). While Burdekin and Siklos (2005) suggest the PBC has over-sterilized the foreign reserves, they find the PBC has not done so sufficiently to prevent M2 (broader money supply) from increasing.38\nHe et al. (2005) find that the PBC has fully sterilized the capital inflows, and most of the responses finish in a month. Our rolling recursive estimates suggest that while sterilization in China was virtually complete until early 2007, it has been partial \u2013 but still high at around 0.7 \u2013 between late 2007 and late 2008.

Indeed, in recent years with the absence of sterilization, China's peg would have been a source of substantial inflationary pressure. Going forward, the Chinese authorities would do well to continue to relax the management of the exchange rate, in addition to taking further steps towards deregulation of capital outflows in a judicious manner. Less management of the exchange rate in turn should provide the PBC greater opportunities to use interest rate policy to manage domestic liquidity conditions and pressures.",
