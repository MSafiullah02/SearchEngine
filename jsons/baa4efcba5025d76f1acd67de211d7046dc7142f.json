To bill, there must be proper documentation and the patient must be informed. The physician may find it awkward to return an emergent call and inform the patient they will bill for the call. Patient requested non-urgent calls could be scheduled as a visit by the office, documented, and submitted for reimbursement.

Regulatory and billing issues were important, albeit secondary considerations. Using workflow diagrams (see Figure) to map the entire visit cycle in the practice helps to ensure a new service integrates well. By adding or changing only the parts of the workflow required to incorporate telemedicine, the new offering becomes seamlessly delivered in daily operations. We addressed one use case at a time, with plans to grow with each success facilitating adoption. Many practices may first start by looking for a mobile platform and then adapt their workflow to the technology. The authors advocate for the alternative approach of conceptualizing the desired future state first and then finding the right technology for the workflow. Some options are large platforms branded with the practice's name, while others are a simple link to join a visit. Technology is replaceable; however, a robust process to integrate that technology allows a program to thrive.",

Video visits can be converted to a telephone call if the video connection is unsuccessful. In addition, the team has found value in involving the provider when deciding if the patient can be scheduled for a VV, telephone call, or if they need to be seen emergently.

Using the same method to check visual acuity each time allows the provider to trend the measured vision, which becomes more useful data.

The authors recommend to check Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Academy of Ophthalmology resources for up-to-date billing changes, as the billing requirements are in a constant state of flux. Briefly, there are three main types of reimbursable visits 6 1. Telehealth visit -VVs with supporting documentation for established patients and, under the waiver, new patient visits. 2. Virtual Check-in -Telephone calls with supporting documentation. The phone encounter cannot be tied to an office visit within the last 7 days nor can it result in an in-office appointment within the next 24 hours or next available.",
