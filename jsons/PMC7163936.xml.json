Randomisation was to one of seven treatment regimens as described in \u2018Intervention.\u2019 A total of 18 subjects who had been randomised were excluded from viral challenge due to voluntary withdrawal or development of illness. Of the remaining 418 subjects challenged with virus, two withdrew prior to conclusion of the study and in 18 there was a viral antibody titre in serum or nasal\u2010lavage samples at day 0 greater than 1:4.

The New England Journal of Medicine commissioned an accompanying editorial\n1\n by a well\u2010known alternative medicine critic who suggested that the government funding agency of the study should \u2018consider halting its search for active remedies through clinical trials of treatments with low plausibility\u2019 to instead, \u2018study the mechanisms behind errant social\u2010medical trends such as the alternative medicine movement.\u2019 A more balanced and realistic commentary\n2\n came from a former director of the US NIH who stated, \u2018aficionados should take serious stock of the new study.

            "text": "Indeed, the study was conducted by a well\u2010regarded clinical research team highly experienced in assessment of rhinoviral infections. The experimental virus challenge methodology minimises the heterogeneity of recruiting subjects with self\u2010described \u2018colds\u2019 and the model has been used previously with success to evaluate antiviral drugs. Moreover, the 22 pages of supplemental appendix material provided by Bauer stands as one of the most comprehensive examples of phytochemical analyses in support of a clinical trial. Yet there are some legitimate concerns with the trial, particularly as related to the study agents. The three Echinacea angustifolia formulations used in the trial were the product of laboratory extraction and do not correspond to any of the proprietary Echinacea products available worldwide. None of the three preparations were comprehensive for optimal recovery of all four chemical classes of constituents reported to possess antiviral and/or immunostimulating activity. Commercial formulations tested previously in Europe were derived from the aerial parts of the plant instead of the roots, but the most appropriate portion of the plant for extraction is still up for debate.\n3\n Despite the outstanding attention to detail in the phytochemical analyses, no attempt was made to sample study subject serum to assess mean or peak plasma concentrations of purported active principles. Finally, the American Botanical Council\n4\n has pointed out that the Echinacea dose employed in the trial (300 mg root equivalent, three times daily) is less than one\u2010third of that recommended in the WHO monograph on Echinacea and the recently developed draft monographs on Echinacea from the Canadian Natural Health Products Directorate. In the defence of the investigators, however, the limited amount of governmental funding provided forces one to choose between testing multiple dose levels or multiple botanical formulations; it is likely that equal criticism would be levelled had the investigators produced negative results with multiple doses of just one formulation.",

For example, the same research team conducted a limited bioavailability study with the 60% ethanol extract described in the study, and the primary alkamide compounds, achieved a plasma concentration of only 10.88 ng/ml.\n7\n In fact, if the US funding agency is to be faulted, as it was in the New England Journal of Medicine editorial,\n1\n it could more appropriately be for not requiring adequate preclinical pharmacology and phase I pharmacokinetic studies prior to funding expensive clinical trials. Currently, a highly reputable US botanical manufacturer is funded by the same agency to produce a comprehensive Echinacea formulation, yet three other clinical trials of other Echinacea formulations are ongoing.",

University students at a mean age of 21 are likely to already be at the peak of immune function, but one could argue equally that the population is under a high degree of stress and may not necessarily follow optimal nutritional practices. Controversy also continues as to the most appropriate Echinacea species for such studies.\n3\n The authors used the most traditional plant for the current study, E. angustifolia, but most commercial Echinacea products are made from E. purpurea or E. pallida, as the latter are more amenable to commercial cultivation. A very recent report\n8\n from the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi suggests that melanins from Echinacea species may be potent immunomodulatory substances that are left behind by modern extraction processes, a reminder that the perceived advantages of traditional whole\u2010herb preparations may have a scientific basis.",

Hence, devotees of the herb are unlikely to be swayed by the current results.
