The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the predominant influenza viruses in Asia, Europe, America and Africa were A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B during the 2015-2016 season. 2 In East Asia, the predominant circulating virus was A(H1N1)pdm09 in the first half of the season, followed by influenza B virus in the second half of the season. 2 Although vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza infections, the current vaccination rates vary and are suboptimal in many countries (21-78% in the elderly). 3 Furthermore, considering the variable and moderate effectiveness of current vaccines, rapid development of efficacious vaccines with long-lasting and cross-protective immunity or broad-spectrum neutralizing antibody will be needed. 4", "cite_spans": [{"start": 374, "end": 375, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 851, "end": 852, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1015, "end": 1016, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1194, "end": 1195, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PANDEMIC AND SEASONAL INFLUENZA"}, {"text": "\u2022 Antiviral treatment (e.g. 75 China is currently experiencing the fifth.
