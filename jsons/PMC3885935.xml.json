These yeasts are now recognized as opportunistic pathogens that play a significant role in the development of different human and animal diseases such as otitis externa or seborrheic dermatitis. Malassezia yeasts have an affinity for lipids as substrates and the term \u201clipophilic yeasts\u201d has frequently been used to characterize the genus. In fact, 13 out of the 14 currently described Malassezia species show an absolute requirement for long fatty acid chains [2]. These \u201clipid-dependent\u201d yeasts are therefore seldom isolated in the laboratory unless specific nutrients are provided in the medium. The species M. pachydermatis is the only lipophilic yeast that may be isolated in regular media like Sabouraud dextrose agar.",

He described a series of 50 dogs with pruritic dermatitis from which the yeasts could be readily recovered by cytology or culture and which responded to antifungal therapy. Skin lesions consisted of erythema and hyperpigmentation that most often affected the ventral abdomen, although the face, feet and perineal regions were also commonly affected. A few years later, similar cases were described in dogs from Brazil and USA [4]. These reports forced the veterinary dermatology community to consider the potential role of M. pachydermatis as a cause of canine skin diseases [5]. Malassezia yeasts can also be isolated from the external ear canal and mucosae of healthy cats as well as cats with otitis externa and dermatitis. In healthy cats, reported percentages of isolation of Malassezia yeasts range from less than 10% to approximately 20% and up to 40% [1]. In parallel, the species M. pachydermatis has been identified in cats with otitis externa [5]. Lipid-dependent species, identified as M. furfur, M. globosa, M. sympodialis and M. slooffiae have also been reported from the skin or the external auditory canal of healthy cats or other felids [1,6]. In 2004, a novel species M. nana was described from otic discharges of a cat in Japan [7].",

A causal relationship between the overgrowth of Malassezia organisms and the development of seborrheic dermatitis was first proposed during the 1994 American College of Veterinary Dermatology meeting. The two cats had generalized exfoliative and greasy erythroderma, which responded to antifungal therapy. However, relapses were frequent and required repeated therapy. No predisposing disorders were identified and the histopathological changes were nonspecific. In cats, Malassezia overgrowth has since been associated with retroviral infections [8,9], paraneoplastic syndromes [10,11], thymoma [11,12], and diabetes mellitus [13,14]. In a retrospective study, Maudlin et al. evaluated the presence and importance of Malassezia yeasts in feline skin biopsy specimens submitted for histopathological examination between January 1999 and November 2000 [11]. Fifteen (2.7%) submissions contained Malassezia yeasts in the stratum corneum of the epidermis or follicular infundibulum. Eleven of the 15 cats presented with an acute onset of multifocal to generalized skin lesions. All 11 cats were sacrificed or died within 2 months of the onset of clinical signs. Based on these findings and the descriptions of the present study, Malassezia overgrowth should be considered as a marker of life-threatening, underlying diseases in cats.",

Atopic dermatitis has been described as a common predisposing factor for Malassezia dermatitis in dogs, whereas this association has been reported less frequently in cats [14,18]. In a series of 18 allergic cats with Malassezia spp. overgrowth [18], atopic dermatitis was diagnosed in 16 animals. All the cats were otherwise healthy and those tested (16 out of 18) were free from retroviral infections. The beneficial effects of azole antifungal therapy alone in five out of seven of these cats led the authors to conclude that Malassezia yeasts can exacerbate the clinical signs of allergy in cats as well as in dogs. Two out of six cases of the present report were associated with cutaneous food adverse reaction, and topical antifungal therapy was useful. In atopic animals, cutaneous lesions related to Malassezia overgrowth commonly occur on the face, ventral neck, abdomen and ear canals. The factors involved in the transition, from commensalism to parasitism, by Malassezia yeasts in cats are not fully understood.",

However, it may be proposed that such a diagnosis is appropriate when a cat with elevated numbers of Malassezia yeasts on lesional skin shows good clinical and mycological responses to antifungal therapy. Cytological examination is considered as the most useful technique for assessment of Malassezia density on the skin surface in animals. Several cytological criteria have been proposed to diagnose canine Malassezia dermatitis, including the observation of more than two yeasts per high power field in skin specimens. However, no report has been published that provided details of yeast density on the surface of normal feline skin and the use of threshold values is not recommended in cats. Contact-plate cultural techniques provide a rapid and convenient method for isolation of Malassezia yeasts from the skin surface. Because of the presence of lipid-dependent yeasts on the skin of cats, the use of lipid-supplemented media, especially the modified Dixon's medium, is required. However, in the present study, all the cases were attributed to M. pachydermatis and we may imagine that the use of regular media (not supplemented with lipids) would have been appropriate for the isolation of Malassezia yeasts. In cats, histopathological examination of skin biopsy specimens typically shows hyperkeratosis and irregular epidermal hyperplasia. As in dogs, Malassezia yeasts are not always visible in the epidermal stratum corneum, even in cases where large numbers are seen cytologically; this probably reflects disruption of this layer during processing.",
