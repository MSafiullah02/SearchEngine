Therefore, it can promote socio-economic inclusion and equality, quality of life and patient empowerment through greater transparency, and access to services and information. In addition, mHealth can facilitate other ways of delivering care, such as virtual consultations to replace in-person visits (i.e., telemedicine), which is a viable solution in several contexts, such as during disasters and pandemics (e.g., COVID-19).",

Moreover, there is evidence of successful implementations of mHealth in low-resource contexts, such as mobile-phone-based clinical guidance for rural health providers in developing countries [12]. This is possible because mHealth\u2019s dynamic infrastructure can easily overcome geographical barriers and environmental circumstances: currently there are places where people are more likely to have access to a smartphone than to clean water or electricity [13]. Furthermore, mHealth\u2019s demographic reach transcends generations, as demonstrated by various successful examples, including the promotion of physical activity and its acceptance by both young and older adults [14,15].",

In the near future, we expect eHealth and mHealth to become intrinsic to healthcare as a whole. For example, real-time monitoring devices can gather live data from sensors and send inputs into a mobile medical app on a smartphone, server, or network to support clinical decision making [7]. This new wave of big data powering personalized risk assessment tools will help patients and healthcare professionals make enhanced shared decisions. However, to avoid harm, it is critical that, among other concerns, the scientific accuracy, patient privacy, and user safety of mHealth applications are assured. Moreover, both lay and professional users should be aware that mHealth tools are designed to support and enhance, but will probably never fully replace, a direct consultation with a healthcare professional.",

(New York, New York, United States) announced a non-profit business partnership dedicated to improving their U.S. employees\u2019 wellbeing and healthcare satisfaction, while reducing overall costs [31]. Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, summed up their impetus to act: \u201cThe ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy\u201d [31]. These two initiatives are a clear statement that future healthcare will have a strong technological tonic. In the case of mHealth, it is expected that we will move beyond the current separate insulated platforms and single apps, and into a true health ecosystem [32]. We praise this change in paradigm in global healthcare and expect a parallel shift in urology.",

However, until there is a secure way to verify the authenticity of these claims, unscrupulous app developers could potentially exploit this by deceptive advertising or false endorsement (e.g., hiring a healthcare professional just to mention it, even though the app may not be related to their field of expertise). The lack of a standardized format for the disclosure of expert participation and the absence of readily available tools to verify and quantify it should be addressed. Alternatively, Apple and Google could require mHealth apps to be reviewed and/or approved by the European Medicines Agency, the United States of America Food and Drug Administration, or, if applicable, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulation. Moreover, urology societies could issue an official scientific seal or maintain a register of board-certified apps.",
