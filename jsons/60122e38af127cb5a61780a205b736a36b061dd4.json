The technical ability to undertaken virtual consultations, potentially reducing the need for clinician support staff, transport staff and costs have be available for almost a decade but only recently has work been started on exploring the use of technology [4] [5] [6] . Virtual clinics are rapidly being adopted in light of international locked downs. In response to the need to free up resources, sub specialities within medicine are being forced to radically re-think current practices. An example is The British Orthopaedic Association (BOA) [7] guidance advocating a more conservative approach to orthopaedic acute conditions. It recognises \"Surgeons will need to consider alternative ways to manage many aspects of urgent orthopaedic conditions and trauma. Changes to standard management plans may be required to minimise patient exposure to disease and overall impact on resources.\" Once the pandemic has passed, the same BOA guidance could be re-framed to address the urgent need to develop the practice of medicine in a more efficient manner that achieves the same or superior clinical outcomes at less cost. Furthermore, the quest over the last decade for those surgical procedures that promote early weight bearing, becomes even more pertinent [8] . Rehabilitation pathways are forced to swiftly evolve incorporating virtual reality and telecommunication platforms. Remote interdisciplinary communication and virtual clinical forums have received within weeks an impressive boost highlighting the inexplicable inertia of this readily available technology. The clarity of thought forcing changes in how medicine is practiced internationally at this time should be harnessed going forward.",
