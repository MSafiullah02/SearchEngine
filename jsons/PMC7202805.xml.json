Asthma may increase the risk of developing viral respiratory illnesses and even human rhinovirus (HRV), the most common cause of the common cold, is a potent trigger of asthma exacerbations.4 Synergism between allergen sensitization and viral infections in patients with allergic asthma, weaker anti-viral defenses, and lower interferon (IFN) production, all appear to contribute to the higher risk for viral infections in patients with asthma.4 Allergic sensitization and eosinophilic inflammation can breach the integrity of the airway epithelium, contributing to a milieu that may foster viral infections involving the lower airways and limit the ability of the respiratory tract to appropriately clear viruses. While the usual coronavirus infections are more likely confined to the upper airway, the predilection for COVID-19 to infect the lower airway, even in healthy individuals, creates even greater concern in patients with asthma.",

Given the current state of information, it is impossible to make conclusive statements about the effect corticosteroids might have on the disease course of any individual asthma patient. For instance, the timing of steroid administration during the course of HRV-induced illness significantly impacts suppression of cytokine production and inflammation.5 Indeed, current expert guidelines discourage the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of COVID-19 in patients in general.7 For patients with asthma who are maintained on ICS, both the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI) and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) recommend that patients continue to use their maintenance medications even during the pandemic.8 Continuation of therapy even with potential exposure to COVID-19 is extremely important since poorly controlled asthma is always the greatest risk factor for exacerbations with any viral infection.",

As many as 80% of asthma exacerbations are related to viral infections.4\n,\n5 Thus, these effects on overall exacerbations suggest that these biologics may impact virally-exacerbated disease. This effect has been best established for omalizumab, which prevents IgE from binding to its receptor on plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Cross-linking of IgE leads to lower type 1 interferon production, and in clinical studies, omalizumab has been shown to decrease the risk of, duration, and viral shedding of HRV in allergic children.9\n",

IL-4 is vital for antibody switching to IgE, and IL-13 is a Th2 cytokine involved in airway hyperresponsiveness and in airway remodeling, all of which are involved in susceptibility to and clearance of lower airway viral infections.4 Thus, it is likely that these biologics will lessen the risk of severe asthma exacerbations with COVID-19, at least by reducing baseline airway inflammation and possibly through specific antiviral properties.",

We do not believe any of the currently approved biologics for asthma treatment would increase the risk of disease or worse outcomes. On the contrary, we postulate that the reversal of the Th2 skew and the improvement in airway allergic and eosinophilic inflammation and bronchial responsiveness induced by these biologics, could be advantageous in patients with asthma who are already on these medications prior to contracting COVID-19.
