Evolution of pathogens within the lifetime of a host individual is implicated as a strong selective force in the evolution of sex and aging in the host. However, this assumption or its testable predictions have not been examined empirically. We classified infectious bacteria and viruses into those that can have continued longterm existence on the host body (group 1) versus those that have only a short-term interaction during an active infection (group 2). We surveyed the literature for age-specific incidence data about infections from both the groups. The age trends of the two groups show contrasting patterns. The incidence of infections by all group 1 pathogens showed a 2.28-to 28-fold increase in older ages. In group 2, 6 out of the 9 pathogens showed a significant declining trend in incidence with age. In both groups, there was greater mortality or morbidity among the infected in the old-age classes. These patterns are better explained by pathogen evolution than by age-related decline in immunity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "(0123456789().,-volV) (0123456789().,-volV)", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The incidence of a number of infections appears to increase in old age (Yoshikawa 2000; Schneider 1983; Gardner 1980; Yoshikawa and Norman 2017; Bender 2003; Meyers 1989) . There are three possible causes for this pattern. Although there is substantial literature on immunosenescence in several species of animals (Papp et al. 2012; Sidler et al. 2013; Youngman et al. 2011; Zerofsky et al. 2005) , the assertion that immunosenescence forms the foundation for infectious disease in elderly humans, according to Schneider (1983) , '\u2026lacks a firm scientific foundation'. Although over the last four decades, substantial literature on the molecular and cellular aspects of immunosenescence has been added, many fundamental questions about the evolution of these mechanisms, its relevance to aging and health, even a precise definition of immunosenes-cence are under substantial haze and debate (Fulop et al. 2018; Pawelec 2018 ). Alternatively, it is possible that a decline in the overall physiological capacity increases morbidity and mortality at the same level of infection. The third possible cause, largely overlooked by medicine, is that the opportunistic pathogens associated with the body evolve within the lifetime of an individual to overcome its resistance mechanisms. Evolutionary biologists have recognized this imbalance in the host-parasite co-evolution. Pathogens have an upper hand in the host-parasite co-evolution owing to their faster rate of evolution.

This normalization allowed comparison across pathogens with widely differing incidences. The significance of the trend in each of the individual datasets was tested using non-parametric correlations since the trends were typically nonlinear. Data on the same population but at different years were considered as different sets. If male/female incidence was reported separately, they were analysed separately. We avoided the childhood data (age \\20) in analysing trends so as to avoid complications due to childhood immunity. The consistency in the age trend was analysed using Spearman's Rho correlation using Excel 2007 and Prism 5. In addition to considering the significance of individual Rho at the significance level of 0.05, we also looked at how many datasets had positive or negative Rho values to test consistency in the trends across datasets. This was particularly important since in some datasets: only two age classes were recognized, and so individual Rho calculations were meaningless. For example, in opportunistic E. coli infections the data by Flasche et al. (2011) had only two age groups but there were 5 such datasets and all of them had an increasing trend. Therefore, although we could not test individual trends for significance, the consistency across datasets was tested to be non-random by a chi square test. At the third level, we also looked at the total number of negative and positive trends in group 1 versus group 2 pathogens. This analysis, being non-parametric, does not give a quantitative idea of the fold increase in incidence with age. The fold change in incidence in the pooled data was represented in age trend diagram (figure 1) and calculated as the ratio of the incidence per 100,000 in the age class over 60 s to the incidence in the age class covering the age 20.

In one, consisting of 10 species of pathogens and 14 pooled datasets, the incidence invariably increased with age. Between the age groups covering the 20s and over-60s, the increase was remarkable ranging from 2.28-fold to 28-fold. In the other pattern followed by 8 species and 12 pooled datasets, there was a significant negative trend in 6 with a 50% to 95% decrease in incidence between the 20 and over-60 age groups. The two patterns corresponded very closely with the two groups in table 1. All pathogens of group 1 showed a positive incidence trend with age. For two datasets, data on only two age groups relevant to our question was available.

For every group 1 pathogen, either individual positive trends or the consistency across trends was significant. Out of 58 datasets for group 2 pathogens, 46 trends were negative, 32 being individually significant. Out of the 12 positive trends, only 3 were individually significant.

However, evolution of any member of the microbiota within the lifetime of an individual has not yet been demonstrated. We give epidemiological evidence in support of within host lifetime evolution for the first time. A corollary of increased incidence of opportunistic infections is that evolving opportunistic pathogens contribute to the aging process itself both in physiological time and in evolutionary time, and many mechanisms involved in aging are triggered by opportunistic infections (Aguilera et al. 2018; Ulfat et al. 2017) . Thus, the cause-effect relationship might actually be inverted. It may not be old age causing infections but the evolving pathogens causing aging. It may not be a coincidence that after the use of antibiotics, which can disturb the course of evolution of the opportunistic pathogens, human life expectancy started increasing dramatically.
