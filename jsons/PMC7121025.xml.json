            "text": "Lychee (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) is one of the precious and economically important fruit crops of the world. The species belongs to the family Sapindaceae, which comprises about 2000 species of tropical and subtropical trees, shrubs and vines that have been classified into 140 genera (Chapman 1984). Lychee has been shown to possess variable diploid chromosome numbers where 2n = 28, 30, 32. The variation in chromosome number is thought to be because the modern species had more than one wild progenitor. Lychee cultivation was reported since 1500 BC by the people of Malayan descent and has been growing for thousands of years in southern Guangdong province of China. The first reference to this fruit is available in the literature of the Han dynasty (140 BC to 86 BC). It is sure that lychee is native of South China, but, according to Blume, Cochin-China and the Philippine islands are the lands of its origin (Popenoe 1920). It is also reported to have originated in China\u2019s Kwangtung and Fukien provinces and have been cultivated in China for about forty centuries (Ochse et al. 1961). A monograph written by Tsai Hsiang in 1059 AD is considered to be the first publication in the world devoted to this fruit. However, according to Walter T. Swingle, the first published work of fruit culture was written by a Chinese scholar in 1056 AD, on the varieties of lychee.",

Besides China and India, lychee fruit is also grown as a commercial crop in subtropical Asia, Hawaii, Israel, Mexico, Australia and South Africa (Jiang et al. 2001). India is the second largest producer of lychee after China with an annual production of 428,900 metric tons from 56,200 ha (Fig. 5.1). Lychee is mostly grown in Eastern India, and Bihar state alone contributes to 74% of Indian lychee production (Fig. 5.2). As lychee is an introduced fruit crop, it has great potential of yield in India. Figure 5.3 reveals a trend in the year-wise expansion in the area under lychee cultivation which has increased from 58,100 to 84,200 ha in 1991\u20131992 to 2013\u20132014 with a similar trend in the production from 355,900 MT to 585,300 MT in the last decades.\n\n\n",

It is covered by a pink or red leather-like pericarp due to the presence of anthocyanins (Lee and Wicker 1991; Rivera-Lo\u2019pez et al. 1999) as shown in Fig. 5.4. When distinguishing the cultivars, the shape of fruit skin segments and protuberances are reliable and stable genetic characteristics (Fig. 5.5). Fruit size, shape and taste are also variables but are influenced by other than genetic factors. Chinese researchers report that the shape of the skin segments and protuberances are more reliable characteristics than fruit size, shape or taste, to identify cultivars. The lychee cultivars vary greatly in vegetative flushing patterns, flush colour and flowering ability. The leaf of the Rose Scented is boat shaped, while China has a distinctive twist along the length curved upwards from the midrib and down along its length. Small leaflets in Bedana are oval shaped. The fruit shape of lychee is very distinguishing. The round shape of Bedana is distinguished from oblong shape of China or Shahi. The fruit is smooth and pulp is even or uneven. The apex of the fruit can be round, obtuse, blunt as in Shahi or pointed as in China (Fig. 5.5).\n\n",

Skin thickness depends on cultivars. Bedana and China have very thick skin, whereas Rose Scented and Shahi have thin skin. Skin surface at maturity also varies being smooth, swelling and sharp pointed. Protuberances of pericarp (skin) can be smooth as in Bedana or sharply pointed as in China.

The varieties can be identified by using tree characteristics. However, they change with weather, soil and culture. Differences in the tree size and shape, length and spread of branches are commonly seen.

There are usually two stages of male flowering overlapping with the female cycle: a true male flower first and then a functionally male flower that opens towards the end of the flowering period. The second male flower has a rudimentary bicarpellate pistil. This is absent in the first stage. Functionally, female flowers have 6\u201310 staminodes and a functional, bicarpellate pistil (Fig. 5.2). The last stage of male flowering generally supplies most of the pollen used to fertilize the female flowers. The ovary is bilobed, compressed and silky; usually only one lobe develops into a fruit. The stigma is bilobed. According to their hermaphrodite nature, flowers are classified into three classes, viz. type I, type II and type III. Type I and type III flowers are male, while type II flowers function as a fruit-bearing female. Most of the flowers are of type III and only 20 % of the flowers are of fruit producing type II females.",

The skin can be smooth or rough with distinct protuberances, thick or thin and pink red, bright red or purple red. The flesh or aril is an outgrowth of the outer cells of the seed coat (outer integument), and in good cultivars may comprise 80% of fruit weight. The aril is generally translucent white, juicy or firm and sweet and aromatic in better cultivars. Many cultivars can be distinguished by their flavour and aroma. The fruit contains a single dark brown seed 6\u201312 mm wide and 10\u201323 mm long. Some cultivars have a high proportion of aborted seeds and thus a high flesh recovery. They are popular in the marketplace, especially in Asia. There are a few cultivars that produce nearly seedless fruit, although the fruit usually weighs less than 10 g. The fruit shape of some cultivars is very distinctive. The round fruit of Kwai May Pink distinguishes it from the egg shape of Tai So or the heart shape of Haak Yip. The shoulders of the fruit can be smooth or flat as in Wai Chee and Kwai May Pink or uneven as in Souey Tung and Bengal. The apex or tip of the fruit can be round as in Kwai May Pink and Wai Chee, obtuse or blunt as in Souey Tung and Brewster or pointed as in Bengal.

In China, various other products such as pickles and wine are also made from lychee. The food value of lychee mainly lies in its sugar content which varies from variety to variety. Depending upon the variety and climate, the fruit contains 60% juice, 8% rag, 19% seed and 13% skin. Apart from proteins, fats, carbohydrates, minerals, fibrous matter, calcium, phosphorus, iron and carotene, the fruit is also rich in vitamin B1, riboflavin and vitamin C (Table 5.3). Lychee is also an excellent source of anti-oxidants which protects the body from harmful free radicals. Lychee flesh is loaded with nutritional and functional compounds. According to the data released by USDA, 100 g of lychee flesh contains 16.5 g sugars, 276 kilojoule energy, 0.83 g protein, 0.44 g fat, 0.44 g ash, 1.3 g edible fibre, 5 mg Ca, 0.31 mg Fe, 10 mg Mg, 31 mg P, 171 mg K, 1 mg Na, 0.07 mg Zn, 71.5 mg vitamin C, 0.011 mg thiamin, 0.065 mg riboflavin, 0.603 mg niacin, 0.1 mg vitamin B6, 14 mg folate, 0.07 mg vitamin E, 0.007 mg tryptophan, 0.041 mg lysine and 0.009 mg methionine. Taking 100 g lychee flesh satisfies 2\u20134% of the daily requirement for P, K, Mg, Fe, Zn and Mn and 22% for Cu (Wall 2006). Apart from nutritional value, lychee flesh improves digestion and blood circulation, moistens skin and alleviates symptom of anaemia (Chi et al. 2005). However, active compounds and mechanisms of these functions are unknown. Anti-oxidant activity of lychee flesh is well documented. In addition to vitamin C and E, lychee flesh contains anti-oxidant polysaccharides (Wu et al. 2004) and flavonoids including procyanidin A2 and leucocyanidin (Rooyen and Redelinghuys 1983). Polysaccharides in lychee flesh are effective to eradicate O2 and reported to significantly suppress lipid peroxidation in rat liver (Wu et al. 2004). However, based on Chinese traditional medicine, lychee flesh is a typical \u2018heating\u2019 food. Excessive taking causes \u2018heating symptoms\u2019 including sore and swell in the throat, boils in the mouth, tongue and face and tonsillitis. \u2018Heating effect\u2019 of lychee, which is only shown in some individuals, is not understood in terms of mechanism and effective compounds.\n",

However, the anti-oxidant activity of litchi skin is well defined (Guo et al. 2003a, b; Surinut et al. 2005). Lychee skin contains free-radical scavenging compounds like ascorbic acid, glutathione, carotenoids, polysaccharides (Huang and Wu 2006; Yang et al. 2006) as well as rich phenolic substances including flavonoids (flavonols and anthocyanins) and phenolic acids (Li and Jiang 2007). Zhang et al. (2000) found epicatechin, procyanidin B2, epigallocatechin and procyanidin B4 are among the major flavonoids in fruit skin of \u2018Huaizhi\u2019. Analysis conducted by Sarini-Manchado et al. (2000) showed that polymerized tannins (procyanidins) were the most abundant (0.4% fresh weight) in \u2018Guiwei\u2019 skin, followed by epicatechin (0.17%), procyanidin A2 (0.07%), anthocyanins (0.04%) and flavanols (0.04%). Two flavonoids in lychee skin especially anthocyanins and procyanidins contribute to the major part of its anti-oxidant activity (Luximon-Ramma et al. 2003). Zhao et al. (2006) found procyanidin B2 was stronger in scavenging hydroxyl free radical and superoxgen anion than procyanidin B4 and epicatechin, while epicatechin is more active in eradicating DPPH than the other two flavonoids.",

Results obtained by Wu et al. (1991), Zheng et al. (1998) and Pan et al. (1999) showed that the water extracts of lychee seeds reduced blood sugar in rat suffering from diabetes induced by ALX and that the effect was similar to that of the anti-diabetic drug, biguanides. And it was found that lychee seed extract was safer and the effect lasted longer (over 1 week) than biguanides (Zheng et al. 1998). Pan et al. (1999) suggested that lychee seed extract reduced blood sugar because it inhibited glucose uptake by blood capillary but promoted glucose uptake in ambient tissues. Guo et al. (2003a, b) also found that lychee seed extract alleviated sugar metabolism disorder and improved sensitivity to insulin in rat suffering from insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes (T2DM) induced by streptomycin and therefore reduced blood sugar. There is little information about active antidiabetes and lipid-reducing substances in lychee seed. Ning et al. (1996) attributed the abundant unsaturated fatty acids to blood lipid-reducing effect of lychee seed. Some authors suggested that \u03b1-methylenecyclopropylglycine in lychee seed was effective to reduce the blood sugar and glycogen in liver in mice treated with ALX (Huang 1994), while others believed antidiabetes activity was related to saponins (Guo et al. 2003a, b; Yang and Liang 2004).",

Xu et al.

Most authors attribute anti-virus effect of lychee seed extracts to its flavonoids (Luo et al. 2006; Liang et al. 2006; Gong et al. 2008), while Jiang et al.

            "text": "The lychee fruit is highly prized, especially in Asia, and is a valuable international commodity. It is, however, also very perishable. This limits marketing in many countries without good storage facilities. The perishable nature of lychee (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) poses a serious problem in its transportation and marketing also. Lychee is delicate, so minimal handling is preferred. Ideally, fruit should be shipped on the day of harvest. The fruit must also be marketed and consumed quickly. Research into the best handling practice for lychee is still in its infancy, and no accepted protocol exists. It is likely to begin with some form of antifungal treatment in the orchard prior to harvest. The harvested fruit would be initially placed in a coolroom to remove the field heat and then sorted on a roller conveyor in the packhouse. The optimum temperature for storage of lychee is approximately 5 \u00b0C (Huang and Wang 1990), although fruit stored at 10 \u00b0C can last almost as well (Olesen and Wiltshire 2000), with less risk of condensation in the pack. A modified atmosphere of 3\u20135% O2 and 3\u20135% CO2 was mentioned earlier, but other mixtures, and gases such as nitrous oxide (Qadir 2001), may also be used.",

            "text": "The shelf life of lychee at ambient temperature (26 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C) is less than 72 h. Postharvest losses of lychee are estimated to be 20\u201330% of the harvested fruit and could reach as high as 50% (Jiang et al. 2001). As fruits start deteriorating quickly upon plucking, they are graded, packed in boxes with green leaves as cushioning materials and immediately routed to wholesale and retail markets (Shi et al. 2001). Besides postharvest decay, pericarp browning is another problem limiting market value of lychee. Much work has been done on the roles of pigments, plant growth regulators and other factors responsible for pericarp browning (Zhang and Quantick 1997). Optimizing suitable temperature and chemicals to inhibit or delay pericarp browning during postharvest is necessary (Paull and Chen 1987, Jiang and Fu 1999). It has been reported that pericarp browning of harvested lychee is due to a rapid degradation of anthocyanidin by polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) (Akamine 1960; Chen and Wang 1989; Lee and Wicker 1991). Dehydration also contributes to pericarp browning (Scott et al. 1982; Underhill and Simons 1993) and leads to 40% decrease in water content after 48 h storage at 25 \u00b0C, 60% relative humidity (Underhill and Critchley 1994). Postharvest decay also occurs due to bacteria, yeast and fungi.",

Of these, only sulphur fumigation and fungicide dips have been used commercially (Jiang et al. 2003). Alternative procedures to sulphur dioxide (SO2) fumigation of lychee fruits have been proposed. These include team treatment (Kaiser et al. 1995) or hot benomyl dipping (Scott et al. 1982), but so far, no method has been widely accepted or established commercially (Lichtera et al. 2000). SO2-fumigated fruits absorb 30\u201365% of applied SO2. In recent years, there has been an increasing concern about sulphur residues in fruit, particularly when some consumers are sensitive to sulphites. A maximum residue limit of 10 ppm sulphur is set in Europe, Australia and Japan, while in the USA, sulphur is only registered for postharvest use on grape (Paull et al. 1995). Similarly, a range of fungicides has been evaluated for disease control in lychee fruit, including benomyl, thiabendazole, iprodione and prochloraz (Huang and Scott 1985; Scott et al. 1982; Wong et al. 1991). Among these fungicides, benomyl is known to have a strong and broad spectrum of fungicidal activities and has been shown to be effective for control of lychee fruit decay, but it is no longer registered as a postharvest chemical in many countries due to potential oncogenic risks (National Research Council 1987). Irradiation of fruit is considered to reduce browning and postharvest losses. Storage temperature of 2\u20135 \u00b0C is considered to extend the shelf life. Uses of perforated polythene bags (0.2% ventilation) and storage at 3 \u00b0C have also been reported to increase shelf life.\n",

However, lychee has so far proven to be a difficult material for propagation using in vitro culture. Attempts to regenerate plants from explants derived from mature trees have failed to give satisfactory results (Kantharajah et al. 1989). The biotechnological research on lychee, including tissue culture, anther culture, protoplast culture and lychee biopharming, are still in infancy but progressing (Table 5.7). Lychees are now widely grown in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. However, irregular and poor yields are commonly reported, and there is considerable scope for improving fruit quality and marketability through biotechnology (Menzel 1983; Galan Sa\u00faco and Menini 1989).\n",

Lychee postharvest research has been ongoing since the 1940s, and there has been a significant growth in the past 10 years. Most of the scientific papers relating to lychee have been published since 1985. Due to its increasing demand, the area under cultivation has increased manifold. But, there are several factors which have cumulatively hampered its production. These include irregular flowering and fruit-set, frost and wind damage, narrow cultivar base, poor growing techniques, high incidence of insect pests, short production season, variable yields, poor-quality fruit, short harvest season, lack of planting material and growing technology, high cost of planting material, lack of irrigation, lack of technical information for new growers, susceptibility of fruits to browning and rotting, short shelf life of fruits, inappropriate pruning, harvesting and postharvest management, high cost of fertilizers, inefficient marketing system and inadequate industry research and extension. The following suggestions can ensure a marked improvement in lychee production, storage and supply strategies.Lychee has a very narrow genetic base, which needs to be widened through selection of genotypes from the existing population. Target-oriented programmes must be launched so that germplasm is conserved and used. In this context of a network programme, \u2018operation lychee production\u2019 (OLP) should be initiated, and exchange of information and cultivars among countries should be encouraged. Starting of this network programme would boost lychee production and ensure livelihood security of the people.It should also be possible to apply in vitro mutation induction and selection procedures to address certain fungal diseases that affect specific lychee cultivars.Genetic transformation could possibly be utilized to develop the preferred \u2018chicken-tongue\u2019 seeds, using the pistillate gene from Arabidopsis thaliana, which directs seedlessness.Protoplast technology could be harnessed to produce somatic hybrids between haploids and diploids, so as to develop seedless triploids.Suitable cultivars are needed for various climatic conditions. It is also essential to develop promising lines/hybrids, which have larger fruit size, small/chicken-tongued seeds and tolerance to pericarp splitting.Suitable agro-techniques particularly for production and consumption management, postharvest technology and effective marketing need due attention.A systematic approach for the description of cultivars is needed. Thus, a lychee descriptor needs to be developed for herbaria and agriculture.There is need to develop propagation technology for faster multiplication of quality plants.The development of nutrition management to maintain tree health and encourage successful flowering and fruiting quality in sustainable manner requires attention.For efficient fertilizer use, monitoring through leaf analysis should be encouraged.Integrated management of nutrient and water with efficient monitoring mechanisms would improve both production quantity and quality.Through effective recycling of residues coupled with organic manure, it is possible to improve soil health. Thus, there is an immense potential for organic production of lychee through integrated pest management (IPM) to improve productivity and reduce the cost of production.The infrastructure for postharvest management requires input for timely marketing and to reduce the storage losses.\n",
