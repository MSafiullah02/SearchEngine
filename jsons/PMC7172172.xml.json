            "text": "Identification of the pathogen causing pneumonia is useful to guide antibiotic therapy, to help with differential diagnosis and for epidemiological reasons. Hence, most current guidelines recommend microbiological investigations in patients hospitalized for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [1], [2], [3]. Nevertheless the microorganism causing CAP is identified in only a minority of patients [4]. The difficulty in obtaining high-quality respiratory samples for microbiological analysis (e.g. sputum cultures) is an important limitation in the elderly [5]. Use of molecular biology technology improves the diagnostic yield in suspected pneumonia and is often prescribed by physicians, but it is unclear how it impacts clinical management [6]. Oosterheert et al. showed in a randomized controlled trial (107 individuals with lower respiratory tract infections, mean age 65 years) that PCR for viruses and atypical bacteria in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs (NPS) allowed the identification of additional pathogens but did not reduce antibiotic use or costs [7]. A pragmatic randomized controlled trial (720 individuals with acute respiratory illness, mean age 63 years) showed that molecular point-of-care testing for respiratory viruses did not reduce the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics [8]. Finally, in a prospective observational study (147 individuals with lower respiratory tract infection, mean age 78 years), PCR detection of respiratory viruses had no impact on antibiotic use and length of stay [9].",

Real-time PCR was performed on a Viia7 thermocycler (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA). The FTD Respiratory pathogens 21 panel (FTD-2, FastTrack Diagnostics, Esch-sur-Alzette, Switzerland) was used to target 17 viruses (coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1; human metapneumovirus; influenza A, A(H1N1) pdm2009 and B viruses; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3 and 4; respiratory syncytial viruses A and B; rhinovirus; adenovirus; bocavirus; enterovirus; parechovirus). The Bacterial pneumonia CAP (for community-acquired pneumonia, FTD-29.19, FastTrack Diagnostics) and the Bacterial pneumonia HAP (for hospital-acquired pneumonia, FTD-30, FastTrack Diagnostics) tests were used to detect nine bacterial species/genera: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results of the PCR for viruses were available to the treating physicians whereas the results of PCR for bacteria were performed subsequently as a batch on nucleic acid extraction, which were kept at \u201380\u00b0C and were not reported to the treating physicians.

Gadsby et al. achieved pathogen detection in 87% of patients hospitalized for CAP using comprehensive molecular testing [6]. This higher sensitivity is probably explained by collection of sputum in 96% of their patients, who were much younger (median age 67 years). In comparison, sputum of adequate quality was obtained in only 12/199 (6%) of our patients. Though sputum culture is recommended in international guidelines [3], [11], it is hard to obtain in elderly patients [12]. Our results compare with those of Putot et al., who were able to collect sputum from only 15% of elderly patients hospitalized for pneumonia [5]. Obtaining more good-quality lower respiratory tract samples would require an invasive procedure [13], [14].",

Positive and negative LRs were 1.50 and 0.85, respectively. This is in accordance with previous results in the literature. In another study assessing the performance of PCR on NPS for the prediction of CT-scan-confirmed pneumonia, prevalence of positive viral PCR was 28%, and positive and negative LRs were 1.39 and 0.87, respectively [15]. Certainly, many viruses, including influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus and rhinovirus, are known causes of pneumonia [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. Jain et al. showed that respiratory viruses were more frequently detected than bacteria in patients hospitalized for non-severe CAP (median age 57 years) [22]. But viruses are also detected in NPS in individuals with bronchitis, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and even in asymptomatic patients [23], [24], [25]. In the present study, many patients with non-respiratory sepsis or cardiac failure had positive NPS. Our results confirm that viruses are frequently identified in patients with symptoms of a respiratory illness, including those without pneumonia. Finally, antimicrobial therapy was stopped in only 10% of patients with a positive viral PCR, suggesting that comprehensive molecular testing might not be an adequate means of reducing antimicrobial therapy prescription in patients with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection.",

Compared with the results of the CAPiTA cohort, pharyngeal carriage rate of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae were lower in our cohort (14% versus 21% and 3% versus 17%, respectively), whereas the carriage rate was similar for Haemophilus influenzae (8% versus 7%) and higher for Moraxella catarrhalis (14% versus 8%) [26].
