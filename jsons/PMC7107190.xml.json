In an earlier study, we reproduced PES experimentally by inoculating 14-d-old turkey poults orally with intestinal contents from PES-affected birds. The inoculum was positive for rotavirus, turkey astrovirus (TAstV), and Salmonella. The inoculated poults developed diarrhea, depression, lethargy, and an average weight loss of 31.8% at 15 to 20 d postinoculation (Jindal et al., 2009b). In another study, we observed similar clinical signs and significant growth retardation in PES-inoculated poults even at 50 d postinoculation (N. Jindal, unpublished data). These results suggest that PES may adversely affect the growth rate of young turkeys, resulting in heavy economic losses to the turkey growers.",

Enteric viruses commonly associated with these diarrheic syndromes include rotavirus, TAstV, enterovirus, reovirus, adenovirus, and TCV (Barnes et al., 2000). Electron microscopy is the most commonly used method for detecting enteric viruses and is currently favored over molecular methods because it can potentially detect all enteric viruses in a single sample preparation, whereas several polymerase or reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) may be needed to detect all enteric viruses. The molecular techniques, on the other hand, are sensitive and specific and can detect very small quantities of viral nucleic acids. We suspect that the true role of enteric viruses in PES is underestimated because of the relative insensitivity of EM. We conducted this study to detect enteric viruses in PES cases by both EM and RT-PCR. The enteric viruses detected in these cases were characterized to determine genetic variations, if any.",

A case (flock) was diagnosed as PES on the basis of clinical findings of lethargy, depression, or diarrhea, or pathological changes of thin-walled intestines with watery contents. The intestinal contents of birds from a single case were pooled to make 1 pooled sample, which was further divided into 2 parts (parts I and II). Part I was tested for enteric viruses by EM (Goyal et al., 1987). A 10% suspension of part II of the pooled sample was made in PBS (pH 7.4). The suspension was homogenized and centrifuged at 784 \u00d7 g for 20 min. The supernatant was collected and tested for enteric viruses by RT-PCR as described below.",

Total RNA was also extracted from a known rotavirus, TAstV-2, reovirus, and TCV. Extracted RNA was subjected to RT-PCR individually using primers specific to each of the 4 enteric viruses. Primers for NSP4 gene of rotavirus (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2007), polymerase gene of TAstV (Koci et al., 2000a), S4 gene of reovirus (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008a), and N gene of TCV (Sellers et al., 2004) were used. The reaction conditions and reaction mix for the amplification of rotavirus, TAstV, and TCV have been described previously (Jindal et al., 2009b). For reovirus, the reaction mix consisted of 1\u00d7 RT-PCR reaction buffer, 320 \u00b5M of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 0.6 \u00b5M of each primer, 2 \u00b5L of enzyme blend, and 5 \u00b5L of extracted RNA for a total volume of 50 \u00b5L. Amplification steps consisted of reverse transcription at 50\u00b0C for 30 min, Taq activation at 94\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 53\u00b0C for 1 min, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and a step of final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Amplification was carried out using a OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). In positive cases, bands of 630, 802, 1,120, and 598 bp were observed on agarose gel electrophoresis for rotavirus, TAstV, reovirus, and TCV, respectively.",

Aligned nucleotide sequences were subjected to BLAST analysis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) to confirm their identity. The nucleotide sequences of each enteric virus were compared among themselves and with previously published sequences of that virus to determine differences at the nucleotide level, if any. The sequences were aligned by Clustal W method using MEGA 4.0 software (Tamura et al., 2007). The pairwise distance method using the maximum composite likelihood model was used for computing evolutionary distances. A phylogenetic tree of aligned sequences of each virus was then constructed by neighbor-joining method. The nucleotide sequences were translated to deduced amino acid sequences, which were also compared to determine differences at the amino acid level. The details of previously published sequences used for comparison are given in Table 1.",

The sequence homology with Ty-1 was 76.8 to 78.7%. When turkey rotaviruses were compared with previously published chicken rotaviruses, the sequence homology at the nucleotide level was only 66 to 69%. Amino acid sequences corresponding to positions 2 to 168 of NSP4 gene of Ty-3 (accession number AB065286) were analyzed to determine changes at the amino acid level and are shown in Table 3.

Similarly, the amino acids aspartic acid and asparagine at position 139 were observed in 26 and 11 rotaviruses, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequences of NSP4 gene revealed that turkey rotaviruses were in a clade separate than that of chicken rotaviruses (Ch-1 and CK/DE/SEP-810/05; Figure 1).

Six strains of rotaviruses from North Carolina (TK/NC/SEP-833/05, TK/NC/SEP-R642/05, TK/NC/SEP-832/05, TK/NC/SEP-R664/05, TK/NC/SEP-834/05, TK/NC/SEP-R404/05) and 1 strain from Wisconsin (TK/WI/SEP-844/05) used for comparison were in a separate group. Similarly, 1 of the 2 strains of rotavirus (Ty-1) from Japan was also in a separate group. The other strain from Japan (Ty-3) and 1 strain from Korea (AvRV-1) were phylogenetically close to rotaviruses in this study but belonged to separate groups (Figure 1)",

The sequence homology was low (80.6 to 83.1%) with reoviruses of chicken origin (CK/AR/SEP-854/06, strain 1733, strain 138, strain 176, and strain 1133).

The number of cases positive for enteric viruses was higher by RT-PCR than EM. In addition, reovirus was detected in 40% of cases by RT-PCR and not by EM. It is possible that some of the PES cases had lower virus concentrations that went undetected by EM thereby leading to classification of such cases as negative. It has been reported that SRV (TAstV, enterovirus, picorna like-virus) may not be clearly differentiated by EM because of similarity of their sizes (van Regenmortel et al., 2000) albeit with distinct morphologies (Caul and Appleton, 1982). This may be true in this study, too, because TAstV was not detected even from a single case by EM and the viruses resembling TAstV were classified as SRV by EM. However, when the samples were processed by RT-PCR, we could detect TAstV in 84% of cases. These results indicate the importance of using molecular techniques for detection of enteric viruses.",

Turkey coronavirus has also been identified in PEMS cases in the United States (Guy et al., 1997; Yu et al., 2000) and United Kingdom (Culver et al., 2006) and has also been detected in turkey poults affected with PEC in Brazil (Teixeira et al., 2007).

Pantin-Jackwood et al. (2008a) also detected combinations of astrovirus, rotavirus, and reovirus in chicken and turkey flocks. Woolcock and Shivaprasad (2008) reported the presence of multiple enteric viruses in cases of poult enteritis in turkeys. In an earlier study, we detected the combinations of 2 or 3 viruses from apparently healthy breeder turkeys (N. Jindal, unpublished data) with a notable difference that 81.4% cases were positive for 2 or 3 viruses in the current study, whereas only 40.6% of the enteric virus-positive samples from breeder turkeys were positive for combinations of viruses. The increased frequency of multiple viruses in PES cases as compared with those in apparently healthy flocks is not surprising. All 3 viruses (rotavirus, astrovirus, and reovirus) individually have been reported to cause diarrhea, depression, or stunted growth in turkeys and chickens (Hieronymus et al., 1983; Nersessian et al., 1986; Yason and Schat, 1986, 1987; Heggen-Peay et al., 2002; Otto et al., 2006; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008b). It is possible that these viruses in combination may cause more increased adverse effects in poults than an individual virus. Such a possibility under field conditions cannot be ruled out based on our observations of detecting these viruses in combination from PES cases. In experimental studies, we have reported that oral inoculation of poults with PES material (positive for rotavirus, TAstV-2, and Salmonella) led to significant growth retardation for up to 50 d postinoculation. At no point postinoculation did any of the challenged birds\u2019 weight converge with that of controls (N. Jindal, unpublished data). This extent of growth depression due to PES may lead to considerable economic losses to turkey growers.",

Close association of rotaviruses with previously published rotaviruses from the Upper Midwest indicated that turkey rotaviruses may assort based on geographic locations. Assortment of turkey rotaviruses based on different geographical locations in the United States has earlier been reported (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008a). Different groups of rotaviruses (groups A, D, F, and G) have been detected in poultry (McNulty et al., 1984), with group D rotaviruses being the most common (McNulty, 2003). We do not know to which group(s) the rotaviruses of this study belong. We also do not know whether the changes observed at amino acid level in rotaviruses of this study are group-related or not. Further studies are required to determine the groups of rotaviruses involved in PES cases. Assortment of turkey rotaviruses in a separate group from that of chicken rotaviruses based on NSP4 gene indicates that interspecies transmission of rotaviruses may not be a common phenomenon. However, Schumann et al. (2009) did report on the possibility of interspecies transmission and reassortment among group A avian rotaviruses.",

The TAstV have been detected from poults in the United States (Reynolds and Saif, 1986; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008a). The TAstV-2 has also been detected from PEMS cases (Koci et al., 2000b; Schultz-Cherry et al., 2000; Yu et al., 2000). In this study, we tested the intestinal contents from PES cases for the presence of TAstV-2 only. Hence, the presence of TAstV-1 in PES cases cannot be ruled out and needs further studies. Substantial changes were observed in polymerase gene of TAstV-2 both at nucleotide and amino acid levels. The effect of these changes on antigenicity or pathogenicity of TAstV is not known. The TAstV-2 assorted into 2 groups. In a previous study, the TAstV-2 also assorted into 2 groups based on polymerase phylogeny (N. Jindal, unpublished data). These findings have the support of Pantin-Jackwood et al. (2006), who also reported the assortment of TAstV from different regions of the United States into 2 groups on the basis of polymerase gene. It is not known whether these 2 groups of TAstV-2 belong to different serotypes or not, although it is possible that different serotypes of TAstV may exist (Strain et al., 2008). In this study, we used primers that could amplify a part of the polymerase gene of TAstV-2. To obtain even better understanding of TAstV, it would be interesting to study polymerase gene in full length from PES cases. Such a study would provide more information about the changes at a genetic level in this gene of TAstV.",

This study revealed the clustering of reoviruses on the basis of species. A similar assortment of reoviruses based on species has been reported by Pantin-Jackwood et al. (2008a). Due to a lower number of S4 gene sequences of avian reoviruses of turkey origin available in GenBank from different geographic locations, a few were used for comparison with reoviruses of this study. This study did not reveal a specific pattern of assortment based on geographical locations. A better picture may emerge when more sequences of this gene from different geographic locations are available in GenBank.",

We did not determine the correlation of enteric viruses with PES. We also did not test the intestinal contents for the presence of other enteric pathogens; their role in causing or increasing the severity of PES cannot be ruled out. Further studies are needed to determine the presence of other pathogens in PES cases and their possible role in the disease process. Based on our results, we cannot say whether rotavirus or astrovirus initiates the disease process; however, their prevalence in PES cases indicates that both viruses may do so on their own. It is also possible that these viruses may assume a more virulent role when birds are under stress due to concurrent infection(s) or climate changes. In this study, we did not analyze our data with age of birds involved; however, our previous study (Jindal et al., 2009a) suggests that young birds up to 3 wk of age are more susceptible to PES. The disease has been seen in poults as young as 2 d old. It remains to be seen how young poults of 1 to 2 d of age get exposed to these enteric viruses, even though fecal-oral transmission has been well established for these viruses.",
