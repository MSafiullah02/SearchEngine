Currently, pneumonia is the leading cause of death by infection [3]. Therapeutics available to treat respiratory infections are limited in scope and can have multiple adverse side effects and low efficacy [4, 5\u20136]. Respiratory infections initiate both innate and adaptive immune responses in the lung. Although these immune responses are critical for clearing respiratory pathogens, they must be tightly regulated to effectively kill invading microorganisms while minimizing bystander tissue injury and maintaining pulmonary function. In the present review, we discuss evidence that 2 classes of lipid mediators\u2014oxPLs and oxysterols\u2014are generated during infection and then mediate the pulmonary immune response. We also explain how pools of exogenous lipids (n\u20103 PUFAs) incorporated into host phospholipids can mitigate and improve the immunopathology associated with bacterial and viral pneumonia. Improved insight into these lipid mediators may ultimately provide novel therapeutic targets for the clinical management of pulmonary infection.",

The first line of defense that the lungs have against invading pathogens is the resident cells of the lung, both structural (i.e., respiratory epithelial cells) and hematopoietic (i.e., AMs) [8]. These cells, and the communications between them, are pivotal in orchestrating the pulmonary immune response to microorganisms. The epithelial cells of the respiratory tract create barriers mediated by their production of both secretory mediators and intercellular junctional proteins [9]. The secretory products of the upper and lower airways include mucin and pulmonary surfactant. During infection, mucin production is upregulated, in part through metaplasia of goblet cells, and serves to prevent microbes from binding to and infecting epithelial cells [10, 11]. Pulmonary surfactant, a complex mixture of \u223c90% lipid and 10% protein, serves both to decrease surface tension in the alveolus and to protect the respiratory tract from pathogens [12]. The hydrophobic SP\u2010A and SP\u2010D, are collectins, a protein family that recognizes a wide range of PAMPs, including those found on respiratory viruses, bacterial and fungal pathogens, and associated toxins [13, 14\u201315]. Once the SPs bind to pathogens, they promote opsonization and subsequent killing of the pathogens by phagocytic cells in the respiratory tract, such as AMs.",

Once PRRs on respiratory epithelial cells are stimulated by PAMPs and DAMPs, cytokine production is initiated by downstream signaling adapters, such as MyD88 and TRIF, that in turn activate key transcription factors, such as NF\u2010\u03baB and interferon regulatory factor\u20103 [9, 16]. The release of cytokines and chemokines recruits innate and adaptive immune cells to the lung from the periphery [9, 16]. During pulmonary infections, MyD88\u2010dependent downstream signaling leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20106, that act in concert with chemoattractants, such as CXCL1 and \u20102, to recruit PMNs to the lungs that kill pathogens [9, 16, 18]. The TRIF\u2010mediated pathway in the respiratory epithelium induces type I IFN production (i.e., IFN\u2010\u03b1 and \u2010\u03b2) [19] . Type I IFN signaling is critical to host defense, as revealed by mice lacking the receptor to type I IFN that succumb to infection by influenza virus [20]. Activation of type I IFNs produces several specific antiviral factors, such as IFN\u2010induced GTP\u2010binding protein MX dynamin\u2010like GTPase 1, as well as various cellular responses that are important in T cell recruitment and polarization [20, 21].",

Additional innate immune cells serve important roles in respiratory infections, such as mast cells, NK T cells, and innate lymphoid cells; however, in this review, we focus primarily on immune cell types with a defined response to lipid mediators.",

Macrophages and DCs are professional APCs that, in response to infection and insult, infiltrate tissues and initiate an inflammatory response. Macrophages are not only key players in the initiation of inflammation, but also orchestrate its resolution [25]. Macrophages can be broadly categorized into 2 subsets [39]. Classically activated or M1 macrophages are induced by the bacterial cell wall component LPS or a combination of the Th1 cytokines IFN\u2010\u03b3 and TNF\u2010\u03b1 [39]. Alternatively activated or M2 macrophages are induced by Th2 cytokines such as IL\u20104 and \u201013 [5]. M1 macrophages are characterized by the production of ROS, reactive nitrogen intermediates, IL\u20101, IL\u201012, and TNF\u2010\u03b1 [39, 40]. In addition, M1 macrophages drive Th1 responses, have roles in antitumor immunity, and kill intracellular foreign pathogens [41]. M2 macrophages express arginase\u20101, scavenger and mannose receptors, and IL\u201010. This macrophage subset regulates wound healing, restores tissue homeostasis, and also antagonizes proinflammatory M1 macrophage responses. Recent studies have shown that M1 phenotype is not static and that these macrophages can acquire anti\u2010inflammatory features with an M2 wound\u2010healing phenotype depending on the cytokine milieu to which they are exposed [42]. There is also evidence for subpopulations of M2 macrophages (M2a, M2b, and M2c) that are also characterized by differential expression of surface receptors and transcription factor expression as well as functional differences [43].",

The 2 main adaptive immune cell types required after pulmonary infection are T and B cells. T cell migration into the lung is thought to be driven by chemokine gradients produced by innate and adaptive immune cells [44]. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells program antibody production by B cells and are required for reduction of pathogen burden [45]. In murine models of influenza infection, viral clearance is not dependent upon CD4+ or CD8+ T cells individually; however, genetic deletion of both cell types completely abolishes viral clearance [46, 47]. Thus, these 2 T cell subsets work in concert to eliminate pathogens from the lungs.",

However, B cells are also important sources of cytokines and Ag presentation during respiratory infections [59].

As discussed above, surfactant contains approximately 80\u201390% PLs, with fatty acid chains that can be oxidized during different challenges in the lung [61, 62]. In addition, PLs are major constituents of cellular membranes and can be released during cell death and injury [63]. Oxidation of these PLs in the lung can occur during normal physiologic and metabolic processes but also in the setting of the increased oxidative stress of infection and inflammation [64]. Upon oxidation, PLs can be oxidized into a variety of species, including 1\u2010palmitoyl\u20102\u2010(5,6) epoxyisoprostane E2\u2010sn\u2010glycero\u20103\u2010phosphocholine (PEIPC), 1\u2010palmitoyl\u20102\u2010(5\u2010oxovaleroyl)\u2010sn\u2010glycero\u20103\u2010phosphocholine (POVPC), and smaller chemical fragments [65]. OxPLs are generated through either enzymatic or nonenzymatic reactions induced by ROS production, air pollution, cigarette smoke, and UV radiation [65, 66, 67\u201368]. OxPLs are thought to serve as DAMPs, insofar as they can stimulate multiple innate immune receptors, leading to prolonged inflammation and downstream signaling [64]. Once generated, oxPLs can be cleared by multiple biologic mechanisms, including enzymatic inactivation by epoxide hydrolases and aldehyde dehydrogenases, formation of adducts, or uptake through SRs or through neutralization by natural antibodies, C\u2010reactive protein, and complement factor H [69, 70, 71\u201372].

It is unclear what the primary source of increased oxPLs is during pulmonary infections; however, one could speculate that an increase in cellular apoptosis, an increase in ROS by phagocytic cells, and changes in surfactant from pulmonary inflammation are major contributors. In a pivotal paper Imai et al. [75] noted that oxPL levels are increased during H5N1 infection and that blocking oxPLs decreases the pulmonary inflammation associated with infection. They found oxPL\u2010mediated inflammation during infection to be a result of TLR4 activation of the TRIF pathway, indicating that oxPLs can serve as DAMPs that amplify the innate immune response during infection (\nFig. 1\n).",

Most of the cholesterol in the lung derives from uptake of circulating plasma lipoproteins [91], rendering the lung and its extracellular surfactant reservoir sensitive to diet and systemic metabolic states [92]. Cholesterol overload in the lung and, in particular, in pulmonary macrophages, is avoided through reverse cholesterol transport from tissue to plasma which, as in other tissues, involves interactions between cellular lipid efflux transporters (e.g., ATP binding cassette transporter G1 [93]) and plasma lipid acceptors (e.g., HDL). Intriguingly, increased numbers of lipid\u2010laden macrophage foam cells have been described in a wide range of chronic inflammatory lung diseases [94], suggesting that phagocyte cholesterol dysregulation may be a common, and potentially, a causal event in lung disorders. As a determinant of cell signaling and a molecular target of both chemical and enzymatic oxidation, cholesterol serves as a pivotal regulator of inflammation and host defense. The lung\u2010specific implications of this emerging role for cholesterol in inflammation and immunity, however, have only recently begun to be defined [95].",

Raft cholesterol is also critical to the viral life cycle in host cells, as several viruses, including influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus, and HIV are thought to bud from lipid raft microdomains (Fig. 1) [98]. Raft cholesterol also regulates the invasion of multiple bacterial pathogens into host cells. Further suggesting intrinsic and perhaps evolutionary connections between virus and cholesterol trafficking, the HDL receptor SR\u2010BI serves as a host cell receptor for HCV [99], and Niemann\u2010Pick C1, an endosomal cholesterol transporter, was recently identified as the cellular receptor for Ebola virus [100, 101].",

Viral infection induces downregulation of most of the enzymes in the mevalonic acid pathway in macrophages through an autocrine type I IFN loop, and this metabolic response is essential for successful host defense. Reports differ on whether host cell protection derives from shutdown of new cholesterol synthesis [103] or from depletion of cellular isoprenoids [102], an alternate lipid product of the mevalonic acid synthesis pathway. Depletion of newly synthesized cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum may potentiate activation of, and IFN induction by, the antiviral receptor stimulator of IFN genes, potentiating an antiviral feedforward loop (Fig. 1) [103]. Both statin treatment of wild\u2010type mice [102] and gene\u2010targeting of the mevalonic acid synthesis pathway in mutant mice [103] enhanced host defense against virus in vivo, including lung infections.

Analogous to the case for the double bonds of unsaturated acyl chains in surfactant PLs, direct oxidation of the carbon 5\u20106 double bond of the B ring of cholesterol by ROS is likely a common event for pulmonary surfactant cholesterol in the setting of inhaled oxidants such as ozone [105]. Ring oxidation yields cytotoxic oxysterols, such as \u03b2\u2010epoxide [105], the clearance of which is regulated by SRs [106]. On the other hand, several enzymes are known to add hydroxyl groups to the side chain carbons of cholesterol (i.e., carbons 20\u201327), yielding side chain oxysterols (e.g., 25HC) that have pleiotropic bioactivity [107]. Several such oxysterol\u2010synthetic enzymes appear to have particular relevance to phagocyte biology in the lung. For example, CYP27A1 is highly expressed in AMs of the human lung, and its product, cholestenoic acid, is thought to play a key role in cholesterol homeostasis in the human lung [108]. Ch25h, an enzyme that produces 25HC from cholesterol, is also most highly expressed in the lung in mice [107], likely because of its very high expression in AMs (http://www.immgen.org).",

PL homeostasis, cholesterol homeostasis, and n\u20103 PUFA metabolism are central examples of how lipids and their dynamic interaction with environmental factors in the lung influence the myriad of responses in innate and adaptive immunity. Connecting the mechanisms by which these lipid classes crosstalk to influence the targeting of receptors and downstream signaling in the lung will be centrally important in the development of new therapeutics for pulmonary disease. With the incidence of lung diseases on the rise, it is essential to understand how these mediators, singly and in combination, modify the pulmonary immune response and whether there are therapeutic opportunities for manipulating the levels of bioactive lipids in the lung during respiratory infection.",
