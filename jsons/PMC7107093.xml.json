On the other hand, some lines of birds have been shown to be more resistant to a variety of pathogens (Bearse et al., 1939; Hutt and Scholes, 1941). Several studies have demonstrated an association between the chicken MHC-B haplotype and resistance to various pathogens including Marek's disease virus, avian leukosis virus, Newcastle disease virus, Rous sarcoma virus, and Salmonella (Heinzelmann et al., 1981; Briles et al., 1982; Lamont, 1989; Dunnington et al., 1992; Yoo and Sheldon, 1992; Mays et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2008; Banat et al., 2013). Described in 1950 (Briles et al., 1950), at least 51 B haplotypes of the chicken B complex have been identified using traditional serological techniques (Briles and Briles, 1987; Landesman et al., 1993; Sung et al., 1993; Miller et al., 2004) or gene sequencing, RFLP, single-strand conformational polymorphism, and SNP (Juul-Madsen et al., 1993; Fulton et al., 2006; Juul-Madsen et al., 2006).",

More recently, infectivity studies identified B2, B5, and B8 chicken lines as being more resistant to IBV-induced illness than their B12 and B19 counterparts (Banat et al., 2013).

            "text": "Monocytes/macrophages not only play a vital role within the innate immune system, but they are also important in the activation of specific adaptive immune responses acting as antigen-presenting cells. As such, these cells can affect the progression of clinical disease. Innate cellular activity depends solely on the expression of recognition molecules, such as Toll-like receptors (TLR) that bind the conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns of common infectious organisms. The significance of the innate immune function of the macrophage in promoting disease resistance or susceptibility is not well understood. Macrophages are activated or primed upon encountering a pathogen or inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon (IFN) \u03b3 and subsequently undergo functional maturation, increasing expression of Fc-receptors on their cell surface (Dietert et al., 1991; Qureshi, 2003). Macrophages of various chicken lines congenic for MHC have been shown to differ in their chemotactic activity (Qureshi et al., 1988) and recruitment and activation (Qureshi et al., 1986). Like mammalian macrophages, avian macrophages produce nitric oxide (NO) upon activation, killing bacteria or protozoa and inhibiting viral replication (Boockvar et al., 1994; Kreil and Eibl, 1996; MacMicking et al., 1997). Expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) has been shown to differ among chickens of several genotypes, as a result of enhanced transcriptional activity in iNOS hyper-responder genotypes (Hussain and Qureshi, 1997, 1998).",

Posthatch, chicks were maintained in the incubator for 24 h, then transferred to a preheated brooder (35\u00b0C). In addition to daily health monitoring, fresh food and water were provided ad libitum. At 3 wk of age, room temperature was adjusted to and maintained at 25\u00b0C. Chicks were housed in standard poultry cages. To minimize the risk of pecking disorders, chicks were kept under restricted lighting conditions throughout the study. Experimental birds were euthanized by insufflation of isoflurane gas (Butler, Dublin, OH).",

All stimulations were performed on d 6 of culture when monocytes/macrophages from both B2 and B19 birds were mature (Figure 2). Nitric oxide production served as the indicator of macrophage activation. Timed exposure (24, 48, and 72 h) of macrophages cultured 6 d to either IFN\u03b3 or poly (I:C) demonstrated the existence of functional differences between B2/B2 and B19/B19 lines of birds aged 5 to 6 wk. Beginning at 24 h postexposure to IFN\u03b3 (Figure 4A\n) and poly (I:C) (Figure 4B), induced NO production by macrophages derived from B19/B19 birds was significantly (P < 0.01, t = test, paired) lower compared with that by B2/B2-derived macrophages. Additionally, the responsiveness of B2/B2 cells to either stimulant was significantly greater compared with that of unstimulated control B2/B2 cells (P < 0.01). At 48 h poststimulation with poly (I:C), there was a dramatic difference in the NO concentration of B2/B2 culture (92.76 \u03bcg/mL) supernatants than that of B19/B19 cells (17.90 \u03bcg/mL; Figure 5\n). Because background NO concentration, as well as cell death, increased at 72 h, especially in the B19 cultures, stimulation of cells in subsequent experiments with poly (I:C) (Figure 5A) or IFN\u03b3 (Figure 5B) was only characterized up to the 48 h time point using age-matched birds ages 6 to 12 wk. In addition, macrophages from B8/B8, B15/B15, and B21/21 haplotypes, as well as macrophages from B2/B2 on B19 background haplotypes (B19bgB2MHC), were stimulated with IFN\u03b3 (Table 3\n). Nitric oxide release from B19bgB2MHC macrophages was very similar (86.2 \u03bcg/mL) to that from B2/B2 haplotypes, and significantly different from NO release of B19/B19 macrophages (P < 0.01). However, stimulation of B8/B8 macrophages was very variable with repeated experiments (17.7 \u03bcg/mL). Although NO release was less than that of B2/B2 cells, B21/B21 (39.8 \u03bcg/mL) and B15/B15 (45.9 \u03bcg/mL) macrophages yielded higher levels of NO than B19/B19 cells.",

Several clinical studies in chickens, including an in vivo IBV infectivity study of B haplotype-defined chicks (Banat et al., 2013), have shown an association between disease susceptibility and the MHC (Briles et al., 1983; Taylor, 2004; Goto et al., 2009). Because differences in IBV resistance of B2/B2 chicks to clinical illness were observed early after initial infection, innate immunity was targeted in the current study. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which differences in activation of monocytes/macrophages of B haplotype-defined birds have been investigated in the context of disease resistance and susceptibility.",

The consistent, significantly greater response of the B2 macrophages could potentially explain the differences observed early after IBV infection. A role of TLR3, which binds to dsRNA, is implicated in the macrophage response and ultimately in in vivo resistance (Malmgaard et al., 2004; Whitmore et al., 2004; Kogut et al., 2005; Nang et al., 2011). Double-stranded RNA is a replication intermediate during infection with RNA viruses, such as IBV, avian influenza virus, and Newcastle disease virus (Malmgaard et al., 2004; Nang et al., 2011). Potential functional differences related to macrophage communication with adaptive immunity were evaluated through stimulation by the lymphocyte-derived cytokine, IFN\u03b3. The demonstrated significant differences in NO production that both poly (I:C) and IFN\u03b3 induced in the B2/B2 and the B19/B19 haplotypes may explain, at least in part, the greater resistance of birds of the homozygous B2 line to IBV-associated early onset clinical illness (Banat et al., 2013). As Dil and Qureshi (2002) showed, expression of iNOS varies among macrophages from chickens of different genetic lines and is associated with differential TLR4 expression in response to lipopolysaccharide. Further research is necessary to analyze iNOS and TLR expression on macrophages from B2 versus B19 haplotypes to investigate if similar pathways are responsible for the difference in activation.",

The congenic B2 on the B19 background demonstrated the B2 phenotype suggesting at least for B2 and B19, the genetic difference may lie within the B locus. Monocytes derived from additional homozygous MHC haplotypes were also differentially activated by IFN\u03b3. The cells purified from B15/B15 birds, which were shown by Bacon et al. (2004) to be more resistant to IBV infection also demonstrated greater macrophage stimulation.
