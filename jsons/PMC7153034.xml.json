However, the basic research on cardiovascular disease was still limited [1, 2]. In-depth basic research could provide a guiding direction for new methods in treating cardiovascular diseases [3]. Therefore, exploring the molecular and cellular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease could help us understand the disease process, discover new biomarkers, and find new therapeutic targets [4, 5]. Over the past decade, the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies given us an opportunity to expand our understanding of human transcriptomes [6, 7]. Previous studies have suggested that proteins are the main regulators of cardiovascular disease [8, 9]. However, with the understanding of the complexity human transcriptomes, it was revealed that most human genomes can transcribe RNA, of which more than 98% were untranslated proteins [10]. The number of non-coding RNAs was far exceeds the amount of mRNA encoding proteins [11, 12].",

So far, more and more studies have shown the important regulatory functions of ncRNAs in participate in biosynthetic steps such as transcription [16], RNA maturation [17], translation [18], protein degradation [19], and found ncRNAs play an important role in pathological processes such as tumors and cardiovascular diseases [20]. Based on their size, these non-coding RNAs were classified into microRNAs (miRNAs, <200 nucleotides), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs, >200 nucleotides), in which lncRNAs can also exhibit a circular shape called circular RNAs (circRNAs). In this section, we will illuminate the important role of non-coding RNAs in the development of cardiovascular diseases through their special biological function. The main classification of non-coding RNA and its formation in the cell is shown in Fig. 3.1.",

The precursor of the miRNA first existed in the nucleus. Then after the transcription and subsequently matured by several enzymatic reactions, mRNAs transferred to the cytoplasm to exert their biological functions. miRNAs exerted their regulatory functions by recruiting specific silencing proteins to form an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). It was speculated that about 60% of mRNA will be target by miRNA, while a miRNA may target more than 100 mRNAs in human. Specific miRNAs have significantly different expression levels in cardiac tissue and cardiovascular, and played as regulators of cardiovascular function, including cardiovascular cell differentiation, growth, proliferation and apoptosis, angiogenesis and cell contractility regulation. Meanwhile, the pathological changes in the cardiovascular system always accompanied with some specific miRNAs changes. These miRNAs changes have been confirmed to be associated with cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmia, cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, myocardial infarction and heart failure. Recent studies indicated that miRNAs with specific changes in the progression of heart valve disease play key role in the processes of disease progression, such as fibrosis, calcification, matrix degradation remodeling, and inflammation. In addition, some miRNAs could also regulate extracellular body through exosomes and participate in circulation in the exocrine [21\u201323]. Further studies revealed that these miRNAs can be used as biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases for clinical diagnosis and personalized medicine.",

To achieve this goal, they putted together all the datasets from other different laboratories. For the current version of circBase, it contained the simple search interface, various methods of data retrieval and unifying, merging and annotating published datasets. There were three main ways to search for the circRNAs in circBase, including the simple search, list search and table browser. Through these three methods, users could extend their information of circRNAs from this database. However, circBase doesn\u2019t support users to submit the new circRNA data by themselves right now.
