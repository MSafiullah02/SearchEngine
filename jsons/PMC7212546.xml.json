However, there are two zoonotic coronaviruses which are cited: The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which can especially affect the respiratory system through serious infections. In addition, the latter have the same characteristics: production factors, nosocomial transmission, replication in the lower respiratory tract and viral immunopathology. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV result from serious public health problems which ultimately lead to epidemics resulting in significant loss of life (Hui, 2017; Perlman, 2020; Hui & Zumla, 2019). When these two zoonotic coronaviruses infect pregnant women, they can lead to poor obstetric outcomes, including maternal morbidity and death. There is currently no specific vaccine or treatment approved for coronavirus infection (Hui & Zumla, 2019; Song et al., 2019).",

China immediately declared the epidemic to the World Health Organization (WHO) and also shared the sequence information with the international community after the discovery of the causative agent. WHO has done its part by coordinating the development of the diagnosis; issue guidelines for patient monitoring, sample collection and treatment; and provide up-to-date information on the epidemic (Munster et al., 2020). To date, the primary source of infection has been pneumonia patients infected with COVID-19. Transmission of respiratory droplets is the main route of transmission, which can also be transmitted by contact (G. O. of N. H. Committee & Office of State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 2020). The source of the virus and its ability to spread between people remains unknown, with an increasing number of cases showing signs of human-to-human transmission (Zhu, 2020; Chan et al., 2020).",

These interactions are generally spherical with a radius of 4 \u00c5 and cover most of the ligand. So, for the displacement of ligand in the binding site of our enzyme, the first level of interactions was considerate as the most important, the presence of Hydrogen bond interaction in selected complex explains that we have a good interaction between the three molecules and the studied protein (Table 4, Figure 3 and 4) (Adnan, 2019).",

Based on molecular docking, the results is very satisfactory, we have found three molecules among 67 which are very interesting either on the chemical side or on the biological side and therefore we propose these three molecules as inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The synthesis of the these molecules and the evaluation of their in vitro and in vivo activity against SARS-Cov-2 main protease could be interesting, before clinical essay.",
