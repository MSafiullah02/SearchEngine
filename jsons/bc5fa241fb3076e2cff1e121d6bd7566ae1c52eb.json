            "text": "Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) is a highly neurotropic virus that causes diffuse neuronal infection with neurological damage and high mortality. Virus-induced cytoskeletal dynamics are thought to be closely related to this type of nerve damage. Currently, the regulation pattern of the actin cytoskeleton and its molecular mechanism remain unclear when PHEV enters the host cells. Here, we demonstrate that entry of PHEV into N2a cells induces a biphasic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and a dynamic change in cofilin activity. Viral entry is affected by the disruption of actin kinetics or alteration of cofilin activity. PHEV binds to integrin \u24235\u24241 and then initiates the integrin \u24235\u24241-FAK signaling pathway, leading to virus-induced early cofilin phosphorylation and F-actin polymerization. Additionally, Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42), and downstream regulatory gene p21-activated protein kinases (PAKs) are recruited as downstream mediators of PHEV-induced dynamic changes of the cofilin activity pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrate that PHEV utilizes the integrin \u24235\u24241-FAK-Rac1/Cdc42-PAK-LIMK-cofilin pathway to cause an actin cytoskeletal rearrangement to promote its own invasion, providing theoretical support for the development of PHEV pathogenic mechanisms and new antiviral targets. IMPORTANCE PHEV, a member of the Coronaviridae family, is a typical neurotropic virus that primarily affects the nervous system of piglets to produce typical neurological symptoms. However, the mechanism of nerve damage caused by the virus has not been fully elucidated. Actin is an important component of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells and serves as the first obstacle to the entry of pathogens into host cells. Additionally, the morphological structure and function of nerve cells depend on the dynamic regulation of the actin skeleton. Therefore, exploring the mechanism of neuronal injury induced by PHEV from the perspective of the actin cytoskeleton not only helps elucidate the pathogenesis of PHEV but also provides a theoretical basis for the search for new antiviral targets. This is the first report to define a mechanistic link between alterations in signaling from cytoskeleton pathways and the mechanism of PHEV invading nerve cells.",

PHEV or inactivated PHEV was added to N2a cells at 4\u00b0C for 1 h to synchronize infection before the cells were transferred to 37\u00b0C to initiate infection, which is a method that has been widely used (23) . Compared with inactivated virus and mock groups, we found that PHEV entry into N2a cells induced the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia or stress fibers at different times. As early as 5 min postinfection (mpi), we observed the dissolution of actin stress fibers and the appearance of filopodia and lamellipodia. However, stress fibers reappeared at 30 mpi (Fig. 1A) . Simultaneously, we used ImageJ software to analyze the changes of actin semiquantitatively, which were consistent with the above-described results (Fig. 1B) . The dynamic changes in F-actin caused by virus infection next were quantitatively determined by flow cytometry. F-actin showed rapid polymerization early (5 mpi) and then started depolymerization at 20 mpi (Fig. 1C) . Actin cytoskeletal remodeling is crucial for PHEV invasion. Furthermore, we treated N2a cells with cytochalasin D (CytoD), which binds to and cleaves F-actin and binds at the ends of the filaments to impede the polymerization of actin at that site (23) . Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and indirect immunofluorescence were used to detect the entry of PHEV. We observed that CytoD strongly disrupted actin polymerization after treatment of cells by confocal microscopy assay (Fig. 2C) . Additionally, PHEV entry was impaired by the disruption of actin dynamics using CytoD and in a dose-dependent manner compared with entry in the control cells ( Fig. 2A to C) . Simultaneously, we also determined the growth kinetics of PHEV. Virus titer was significantly reduced after CytoD treatment (Fig. 2D) . The rela- Cells were pretreated with different concentrations of CytoD, and the internalization of PHEV was assessed using real-time PCR, Western blotting, and indirect immunofluorescence (see Materials and Methods). PHEV-infected cells were used as controls (Ctrl). DMSO, dimethylsulfoxide. (D) Growth analysis of PHEV. N2a cells were infected with PHEV after treatment with CytoD (1 g/ml), and samples were collected at the indicated time points. Titers are expressed as TCID 50 /0.1 ml. (E) Kinetics of PHEV entry into cells. Cells treated with PHEV were labeled with anti-S protein monoclonal antibody (red), FITC-phalloidin (green), and Hoechst (blue) at different time points. The figure shows the quantification of viral particle locations at different times. At least 30 cells from five representative fields were counted in each experiment. Scale bar, 10 m. (F) PHEV bound to N2a cells at 4\u00b0C for 1 h were transferred to 37\u00b0C; at the indicated times, bound viral particles that did not enter the cells were removed, and internalized viral RNA was extracted and assayed by real-time PCR. All results were considered statistically significant at a P value of \u03fd0.05. tionship between PHEV particles and actin early in infection was further examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy, with infected cells stained using FITC-phalloidin and PHEV particles labeled with PHEV-S antibody. During the first 10 mpi, the virus primarily concentrated in the protuberances, such as filopodia; as the infection progressed, the virus particles moved along the filopodia to penetrate the membrane surface of the cell membrane, moving and distributing in the cell membrane surface (at 30 mpi); at 60 mpi, PHEV particles had almost completely entered the cytoplasm (Fig. 2E ). Additionally, the kinetic curve of the virus entering the cell was determined by a fluorescence quantitative PCR method, as shown in Fig. 2F . The virus entry of the cell primarily occurred after 15 mpi. The results described above indicated that the entry of the virus is closely related to the dynamic changes of the cytoskeleton caused by the virus.",

The cellular actin cytoskeleton is regulated by cofilin, and the most important physiological function of cofilin is the cleavage and depolymerization of actin filaments to promote actin kinetics (4) . Cofilin cannot bind to actin when phosphorylated, and activity is reactivated by dephosphorylation. LIMK and testicular protein kinase phosphorylate cofilin, whereas sphincter and chronophin phosphatase dephosphorylate cofilin (20) . Because PHEV invasion of cells led to remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, we examined the changes in cofilin activity during the viral infection. Western blotting showed that cofilin was first inactivated and then gradually activated after 30 mpi (Fig. 3A) , which closely corresponded to the dynamic changes of F-actin, and a similar trend was also found by measuring the fluorescence intensity of cofilin (p-CFL) in the inactive state and its colocalization with F-actin (Fig. 3C ). PHEV infection also induced transient activation of LIMK kinase early at 5 mpi, which was then inactivated at 30 mpi (Fig. 3B) . Collectively, these results",

Notably, all three constructs inhibited PHEV entry in a dose-dependent manner, similar to the results of inhibition of cofilin expression (Fig. 5A) . Additionally, PHEV entry particles were assessed by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using an anti-PHEV-S antibody. Detection by confocal microscopy showed that the virus entry process was reduced (Fig. 5B) . Therefore, the dynamic phosphorylation of cofilin for the efficient entry of PHEV was essential. Cofilin may accumulate on cortical actin and participate in F-actin assembly and disassembly, which may affect viral binding and penetration. Additionally, cofilin-specific siRNAs could dilapidate cellular stress fibers, form small protrusions on the cell surface, and fragment actin filaments into lumps (Fig. 5C ). These results indicated that cofilin is required for PHEV entry into cells and the maintenance of actin cytoskeletal stability. Additional microscopic experiments showed that peripheral migration of the virus on cells mobilized cofilin, and the strict control of local activity around the cofilin cells is crucial for virus entry (18) . In the absence of PHEV stimulation, cofilin/WT expression and overexpression of mutant cofilin/S3A cells were positive for the cofilin rod-shaped structure. These rod-shaped structures were composed of active cofilin. Active cofilin can chelate actin, thereby reducing the production of wrinkles. These phenomena are consistent with increased cofilin activity (18) . However, PHEV infection caused the rod-shaped structures to disappear, indicating that viral infection modulated cofilin activity (Fig. 5D ). These observations suggested that alteration of cofilin activity favors viral adsorption and entry into cells.",

Cytoskeletal signaling molecules are usually mediated by G-protein-coupled receptors, lectins, and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in the regulation of cofilin activity. Additionally, several studies show that the virus binds to the cell surface receptor and induces an intracellular signaling cascade that is predominantly tyrosine phosphorylated. Therefore, we first examined whether RTKs were involved in virus entry and cofilin phosphorylation. When N2a cells were pretreated with genistein, a specific inhibitor of RTKs, viral entry and cofilin phosphorylation were not significantly affected ( Fig. 6A and B) . Therefore, RTKs were not involved in PHEV entry and cofilin phosphorylation. Integrins belong to the family of cell adhesion molecules and are a type of transmembrane protein widely found on the surface of animal and plant cell membranes. They are important regulatory factors in physiological activities such as cell migration and proliferation. Integrins consist of \u2423 and \u2424 subunits and exist as heterodimers on the cell surface (24) . Integrin \u24235\u24241 is a heterodimer composed of an \u24235 subunit and \u24241 subunit. Integrin is an important receptor of fibronectin (FN) in the matrix and primarily mediates the interaction of cells with extracellular matrix proteins and plays an important role in cell motility, migration, and neural cell remodeling (25, 26) . Therefore, we treated cells with the integrin \u24235\u24241 inhibitor ATN-161 to determine whether integrin \u24235\u24241 participated in PHEV entry into cells and cofilin phosphorylation. The results showed that viral entry and cofilin phosphorylation were significantly affected ( Fig. 6C and D) .",

The actin cytoskeleton is highly dynamic and is primarily manipulated by members of the Rho family of GTPases, which are activated by nucleotide exchange of bound GDP to GTP and can control signal transduction pathways that connect membrane receptors to the cytoskeleton (12) . Rho family small G proteins are key proteins that regulate cell morphology and motility migration. These proteins regulate cell motility and cell morphology by controlling actin contraction and microtubule distribution (29) . The three subfamilies RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 regulate cell shape and migration through coordination (30) . RhoA is responsible for the formation of stress fibers, Rac1 induces membrane ruffles or lamellipodia, and Cdc42 regulates the formation of protrusive filopodia (12) . The FAK pathway can regulate cofilin phosphorylation by activating either Rac1 or Cdc42 (1). To study the role of Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases early in the entry process of PHEV and PHEV-induced cofilin phosphorylation, we pretreated cells with Rac1 or Cdc42 GTPase inhibitors to determine whether they were upstream regulators of cofilin. Racl GTPase inhibitor EHoP-016 and Cdc42 GTPase inhibitor ML-141 both inhibited viral entry and affected cofilin phosphorylation during the early stages of PHEV infection (Fig. 9A to D). The small G proteins of the Rho family play a regulatory role by converting the GDP-bound inactive form to the GTP-bound activated form. To further examine the involvement of Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases in PHEV-induced cofilin phosphorylation, we tested the activity of Rac1 and Cdc42 in the early stages of PHEV infection. According to the PAK1 protein p21 binding domain (PBD) with GTP-Rac1 and GTP-Cdc42 interaction principle (31), we detected the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 by the glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown method. The PBD of PAK1 protein was constructed on a vector containing GST and expressed as a fusion protein (Fig. 9E) . Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) significantly activated intra- Cells were harvested and lysed after inhibitor treatment and virus inoculation for 20 min, and pulldown assays were performed as described above. All results were considered statistically significant at a P value of \u03fd0.05. cellular Rac1 and Cdc42, respectively (28, 32) . The cells were treated with PDGF and EGF to test the specificity of the established method. The results showed that GST-PBD interacted with intracellularly activated Rac1 and Cdc42 and that this interaction was highly specific compared with that of the control group (Fig. 9F ). The above-described method was used to detect the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42 at different time points after PHEV stimulation. As shown in Fig. 9G , Rac1 and Cdc42 were rapidly activated and slowly inactivated 20 min after viral infection, consistent with the dynamic changes of actins and the dynamic phosphorylation of cofilin. We also examined the effect of inhibitors of integrin \u24235\u24241 and FAK on Rac1 and Cdc42 activity. Rac1 and Cdc42 activities were detected after cells were treated with inhibitors and inoculated with PHEV for 10 min. As shown in Fig. 9H , both integrin \u24235\u24241 and FAK inhibitors affected Rac1 and Cdc42 activity induced by PHEV infection. The above-described results suggested that Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPases, as integrin \u24235\u24241-FAK downstream kinases, regulate cofilin phosphorylation during the early phase of PHEV infection. PAK1 is involved in cofilin phosphorylation as a downstream effector of Cdc42/ Rac1. PAK1 is a Rho GTPase kinase that is closely related to the regulation of the cytoskeleton, which is activated by Rac1 or Cdc42 and can phosphorylate LIMK (33) . We tested whether PAK1 was activated. In the early stages of virus infection, phosphorylation of PAK1 was obvious (Fig. 10A) , and its inhibitor, IPA-3, had a significant effect on viral entry and cofilin phosphorylation ( Fig. 10B and C) . IPA3 also inhibited the generation of filopodia and lamellipodia that were caused by PHEV infection (Fig. 10C) . Simultaneously, integrin \u24235\u24241, FAK, Rac GTPase, and Cdc42 GTPase inhibitors reduced virus-induced PAK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 10D) . Therefore, PAK1 acts as a downstream factor of the integrin \u24235\u24241-FAK-Rac1/Cdc42 pathway to regulate the formation of protrusive filopodia and induce membrane ruffles or lamellipodia in the early stage of PHEV infection. We then examined whether the pathway was activated in inactivated PHEV-inoculated cells. The results demonstrated that the pathway was not activated (Fig. 10E) , indicating that the pathway activation required PHEV invasion.",

Partly infected piglets have diarrhea symptoms (34) (35) (36) . Currently, no effective prevention or treatment measures exist for this disease (37) , which, when an outbreak occurs, causes enormous economic losses to the pig industry. Although the pathogenesis of PHEV and mechanisms of neural damage have been gradually characterized, very little research has been conducted on the pathways of virus entry into the cell. In this experiment, for the first time the cellular mechanism of PHEV cell entry was studied from the perspective of the actin cytoskeleton. The pattern is shown in Fig. 11 . We determined that cofilin is a key factor required for PHEV infection. PHEV entry required a two-stage process of rapid polymerization and depolymerization of actin, and PHEV triggered bidirectional regulation of cofilin protein activity. Viral binding induced phosphorylation of cofilin by integrin \u24235\u24241-FAK-Rac1/Cdc42-PAK-LIMK signaling for actin polymerization and efficient entry. Subsequent viral penetration activated cofilin, resulting in the fragmentation of existing actin filaments to promote viral trafficking. These findings suggested that PHEV promotes viral entry by regulating cofilin activity and inducing dynamic actin polymerization and depolymerization.",

Many viruses have developed mechanisms that allow them to exploit these structures to facilitate their replication (41) . Actin filaments are composed of a polymer formed by G-actin monomers, namely, F-actin, and are primarily located in the cortical region below the cell membrane (42) . Actin filaments play an important role in the maintenance of cell morphology and preventing the invasion of pathogens (11) . A virus binds to its corresponding receptor on the extracellular matrix (ECM), and then the virus must migrate to sites that favor its particular entry pattern, either by direct plasma membrane fusion or by macrophage generation, phagocytosis, and various forms of clathrin-mediated and clathrin-indepen- dent endocytosis (4) . During this process, viruses often encounter actin rearrangement processes, such as filopodia and microvilli, and use these structures to efficiently move to the cell membrane (4) . The rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton induced by different types of viruses is different. For example, murine leukemia virus (MLV) must bind to receptors via the action of actin to form a virus-receptor complex and move to a suitable location for the virus to complete endocytosis (43) . Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) requires the simultaneous polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments to complete its binding to host cells (44) . Poliovirus also utilizes the actin-and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways into the cell (45) . All of these results indicate that viruses utilize the complexity and diversity of host cell actin. In our previous research, PHEV entered neural cells primarily through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and for this process to be completed, an acidic environment with the participation of various proteins was required, including proteins such as mobilized proteins, cholesterol, and Eps15. Simultaneously, actin cytoskeleton integrity is positively correlated with virus endocytosis during PHEV invasion (22) , but the role and mechanism of the actin cytoskeleton in this process are not clear. In this study, we observed actin rearrangements with the formation of cellular filopodia and lamellipodia and the solubilization of actin stress fibers and their repositioning around the cell membrane in the early stages of PHEV infection. Additionally, the virus moves along the filopodia to the cell membrane. Cofilin is involved in neurodegenerative diseases as one of the actin filament regulatory factors (18) . Cofilin activity is also involved in virus-mediated actin remodeling (2) . In the early stages of PHEV infection, we also found that cofilin dynamic phosphorylation was the key to the virus effectively entering cells. The dynamic regulation of cofilin activity mediates the formation of cellular processes caused by viruses, and the critical control of local cofilin activity is crucial for actin-dependent processes such as receptor aggregation and intracellular migration.",

RTKs can convert extracellular signals into intracellular signals and regulate the structure of the actin cytoskeleton (46) . Integrins are heterodimers formed by the different pairings of 18 \u2423 and 8 \u2424 subunits. Integrins provide a link between the ECM protein and the actin cytoskeleton, which is critical for the regulation of the cytoskeleton and intracellular signaling pathways. Additionally, integrins participate in the process of virus entry into cells (47) . Most viruses affect the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton of host cells through RTK signaling pathways, such as transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and HSV-1 (47) . However, our results showed that PHEV affected actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and cofilin activity via the integrin \u24235\u24241-FAK signaling pathway. Integrin \u24235\u24241 not only accumulated at the PHEV attachment but also promoted the activation of FAK, which is a downstream kinase. Additionally, integrin \u24235\u24241 inhibitor ATN-161 blocked PHEV infection by inhibiting the downstream signaling cascade. Many viruses use integrins and related rafts to promote binding and internalization, consolidating the role of integrins in virus internalization and infection (3) and suggesting that internalization of integrins is a common mechanism by which a virus enters the cell. Notably, we also found another difference between PHEV and most other viruses in this experiment, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), Ebola virus (EBOV), and infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) (48) (49) (50) : the Src kinase did not participate in the process of virus-induced actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and did not affect cofilin activity. Src kinase is a member of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase family and participates in a variety of signal transduction pathways in the cell (50) . Under normal physiological conditions, FAK activates and then activates the Src family kinase under the action of integrin (51) . FAK was activated during PHEV entry into host cells, but Src phosphorylation levels did not change. Additionally, the process of PHEV entry into the cell was not affected after treatment with Src-specific inhibitors. These results demonstrated that PHEV regulates actin cytoskeleton rearrangements using the FAK signaling pathway independent of the Src family.",

In this study, we found that PHEV invasion of N2a cells was dependent on the roles of Rac1 and Cdc42. Additionally, we also demonstrated that Rac1 and Cdc42 were downstream Rho GTPases of the integrin \u24235 \u24241-FAK pathway, and both Rac1 and Cdc42 affected the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton by regulating the activity of cofilin through downstream PAK molecules. PAK is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase whose phosphorylation promotes the formation of actin filaments through the inactivation of cofilin; the dephosphorylation restores the interaction between cofilin molecules and actin monomers, which depolymerizes actin filaments. This regulatory process affects the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (6) . Although both Rac1 and Cdc42 regulated the actin cytoskeleton rearrangement through PAK, we found that the activation time of Rac1 and Cdc42 in PHEV invasion of N2a cells was different. In the stage of virus invasion, the activation of Cdc42 was earlier than that of Rac1. Whether different activation times of Rho GTPases indicate different roles requires further exploration.",
