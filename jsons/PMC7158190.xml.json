This current growth of research interest has been almost exclusively through studies using laboratory mice. To a great extent the work of Jeffrey Gordon, his colleagues and students at Washington University-St. Louis used the techniques created through the Human Genome Project to move the study of the host microbiome from classical bacteriological characterizations to the gene level (Gordon, 2012). This approach has permitted the study of noncultivable microbes. The Gordon laboratory used a variety of mammals, and even germfree zebrafish (Danio rerio) (Rawls et al., 2004), but the great part of their studies has been with gnotobiotic mice. The use of laboratory rats in gnotobiology has diminished significantly over the same time period and decades-old laboratories using and maintaining germfree rats have closed. This trend may reverse itself in the not too distant future, so a new section at the end of the chapter, titled \u201cResources,\u201d has been added to provide current information to researchers choosing to use gnotobiotic rats at some future point.",

F. Nuttall and H. Thierfelder working in Berlin, dates back to the late 19th century. These animals, maintained in the most rudimentary devices (Fig. 21.1\n), were first guinea pigs (Nuttall and Thierfelder, 1895, Nuttall and Thierfelder, 1896), then chickens (Nuttall and Thierfelder, 1895) (they had considered using the latter first but were concerned about reports of in ovo infections), and then other mammals by later investigators. Significant advances in the production, use, and characterization of germfree animals did not occur until the 1930s, and was virtually simultaneous at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana by James A. \u201cArt\u201d Reyniers and coworkers (Fig. 21.2\n) and by Bengt Gustafsson (Fig. 21.3\n), his professor, E. G\u00f6sta Glimstedt, and colleagues at the University of Lund, Sweden (later moving to the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm). These groups later reported the establishment of the first germfree rat colonies (see Gustafsson, 1948, Carter, 1971 for a review of the early work). Interest in gnotobiotic science and technology appeared later in Asia with the work of Masazumi Miyakawa (Fig. 21.4\n) and colleagues at Nagoya University, Japan.",

            "text": "The quantum jump in recent decades in the use of these animals was facilitated in large part by the introduction of the Trexler flexible plastic film isolator system in 1957 (Trexler and Reynold, 1957). This innovation greatly reduced costs while simultaneously increasing design flexibility. Prior to the late 1950s, germfree research was conducted in rigid isolators made of stainless steel or steel and glass (Fig. 21.5\n). The most commonly used type consisted of a stainless-steel cylinder bolted together and gasketed at the joints. Many of these systems contained a steam autoclave as a pass-through lock. These isolator systems were heavy, cumbersome, very costly, and occupied a large amount of floor space, since their weight prohibited placing them in tiers. The advent of the plastic isolator not only reduced the cost to one-tenth to one-fifteenth of the cost of steel isolator systems, but allowed units to be stacked in tiers of two and three in a multitude of sizes and configurations to conserve floor space (Fig. 21.6\n). This marked the birth of a new era permitting vast expansion in the production and availability of gnotobiotic animals. It also paved the way for the development of lightweight, disposable shipping units that made the transport of gnotobiotic animals to distant locations a practical reality.",

Pollard, director of LOBUND, personal communication, c. 1967). It was considered the most reasonable approach in attempting to assess possible threats to astronauts scheduled to land on the moon as well as to people on earth working with the specimens. It was only after the live animal and other tests proved negative for infectious agents that the moon specimens (popularly referred to as \u201cmoon rocks\u201d) were released to museums for view by the public. The germfree laboratory rat was chosen as the preferred test animal because it is not infected by any known infectious agent transmitted either horizontally or vertically (unlike the laboratory mouse, which carries a vertically transmitted leukemia virus). Rats from LOBUND were used because of the high confidence that the animals were of a pedigree known to be free of foreign agents, without accidental contamination, over a period of years.",

The ability to achieve this state may be limited by the inability to exclude endogenous viruses integrated within the host genome. At present, animals are accepted as axenic when they are free of bacteria, fungi, and metazoan organisms by routine sampling.

Another technique has been reported whereby the gut tract has been rendered sterile through the successive use of a variety of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Van der Waaij et al. (1971) reported that mice have been rendered GF within sterile isolator systems. The presumed advantages are the rapidity with which this regime can be accomplished as opposed to the traditional and proven method of cesarean derivation. For certain types of studies of short or medium duration, animals can be freed from viable microorganisms and maintained within an isolator utilizing gnotobiotic techniques.

In addition, standard surgical gloves are affixed to the wrists of the rubber sleeves to permit maximum tactile sensitivity. There is a 30.5- or 46-cm transfer port in the isolator for the introduction of supplies and instruments. An additional port is installed at one end, which is attached to a long tapered sleeve or a rigid clear plastic tube approximately 7.6 cm in diameter. This sleeve or tube terminates beneath the surface of a liquid germicide trap filled with a warm, 38\u00b0C, chlorine solution (a 0.525% solution of sodium hypochlorite, which can be prepared by a 1:9 dilution of classic bleach solution that most often comes as a 5.25% solution of sodium hypochlorite). A thermostatically controlled electric heating pad is placed between the exterior floor of the isolator and the rigid surface supporting the isolator. This provides warmth to the neonates after delivery. Within the sterile system, in addition to the required surgical instruments, sponges, and water, a plastic cage 35.5 cm long, 30.5 cm wide, and 14.5 cm deep is fitted with a taut Mylar membrane (a product of Dupont Co., East Orange, New Jersey), which provides a work area for the surgeons and which can be replaced after each procedure with a new membrane.

The surgical technician performs the hysterotomy through the Mylar membrane window in the isolator floor. This method is more tedious than the preferred and more rapidly performed hysterectomy. In addition to speed, the hysterectomy method permits an almost mass production routine, since the two stages can be performed simultaneously by separate surgical teams. One team is responsible for the extra isolator phase, which consists of preparation, euthanasia, hysterectomy, and introduction of the uterus into the sterile surgical isolator.

The surgical site is washed and disinfected. The abdomen is draped with a surgical drape containing an elliptical opening through which a midline incision is made. Good surgical technique is required to prevent the accidental incision of the intestines with its abundance of microorganisms. The uterus, with its cervix and cornuae clamped, is lifted from the abdomen onto sterile drapes. After severance from the maternal body, the uterus is lifted and removed to a 38\u00b0C primary germicide of 0.525% sodium hypochlorite solution where it remains for 5 s. It is then placed into a perforated container, which is lowered via the sleeve or rigid tube by a nylon cord from inside the sterile isolator to beneath the surface of a 5% iodide germicide. After an additional 15\u201330 s, the container still beneath the surface of the germicide is guided into the mouth of a 10.4-cm wide rigid clear plastic tube connected to the isolator wall. A surgical technician, with arms inside the isolator via the surgical sleeves and gloves, raises the uterus within the perforated container to the interior of the sterile isolator allowing the germicide to drain down to the germicidal trap. Two technicians on opposite sides of the isolator rapidly remove the fetuses from the uterus and separate them from their fetal membranes utilizing a taut Mylar membrane secured to a cage top as a surgical table. They are quickly washed with surgical sponges and rendered clean from amniotic fluid and blood. This is essential since a foster mother might cannibalize them if body fluids and remnants of the fetal membranes remain.

This method replaced the more cumbersome hand rearing and feeding (Gustafsson, 1948, Griffiths and Barrow, 1972), principally because of the more readily available lactating GF mothers and the increased survival rate as compared to hand-feeding methods. One would only consider hand rearing where minimal antigenic stimulation is desirable, and in these instances highly purified synthetic formulas are utilized.

The most pronounced anomaly of the GF state in rats, as well as other species, is the enlargement of the cecum that can lead to volvulus at the ileocecal\u2013colonic junction and eventual death (Wostmann and Bruckner-Kardoss, 1959). The content of the cecum and intestines are fluid, and the animal is said to have a chronic mild diarrhea. In addition, aside from low levels of antigenic material in the feed and bedding, the immune system of the GF rat is unstimulated (Gordon and Pesti, 1971). The lamina propria is thin and almost devoid of antibody-producing plasma cells, and lymph nodes are smaller (Gordon and Wostmann, 1960, Gordon et al., 1966). Also, due to the absence of its vitamin K synthesizing gut flora, the GF rat must have this vitamin added to its food, or it rapidly develops prolonged prothrombin times and hemorrhages (Gustafsson, 1959). GF rats are also much more susceptible to infections than their CV counterparts, which is why they may die soon after being introduced into a CV colony (Luckey, 1963). This can be prevented if they are first colonized by at least several members of their normal gut microbiome.",

They reported that soon after birth the entire gastrointestinal tract was populated by Lactobacillus spp. and a group N Streptococcus. During the second week of life, high concentrations of aerobic bacteria, such as enterococci and slow lactose-fermenting coliforms, were observed in the large intestine. Their numbers abruptly dropped during the third week of life when obligately anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides species, colonized this organ. Throughout the adult lives of mice, the obligately anaerobic bacteria remained at very high levels, and the aerobic component of the microbiome remained suppressed at very low levels. The microbiome of the rat has been found to closely resemble that of the mouse (Smith, 1965, Savage, 1969).",

This mix of microflora was able to drastically reduce the size of the cecum and therefore almost normalize the animals. Consequently, this flora, and variations of it, has been used extensively to colonize both GF mice and rats prior to their removal from an isolator into a new colony. A process for colonizing GF animals, commonly referred to as \u201cassociating animals,\u201d merely consists of colonizing an initial isolator of GF rats with pure cultures of each of the individual members of the flora. Additional associations are then achieved by simply introducing an associated animal into a GF isolator and placing fecal pellets from the associated animal into the water bottles of the GF animals on 2 consecutive days. During the first day the aerobic bacteria colonize the GF animals and lower the oxidation\u2013reduction potential, so that on the second day the extremely oxygen-sensitive fusiform-shaped anaerobes are able to colonize the animals. It should be noted that these few bacteria represent a very small fraction of the gut microbiome, and many additional members are necessary to normalize a GF animal completely (Syed et al., 1970).",

Historical data of the health status of the donor female provide excellent reference material should subsequent contaminations occur in the GF or SPF colony. Therefore prior to losing the identification of a cesarean-delivered litter, examination for Mycoplasma and intestinal parasites and serological examination for murine viruses are recommended. Certainly, at the very least, careful culturing of the ovaries and uterus for Mycoplasma should be performed (Ganaway et al., 1973, Schultz et al., 1974), since there have been occasional reports of Mycoplasma pulmonis isolation from GF rats, which may have resulted from in utero contamination of the dam (Kappel et al., 1969, Schultz et al., 1974). Careful workers discard neonates as a precaution if the donor female exhibits positive Mycoplasma in the reproductive system.",

Microbiological testing by fecal swabs of the neonates 24\u201348 h after delivery assures the asepsis of the surgical procedure as well as the sterility of the rearing isolator. Detailed methods are described elsewhere (Wostmann, 1970). The methods for gross observation and the detection of bacteria, fungi, and parasites are relatively simple and well standardized. The methods for the presence of exposure to murine viruses are usually accomplished through serological tests for the specific antibodies such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or the indirect immunofluorescence assay. Wagner (1959) worked out detailed sterility testing procedures, which are still utilized as standard procedures in many laboratories, albeit with updated analytics. Usually, when an isolator becomes contaminated with bacteria, the exhaust air loses its nonanimal-like almost sweet odor to the more familiar odor of laboratory rats. In nearly all instances, contaminants can be observed in fecal wet mounts prior to routine culturing. Culturing 24\u201348 h on appropriate media readily reveals typical contaminants at 37\u00b0C. Since 21, 37, and 55\u00b0C are standard incubation temperatures, molds and thermophilic organisms are also detected in the less common contaminations. Molecular methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative (q)PCR, may be utilized alongside culture-based methods to monitor isolator sterility (Nicklas et al., 2015; Fontaine et al., 2015; Packey et al., 2013). Because these methods utilize primers that recognize conserved regions of the 16S rRNA gene, they readily detect bacteria that are not easily cultured. When compared to bacterial culture, 16S qPCR is more specific and less sensitive (Fontaine et al., 2015).",

The confirmation of encephalitozoan in GF rabbits (Hunt et al., 1972) suggests the likelihood of such vertical transmission possibilities in rats and other species. With these limited reports as background, the examination of donor stock would be the only means currently available to help reduce the vertical transmission potential in newly derived colonies. Unfortunately, searching histologically for viruses is tedious and negative results would not be conclusive. With regard to encephalitozoan, immunofluorescent and India dye tests are fairly straightforward procedures and provide a high degree of accuracy (Wosu et al., 1977a, Wosu et al., 1977b). In summary, the previously referenced reports should be cautionary for investigators attempting gnotobiotic derivation of new strains or species. Established commercial breeders, using the most current testing methods for microbiological analysis, have long-standing pedigrees yielding a high degree of assurance in their gnotobiotic status.",

GF rats provide a uniform and relatively stable baseline of morphologic and physiologic activities, which, in turn, facilitate studies of superimposed changes. The earliest noted and most conspicuous effect of the GF status in rodents, including rats, is enlargement of the cecum. It becomes voluminous, usually five times larger than its CV counterpart on the same diet, and may approach 25% of body weight (Coates, 1973). This enlargement sometimes interferes with normal reproduction but can be significantly reduced with dietary manipulation of inorganic ions (Coates, 1973). The cecal wall is much thinner in GF rats and the cecal contents more liquid than in CV animals. This is due to an excess of water and anionic-soluble mucins, the latter being degraded in the CV rat (Asano, 1967, Pleasants, 1974, Carlstedt-Duke et al., 1986). Cecectomy of GF rats restores most functional and metabolic parameters within the CV range (Wostmann, 1975).",

If the GF rat's cecal contents are replaced with saline, then the water absorption capacity of the cecum becomes normal or greater than in CV rats (Gordon, 1974). GF rats have been reported to accumulate a compound or compounds in their cecum, which changes the tone and reactivity of mesenteric vascular smooth muscle to adrenaline (Baez and Gordon, 1971) and which is normally destroyed by the CV normal flora (Carlstedt-Duke et al., 1986).

The rate of mucosal sloughing is generally half that of CV controls (Gordon et al., 1966, Reddy and Wostmann, 1966), and digestive enzymes, such as proteases, lipase, and amylase, persist longer and farther down the gut under GF conditions (Lepkovsky et al., 1966; Reddy et al., 1969a, Norin et al., 1986). Urease appears to be absent under GF status (Delluva et al., 1968). The GF rat gut is more efficient in digestion and absorption, in part because the villi are longer and more even (Coates, 1973).",

In general, there is a higher need for total food and water, for vitamin K, the B vitamins, and for choline to prevent liver cirrhosis. GF rats maintained on a diet without supplemental vitamin K rapidly develop a hemorrhagic condition, while CV rats on the same diet do not (Coates, 1973). Antagonism between vitamins A and K occurs only when vitamin A intake is 10 times above normal (Wostmann and Knight, 1965, Reddy and Wostmann, 1966). On the other hand, GF rat nutrient requirements are less than CV requirements for vitamin A (Rogers et al., 1971, Coates, 1973), lysine, cysteine, and vitamin E to prevent liver necrosis, protein (Pleasants, 1974), calcium, and magnesium and zinc (Smith et al., 1973). GF rats given vitamin A-deficient diets survived much longer than CV rats (Coates, 1973). Assessment of the rat's nutritional requirements is often difficult because of coprophagy.",

            "text": "GF rat studies show unequivocally that the CV rat's microbial flora has a significant effect on the basal metabolism and on the response to adrenaline, cardiac output, and vascular distribution (Pleasants, 1974). The overall metabolic rate of GF rats has been reported to be one-fourth that of CV rats of the same strain (Wostmann et al., 1968). This undoubtedly results from reduced (one-third normal) cardiac output and oxygen consumption (Wostmann et al., 1968), reduced regional blood flow and distribution (Gordon et al., 1966), decreased heart weight (Gordon et al., 1966, Albrecht and Souhrada, 1971), decreased total blood volume (Bruckner, 1997), and decreased pulmonary partial pressure of carbon dioxide values (Schwartz, 1975). Aortas and portal veins of GF rats have an attenuated reactivity to angiotensin, vasopressin, and epinephrine (Altura et al., 1975). Production of short-chain fatty acids are related to microbial activity (H\u00e5verstad and Midtvedt, 1986) and reduction of total body fats has been reported (Reina-Guerra et al., 1969). In GF rats the lymph nodes and Peyer's patches are small, lack germinal zones, and contain few, if any, plasma cells (Miyakawa et al., 1969, Carter, 1971, Balish et al., 1972). Serum globulin values are one-third those of CV rats, and GF rats have less total serum proteins (Balish et al., 1972). The decreased immunological stimulation of GF animals leads to very low titers of agglutinating antibodies for Streptococcus fecalis, Proteus vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, Lactobacillus acidiphilus, and Bacillus fragilis (Balish et al., 1972). This is accompanied by decreased severity of conjunctival inflammation when infected by bacteria (McMaster et al., 1967). In relation to the foregoing, it has also been reported that the mucosa of the nasal cavity and middle ear have few lymphocytes and no inflammatory infiltrates (Giddens et al., 1971).",

They absorb saturated and unsaturated fats better, particularly palmitic and stearic acid (Demarne et al., 1973); have greater serum and liver cholesterol concentrations (Reina-Guerra et al., 1969); use more total fat in the diet (Nolen and Alexander, 1965); and have a higher cholesterol conversion rate (Reina-Guerra et al., 1969). A report on experimental cholesterol synthesis in GF and CV rats (Ukai et al., 1976) indicates that there is an inverse proportionality between the log phase rate of hepatic cholesterol synthesis and liver cholesterol levels in GF rats. Therefore the endogenous cholesterol synthesis in GF rats may not be responsible for the high cholesterol levels in plasma or in the liver. Liver cholesterol may play a major role in the regulation of hepatic cholesterogenesis in the GF rat by a mechanism similar to that in the CV rat.",

The bile turnover rates are higher (Reina-Guerra et al., 1969) as is the pH of the cecal contents (Thompson and Trexler, 1971). In GF cecal contents, the colloid osmotic pressures are approximately 100 mm Hg. This results in a pressure gradient of 60\u201370 mm Hg between the gut lumen and the blood plasma, in contrast to a smaller gradient in CV rats (Gordon, 1974). GF rats have greater reabsorption of bile acids from the gastrointestinal tract and therefore have greater recirculation of bile (Einarsson et al., 1973). Use of the GF rat in studies of cholesterol metabolism are particularly concerned with the factors that influence the absorption of cholesterol from the gut and its elimination from the body as bile acids via the feces (Wostmann, 1973, Wostmann, 1975). The GF rat appears to be unable to decrease the reabsorption of bile acids in the lower gut, a function of normal microbial flora. Work indicates that differences in the histochemical nature of mucosaccharides are dependent on whether they are located in areas of normal bacterial flora in CV rats or in areas relatively free of intestinal flora (Yamada and Ukai, 1976).",

The dietary requirements for microbiologically synthesized vitamins are higher (Coates, 1973, Wostmann, 1975), because the lack of normal microbial flora affects the absorption, which is greatly enhanced in the GF rat and which leads to the formation of urinary calculi unless dietary levels of calcium are reduced (Gustafsson and Norman, 1962, Smith et al., 1973).",

            "text": "Diets tend to vary according to the specific GF research objectives (Luckey, 1963), i.e., antigen-free diets for immune system studies or high sugar content diets in dental caries studies. Some diets have been found nutritionally adequate for short-term experiments even if autoclaved, as long as the diets are supplemented with filter-sterilized heat-labile vitamins (Oace, 1972). A canned, moist, presterilized (autoclaved) diet of known composition can be provided by spraying it into the isolator system (Foster and Pfau, 1963). Autoclavable diets are also available (Kellogg and Wostmann, 1969, Oace, 1972, Pleasants, 1974) as are chemically and water-soluble ones. The latter can be filter sterilized (Pleasants, 1974) and used as special purified diets for nutritional research (Wostmann and Kellogg, 1967). Growth of GF rats on these diets is comparable to that of CV animals. Reddy et al. (1969b) grew GF rats from birth to maturity using membrane-filtered, chemically defined, water-soluble diets based on amino acids and glucose. Diets sterilized by gamma irradiation have also been used in rearing GF rats (Paterson and Cook, 1971). Radiation sterilization using 60Co irradiation is recommended for studies of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in GF rats (Wostmann et al., 1975). Current diets suitable for studies in nutrition and metabolism of GF rats are listed in Wostmann's review (1975). However, besides the nutritional adequacy, moisture content of autoclavable diets must also be considered. The diet cannot be so hard that the animal is unable to feed normally, and if the diet is too soft, a rat's teeth will continue to grow and may need to be trimmed manually (Norin, 2018).",

M. pulmonis is the primary pathogen in chronic respiratory disease of CV rats (reviewed in Sugiyama and Bruckner, 1975) as demonstrated by researchers at the University of Alabama-Birmingham (Lindsey et al., 1971), but is now effectively controlled, if not eradicated from research animal stocks, through wide use of the cesarean derivation of breeding populations. Schoeb et al. (1985) and Schoeb and Lindsey (1987) also used GF rats to show that Sendai virus and rat coronavirus each exacerbates murine respiratory mycoplasmosis. Rats infected with M. pulmonis alone displayed mild disease, while those subsequently administered viruses developed advanced respiratory mycoplasmosis as well as more mycoplasmal colony-forming units in their respiratory tracts. Luckey (1968) provided an extensive bibliography on the effects of bacterial species on the monoassociated rat. Cassell and colleagues made effective use of monoassociated mice and rats to study the pathogenesis of Mycoplasma diseases and the host response (Cassell et al., 1974, Cassell and Davis, 1978). No differences were found in the susceptibility of GF rats to Plasmodium berghei primary infections via mosquito-borne sporozoites, nor were there any differences in the resulting pathology (Martin et al., 1966). Work in Balish's laboratory (Rogers and Balish, 1976) indicates that the GF rat can serve as an animal model of nephritis due to Candida infections, since the yeasts multiply in the monoassociated rats' kidneys.",

If cycasin is first hydrolyzed to the aglycone methylazoxymethanol, it is then carcinogenic to GF rats (Laqueur et al., 1967). Spontaneous colon adenomas are twice as prevalent in GF rats (Weisburger et al., 1975). No differences in the incidence of adenocarcinoma have been reported following intracolonic exposure to nitrosoguanadine carcinogens (Weisburger et al., 1975), whereas others report greater susceptibility of GF rats to these same direct-acting carcinogens (Shih et al., 1975). Results are significantly dependent on route of administration, since oral administration of N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanadine produced very few adenocarcinomas in GF rats as compared to CV animals (Miyakawa et al., 1975). It appears that there is a lower incidence of cancer induction in GF animals when the carcinogens being tested are of the type necessitating enzymatic metabolic activation.",

From work on the biological effects of radiation, it has been determined that GF rats survive larger doses of total-body X irradiation for a longer time (Reyniers et al., 1956). In basic immunological studies, GF or DF rats provide information on the role of the microbial flora in stimulating humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Immunity, as measured by opsonic activity, is depressed in GF rats infected with P. aeruginosa, whereas the GF rat's responsiveness to H and O antigens of Escherichia coli and to sheep erythrocytes is increased (McClellan et al., 1974). Differences in phagocytosis depend on differences in opsonic activity rather than on functional differences at the cellular level. In vitro studies with 32P-labeled E. coli opsonized with sera of GF rats indicated that cells from GF rats were slightly more active in ingesting capacity than cells from CV rats. Thus the opsonic activity of CV rat sera is higher than that of GF rat sera when tested in vitro (Trippestad and Midvedt, 1971). GF rats have been reported to reject skin allografts more rapidly than CV rats (Lev, 1963; McDonald et al., 1971; Carter and Bazin, 1980), whereas autografts of skin transplants on rat tails heal quickly (Ashman, 1975). The latter is postulated to be due to genetic uniformity of histocompatibility factors in GF animals (Ashman, 1975). The GF allogenic radiation-induced chimera has a greatly reduced or absent T-cell response, whereas the B-cell response is almost normal (Bealmear et al., 1973).",

Toward the end of the 20th century, several potential mouse models were investigated (Elson et al., 1995) but none appears to show the overall promise of a transgenic rat model (Sartor, 2000) that has allowed critical evaluation of the host response and the host's associated intestinal flora in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal disease. The breakthrough was provided by the successful introduction of a human gene into Fischer rats creating a transgenic rat line that reproduced and was cesarean derived into the GF state by Balish (Taurog et al., 1994, Warner et al., 1996). Sartor and coworkers then used this transgenic line to show that spontaneous colitis did not develop in the GF host but did develop in both CV and monoassociated rats (Rath et al., 1996, Rath et al., 1999, Rath et al., 2001, Dieleman et al., 2003). The possibility still exists that many intestinal disturbances could result from the lack of functionally active microbes. Current ongoing studies of the mammalian microbiome have begun to focus thinking on this possibility instead of the presence of disease-causing microorganisms.",

The early pioneers were convinced that the security of GF systems could be best achieved when rigid components were used that could withstand impact and be less vulnerable to breakage. Stainless-steel cylinder-shaped GF isolators bolted and gasketed together were the most commonly used system in the United States at the LOBUND Laboratory, the National Institutes of Health, and Walter Reed Army Institute for Research. In Sweden, at the Karolinska Institutet, Gustafsson (1948) developed rectangular rigid steel isolators with glass tops maximizing the visibility inside. These units could be totally introduced into a steam autoclave for sterilization. In both the Reyniers cylindrical tank and the Gustafsson isolator, neoprene sleeves and gloves were used for manipulation constituting a potential weakness, since they were subject to tear or puncture. Miyakawa (1968) in Japan operated remote mechanical arms and hands from outside a small sterile room similar to the equipment sometimes seen in radiation research laboratories. Even though there are very fine research reports from this period, the cost of equipment and its inefficient utilization of space limited the number of workers in the field. Also, the complexity of the fabrication and construction added further to discourage interested scientists. It was not until Trexler developed the low-cost, lightweight, flexible film isolator that GF research came within the budgetary and technical reach of the research community in general. In 1957, a standard flexible film 1.5 \u00d7 0.6 \u00d7 0.6 m isolator complete with filtration, transfer port, exhaust trap, and flexible sleeves and gloves bore a price of $300\u2013$400 compared to $5000 for a typical stainless-steel tank-type isolator. Thus technological advances produced a system that has proved to be equally or more secure, light in weight to permit use in tiers, and made of clear plastic to allow complete visibility. An extension of the flexible film technology brought forth a lightweight, disposable, flexible film shipping unit (Trexler and Reynold, 1957) weighing 5\u20136 kg compared to earlier units weighing 70\u201380 kg and which required a battery-operated blower system. Thus both rearing and research units, plus shipping units, were readily obtainable to those interested in using and transporting GF and GN animals.",

The CV animal usually is not reared in a barrier environment where all materials contacting the animals have undergone decontamination, pasteurization, or sterilization. The probability therefore is far greater that microbiological variability does occur in CV animals because of their more loosely controlled environment.",

What is the value of highly sophisticated instrumentation designed to make finite measurements of biological materials if the biological tool is uncontrolled and undefinable? The horizons of gnotobiotic research applications have expanded to include space travel and its potential and unpredictable effects on humans and their biosphere. Other areas of research include oral pathology, cancer, wound repair, infectious diseases, and nutrition. The GF animal therefore offers a multitude of research opportunities.",
