Skin damage caused by enhanced infection-prevention measures among health care workers, which could reduce their enthusiasm for overloaded work and make them anxious, has been reported frequently.",

Among a series of symptoms and signs, dryness/tightness and desquamation were the most common symptom (70.3%) and sign (62.2%), respectively ( Table I) . The health care workers who wore some medical devices more than 6 hours had higher risks of skin damage in corresponding sites than those who did for less time (N95 masks: odds ratio [OR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-3.01; P \\.01); goggles: OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.41-3.83, P \\ .01), whereas a longer time of wearing a face shield was not a significant risk factor in causing forehead skin damage (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.93-2.50; P \u00bc .66). The more frequent ([10 times daily) hand hygiene could increase the risk of hand skin damage (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.38-3.43; P \\.01), rather than a longer time of wearing gloves (Table II) .",

Besides, prophylactic dressings could be considered to alleviate the device-related pressure injuries, according to a prior study. 5 We would like to thank Xiaoxu Yin from Tongji Medical College School of Public Health for his suggestions about this paper and the health care workers who participated in our study for their support of this paper.
