(Siddell, 1995, Zeng et al., 2004). Because phosphorylation is known to play critical roles in the function of proteins, the nature of the phosphorylation of N was compared in the cell at varying times p.i. and in the supernatant virion. At 8 h p.i., and 16 h p.i., 32P-orthophosphate (32Pi)-labeled IBV N protein was purified by immunoprecipitation of infected Vero cell lysates and from supernatant viral particles, respectively, using rabbit anti-N polyclonal antibody. The N protein from both the intracellular lysates and virions were found to be phosphorylated (Fig. 1A). Two phosphorylated forms of the cell lysate N were detected, as distinguished by electrophoretic mobilities (Fig. 1A). Using Western blot analysis, both bands reacted with chicken anti-IBV polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1B) or rabbit anti-N polyclonal antibody (not shown), suggesting that the protein with a faster electrophoretic mobility is either a degradation product or an isoform of N. In the case of the virion N, Western blot analyses indicated that the band corresponding to N protein consistently migrated somewhat slower than the cellular N (Fig. 1B).",

One-eighth of the volume of the TRIZOL-treated cell lysate was used for denaturing gel electrophoresis.

A second, slower phosphorylated band, appearing to be slightly larger than the 36.4-kDa marker, was determined to be a cellular protein because it was also clearly present in the uninfected cell lysate control.

IBV Beaudette-infected Vero cells were pulse labeled for 0.5 h with 35S-methionine at 7.5 h p.i, before chasing with excess cold methionine for 0.5 h (that is, 8 h p.i.) to 3.5 h (that is, 11.5 h p.i.) when the infected cells were harvested. IBV N protein was isolated by immunoprecipitation at saturating concentrations of rabbit anti-N-polyclonal antibody, such that all N in the infected cell lysates was precipitated. N protein in cell lysates was consistently detected after 30 min of pulse labeling, whereas labeled N was not detected with a 15-min pulse-label with 35S-methionine. After labeling for 30 min, media containing an excess of unlabeled methionine were added for varying lengths of time in order to dilute or chase the label from N. Maximum incorporation of the label was observed after the 1.5 h of chase (Figs. 3A and B). As can be seen from the graphic representation of the densitometric analyses of the bands, using a phosphor imager (Fig. 3B), there was a slight decrease in the intensity of the band until the 2.5-h chase period when an increase in intensity was observed at the 3- and 3.5-h chase periods (Fig. 3A). The intensity of 35S-labeled band resulting from the 2- and 2.5-h chase corresponded, respectively, to 75% and 82% of the 1.5-h chase period band intensity. After the 3- and 3.5-h chase with unlabeled methionine, the band intensity corresponded, respectively, to 85% and 92% of the band intensity for the 1.5-h chase. The decrease in the band intensity was never greater than 50%. If we interpret the stability as beginning with 1.5 h, the time of maximum incorporation, it can be deduced that the N protein is stable for at least 2 h. N protein alone was immunoprecipitated as shown by Western blot analysis using chicken anti-IBV antibody (Fig. 1B). No bands were obtained when lysates from uninfected cells were used for immunoprecipitation, using rabbit-anti-N polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3A) or when using non-specific rabbit-anti-reticuloendotheliosis virus gag antibody as a control (data not shown). A faint band slightly larger than 48 kDa was obtained on exposure to an imaging plate when rabbit preimmune serum was used for immunoprecipitation of infected cell lysates. This band did not react with anti-IBV-Gray chicken serum as determined by the Western blot analysis (data not shown) and therefore was not considered a viral protein.",

Figs. 4A and B show that phosphate incorporation continued throughout the 1.5-h chase period, reaching a maximum at the 2-h chase period and then dropped to 96% and 70% of this value observed in the 2.5- and 3-h chase period, respectively. Since phosphate was readily available in the cell, intracellular phosphate pools would be difficult to replace. Labeling on the N protein might increase during the chase period due to labeled cellular-derived phosphate. Similar results obtained for two experiments indicated that the amount of phosphorylation of N does not fall below 70% of the maximum label incorporation during a 1-h chase.",

The hours p.i. were calculated as the treatment variable and the ratio was used as the response. A significant linear trend (P < 0.0001) in the ratios was obtained (Fig. 6\n). Therefore, there was a direct correlation in the increase in phosphorylation of the N with time. The 32P:3H cpm ratios of the N protein (0.35 for CEK cells or 0.24 for Vero cells) at time point 1, that is 7 h p.i., were significantly different (P\n < 0.05) from the ratios (1.22 for CEK cells or 2.52 for Vero cells) at time point 5 (16 h p.i.) using the least significant difference (LSD) test (Table 1). The significance of these differences was also confirmed by the Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls test and Tukey's studentized range test multiple comparison procedures (Kuehl, 2000).

While the coronavirus N has been implicated in transcription, replication, translation, and packaging of the viral genome, it has been postulated that phosphorylation might functionally regulate the N protein (Masters et al., 1990). Following an M.O.I. of 5, synthesis of 35S-methionine-labeled MHV N was detected 4.5 h p.i. (Cheley and Anderson, 1981). With an M.O.I. between 2 and 3, we found that both synthesis of IBV N and phosphorylation could be detected by 6 h p.i. until at least 18 h p.i. Because differential phosphorylation might regulate the multiple functions of the N, it would be of interest to determine the sites of phosphorylation at varying times during infection.",

The stability of N phosphorylation would decrease with removal of 32Pi from the protein. Our results indicated that the degree of phosphorylation of N was greatest only when chased for 2 h. The delay in removing the viral 32Pi may relate to the presence of the intracellular 32Pi obtained from other cellular processes. The intensity of labeled phosphate dropped down to 70% of this maximum value when chased for an additional hour.

However, the 32P:3H cpm ratio of the virion N protein from Vero cells was greater than the ratio from CEK cells. The electrophoretic mobility of the virion N during SDS\u2013PAGE was slightly slower than the cellular N, as might be expected with additional phosphorylation. In the case of measles virus, the nucleoprotein, phosphorylated on both serine and threonine, is preferentially assembled into the nucleocapsids (Gombart et al., 1995). Increased phosphorylation could relate to preferential binding of N protein to viral RNA for packaging or assembly into nucleocapsids. In the case of Chandipura virus, homodimerization of the phosphoprotein (P) occurs via the N-terminal 46 amino acids of the protein only after phosphorylation of this region (Raha et al., 2000). A global conformational change in the N-terminal domain of the P of the Chandipura virus is induced by phosphorylation (Raha et al., 1999). Similarly, phosphorylation of the IBV N protein could induce a conformational change that promotes both N\u2013N interactions and RNA binding. N\u2013N interactions may be important in nucleocapsid assembly and in compacting the nucleocapsid. The N associated with virions was mostly resistant to CIAP treatment which targets serine- and threonine-bound phosphates and to RNase treatment. It is likely that the hyperphosphorylated form of the IBV N protein binds genomic RNA thereby forming tight compact complexes that are resistant to enzyme treatment. Narayanan et al. (2003) showed that the MHV N protein in the virion nucleocapsid and in the intracellular genome-length RNP complexes that bound to the viral M protein was tightly self-associated, such that its association was retained even after extensive RNAse A treatment. However, this was not the case with RNP complexes formed with subgenomic RNA (Narayanan et al., 2003).",

In addition to the differences in avian versus primate origin, respectively, the CEK cells are not immortalized and make interferon, as compared with Vero cells that are deficient in interferon genes.

Virus was harvested at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h p.i. and quantified in terms of plaque forming units (pfu) per 200 \u03bcl of media (Darbyshire et al., 1978). Two hundred microliters of 10-fold serial dilutions of the supernatant containing the virus were used for the plaque assay. The experiments were done in triplicates.",
