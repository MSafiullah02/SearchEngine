CCL3 propagates inflammation by further recruitment and activation of PMNs. Data from different experimental models, including a murine acute lung injury model, suggest that soluble as well as membrane bound MMP-8 degrades MIP-1\u03b1 and therefore mitigates inflammation, resulting in improved survival [4]. In turn, genetically deleting MIP 1-\u03b1 in MMP-8 knockout mice also reduced lung inflammation and mortality, thus suggesting an important role for an \u201cMMP-8/MIP-1\u03b1 axis\u201d in acute inflammation [4].",

For example, preliminary analysis of the GenIMS study showed that the MMP-8 non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1940475 was associated with 90-day mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and the presence of the A allele was associated with better survival [8]. The rs1940475 SNP causes a point mutation in the pro-domain of MMP-8. This results in an amino acid substitution of glutamic acid for lysine at position 87, thereby rendering it less amenable to activation, which results in functional suppression [9]. As such, its ability to function as a negative feedback regulator in inflammation is impaired, leading to an over-recruitment of PMNs which may lead to tissue and organ damage.",

Compared to knockout animals, MMP-8 wild-type (WT) mice had higher levels of PMN membrane bound MMP, which is likely to be the key bioactive form of the enzyme. In turn, MMP-8 inactivated MIP 1-\u03b1, and genetically deleting MIP 1-\u03b1 in MMP-8 knockout mice decreased the increased lung inflammation and mortality, thus emphasizing a possible role for a \u201cMMP-8/MIP-1\u03b1 axis\u201d in acute inflammation.",

Studies to date have largely reported associations between MMP-8 plasma levels and/or MMP-8 genotypes and clinical outcomes without elaborating the underlying mechanisms. Most of these studies report a similar trend, i.e., higher MMP-8 levels are associated with worse clinical disease. For instance, MMP-8 is not only strongly associated with acute inflammatory states in humans such as ARDS [18] but also states with chronic inflammation and neutrophilia such as cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, periodontal, and chronic skin diseases [19\u201322]. For example, MMP-8 levels correlated well with C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in a study of patients with ARDS [23]. Alternatively, several functional MMP-8 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been linked to clinical outcomes as well. For instance, our preliminary analysis from the GenIMS study showed that the rs1940475 genotype was associated with 90-day mortality in patients with CAP, and patients homozygous for the A allele had the best outcomes [8].",

In addition, subjects with the A allele also showed a stronger clinical response to LPS infusion in terms of drop in MAP and increase in body temperature. As clinical studies have shown a higher pro-inflammatory response to be associated with poorer survival [24], our findings of higher peak TNF and IL-6 levels in AA homozygous individuals are not consistent with higher survival rates in our preliminary analysis of AA homozygous individuals with CAP [8]. Conversely, patients homozygous for the G allele had the highest peak MIP-1 alpha levels. MIP-1\u03b1 usually parallels TNF and IL-6 response in a TNF independent way [25]. Bronchoalveolar fluid levels of MIP-1 \u03b1 were inversely correlated with lung compliance in a small human cohort of ARDS patients but not associated with outcomes. These preliminary findings warrant further study in larger cohorts.",

First, although we calculated a sample size of 40 to be sufficient to detect a 40 % difference in peak MIP-1\u03b1 levels between AA and GG genotypes, our study was not adequately powered to assess any differences beyond that; hence, all additional analyses must be viewed as exploratory. Second, while our results suggest an association between peak plasma cytokine levels and MMP-8 genotypes and thus a role for MMP-8 in cytokine regulation, we do not have insight how this affects downstream cell trafficking to actual sites of infection. Hence, additional studies using alternative compartmental models such as inhaled LPS will be helpful to better understand the role of MMP-8 in ALI and pneumonia. Third, we did not measure MMP-8 levels in our healthy volunteers. Fourth, our study was conducted in healthy male volunteers, and thus, our results may not apply to females. Currently, the exact link between MMP-8 genotypes and plasma levels/activity levels is not well understood. While some studies report a clear dose\u2013response relationship between MMP-8 genotypes and activity levels, we failed to show a significant association in ex vivo incubation experiments (unpublished data). However, our preliminary data suggest that the rs1940475 SNP results in a conformational change of the active site, which makes the enzyme less amenable to activation [9]. This needs to be verified in further studies.",
