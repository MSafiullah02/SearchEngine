In addition, the conformational properties of G4 are largely influenced by the environmental conditions, in particular by the presence of monovalent ions such as K+ or Na+. These features grant high degree of polymorphism to G4 arrangements and make them suitable to differential recognition. In addition, relatively mild changes in the experimental setting or addition of specific low molecular weight ligands may lead a G-rich sequence to fold/unfold, hence conferring G4s the characteristics of a molecular switch.",

In particular, guanines are over-represented in the terminal repeating sequences of chromosomes (telomeres) and in promoter regions of genes, especially proto-oncogenes, such as c-myc, c-kit, bcl-2, VEGF, H-ras and N-ras, as well as in other human genes. In addition, G4s can be selectively formed at the RNA level further contributing to a modulation of the information flow leading to proteins [3], [4]. These findings suggest a role of G4 in controlling biological events including chromosome protection and gene expression [5], [6], [7], [8] and foresee several potential biophysical, diagnostic and therapeutic applications for G4. Recent reviews cover this matter thoroughly [9], [10], [11].",

Its complex with thrombin provides one of the very few X-ray structures of a G4 bound to a protein thus far available (Fig. 1\n) [16]. The aptamer is sandwiched between two thrombin molecules and binds (largely through salt bridges) the fibrinogen exosite of one and the heparin binding site in the C-terminal region of the other thrombin molecule. The TGT sequence forming one of the three loops is involved in a hydrophobic cluster near the fibrinogen exosite (Ile24, His71, Ile79, Tyr117), whereas a T belonging to one of the TT loops associates with His91, Pro92 and Trp237 of the heparin binding site.

Substitution of d-ribose with UNA derivative may produce either destabilization or stabilization of the aptamer G4 structure depending upon its position along the DNA chain. This is likely related to a higher degree of local flexibility produced by the open ribose. Particularly effective was the oligomer modified at position 7, which was found to be more efficient than the original aptamer both in protein binding and in anticoagulant activity [17].",

Recently a single-chain antibody selected by phage display and competitive selection was reported to be effective for recognition of intramolecular G4s and clearly discriminating between two parallel arrangements found in a protooncogene promoter [39]. Furthermore, the same authors selected a single-chain G4 binding antibody by methods comparable to those reported above, but with negative selection against only duplex DNA. The identified protein showed a broad range of affinities toward selected genomic G4 sequences but no detectable binding to the duplex DNA. This antibody can hence represent a valuable tool to investigate the existence and function of G4 within the genome. In fact, a correlation was found between the effects of the antibody upon gene expression and the occurrence of putative quadruplex sequences at either the promoter or the terminus of genes. Interestingly, production of the antibody in human cells can significantly up- or down-regulate gene expression, which suggests a regulatory role of G4 in this process [40].",

            "text": "It has been known since over 15 years that telomerase is unable to elongate G4 folded substrates, a principle that justifies a chemotherapeutic approach based on G4 stabilizer. However, other DNA binding proteins can promote G4 at telomeric level. In Oxytricha nova, the ends of macronuclear chromosomes are bound by telomere end-binding protein (TEBP). This protein is formed by two subunits, \u03b1 and \u03b2. TEBP\u03b1 efficiently binds single stranded 3\u2032 telomeric repeat allocating it in a deep cleft. TEBP\u03b2 heterodimerizes in the presence of DNA leading to an \u03b1: \u03b2:single-stranded(ss) DNA ternary complex, in which the nucleic acid is bound between the N-terminal domain of \u03b1 and a globular region of \u03b2 [48]. Although the \u03b2 subunit does not bind the terminal telomeric repeat by itself, it greatly accelerates G4 formation with oligonucleotide substrates corresponding to the Oxytricha (T4G4T4G4) and Tetrahymena (T2G4T2G4) telomeric repeats at physiological conditions [49]. Interestingly, a higher resolution electron density map of the above mentioned ternary complex evidenced additional binding by a G4 structure located apart from the ssDNA binding site (Fig. 2\n). In this complex TEBP is in contact with the folded DNA through interactions which are extensively of electrostatic type. In addition, the protein\u2013nucleic acid contact surface is relatively small. From the structural data it was not clear if the observed binding was physiologically relevant as it could have been promoted by the crystallization packaging [50]. Indeed, it is the C-terminal basic domain of the \u03b2 subunit (absent in the crystallized complex) that is actually considered as the G4 binding element [49]. Interestingly, the G4 stabilizing effect was shown to be modulated in vivo by cell cycle dependent protein phosphorylation. However, the preference for stabilization of antiparallel arrangements was demonstrated to be the result of the co-presence of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunit [51]. The \u03b2 subunit was subsequently shown to have a partial sequence homology to TPP1 in shelterin whereas TEBP\u03b1 corresponds to vertebrate POT1 [52].",

Binding affinity and selectivity for G4 was found to be located in the N-terminal (RHAU specific motif) conserved region. This was evidenced using the equivalent Drosophila protein, sharing with DHX the amino-terminal domain only. The high binding affinities exhibited towards G4 RNA (K\nd in the pM range) suggests that this structure is preferentially recognized by DHX and may represent a suitable in vivo target, which is unique among RNA helicases [100]. Very recently, the binding of DHX36 to a G-rich sequence of telomerase RNA (hTR), located in the 5\u2032-terminal region, has been examined. Accordingly, recognition did not involve the helicase domain, but the N-terminal accessory domain of the enzyme, which binds specifically to parallel G4s resolved by the helicase domain. This process affects mature hTR formation and, as a result, the levels of telomere elongation by telomerase. The idea follows that G4 folding may protect nascent hTR from degradation, the subsequent resolvase action favoring RNA elongation to reach the mature form [101].",

Six Pc-1 binding proteins were isolated from NIH3T3 cellular extracts, and UP1 was identified among them. Subsequent electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed tight binding (nanomolar Kd) of the Pc-1 oligonucleotides to hnRNP A1 and A3.

In fact, UP1 forms a ternary complex with telomerase and telomeric RNA. NMR chemical shift perturbation analysis suggests that telomerase RNA engages both BD1 and BD2 in the binary complex with UP1. Addition of telomeric DNA produces a ternary complex by displacing RNA from the BD1 site. Hence, the ribonucleoprotein can recruit (and unfold) telomeric DNA to telomerase by effectively bridging them. Incidentally, formation of a ternary complex may explain the bell shaped dependence of telomerase activity upon UP1 concentration.

In particular, nucleolin binds and stabilizes NHE III of c-myc promoter thus it might act as an oncosuppressor by decreasing promoter activity in a G4 dependent way [122].

MRFs heterodimerize with E-proteins, producing an E-box motif which recognizes d(CANNTG) sequences in muscle tissue differentiating genes. However, homodimerization of MRF can switch binding preferences to G4 motifs. This raises the possibility that transcriptional activity might be modulated by the relative homo/heterodimer distribution. The presence of G4 would favour homodimers, hence acting as transcription silencing factors [141]. However, this is not the case, since G4s substantially enhance MRF(MyoD)/E-box driven expression of a reporter gene (luciferase). A possible mechanism compatible with all these findings envisages a G4 structure in the E-box promoter recruiting (transcriptionally ineffective) MyoD homodimers. In the presence of the E-protein partner, MyoD forms an heterodimer which releases the myogenic factor from the G4 and binds the neighboring E-box motif to activate transcription of the genes coding for muscle proteins [142].",

Computational approaches of the transcripts of known protein coding genes indicate high incidence of potential G4 structures both at 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTR locations.

This abnormal expansion produces hypermethylation and silencing of the FMR1 gene which leads to loss of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). In the pathological conditions, the G-rich expanded repeat is occurring both at the genomic DNA (non-coding strand) and at an RNA level, both of which could be exploited to modulate FMR1 expression and translation. To assess the functional consequences of this hypothesis, a long CGG sequence containing 99 repeats was positioned upstream to a reporter gene: it efficiently reduced mRNA translation and depressed mRNA utilization in human cells transfected with plasmids bearing FMR1 promoter-dependent reporter gene. Parallel G-quadruplex disrupting proteins hnRNP A and CBF-A effectively increased reporter mRNA translation, whereas protein mutants unable to unwind G4 were inactive. The emerging mechanism foresees a translational block produced by the folded G4 structures of the long CGG repeat sequence, reversed by G4 unwinding proteins [157].",

Interestingly, the number of Arg required for RNA binding depends upon the nature of target RNA.

In addition, G4 folding shows a remarkable polymorphism in DNA, which on one hand might improve differential targeting among topological forms, but on the other might render the nucleic acid target ill-defined, hence elusive [172].",

From the nucleic acid side the quadruplex scaffold can be considered as a central core, like a flower\u2019s corolla, with the petals being represented by the loops (each characterized by the direction, number and nature of connecting bases), able to mediate selective recognition of a target protein in a way reminiscent of antigen binding to antibody. In this connection, many G4-based aptamers have been identified and are being investigated as drugs and as diagnostic agents.",
