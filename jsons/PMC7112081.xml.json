            "text": "APN (CD13) is one of the type II cell surface metalloproteases the large glycosylated ectodomain of which has a zinc metal ion at the active site (Mina-Osorio, 2008). It is known that APN serves as a cellular receptor for several alphacoronaviruses, such as TGEV, HCoV-229E and FCoV (Delmas et al., 1992, Yeager et al., 1992, Tresnan et al., 1996). Only very limited data are available indicating that porcine APN (pAPN) plays a role for PEDV infection. Previously, it has been reported that rabbit anti-pAPN polyclonal antibody inhibited PEDV binding to pAPN protein and pre-treatment of Vero E6 cells with a soluble pAPN increased the viral infectivity (Oh et al., 2003). Mature pAPN is a 150-kDa glycosylated protein that is highly expressed in small intestinal mucosa (Oh et al., 2003, Delmas et al., 1992). Li and colleagues demonstrated that MDCK cells, a canine kidney cell line, became susceptible to PEDV infection after transient expression of pAPN; infection was inhibited by anti-pAPN polyclonal antibodies (Li et al., 2007). A swine testicular cell line (ST) that expresses only low levels of the enzyme, is resistant to PEDV infection. However, recombinant ST cells constitutively expressing high levels of pAPN could be infected efficiently (Nam and Lee, 2010). The available data indicate an association between pAPN and PEDV infection, although PEDV can be serially propagated in Vero E6 cells, a monkey cell line which does not express pAPN, if a protease is added for release of virions from the cell surface (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988, Shirato et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The primary target of coronaviruses is the respiratory or intestinal epithelium. Epithelial cell layers form a primary barrier to infection by microorganisms entering their host via body cavities such as the respiratory or intestinal tract (Ren et al., 2006, Cong and Ren, 2014). Epithelial cells grow with a polarized topology that involves the separation of the plasma membrane into apical and basolateral domains (Rossen et al., 1994, Cong and Ren, 2014). It has been demonstrated that the entry and release of several coronaviruses in polarized epithelial cells is restricted to the apical plasma membrane, e.g. TGEV, HCoV-229E and severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Ren et al., 2006, Rossen et al., 1994, Wang et al., 2000, Jia et al., 2005, Tseng et al., 2005). Feline coronavirus (FCoV) and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) mediated apical entry and basolateral release in polarized epithelial cells (Rossen et al., 2001, Rossen et al., 1995, Rossen et al., 1996). The recently identified coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and also the canine coronavirus (CCoV) enter and exit at both sites of polarized epithelial cells (Pratelli, 2011, Tao et al., 2013). These examples show that coronaviruses have evolved different ways to interact with polarized cells. As this knowledge is important to understand how a virus gets across the epithelial barrier, the polarity of virus infection has to be determined for each virus. Though PEDV has become of increasing epidemiological importance in recent years, the polarized entry and release of PEDV in epithelial cells has not been documented.",

As shown in Fig. 1B, viral RNA was detected both in the intracellular fraction and in the extracellular medium.

For Vero E6 cells we have shown previously that cell develop a transepithelial electrical resistance (Ren et al., 2006). For convenience, the tightness of the monolayers was determined by adding medium (phenol red) to the apical compartment to a slightly higher level than in the basolateral compartment (Cerneus et al., 1993). No leakage of culture medium from the apical to the basolateral compartment occurred from 4 to 8 day post-seeding (dps), indicating that Vero E6 and IEC cell monolayers were already completely tight by 4\u20138 dps (Rossen et al., 1994). To determine the polarity of PEDV entry into Vero E6 and IECs, cell monolayers were inoculated with PEDV from either site of the cell layer, i.e. virus was added to the medium in the upper or lower chambers facing the apical or basolateral site of the epithelial cell layer, respectively. The efficiency of infection was monitored by IFA in cells infected at the indicated times post-seeding. As shown in\nFig. 3A (Vero E6 cells) and B (IECs), PEDV infected cells from the apical site at all times points analyzed. By constrast, basolateral infection was successful only up to three (Vero) or four dps (IEC), respectively. Two days later, the susceptibility of both cell lines to basolateral infection was greatly reduced and by day six (Vero) and seven (IEC), both cell lines were resistant to infection, if the inoculum was applied to the basolateral chamber (Fig. 3A and B). This result illustrates the progress of polarization of these cells and shows that PEDV is able to infect polarized cells via the apical membrane domain. This conclusion is supported by the finding that treatment with ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) prior to inoculation rendered the cells susceptible to infection from the basolateral site (Figs. 3A and B). Depletion of calcium by EGTA treatment abolishes the functional integrity of the tight junctions between the cells and thus the polarized distribution of virus receptors (Rossen et al., 1994).",

Recently, Zhao et al. showed IPEC-J2 cells (a model of normal intestinal epithelial cells) were susceptible to TGEV and PEDV infection through destroying the epithelial barrier (Zhao et al., 2014). Since then, little information has been reported regarding the polarized infection characteristics of this virus. To further determine whether a cell line derived from the target tissue was susceptible to PEDV infection, immortalized epithelial cells of the swine small intestine (IEC) were investigated in this study. A porcine intestinal epithelial cell (IECs) line was used by Xu et al., 2013a, Xu et al., 2013b to investigate the subcellular localization and function of PEDV N protein. The analysis of IECs for susceptibility to infection was of interest since enterocytes are the target cells of PEDV. In contrast to other group I coronaviruses like TGEV, a distinct characteristic of PEDV infection is the requirement of trypsin in the medium for in vitro infection. Interestingly, we found that PEDV can be serially propagated in IECs in the presence of trypsin. PEDV was detected by real-time PCR in intracellular and extracellular spaces in IECs (Fig. 1B). We were able to serially propagate PEDV on IECs for 10 passages and the virus titer was 8\u00d7105\n TCID50/ml. We assume that PEDV can be adapted to IECs, as these cells are derived from the natural target organ of PEDV, the porcine intestine. It remains to be shown in the future that the failed isolates of PEDV can be grown on IEC or whether they also need adaptation like CV777 which has to be adapted to be growth in Vero E6 cells as several blind passages.",

            "text": "Previous reports suggested that pAPN may play a role in mediating PEDV infection (Oh et al., 2003, Li et al., 2007, Nam and Lee, 2010); our data confirm the importance of pAPN for PEDV infection. APN is abundantly expressed in the brush border membrane of the small intestine and the kidney, whereas its expression is detected to a lesser extent in the liver, lung and colon. In ST cells, pAPN is expressed in minor amounts (Delmas et al., 1992, Nam and Lee, 2010, Kenny and Maroux, 1982). A recent report showed that over-expression of pAPN in ST cells could rescue PEDV replication in the ST cells (Oh et al., 2003). We found that pAPN is expressed in higher amounts in IECs than it is in ST cells (data not shown). To examine whether pAPN serves as an essential receptor for PEDV, we analyzed whether an increase or decrease of pAPN expression affects infection by PEDV. High expression levels of pAPN were found to increase the susceptibility of the cells to infection by PEDV (Fig. 2C). Interference with pAPN expression in IECs by siRNA inhibited PEDV infection. The immune electron microscopy (IEM) results are also consistent with PEDV entry into IECs via pAPN. Taken together, these data indicate that pAPN plays a crucial role in PEDV infection. Like several other coronaviruses, such as FCoV, TGEV, CCoV, and HCoV-229E that use APN as a receptor (Tusell et al., 2007), PEDV also enters cells by a pAPN-dependent mechanism. There is, however, also a difference between PEDV and TGEV as far as the involvement of APN in infection is concerned. PEDV requires larger amounts of this protease. ST cells which express a low amount of APN are susceptible to TGEV infection but refractory to PEDV infection (Nam and Lee, 2010). On the other hand, Vero cells are susceptible to infection by PEDV but resistant to infection by TGEV. These differences suggest that recognition of APN by PEDV is characterized by a lower affinity and by a less stringent species specificity when compared to the interaction of TGEV with APN. Ongoing research tries to find out whether APN of Vero E6 cells can interact with PEDV. To explain the differences between PEDV and TGEV, one should also consider the possibility that a factor different from APN may also contribute to the entry process of PEDV. Cooperation with this factor and with APN may be required for efficient infection of the target cells of PEDV, the intestinal epithelial cells.",

            "text": "As epithelial cells are primary target cells for coronaviruses such as PEDV and also essential entities required for virus pathogenesis (Tashiro et al., 1990), we explored the interaction of PEDV with polarized Vero E6 cells and IECs. Our data demonstrate that PEDV enters Vero E6 and IECs preferentially via the apical plasma membrane and is also released from this site of polarized epithelial cells. This finding is consistent with a localized infection restricted in the intestine. Several studies have investigated the interaction of coronaviruses and other viruses with epithelial cells using a similar approach (Ren et al., 2006, Rossen et al., 1994, Wang et al., 2000, Jia et al., 2005, Tseng et al., 2005, Rossen et al., 2001, Rossen et al., 1995, Rossen et al., 1996, Pratelli, 2011, Tao et al., 2013, Fuller et al., 1984). Though entry into and egress from polarized cells for several coronaviruses is restricted to the apical plasma membrane, other coronaviruses show a different pattern (see Introduction). Therefore, entry and release of PEDV could not be predicted. Our results show that both the early and late phase of the replication cycle of PEDV is associated with the apical site of polarized cells. The co-localization of pAPN and PEDV in polarized IECs as well as the observations confocal microscopy (Fig. 5 A) highlight the importance of pAPN for the polarized infection by PEDV (Fig. 5B).",
