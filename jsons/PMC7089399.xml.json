            "text": "Disasters can have devastating effects on physical and economic systems. Specifically, infectious biological disasters, whether they are natural (e.g., SARS, influenza pandemics, and other recent disease outbreaks) or man-made (e.g., bioterrorism), can have devastating consequences if not managed properly (Hawryluck et al. 2005; Bartlett 2006). Seasonal disease outbreaks are considered natural hazards that occur periodically based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC 2014). In more severe cases, an influenza pandemic disaster may render significant damage to the sectors of a given regional economic network. In the wake of an influenza pandemic, workforce productivity is highly impacted since employees are unable to come to work and opt to stay at home either because they are sick or because they take care of other family members. Such situation creates a state of dysfunctionality of economic systems since workforce is a critical component to the creation of output for practically all economic sectors. The extent of the impact of workforce disruption depends on the level of availability on the workforce. Moreover, the inherent interdependencies may generate ripple effects across the economic sectors. In an interdependent economic setting, some sectors rely on the output of other sectors for ideal production. Therefore, a given sector in a dysfunctional state means that it cannot meet its ideal production level and will fail to provide the necessary resources for other sectors to meet their ideal production. Thus, the cascading effect of the influenza pandemic will reduce the production of goods and services within the general economy. Pandemic disaster risk analysis has gained increasing attention lately especially with the recent outbreaks of infectious diseases, which resulted in significant disruptions and considerable economic losses.",

            "text": "The study of disasters has been gaining a lot of attention and merit in recent years. Several policies related to disaster risk management and emergency response have been adopted to help avoid the devastating consequences from extreme events (Department of Homeland Security 2008, 2009; President of the United States 2003, 2011). A disaster such as influenza pandemic may have devastating effects on interdependent workforce sectors. Therefore, it is important to understand the scope of the effects of pandemic on critical economic systems. Influenza pandemics can be characterized using two parameters: attack rate and basic reproduction number R\n0. The attack rate measures the proportion of people who have contracted the virus in a given population. The basic reproduction number R\n0 measures the expected number of new individuals who contract the virus given their contact with one infected individual (Germann et al. 2006). An influenza pandemic could cause substantial reductions in the availability of workforce sectors due to their illness or the necessity of providing care for other family members. Such scenario may lead to economic disruptions across many regions and economic sectors. The extent of disruptions depends on factors such as the percentage dependence of a sector on the workforce, as well as the resilience of that sector. Also, sectors may be ranked differently in light of the two risk metrics to be explored in subsequent sections of this paper, namely the level of inoperability and economic loss. It is also possible to encounter unexpected perturbations throughout the recovery trajectory of the economic sectors. Therefore, it is essential to model the adverse effects of pandemics given the significant losses that may be incurred by such disasters. Results from such modeling effort serve to provide insights for developing preparedness plans and risk mitigation strategies.",

Therefore, it is difficult to model the trajectory of influenza infection in social settings. For a moderate influenza epidemic, the urban area attack rate is estimated to be around 33 % (Chao et al. 2010). Ferguson et al. (2006) estimate that a moderate influenza with an attack rate of 28 % would cause 55 % of the population to be infected, with a peak occurring after 60 days after the onset of infection. Also, Ferguson et al. (2006) estimate that in the aftermath of an influenza epidemic, more than a third of the infection is transmitted within the workplace or the school. Other forms of transmission occur in the households or the community. Also, a percentage workforce absenteeism of 9 % is reported with an average of 7 workdays lost in the case of a moderate influenza. For a severe influenza pandemic, the worker absenteeism rate could vary from 10 to 40 % depending on the transmission rate and susceptibility of the population (Ferguson et al. 2006). According to FluWorkLoss, a program designed to estimate the workdays lost, a 35 % attack rate would likely result in 3.4 % total workdays lost in a timespan of 56 days.",

            "text": "The H1N1 pandemic in 2009 affected many regions in the world, starting from North America and spreading globally. It turned out to be more aggressive than the typical seasonal influenza and caused hospitalizations of children and adults as well as people with chronic conditions (World Health Organization 2010; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2012). Halder et al. (2010) estimate that the H1N1 influenza had an attack rate between 27 and 37 % with an average of 32.5 %. Also, the influenza pandemic reached its peak within 45 days and caused an illness rate of 6.6 % of the total population. The 2009 H1N1 was estimated to have a value of R\n0 ranging from 1.4 to 1.6 (Fraser et al. 2009). As far as the estimated consequences of the 2009 H1N1 influenza on the workforce, the Canadian Labor Statistics Center reported in November 2009, 9 % of total national workforce lost almost 20 work hours for the month of November (Statistics Canada 2013). Many researchers have studied the difference between H1N1 pandemic and seasonal influenza in terms of the number of workdays lost and absenteeism rates. The number of workdays lost varies with age and susceptibility to the infection. Specifically, a person who is younger and more illness prone will have a higher likelihood of contracting the virus. It has been estimated that the absenteeism rate and the total workdays missed due to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic are significantly higher than due to seasonal influenza. This suggests that influenza pandemics pose higher risks to the workforce and economic systems. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic resulted in 0.2 % of total workdays lost per year, compared to the seasonal influenza that usually causes a loss of 0.08 % of total annual workdays (Schanzer et al. 2011). On the average, the H1N1 pandemic caused a loss of 25 work hours, whereas the seasonal influenza work hours lost are about 14. Moreover, the absenteeism rate due to the H1N1 pandemic was estimated to be around 13 % of total workers, while the seasonal influenza absenteeism rate is around 12 % (Schanzer et al. 2011). The most impacted sector in the aftermath of the H1N1 pandemic was the medical and nursing services. Specifically, 56.6 % of the medical staff estimated having lost more than 1 day of work. Also, 8 % of total workforce reported having lost at least 5 days of work (Considine et al. 2011).",

The study used two metrics to assess the consequences associated with influenza pandemic, namely the level of inoperability and economic loss. Inoperability is a dimensionless metric ranging from 0 (ideal scenario) to 1 (total failure), which measures the extent to which an economic sector is underperforming relative to the ideal scenario. In contrast, economic loss evaluates the actual financial consequence associated with the degraded production level of the sector. The findings show that values of the inoperability level for the peak time period range from 0.3 to 12.66 %, while the cumulative economic loss for all sectors ranges from $5.2b to $9.4b. These results have been found to be compatible with independent estimates made by the World Health Organization (2003).",

Results show that for relatively mild pandemics, large implementation of vaccination can decrease the number of ill people to <10 %. Alternatively, the large deployment of antivirals can significantly help contain the pandemic. A highly aggressive influenza pandemic requires social procedures as well as vaccines and antivirals to halt the spread of the influenza pandemic.",

In the aftermath of an influenza pandemic, there is a high level of workforce absenteeism due to their own sickness or caring for others. This absenteeism leads to a reduction in the productivity of economic sectors. To quantify the magnitude of the reduction in productivity of the economic sectors, we use the inoperability level and economic loss metrics. The modeling and simulation incorporated in this work are aimed at tracking the level of inoperability values throughout the recovery period by taking into account the economic resilience of sectors, or their ability to react to the disaster and recover back to their initial level of functionality. The level of inoperability is assumed to diminish as time progresses due to the economic resilience of the sectors. However, the occurrence of some unexpected event may alter the decreasing trend in the level of inoperability. For instance, in the event of a second wave of infection, more people will likely contract the disease, hence increasing the level of inoperability across various economic sectors.",

Specifically, the study models and simulates the time-varying level of inoperability of economic sectors due to an influenza pandemic. This research takes into account the uncertainties in the level of inoperability and how they may be dynamically updated throughout the recovery period. The level of inoperability measure could be modeled using a probability distribution, which could be updated every time there is a new observed event. The new event could either bring an improvement to the level of inoperability, such as may occur when implementing risk mitigation strategies against the influenza pandemic (e.g., vaccines, antivirals, or social distancing measures). On the other hand, another event could exacerbate the degradation in the functionality of the system, hence leading to increased levels of inoperability. This could be the case when there is a new wave of influenza that could result in a spike in the number of infected people.",

This model divides the economy into a set of interdependent sectors that produce goods and services and also consume products and services from other sectors (Leontief 1936). Therefore, under such model assumptions, these sectors depend on each other to meet their ideal production requirements. Developing an effective risk mitigation plan requires exploring the complexity of the interdependencies between sectors in an economy (The Infrastructure Security Partnership 2006). The complexity of interdependent economic sectors has been featured in many studies (Santos et al. 2012; Orsi and Santos 2010; Santos et al. 2009). Table 1 illustrates the economic sectors classification used in the modeling of this research.\n",

The I\u2013O model takes into account the cascading effect generated by an initial perturbation across a set of interconnected sectors.

This has developed the complexity of economic systems and added more interdependencies across economic sectors.

Such approach enables the measurement of the inoperability level of a sector given its inherent resilience and also taking into consideration its dependence on other economic sectors. For instance, an economic sector might be very resilient to the disaster, but its high dependence on other inoperable sectors will cause its productivity to suffer at a much higher rate.

The first wave spans over the weekly time interval [0,28] and is defined as a triangular distribution between 0 and 28 weeks, with a peak inoperability level of 0.045 at week 20.

We develop a simulation algorithm for beta distributions with a given mode value that serves as a calibration of the contribution of the impacts of both DIIM and the new disruption on economic sectors. The simulation in this research is based on Monte Carlo simulation through random number generation from a given probability distribution (Gentle 1998). Therefore, the probability p(t) could be considered as a random variable that follows a beta distribution. The beta distribution is used to model probabilities and proportions. It is defined between 0 and 1, and the shape of the distribution is determined by two parameters. The beta distribution has the property of modeling a set of symmetric or skewed points. The beta distribution is a candidate distribution to use since it has the capability to model bounded random variables such as probability values with support of [0,1]. Many studies have used the beta distribution in modeling proportions and subjective beliefs of individuals (Alvarez and Brehm 1995, 1997; Brehm and Scott 1993; Mebane 2000; Paolino 1998). The beta distribution is particularly suitable for modeling the level of perturbation (as well as the resulting inoperability), which is known to have a lower limit of 0 and an upper limit of 1. The bounded interval of the beta distribution provides an alternative to describe the uncertainty in probability of occurrence of a new perturbation. The beta distribution could be described by shape parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2, which could be set to generate a distribution with a desired mode (or most likely value).",

It is a different but complementary metric to assess the consequences of a disaster, such as a disease pandemic. In contrast to the level of inoperability, it is a more intuitive way to convey how critically a sector has been impacted by the pandemic. Measuring economic loss allows generating a different ranking for critically impacted sectors. Also, the results will help identify the sector that incurs the highest monetary losses following the pandemic. More importantly, we can evaluate that the sector losses exceed a criticality threshold that may lead to an irrecoverable collapse of the economic sector. Economic loss equals multiplying the level of inoperability and the planned output level. Multiplying the percentage of output degradation by the normal output of the sector in dollar amount gives the monetary value of the loss incurred by the sector. Our analysis considers 1-week increments; hence, economic loss is mathematically expressed as follows:12\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{loss}}_{i} (t) = \\frac{1}{52}*X_{i} *q_{i} (t)$$\\end{document}lossi(t)=152\u2217Xi\u2217qi(t)where loss\ni(t) represents the cumulative monetary loss at time t, X\ni represents the output of sector i during a given year, and q\ni(t) denotes time t level of inoperability for sector i.

The DIIM incorporates the effect of resilience and sector interdependencies. Notably, the resilience parameter in the DIIM has the tendency to create a downward trend for the inoperability of a sector. On the other hand, the new perturbation has a certain trend that also influences the trajectory of inoperability of economic sectors. This new perturbation could have two possible trends:Upward trend of inoperability in modeling the new perturbation leading to the deterioration of the system. Such disruption could be due to a new wave of influenza pandemic or the evolution of the virus. For instance, in the H1N1 pandemic of 2009, there were two consecutive waves of influenza that increased the inoperability level of economic sectors as modeled by FluWorkLoss. Specifically, as the first wave vanished, the sectors gained productivity momentum as workforce availability improved. However, another wave of influenza hit the workforce, and absenteeism rate further increased, which drives up the inoperability. An increase in inoperability level values leads to the deterioration of the economic system. Moreover, the degree of increase in the inoperability level depends on the level of criticality of the new disruption. For example, if the influenza virus mutates into a stronger type that spreads very quickly through humans, workforce availability will deteriorate leading to a significant increase in inoperability levels.Downward pattern in inoperability when modeling the new disruption leading to the improvement of the system. Such perturbation could be due to the deployment of risk mitigation strategies such as vaccines, antivirals, or social distancing. Each risk mitigation strategy has its own effectiveness in reducing the impact of the disaster. The level of effectiveness of the risk mitigation strategy depends on the portfolio of measures taken and the intensity of their application. For instance, a portfolio of strategies could include a large deployment of both vaccines and social distancing measures in a community of sick individuals. Such measures can substantially curtail the impact of the influenza, therefore limiting the spread of the influenza virus. This implies that the absenteeism rate will tend to decrease, leading to higher productivity of economic sectors. This is reflected in a significant decay in the trajectory of inoperability.\n",

However, the starting point of the decaying trend is dependent on the last value of inoperability observed after the new disruption is introduced. In the case of the deterioration of the system, the inoperability level at the end of the disruption is higher compared with the inoperability level at the beginning of the disruption. This means that the inoperability level of economic sectors will take longer to vanish due to the effect of the new perturbation. Therefore, we can see an apparent decaying trend of inoperability trajectory after the end of the new perturbation until the economic sector regains its pre-disaster state. In the case of the improvement of the system, the inoperability level will have significantly lower values at the end of the disruption. Hence, for such scenario, the inoperability level vanishes more quickly due to the resilience factor, and economic sectors regain their pre-disaster state more rapidly.",

Also, the prioritization plans and critical sector identification were based on one of the two dimensions, meaning that we rank either the criticality of sectors through their level of inoperability values or their economic loss scores. One potential addition to the present study would be the evaluation of the efficacy of risk mitigation strategies (vaccines, antivirals, social distancing, etc.) in light of the findings of this stochastic analysis. A rigorous study of the effectiveness of the different risk mitigation strategies given the uncertainty of occurrence of a new perturbation would give realistic insights on the recovery trajectory of economic sectors. Therefore, the evaluation of risk mitigation strategies should take into consideration the eventual outcome of the new disruption as well as the probability of its occurrence. For instance, in the case where several risk mitigation strategies are deployed, the inoperability level of economic sectors is expected to decrease. Hence, the appropriate combination of risk mitigation strategies as well as the intensity of the application becomes an important issue to address. Another important feature that should be scrutinized is the combination effect of a perturbation leading to system deterioration and a perturbation leading to system improvement. Specifically, a new disruption leading to system deterioration would tend to increase inoperability level of economic sectors, while a new disruption leading to system improvement would tend to decrease inoperability level of the economic sectors. The recovery trajectory of economic sectors would then be subject to two competing effects. Therefore, to have a holistic analysis of the recovery behavior of sectors, it is imperative to study the effects collectively and generate risk management policies accordingly.",

            "text": "A primary objective of this research is the development of a practical framework for establishing public health policies particularly in terms of prioritizing limited medical personnel or resources. The results of such modeling framework would provide insights into the behavior of critically affected sectors in the event of unprecedented perturbations within the recovery timeline. For instance, sector S56 (social assistance) was the most affected sector in terms of the inoperability level. Further deterioration in the state of critical sectors, such as S56, could further escalate the public health crisis. Hence, critical sectors should be identified and given priority in the event of major disaster such as a pandemic to enable effective deployment of essential personnel and allocation of scarce resources. Furthermore, a novel contribution of this research is the integration of DIIM as a tool for risk analysis, coupled with the modeling a potential stochastic perturbations that could lead to either the deterioration or improvement of economic sectors. Such stochastic analysis would help describe the state of economic sectors and how they react when they are exposed to different scenarios and outcomes. The case studies we demonstrated in this paper can be extended to perform supplementary sensitivity analyses (e.g., by varying recovery times, levels of inoperability, and probability assumptions), which will eventually result in the formulation of robust disaster risk management strategies for health policy making.",

In the baseline scenario for the NCR sectors, federal services and legal services incurred the highest economic losses given their significant output in the region. These sectors have a high GDP due to their huge presence in the region and the large number of employees that work in those sectors. On the other hand, medical service sectors were the ones to report the highest level of inoperability. This is due to the fact that medical service workforce attends to a large population of sick individuals and causes strain to the sector\u2019s already limited capacity. Also, due to their constant interaction with infected individuals, medical personnel tend to have a high susceptibility to contract the influenza virus and therefore incur a high rate of workforce absenteeism. Therefore, we highlighted the effect of any new disruption happening on the critically classified sectors in light of the inoperability level and economic loss metrics, which are S56 (social assistance) and S62 (federal government enterprises), respectively. We modeled the impact of a new perturbation leading to deterioration in terms of both risk metrics for the respective economic sectors. The inoperability level was computed as a weighted average of the inoperability level derived from the DIIM and the inoperability level triggered by the new perturbation.",

The first phase is determined by the combined effect of both DIIM and new perturbation. When the new perturbation leads to system deterioration, there is a significant increase in inoperability level and therefore a significant increase in economic loss. When the new disruption causes system improvement, there is a significant decline in inoperability level and therefore an insignificant change in economic loss. The second phase is a stabilization phase in which the inoperability level calculation is determined solely by DIIM. The inoperability level trajectory decays slowly until it vanishes, and the economic loss trajectory follows a steady state, indicating that the sector has recovered to the pre-disaster state. Using the beta distribution, the recovery behavior of economic sectors was modeled through a spectrum of trajectories that reflect percentiles.",
