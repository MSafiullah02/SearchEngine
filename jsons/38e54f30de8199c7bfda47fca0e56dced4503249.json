            "text": "The term \"healthcare-associated infections\" (HCAIs) is commonly used to refer to the whole spectrum of infections that a patient acquires from the healthcare environment including hospitals, intensive care units, hospice, nursing homes, etc. Nosocomial infections or hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as \"those infections that were not present in carrier state or incubating state at the time of admission and manifest 48 h after hospital admission\" [24] . These infections are often unrelated to the primary cause of hospital admission and can present even after the hospital discharge of the patients [42] . As per the CDC criteria for surveillance, nosocomial infection sites can be of 9 types affecting over 35 infection sites that can be differentiated on the basis of microbiological and clinical criteria [11] . Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) are more vulnerable to nosocomial infections. The Extended Prevalence of Infection in Intensive Care (EPIC II) study showed a prevalence of infections within the ICU as high as 51% [82] . Nosocomial infections are associated with worse outcomes including increased length of hospital stay, long-term disability, and increased mortality rate, and are associated with increased antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance [42] . Due to the multiple risk factors like immunosuppression, disrupted skin and mucosal barriers, recurrent hospital visits, exposure to multiple antibiotics, and the presence of invasive lines and other devices, cancer patients, irrespective of whether they have solid or hematologic malignancies, are at high risk for nosocomial infections [20] . As cancer patients are increasingly being admitted to ICUs for management of diseaseand treatment-related complications, the incidence of nosocomial infections is also increasing in ICUs caring for cancer patients [5] . The common nosocomial infections are catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), surgical site infections (SSI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). This chapter will focus on VAP, CAUTI, and SSI, and central line-related bloodstream infection will be dealt with separately.",

These agents may be commensals in the patient or may originate from an exogenous source and spread via cross infection. Hospital-acquired pathogens are often resistant to most antibiotics (multidrug resistant) or at times extremely drug resistant or pan drug resistant, thereby increasing the treatment costs, antibiotic use, and antibiotic resistance. This is evident from microbiology data demonstrating an increasing incidence of nosocomial infections that are caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria over the years [19, 86] . The common pathogens are gram-negative bacteria including Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and Acinetobacter and gram-positive bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), coagulase-negative Staphylococci, and Enterococci. Invasive candidal infections also occur in those with indwelling catheters, lines or contaminated abdominal surgeries [66] . The other common nosocomial organisms are Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, anaerobes, and Enterobacter.",

The infection control committee should be entrusted with the responsibility of formulating and implementing \"care bundles\" for common nosocomial infections that can be adopted from health organizations like CDC, WHO, etc. and modified as per hospital policy. Across the world, implementation of such \"bundles of care\" and adherence to these bundles have been proven to significantly reduce nosocomial infections, especially in the developing countries [1, 69] . The infection control team should conduct audits and give necessary feedback regarding compliance with hand-washing and other infection control policies. [55] . An Antibiotic Stewardship Program should be initiated with a multidisciplinary team, with members such as an infectious disease specialist, a clinical pharmacist with training in infectious disease, a clinical microbiologist, an information system specialist, and an epidemiologist, with a policy for regulating higher antibiotic prescription. Review of practice of antibiotic prescription, ensuring environmental decontamination with surface cleaning, air filtration and decontamination of water source, increasing strength of healthcare personnel (improving nurse to patient ratio and increasing waste management staff), and regular training and feedback to hospital staff are some important measures that can be adopted at an institutional level for reducing the nosocomial infections inside the hospital. The treatment of common nosocomial infections and bundle of cares will be discussed under respective sections in the chapter.",

The terminology \"healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP)\" was introduced by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in 2005 for patients in the community to be considered at high risk for MDR pathogens similar to those associated with HAP. These patients, in spite of not being hospitalized, were still considered as high risk in virtue of their interaction with the healthcare system. Over years, increasing evidence suggested that this could be a false assumption that also led to inappropriate use of antibiotics [15, 37] . Probably this group of patients needs to be considered as a high-risk group when they present to the emergency department with communityacquired pneumonia. Hence the current guidelines do not consider HCAP as a part of HAP [40, 78] . The current IDSA guidelines recommend the use of two mutually exclusive termsventilator-associated pneumonia and hospitalacquired pneumoniathereby avoiding the terminology of \"non-ventilator-associated hospital-acquired pneumonia.\" The terminology has been explained in Fig. 1 .",

The risk of VAP is highest during the initial days of ventilation (3% per day), which gradually decreases over time (2% per day from fifth to tenth day and 1% afterward). Older data suggested that most of the VAP episodes occurred in the initial part of ICU stay itself (early VAP) probably because of the increased practices of short-term ventilation in majority of patients [27] .

The normal cough reflex is hampered by the endotracheal tube, and these pathogens gain access to the lower respiratory tract through micro-aspiration along the endotracheal cuff, aided by the ventilator gas flow. The stomach is an important source of bacterial colonization. Change in the acidic pH of the stomach due to drugs favors colonization with these virulent bacteria, and with regurgitation of gastric contents, they pool in the oropharynx and reach the lower respiratory tract by micro-aspirations. The risks are further increased in the absence of adequate cuff seal or with multiple attempts of intubation. These virulent bacteria are usually difficult to treat owing to the thick biofilm that they produce alongside the endotracheal tube. The presence of this biofilm hampers antibiotic penetration and increases antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance [31, 39] .",

The duration of hospital stays before intubation, length of ICU stays, and duration of ventilation are also significant as they determine the nature of flora causing VAP (see Table 3 ). VAP before 4 days (early-onset VAP) is often caused by microbes similar to the organisms causing community-acquired pneumonia like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), and susceptible Enterobacteriaceae [50] . Late-onset VAP is usually caused by microbes from the hospital environment. They are usually the aerobic gramnegative bacilli like Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, and E. coli, while MRSA is rarely implicated [50] . The odds that they are multidrug resistant is high, and hence these infections are more difficult to treat. This difference between early and late VAP may not always be clinically relevant, and there are increasing reports of lack of difference in microbiology and mortality across both groups [21, 26] . Patients who are previously exposed to healthcare environment such as those who received antibiotics within the preceding 3 months, those who are currently hospitalized for more than 5 days, those who are on immunosuppressants, or those who have immunosuppressive states such as chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, AIDS, etc. are prone to multidrugresistant infections irrespective of the onset of VAP.

These signs are highly nonspecific and may be also associated with various noninfectious causes. Moreover, the sensitivity and specificity of routine ICU X-rays is much lower than the conventional X-rays. Interobserver variability in interpreting X-ray findings also affects their accuracy as a diagnostic tool. Hence the diagnosis of VAP in ICU lacks sensitivity and specificity and may result in both over diagnosis or underdiagnosis. However, if the clinical suspicion of pneumonia is high, empiric antibiotics should be administered immediately as delay in antimicrobial treatment leads to increased mortality [38, 49] .",

The CPIS (Table 4) consists of six clinical and laboratory parameters with scores range from 0 to 12. A score 6 has a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 85%, for the presence of VAP [60, 89] . Although seemingly simple and straightforward, calculation of CPIS score also varies substantially from observer to observer, hereby limiting its routine use in clinical trials [89] . The current IDSA guidelines suggest the use of clinical criteria rather than CPIS score for initiating and stopping of antibiotics [40] .",

Bronchoscopic techniques like BAL, mini-BAL, and protected specimen brush (PSB) specimens provide reliable lower respiratory tract samples, and quantitative cultures of these samples may help to differentiate colonization from true infections. Technically it has the advantage of identifying the pathogens correctly, leading to less antibiotic exposure and thereby minimizing antibiotic resistance. However, bronchoscopy and sample collection require expertise and still result in false negative reports. Blind sampling requires less expertise and infrastructure and is easy to perform. However, blind sampling is likely to produce false positive results with colonizing organisms, thereby increasing inappropriate antibiotic use and promoting antibiotic resistance. The available data remains conflicting with no benefits of one method over the other with respect to mortality, length of ICU stay, and mechanical ventilation days [10, 75] . The IDSA recommends blind methods of sample collection, while the European guidelines recommend bronchoscopicdirected methods [40, 78] . The threshold values for cultured specimens recommended by CDC for the diagnosis of pneumonia are mentioned in Table 5 .",

Procalcitonin, a precursor hormone of calcitonin, is actively produced by neuroendocrine cells in the lung and intestine on exposure to bacterial endotoxin and inflammatory cytokines. The level peaks at 6 h and may aid in early identification of infections as compared to blood culture. Procalcitonin is not useful in cases of viral or fungal infections and in cases of localized bacterial infections. It is also elevated in noninfectious conditions such as burns, major surgery, end-stage renal failure, etc. [84] . Procalcitonin testing is expensive and serial measurements make it even more expensive. Based on the current data, procalcitonin levels should not be used to rule out an infection or influence the decision of antibiotic initiation. The main role of procalcitonin is in its role as a guide for early stoppage of antibiotics, thereby preventing unwanted exposure to antibiotics [9, 84] . The current guidelines do not recommend the use of these biomarkers over clinical criteria for a diagnosis of VAP [40, 78] .",

In patients without risk factors for gram-negative MDR infection, such as those without any structural lung disease or those who have not received antibiotics in recent past, a single antipseudomonal agent that also covers MSSA will be appropriate. Only in patients with underlying structural lung disease like bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis or those having higher risk for MDR infection, dual antipseudomonal coverage should be given [40] . Recommended empirical antibiotics are those with antipseudomonal and MSSA activity such as ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillintazobactam, fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin, carbapenems such as meropenem or imipenem, etc. Aminoglycosides are not recommended as monotherapy for VAP. In case MRSA is suspected, linezolid or vancomycin may be used. With the increased incidence of infections due to MDR gram-negative pathogens, there has been a resurgence of polymyxins in the treatment of VAP. They may be particularly useful in places with increased baseline MDR Acinetobacter rates [40] and for empiric therapy in patients with septic shock or high risk such as neutropenic patients or those who have hypersensitivity to beta-lactams. Current evidence suggests that different doses or dosage schedules might be required for various bacteria, depending on the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters [28] . The IDSA guidelines recommend the addition of nebulized colistin along with intravenous route for managing VAP [40] . Regarding newer antibiotics, daptomycin is inactivated in the lungs and hence is not recommended for VAP. Tigecycline monotherapy in the doses as per the label is not recommended for HAP or VAP [40, 78] . Doxycycline and fosfomycin have not been studied for hospital-acquired MRSA as standalone treatments [64, 73] . Antibiotics should be changed according to culture and sensitivity reports and may be administered for a total duration of 7 days, or fewer, perhaps guided by procalcitonin levels. The European guidelines for VAP recommend a total treatment duration of 7-8 days for all immunocompetent hosts in the absence of complications such as empyema, lung abscess, or necrotizing pneumonia, if initial empiric therapy was adequate and their response to treatment has been good irrespective of the microbiological etiology. Patients infected with Pseudomonas, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, and Acinetobacter, those on antibiotics such as tigecycline and colistin, and immunocompromised hosts will require a prolonged duration of treatment [78] .",

While addressing nosocomial pneumonia including HAP and VAP, both guidelines concur with each other except for a few points. The ATS guidelines do not make any new recommendations regarding VAP prevention and encourage the use of clinical criteria to decide on initiation and discontinuation of antibiotics rather than use of Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) score. The ATS guidelines recommend the usage of noninvasive or minimally invasive techniques for microbiological investigations of VAP. Risk factors for MDR pathogens are described by ATS as prior hospitalization and organ failure such as septic shock ARDS and requirement of dialysis prior to VAP onset. They recommend combination therapy for target therapy and set a duration of treatment for HAP and VAP as 7 days. The European guidelines mention prevention strategies for VAP but do not make any recommendation on the use of chlorhexidine for selective oropharyngeal decontamination. The European guidelines introduce the concept of \"low probability of HAP\" and suggest the usage of CPIS score to identify the same. They endorse invasive sampling over noninvasive sampling, as it might help to avoid overdiagnosis and unnecessary antibiotic exposure. The risk of MDR pathogens is described based upon local prevalence rates of MDR organisms and presence of septic shock. Although they recommend 7 days of treatment, they suggested prolonged treatment for selected patients. Both guidelines agree on the need of appropriate empiric antibiotic treatment, the need for de-escalation, and the need to minimize antibiotic exposure [40, 54, 78, 79] .",

The lack of improvement in clinical condition and/or clinical parameters such as fever, tachypnea, oxygenation, etc. after initiation of treatment can be either due to poor response to treatment/persistence of infection or due to a secondary infection. Typically, non-resolving pneumonia is common in elderly patients or in those with comorbidities, underlying immunosuppression, chronic lung disease, or infection with virulent/drug resistant pathogen. Treatment factors such as inappropriate initial therapy (either drug or its dose, route, frequency, and duration) are other important factors responsible for VAP. Workup for non-resolving pneumonia should be undertaken, including microbiological workup for MDR pathogens and imaging for complications such as lung abscess or empyema, while ruling out noninfectious causes of fever and radiologic infiltrates. Once an infective etiology is confirmed, optimizing antibiotics as per the pk/pd principles with a hike in antimicrobial coverage will be needed to manage non-resolving pneumonia [51] .",
