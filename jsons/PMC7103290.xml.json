            "text": "Codon usage bias is one of the most important indicators of the selective forces that shape genome evolution. In general, codon usage bias may be a result of mutation pressure and/or relative abundance of the corresponding acceptor tRNA molecules. For human RNA viruses, it has been observed in one study that codon usage bias was related to mutation pressure, G + C content, segmented nature of the genome and the route of transmission of the virus (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003). In other studies, it has been suggested that mutation pressure may result in bias in dinucleotide usage, such as CpG suppression, in small eukaryotic viruses (Karlin et al., 1994, Shackelton et al., 2006). Other factors, such as cytosine deamination, which results in C \u2192 U changes, have also been proposed to be responsible for shaping the G + C contents and GC skews of RNA viruses (Pyrc et al., 2004). Recently, it has been observed that codon usage is an important driving force in the evolution of astroviruses and small DNA viruses (Sewatanon et al., 2007, Van Hemert et al., 2007). Despite all these fragmented observations, no study has integrated the various factors and been able to explain the basis for codon usage bias in viruses successfully.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are positive sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses found in a wide range of animals in which they can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological diseases of varying severity. The sizes of the genomes of coronaviruses are about 30 kb, the largest among RNA viruses. Based on genotypic and serological characterization, coronaviruses were divided into three distinct groups (Brian and Baric, 2005, Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, Ziebuhr, 2004). As a result of the low fidelity of the RNA-dependent\u2013RNA polymerases, the mutation rates of RNA virus genomes are high, in the order of 1 per 10,000 nucleotides replicated. Furthermore, the unique mechanism of viral replication has resulted in a high frequency of recombination in coronaviruses (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, Woo et al., 2006b). Their tendency for recombination and high mutation rates have made their genomes highly plastic, allowed them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches, and given them the potential to be good candidates for causing pandemics. These factors have made the study of coronavirus evolution particularly important, both biologically and for practical purposes (Grigoriev, 2004, Gu et al., 2004, Yap et al., 2003). However, the relative importance of the various selective forces that shape the codon usage bias in coronaviruses and their underlying biological and biochemical basis are still poorly understood.",

For human coronaviruses, in 2004, a novel group 1 human coronavirus, human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), was reported (Fouchier et al., 2004, Van der Hoek et al., 2004); and in 2005, we described the discovery, complete genome sequence and molecular diversity of another novel group 2 human coronavirus, coronavirus HKU1 (CoV-HKU1) (Lau et al., 2006, Woo et al., 2005a, Woo et al., 2005b, Woo et al., 2005c, Woo et al., 2006b). As for animal coronaviruses, six group 1 (Poon et al., 2005, Tang et al., 2006, Woo et al., 2006a, Lau et al., 2007), six group 2, including bat SARS coronavirus, sable antelope coronavirus, giraffe coronavirus, and two new subgroups of group 2 coronaviruses (Lau et al., 2005, Li et al., 2005, Woo et al., 2006a, Woo et al., 2007), 11 group 3 (Cavanagh et al., 2002, East et al., 2004, Jonassen et al., 2005, Liu et al., 2005, Hasoksuz et al., 2007) coronaviruses, and two unclassified coronaviruses from Asian leopard cats and Chinese ferret badgers (Dong et al., 2007) have recently been described. Since the number of coronavirus species with complete genomes available has increased from 9 in 2003 to 19 in 2007, this has provided a golden opportunity to study genome evolution in coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Marked CpG suppression is observed in all coronavirus genomes. The discovery of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and the downstream molecular pathways was one of the biggest advances in the understanding of vertebrate innate immunity in recent years. Among the TLR that recognize viral components, TLR3, 7, 8 and 9 detect viral nucleic acids (Bowie and Haga, 2005). It has been shown that TLR9 bound to CpG of double-stranded DNA and elicited the downstream inflammatory response, and administration of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides has been shown to protect mice from herpes simplex virus 2 infections (Ashkar et al., 2003, Lund et al., 2003). Furthermore, it has been shown that CpG is under-represented in the genomes of small DNA viruses, which could be related to their evasion of the host immune systems (Karlin et al., 1994, Shackelton et al., 2006). Although CpG suppression was also observed in RNA viruses, no known TLR has been shown to recognize CpG of ssRNA. However, recently it has been shown that ssRNA can stimulate human CD14+CD11c+ monocytes to produce large amounts of interleukin 12, but this activation of monocytes by CpG oligoribonucleotides was not mediated through TLR3, 7, 8 or 9 (Sugiyama et al., 2005). The results suggested that CpG oligoribonucleotides may stimulate monocytes through a novel mechanism distinct from previously known immunostimulatory nucleic acids. In the present study, we showed that the mean CpG relative abundance in the coronavirus genomes is markedly suppressed (Table 4). This concurs with the results observed in a study on di- and trinucleotide frequencies in nine coronaviruses 10 years ago (Tobler and Ackermann, 1998). The most logical way to avoid CpG is to mutate them to either UpG or CpA. This is in line with the observation that these two dinucleotides are over-represented in the coronavirus genomes, but their deviations from the upper limit of the \u201cnormal range\u201d is not as remarkable as that of CpG from the lower limit of the \u201cnormal range\u201d, as the CpG suppression pressure is equally shared by UpG and CpA over-representation. Interestingly, only CpG containing codons in the context of purine-CpG (ACG and GCG), pyrimidine-CpG (UCG and CCG) and CpG-purine (CGA and CGG) are suppressed (Table 2), whereas CpG-pyrimidine (CGU and CGC) are not. However, when trinucleotide frequencies were analyzed in the 19 coronavirus genomes, all the eight trinucleotides with CpG were suppressed (Fig. 2\n). This indicates that there is probably another force that has led to an increase use of CGU and CGC as codons for arginine, but this force does not act on trinucleotides over the whole genome in general. This force is probably unrelated to the relative abundance of the corresponding tRNA molecules in the hosts of the coronaviruses, as the pattern of bias in the hosts is not the same as that in the coronaviruses.",

            "text": "In addition to CpG suppression, marked cytosine deamination is also observed in all coronavirus genomes. Although it has been recognized that deamination of cytosine is a significant source of spontaneous mutations for a few decades (Duncan and Miller, 1980), DNA-cytosine deaminases, which are able to attack cytosines in single-stranded DNA, have only been discovered in the recent few years (Bransteitter et al., 2003, Sohail et al., 2003). The discovery of the ability to edit human immunodeficiency virus DNA, and subsequently RNA as well, by the human cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G has allowed the speculation that APOBEC-mediated cytosine deamination may contribute to the sequence variation of RNA viruses that replicate without any DNA intermediates (Bishop et al., 2004). GC skew, which reflects cytosine deamination, has been studied in various coronaviruses, and it has been shown that the GC skews of coronavirus genomes become less pronounced in the one third of the genome that encodes the structural proteins (Grigoriev, 2004, Pyrc et al., 2004). In the present study, using the six amino acids that are only encoded by NNU or NNC, hence excluding most other pressures that may affect the relative abundance of cytosine and uracil, we showed that all these NNU and NNC had usage fractions of > 0.700 and < 0.300, respectively (Table 2). In fact, for all codons that encode the same amino acid and with either C or U in any position, the usage fraction of the codon that uses U is invariably higher than the one that uses C in all coronaviruses. Furthermore, the percentage of C showed strong inverse relationships with the percentage of U in coronavirus genomes (r\n = \u2212 0.902, P\n < 0.0001) (Fig. 3\n). All these suggest that cytosine deamination is an important biochemical force in shaping coronavirus evolution.",

            "text": "Cytosine deamination and selection of CpG suppressed clones by the immune system are the two major independent biochemical and biological selective forces that shape codon usage bias in coronavirus genomes. Codon usage bias in coronaviruses is unrelated to the relative abundance of the corresponding tRNA molecules, as the patterns of bias in codon usage fractions in the hosts are not the same as those in the coronaviruses (Table 2, Table 3). Although others have tried to explain variations in codon usage in coronaviruses by compositional constraints (Gu et al., 2004), we think that both codon usage bias and nucleotide composition of the coronavirus genomes, which are apparently related to each other, are both results of other biological and biochemical selective forces, rather than nucleotide composition as a cause of codon usage bias. On the other hand, most of the codon usage bias in the coronaviruses can be easily explained by CpG suppression and cytosine deamination (Table 2). For asparagine, isoleucine, histidine, aspartic acid, glycine, valine, tyrosine, cysteine and phenylalanine, NNU are used more frequently than NNC because of cytosine deamination. For lysine, glutamine and glutamic acid, NNA are used slightly more frequently than NNG because of cytosine deamination in the minus strand during RNA replication. For threonine, ACG is suppressed because of CpG suppression and ACU is used more frequently than ACC because of cytosine deamination. For arginine, CGA and CGG are suppressed because of CpG suppression and CGU is used more frequently than CGC because of cytosine deamination. AGA is used more frequently than AGG and CGA is used more frequently than CGG because of cytosine deamination in the minus strand during RNA replication. For proline, CCG is suppressed because of CpG suppression and CCU is used more frequently than CCC because of cytosine deamination. For leucine, CUU is used more frequently than CUC, UUA is used more frequently than CUA, and UUG is used more frequently than CUG because of cytosine deamination. For alanine, GCG is suppressed because of CpG suppression and GCU is used more frequently than GCC because of cytosine deamination. For serine, UCG is suppressed because of CpG suppression and UCU is used more frequently than UCC while ACU is used more frequently than ACC because of cytosine deamination. In addition to showing that CpG suppression and cytosine deamination are probably the two most important biological/biochemical forces that shape codon usage bias, we also demonstrated that these two forces are independent (Fig. 1), although cytosine deamination and subsequent selection of CpG suppressed clones by the immune system may be one of the mechanisms that has led to the resultant CpG suppression. Furthermore, we speculate that the species-specific number of CpG containing codons may not simply be the result of mutation pressure to avoid CpG, but an equilibrium between the immune pressure and the required number of CpG containing codons to serve biological functions such as to maintain RNA structure stability. Such an additional factor could explain the mere correlation between the NNU/NNC ratio and CpG dinucleotide abundance.",

The contribution of cytosine deamination to genome evolution varies from very low to very high among the 19 coronavirus genomes. For bat-CoV HKU5, SARS-CoV and bat-SARS-CoV, the mean NNU/NNC ratios are less than 1.7 (Fig. 1). Codon usage bias in these coronaviruses is relatively mild (Nc of 53.23, 49.423 and 49.882, respectively; Table 1), and is mainly due to CpG suppression (Table 2). On the other hand, for CoV-HKU1, the mean NNU/NNC ratio is more than 8.8 (Fig. 1), which is likely a result of rapid cytosine deamination. Although the biochemical basis for this extreme cytosine deamination is not known, this is probably the explanation for the extremely strong codon usage bias in CoV-HKU1 (Nc of 35.671) and its lowest G + C content of 32% among all coronavirus genomes (Table 1).",
