This study is important in helping to define the virologic characteristics and clinical epidemiology of AAV, a virus that is increasingly being used as a delivery mechanism for gene therapies and newergeneration vaccines. AAV has been an attractive candidate for use as a viral vector, stemming from its ability to infect diverse human cell lines, the specificity of its integration into the host genome, and its presumed nonpathogenicity. However, little work has been done to evaluate the clinical epidemiology associated with wild-type AAV, and this virus has not been previously studied in highly immunocompromised patients. Although studies of wild-type AAV have historically focused on the serologic identification of prior or latent infection in hospitalized patients [12, 13] , we used molecular diagnostic techniques to demonstrate instances of acute AAV viremia in a cohort of immunocompromised HCT recipients.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 999, "end": 1003, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1007, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although 2 patients died of pulmonary complications in proximity to their viremia (both ,7 weeks), AAV was not detected in BAL or lung tissue specimens (or other tissue specimens) from either patient.

However, the number of cases is small, and it is unknown whether AAV itself would cause histologic changes in human tissue and whether histopathologic changes, if they occurred, would be those of the helper virus. Overall, the deaths are plausibly explained by Aspergillus pneumonia (case 1) and idiopathic pneumonia syndrome with leukemic relapse (case 3).
