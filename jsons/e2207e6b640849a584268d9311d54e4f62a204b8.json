However, pre-anaesthetic screening of overtly healthy patients is commonly recommended in small animal practice and sometimes presented as a necessary part of good patient care. Although these tests may uncover abnormalities, they have often not been found to alter the anaesthetic plan or affect the complication rate.

Testing to ease our anxieties or because of concerns about being sued is not appropriate for a professional aiming to provide best care.

So, while other countries are investing in measures to contain and limit the effects of the CyHV-3 virus, Australia is looking at the possibility of voluntary release of this virus.

This would coincide with the spring breeding season, but also the time of greatest use of water bodies for boating, fishing and tourism. It would seem unlikely that viral release would be permitted during this optimal time.

Death results from inflammation and necrosis involving any of a number of organs including the brain, gills, skin, intestines, kidney, spleen and liver. The prolonged disease course means that fish become prone to secondary bacterial or parasitic infections prior to death.

When linked to meteorology much has become understandable about this vital site for the study and entry of arboviruses infecting cattle. As more and more arboviruses are found, the picture has become clearer, with a wealth of past data to assist on meteorology, seasonality affecting vectors etc. I hope you can visit Coastal Plains Research Station, with your camera, and see the results of similar pacification of the cattle herd there. The environment is very different but the research is very productive. It was a great adventure at the time.
