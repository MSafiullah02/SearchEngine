Other common viral infections such as parvovirus B19, rubella, measles, Epstein-Barr, human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) and enterovirus that might cause fever and rash were ruled out by laboratory investigation. A chest X-Ray did not reveal lung abnormalities. As the patient had no risk factor and following the Spanish Guidelines, he did not receive any specific treatment for the infection. The patient remained afebrile during the next week. Cutaneous rash solved in 7 days. The patient just received oral antihistamine due to mild pruritus. The key aspect in this COVID-19 epidemic is to prevent transmission. This may pose a challenge in asymptomatic patients and in those with atypical symptoms. All professionals should recognize the possibility that a patient might have only a skin rash and think of this disease to promptly prevent transmission.",
