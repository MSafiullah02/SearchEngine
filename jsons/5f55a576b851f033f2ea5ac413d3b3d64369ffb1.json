We found that dyspnea, an easily assessed symptom, is associated with death in patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia independently of age and sex. However, a related and also easily acquired clinical measure, oxygen saturation \u2264 90% despite oxygen supplementation, provides a more robust risk factor for fatal outcomes -indeed this measure is the most powerful predictor of the multiple measures we obtained, including the more standard demographic and inflammatory measures reported in earlier studies. 5, 10 Our findings of important prognostic value of dyspnea and hypoxemia for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia provide a rationale for applying standard scoring strategies to estimate risk and guide treatment even in this patient population, i.e., Scale, the Pneumonia Severity Index, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II. 11 Future studies assessing the prognostic significance of such models in COVID-19 associated pneumonia are needed.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1048, "end": 1050, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1051, "end": 1053, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1414, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "It is important to note that exploratory subgroup analysis on patients 80 years and older, in whom mortality is known to be especially high (69.2% in our study), revealed that all of patients with oxygen saturation above 90% (n = 3) survived.

For example while oxygen supplementation at admission was administered with the goal of achieving SpO 2 \u226595%, the specific amount of oxygen supplementation administered to each patient upon admission was not recorded. Therefore we cannot incorporate comparisons of administered inspired oxygen concentration into our analyses.
