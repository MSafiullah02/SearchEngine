As of April 22, 2020, there have been 2 471 136 confirmed cases worldwide, with 169 006 deaths;1 82 798 confirmed cases and 4632 deaths have been reported in mainland China.2 The rapidly evolving epidemic has stressed the entire Chinese health-care system, especially in Wuhan, Hubei province. When fever clinics and respiratory and infectious disease units in Wuhan were overwhelmed by the increasing number of suspected and confirmed cases in the early stages of the outbreak, general wards were quickly modified into isolation wards, and health-care providers who did not have infectious disease expertise stepped up to provide care for patients with COVID-19. As the epidemic progressed in Hubei province, more local health-care providers joined the epidemic control efforts, and 42 000 health-care providers (including 28 600 nurses) from across China came to Hubei to support them.3\n",

Their health and safety are crucial not only for continuous and safe patient care, but also for control of any outbreak.4 However, health-care providers caring for patients during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks were under extraordinary stress related to high risk of infection, stigmatisation, understaffing, and uncertainty, and comprehensive support was a high priority during the outbreaks and afterwards.5, 6 Quantitative studies have shown that frontline health-care providers treating patients with COVID-19 have greater risks of mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and stress.7 Frontline physicians and nurses who had no infectious disease expertise had additional challenges when they adjusted to an entirely new working environment in this stressful situation. To our knowledge, no qualitative studies of the experiences of these health-care providers have been published. To support them effectively, it is necessary to gain insights into their lived experience.",

We also searched Wanfang Data using the same terms in Chinese. We found several online comments calling for mental health care and infection prevention for health-care providers. There were no research articles on the health-care providers' experiences early in the COVID-19 crisis, when little was known.\nAdded value of this study\nWe used an adaptation of Colaizzi's empirical phenomenological research approach to obtain an in-depth understanding of health-care providers' experiences of caring for patients with COVID-19. Health-care providers showed a tremendous sense of responsibility and concerted efforts in alleviating patients' suffering, including working in a totally new context, physical exhaustion due to heavy workloads and protective gear, the fear of becoming infected and infecting others, and feeling powerless to handle patients' conditions. To cope with stressful situations, they identified many sources of social support and used self-management strategies. They also described how they were able to transcend the difficulties inherent in their unique experience.\nImplications of all the available evidence\nComprehensive support is needed for frontline health-care providers, including sufficient personal protective equipment, reasonable work schedules, effective communication, monitoring and supervision of infection control, and professional psychological support. Intensive training is necessary for health-care providers without infectious disease expertise.\n",

Infection among health-care workers has been a problem during other outbreaks. During the SARS epidemic, nurses' higher levels of trust in equipment or infection control initiatives were related to lower levels of emotional exhaustion and state anger.19 Workforce safety is a high priority. To help health-care providers reduce uncertainty and fear, in addition to improving knowledge of infection prevention and control and personal protection skills, hospitals need to provide a safe working environment and sufficient protective supplies and have personnel responsible for continuous training, monitoring, and supervision of infection prevention and control. Sound infection prevention practices are also needed in the living quarters of medical teams from other provinces. For frontline health-care providers who lived at home, the concerns about transmitting the virus to family members need to be addressed. Supportive conversations and recommendations, such as separation of living spaces, changing clothing, and immediately showering after duty, might help to reduce anxiety.14\n",
