Traditionally, tracheostomy is performed to ease weaning from ventilator support, to facilitate airway suctioning and clearance of secretions, to improve patient comfort and mobility, and to prevent long-term complications, including tracheal stenosis. However, in COVID-19, the disseminated interstitial pneumonia has instead been found to either progress or resolve within a short time frame, obviating the purported benefits of tracheostomy. Current intensive care protocols have a low incidence of stenosis that is not substantially higher than the approximate 2% to 3% airway stenosis associated with tracheostomy; there has also not been a proven mortality benefit of tracheostomy in severely ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).3-5 Additionally, the pace of respiratory failure from coronavirus disease is quite swift among those patients who are severely affected. A report of 21 critically ill patients from Washington State reported 67% of the patients dying within the 12- to 26-day period reported.6 In Wuhan, China, 67% of 201 patients who required intubation ultimately died.7 Given the rapid decline of those affected with widespread inflammation in the lungs, tracheostomy provides no medical benefit. We therefore do not foresee widespread indication for tracheostomy due to prolonged intubation in patients with COVID-19.",

Data from SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome)\u2014another severe respiratory illness caused by a genetically similar coronavirus\u2014include reported transmission to 9 health care workers during a single difficult airway case, despite using N95 mask, face shields, gloves, and gowns.8 One patient undergoing tracheostomy would encounter, at a minimum, 3 persons in the operation and 14 shifts of nurses and respiratory therapists during 1 week of postoperative care. Tracheal secretions are highly aerosolized during coughing and suctioning and thus are expected to spread far from the patient source and remain suspended in air for up to 3 hours.9 The ongoing transmission risk to health care workers is thus substantially higher than other procedures, such as intubation, which results in more temporally limited respiratory trauma and viral shedding. In most cases, the risk of disease transmission from tracheostomy outweighs any potential patient benefit.",

Many of these patients do require intubation, sometimes under difficult circumstances, and one can expect that airway loss will occasionally occur. For patients with difficult intubation, alternative options for securing the airway with the least amount of exposure and respiratory mucosal trauma should be attempted first. So far, evidence shows that viral load is high in the nasal cavity, and anecdotal evidence from international experiences has suggested that endonasal procedures pose one of the highest risks for viral transmission.10 Therefore, avoidance of nasal instrumentation, including nasotracheal intubation and nasal trumpets, should be considered in patients who are COVID-19 positive. Conversely, a laryngeal mask airway should be considered as a preferred method to secure the airway in such patients rather than as an emergent surgical airway procedure. An intubating laryngeal mask airway can later be converted to an endotracheal tube under bronchoscopic guidance. This procedure does pose transmission risk at the time of performance but should produce less ongoing viral aerosolization throughout the postprocedure period.",

In the event that the airway is lost, the time for the surgical team to arrive and don the proper PPE may take a prolonged period and lead to increased risk of exposure and poor patient outcomes. However, a cricothyrotomy can temporize the airway in the emergency setting and later be converted and formalized into a tracheostomy as indicated. If tracheostomy is unavoidable in an intubated patient and the procedure is not emergent, percutaneous tracheostomy in the ICU should be highly considered for patients who are COVID positive. This procedure has decreased open respiratory epithelial trauma; it takes less time; and it decreases exposure to operating room personnel. It is important to remember that bronchoscopy is also a high-risk aerosolizing procedure; thus, it should be performed by the most experienced clinician available and with the same personal protective measures as surgical tracheostomy.11 If it is suspected that bronchoscopy will be complicated or lead to increased exposure (eg, in patients who would normally not be recommended for percutaneous tracheostomy due to body habitus), then a discussion of the risks and benefits to open tracheostomy must be had among the senior-most physicians with consideration for patient and provider safety.",

Many persons will have unknown COVID status due to a lack of testing capability or lack of suspicious symptoms. In the setting of a true airway emergency, there may be inadequate time for testing. Such patients must be presumed to be COVID positive, with proper PPE and isolation undertaken if emergent tracheostomy is required. If tracheostomy is elective (defined as not imminently life-saving), it is highly recommended that the procedure be delayed until COVID testing can be performed. This includes patients who have cancer and for whom a tracheostomy is a requisite component of cancer resection. In addition to the risk to health care workers, there is certainly elevated risk to patients undergoing elective surgery during the prodromal phase of coronavirus disease. While RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) COVID testing is preferred and considered first-line, computed tomography chest imaging has been shown to have a high percentage of initial positive findings consistent with COVID-19 prior to, or in parallel with, RT-PCR results.13 This may provide a supplement or adjunct to COVID testing, which can add to our clinical suspicion and further inform clinical decision making in urgent or time-sensitive cases.",

As a result, preoperative COVID-19 testing is highly recommended prior to tracheostomy if time permissible. If not able to be performed preoperatively, testing is still advisable postoperatively and would be helpful to conserve PPE required during routine trach care. As stated earlier, patients whose COVID status is unknown should be presumed to be COVID positive, out of an abundance of caution, and maximal PPE should be employed. In patients who are COVID positive, enhanced droplet-precaution PPE is required for all patient interactions. Aerosol-generating procedures, such as tracheostomy suctioning, additionally require powered air-purifying respirator. Suctioning should be performed with a closed suction system and an in-line viral filter. During the postoperative period, it is preferable to keep the cuff inflated and delay changing the tracheostomy tube until either COVID status can be determined or the infectious period has passed. This period has been reported as 14 days, but it may change as more information becomes available. In patients who are COVID negative, standard PPE, including surgical mask, face shield, gown, and gloves, should be utilized during tracheostomy care.",

These patients may go to an acute care or rehabilitation facility, a skilled nursing facility, or a family home with the assistance of home health services. Since tracheotomy care results in extensive aerosolization and exposure for anyone who comes into such contact, patients present a high risk for viral shedding if COVID positive. For those going to a facility, this could result in exposure and transmission to a very fragile and high-risk community. Therefore, it would be advisable to consider COVID testing for all patients with tracheostomy prior to discharge. In the event that COVID testing is positive, consideration may be given to delay discharge until the patient has recovered and developed antibodies.",
