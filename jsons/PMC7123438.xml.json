            "text": "During the 2014\u20132016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, over 850 healthcare workers contracted Ebola, and over 500 died [1]. These tragic numbers underscore the need for strict adherence to infection control precautions when caring for patients with Ebola and other diseases that are both highly infectious and potentially fatal. In addition to the use of personal protection equipment (PPE), such measures include source isolation of infected patients. In the process of confining infectious pathogens, however, it is essential that health systems do not overlook the psychological needs of patients nor that of the medical staff who care for them. This chapter is divided into two sections. The first explores the experiences of patients cared for in source isolation, highlighting the possible iatrogenic psychological consequences of treatment on a biocontainment unit. Strategies for mitigating the potentially harmful psychological effects of isolation are reviewed, including considerations for children. The second section considers the experiences of healthcare workers. The discussion outlines the psychological impact of treating infectious diseases, risk factors for emotional distress, and strategies to promote psychological well-being and resilience.",

Beyond these sources of stress, however, patients treated in dedicated isolation rooms face a variety of unique challenges, including confinement in a small space, reduced opportunities for interaction with others, and potential stigmatization. Indeed, while source isolation is an essential strategy for minimizing risk to healthcare workers as well as the broader community, research conducted over the past two decades suggests that infection control precautions involving isolation may have negative psychological consequences for patients. Compared to hospitalized patients who are not isolated, for example, patients treated in isolation for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) and Clostridium difficile are at increased risk for symptoms of depression and anxiety [3\u20137]. The data suggest that symptoms are likely to emerge after 2\u20133 days of isolation and may intensify with increased length of treatment [3, 4, 6\u201310]. Of course, beyond the effects of isolation, patients with life-threatening infectious diseases such as Ebola are at risk for significant emotional distress due to the traumatic nature of the symptoms themselves, the prospect of dying, and having witnessed or cared for others who died from the disease [11].",

            "text": "One factor that may contribute to the negative psychological impact of isolation is the loss of control associated with confinement in a small space for an indeterminate length of time [4, 13, 19, 23, 27, 28]. Beyond restriction to their rooms, patients in isolation typically have little say regarding who enters the room, when they can be alone, what food is available, and which clothes they can wear. In addition, curtailment in meaningful activities, including opportunities for socialization with friends, family, and other patients, may play a role in the harmful psychological consequences of isolation [13, 16\u201318, 22]. More generally, diminished sensory stimuli, including a limited view of the rest of the hospital unit [29, 30] and reduced visual contact with others [13], might also contribute to the adverse effects of treatment in an isolation room. Furthermore, when infection control precautions include masks, even face-to-face interactions with staff provide less sensory input [17]. Indeed, Ebola patients at both Nebraska Medicine and Emory University described frustration with the lack of full face-to-face visual contact as well as minimal tactile connection with others. Patients in source isolation for infections have also reported that isolation hampered their recovery and physical rehabilitation [17, 21, 29]. Finally, for patients isolated due to infectious diseases, the rapid implementation of infection control precautions, often with inadequate explanation [25], may be an additional source of psychological distress [13, 24].",

Thus, a foundational strategy for reducing the potentially harmful psychological effects of isolation is ensuring that patients understand what precautions will be followed and the reasons for their implementation [6, 7, 30, 32, 34, 35]. One obstacle to achieving this objective is the difficulty patients may have processing information when under emotional and physical stress [15].",

Reynolds of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended making an empathic statement within 30 s of meeting the patient in order to calm strong emotions [36]. A lower level of emotional arousal, in turn, can help the patient process the rest of the interaction. Providers should also give patients opportunities to ask questions and should be prepared to repeat information, perhaps multiple times. Along with providing information on infection control practices in both verbal and written forms [30, 32], hospitals can use video and internet-based formats, which some patients prefer [37]. Verbal, written, or video-based material can also include content on normal reactions to isolation and basic coping skills. Finally, if care team members do not speak the patient\u2019s primary language, a professional interpreter is necessary and may require telephone or video conferencing to reduce the risk of exposure.",

Consequently, giving patients as much control as possible over the daily routine, visitors, physical layout of the room, available activities, and, when feasible, the treatment itself may help improve psychological well-being [13, 19, 28, 34]. The long stretches of downtime during hospitalization, for example, provide an opportunity for patients to take some control over the schedule. Toward that end, staff can encourage patients to plan daily routines, including times for reading, eating, bathing, watching television, exercising, making phone calls, and engaging in any hobbies that may be accessible during hospitalization [20, 38, 39]. When possible, such plans should include specific times without interruption [28], which can be empowering for patients who otherwise have little control over healthcare workers\u2019 entering and exiting the room. In a similar vein, identifying and honoring patient preferences regarding visitation from family and friends (in person or via audiovisual media) can also promote patient autonomy [30].",

A small budget to make such activities accessible can go a long way toward ameliorating the potential boredom, loneliness, loss of control, and regression experienced by many patients in isolation.

The young patients in this sample experienced sadness, loneliness, and worry. More generally, hospitalized children may show anxiety, depression, homesickness, fear, withdrawal, and sleep disruption [41\u201344], depending in part on their age and personality characteristics.

For example, while frequent information sharing by the care team is important for pediatric patients [40\u201343], healthcare workers and parents should present information at a level consistent with the patient\u2019s intellect and maturity so as not to overwhelm the child [41]. In this regard, asking children what they \u201cknow\u201d about their hospitalization and isolation is an effective strategy to uncover misapprehensions, such as a belief that they did something wrong or that they are being punished. Likewise, children\u2019s exposure to media coverage of the infection should be limited and discussed to process what the child heard and to clarify misconceptions [40]. Finally, coaching parents to model confidence in the care team and optimism about the outcome of treatment is particularly important for children, who may look to their parents for cues regarding the competence of their providers and the seriousness of their conditions [42].",

[36] cogently summarize approaches that care teams can adopt to support families of patients in isolation. Perhaps the most important is regularly providing information, including specifics regarding the patient\u2019s condition, the treatment, and any risks to the family [18, 36, 40, 48\u201351]. Furthermore, making arrangements to keep family members informed when they are away from the hospital can help reduce anxiety and encourage needed breaks [36, 40, 47]. Additionally, providing information about normal family reactions, including fear of contracting the illness themselves, might help allay concerns among loved ones that their feelings are abnormal and can assuage any guilt about such reactions. When concerned family members include young children, suggesting concrete activities that promote children\u2019s connections to their loved ones in isolation can help. For example, children can draw pictures to decorate the hospital room or help prepare care packages.",

Additional risk factors for psychological distress and mental illness include longer duration of high-risk exposure, younger age, being single, not living with family, fewer years of work experience, lower education, and lower household income [54]. Other important factors to consider are previous history of psychiatric illness, availability of emotional support, and employer-sponsored resilience training [68, 70\u201373].

            "text": "Individual resilience is the ability to reduce the effect of a stressful life event, cope with adversity, or bounce back [74]. Below are strategies that care teams can adopt to promote resilience in HCWs who volunteer or are assigned to work on biocontainment unit teams:Schedule individual information sessions with prospective staff members to review the roles, expectations, responsibilities, challenges, and rewards prior to the formal interview process. In addition to providing an opportunity to address any required occupational health clearance considerations, the session should prompt individuals to think about past experiences working in challenging roles as well as any history of PTSS or PTSD [66].Discuss with prospective staff members the motivating factors that contribute to their pursuit of these high-risk assignments. Frequently cited motivations include the uniqueness of the opportunity, professional interest, excitement about contributing to the field, desire to do something different, recognition, enhancing the reputation of the facility, improving one\u2019s CV, and helping others [55, 56]. HCWs from Emory University and Nebraska Medicine shared similar motivations for work with their biocontainment units.During the initial exploration phase of working in a high-risk environment, discuss with HCWs their suitability and preparation for the work. Verify that staff members have a full understanding of what will be involved from clinical, technical, psychosocial, and community perspectives.Recruit a behavioral health consultant to assist unit leadership in addressing concerns and questions that may emerge during recruitment of prospective staff.Include a resilience measure in preassignment health assessments to identify those at risk for developing a mental health disorder during or after the assignment [54].During the initial orientation and training, incorporate a module on behavioral health considerations, including strategies for strengthening resilience. This is currently part of the training sponsored by the National Ebola Training and Education Center (NETEC). Educating teams about behavioral health risks related to working in biocontainment units reinforces the importance of self and team care while reducing the stigma associated with psychological distress.Consider peer support training, which is a frequently cited approach to enable active monitoring for PTSS [66]. The trauma risk management (TRiM) program, for example, is used by military forces, media companies, and diplomatic organizations. Another model is psychological first aid, which can be implemented to support staff with early signs of distress [66, 74].Provide ongoing education sessions related to symptom recognition, effective coping strategies, and stigma reduction.Integrate a behavioral health specialist (BHS) into the biocontainment team. The BHS can provide on-site support (individual and group) utilizing a psychological first aid approach. This strategy serves as a bridge for HCWs to access a mental health clinician, who can connect staff to other providers as needed. Both the Emory Special Communicable Diseases Unit (SCDU) and Nebraska Medicine NBU have incorporated psychological support services through the Faculty Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) and the Behavioral Health division, respectively. Ideally, the BHS should attend regular team training sessions so that staff is familiar and comfortable with the provider. When the unit is activated, the BHS should spend time in the staff break room to maintain visibility and access.Establish a mentorship or \u201cbuddy\u201d system that pairs new staff with more experienced colleagues [59].Provide access to individual counseling and support groups to manage psychological distress, including secondary traumatization [58, 62, 69]. These services can be provided by internal resources such as occupational health, employee assistance programs (EAP), or hospital behavioral health departments.Arrange debriefing sessions when critical incidents occur. These services can be offered by the BHS or spiritual health providers to support HCWs with processing complex feelings about the biocontainment work, especially once patients are discharged or pass away.",

For HCWs treating infectious diseases, family resilience is essential, as family members are often affected by the work choices and experiences of their loved ones. Moreover, HCWs need to feel confident that their families are coping effectively while they are engaged in special assignments. Accordingly, health systems should develop strategies to foster resilience in family members before, during, and after special assignments [57, 76]. A variety of approaches are summarized below.Schedule a pre-deployment general information session about unit activation procedures, staff member roles, equipment, responsibilities, and stressors. Address fears, risks, and coping strategies as part of the session [55, 64]. One study found that this approach assisted HCWs with the transition back to their usual jobs after completion of their assignments [70].Encourage families to develop a \u201cfamily plan\u201d to address how roles and responsibilities, such as carpooling, grocery shopping, and meal preparation, might be altered should the HCW face quarantine or increased work hours.Provide additional sessions to update families on the unique aspects of particular unit activations. This may be offered online, in person, or via conference call.Arrange periodic group support sessions for HCWs\u2019 families. In addition, an annual family outing or picnic provides family members an opportunity to develop relationships that can reduce the isolation they may feel during an activation.Alert family members to the possibility of media interest in unit activations, and discuss potential consequences of sharing information with friends, employers, colleagues, and community contacts.Upon unit deactivation, schedule family debriefing sessions to enhance knowledge, respond to inquiries, and promote family resilience.",

Future research should examine the individual, family, illness, treatment, and environmental factors that predict who will be most impacted by source isolation. In addition, prospective research with baseline and multiple follow-up periods could help clarify the relationship between duration of isolation and patient distress. Such research should also evaluate patients after discharge to explore possible long-term psychological sequelae of various infectious diseases and their treatment. Preliminary evidence shows that, for example, 4\u20137 months after discharge, patients treated for Ebola continue to have psychological or cognitive symptoms, including sleep disturbance, short-term memory loss, and depression or anxiety [54]. Furthermore, randomized trials of interventions proposed to mitigate the impact of isolation are necessary, along with efforts to determine which interventions are best suited for which patients. Moreover, as most of the studies on source isolation involve patients with MDROs, more work is needed to examine the psychological impact of isolation in the context of treatment for potentially deadly infections, such as Ebola.",

Furthermore, additional research on interventions designed to promote resilience before, during, and after deployment is necessary. Such studies can guide healthcare systems in providing the most effective support possible to protect the workforce from psychological distress and mental illness. While there is a tendency for investigators to focus primarily on nurses and physicians because of their frontline patient care responsibilities, ancillary team members are also vulnerable to the psychological distress inherent in the work with emerging infectious diseases. These positions may include patient transport staff, lab workers, pharmacists, facility management professionals (especially those handling biohazardous waste), and administrative assistants. From recruitment and training to activation and debriefing, it is essential to provide our workforce evidence-based, comprehensive behavioral health services to prevent, treat, and manage the negative psychological effects of high-stress and high-risk biocontainment unit activations.",
