For example, electrostatic forces result in some of the nonspecific adherence of particles to the cell surface.

The advantage of infectivity assays is that binding of very small amounts of virus can be detected and viral replication, a biologic function, is being measured. Infectivity assays have the following limitations: (1) Only binding of infectious viral particles can be measured. Most viral preparations have particle to plaque-forming unit (PFU) ratios of 10 to 100 and it is likely that noninfectious virus also binds to cellular receptor sites. (2) The measurement of infectious particles by plaque assay is time consuming, cumbersome, and statistically error-prone, making the generation of quantitative data difficult. (3) When infectious centers are being measured, cells which bear membrane receptors but which are unable to support viral replication cannot be detected. Attachment to such cells must be detected by measurement of virus removal from the media.

In this approach, pseudotype virions were created which contained the envelope of one virus and the infectious genome of another. Pseudotype virions were generated by the mixed infection of VSV (for which the cells being studied were permissive) and various retroviruses (for which the cells were not permissive). Resultant virions that contained VSV envelopes were then inactivated by anti-VSV neutralizing antibodies. The remaining pseudotype virions (retrovirus envelope + VSV genome) bound to the cell surface receptor for the retrovirus being studied and resulted in. VSV replication.

For example, indirect immunofluorescence techniques were used to define B cells as the lymphocyte subset susceptible to EBV infection (Jondal and Klein, 1973) . The major advantage of measuring virus binding by indirect immunofluorescence is that it affords a qualitative approach for the study of viral-receptor interactions. This is especially relevant for studying primary cell cultures which contain a mixture of cell types. For example, for the study of serotype-specific binding of reovirus to cells in the nervous system, we prepared cell suspensions from mouse brain which contained 75% ciliated ependymal cells; these cells are easily identified under phase microscopy by their cilia. Using indirect immunofluorescence, it was possible to demonstrate that reovirus type 1 (which has an in vivo affinity for ependymal cells) but not type 3 binds to these cells (see Fig.  2A and B, discussed in detail later). Similarly, indirect immunofluorescence was used to demonstrate that reovirus type 3 binds to a subset of murine and human lymphocytes ( Fig. 2D ) (Weiner et al., 1980a) . \"Co-capping\" studies are an extension of the indirect immunofluorescence approach. These experiments take advantage of the property of physiologically active cells to modulate receptor sites bound by ligand to one pole of the cell (Fig. 2C ). Using two different colored fluorochromes (one to mark bound virus and the other to label another cell surface structure) it is possible to determine if a cell surface component moves in association with the viral receptor when viral receptors are modulated to one pole of the cell. This approach demonstrated that EBV receptors on cultured cells were closely associated with complement receptors (Yefenof er al., 1976) . Co-capping studies also demonstrated that reovirus receptors on murine lymphocytes are distinct from other surface antigens, such as C3 and Fc receptors (Epstein et al., 1981) .",

We have developed the plate-adherence technique for the study of reovirus-receptor interactions. In this technique, cells are first incubated with virus and then with a rabbit antiviral antibody. These cells are then plated on a Petri dish previously coated with a goat-anti-rabbit immunoglobulin and separated into adherent and nonadherent populations.

Although it has been suggested that in certain cases viral binding is virtually irreversible, some dissociation of bound virus probably occurs for most interactions (Lonberg-Holm, 198 1). Rapid penetration after binding is one reason that dissociation has been difficult to measure. Initial studies from our laboratory have estimated very low Kd values for reovirus binding to L cells and lymphocytes, demonstrating extremely high-affinity binding sites for reovirus (Epstein et al., unpublished data) .",

To explain how this network might function during the normal immune response to a virus, assume that the virus has one antigenic determinant. That determinant will bind to B lymphocytes with an appropriate receptor or \"idiotype\" on the cell surface. The antiviral antibodies produced by the B lymphocytes bear idiotypic determinants that can bind the virus. These idiotypic determinants are themselves immunogenic and serve as antigens, so that antiidiotypic antibodies are made. These antiidiotypic antibodies do not bind virus, but may bind to the cell surface structure that originally bound the virus. Thus, in theory, they could be used as specific antireceptor antibodies. This approach was first used in endocrinology. Antiidiotypic antibodies were raised against antibodies to retinol binding protein and to insulin. These antiidiotypic antibodies were shown to recognize the cell surface receptor for either retinol binding protein or insulin. Furthermore, it was found that antiidiotypic antibodies made against insulin antibodies mimicked the biological effects of insulin on adipocytes (Sege and Peterson, 1978) .",

The antiidiotype antiserum was then absorbed with normal mouse immunoglobulins, and purified by using a monoclonal antibody to the neutralization site on the hemagglutinin of reovirus type 3. These purified antiidiotypic antibodies mimicked the virus in their binding patterns to various cell lines. Moreover, they bound to primary cultures of murine neuronal cells (which bind reovirus type 3) but did not bind to freshly prepared ependymal cells (which bind reovirus type 1 but not type 3). In addition, they appear to mimic the virus in its interaction with murine T lymphocytes (see Section V,A) (Nepom et al., in preparation; Tardieu et al., 1982) . Thus, it appears that these antiidiotypic antibodies might recognize the CRS for reovirus type 3 on neurons and lymphocytes.

The concept of \"viral receptor families\" was introduced by Lonberg-Holm et al. (1976) . In their experiments, they were able to block the binding of one virus to the cell surface by preincubating the cells with an unrelated virus (see Boulanger and Philipson, 1981 , for review). Binding was measured either by infectivity (using UV-inactivated virus for blocking), by radiolabeled virus (using unlabeled virus for blocking), or by immunofluorescence (using specific antiviral antibody which recognized the blocking virus). These studies established that HeLa cells have receptors for a variety of picornaviruses, and that some viruses share common receptors. Thus, the three poliovirus serotypes compete for a common receptor, which is distinct from the receptors that bind the six groups of Coxsackie B viruses (Crowell, 1966 (Crowell, , 1976 . Coxsackie viruses A13, A15, and A18 have a distinct receptor from the other two groups and Echoviruses and human rhinoviruses have separate receptors from the other picomaviruses (Crowell and Siak, 1978) . Moreover, receptors were shown to be shared between viruses from different groups. Thus, the binding of adenovirus type 2 to HeLa cells was blocked by Coxsackie B3, and binding of human rhinovirus type 14 was blocked by Coxsackie virus A21 (Lonberg-Holm ef al., 1976) . Confirmation of \"receptor families\" as defined in these experiments will ultimately depend upon biochemical characterization of the viral receptor sites.",

For example, two serotypes of reovirus, types 1 and 3, differ in their ability to bind to primary cell cultures. Reovirus type 3 binds to neurons and lymphocytes whereas reovirus type I binds to ependymal cells (see below). In addition, binding experiments using 1251-labeled virions suggest different binding patterns of the two reovirus serotypes to L cells even though both serotypes do bind to and grow in this continuous cell line. (Epstein ef al., unpublished) . Specific receptors for the two serotypes of Herpes simplex virus have also been described (Vahlne et al., 1979) . In these experiments, Herpes simplex type 1 (HSV 1) interfered with the adsorption of HSV 1 but not of HSV2 to human, monkey, and rabbit permanent cell lines. The adsorption rate was measured by assaying infective virus remaining in the medium or by measuring cell associated [3H]thymidine-labeled HSV. Adsorption profiles demonstrated that the monkey kidney cell line and the rabbit cornea cell line had more HSVl than HSV2 receptors, while HeLa cells expressed more receptors with affinity for type 2 than for type 1. Human embryonic lung cells and a cell line derived from a human carcinoma of the larynx showed equal amounts of HSV 1 and HSV2 receptors. Our experiments demonstrate that HSV 1 binds significantly more to murine ependymal cells than HSV2 .",

Murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) are classified as ecotropic, xenotropic, or amphotropic depending on their ability to infect mouse cells, cells of other species, or cells of both mice and other species, respectively. Using the \"cross-interference\" approach, it was shown that cells infected with one ecotropic virus failed to bind a second ecotropic strain (R-MuLV), whereas cells infected with a xenotropic virus bound R-MuLV as well as uninfected cells (Hartley and Rowe, 1976; Besmer and Baltimore, 1977) . Thus, murine ecotropic and xenotropic viruses appear to recognize different receptors on the murine cell surface, but various strains of ecotropic MuLV utilize the same receptors, since they are subject to cross-interference (Sarma et al., 1967) ; DeLarco and Todaro (1976) subsequently showed that infection of murine cells with various ecotropic viruses (S2CL3, AKR, R-MuLV, M-MuLV) prevented the binding of radiolabelled R-MuLV gp71 (the VAP of R-MuLV) to the surface of the infected cells. Interference studies using purified gp7 1 demonstrated that the ecotropic viruses used the same family of receptors despite marked differences in the antigenic properties of the viruses. It was then confirmed that the murine xenotropic, as well as amphotropic viruses, use a different family of receptors from murine ecotropic viruses, since they did not interfere with viral infectivity or gp7 1 binding.",

It is important, however, to also study viral binding to cells which may be the target of viral infection in vivo. This approach has been most easily implemented using freshly isolated lymphocytes for the study of virus-receptor interaction with lymphocyte subpopulations. For example, Epstein-Ban virus selectively binds to human B lymphocytes, mouse adapted cytomegalovirus binds to murine B lymphocytes, and measles and murine leukemia virus bind to human T lymphocytes (Greaves, 1976) . Woodruff and Woodruff (1974) have done a variety of studies on the binding of myxoviruses and paramyxoviruses to murine lymphocytes. They have found that Sendai virus, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), influenza B virus and influenza A (H2N2) or (H3N2) virus agglutinate T lymphocytes in v i m , and, presumably, T lymphocytes have a receptor for these viruses. The receptors on T lymphocytes for the paramyxoviruses they studied (Sendai and NDV) differ from those for the myxoviruses (influenza). This was shown by differences in binding between these group of viruses according to temperature or in vitro treatment with fetuin, N-acetyl neuraminic acid, or periodate. In addition, after elution of NDV from lymphocytes, the lymphocytes are agglutinable by influenza virus but not by NDV or Sendai virus. The nine serotypes of influenza A virus they studied also demonstrated differences in their ability to bind T and B cells: five strains agglutinated T and B cells whereas four agglutinated only B lymphocytes. Thus lymphocyte receptors can distinguish among various serotypes of influenza A virus.",

Clone 3.HA1, which contains nine genes from reovirus type 3 and one, the S1 gene, which encodes for the viral hemagglutinin, from type 1, bound to ependymal cells, whereas the reciprocal clone 1 .HA3 did not.

This issue is particularly relevant since most studies of viral binding have utilized permanent cell lines. It is not known to what extent there is homology between surface receptors on the different cell lines to which a virus binds, or, more importantly, whether results obtained from binding studies using transformed cells can be generalized to in vivo virus-surface receptor interactions. Early investigations suggested that different structures served as viral receptors on different cell lines (Kodza and Junglebut, 1958; Sabin, 1959; Holland and McLarren, 1961) . One experimental approach to address this issue is to compare two different permissive cell lines for such variables as number of receptors per cell, affinity of these receptors for virus, or susceptibility of receptors to inactivation by agents such as proteolytic enzymes. For example, Sindbis virus replicates in both mammalian and mosquito cell lines. Smith and Tignor (1980) studied the attachment of two Sindbis virus strains (avirulent or neurovirulent) to these cell lines both before and after enzyme treatment of the cells. Mammalian cellular receptors for the avirulent strain were sensitive to proteolytic cleavage while mosquito cells were insensitive to protease, phospholipase, and neuraminidase. The difference was less striking but still present for the neurovirulent strain.",

Transfer was accomplished using vesicles reconstituted from a mixture of purified Raji membranes and Sendai virus envelope proteins. Successful implantation of receptor-rich membranes into the membrane of the nonpermissive cells was demonstrated by monitoring the fate of radioiodinated donor membrane, and was confirmed by the detection of surface EBV receptors and complement C3 receptors (which are closely associated with EBV receptor) (Yefenof et al.,  1976) on implanted cells. EBV receptors could be detected for 36 hours after implantation and radiolabeled EBV bound specifically to receptor-implanted cells.

These cellular receptors have been identified as glycoproteins with N-acetyl neuraminic acid as the terminal sugar in the carbohydrate side chains (Gottshalk, 1957) . To further elucidate the role of sialic acid in cell permissiveness, binding of virus to isolated, highly purified gangliosides of defined structure was studied (Svennerholm and Fredman, 1980) . Initially, binding to polystyrene Petri dishes coated with different gangliosides was studied (Holmgren et al., 1980) , then host cells were made resistant to Sendai virus by removal of endogenous viral receptor with Vibrio cholerae sialidase (Markwell and Paulson, 1980) . These receptor-negative cells were then incubated with individual purified gangliosides. Incubation of cells with gangliosides containing the sequence NeuAccu2, 3 GalPl , 3GalNAc fully restored susceptibility to Sendai virus infection. Furthermore, incubation with gangliosides with a sequence ending with two sialic acids in a NeuAca2, 8Neu-Ac linkage, rather than a single sialic acid, was 100 times more effective (Markwell et al., 1981) . In an analogous way, susceptibility to Polyoma virus infection was restored by implantation of the sequence NeuAca2, 3GalP1, 3GalNAc but not the sequence NeuAca2, 6GalP 1, 4GlcNAc even though the latter sequence contained a comparable amount of sialic acid (Fried et al., 1981) . Thus, Sendai and Polyoma virus interact with specific ganglioside sequences and cell susceptibility to infection can be modified by implantation of different gangliosides into the cell membrane.",

This approach is limited, however, by the lack of fine specificity of the antiserum. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the cell surface offer a more specific avenue for the generation of antireceptor antibody and recent work showing the blocking of Coxsackie virus binding to HeLa cells by monoclonal antibodies demonstrates that this should be a feasible approach (Campell and Cords, 1982) . A similar approach has recently been described for monoclonal antibodies made against the thyrotropin receptor. These monoclonal antibodies competitively block binding of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) but are unable to stimulate adenyl cyclase activity as TSH does. This result suggests the existence of a second domain on the receptor which is associated with the stimulating activity (Yavin et al., 1981) .",

The hemagglutinin of paramyxoviruses binds to neuraminic acid-containing cell surface receptors and has neuraminidase activity which eliminates natural neuraminic acid-containing receptors from infected cells (reviewed by Choppin and Scheid, 1980) . These two functions reside on two separate proteins in orthomyxoviruses. The role of neuraminidase activity, which is paradoxically present on the same viral protein that determines viral binding, is unclear. It has recently been shown that these two opposing activities can be regulated by environmental conditions such as chloride concentration and pH: high concentrations of halide ion enhance hemagglutinating activity and decrease elution from erythrocytes, while they inhibit neuraminidase activity (Merz et al., 1981) . Studies with a specific chemical inhibitor of neuraminidase (Palese et al., 1974a; Palese and Compans, 1976 ) and temperature-sensitive mutants (Palese et al., 1974b) suggest a role for neuraminidase activity during the release of newly synthesized virus. Because of enhancement by low chloride ion concentration and an acidic pH, the neuraminidase activity is most prominently expressed intracellularly . In contrast, the ionic environment in the extracellular fluids favors virus attachment over receptor-destroying activity.",

In several instances, cells from adult animals are not as permissive for viral replication as cells from newborn animals, even though they appear to have the appropriate viral receptors. For example, allantoic sac cells from young chicken embryos are more permissive for influenza or vesicular stomatitis viruses than cells from older embryos. This age-dependent difference in permissiveness is due to a late intracellular event since viral attachment and penetration are the same in cells from young and old chicken embryos (White, 1959; Morahan and Grossberg, 1970) . In our investigations, we have found that both isolated newborn and adult ependymal cells have receptors for reovirus type 1 even though ependymitis is observed more prominently in newborns . In contrast, in studies of Coxsackie B5 infection of fibroblasts, Kunin (1962) reported that a slightly decreased ability to absorb the virus occurs in adult as compared to newborn cells, correlating with a decreased permissiveness of adult cells for viral replication. In this instance, the age-dependent reduction in permissiveness may be related to a change in receptor affinity for virus in older cells.",

Somatic hybrids made between permissive (human) and resistant (rodent) cells (Belehradek and Barski, 1969; Wang et al., 1970) demonstrated that hybrids could be infected by poliovirus only when human chromosome 19 was present (Miller et al., 1974) . Since viral replication does not require the presence of human genes once the viral nucleic acid has entered the cell Wang et al., 1970) , these experiments demonstrated that chromosome 19 carries the structural gene for the poliovirus receptor. On the other hand, permissiveness of cells for echo-7 and rhino-1A viruses could not be linked to the presence of a specific human chromosome (Miller et al., 1974) .",

It should be noted, however, that, for MuLV, the gene expressed on chromosome 5 does not solely regulate leukemia virus replication. Another gene (Fv-I), located on murine chromosome 4, regulates the replication of the virus at a postpenetration step and may influence integration of proviral DNA into the host chromosome (Rowe and Sato, 1973; Gazdar e t a ] . , 1977). AS noted by Ruddle et a / . ( 1 978) , additional host control is exerted at the level of differentiation, since bone marrow-derived but not thymus-derived lymphocytes are able to support replication of exogenous MuLV.

The 22to 30-nm capsid contains 60 copies of a \"structural unit\" consisting of four separate polypetides, VPI , 2, 3, and 4. Some picornaviruses contain a few copies of a precursor protein (VPO) which contains uncleaved VP2:VP4. It has been known for many years that shortly after poliovirus binds to cells, a fraction of the attached virus elutes (Halperen et a/. , 1964) . This eluted virus has lost the polypeptide VP4 and is no longer infectious (Lonberg-Holm and Philipson, 1974) . These experiments suggested that VP4 was the attachment protein. Further studies, however, provided contradictory evidence: ( I ) VP4 could not be labeled by techniques which label surface proteins such as '2sl-labeling using lactoperoxidase (e.g., Lonberg-Holm and Butterworth, 1976) . (2) Naturally occuring empty capsids (top component) of some picornaviruses demonstrated identical binding characteristics as native virus, but were shown to lack VP4. (3) Antibodies to VP4 do not recognize the surface of native virions (Talbot et al., 1973) . Other evidence suggests that VPl is the binding protein. VP1 is expressed on the surface of the capsid, and trypsin treatment of virions (which renders them incapable of binding to cells) appears to primarily cleave VPI , although some studies also have shown cleavage of VP3 (Boulanger, 1975; Boulanger and Lonberg-Holm, 1981) . For Coxsackie virus B3 there is also evidence that VP2 is present at the capsid surface (Philipson el ul., 1973) . Some investigations have suggested that no single protein functions as the viral attachment site, but that cooperative interactions among the viral proteins result in a unique conforma-tional state which allows binding. This view is supported by the demonstration of differences in antigenicity between native virions ( \"D antigenic\") and inactive subviral particles ( ' 'C antigenic\") for several enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. Native particles carry few of the antigenic determinants of inactive particles (Lonberg-Holm and Yin, 1973) . Since the ability to attach to cells is irreversibly lost during the conversion from Dto C-antigenicity (Lonberg-Holm and Yin, 1973) , this suggests that the conformation of capsid polypeptides may play a key role in the ability of the virion to attach to host cells, perhaps by regulating exposure of a polypeptide sequence carrying the determinants required for binding activity.",

The outer capsid is composed of three polypeptides (plC, a3, and al) which are individually coded by three different viral genes. The a 1 polypeptide makes up I-2% of the outer capsid (24 copies per virion) and is located at the vertices of the icosahedral structure. The a1 polypeptide is the major determinant of reovirus interactions with cells. It is the viral hemagglutinin, elicits the formation of neutralizing antibody, and is responsible for development of delayed type hypersensitivity, generation of suppressor T cells, and generation of cytolytic T lymphocytes (Weiner and Fields, 1977; Weiner et al., 1980b; Greene and Weiner, 1980; Fontana and Weiner, 1980; Finberg et al., 1979) . As described previously, it also determines the serotype specificity of viral tropism for different cells in the nervous system and the ultimate pattern of CNS virulence (Weiner et al., 1977 Tardieu and Weiner, 1982) . Tryptic peptide analysis of the a1 polypeptide from reovirus serotypes 1,2, and 3 has demonstrated both unique and common methionine-and tyrosine-containing peptides. This suggests that certain regions of the hemagglutinin have been conserved, while others have \"drifted\" with resultant serotypic changes (Gentsch and Fields, 198 1). Monoclonal antibodies prepared against the viral hemagglutinin of reovirus type 3 have defined at least four antigenically different domains. One class of antibodies had neutralizing activity; a second class only hemagglutination inhibition (HI) activity. One monoclonal antibody had neutralizing and HI activity and a fourth class of monoclonal antibodies had no detectable neutralization or HI activity. These results suggest that marked functional specialization exists within regions of the reovirus type 3 hemagglutinin (Burstin et al., 1982) . This separation of regions for hemagglutination and neutralization raises the possibility that, for other viruses as well, there might be separate viral determinants which bind to either red cells (hemagglutination) or host cells (infection). This suggests that RBC receptors and receptors on other cell types may not be homologous.",

The F glycoprotein is responsible for fusion activity (and thus hemolysis) and is involved in virus penetration into the cell (to be discussed in the next section).

Influenza C virions differ as they have no neuraminidase. HA is the glycoprotein responsible for hemagglutination or adsorption to host cells and antigenic variations in this protein are largely responsible for periodic epidemics of influenza. Monoclonal antibodies raised against the HA of influenza A have identified three or four nonoverlapping antigenic domains on the protein (Wiley et al., 1981; Wilson et al., 1981) . Direct correlation of these domains with functional differences have yet to be defined, but the structural definition of the HA has provided initial answers. The host-receptor binding site and antigenic determinants are located on a globular region which lies on top of a long fibrous coiled coil; the fusion activation peptide is located near the virus membrane end of the molecule (Laver and Valentine, 1969; Gerhard et al., 1981; Wiley et al., 1981; Wilson et al., 1981) .",

These latter experiments were performed using the major external glycoprotein (gp52) of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). Two topographically distinct sites have been identified on gp.52. One site functions as a target for neutralization antibody and was defined by the observation that all monoclonal antibodies (MAb) which neutralized virus infectivity also competed for binding of a neutralizing MAb (used as a standard). The second site bound antibody but this binding had no effect on neutralization. This site was topographically distinct and its MAb could not compete for binding of a second neutralizing MAb (Massey and Schochetman, 1981a) . It was further shown that the neutralizing site described above was not the receptor binding site but was adjacent to it as monoclonal antibodies were found which competed for the binding of the first neutralizing MAb but did not neutralize the virus. These antibodies functioned as blocking antibodies and protected virus particles from neutralization (Massey and Schochetman, 198 1 b) .",

Monospecific antibodies directed against E2 glycoprotein prevent viral attachment. Virions lacking E2 (either because of growth in the presence of tunicamycin or treatment with bromelain) do not attach to the cell membrane. In addition, isolated E2 binds to the same receptor as intact virus since pretreatment of cells with unlabeled, concentrated MHV blocks the binding of raidolabeled E2. Thus, the E2 glycoprotein appears to be the virus attachment protein for the A59 strain of MHV (K. Holmes, personal communication; Holmes et al., 1981) .",

Initial studies with picornaviruses using organ minces and homogenates demonstrated a correlation between the presence of receptors on cells and the known in vivo tropism of poliovirus. Human and monkey CNS tissue and intestine were able to adsorb polioviruses whereas tissues from human lung, heart, and skin were not. The correlation was not absolute, however, since receptors were also detected on human liver, monkey heart, and skeletal muscles. Furthermore, poliovirus vaccine strains which did not induce cell damage were shown to bind to brain tissues Holland, 1961; Kunin and Jordan, 1961; LaPlaca, 1963; Harter and Choppin, 1965) . A second line of evidence demonstrating a relationship between cell surface receptors and pathogenicity was the presence of a correlation between the grouping of viruses by receptor specificities and their classification according to subgroups which were derived from patterns of pathogenesis (see Section III,C and Lonberg-Holm et al., 1976) . Finally, specific organ cultures have been used to show different growth specificities for picornaviruses. For example, some rhinoviruses multiply only in differentiated organ cultures of trachea (Hoorn and Tyrell, 1966) ; Coxsackie viruses A1 and A5 grow in differentiating primary fetal mouse muscles cultures but do not grow in nondifferentiating mouse cultures (Came and Crowell, 1964; Landau et al., 1972) . In contrast, receptors for human enteroviruses exist on tissues which are not involved in their pathogenesis and in species other than their natural hosts (Holland, 1961; Kunin and Jordan, 1961; LaPlaca, 1963; Campbell, 1965) .",

Using recombinant clones derived from crosses between reovirus types 1 and 3, it has been shown that the hemagglutinin of reovirus (encoded by the S1 gene) determines the central nervous system cell tropism of the reovirus serotypes (Weiner et al., 1977 . Reovirus type 3 and clone 1 .HA3 (containing nine genes from type I and the gene encoding the hemagglutinin from type 3) cause a fatal encephalitis in newborn mice with neuronal destruction but no ependymal cell damage whereas reovirus type 1 and clone 3.HAl (the reciprocal clone to clone 1 .HA3) cause ependymal infection without neuronal damage. The affinity of the two serotypes for two different cell types in the nervous system appears to be due to the specific interaction of the viral hemagglutinin with the receptors on the surface of either ependymal cells or neuronal cells. These results have been confirmed in vitro by demonstrating that reovirus type 1 and clone 3.HA1 (but not reovirus type 3 and clone 1.HA3) bound to isolated human and murine ependymal cells ( Fig. 2A and B) . The reciprocal results have been shown on neural cells in culture (Dichter and Weiner, unpublished data; see Fig. 2E and F).",

The interaction between a paramyxovirus and the cell surface is mediated by two glycoproteins projecting from the external surface of the virion: the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and the fusion (F) glycoprotein. Binding to cellular neuraminic acid-containing receptors is a property of the HN glycoprotein. Although this activity differs considerably according to the amount and position of neuraminic acid in the molecule (Markwell et al., 1981) , the abundance of sialic acid in many biologic membranes limits the importance of the binding step as a determinant of cell specificity and tissue tropism. An active fusion (F) glycoprotein, however, is a requisite for infectivity and cell-to-cell spread of infection. The fusion glycoprotein acts during viral penetration, a step beyond adsorption. Virus infectivity requires cleavage of a precursor FO glycoprotein into two subunits (Fl, F2) and the host must provide the enzyme responsible for this cleavage (reviewed in Choppin and Scheid, 1980) . Thus, host-dependent cleavage of FO is required for infectivity and therefore host range and tissue tropism of virus is determined by availability of the appropriate protease Choppin, 1975, 1976) .",

            "text": "It has recently been shown that neuraminidase (NANase) activity of the HN glycoprotein of mumps virus contributes to cytopathology . Although the HN glycoproteins of the six studied strains of mumps virus are similar in size and antigenic composition, each strain possesses a neuraminidase with distinct enzymatic properties. Strains with active NANase cause little cytopathology and no cell fusion on African green kidney cell lines, whereas infection with strains having less active NANase cause extensive cell fusion. Thus, viral NANase appears to contribute to full expression of the activity of the F protein and ultimately to cytopathology (Merz and Wolinsky, 1981) . This extends the previous observation that influenza virions with less active NANase cause more cytopathology in tissue culture and were more pathogenic in viva than virions containing active NANase (Smith and Cohen, 1956; Choppin, 1963; Choppin and Tamm, 1964) . Moreover, only strains of mumps virus with less active NANase were both neuroinvasive and neurovirulent (Wolinsky and Stroop, 1978; McCarthy et af., 1980) . Thus, the pathogenicity of myxo-and paramyxovirus depends upon an interaction of viral glycoproteins and the cell surface at a step beyond viral adsorption. Cell specificity is determined by the availability of a protease on the surface of the cell to cleave one of the viral glycoproteins and allow viral penetration into the cell. There are few data concerning the role of viral receptor interactions in the pathogenicity of other enveloped viruses.",

These include the production of autoantibodies against a variety of host antigens in experimental animals and man (DNA, lymphocytes, myelin) (reviewed in Onodera et af., 1981) , and in man, the well-documented immunemediated damage to peripheral nerve myelin in infectious polyneuritis (Guillain-Barre Syndrome) which can occur 2-3 weeks after viral infections or following swine flu immunization (Schonberger et al., 1981) . The mechanisms by which a viral infection can lead to an autoimmune response are not well understood, however, two possible mechanisms are relevant to the present review: (1) autoantibodies which appear following viral infection may recognize shared antigens between a viral protein and a determinant on the surface of the target cell; and (2) through the idiotypic-antiidiotypic network (described in Section II,C) antiidiotypic antibodies could be produced which recognize the viral receptor on the cell surface. Thus, the affinity of these autoantibodies for a particular cell would be identical to the tropism of the virus itself for the cell. To test these two hypotheses, we recently performed the following experiment: splenic lymphocytes from adult mice infected with purified reovirus (type 1 or 3) particles were fused with NS-1 myeloma cells. The resultant clones were then screened by radioimmunoassay for their ability to bind virus, T lymphocytes, brain, liver, and lung tissues. We found that (1) during the course of the normal immune response to reovirus, autoantibodies were generated which reacted with normal tissue, (2) monoclonal antibodies were generated which identified shared antigenic structures between viral determinants and normal tissue, and (3) some monoclonal antibodies appeared to have the same affinity for cells as the virus (putative antiidiotypic antibodies which recognize viral receptors) .",

These reagents will lead to the isolation and biologic characterization of both the CRU and the functional domains on the virus attachment protein; and (3) techniques for the isolation of single cell suspensions from organs such as brain.

( 2 ) , one may express the number of bound virus receptors [RL] as a function of viral concentration [L] in terms of two parameters, the Kd value and Rtotal, the total number of available binding sites in the preparation: The concentration at which [L] = Kd is a useful point on this curve, since it is the concentration of ligand at which 50% of the total receptor sites are occupied ([RL] = '/2 [R,,,,,]). Thus, Kd, the equilibrium dissociation constant, is a measure of the affinity of a receptor for its ligand, since a small Kd value indicates a tightly binding (high-affinity) ligand which saturates its receptor at a low ligand concentration (seeFig. IA). Hence, Kd is a standard measure used to compare the binding of ligands to a variety of receptors. It is important to note, however, that these equations express Kd in terms of the concentration of free ligand when equilibrium has been reached. At this point, the value of L, the concentration of free ligand, must be very close to the value of Ltota,, since as for R , the value of Ltotal = L + LR. Therefore, binding studies are usually performed in a range",

One such form, the Scatchard plot shown in Fig. IB, plots [boundIfree ligand] against [bound ligand]. The purpose of this analysis is to allow the binding parameters to be directly estimated from the linear plot. Rearranging Eq. (4) to this form one obtains the expression:",
