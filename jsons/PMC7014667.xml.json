However, the aqueous environment presents unique challenges to infection prevention and control (IPC), with wet surfaces providing the solid-liquid interface that predisposes to biofilm formation [8]. These biofilms have been proven to harbour multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms (MDRO) [2, 9] which were genetically related to clinical isolates suggesting that aqueous environment can serve as a reservoir for human infections. Furthermore, waste material disposed into the sinks and drains potentially provide the nutrients necessary for the formation and maintenance of biofilms which function as a reservoir for MDRO [10]. These MDRO are not contained within the hospital environment but may spread into the community via the sewage system. Across the world, in Singapore, Bangladesh, India, Lebanon and Spain, raw hospital sewage has been shown to contain Carbapenamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and other MDRGN [11\u201317]. As such, it is crucial that environmental contamination and subsequent transmission of MDRGN within the hospital is prevented.",

Following sink replacement, CRPA reappeared on sink surveillance cultures after a mean duration of 13 weeks. Drainpipes were CRPA culture positive as well, suggesting that the reservoir was lower down in the drainage system. Even following acetic acid treatment, 2 wall pipes remained positive after 10 weeks. Sink drains, siphon and pipes to the wall were then changed again, but after 5 weeks, 1 pipe became positive again. All bathroom sinks continued to be treated with acetic acid, and after at least 2 weeks of acetic acid treatment, the nosocomial transmission of CRPA was stopped. Clinical CRPA infections reappeared when the acetic acid treatment was stopped.",

Enhanced infection control and prevention measures were then adopted with daily cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces of the patients\u2019 room and washroom. The shower and sink drains were also mechanically cleaned and then disinfected.

Other water safe strategies were also implemented during the study period, including the use of antibacterial water filters which were replaced monthly, replacement of sink siphons and aerators every 3 months, use of filtered water from central sinks and use of 2% chlorhexidine impregnated washcloths for patients\u2019 daily hygiene, and discarding dirty water in a disposal room separate from patient areas. Other infection control and prevention strategies were also introduced, including measures to improve hand hygiene, contact precautions for and cohorting of patients colonized or infected with MDRGN, use of dedicated equipment, updating environmental cleaning protocols and adoption of ultraviolet light disinfection technology for terminal cleaning of isolation rooms. The role of water safe strategies was also supported by another quasi-experimental study in which sink removal and use of water-free patient care in the ICU resulted in the reduction of MDRGN colonisation rates [27]. There was a reduced rate of ICU acquired gram-negative bacilli after removal of sinks and the introduction of water-free patient care. While it is difficult to attribute the reduction of MDRGN to sink removal conclusively, the above studies highlight the potential role of sinks as a source for MDRGN infections and the importance of IPC strategies for prevention of MDRGN acquisition from the aqueous environment.",

The difference in contamination of sink drains based on the proximity to the toilets suggest that sink drains may be contaminated by the droplets generated during flushing of toilets. This emphasizes the need for IPC intervention at the design stage of wards and patient rooms. In a mathematical modelling study by Julia et al. [29], among the risk factors identified for sink contamination were the presence of a sink in adjacent rooms sharing common plumbing, status of sink in the past 30 days, status of patient in the same room, presence of MDRO positive patient in past 14 days, presence of MDRO positive patient in adjacent room, and infection-control interventions performed in past 7 days.

In the first 2 weeks of the experiment, no environmental contamination was detected from the sink to the level of the waste trap. However, when a biofilm was allowed to develop, the sink strainer became colonized with GFP expressing E. coli. Subsequently, environmental contamination during faucet use occurred as a result of droplet dispersion [30, 31]. Likewise, when the sink bowl was already contaminated, the use of the sink resulted in environmental contamination [30]. These studies also demonstrated the retrograde contamination of separate sink waste traps which shared proximal connections in plumbing.",

Key design factors that influenced the environmental contamination were the design of the sink basin, speed of drainage of wastewater, and the location of the sink drains. In an experimental sink model with contaminated sink waste traps, sinks that rapidly drained and or had rear-draining sinks had less environmental contamination [32]. When sink basin drainage was immediately underneath the faucet, environmental contamination occurred regardless of the speed of the drainage but was 8 times greater with slow drainage. The importance of sink basin design was supported by a separate study, where sinks with faucets aligned behind a drain had a higher rate of contamination by P. aeruginosa compared to drains aligned directly with, in front of, or to the side of the faucet [33]. Similarly, slower drainage was found to be associated with a higher microbiological burden and drain positivity for contamination [33]. In addition, the presence of a drainage cover was shown to reduce contamination of countertops and healthcare worker (HCW)s\u2019 gowns in a study by Hajar et al. [34]. In the absence of a drain cover, 11% of countertops, 9% of gowns, and 6% of hands after hand washing demonstrated contamination with Gram-negative organisms compared to the contamination of 1% of countertops, 2% of gowns and 0% of hands with drainage cover.",

In an ICU outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) A. baumannii involving eight patients with clinical infections [36], microbiological sampling of the bedside physical environment demonstrated contamination with XDR A. baumannii. The outbreak was rapidly controlled after the institution of an intensified IPC bundle which included environmental disinfection, routine disinfection of devices, and terminal cleaning of environment and surfaces. Molecular analysis revealed diversity in the clones of A. baumannii, which suggested an ongoing evolution of the isolates and suggests that outbreak strains can quickly adapt over a short time period of 2\u20133 months [36]. In the second ICU outbreak investigation involving both OXA-48-producing Enterobacteriaceae and MDR A. baumannii [37], 13 OXA-48-producing Enterobacteriaceae carriers and 18 MDR A. baumannii carriers were identified. Initial outbreak response included in-depth bleach cleaning of the environment and a review of device disinfection protocols. Despite this, environmental surveillance cultures post terminal cleaning showed persistence of OXA-48 on sinks and mattresses. The outbreak was subsequently controlled with a combination of bleach environmental cleaning and hydrogen peroxide vapour.",

            "text": "Environmental contamination by colonized or infected patients is a key step in the onward transmission of MDRO, and understanding risk factors for environmental contamination may facilitate preventive IPC strategies. A recent study by Mody et al. [40] demonstrated that contamination of patients\u2019 hands with MDRO is frequent and correlates with contamination of high-touch surfaces. Patients who were colonized or infected with CRAB were also shown to have higher environmental contamination with clonal CRAB compared to patients who were not [39, 41]. The higher burden of MDRGN as usually observed in clinical infections, has been shown to increase environmental contamination [42, 43]. In a study of 26 patients colonized with KPC-producing CRE and environmental contamination, a group of 6 patients were identified as super-spreaders [43]. Majority of these super-spreaders had high rectal CRE concentrations, and faecal incontinence was the only patient-level risk factor for being a super-spreader. Although the median number of CRE colonies found on environmental sampling was 3.5 (IQR 1\u201311), the 6 patients (18% overall) had more than 50 KPC-producing colonies detected in the environment. The term super-spreader has been used to describe a highly infectious person who transmits an agent of diseases to a disproportionately large number of individuals often via environmental contamination. Lerner et al. in their study of the transmission of KPC-producing CRE identified a group of infected/colonized patients (18%) in whose vicinity the environmental load of the MDRO was high (80%) and classified them as super-spreaders [44]. The status of a super-spreader, however, is not constant. When the rectal concentration of CRE changed, the degree of environmental contamination was also noted to change. These findings stress the importance of early identification and physical separation of MDRO carriers to reduce environmental contamination and prevent onward transmission.",

In an experiment, test surfaces including over-bed table, different materials including vinyl, stainless steel, Formica, and cloth, were inoculated with CR K. pneumoniae, E. coli and Enterobacter species [46] to evaluate survivability of organisms up to 72 h.

Equipment implicated in these studies include the Velcro of blood pressure cuffs, positioning pillow, ice machine and a tea dispenser. The Velcro of the BP cuff was implicated in an outbreak of two clones of CRAB among ICU patients [48]. In another report, an outbreak of blaKPC-2 CR K. pneumoniae involving 105 patients in a university hospital was traced back to a positioning pillow and was observed to persist for 21 months [49]. Hospitality equipment may also be a source in an outbreak. One such example would be the discovery of an ice machine as the source of an ongoing CRAB outbreak uncovered incidentally while investigating a CR K. pneumoniae outbreak [50]. The investigators demonstrated clonal relatedness of the CRAB isolates from three patients, one HCW, and the ice machine water outlet, which stresses the importance of dedicated IPC strategies for ice machines and other hospitality equipment [51]. In a report from Japan, a cold tea dispenser was also involved in a metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (MBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae outbreak [52]. The outbreak which involved diverse species of IMP-1 producing Enterobacteriaceae including K. pneumoniae, E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterobacter aerogenes, terminated after the removal of the tea dispenser [52].",

Air environment of the patient has been implicated as a possible vector in the spread of MDRO [57]. Biological aerosols can be detected in the air either in the form of nuclei droplets (water or body fluids) or as aggregate microorganisms associated with dry particles. The dry form is likely to be the cause of the spread of healthcare-associated pathogens, including MDRGN [58]. The smaller the particle, the longer they remain suspended in the air and thus get widely distributed, especially in the hospital environment where air movement is uncontrolled. Survival of Gram-negative bacteria in the air depends on bacterial species, particle size and climatic factors such as temperature and humidity. In most studies Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. have been shown to survive for a considerable period of time [59].",

The results of the studies were mixed, with 5 studies demonstrating air contamination surrounding colonized or infected A. baumannii patients and 2 studies showing no association (Thailand [60] and Maryland, USA [64]). The difference seen in these studies could be attributed to the climatic differences, differing IPC practices (close circuit suctioning of ventilated patients), and the difference in methodologies.

Most of the studies were not designed to show direct transmission of pathogens from the air. Even though the design and conduct of such studies could be resource-intensive, this could be one of the focus of future research. Additionally, more research in identifying the ideal methods for pathogen identification in the air environment is much needed. Future research could include air microbiome analysis, potentially compared with classical microbiological methods, in identifying the role of air environment in persistence and transmission of nosocomial pathogens.",

Environmental contamination with MDRGN is significant in the outbreak and non-outbreak settings. The aqueous environment seems to be the biggest reservoir for MDRGN in the hospital environment and maybe a source of MDRGN outbreaks and persistence in the endemic setting. This may in part, be due to the difficulties in eradicating MDRGN from the plumbing systems. More research is needed in identifying the optimal IPC strategy to prevent MDRGN transmission from the aqueous environment to patients. Dry environmental surfaces and medical equipment seem to be associated more with Gram-positive and non-fermenting Gram-negative organisms than Enterobacteriaceae [70]. A. baumanii was the primary Gram-negative organisms associated with contamination of dry surfaces and subsequent transmission to patients.",
