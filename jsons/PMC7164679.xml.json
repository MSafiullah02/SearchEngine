            "text": "Following the first reports of an outbreak of an acute respiratory syndrome in China in\nDecember 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified (1, 2). As of March 14, 2020, over 140,000 cases were\nreported worldwide with over 5,400 deaths, surpassing the combined number of cases and\ndeaths of two previously emerging coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (3). The disease caused by this\nvirus, COVID-19, is characterized by a range of symptoms, including fever, cough,\ndyspnoea and myalgia in most cases (2). In severe cases, bilateral lung involvement with\nground-glass opacity is the most common chest computed tomography (CT) finding (4). Similarly to the 2002/2003\noutbreak of SARS, the severity of COVID-19 disease is associated with increased age\nand/or a comorbidity, although severe disease is not limited to these risk groups (5). However, despite the large\nnumber of cases and deaths, limited information is available on the pathogenesis of this\nvirus infection. Two reports on the histological examination of the lungs of three\npatients showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), pulmonary edema and hyaline\nmembrane formation, indicative of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as\ncharacteristic syncytial cells in the alveolar lumen (6, 7), similar to findings during the 2002/2003 outbreak of\nSARS-CoV (8). The pathogenesis of\nSARS-CoV infection was previously studied in a non-human primate model (cynomolgus\nmacaques) where aged animals were more likely to develop disease (9\u201313). In the current study, SARS-CoV-2 infection was\ncharacterized in the same animal model and compared with infection with MERS-CoV and\nhistorical data on SARS-CoV (9,\n10, 12).",

Environmental sampling indicated the presence of low levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA\non surfaces through both direct contact (hands) and indirect contamination within the\nisolator (Table S2).

Recent studies in human cases have shown that presymptomatic and\nasymptomatic cases can also shed virus (14, 15). Increased age did not affect disease outcome, but\nthere was prolonged viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract of aged animals.\nProlonged shedding has been observed in both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV patients (16, 17). Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 shedding in our\nasymptomatic model, peaked early in the course of infection, similar to what is seen in\nsymptomatic patients (16). Also,\nSARS-CoV-2 antigen was detected in ciliated epithelial cells of nasal mucosae at day 4\np.i., which was not seen for SARS-CoV (10) or MERS-CoV infections (this manuscript) in this\nanimal model. Viral tropism for the nasal mucosa fits with efficient respiratory\ntransmission, as has been seen for influenza A virus (18). This early peak in virus shedding for SARS-CoV-2\nis similar to influenza virus shedding (19) and may explain why case detection and isolation\nmay not be as effective for SARS-CoV-2 as it was for the control of SARS-CoV (20). SARS-CoV-2 was primarily\ndetected in tissues of the respiratory tract, however SARS-CoV-2 RNA was also detectable\nin other tissues such as intestines, in line with a recent report (21). Similar results regarding viral shedding and\ntissue and cell tropism were recently also reported following SARS-CoV-2 inoculation in\nrhesus macaques. However, unlike in our model, SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques\ndoes result in transient respiratory disease and weight loss (22, 23).",

In this\nnon-human primate model, SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in respiratory epithelial\ncells throughout the respiratory tract, including nasal cavity, bronchi, bronchioles,\nand alveoli. Replication in the upper respiratory tract fits with efficient transmission\nbetween hosts, while replication in the lower respiratory tract fits with the\ndevelopment of lung disease. An in-depth comparison of infection with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV\nand SARS-CoV-2 in this model may identify key pathways in the pathogenesis of these\nemerging viruses. This study provides a novel infection model which will be critical in\nthe evaluation and licensure of preventive and therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2\ninfection for use in humans, as well as evaluating the efficacy of repurposing species\nspecific existing treatments, such as pegylated interferon (12).",
