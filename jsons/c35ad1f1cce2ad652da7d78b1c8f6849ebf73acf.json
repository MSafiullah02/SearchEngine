However, for duck enteritis virus (DEV), which is an unassigned member of the family Herpesviridae, little information is available about the function of the two proteins. In this study, the Cterminus of DEV UL26 protein (designated UL26c), which contains the whole of UL26.5, was expressed, and the recombinant UL26c protein was used to immunize BALB/c mice to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAb). The mAb 1C8 was generated against DEV UL26 and UL26.5 proteins and used subsequently to map the epitope in this region. Both the mAb and its defined epitope will provide potential tools for further study of DEV.",

These peptides were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blotting analysis using mAb 1C8 to identify the epitope. A linear motif, 520 IYYPGE 525 , which was located at the C-terminus of the DEV UL26 and UL26.5 proteins, was identified by mAb 1C8. The result of the ELISA showed that this epitope could be recognized by DEV-positive serum from mice. The 520 IYYPGE 525 motif was the minimal requirement for reactivity, as demonstrated by analysis of the reactivity of 1C8 with several truncated peptides derived from the motif. Alignment and comparison of the 1C8-defined epitope sequence with those of other alphaherpesviruses indicated that the motif 521 YYPGE 525 in the epitope sequence was conserved among the alphaherpesviruses.",

            "text": "Herpesviruses exist widely in nature. The genomes of herpesviruses consist of linear double-stranded DNA; they differ in size (from approximately 124 to 235 kb), sequence arrangement and base composition [1] , and vary significantly with respect to the presence and arrangement of inverted and directly repeated sequences. The genomes of most of the alphaherpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) [2] and Marek's disease virus 1 (MDV-1) [3] , encode more than 70 proteins; some of these proteins are not essential for the replication of the viruses. Only limited information is available about the structures and functions of these 70 proteins, although some studies of the antigenic determinants of the glycoproteins have been reported [4, 5] . Three types of capsid, named A-, B-, and C-capsids, are needed in the assembly of HSV-1 [6] . B-capsids lack DNA but may be the important intermediates in virus assembly [7] [8] [9] [10] . The unique feature of B-capsids is the presence of an abundant core protein, named scaffolding protein ICP35 (VP22a) [6, [11] [12] [13] , which is encoded by the in-frame gene UL26. 5 . This protein is present in the B-capsids of the HSV-1 assembly but is absent after the completion of DNA encapsidation and is not found in the mature virion [14] .",

The DEV establishes an asymptomatic carrier state in waterfowl in the course of infection, and it is only detectable during the intermittent shedding period of the infection [18] . Currently, only limited information is available on the genomic sequence and encoded proteins of DEV; therefore the development of diagnostic methods based on virus detection is difficult.

Subsequently, we generated a monoclonal antibody (mAb) (named 1C8) against DEV UL26 by vaccination of mice with a recombinant UL26c prime and DEV particle boost. Finally, we identified an epitope in the DEV UL26 protein which was recognized by the mAb 1C8. These results will provide a basic understanding of the structure, function and localization of the DEV UL26 protein and UL26.5 protein.

Western blotting showed that the peptide F2 (432-577aa) was recognized by mAb 1C8 ( Figure  3A ). The further screening results showed that both F2-2 (471-525aa) and F2-3 (511-577aa) could react with mAb 1C8, while F2-1 (432-485aa) failed to be recognized ( Figure 3A ). These results indicated that the overlapping sequence shared by F2-2 and F2-3 may contain the epitope recognized by mAb 1C8. Hence, to define the epitope defined by mAb 1C8 in the UL26 protein more precisely, a series of truncated peptides (from F4 to F 14; Figure 2 ) that were deleted successively from the amino or carboxyl terminuses of the overlapping fragment were expressed, respectively, for subsequent screening of mAb 1C8. The results showed that the mAb 1C8 reacted with peptides from F4 (511-525aa) to F12 (520-525aa) ( Figure 3B and Figure 3C ), but not with F13 (519-524aa) and F14 (521-525aa) ( Figure 3C ). Therefore, we considered that the motif 520 IYYPGE 525 is the defined minimal epitope in the UL26 protein of the DEV Clone-03 strain that is recognized by mAb 1C8, because deletion of I 520 or E 525 destroyed the binding of the GST fusion peptides by mAb 1C8. In addition, the results were confirmed further by ELISA ( Figure 3D ).",

The capsid of HSV-1 is found in the mature virions and in the nuclei of infected cells from which they originate. There are three distinct types of capsid, A-, B-and C-capsids, in infected cells [6] . The B-capsids of HSV-1 contain a large amount of the scaffolding protein (the product of the UL26.5 gene), and smaller amounts of VP24 and VP21, the products of the UL26 gene. The UL26 and UL26.5 genes are expressed as 3'-coterminal transcripts, and the promoter for the UL26.5 gene is located within the coding region of the UL26 gene in HSV-1 [27] [28] [29] . The UL26 gene encodes a self-cleaved protease that generates the capsid proteins VP21 and VP24 [30] . Cleavage of the UL26 and UL26.5 proteins is not required for capsid assembly, but the cleavage event is essential for DNA encapsidation [31] . The UL26.5 gene encodes the scaffold protein VP22a [27] , which has been linked to a family of proteins named infected-cell protein 35 (ICP35). The VP22a is the most abundant protein found in the B-capsid and may form the scaffold of the HSV-1 B-capsid [32] . The B-capsid is similar to the capsid found in infectious HSV-1 particles, except that it lacks DNA. The cavity of the B-capsid is occupied instead by a proteinaceous core Table 1 . The bars represent peptides of the truncated DEV UL26 proteins. The peptides that were negative in western blotting and ELISA with mAb 1C8 are shown in gray and the peptides that were positive in western blotting and ELISA with mAb 1C8 are shown in pink. that is removed when DNA enters [32] . The UL26 proteinase cleaves the products of the UL26.5 gene, and itself, at a site 25 amino acids from the C terminus of its product [27] . DEV is an unassigned member in the family Herpesviridae and, to date, there has been no report of the structure and function of proteins UL26 and UL26.5 in DEV. It has been reported that the genes UL26 and UL26.5 in DEV are similar to their homologues in other alphaherpesviruses [20] . It has been speculated that they have similar functions in viral infection and replication to those of HSV-1 and other alphaherpesviruses.",

Interestingly, six bands were detected in DEVinfected CEFs in western blotting analysis using mAb 1C8 in this study ( Figure 1B) . These may have originated from cleavage by the products of the UL26 gene. Figure 6 shows the proteins that are predicted to originate from the products of the DEV UL26 and UL26.5 by the alignment of the homologous in HSV-1. The DEV UL26 gene encodes a deduced protein of 707 amino acids [20] . Comparison of the amino acids in DEV UL26 with the homologous in HSV-1 showed that DEV UL26 contains two sites. The release site (R) was at amino acids 281 and 282, and the maturational site (M) was at amino acids 677 and 678. Self-cleavage by UL26 may yield the proteolytically active VP24-like protein and VP21-like protein ( Figure 6 ) [30] , which are approximately 31 kD and 43 kD, respectively. The UL26.5 gene is in frame with UL26; therefore, the UL26.5-encoded proteins possess the same M site as the Figure 4 Reactivity of the identified epitope (F12: 520 IYYPGE 525 ) with antibodies against DEV.

It was demonstrated that the minimal sequence of the epitope defined by mAb 1C8 appeared to be 520 IYYPGE 525 , because any deletion of residues from either end of 520 IYYPGE 525 destroyed the ability of mAb 1C8 to bind. Comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences of the identified epitope with those of another 14 alphaherpesviruses revealed that the C-terminus of the linear B-cell epitope 521 YYPGE 525 is conserved among the selected alphaherpesviruses, except PRV, VZV and ILTV. It has been reported previously that the motif YYPGE is conserved in the scaffold proteins of alphaherpesviruses [33] . It was reported that deletion of a 9amino acid motif from the HSV-1 UL26.5, comprising amino acids 143 to 151, which contained the sequence YYPGE, did not affect the formation of capsids in vitro but had a specific effect on incorporation of the portal. This indicated that this deletion had blocked DNA packing but had not interfered with the assembly of Bcapsids [33, 34] . Therefore, the 9-amino acid motif that contains YYPGE is required for the formation of portalcontaining capsids in HSV-1-infected cells, and it is essential for the production of infectious virus [34] . However, in DEV, the function of the motif needs further investigation.",

The absence of neutralizing activity against DEV might indicate that this region has low immunogenicity or, more probably, that this region is not exposed on the surface of the virion. Indeed, the products of the HSV-1 UL26 gene are components of viral capsids, which are located inside of the viral tegument and envelope, while the products of the UL26.5 gene are components of B-capsids [28] . The products encoded by the two genes show predominantly nuclear localization within infected cells [35] . The B-capsids are accumulated in the nucleus prior to viral DNA encapsidation [36] and the predominant component of B-capsids is the product of the UL26.5 gene, which also contains the sequences of the epitope defined by 1C8.",
