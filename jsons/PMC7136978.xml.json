            "text": "The Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) is the most threatened wild feline in the world [1]. It is considered \u2018critically endangered\u2019 [2] and it is located only in two small isolated metapopulations in Southern Spain, the Do\u00f1ana area and Sierra Morena [3]. The progressive disappearance of these animals in the past decades has been attributed to decreases in the populations of their main prey, the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), due to myxomatosis, traps and hunting [4], [5], [6]. Nowadays, the Iberian lynx is threatened by the fragmentation and loss of its habitat [7], estimating a total population under 200 individuals [3]. The conservation of this European large wild cat is of great concern to the European Union authorities who are given large amounts of funds for its conservation. The causes of \u2018non-natural\u2019 mortality (prompted by human intervention) of the Iberian lynx have been thoroughly studied during the past decades [8], but there are no references of mortality by diseases or necropsy findings. Little is known about diseases and pathology that affect the Iberian lynx; there are only a few publications about tuberculosis [9], [10], [11] and parasites [12], [13], [14] in the Iberian lynx, and there are no previous reports concerning histopathological findings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the histopathological status of the peripheral lymphoid tissues and thymus of Iberian lynxes necropsied between 1998 and 2003 in relation to other pathologies found in the animals.",

This made a total of 17 very different animals including females (n=8) and males (n=9), age range from 10 months to 16 years, wild (n=14) and captive (n=3), from different populations (15 from the Do\u00f1ana population and two from the Sierra Morena population), and different causes of death (mainly trauma, n=11, caused by road accidents, traps\u2026) (Table 1\n). The presence of infectious agents in the dead animals was investigated from tissue samples or carcass fluids, whenever possible, by PCR or serology depending on the availability of the samples.

Immunohistochemistry (streptavidin\u2013biotin complex peroxidase method) was carried out on deparaffined sections after a high temperature antigen unmasking protocol (in a pressure cooker, sections were immersed in citrate buffer pH 6.0 and boiled for 2 min). The primary antibodies used were: rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-CD3, pan-T cell marker (DAKO A452, dilution 1/100, incubation overnight 4 \u00b0C); mouse monoclonal antibody anti-CD79, mature B cells marker (clone HM57, DAKO M7051, dilution 1/10, incubation overnight 4 \u00b0C); mouse monoclonal antibody clone MAC 387 myeloid/histiocyte antigen (DAKO M0747, dilution 1/200, incubation overnight 4 \u00b0C); and mouse monoclonal antibody anti-CD68 macrophage (clone PG-M1) (DAKO M0876, dilution 1/20, incubation overnight 4 \u00b0C). M. tuberculosis, CD79, MAC387 and CD68 sections were subsequently incubated with anti-mouse biotinylated secondary antibody (Dako E04233, dilution 1:200, 30 min at room temperature). CD3 sections were subsequently incubated with with anti-rabbit biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories BA1000, 1:400, 30 min at room temperature). Next, all the slides were incubated with streptavidin conjugated with peroxidase (Zymed P50242, 1:400, 30 min, at room temperature). All washes and dilutions were made with Tris-buffered-saline (TBS) (pH 7.4). The slides were developed with a chromogen solution containing 3-3\u2032 diaminobenzidine tetrachloride (Sigma Chemical Co. D5059) and H2O2 in distilled water and counterstained in hematoxylin (Sigma GH5-2-16). Negative control slides were used by substituting the primary antibody by TBS. Evaluation of the leucocyte populations labeled with each antibody was made by two observers simultaneously and scored as increased, normal, mild decreased, moderately decreased and severely decreased. For immunohistochemical validation of the antibodies to the Iberian lynx tissues, healthy domestic cat tissues, with known reactivity for the antibodies employed, were used as positive controls.",

The spleen was the lymphoid organ in which the cellular depletion (number of follicles and cellular density) was more evident and frequent (Table 3). It was not possible to carry out the histological evaluation due to autolysis in two cases. One case did not show immune depletion with H&E and the rest of the animals studied presented some degree of lymphoid depletion (7 mild, 5 moderate and 2 severe). The grade of LD per animal did not depend on the origin of the animal, whether it was free or captive, or the cause of death, and it increased with age: mild LD was found mainly in young or young-adult animals while moderate and severe LD was more frequent in aged animals. LD was also severe in two Iberian lynxes suffering tuberculosis (Cases 16 and 17). Hyaline substance deposition was commonly observed in lymphoid follicles with evident lymphoid depletion (Fig. 1\n). Besides traumatic lesions, the most interesting histopathological findings were pneumonia, epithelial neoplasms and tuberculosis (Table 1). Five individuals (Cases 6, 11, 12, 16 and 17) presented neoplasia (squamous cell carcinoma of the skin and urinary bladder \u2018in situ\u2019 carcinoma) and/or tuberculosis (M. bovis, PCR). In one of the cases with tuberculosis (Case 11), the granulomas were only found in the lung (tuberculous primary complex); in another case with disseminated tuberculosis (Case 16) the main tuberculosis lesions were found in liver and lymph nodes, although small granulomas were also observed in the lung; another animal with a history of blindness (since 3 months of age) with generalized tuberculosis (Case 17), granulomas of tuberculosis were found in lung, liver, lymph nodes, both adrenal glands, and in both ocular globes (bilateral tuberculos granulomatous uveitis). In all granulomas acid-fast bacilli were histologically identified by the Ziehl\u2013Neelsen technique and immunohistochemistry. Multinucleated cells (2\u20135 nuclei) were observed in the granulomas.",

Spleen was the lymphoid organ with more evident hypocellularity and decreases of CD3 and CD79 populations (T and B lymphocytes). B cells were decreased in many cases in the spleen and lymph nodes but normal or increased in MALT. Minor reduction in T and B subpopulations, together with increases of macrophages (MAC387 and CD68 positive-cells) in lymph nodes and MALT samples could have been influenced by local pathologies (i.e. intestinal parasitic infestations in mesenteric lymph nodes and intestinal MALT). The increased number of macrophages and dendritic cells (MAC387 and CD68 positive cells) found in the splenic red pulp and lymph node medulla of tissues with T and B cell reductions indicates a proliferation of these cell types that remains unexplained although it could represent a compensating situation. T and B cell depletion and increase macrophage proliferation has been indicated in lymphoid tissues of domestic cats with experimental feline infectious peritonitis (Feline coronavirus) [15]. Follicular hyalinosis in the center of depleted follicles is a common histopathological finding in domestic cats with panleukopenia (feline parvovirus, FPV) [19].",

It is known that devastating diseases (late generalization of tuberculosis) and metastasic tumors can cause depression of the immune system [19]. In our opinion, the presentation of these neoplastic and infectious diseases were promoted by the defects in the immune system although the alternative hypothesis is equally valid. The coexistence in the same animal of pulmonary tuberculosis and squamous cells carcinoma of the skin and, in another case, the coexistence of two different epithelial carcinomas (skin and urinary transitional epithelium), could be coincidental, but also could be the result of a immunodeficiency status. To our knowledge this is the first report of any kind of tumor in the Iberian lynx. There are several publications describing tuberculosis in the Iberian lynx [9], [10], [11]. In two of our three cases, the primary pulmonary lesions indicate that the contamination was probably by inhalation from contaminated food as it has been indicated in a previous case of tuberculosis in the Iberian lynx and in other wild felids [10], [20]. In the remaining case, the distribution and size of the lesions do not confirm an inhalation route of contamination and suggest a digestive origin of the tuberculosis. Multinucleated cells (2\u20135 nuclei) observed in the granulomas did not display the typical aspect of Langhans' cells as in other species infected with M. bovis\n[19].

In the previous report about the pathology of one Iberian lynx with tuberculosis [10], both adrenal glands were also affected. This fact could indicate a special predisposition of these animals to have adrenal tuberculosis, since adrenal glands are not a common site for tuberculosis lesions in other animal species [19]. Ocular tuberculosis is an uncommon but documented finding in the domestic cat [21] that has never been referred to in wild felids and could be also a consequence of an immune deficiency status. In our case, the early appearance of blindness (3-month-old) seems to indicate an ocular primoinfection rather than a dissemination, possibly due to contact with contaminated food. Nevertheless, the high prevalence of tuberculosis in our series of cases can be also influenced by the high prevalence of the disease in wild and domestic ungulates living in the same areas [11].",

In fact, the histopathological findings of the present study are coincident with those found in cats infected with immunosupppressive viruses, specially in non-acute diseases or carrier stages [19], [22]. Stress should also be taken into account as a possible origin of the immune depletion but only in the captive animals (n=4). Finally, there are several reasons to consider a primary immune system defect due to the inbreeding of the Iberian lynx. Evidences for reduced genetic variability in the Iberian lynx, due to the low number of individuals separated in two small subpopulations, have been recently published [7].",
