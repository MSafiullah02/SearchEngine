Some of these proteins trigger signals to kidnap cell organelles and factors which will form a new macro-structure, the virus factory, that acts as a physical scaffold for viral replication and assembly. We are only beginning to envisage the extraordinary complexity of these interactions, whose characterisation is a clear experimental challenge for which we now have powerful tools. Conventional study of infection kinetics using virology, biochemistry and cell biology methods can be followed by genome-scale screening and global proteomics. These are important new technologies with which we can identify the cell factors used by viruses at different stages in their life cycle. Light microscopy, electron microscopy and electron tomography, together with labelling methods for molecular mapping in situ, show immature viral intermediates, mature virions and recruited cell elements in their natural environment. This chapter describes how these methods are being used to understand the cell biology of viral morphogenesis and suggests what they might achieve in the near future.",

Restricted by their own limited genetic repertoire, viruses need to use a number of cell factors for genome replication and morphogenesis. Identification of these factors is essential for understanding the virus morphogenetic processes that often take place in intracellular structures known as viral inclusions, virosomes or viral factories. Viruses are generally thought to build these structures to recruit and concentrate viral and cell factors needed for replication and assembly; they are able to modify a variety of cell organelles and to create new inter-organelle contacts ( Fig. 14.1 ). In the mammalian cell, virus assembly can start inside the nucleus, in association with components of the secretory pathway (Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum or ER), at different points in the endocytic pathway (endosomes, multivesicular bodies or MVB) or at the plasma membrane. Mitochondria and cytoskeletal elements are present in the factories built by many different viruses.",

This strategy appears to allow viruses to generate progeny with maximum efficiency in the use of cell resources. It is also thought that viruses can use these 1 Cell organelles used for viral morphogenesis. The cell nucleus is used by herpes-and papillomaviruses; corona-, bunya-and flaviviruses use components of the secretory pathway such as the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi; togaviruses and the human cytomegalovirus use components of the endo-lysosomal pathway such as endosomes, multivesicular bodies and lysosomes; the African swine fever virus (ASFV) and poxviruses assemble in aggresome-like structures; assembly sites of retroviruses at the plasma membrane might be connected with a cytoplasmic factory. Viruses modify endomembranes, recruit mitochondria and cytoskeleton, and create new inter-organelle contacts scaffolds to protect themselves from cellular antiviral defences [2] . Viral factories were first described for large DNA viruses such as the African swine fever virus (ASFV) and the poxviruses; we now know that many DNA and RNA viruses build factories in the cytosol, in the nucleus, or both. Due to our limited knowledge of cell nucleus organisation, characterisation of nuclear viral factories is only beginning. In contrast, viral factories assembled in the cytosol are being studied extensively and there are many reports on their architecture and activities. Inside these cytosolic factories, morphogenesis of new viruses begins with the transport of replicated genomes from the structures that harbour the replication complexes (RC) to the assembly sites. Depending on the virus, a number of maturation steps will follow (see Chap. 13 for details) before new viral particles are ready for delivery and propagation.",

Microarrays are being used to identify mRNA transcription patterns in different phases of the virus life cycle. DNA gene chips detect differences in gene expression between uninfected and virus-infected cells and at different infection stages. Gene data bases are then useful for associating the genes identified with specific cell pathways [4, 5] . High-throughput screening based on RNA interference (RNAi) is another category of methods that analyse gene expression patterns. RNAi is an RNA-dependent gene silencing process within living cells that is often exploited to study the function of genes. This emerging technology is used to study how viruses interact with their hosts at the molecular level. Analysis at various times post-infection has identified a number of cell factors potentially involved in viral morphogenesis, for example for dengue [6] , influenza [7] and retroviruses [8] . RNAi may be used for large-scale screens that systematically shut down each gene in the cell. Studies using this approach have shown a requirement for cell factors such as the ESCRT machinery for assembly of the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV [9] .",

            "text": "The group of techniques termed proteomics includes powerful methods to study protein-protein interactions. The yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay system remains one of the most amenable techniques and is widely used to search for virus-host interactions. Y2H works by expressing two candidate proteins in the yeast cell. Bait and prey proteins are fused either to a promoter-specific DNA-binding domain or to a transcription activation domain. Interaction between the two proteins in the yeast nucleus brings both domains together so that they can initiate expression of a reporter gene [10] . Individual bait proteins can be screened for interaction with a library of prey proteins. Genome-scale Y2H studies were used to identify 314 virushost interactions for HCV [11] 109 interactions for vaccinia virus [12] and nine for HIV-1 [13] . Similar techniques, such as the yeast three-hybrid system, can be used to study interactions between nucleic acids and proteins [14, 15] . This group of methods also includes pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays, and tandem affinity purification (TAP) tagging approaches, as well as protein identification by quantitative and semi-quantitative mass spectrometry. Whereas Y2H usually detects transient interactions, affinity-tag purification mass spectrometry shows stable, stoichiometric complexes. Since cell proteins often incorporate into viral particles, these techniques can be applied to the study of protein-protein interactions in the infected cell and in purified viral assembly intermediates [16] . This is the case of clathrin, for example, which was found in retrovirus particles; clathrin was only recently identified as one of the cell factors that facilitate accurate morphogenesis of several retroviruses [17] . Y2H technology also detected cell proteins that interfere with virus assembly and viral proteins that block them. This is the case of tetherin, first detected by proteomics and mass spectrometric protein identification as a cell factor that restricts retrovirus assembly [18] , and later confirmed as a restriction factor for a wide variety of enveloped viruses [19] . Viruses have several anti-tetherin proteins to counteract the effect of this factor [20] . The current challenge of high-throughput technologies is to develop more efficient informatics tools to accurately analyse the vast amount of information they can provide [21] . The next step in the characterisation of in-cell virus assembly pathways would be to study the specific roles of the factors identified in their natural environment; to do this, we must of course return to the infected cell. Functions can be tested by protein depletion or overexpression, by mutagenesis or by protein targeting with tags. To visualise key factors in infected cells, there are a variety of classical and novel microscopy techniques that will be described in the following sections.",

In immunofluorescence assays using antibodies to viral proteins and cell compartments, we can see where viral structural and scaffolding proteins (Chap. 11) concentrate to create the assembly sites. Light microscopy shows, for example, that the same virus can build distinct factories in different cell types, depending on specific characteristics of the cell ( Fig. 14.2a, b) . Functional viruses that express proteins fused with clonable fluorescent tags such as the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (see Sect. 14.3 for details) can be followed in live cells [24] . Video microscopy facilitates dynamic characterisation of the biogenesis of the factory and virus assembly in real time. Time course experiments with antibody-labelled permeabilised cells or video microscopy studies with GFP fusions in living cells are essential for selecting specific conditions, such as the best times p.i., for more detailed, higher resolution study by TEM. Electron microscopy generally uses ultra-thin sections of cells previously embedded in plastic resins after conventional fixation and dehydration; alternatively, cells are processed at low temperature after or upon fixation for optimal preservation of ultrastructure (see Chap. 3 for sample preparation details), or subjected to criofixation procedures such as high-pressure freezing prior to freeze substitution and embedding, or freeze-fracture analyses. With resolutions in the range of a few nanometers, cell TEM can show changes in shape and size of virus assembly intermediates in specific intracellular compartments [25, 26] (Fig. 14.2c, d) . TEM of infected cells shows that mitochondria, endomembranes and cytoskeleton often participate in organising the structure that supports viral assembly. To complete maturation and become infectious, immature viral particles must often travel within the factory to find specific cell factors. At late times post-infection, once virus progeny have been produced and must find their way out of the cell, the factory can be dismantled [1] .",

Given that eukaryotic cells are several microns in diameter, the ultra-thin sections are single planes of much larger structures. For conventional TEM, cells are fixed on culture plates and collected by low speed centrifugation, followed by sectioning of the pellet. In these conditions, cells preserve their morphology but present a variety of orientations ( Fig. 14.3a) ; analysis is therefore restricted to random, unique sections of cells, and scarce or non-randomly distributed elements can be missed completely. Oriented serial sections solve this problem (Fig. 14.3b ). By collecting all serial sections from each cell, all intracellular elements can be detected and studied. This strategy guarantees a complete analysis without missing any intracellular event of interest; immunofluorescence can assist by localising where viruses are assembled within a cell and thus, where cells should be sectioned for TEM [22] . The study of oriented serial sections is very informative and has revealed unreported contacts between cell organelles, RC and assembly sites, as well as the relationships of different viral intermediates with specific cell elements ( Fig. 14.3c ).",

With resolution values of~5 nm in the X and Y axes, these 3D reconstructions can show viruses in factories with considerable detail (Fig. 14. 3d, e). Resolution in the Z axis is limited, however, with values of~50-100 nm due to imperfections in the alignment process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) can also be used to visualise virus morphogenesis. These microscopes use a focused beam of high-energy electrons to generate a variety of signals at the surface of solid specimens. Samples are covered by a thin layer of metal and scanned with a primary source of electrons; secondary electrons are then released from the sample surface and collected by a detector. The signals derived from electron-sample interactions furnish information about the sample, including external morphology in 3D. Modern scanning electron microscopes can now provide resolutions as precise as 2-5 nm, near that achieved by cellular electron microscopy [28] . SEM images can show morphological changes in large virus particles during maturation in situ; this is the case, for example, of the giant mimivirus (Fig. 14.4a, b) . In lysed cells and isolated virus factories visualised by SEM, immature viruses are clearly distinguished at short (Fig. 14.4c) , whereas mature virions accumulate in the factory at longer times p.i.

Higher resolutions of~1 nm have been reported, as was the case of the budding HIV viral particles visualised by cryo-electron microscopy on the surface of intact human cells [31] . Both normal and aberrant budding events were visualised on the cell surface, suggesting that cellular and/or viral factors control the quality of virus assembly and maturation. A limitation of cellular tomography is that the maximum thickness of the sample must be <0.5 \u03bcm, whereas virus factories are larger; however, conventional TEM methods like those described above can help to select specific elements within cells for more detailed ET structural analysis. Thanks to ET, elusive structures have been visualised for the first time, such as the transfer of viral genomes from RC to assembly sites in dengue virus-infected cells [32] (Fig. 14.5a, b) . The morphogenesis of poxviruses is another good example; vaccinia virus (VV) assembly and architecture were the subject of numerous studies, but the organisation and biogenesis of immature and mature VV particles were not understood until the first ET studies were carried out [33, 34] . These analyses showed unprecedented remodelling of cell endomembranes during VV particle assembly (Fig. 14.5c, d) . Tomograms are analysed in detail in computational slices of 1-2 nm extracted from the original volumes (Fig. 14.5a) . As with serial sections in conventional TEM, the relevant information is contained in these single planes, whereas 3D representations are models used to summarise the most relevant features in the tomograms (see Chap. 3 for details). In summary, two main groups of methods are available for 3D studies of viral assembly. 3D reconstructions of serial sections by TEM or analysis of surface morphology by SEM will show the general organisation of the virus factory, the inter-organelle contacts, and changes in the cell compartments where viruses are formed. In contrast, electron tomography is more appropriate for studying individual viral particles and to obtain fine details of their maturation in situ.",

When immunolabelling proteins on cryosections, where cells have not been dehydrated and maintain their proteins in a natural hydrated state, the sensitivity of antibody detection is usually higher than that obtained when labelling sections of dehydrated, resin-embedded cells. Since the introduction of cryosectioning, the method has been improved and perfected [38, 39] . This approach allows colocalisation of nascent and maturing viral particles in specific cell compartments and the proteins being incorporated into assembling virus particles (Fig. 14.6b) . Although antibodies are usually very specific, information derived from these experiments is later confirmed in biochemical assays.",

The protein is detected in Golgi membranes (G) and normal functions, their movements and interactions with intracellular structures can be tracked in living cells (Fig. 14.6d ). In conjunction with the new generation of LM methods, we can even follow the assembly of individual virus particles at real time [41] . GFP is a relatively large molecule (27 kDa) and, since viral proteins have very strict structural requirements, fusion to GFP can produce loss of function. If this is the case, probes smaller than GFP could be a viable option. The group of smaller probes includes the fluorescent flavoprotein known as miniSOG, which is less than half the size of GFP [42] , or the smaller tetra-cysteine motifs, which are visualised after incubation with fluorescent biarsenical molecules such as ReAsH or FlAsH [43] .",

The complexity of the interactions inside infected cells can be extraordinary, as illustrated by the viruses known as virophages that parasitise the factory built by other viruses. Some images of cells co-infected by the giant mimivirus and the virophage \"Sputnik\" suggest that the small virophage not only uses the materials recruited by the mimivirus for its own replication, but might even hide inside the mimivirus particles to exit the cell [44] . We still do not know how organelles and materials are recruited or how replicated viral genomes are transported from RC to assembly sites. We do know, however, that viruses target their proteins to specific cell compartments, that some viruses use a cellular defence mechanism termed the aggresome response, and that signals related to organelle movement on cytoskeletal tracks could also be involved [1, 2] .

Virus factories and aggresomes both assemble at the MTOC, recruit mitochondria and cell chaperones, build a cage with vimentin filaments, and are maintained by the activity of dynein motors on microtubules. EM shows membranes, ribosomes, viral intermediates and fully assembled viruses inside the vimentin cage of the ASFV aggresome-like factory (Fig. 14.7b) .

The secretory pathway is the most common target for this virus-induced membrane remodelling, while the endocytic pathway also participates in some cases (Fig. 14.1) . The two pathways are closely related, in fact, and converge at the trans-Golgi compartment. Described in the literature with many different names, the membranous tubuloreticular structures (TBS) often detected in infected cells are indeed cubic membranes that consist of highly curved, 3D-folded lipid bilayers. Alterations in cholesterol metabolism are linked to the biogenesis of cubic membranes, used for assembly by some viruses such as the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus [49] . Other viruses depend on phosphatidylcholine synthesis, fatty acid synthesis or geranylation. The highly curved nature of cubic membranes, possibly induced by multiple interactions between replicase proteins, might assist virus budding. Virus replication often slows secretion, however, which means that viruses can interfere with membrane trafficking proteins and their regulation by small GTPases [2, 47] . Additional host factors involved in virus-induced membrane remodelling include the SNARE (soluble NSF attachment protein receptor) proteins, which are mediators of vesicle fusion used by the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the VAMP-associated proteins (VAP) that bind to SNARE and are used by hepatitis C virus, and the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport), which are essential for HIV assembly in the plasma membrane [19, 47, 50] .",

Many viruses and cell substructures are smaller than this and cannot be solved by LM. In recent years, several laboratories have developed a group of optical microscopy methods, termed super-resolution microscopy, that have improved spatial resolution by an order of magnitude over the diffraction limit [54] . Future improvements in microscopes, fluorescent probes and labelling chemistry will further refine the resolution of these methods, considerably narrowing the gap between light and electron microscopy. Using a variety of technical strategies, these new technologies have begun to provide insights into cell biology and virology. In particular, real-time imaging methods that track individual virus particles in living cells are being used to study virus assembly, and super-resolution microscopy has already defined interactions with cell factors during HIV-1 budding [55, 56] . In the near future, these microscopies will have an increasing impact in the field of virus morphogenesis.",

To date, two types of approaches have been reported, using photoconversion of fluorescent tags or metal-binding proteins. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) can be photoconverted by production of singlet oxygen from fluorescing proteins to generate dense osmiophilic precipitates that are visible in the electron microscope [57] . The resulting signals are diffuse and lack the resolution of particulate probes, although reasonable results have been obtained for proteins concentrated in cell organelles and in electron tomography [37, 42] . Metal-binding proteins were recently validated as clonable tags for EM in bacteria [58, 59] and mammalian cells [60] . These methods allow detection of intracellular proteins at high sensitivity and molecular scale resolution. To track protein molecules in CLEM, proteins can be double-tagged with a metal-binding peptide and a fluorescent probe. This will give us a new way to look inside cells and visualise where and how individual macromolecules come together to build viral particles.",

Relevant examples on what is being learned on the participation of host cell factors in virus assembly have been described in this chapter by focusing on studies with a few representative model systems. Future work must be accompanied by studies of how cells position their proteins and regulate organelle shape, size and movement. By understanding how viruses manipulate these processes, we will not only learn about viruses but also about cell architecture and compartmentalisation of functions.",
