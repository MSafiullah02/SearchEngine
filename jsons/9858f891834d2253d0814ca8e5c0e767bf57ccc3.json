            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (henceforth \u2017the coronavirus) outbreak has led to governments imposing strict restrictions on individual liberty in order to prevent the spread of this highly contagious and virulent pathogen. Such measures have included the closure of businesses, travel restrictions, isolation of confirmed cases, and the quarantine of individuals who have been exposed to the virus. Whilst no-one should doubt the urgency of the situation prompted by the coronavirus pandemic, the extension of emergency powers naturally raises concerns about whether their use will be compatible with human rights law. Individuals who wish to raise a legal objection to the use of restrictive measures that are sufficiently severe to constitute a deprivation of liberty may be able to do so by appealing to human rights law. In Europe, for example, they may appeal to one of the various statutes that incorporate the European Convention of Human Rights (EHCR) into domestic law. However, even human rights law does not afford complete precedence to the individual's right to liberty in the context of public health.",

First, the powers are only authorised in a declared \u2017transmission control period'. Such a period may be declared when the transmission of coronavirus constitutes a serious and imminent threat to public health in England, and the powers outlined in the schedule will be an effective way of delaying or preventing significant further transmission. 17 The UK declared the beginning of a \u2017transmission control period' on 10 th February 2020 (in accordance with the extant Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations at that time). 18 This condition should go some way to mitigating the EGE's concern that the state's extended power to restrict liberty in emergency coronavirus legislation will come to constitute a \u2017new normal'.",

A great deal of research is currently being performed to search for a vaccine that will afford protection against the devastating effects of Covid-19. Indeed, the development of an effective vaccine is a possible contender for an exit-strategy from the widespread public health restrictions that are currently enforced across the world. In that context, is important to note that neither the Regulations nor the CA authorize the imposition of compulsory treatment, including vaccination, in response to the coronavirus.",

However, if a vaccine proves to be the most viable exit strategy from our current predicament, the pandemic may yet require us to confront the question of whether compulsory vaccination could be a necessary and proportionate response to this public health threat, and how far we might be willing to revise existing limits to regulations that the Secretary of State may make in response to a pandemic threat.

The scope of the public health exception has been further clarified by judgements in the European Court of Human Rights, as I shall explain below. 6In this paper, I shall use the Coronavirus Act 2020 (CA) as a case study of how emergency legislation enacted in the context of a pandemic may conflict with human rights law enshrined elsewhere in domestic law. I shall begin by briefly outlining the key powers outlined in different legal instruments that are (or have been) operative in the public health context in England and Wales. In the second half of the paper, I shall consider how these powers might interact with Article 5(1) of the ECHR (incorporated into domestic law in the UK by virtue of the Human Rights Act 1998).To do so, I shall first outline key criteria that the European Court of Human Rights takes to delimit the scope of the public health exception to Article 5 rights, as clarified by the Court's Judgment in Enhorn vsSweden. 7  These criteria concern whether the the restrictions of liberty that the CA might authorise may be susceptible to challenge on the basis of failing to meet these criteria. Throughout, I focus on powers to detain,From this point, I shall refer to The Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 as amended by the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as \u2017the PHA'. The PHA lays much of the responsibility for controlling the spread of infectious disease at the door of Justices of the Peace (JoPs), magistrates (often laypeople) who are appointed by the crown. Section 45G of the PHA gives a JoP the power to impose various restrictions on an individual, \u2017P' if the JoP is satisfied that the following are true: a) P is or may be infected b)The infection or contamination is one which presents or could present significant harm to human health c) There is a risk that P might infect or contaminate others d) It is necessary to make the order in order to remove or reduce that risk The PHA also makes it clear that there should be some evidentiary basis for the JoP's belief that these things are true.

This constitutes a significant departure from the approach adopted in the Regulations that preceded the CA. Under the previous Regulations, a public health officer was defined as either a professionally registered public health consultant working within Public Health England, or a person working within Public Health England acting under the supervision of a registered consultant. 36 Moreover, in the Regulations, only the former kind of public health officer had the power to impose significant restrictions of liberty 37under the CA, all public health officers have these powers. I shall suggest below that this first feature of the CA arguably raises concerns about the proportionality and necessity of the restrictions that it might authorise, despite its ostensible commitment to these criteria. The second point I wish tohighlight here pertains to another feature that may also jeopardise the extent to which certain deprivations of liberty authorised by the CA might fall within the public health exception, as understood by the European Court of Human Rights. The feature in question is that there is no clear limit to the period of time for which an individual may be isolated under the CA. This is a significant departure from the PHA, which, by virtue of section 45L, imposes a 28-day time limit on detention, isolation, and quarantine orders that a JoP may impose. 38 As detailed above, under the CA, if it is Interestingly, the CA improves upon the preceding Regulations in this regard.",

            "text": "The determination of whether a particular restriction amounts to such a deprivation of liberty is not simply a matter of the form and duration of the restriction. Indeed, in its judgment on Austin vs UK (a case of a detention for several hours in a non-public health context), the European Court of Human Rights stated that the mere fact that detention has been imposed for a significant period is -. . . not in itself sufficient to However, even if a deprivation of liberty has occurred, there is still the further question of whether it might fall within the public heath exception to Article 5 rights mentioned in the introduction. Recall that this exception states that an individual may be deprived of their liberty to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, if that detention is in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law. The European Court of Human Rights clarified the scope of this exception in the case of Enhorn vs Sweden(2005).47  The case concerned an individual known to be infected with HIV who was subjected to involuntary isolation. As Robin Martyn explained in an insightful commentary on the case, the applicant argued that this restriction violated his Article 5(1) rights on two bases. First, it was not in accordance with the substantive and procedural requirements of domestic law, and second, it did not constitute a proportionate response to the need to prevent the spread of infectious disease, thus failing to meet the substantive provisions of Article 5. 48Although the first argument failed to convince the Court, the second succeeded. However, the reasoning behind each verdict is relevant to our discussion here. With regards to the first, although the Court held that the restrictions were in accordance with the requirements of domestic law in Sweden, it also stressed in its discussion of this argument that legal certainty is paramount in cases of deprivations of liberty; public health law must thus be clearly defined and foreseeable in its application.49  With regards to the second argument, the court emphasized thatHaving outlined the Court's reasoning on these matters, Martin goes on to assess the implications of this judgment for the extant version of the Public Health Act in England and Wales at that time, identifying important shortcomings in the Act.However, two years after the publication of her analysis, the Act underwent significant revisions, including the repeal of sections that were the focus of much of her analysis. Furthermore, Part 2A, which was included in the 2008 revisions of the PHA, addresses some of the shortcomings that Martin had previously highlighted. For instance, Martin argued that the absence of time limits on compulsory detention in the previous version of the act restricted the foreseeability of the application of this power, meaning that its use would likely fall foul of the requirement of legal certainty emphasized in the Enhorn judgment. 52 Yet, as noted above, the revised PHA incorporates a 28-day limit for some section 45G orders.",

In contrast, this obstacle remains in place in the context of the CA powers, since they can be invoked to detain individuals who are merely suspected of being potentially infectious, and it is possible that asymptomatic individuals may be infectious. This makes the application of the Enhorn judgment to interpreting the interaction of the coronavirus powers with Article 5(1) rights less straightforward. 63In view of the above considerations, it is clear that sensitive, evidence-based assessments of the necessity and proportionality of deprivations of liberty in the context of a novel pathogen require a great deal of public health expertise. To some extent, this was implicitly acknowledged in the Regulations, which limited the power to authorize significant restrictions of liberty (following a proportionality/necessity assessment) to registered public health consultants (and the Secretary of State), either of which would need to have \u2017reasonable grounds' for their beliefs regarding the necessity and proportionality of these matters. 64 However, the CA extends this authority to individuals who may lack the relevant degree of public health expertise; recall that public health officers who may authorize restrictions of liberty under this act need not be registered public heath consultants working within NHS England (in stark contrast to the Regulations), and that the CA also extends considerable powers in this regard to police constables and immigration officers. Crucially though, the circumstances that might give an individual lacking public health expertise \u2017reasonable grounds' for believing that62  Enhorn v.Sweden  at 36 and 44. Green makes a similar point with regards to lockdown measures. See Greene, 'States Should Declare a State of Emergency Using Article 15 ECHR to Confront the Coronavirus Pandemic'. 64 HM Government, The Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020, s5-8.depriving a given individual of their liberty would be necessary and proportionate for achieving a public health benefit, may not provide such grounds for someone with a high degree of relevant professional expertise.Of course, It might be claimed that there can be an \u2017absence of arbitrariness' in the determinations of individuals lacking high degrees of expertise in this context, in so far as they make their judgments about what constitutes such reasonable grounds to their best of their ability. However, whilst this may plausibly lead us not to sanction non-expert individuals who make inaccurate assessments of these matters, this does not entail that deprivations of liberty based on non-expert assessments should be regarded as necessary and proportionate in the sense that is relevant for article 5(1)rights. Poorly informed assessments of necessity and proportionality performed by individuals who lack relevant expertise about how to make such judgments can only be said to involve an absence of arbitrariness in only a significantly attenuated sense.",
