Input refers to the institutional and financial resources for education, human resources, supplies, medications, vaccines, diagnostic capacity, and services available. Process refers to the use of those resources, including peer group expectations of professionalism. Outcomes generally include measures of morbidity, mortality, and functional status of the patient and the population. Defining and measuring achievements of national health objectives and targets, the methods of financing services, and the efficiency of organization help to determine quality. Training, supply, and distribution of health personnel are all determinants of access to and quality of care. Continuous and adequate availability of essential preventive, diagnostic, and treatment services, as well as accountability and internal methods of promoting standards, are all elements of the quality of a health service for the individual, the population as a whole, and groups within the population with special needs.",

The drug thalidomide, widely used as an antinauseant and sleeping pill for pregnant women in Europe, Canada, and Australia in the 1960s, was not approved by the US FDA. This drug was found to cause large numbers of serious birth deformities leading to its being banned in most countries. Controls of blood and blood products have been strengthened since the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C by contaminated blood products in the 1980s. The responsibility of this regulatory function is well illustrated by the 1995 criminal conviction of several senior health officials in France for failing to stop the use of blood products contaminated with HIV in the mid-1980s. Concern regarding possible carcinogenic effects of silicone breast implants led to legal action and greater controls of all implantable products.

The global consensus on MDGs, set out by the United Nations (UN) in 2001, indicates progress in the epidemiological understanding of realities in low-income countries and the need for consensus over common targets. Since then, attention has been directed towards the epidemiological shift to NCDs, which are the most common causes of death in low- and medium-income countries. Thus there is a double burden of infectious, nutrition, maternal, and child priorities, alongside the NCDs. The increasing adoption of vaccines such as Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and rotavirus alongside the standard diphtheria\u2013pertussis\u2013tetanus (DPT), poliomyelitis (polio), and measles\u2013mumps\u2013rubella (MMR) vaccines provides new possibilities to control the major infectious disease killers of children. New technologies such as the advent of antiretroviral treatment for HIV have led to startlingly successful improvements in the quality of life and longevity of HIV/AIDS patients, and the prevention of onward transmission of HIV from mothers to babies and sexual partners. The WHO and many other global health stakeholders continue this work and produce analyses to contribute to policy making based on economic epidemiological evidence.

Screening for cervical cancer by Pap smears is recommended annually for high-risk groups, and every 2 or 3 years for other adult women (Box 15.3\n). Screening will remain vital for many years to come as the HPV vaccine comes into general use, and as its cost is reduced, but its protective effect for individual and herd immunity will not replace the need for ongoing screening for this very common cancer. HPV vaccine is also being recommended for all boys to prevent oral and anogenital cancers and HPV transmission to girls.BOX 15.3Technology for Prevention of Cervical, Colorectal, Liver, Stomach and Lung CancersCancer of the cervix is the second most common cancer among women worldwide, with about 500,000 new cases and 250,000 deaths worldwide annually. Approximately 80 percent of cases occur in low-income countries, where cervical cancer is the second commonest cancer in women (WHO, 2012).In the USA, and other industrialized countries, the incidence and mortality of cancer of the cervix have been going down steadily since the introduction of Papanicolaou (Pap) smear testing. Cervical cancer incidence declined during the period 1999\u20132008 by 2.3 percent per year and mortality declined by 1.9 percent per year an estimated 12,170 cases of invasive cervical cancer diagnosed in the USA with 4220 deaths in 2012.Prevention of cancer of the cervix has until recently mainly focused on Pap smears to detect the disease while still in a precancerous (cancer in situ) phase, and this procedure reduced rates dramatically over the latter part of the twentieth century. The newly developed and highly effective vaccines against key strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) is now being used in routine immunization of young girls and more recently boys as well. The high cost of the vaccine precludes its rapid diffusion to most parts of the world but its use is spreading and being included in immunization programs funded by donor agencies in sub Saharan Africa. The vaccine should, in principle, also be used by adult women, in addition to continuation of routine Pap smear testing.In the past decade, evidence of HPV as the cause of cancer of the cervix and the presence of HPV in uncircumcised men has brought circumcision back to professional and public debate. Reports from Africa of reduced risk of acquiring HIV among circumcised men have brought new attention to adult male circumcision, which is now actively promoted many sub-Saharan African countries.The technological breakthroughs of the Pap smear in the 1950s, HPV testing in the 1990s, and the HPV vaccine in the 2000s should also include prevention by male circumcision. Visual inspection of the cervix and cryotherapy can treat precancerous cervical lesions in areas of developing countries as part of community health worker programs.Colorectal cancer, the 7th leading cause of death in high income countries, is amenable to prevention by early screening using colonoscopy and fecal occult blood (FOB) testing. Screening is recommended for all persons over age 50 at 5 year intervals along with annual FOB testing. Where there is a family history of colorectal cancer or polyps, routine screening should begin earlier. Increasing use of screening and improved medical care are resulting in improving survival and declining mortality rates.Stomach cancer is 10th leading cause of death in upper middle income countries. Prevention relies on early treatment of chronic peptic ulcer disease caused by Helicobacter pylori infection. This is readily diagnosed by a simple breath test and completely cured by low cost antibiotics. Increased awarenss and access to these services would enhance long term trends of reducing mortality from stomach cancer.Liver cancer is 8th leading cause of death in upper middle income countries due to the global prevalence of hepatitis B and helaptitis C. Hepatitis B is now falling due to widespread vaccination in childhood. Hepatitis C is now the major cause of liver cancer affecting hundreds of millions of persons world-wide. There is still no vaccine currently available, but screening and treatment is now used in the industrialized countries and will become more widely used as simpler, less costly treatments with less side effects are becoming available.Early detection of lung cancer with spiral low dose tomodensitometry for smokers is recently being recommended by many professional bodies.More basic cancer preventive measures such as smoking cessation, healthy diets, regular exercise, and moderate alcohol use are discussed in chapter 5.Sources: World Health Organization.

In 2006, CCHSA introduced standards for child welfare, hospice, palliative and end-of-life care facilities, prison facilities, biomedical laboratories, and supplementary criteria for telehealth. In 2008 CCHSA officially became Accreditation Canada, providing services to other countries. The ever-changing health and social environment now accommodates specialized needs in a diversity of service areas as an adjunct to the hospital accreditation process. Examples are shown in Box 15.5\n.BOX 15.5Accreditation Canada International Accreditation ProgramThe Canadian health services accreditation program began in 1917 in conjunction with the American College of Surgeons (ACS) with a hospital standardization program. The first Minimum Standard for Hospitals developed requirements of just one page. In 1918, on-site inspections of hospitals began, with 89 of 692 hospitals surveyed meeting the requirements of the Minimum Standard. In 1926, the first Standards Manual was issued.In 1951, the American College of Physicians, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and the Canadian Medical Association joined with the ACS to create the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals (JCAH). It is an independent, not-for-profit organization whose purpose is to provide voluntary accreditation. In 1953, the Canadian Hospital Association (now the Canadian Healthcare Association), the Canadian Medical Association, the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons, and l\u2019Association des M\u00e9decins de Langue Fran\u00e7aise du Canada established the Canadian Commission on Hospital Accreditation. The Commission\u2019s purpose was to create a Canadian program for hospital accreditation, and in 1958 the Canadian Council on Hospital Accreditation (CCHSA) was incorporated.In 2008 CCHSA became Accreditation Canada International. The accreditation program is used by all types of health facilities, from large and complex hospitals, to health systems, community health organizations, and residences providing long-term care. Its scope includes a wide range of programs, including standards on child welfare, hospice palliative and end-of-life care, biomedical laboratory services, blood banks, and supplementary criteria for Telehealth. The accreditation program covers a diversity of health care and service areas, service programs for brain injury, ambulatory care, assisted reproductive technology \u2013 clinical and laboratory services, Canadian Forces health services, cancer agencies, child welfare organizations, First Nations and Inuit addictions and community health services, the Federal Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs, substance abuse and problem gambling treatment services.The accreditation service is on a contract basis with specialized health programs, other federal government departments, for-profit health facilities, and community organizations across the provinces.Accreditation Canada International works with other countries to develop national accreditation programs for their countries, and launched its first international program for acute care, primary care, ambulatory care, and clinical laboratories in 2010.Source: Accreditation Canada International.

In hospitals, this includes review of deaths, maternal mortality and infant mortality cases, surgical rates, complications following surgery, and infection rates. Medical records and computer information systems permit users to review records by diagnosis. These records can be utilized to assess other events in hospitals, such as time from admission to surgery, lengths of stay by diagnosis, response to abnormal laboratory findings, and many other indicators of the process of care. Obstetric departments can review the frequency of and criteria for caesarean section deliveries. Surgical departments review their appendectomy rates to separate pathological findings from normal appendices.

Critics also suggest that this may promote altering diagnoses to higher cost units of service. Others think that DRGs, by reducing length of stay, have turned hospitals into intensive care units with ultra-sick patients. Despite these issues, the trend towards short hospital stays and newer approaches to active treatment seems to be compatible with better care and improved outcomes, according to some measures. The rapid decline in mortality rates from coronary heart disease is thought to be due in large part to the activist treatment approach, with lengths of stay of 1 week or less for acute myocardial infarction compared to 6 weeks on average up to the 1970s.",

TQM involves everyone in the system, from all levels of management to production or service personnel and support staff, and thus helps to raise staff morale because of the shared involvement. Health is provided through multidisciplinary groups which need to approach problems with open and shared scientific inquiry and hypothesis formation, testing, and revision to find operational solutions to problems. Electronic health records and information technology provide many new opportunities to improve patient care and data systems for monitoring the health status of population groups for process and outcome measures, or health targets, such as immunization coverage, or screening compliance for colon, cervical, or breast cancer, as measures of performance in primary care. Information technology adds a great deal of capacity for quality monitoring and improvement measures.",

Cost and quality are interrelated, as poor quality leads to waste, inefficiency, and dissatisfaction of both clients and staff.

During 2007, guidelines were issued on topics including asthma, dermatitis, caesarean section, chronic obstructive lung disease, depression (in children and adults), eating disorders, fertility, contraception, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder, and diabetic foot care (Box 15.8\n).\nBOX 15.8The UK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), established in 1999, has a mandate to review health service treatments and effective therapies that should be commissioned and made available within the National Health Service (NHS) throughout England and Wales. The mission statement for NICE is that it \u201ccontributes to better health around the world through the more effective and equitable use of resources\u201d. In 2005 NICE was revised to include reviews of public health interventions, and its mandate was expanded to include quality standards for the English social care sector (English Health and Social Care Act of 2011). Now renamed the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE operates as a statutory independent special health authority in England and Wales. Commissioning bodies of the NHS are required to observe its recommendations. Guidance can be used by the NHS, local authorities, employers, voluntary groups, and anyone else involved in delivering care or promoting well-being.NICE recommendations are respected elsewhere in the UK, but are not mandatory; in Scotland NICE recommendations are published after further review by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (for health services issues) and by NHS Health Scotland (for public health recommendations). NICE recommendations are respected worldwide, including by the European Commission and by national governments; NICE International is a section of NICE established to meet non-UK needs (e.g., evaluating rural health programs in China).An independent committee including lay representation advises on priorities for NICE consideration but final decisions on topics referred to NICE are made by the Department of Health. When making recommendations to the NHS on which services (e.g., treatments) should be provided routinely, it calculates the cost-effectiveness of treatment for each quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of health gain purchased.NICE publications include guidance on 374 interventional procedures, 270 technology appraisals, 162 clinical guidelines, and 43 public health topics. From this latter group, some examples include:\u2022\nPrevention of cardiovascular diseases (2010) \u2013 provides evidence of effectiveness of population-based prevention programs as more effective than programs aimed at high-risk groups.\u2022\nAlcohol dependence and harmful alcohol use (2011) \u2013 summarizes all NICE guidance; designed to inform members of the public as well as health professionals.\u2022\nPreventing type 2 diabetes through population and community interventions (2011) \u2013 provides guidance to government departments, the commercial sector, health service organizations, and non-governmental organizations on integration of public policy to prevent obesity, and reduce diabetes prevalence and complications.\u2022\nPreventing uptake of smoking by children and young people (2008) \u2013 document to advise local health service commissioners; identifies target populations, reviews campaign messages, and provides recommendations for the mass media and retailers.\u2022\nPromoting mental well-being at work (2009) \u2013 guidance aimed at employers; reviews evidence in the field and recommends strategic approaches by firms, opportunities to promote well-being and assess risk, and systems of flexible working.\u2022\nPreventing unintentional injuries among under-15s in the home (2010) \u2013 reviews evidence and makes recommendations to local authorities and related agencies on training an appropriate workforce, advises government to fund curricula development, and indicates to the NHS appropriate surveillance and treatment services.\nNICE is often criticized (especially by the pharmaceutical industry) for the time taken to carry out investigations of new treatments. It is also criticized by relatives of patients with \u201cglamorous\u201d conditions (e.g., cancer) for not approving drugs that might extend life by only 4\u20136 weeks, and perhaps approving instead new psychiatric therapies. The current government has recently sought to overrule some of these NICE recommendations in England. However, NICE methods and recommendations are held in high repute, within the UK and beyond.Sources: Christopher Birt FRCP FFPH, University of Liverpool, UK.

AIDS was initially addressed as a civil liberties issue and not as a public health problem. Screening, reporting, and case contact follow-up were seen as an invasion of privacy and proved counterproductive by increasing resistance to and avoidance of testing. Protection of privacy and an educational approach were adopted as most feasible and acceptable.

A society may see universal access to health care as a positive value, and at the same time utilize incentives to promote the use of services of benefit to the individual, such as hospital care, immunization, and screening programs. Some services may be arbitrarily excluded from health insurance, such as dental care, although this is to the detriment of children and a financial hardship for many. Strategies for program inclusion are often based on historical precedent rather than cost-effectiveness or evidence. While efforts are being made to include more children in the program, the Medicaid system in the USA defines eligibility at income levels of 185 percent of the poverty line, thus excluding a high percentage of the working poor.

At the opposite extreme, many western medical centers use extreme and costly measures to prolong life in terminally ill patients, preserving life temporarily but often with much suffering for the person and at great expense to the public system of financing health care.",

Such ethical failures occur frequently and widely. For example, is it \u201cunethical\u201d not to fortify grain products with folic acid, and salt with iodine? Should there be a recommended European immunization program; should milk be fortified with vitamin D; should vitamin and mineral supplements be given to women and children; should all newborns be given intramuscular vitamin K routinely? Other examples include the issues of fluoridation of water supplies and opposition to genetically modified crops or generic drugs in African countries. These issues are continuously debated and the responsibility of the trained public health professional is to review the international literature on a topic and formulate a position based on the cumulative weight of evidence. It is not possible to wait for indisputable evidence because in epidemiology and public health this rarely occurs.

            "text": "The human and national cost of genocide lasts for generations. The hatred and fear may wane but the trauma goes deep. It lasts with the victims and their descendants, but also with the perpetrating country and its culture. The Nazi Holocaust has had downstream effects in public health in the German-speaking countries which last to the present time, seven decades since the events took place. The long-term damage done to public health in Germany and Austria is described in Box 15.16\n.BOX 15.16The Rise, Fall, and Slow Recovery of German Public HealthIn the German context the social\u2013ecological health paradigm can be traced back to the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries when the country was a loose alliance of kingdoms or princedoms lagging behind the economic, cultural, and political developments in England and France. Ensuring population health was seen as the obligation of the state, while the family was responsible for caring for the health and well-being of its members. Organized health care and health maintenance was seen in the framework of Medizinische Polizey, as a model of the health systems. Leading scholars in law and medicine shared a normative perspective of promoting a healthy lifestyle (known as dietetics), and provision of shelter, food, and spiritual aid in asylums for the sick and disabled, or in private homes the for wealthy.In the second half of the nineteenth century evidence from medical statistics and overwhelming practical experience indicated that widespread poverty was the critical factor explaining high rates of typhus or cholera epidemics in lower social classes among children and industrial workers. A social health movement fought for healthier living and working conditions, education, and democracy. The movement\u2019s prominent leaders were Salomon Neumann, a physician pioneer in medical statistics, and Rudolf Virchow, the renowned pathologist and outspoken political activist.Between 1890 and 1930 the conceptual framework of public health was defined as \u201csocial hygiene\u201d or \u201chealth science\u201d, an interdisciplinary field to conduct scientific research, academic teaching, and community-based activities aiming at the promotion of individual and collective health and the prevention of disease. In the 1920s the field was highly developed and pioneering the modern academic public health.Social hygiene was a general framework open to different definitions. A group of academic teachers and publishing scientists sharing the social\u2013ecological paradigm, among them a high proportion of German Jews, wanted to continue the social reform strategy and to strengthen local communities to take an active role in the formulation and implementation of health policies.Public health activists sharing the biotechnological disease paradigm favored a more focused approach aiming at the control of disease through medical care. Although there was no supportive evidence, in the late nineteenth century a racial eugenic movement emerged widely in Europe and the USA. A conceptual model derived from the disease paradigm postulated racial factors to explain disease. A healthy population was assumed to be \u201cfree\u201d of \u201cracially contaminated\u201d individuals and inferior groups. Health-related public policy was supposed to eliminate racially \u201cunclean\u201d members, e.g., by forced sterilization or murder. This was a central theme in Hitler\u2019s Mein Kampf and was enacted as basic policy by the Nazi Party in Germany as a fundamental ideological basis of racial theory and public health.When the Nazis were legally elected in Germany in 1933, and later seized power in Austria, this policy provided fertile ground to open the door to euthanasia, leading to mass murder. This was implemented in the well-organized, medically directed execution of mentally and physically handicapped Germans and others in psychiatric facilities. This provided a working model for the industrialized murder of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust and millions of gypsies, homosexuals, communists, and others.It took only 10 years to eradicate a 200-year tradition of German socially oriented public health grounded largely in the political philosophy of human rights and social justice. Most of those advocates were exiled or murdered. Many of the academic medical leaders after World War II remained in key positions in the German public sector for decades.In contrast to many other countries, the two wealthy German-speaking countries, with over 90 million people, have few academic public health resources. In there is only one German School of Public Health, and a small number of institutes, far fewer in Austria than in Germany. More than half a century has passed since the Nazi period and the populations of these two countries are slow to build a new socially oriented public health system.Sources: Horst Noack MD, PhD, Professor Emeritus, Medical University of Graz, Austria.

It was meant to follow the natural course of syphilis in 399 already infected African American men in Alabama and 201 uninfected men. The men were not told that they were being used as research subjects. The experiment had been intended to show the need for additional services for those infected with syphilis. However, when penicillin became available, the researchers did not inform or offer the men treatment, even those who were eligible when drafted into the army in 1942. The experiment was stopped in 1972 as \u201cethically unjustified\u201d when the media exposed it to public scrutiny.The case is considered unethical research practice because, even at the time it was conducted, it did not provide the patients with available care and their well-being was put aside in the interest of the descriptive study. A similar experiment was conducted by the US Public Health Service in cooperation with the Guatamala Ministry of Health during the 1960s, in which syphilis was actually given to soldiers, prisoners, and others by sexual contact with prostitutes known to have the disease, but the study was terminated when it was discovered by a public health historian and reached public attention in the USA.In 1997, President Bill Clinton apologized to the survivors and families of the men involved in the experiment on behalf of the US government. The Tuskegee experiment is the source of lingering widespread suspicion in the African American community to the present time.Sources: Lombardo PA, Dorr GM.

Clinical research uses experimental methods to establish the efficacy and safety of new interventions or unproved interventions; many drugs and procedures in common use have never been subjected to randomized controlled trials. In practice, many methods are devised that are held to be effective and safe by expert opinion and documented as such. Researchers comparing HIV or hepatitis B transmission rates among intravenous drug users not using needle-exchange programs would be conducting unethical research, according to accepted current standards, by giving needles to the experimental group and withholding them from the control group. The scientific justification of an experiment must be made explicit and justifiable. Clinical equivalence is a necessary condition of all clinical and public health research and provision of standard of care treatment to control groups is a minimal requirement for most research ethics boards. Determination of the standard, and whether it should be place, time, and community specific, is an area of ongoing controversy.",

The article reported on 12 cases of autistic children and alleged to show a connection to immunization with the MMR (measles\u2013mumps\u2013rubella) vaccine.The immediate effect of this \u201crevelation\u201d was widespread alarm over the MMR vaccine and a fall off in immunization coverage by measles-containing vaccines in the UK and elsewhere with many mothers refusing to have their child vaccinated due to a \u201crisk of autism\u201d. As a result, measles epidemics occurred in the UK and in many other countries, with measles again becoming endemic in many parts of Europe, especially England and France.After a long series of investigative journalism in the British press, the article came under scientific scrutiny and withdrawal of many of the coauthors but a consistent insistence by the lead author of its authenticity.Investigation by British medical authorities later found Dr Wakefield guilty of medical negligence and the UK General Medical Council withdrew his license to practice medicine. The coauthors were found to have been credulous and insufficiently vigilant in agreeing to coauthorship of the paper. In 2000, 12 years after the original publication, The Lancet formally withdrew the article.The effect of this fraudulent scientific publication was a serious loss of credibility of immunization in general and especially regarding the MMR vaccine, one of the greatest life savers in public health technology.The return of measles in Europe to large scale epidemics with frequent international transmission furthered the loss of confidence of mothers in immunizations and public health. Measles-containing vaccines were particularly strongly affected owing to the publicity given to the Wakefield case. The journal editors could be seen as irresponsible for failing to ensure the scientific integrity of lead authors and coauthors, and the journal for failing to retract a fraudulent article sooner than 12 years after the first publication.In other public health issues, single publications of findings of small sample and poorly assessed studies published in haste without adequate inquisitive review occur with great frequency. The electronic media often include unscientific opinion blogs which appear larger than life which provoke great anxiety over accepted and successful public health interventions such as fluoridation or folic acid fortification of flour, with unsubstantiated claims that they cause cancer, asthma, and other ill-effects.The interface between ethics, law, and science in public health requires continuous sensitivity to the downstream effects of \u201cshouting fire in the theater\u201d.Sources: Wakefield AJ, Murch SH, Anthony A, Linnell, Casson DM, Malik M, et al.

Inertia of the public health system in the face of evidence of a demonstrably effective modality such as adoption of state-of-the-art vaccines or fortification of flour with folic acid to prevent birth defects would come under this categorization and may even constitute neglect and unethical practice. This is not an easy categorization, because there is often disagreement and even opposition to public health interventions, as was the case with opposition to vaccination long after Jenner\u2019s crucial discovery of this procedure in the late eighteenth century.

            "text": "The use of ethical and high standards of practice in public health (Box 15.20\n) requires an ideological commitment to the advancement of health standards and use of best practices of international standards to the maximum extent possible under the local conditions in which the professional is working. This is not an easy commitment as there is often dispute and outright hostility to public health activities, in part because of ethical distortions of great magnitude in the past. But this is an optimistic field of activity because of the great achievements it has brought to humankind. Preparation for disasters and unanticipated health emergencies in addition to addressing current issues is a vital part of the New Public Health and our ethical and professional commitments.BOX 15.20The Ethics of Publication in Public HealthPublication in peer-reviewed journals is a key part of the advancement in science and a vital part of the development of the scientific basis for public health practice. The process of publication should promote rigorous standards of high quality ethical research and the wide dissemination of their findings. Codes of practice for editors and publishers of peer-reviewed journals have been developed by both the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) (Rees, 2011) and the World Association of World Editors (WAME).Editors are subject to competitive pressures, and the overarching metric of success is seen to be the impact factor, a measure of the frequency with which the \u201caverage article\u201d in a journal has been cited in a particular year or period. Relevant, rigorous research of better quality will tend to be cited more frequently, and thus editorial strategies that look for quality and relevance in the given field will increase the impact factor. However, there can also be potential distorting factors. Publishing a highly controversial paper can result in high citation levels. Publishing studies which demonstrate negative findings may be less likely to attract large numbers of citations.Key issues relate to conflicts of interest, and the potential for advertising and sponsorship to distort editorial decision making (Gray, 2012). A particular concern has been the pernicious influence of the tobacco industry in sponsoring, frequently covertly, research which has aimed to confuse or obfuscate key findings linking second hand exposure to tobacco to adverse impacts on health. Similar tactics are used in other areas where health and commercial interests collide. Clear statements of potential conflicts of interest are essential. Journal owners must not interfere in the evaluation, selection, or editing of individual articles, either directly or by creating an environment in which editorial decisions are strongly influenced.Other challenging areas are plagiarism and research misconduct. The latter is extremely difficult both to detect and to deal with, and requires close working between institutions and editors who may suspect professional misconduct. In cases of fraud, the publishing journal should withdraw the article in a timely fashion (see Box 15.18: The Wakefield Effect).There has been a rapid rise in open access publishing, in part underpinned by an ethical belief that research is a public good, and an increasing number of influential research funders now require that there should be unrestricted access to the published output of research. In addition, several publishers make their journals free to those in selected low-income countries, promoting dissemination to those who might not otherwise afford them.In summary, publication in peer-reviewed journals remains a key method for establishing and progressing the evidence base for public health practice. The consequences of poor or frankly fraudulent science can have a substantial adverse impact both on health and on the use of resources. Editors must adhere to high ethical and professional standards and remain vigilant to avoid allowing external drivers to distort their decision-making processes. They must strive to maintain integrity and high scientific standards to advance the field of public health practice (Smith, 2007).Sources: Selena Gray, BSc, MBCHB, MD, FFPH, FRCP, Professor, University of West of England, Bristol, and Deputy Postgraduate Dean, Severn Deanery, Bristol, UK.
