Thus, there is the possibility that the two cats with false\u2010positive staining in the present study suffered from two diseases, their tumors and early\u2010stage FIP, but still without histopathological lesions.

Possibly, they were infected with a \u2018harmless\u2019 FECV that was able to cross the blood\u2013aqueous barrier and enter the aqueous humor in the presence of their systemic disease.

Previous studies on ICC or immunofluorescence using effusion or CSF have reported higher sensitivities of 85\u2013100%.6, 7, 8 One explanation that not all cats with FIP were positive in ICC is a low number of macrophages in the examined specimens. Especially in cats without uveitis the number of macrophages in the aqueous humor can be low, but could be much higher if inflammation is present. Given the fact that only one of the cats with positive ICC results on aqueous humor samples showed clinical signs or histopathological changes indicative of uveitis, the sensitivity appears rather high when compared to sensitivity of immunostaining in other material, such as effusion. Nevertheless, aqueous humor cytology was abnormal in all of the cats with FIP for which cytological data was available and in 11/12 of the control cats, regardless of whether they showed signs of uveitis. All of the control cats suffered from severe diseases, such as neoplasia, commonly associated with inflammation, which can explain their abnormal aqueous humor. Apparently, inflammatory and neoplastic cells originating from other parts of the body are able to cross the blood\u2013aqueous barrier, even without the presence of uveitis. A sufficient number of macrophages was detected cytologically in 8/9 cats with FIP with false negative ICC results. Thus, lack of cellularity is unlikely responsible for the false\u2010negative results.",

It is possible that antemortem paracentesis would lead to a better diagnostic utility of the ICC. Some degradation of macrophages might have occurred at the time of sampling. Antemortem paracentesis therefore might lead to a higher sensitivity of the ICC. Further explanations for a low sensitivity are a competitive binding of FCoV in immune complexes by circulating antibodies. Also the use of a monoclonal antibody in the staining protocol could be a reason, and a polyclonal antibody conjugate might have increased sensitivity (but concurrently decreased specificity).",

If performed antemortem, 27\u2010 to 29\u2010G needles are usually used to reduce the risk of ocular damage.20 The use of the larger needle could have resulted in improved cell retrieval and reduced cell disruption which might be a problem in antemortem samples. This is a limitation of the present study. Another limitation is the fact that no control cats with uveitis were included, and future studies are required to compare this new method in cats with and without uveitis by taking antemortem samples. Additionally, ophthalmological examination was not routinely performed in all of the cats, and only a relatively small number of cats was included in each group. Another limitation of this study is the fact that only four cats with FIP did not have effusions. Therefore, the usefulness of ICC in the diagnosis of FIP in cats without effusion cannot be determined and further studies should be performed in cats without effusion. Finally, the present study would have been enhanced by the inclusion of a RT\u2010PCR assay using aqueous humor samples. Possibly, RT\u2010PCR would have been useful in the clarification of the origin of the positive immunostaining in the two cats without histopathologically confirmed FIP and in the equivocal samples.
