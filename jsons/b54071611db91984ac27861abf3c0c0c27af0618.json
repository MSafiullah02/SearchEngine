We examined serum samples obtained from 46 patients with SARS, 40 patients with non-SARS pneumonia, and 38 healthy individuals, by use of Western blotting (WB), enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA), and immunofluorescence assay, using both native and bacterially produced antigens of the virus. We found a highly restricted, immunoglobulin Gdominated antibody response in patients with SARS, directed most frequently (89% by ELISA) and predominantly at the nucleocapsid. Almost all of the subjects without SARS had no antinucleocapsid antibodies. The spike protein was the next most frequently targeted, but only 63% of the patients (by ELISA) responded. Other targets of the response identified by use of WB included antigens of 80 and 60 kDa. Several nonstructural proteins cloned were not antigenic, and the culture-derived nucleocapsid appeared to be specifically degraded.",

All 4 patients with SARS who were negative for antibodies had low IFA titers (!1:80). All serum samples were not reactive with the control antigen, GST (data not shown). The results are based on the IgG response. The IgM response, in contrast, was less robust and less frequent (43%) among the patients with SARS (figure 2) and less discriminatory between the SARS and non-SARS cohorts. Second, we made a recombinant antigen of the N-terminal half of the N protein (rNa), and, when it was used in an IgG ELISA, we found results almost identical to those found with the crude viral extract (89% sensitivity and 94%-95% specificity), including 4 negative cases in common ( figure 2) .

This result was not due to the fact that we used a singledilution measurement in the ELISA, rather than titrating the serum ( figure 4C ). It is possible that some antigens cannot be extracted from the cell or become degraded during the extraction, but this was not the case with NSP12 or NSP9. It is noteworthy that the serum samples from the 3 patients with non-SARS pneumonia, which reacted with the (presumably) N1 component by WB, were negative by the rNa ELISA.

This result implies that there was strong T helper cell involvement. An exaggerated T cell response probably also accounts for the pneumonia-associated immunopathology seen in patients with SARS [10] . The N antigen may be important here. It may indeed be both a potent B cell and a potent T cell immunogen; that is, an important candidate for a vaccine. Although antibodies to the nucleocapsid are nonneutralizing, whether such antibodies can be protective in other ways, as observed for mouse hepatitis virus [20] and rotavirus [21] , needs to be addressed formally. The latter phenomenon may be due to the ability of the IgA antibodies to enter the infected cell by the IgA-transcytosis pathway, thereby interfering with viral transcription [14] .",

N1 is presumably the full-length protein, and the others are fragments of N1 that lack varying lengths of the C-terminal end. Because of the high specificity seen, we do not consider the degradation to be an artifact of the antigen-extraction procedure.
