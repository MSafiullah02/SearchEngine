Such scaling laws provide a description of the data and the complex system by fractal scaling exponents. Nevertheless, many records do not present a simple monofractal scaling behavior and different parts of the series require different scaling exponents. In even more complicated cases, such different scaling behavior can be observed for many interwoven fractal subsets of the time series, where a multitude of scaling exponents is required for a full characterization of the scaling behavior in the same range of time scales and a multifractal analysis must be applied. In order to observe the fractals and multifractals in time series, algorithms have been developed one by another [1], [2].",

            "text": "Since detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has been proposed by Peng et al. [3] to detect the long-range power-law correlations in DNA sequences, it has been successfully applied to diverse fields [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Then Podobnik and Stanley [12] generalized DFA and introduced the detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) for two non-stationary time series, which has aroused increasing interest in analysis of long-range cross-correlation and multifractality [1], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Specifically, the analysis is based on the bivariate Hurst exponent hxy estimation, which is related to an asymptotic power-law decay of the cross-correlation function. A power-law cross-correlated process has the cross-correlation function Cxy(k)\u221dk2hxy\u22122 for k\u2192+\u221e and the cross-power spectrum |fxy(s)|\u221ds1\u22122hxy for s\u21920+. hxy=0.5 is characteristic for the absence of power-law cross-correlation, while processes with hxy > 0.5 are cross-persistent and hxy < 0.5 indicates the anti-persistent cross-correlation of the data [2], [12], [25]. Basis of these, the cross-correlation coefficient (\u03c3DCCA) was introduced with the objective of quantifying the level of cross-correlation between non-stationary time series [26], [27], [28]. In the DFA\u2013DCCA-\u03c3DCCA line, Kristoufek [29] has recently introduced the DFA framework to estimate regression parameters at different scales and under potential non-stationarity and power-law correlations. Alternatively, the detrending moving-average (DMA) method can also be used for fractal or multifractal analysis, found that the backward multifractal detrending moving average (MFDMA) algorithm outperforms the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) [30], [31], [32], [33]. As an alternative to \u03c3DCCA, based on the detrending moving-average cross-correlation analysis (DMCA), the DMCA coefficient \u03c1DMCA was proposed as well [17], [34]. To investigate the multifractal features of two cross-correlated non-stationary series, several methods have been proposed for this purpose. Zhou [14] further proposed multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MFDCCA) as a generation of DCCA. Jiang and Zhou [35] developed a class of MFDCCA algorithms based on DMA, called MFXDMA whose performances are comparative to MFDCCA\u2019s. Moreover, a new method for the detection of long-range cross-correlations and multifractality based on scaling of qth order covariances, multifractal height cross-correlation analysis (MF-HXA), was proposed by Kristoufek [18]. Meanwhile, statistical moments function or partition function has been widely applied to analyze the multifractal features of financial time series [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]. Based on this approach, Jiang and Zhou [38] investigated the multifractal characteristics in intraday minutely data for four stock market indexes within individual trading days and found the so-called multifractality is merely an illusion. Dissimilarly, when they performed the partition function approach on the 1-min volatility of two indexes and 1139 stocks in the Chinese stock markets, multifractal nature is significant [39]. Extending that from one dimension to two dimensions, Wang et al. [40] introduced the multifractal cross-correlation analysis based on statistical moments (MFSMXA) as an application of the joint multifractal measures [41], finding that MFSMXA has comparative performance with MFXDMA and sometimes perform slightly better than MFDCCA. By far, multifractal analysis has been employed successfully in various provinces, such as human nature [42], [43], [44], financial time series [45], [46], [47], river flow [48] and traffic signals [49], etc.",

Consider two time series {X(i)} and {Y(i)} of the same length N, where i=1,2,\u2026,N.\nStep 1:Divide each series into Ns = int(N/s) non-overlapping segments of equal length s. For a given segment size s, the elements in the vth segment can be described as:\n(1)x(i,s)=x((v\u22121)s+i)andy(i,s)=y((v\u22121)s+i),where v=1,2,\u2026,Ns and i=1,2,\u2026,s.Step 2:For each segment, we define a quantity u as follows,\n(2)uX=uX[(v\u22121)s+1,vs]=\u2211ix[(v\u22121)s+i]uY=uY[(v\u22121)s+1,vs]=\u2211iy[(v\u22121)s+i],where [(v\u22121)s+1,vs] is the vth segment. The measure \u03bc in each segment is constructed as follows,\n(3)\u03bcX(v,s)=uX(v,s)/(\u2211v=1NsuX(v,s)),\u03bcY(v,s)=uY(v,s)/(\u2211v=1NsuY(v,s)).\nStep 3:Calculate the statistical moments function FXY(q, s)\n(4)FXY(q,s)=\u2211v=1Ns|\u03bcX(v,s)\u00b7\u03bcY(v,s)|q/2\u2261Ns\u00b7\u3008|\u03bcX(v,s)\u00b7\u03bcY(v,s)|q/2\u3009.\nStep 4:Determine scaling behavior of cross statistical moment functions by analyzing log-log plots of FXY(q, s) versus s for each value of q. We expect it to scale as\n(5)FXY(q,s)\u223cs\u03c4XY(q),where the exponent \u03c4XY(q) is a scaling exponent function, regarded as a characteristic function of the fractal behavior. Note that \u03c4XY(0)=\u22121. For q=2, the method is used to detect the long-range cross-correlations between series, which we call it cross-correlation analysis based on statistical moments (SMXA). When {X(i)}={Y(i)}, the above method reduces to the multifractal analysis for separate series (MFSMA) [36], [37], [38], [39].\n",

Thus, the importance of long-range cross-correlations and multifractality resides in the scaling of covariances between |\u03bcX(v, s)|q/2 and |\u03bcY(v, s)|q/2 regarding varying s and q. As a consequence, there are two types of cross-multifractality: (i) cross-multifractality caused by multifractality of the separate series, and (ii) cross-multifractality by scaling of covariances between |\u03bcX(v, s)|q/2 and |\u03bcY(v, s)|q/2.",

And to a certain extent, the measure \u03bc is kind of frequency or probability. To improve that, we propose a modification of current MFSMXA, called weighted MFSMXA method based on Shannon entropy (W-MFSMXA), to take into account that not all measurements contribute equally when constructing the statistical moments function and to save as much information as possible carried by the series. Specifically, the motivation behind this is to weight proportionally segments with distinct measurements \u03bc but the same final FXY(q, s). For example, consider a simple case and let Ns=5 and q=2, where \u03bcx1=(0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2),\n\u03bcy1=(0.1,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.3) and \u03bcx2=(0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2),\n\u03bcy2=(0.1,0.1,0.2,0.3,0.3). Generally we will get Fxy1=Fxy2=0.2, but if we consider the effect of weight on the contrary, Fxy1=0.0408 and Fxy2=0.0417 are not equal. Weights here are \u03c91=(0.1744,0.2033,0.2033,0.2033,0.2157) and \u03c92=(0.1773,0.1773,0.2067,0.2193,0.2193) according to the procedure described detailedly in the following. The selection of Shannon entropy [57] to be the weight factor makes sure that \u03bc with higher value is assigned more weights. Furthermore, Shannon entropy as a complexity (or regularity or orderliness) measure quantifies the information richness of \u03bc in series and this novel information-based approach has been successfully employed in literary authorship disputes [50], SARS coronavirus [51], biologic signals [52] and financial time series analysis [53].",

Obviously, \u03c4xy(\u03c9)(q) are nonlinear and upwards convex, which indicates the multifractal nature between two time series. What\u2019s more, \u03c4xy(\u03c9)(q) and \u03c4xy(q) are almost parallel to each other. When shifting the figure of \u03c4xy(\u03c9)(q) to right with unit 1, \u03c4xy(\u03c9)(q) and \u03c4xy(q) coincide pretty well (not shown here), which is identical with Fxy(\u03c9)(q,s) closer to Fxy(q+1,s). Similar results can be obtained for series {x(i)} and {z(i)} and for series {y(i)} and {z(i)}, which are obvious in Figs. 2 and 3a. Table 1 shows the corresponding singularity widths \u0394\u03bb captured before and after the weighting procedure. For two algorithms, \u0394\u03bb are much larger than zero and differences of \u0394\u03bb deviate insignificantly from zero. Thus, we assume that except for the phase, the multifractal structure of the series will not be changed after being weighted, and it\u2019s reasonable to believe there is a delay in MFSMXA compared to W-MFSMXA.",

            "text": "It is worthwhile to note that short length N of the investigated series or small scale s often results in a spurious detection of multifractal behavior from a monofractal model [19]. To evaluate the finite-size effect [25] of the BMF model, performances of the scaling exponent \u03c4(q) estimators in MFSM(X)A and the proposed W-MFSM(X)A are studied. In all cases, time series with length N=2nmax are analyzed, where nmax={10,11,12,13,14,15,16}. The scales s are given by s=round[logspace(log10(Tmin),log10(Tmax),30)], where Tmin=100,\nTmax=N/4 and round(X) means rounding the elements of X to the nearest integers. For series with different parameters px={0.1,0.2,0.25,0.3,0.4} in Eq. (21), results of the evaluation of (cross-) multifractality are presented in appendix. Significantly, for analyses of separate series in MFSMA and W-MFSMA (see Figs. 9 and 10), two \u03c4(q) estimators, namely \u03c4xx(q) and \u03c4xx(\u03c9)(q), have the same performances: (1) For sequences with different length sizes, numerical results of \u03c4xx(q) and \u03c4xx(\u03c9)(q) coincide well with the corresponding theoretical values respectively except for nmax=10; (2) For px=0.4 in Figs. 9e and 10 e, all series perform well especially in W-MFSMA; (3) Generally, nmax=11\u221213 are acceptable while nmax=14\u221216 are more reliable, which is accordant with the results of MFSMXA procedure between two time series in Fig. 11. Results of \u03c4xy(\u03c9)(q) between two time series in W-MFSMXA are plotted in Fig. 12. Yet again, nine pairs of data used here for cross-multifractal analysis are significantly correlated (see Table 2). It is clear to see that \u03c4xy(\u03c9)(q) deviate significantly from the theoretical values when nmax=10, same as in MFSM(X)A and W-MFSMA. In most of cases, performances of \u03c4xy(\u03c9)(q) when nmax=11\u221216 are comparative. While when px=0.1,py=0.25 and px=0.1,py=0.3 (see Figs. 12b and c), nmax=11\u221213 are the best. In general, on the basis of investigations in this section, performances of W-MFSMA are as good as MFSMA\u2019s and nmax=11\u221216 are suggested for use in MFSM(X)A or W-MFSM(X)A. Nevertheless, W-MFSMXA outperforms MFSMXA for series with relatively shorter length, i.e., nmax=11\u221213. At this point, W-MFSM(X)A is comparable to MFSM(X)A. In order not to seem rigmarole, we only illustrate the results of one pair of experimental data in following experiments.",

[59]. To our knowledge, no analytic expression has been generated for this model. Series analyzed here are with a given preparation as in Section 3.1, then we apply MFSMXA and W-MFSMXA algorithms to the NBVP series to examine the validity of the assumption about delay in Section 3.2. Results are shown in Fig. 5. Singularity widths in this case are \u0394\u03bb=0.5242 and \u0394\u03bb(\u03c9)=0.5294, which are insignificantly deviated. Same as the previous part, except for the position and several discrepant points, the multifractal structure of the series remains unchanged. \u03c4xy(\u03c9)(q) and \u03c4xy(q) after multiplying correspond a(q) are nearly coincident and the hyperbolic characteristics of a(q) with respect to q is more obvious. In other words, the \u03c4xy(q) measurements in both method are apparently different for relatively smaller q but more accordant for higher q while never equal. Proposition about the delay is further verified. It can be seen in Fig. 5d, the scaling of covariances \u03b7(q)\u22121 is higher than the average of scaling of separate processes for negative moment orders q, the deviations are nevertheless not significant for higher positive q. In contrast, \u03b7(q)\u22121 basically coincides with \u03c4xy(q), implying that the cross-multifractality of series is mainly caused by the scaling of covariances between |\u03bcX(v, s)|q/2 and |\u03bcY(v, s)|q/2 as the construction of the NBVP mixes the long memory of the separate processes.",

The scaling exponents obtained by two methods are almost parallel to each other. What\u2019s more, differences of the corresponding singularity widths captured by two algorithms do not deviate significantly from zero. Thus, it is rational to believe that the multifractal structure of series has not been changed by the weighting procedure without considering their positions. Basis of these, we generated analytic formulas of the BMF model for W-MFSMXA. Theoretical analysis and finite-size effect test verified the good performances of W-MFSMXA. Specifically, numerical results are well in line with the theoretical values and W-MFSMXA outperforms MFSMXA for analysis of series with relatively shorter length. Meanwhile, we generated the scaling exponent ratio a(q), whose profile is approximately a centrosymmetric hyperbola, to describe the relation between W-MFSMXA and MFSMXA. Scaling exponent estimators in both methods are more consistent for relatively higher orders q while never equal, indicating the delay in MFSMXA compared to W-MFSMXA.",
