            "text": "Detection of residual HCV in individuals with SVR after treatment of CHC can be significantly heightened by analyzing ex vivo mitogen-activated T and B lymphocytes and applying sensitive nucleic acid amplification assays. However, it remained unknown if synergistic activation of lymphocytes and monocytes would further augment HCV detection, if viral replication becomes universally upregulated in treated cells, and if examining sequential sera and lymphoid cells would improve detection of occult infection. Using paired sera and lymphoid cells collected 1 year apart from 17 individuals with normal liver enzymes for up to 72 months after SVR, it was found that simultaneous activation of lymphocytes and monocytes enhanced identification of silent HCV infection and revealed that in some cases monocytes were the principal immune cell type where HCV persisted. Testing of serial samples further increased detection of occult infection. Ultimately, by combining the above two approaches, all individuals with SVR were found to be silent carriers of HCV. Clonal sequencing revealed HCV variations in sera and lymphoid cells and evolution of viral genomes confirming ongoing virus replication. Surprisingly, similar to those with CHC, naive lymphoid cells from some individuals carried 10 3 HCV copies/lg total RNA. HCV loads in naive lymphoid cells predetermined the outcome of ex vivo stimulation with respect to upregulation or inhibition of HCV replication. HCV RNA levels in occult infection were inversely proportional to the expression of IFNa and IFNinducible MxA, but not to IFNc or tumour necrosis factor a in naive and mitogen-treated lymphoid cells.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus is an important human pathogen, which causes chronic infection in at least 170 million people worldwide. Up to 85% of acutely infected patients become carriers of the virus and develop CHC, which can advance to cir-rhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma in up to 20% of patients [1] . HCV is a positive single-stranded RNA virus that replicates by making the so-called \u00d4negative strand\u00d5. Although HCV is highly hepatotropic, evidences indicate that it also propagates in the lymphatic [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] and nervous [9, 10] systems. In regard to the lymphatic system, circulating PBMC from patients with CHC [2] [3] [4] [5] and from individuals with apparent complete resolution of hepatitis C, who were serum HCV RNA nonreactive by standard laboratory assays and had normal liver enzymes, have been shown to carry replicating HCV genomes [5] [6] [7] [8] . Low levels of HCV RNA have also been detected in lymphoid cells in a significant proportion of patients with persistently elevated liver enzymes of unknown aetiology [11, 12] . Furthermore, susceptibility of T-and B-cell lines, as well as primary human T cells and monocyte/macrophages to HCV infection has also been shown [13] [14] [15] [16] . It is thought that by invading the immune system, HCV can conceal its presence and enhance the likelihood of persistence, as it has been observed in many other long-term viral infections [17, 18] .",

This therapy results in the so-called SVR in no more than 50% of patients [19] . The SVR is defined as serum HCV RNA negativity for at least 6 months after completion of treatment, as determined by clinical laboratory RT-PCR assays with the current sensitivities between 50 and 3200 virus genome (copies) equivalents [vge]/mL or 50-615 IU/mL [20] . Clinically, individuals with SVR and normal liver function tests have been considered to be free of HCV. However, it has recently been documented that by employing more sensitive RT-PCR detection methods, identifying <10 HCV copies or <5 IU/ mL, the virus can be consistently found in sera, lymphoid cells and hepatic tissue for years after the apparent complete recovery from hepatitis C [5, 6, 8, [21] [22] [23] . In addition, liver biopsies from these individuals occasionally reveal histological evidence of protracted minor inflammation, frequently mild-to-moderate fibrosis or in rare cases, even active chronic hepatitis [21, 22, 24] .",

It became evident that such an approach facilitates a more accurate detection of HCV than by testing sera or naive PBMC. This finding also reaffirmed the notion that lymphotropism is an intrinsic property of HCV. Nevertheless, it remained unknown whether HCV replication is universally upregulated following stimulation of lymphoid cells or is augmented only in specific situations dictated by not as yet determined viral or cellular factors. Investigation of this issue is important to not only better understand HCV-lymphoid cell interactions, but also to assess whether testing of ex vivo stimulated lymphoid cells can be suitable for routine diagnosis of occult HCV infection.",

RNA was reversely transcribed by using MMLV-RT. Expression of IFNc and TNFa was quantified by real-time RT-PCR using SYBR and the Roche LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics). Reactions were performed in 20-lL volumes (50 ng RNA) using sense primer 5\u00a2-TTTTCAGCTCTGCA-TCGTTTTGGGT and antisense primer 5\u00a2-CCTTGAAACAG-CATCTGACTCCTT for detection of IFNc and sense primer 5\u00a2-TCTTCTCGAACCCCGAGTGA and antisense primer 5\u00a2-CCT-CTGATGGCACCACCAG for detection of TNFa. The expression of the genes was normalized against that of GAPDH, which was quantified in parallel in each set of test samples. Specificity of amplifications was confirmed by a melting curve analysis. The presence of primer dimers hindered the use of realtime RT-PCR to accurately quantify IFNa5 and IFN-inducible MxA. Therefore, the conventional RT-PCR/NAH tests were applied. This was followed by densitometric analysis of the resulting hybridization signals using cloned IFNa5 and MxA DNA fragments as quantitative standards. Amplification of IFNa5 was done with sense primer 5\u00a2-GGTCACTCA-ATCTCAACAGC and antisense primer 5\u00a2-ATATGGATCCT-GATTTCTGCTCTGACAACC, whereas that of MxA with sense primer 5\u00a2-GCATCCCACCCTCTATTACT and antisense primer 5\u00a2-TGTCTTCAGTTCCTTTGTCC. PCR mixtures were amplified for 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 10 s, then at 58\u00b0C (for IFNa5) or 47\u00b0C (for MxA) for 30 s, and finally at 72\u00b0C for 1 min. As a loading control, GAPDH was amplified by using cDNA derived from the same test samples using sense primer 5\u00a2-CCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAG and antisense primer 5\u00a2-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTG for 27 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 52\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min in a PTC-200 thermocycler (MJR Research, Watertown, MA, USA). Specificity of IFN5a, MxA and GADPH amplicons, and validity of the controls were routinely verified by NAH using as probes respective gene recombinant DNA fragments labelled with 32 P-dCTP (GE Healthcare, QC, Canada).",

By testing the first set of the samples using the RT-PCR/NAH assay, 82.3% of sera (14/17) and 52.9% of naive PBMC (9/17) were found reactive for HCV RNA positive strand (Table 1) . Twelve months later, 84.2% of sera and 50% of naive PBMC were identified to be positive for HCV RNA by RT-PCR/NAH. The estimated levels of HCV RNA were around 40-200 vge/mL in serum and 5-50 vge/lg of total RNA for most of the PBMC samples tested (Group 2a; Table 1) . Surprisingly, the second lymphoid cell samples collected 3-5 years after SVR from three of the individuals carried HCV RNA at levels ranging from 1 \u00b7 10 3 to 7 \u00b7 10 3 vge/lg total RNA (Group 2b; Table 1 ), which were comparable with those typically detected in PBMC from symptomatic CHC (Pham and Michalak, unpubl. data). Interestingly, HCV RNA levels in their sera were similar to those found in the other recovered persons. The presence of HCV RNA negative strand, indicative of active viral replication, was detected in 62.5% of the first and 70% of the second naive (mitogen-untreated) lymphoid cells, which were found to be reactive for the viral RNA positive strand and were available for testing (Table 1) . For the 17 cases with two samples collected, HCV RNA was detected at both occasions in sera of 12 of them (70.6%). Further, although in five individuals HCV RNA was detected in the first but not in the subsequent PBMC sample, the reverse was true in five other subjects.",

As illustrated in Fig. 2 , consistent single nucleotide differences at specific positions were detected between serum and PBMC obtained at the same time point of follow-up, as well as between serum and PBMC collected from the same individual at the two occasions. For example, while a guanidine at position 186 (G186) and an adenine at positions 192 (A192) and 231 (A231) were detected in all the clones derived from Serum-2 of Case 19, a thymidine (T186), cytosine (C192), and guanidine (G231), respectively, were found in the clones from PBMC-2 sample. In Case 20, two single nucleotide polymorphisms T186G and C192A were identified when HCV clones from Serum-1 were compared with those from PBMC-1. Interestingly, sequences of HCV detected in Serum-2 obtained 1 year later from this individual, except for a few random mutations in some of the clones, were identical to those found in PBMC-1 sample. Further, when sequences obtained from PBMC-2 were compared with those of Serum-2, three substitutions G186T, A192T and A231G were detected in all of the clones examined (Fig. 2 ). In addition, there were changes in the 5\u00a2-UTR sequence when serum or PBMC from the first collection was compared with those obtained at the second collection. Specifically, relative to the sequences found in the respective samples from the first collection, T186G and C192A mutations were identified in the second serum sample, while G186T, A192T and A231G substitutions found in the second PBMC. Overall, these findings revealed the existence of minor but evident variations between the circulating virus and that residing in the PBMC. They also showed that over time the 5\u00a2-UTR sequence underwent slight but clearly identifiable changes.",

            "text": "In our previous study, synergistic stimulation of T and B lymphocytes with appropriate mitogens augmented HCV replication leading to more frequent identification of the virus genome compared with PBMC treated with a single mitogen [5] . In the present work, to further increase likelihood of identification of HCV, viral RNA was examined after exposure of both lymphocytes and monocytes to mitogen cocktails. Thus, the second PBMC samples were treated with either C5, which activated T and B cells, or C5L, which also stimulated monocytes and macrophages. Both treatments led to enhanced expression of HCV RNA-positive strand, despite the fact that some of these samples were apparently HCV RNA-negative or carried very low HCV loads prior to mitogen stimulation, as illustrated in Fig. 3a and Table 1 . It is of note that, considering densitometric values given by the respective hybridization signals, C5L was at least twice more effective in upregulating HCV RNA expression than C5 (Fig. 3a) . The fact that C5L, but not C5, led to identification of viral RNA in PBMC from Patients 6 and 7 (Fig. 3a) suggested that monocytes were a predominant, if not the only reservoir of the persisting virus among circulating PBMC in these two individuals at the time of investigation. However, the synergistic activation of lymphocytes and monocytes occasionally led to almost complete inhibition of HCV RNA expression. This was evident in Patients 11 and 12 (Table 1) in which HCV RNA expression was increased by 20-100fold following stimulation of T and B lymphocytes with C5, while activation of both lymphocytes and monocytes with C5L resulted in a dramatic downregulation of HCV RNA presence. This observation implied that ex vivo treatments of lymphoid cells with both C5 and C5L were required to more accurately identify the existence of occult HCV infection.",

As shown in Fig. 5b , an upregulation of HCV RNA following mitogen stimulation (Cases 6 and 13; Fig. 3 and Table 1 ) was associated with a down-regulation of MxA in lymphoid cells. Similarly, in the two cases ( Cases  18 and 19) , where a significant inhibition of HCV replication after mitogen treatment was observed ( Fig. 4 and Table 1 ), a marked increase in the amount of MxA transcripts was found. Such an inverse correlation between HCV load and MxA expression was consistent with that between HCV RNA and IFNa mRNA. However, it is of note that as MxA mRNA was detected with a relatively higher sensitivity than IFNa5 mRNA, mitogen-treated lymphoid cells from one healthy individual were found to be positive for MxA mRNA despite the apparent absence of IFNa5 expression.

            "text": "In our previous studies, persistence of low levels of HCV RNA in individuals followed for years after they had been considered cured of hepatitis C, based on the results of standard laboratory assays for HCV RNA and normal liver function tests, was documented [5, 6] . Similar findings were subsequently reported by other groups by examining both lymphoid cells [7, 8, 21] and liver tissue fragments [8, 21, 22] . In this clinically silent form of HCV persistence, T and B lymphocytes were found to carry replicating HCV genomes [5] . In the present study, it has been demonstrated that cells of the monocytic lineage also are a reservoir of HCV replication in occult infection. This finding is consistent with a recent observation made in another laboratory [21] , which showed the presence of HCV RNA in cultured monocytes from individuals with resolved hepatitis C. The current study, for the first time, documents the existence of a reverse relation between HCV load and expression of IFNa in lymphoid cells in the course of occult HCV infection. In addition, it was found that the level of HCV RNA in naive lymphoid cells during occult persistence is a predictor of whether ex vivo stimulation will enhance or abrogate viral replication in these cells. Specifically, when the level of HCV RNA in naive circulating lymphoid cells is equal to or >10 3 vge/lg total RNA (10-15 lg of RNA is typically recovered from 1 \u00b7 10 7 lymphoid cells), stimulation of the cells leads to drastic inhibition in HCV replication. However, under the same treatment conditions, augmentation of HCV replication is usually observed in cells carrying around 5-50 vge/lg total RNA. Subsequent analysis showed that the level of IFNa transcription, but not that of IFNc or TNFa, is relevant to the control of HCV replication in lymphoid cells during occult infection.",

In all three cases, there was no apparent correlation between HCV level in lymphoid cells and in serum, which was in the range of 40-200 vge/ mL. This indicates that relatively high HCV loads in lymphoid cells can occur in individuals with permanently low serum HCV RNA, albeit most likely transiently as PBMC samples collected a year before from the same persons contained low HCV loads, comparable with those detected in other individuals with persistent occult infection investigated in this study. A similar observation was made in occult hepadnaviral infection in the woodchuck model of hepatitis B where the number of circulating lymphoid cells carrying WHV genome was measured by in situ PCR followed by flow cytometric detection of positive cells [38] . The results of this study demonstrated that the number of virus-reactive lymphoid cells in either primary or secondary occult WHV infection can be occasionally as high as that in symptomatic, serologically evident chronic hepatitis.",

            "text": "Ex vivo stimulation of lymphoid cells with high HCV loads obtained from the individuals with occult infection resulted in at least 90% inhibition of HCV RNA expression after treatment with C5 in two cases and virtually complete abrogation of viral expression in all three cases after expo-sure of the cells to C5L (Fig. 4) . The fact that the levels of the housekeeping GAPDH gene remained similar in untreated and mitogen-treated samples ruled out the possibility that the mitogen-cytokine cocktails might have caused cell death or random changes to viral RNA expression. We subsequently assessed the transcriptional activity of selected antiviral cytokines in both naive and stimulated lymphoid cells to assess whether these cytokines may be of relevance to HCV replication. It is of note that IFNa5 was selected for this investigation as it has been reported that this isoform of IFNa, one of the 13 members of the IFNa family, was found to be predominantly induced in circulating lymphoid cells [39] but downregulated in hepatic tissue [40] of patients with CHC. The results of our analysis showed that a down-regulation of HCV RNA was closely correlated with an increase in the level of IFNa5 expression. Conversely, augmentation of HCV replication paralleled a decrease in the intracellular IFNa5 mRNA level (Fig. 5) . Demonstration of a similar relation between HCV RNA load and of IFN-stimulated MxA confirmed that activation of the IFNa signalling pathway most likely plays a pivotal role in the control of HCV replication in lymphoid cells in the course of occult infection. In contrast, neither IFNc nor TNFa expression appeared to have any direct association with the rate of HCV replication. Such an antiviral effect of endogenous IFNa against viral pathogens replicating in lymphoid cells is not exclusive to HCV, as similar observations have been made in both in vivo and in vitro settings for human herpesvirus-8 [41] , dengue virus [42] and West Nile virus [43] . Our findings and those reported for patients with CHC [39] collectively suggest that HCV infection does not seem to impede the production of IFNa in lymphoid cells, unlike that with hepatitis B virus [44] or HIV [45] . What however remains unknown, and will require a separate study, is the interplay between HCV and the host machinery mediating activation of lymphoid cells in response to mitogen treatment. Deciphering the underlying molecular mechanisms would be of importance as the amount of HCV residing in lymphoid cells appears to predetermine the outcome of mitogen stimulation in regard to IFNa expression and whether subsequently HCV replication is augmented, suppressed or even aborted in these cells. Understanding of this issue may have a direct impact not only on the designing practical approaches for detection of occult HCV infection, but also on individualized methods of induction on HCV clearance in particular virological situations.",
