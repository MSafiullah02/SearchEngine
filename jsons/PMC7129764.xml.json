It remains a major cause of admission to hospital and mortality in developed countries, and contributes significantly to excessive consumption of healthcare resources and related costs [1, 2, 3, 4]. Pneumonia has always been an active field of investigation, given its relevance and complexity. In the past decade, significant progress has been made in understanding the aetiology and outcomes of patients with CAP. Chlamydia pneumoniae has emerged as a significant independent and co-infecting pathogen [5, 6], and epidemiological research has provided prognostic and clinicaldecision support tools [7], as well as critical pathways to optimise the healthcare process [8]. In addition, the benefits resulting from immunisation of specific patient groups with pneumococcal polysaccharide have led to recommendations for the use of this vaccine in patients at risk for CAP [9].",

The selection of empirical therapy has become complicated by increasing concern regarding the concurrent presence of \u2018atypical\u2019 pathogens (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia spp., Coxiella burnetii and Legionella pneumophila) in a significant proportion of cases thought previously to be caused by a single pathogen [5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], and by the marked rise of \u03b2-lactam and macrolide resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. While most studies suggest that current levels of \u03b2-lactam resistance do not usually result in treatment failures among patients with pneumococcal pneumonia [19, 20], therapeutic failures attributable to macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae have been reported among patients treated with an oral macrolide who required admission subsequently with S. pneumoniae bacteraemia [21, 22]. However, the availability of newer fluoroquinolones with greater activity against S. pneumoniae and other respiratory pathogens, as well as novel immunochromatographic assays to detect S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila antigens in urine, have facilitated the medical management of CAP [23, 24, 25].",

The aim of the present work was to provide a comprehensive overview of the current clinical and epidemiological features of CAP by conducting a prospective population-based study with two major advantages: (1) the inclusion of consecutive patients covering a broad clinical spectrum of CAP; and (2) an extensive microbiological workup, including detection of urinary antigen for S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila, and standard serological tests and criteria for atypical and virus pathogens. A previous report evaluated the Binax immunochromatographic assay for detection of S. pneumoniae urinary antigen in the same patient cohort [32]. The present study presents a complete analysis of the epidemiological features, microbial diagnosis and outcome for these patients.",

All adult patients (\u2265 15 years) from this Health Authority with signs and symptoms compatible with pneumonia over the 24-month study period were eligible for inclusion in the study. The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee. Attending clinicians were asked to consider the possibility of pneumonia in any patient with an acute illness and symptoms suggesting lower respiratory tract infection, including a new cough with high fever or chills, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea or prolonged fever. Patients were evaluated clinically and roentgenographically, and those with a provisional diagnosis of CAP were seen by a study investigator to confirm the diagnosis. CAP was defined as an acute illness associated with at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever, new cough with or without sputum production, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea or altered breath sound on auscultation, plus a chest radiograph showing an opacity compatible with the presence of acute pneumonia. Patients who had been hospitalised previously within 2 weeks of a current diagnosis of pneumonia were excluded.",

The older age of the population may have accounted in part for the higher proportion of patients admitted to hospital compared with other population-based studies carried out in the last decade. In the present study, dementia emerged as a significant co-morbid illness in patients with CAP, ranking after chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes mellitus. Pneumonia is one of the most serious medical conditions seen in late-stage dementia, and is a common cause of death in these patients [40]. The high prevalence of dementia observed in the present study is probably related to population ageing, which was also reflected in the older age of the patients included in the study. Although Alzheimer's disease is an increasing problem in the elderly, affecting 4.5 million individuals in the USA alone [41], the presence of dementia was not found to be a major risk factor for CAP in epidemiological studies published in the last decade. However, a recent study of CAP in patients aged \u2265 80 years admitted to hospital found that dementia was the fourth most common underlying disease after chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic heart disease and diabetes mellitus [42]. Patients with dementia may be particularly susceptible to pneumonia because of their swallowing difficulties and the use of sedative medications, which are factors that have been found to increase the risk of pneumonia in elderly patients living in long-term care facilities [43, 44]. The problem of pneumonia in patients with dementia may be more serious in the future in view of forecasts of a continued increase in the number of individuals with Alzheimer's disease [41].",

However, neither non-serological tests for viruses (e.g., immunofluorescence, virus culture) nor nucleic acid amplification techniques were used, and no attempt was made to look for emerging viruses, such as coronavirus, human metapneumovirus or hantavirus. The results obtained showed a high proportion of patients with pneumococcal CAP. S. pneumoniae was the most frequent organism identified, both in outpatients and in patients requiring admission to hospital, and it was also the most frequent pathogen involved in mixed infections and in fatal cases. This finding concurs with the results of previous studies of hospitalised patients [8], but the frequency of S. pneumoniae in outpatients has varied widely [6, 27, 28, 29, 35, 38, 45]. Some studies have identified atypical organisms, such as M. pneumoniae [6, 28] and C. pneumoniae [35], or viruses [46], more frequently than S. pneumoniae, but these differences probably reflect the different populations studied and the types of diagnostic test performed.",

This observation agrees with the results of other studies in which M. pneumoniae has accounted for up to 60% of all atypical pathogens [5, 29, 47], reinforcing the pivotal role of this organism in CAP. In contrast, the importance of C. pneumoniae is not yet completely understood. In the last few years, C. pneumoniae has been identified with increasing frequency in some studies, reaching a proportion comparable to and ever higher than that of Mycoplasma [34, 47], but has been found rarely in other cohorts [28, 29]. The lack of a reference standard for diagnosis, combined with the occurrence of epidemic outbreaks during some studies, may account in part for the wide variations in the reported incidence rates. In order to determine the significance of C. pneumoniae as a cause of pneumonia in a population, it is critical to use standard diagnostic tests and criteria, and to perform studies for a sufficient length of time to avoid any seasonal bias. The present study used CDC criteria [48] for diagnosing definite acute infection by serology, and patients were recruited over a 2-year period. According to the results, C. pneumoniae is a significant pathogen in CAP, but its frequency is lower than that of M. pneumoniae, and much lower than that found in other pneumonia studies [6, 34, 47].",

Overall, the prevalence of CAP caused by atypical organisms was highest among young adults and patients without co-morbidities, reflecting the epidemiological pattern of Mycoplasma and Chlamydia infections. In contrast, pneumonias caused by Legionella were seen with similar frequency in young and older individuals, and in patients with or without co-morbidities. Although Mycoplasma and Chlamydia infections were more common in the youngest patients, 22% of all cases of pneumonia caused by these organisms occurred in patients aged > 65 years. These findings agree with other studies reporting significant incidence rates of CAP caused by atypical pathogens in the elderly [49] and in patients with co-morbidities [50]. With regard to the aetiological distribution according to underlying diseases, S. pneumoniae held the leading position in all groups, while there was a significant association between Pseudomonas spp. and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Cases of staphylococcal pneumonia among diabetic patients were not observed.",

The incidence of CAP caused by atypical pathogens, including M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae, was highest among outpatients, but was also high among hospitalised patients. The importance of M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae and Legionella in pneumonias requiring hospitalisation has been highlighted in several previous studies of CAP [30, 51, 52]. Although atypical pathogens other than Legionella spp. have usually been associated with mild-to-moderate illness, severe cases requiring admission to an intensive care unit have also been reported [53]. In the CBPIS study [30], pneumonia caused by M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae accounted for between 8% (using criteria for definite diagnosis) and 35% (using criteria for possible diagnosis) of all patients with pneumonia who required hospitalisation. A recent study found that CAP patients aged \u2265 60 years with Chlamydia infection had the highest hospitalisation rate, leading to the suggestion that pneumonia caused by Chlamydia can rival even pneumococcal pneumonia for severity [47]. However, little information was actually available on the severity at presentation of atypical pneumonia using a validated prognostic tool. The results of the present study, using the validated PORT prediction rule for 30-day mortality and medical complications to quantify severity of illness at presentation, suggest that the severity of CAP caused by atypical organisms may have been overestimated. Indeed, most patients with CAP caused by M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae had a disease of low severity, and all such patients had a favourable outcome. According to current recommendations [2], most of these cases should probably have been treated at home.",

Recent population-based data show that most cases of Legionella infection probably present as mild-to-moderate disease, rather than severe pneumonia [58, 59]. In the largest outbreak of Legionnaires\u2019 disease to date, with more than 800 cases reported, one-third of the patients were managed as outpatients and a case fatality rate of only 1.1% was observed [58]. In the present population-based study using the PORT classification, of 21 cases of Legionnaires\u2019 disease, 15 (71.4%) were classified within \u2018low-severity\u2019 and six (28.6%) within \u2018high-severity\u2019 risk classes.

Thus, patients with CAP are often classified into groups, each with a list of likely pathogens and a suggested empirical therapy, based on stratification according to age, place of therapy, co-morbidity and severity [1, 2, 3]. The present data confirmed that microbial diagnosis varies according to epidemiological factors, but there was too much overlap between groups for this information to be used as a guide for therapeutic decisions. Selection of empirical therapy is complicated further by the marked increase in \u03b2-lactam and macrolide resistance among isolates of S. pneumoniae, and by the increasing concern about mixed infections [5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. A low proportion of cases of CAP in the present study were considered to be of mixed aetiology. Mixed infections were seen across all age groups, including elderly patients, and in both hospitalised patients and outpatients [29, 30, 34].",

In addition, recent data suggest an advantage in using an empirical \u03b2-lactam\u2013macrolide combination, rather than monotherapy, for the treatment of CAP that is associated subsequently with pneumococcal bacteraemia [16, 17, 64]. However, all of these investigations were retrospective, with design limitations and several sources of bias [65]. In the present study, combined therapy was not associated with a better outcome in the multivariate analysis when compared with monotherapy. Although the frequent involvement of pneumococci in mixed pneumonias would support a role for dual therapy in pneumococal infection, no association was demonstrated between combined antibiotic therapy and outcome in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. Although these findings may argue against the use of dual therapy in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, the results should be interpreted with caution because the relatively small size of the groups affects the power and general applicability of the findings. In addition, as stated in the updated guidelines for CAP from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [2], until such time as a prospective, randomised trial clarifies this issue, identification of pneumococci should not prevent clinicians from pursuing other diagnostic possibilities (e.g., an \u2018atypical\u2019 co-pathogen), especially when the pneumonia is not responding to treatment.",

For patients requiring hospitalisation, the 6.6% mortality rate resembles the rate of 8.8% in the CBPIS study [30], but is lower than other figures reported previously, which have averaged 12% [3]. Age, disease severity and underlying disease, as reflected by the PSI prediction rule, were factors that affected outcome. Indeed, mortality varied according to the PSI, with most fatal cases occurring in patients classified within risk classes IV and V. Although several variables were associated with mortality in the univariate analysis, only shock, an age > 65 years and an altered mental status were associated independently with increased mortality. As stated above, no association was found in multivariate analysis between mortality and either monotherapy or combination antibiotic therapy.",

The study confirmed that microbial diagnosis of CAP remains problematic, and that the aetiology still cannot be identified in a considerable proportion of cases. Although certain epidemiological features may help to predict the microbial aetiology, the overlap between groups reduces the usefulness of this information in guiding therapeutic decisions. New microbiological techniques are required to improve the ability of laboratories to detect microbial pathogens causing CAP.",
