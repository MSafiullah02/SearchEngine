Changes in annual values with time were analysed by ordinary linear regression, with the F test for significance, for 1977e1994 and 1995e2016 periods, and with combined data, an interaction term was used to test for the difference in the slopes between the two periods. Fig. 1 shows that the climate in South East England has become milder over the recent decades and that deaths from influenza have generally decreased since the large epidemic that occurred in 1976. The percentage of women exceeds that of men in both age groups, with the percentage of the 65-to 74-year-old group declining and that of the group older than 85 years growing. Fig. 2 shows that the annual increase in all-cause mortality per 1 C fall in temperature continued to decline over the latest 1995e2016 period. Similar results were seen with major causes of mortality, IHD and CVD, although slightly less for RES. Estimates of mortality at 18 C, an approximate temperature at which both the effects of heat and cold are minimal, also continued to decline. However, significant declines in IHD and all-cause annual specific mortality in the 1977e1994 period were not seen in the 1995e2016 period. Fig. 3 shows changes in men and women, and separately for each sex, in the age category above 85 years. In the earlier 1977e1994 period, the declines in all-cause mortality, coldrelated mortality, 18 C mortality and specific mortality were similar to those seen in the younger age groups. Worryingly, in the more recent 1995e2016 period, mortality per 1 C fall in temperature, mortality at 18 C and specific cold-related mortality have risen significantly in women (P < 0.01).",

Consequently, as a percentage, there was no significant change in specific mortality (the percentage of cold-related mortality). RES now contributes to most cold-related deaths, despite influenza immunisation, but other clinically important respiratory viruses such as coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses and rhinoviruses still circulate in wintertime. The absence of any decline in specific mortality particularly after the introduction of winter fuel payments (a state benefit paid to all pensioners to help with heating costs) in 1997 could be due to a trend towards wearing more casual but less warm clothing and elderly people spending more time outdoors where they are exposed to the cold.",
