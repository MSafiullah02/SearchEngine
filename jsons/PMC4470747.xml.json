            "text": "Several emerging and re-emerging RNA viruses have been the cause of several national and international epidemics within the past few years. These pathogens are no longer confined within national or even regional boundaries, and have become cause for global concern. In the summer of 2012, an outbreak of the flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States, which since its discovery in 1937 has become endemic to all continents on earth except Antarctica, resulted in over 1800 cases in the state of Texas alone [1]. Moreover, recent epidemiological evidence has distinguished the emergence of novel Lineage 2 WNV isolates as the cause of several human outbreaks in Europe, which prior to 2011 was thought to be of low virulence to humans [2]. Later in 2012, the Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) emerged in Saudi Arabia. In April 2014, an outbreak of over 300 cases of MERS occurred in Saudi Arabia (WHO, 2014), and has since spread to other countries in Europe. The US MERS-CoV shows similarity to the Severe Acute Respiratory-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused an epidemic of over 8000 cases in 2003 (World Health Organization, 2010). In March 2014, an outbreak of Ebolavirus (EBOV) began in West Africa, and has since caused over 9100 deaths (CDC, 2015) in Africa and now to other parts of the world. In December 2013, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a member of the Alphavirus family, was detected in the for the first time Western Hemisphere within Caribbean nations, and a few months later spread to both North and South America (CDC, 2014) [3]. Given the increase in global travel, international commerce and possible effects of climate change, we will continue to observe the emergence and re-emergence of viral strains that are of significant concern to human health worldwide.",

Activation of the host innate immune response begins with recognition of pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Activation of host PRRs by non-self nucleic acids such as those found in RNA viruses trigger a signaling cascade resulting in the production of type I Interferon (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and expression of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that target specific aspects of the viral life cycle, including virus binding to attachment receptors, virus entry, RNA synthesis, progeny virion assembly, and egress. In this review, we will discuss mechanisms by which emerging and re-emerging viruses utilize to evade PRR detection and inhibit innate immune signaling.",

            "text": "Many RNA viruses assemble replication complexes and drive viral RNA synthesis within a virally induced enclosed organelle inside the host cell. These membrane vesicles, also termed viroplasm-like structures (VLS), are thought to shield nascent viral RNAs from activating the RLRs during RNA synthesis [6] and have been found in various RNA viruses including CoV and flaviviruses (Table 1\n). Flavivirus-induced viroplasms contain RNA polymerase, nonstructural (NS) proteins NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) [7\u2022]. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed viral replication and virus budding occur within viroplasm and VLSs in Dengue virus (DENV)-infected mosquito cells [8], thus indicating these sites to be important for viral replication. Moreover, WNV, DENV and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genomic RNA become sensitive to nuclease treatment after disruption of these membrane vesicles [9], which indicates these structures shield the viral genome from endogenous RNA degrading processes in the cytosol. It has also been suggested that membrane vesicle protection of viral RNA delays onset of IFN responses, but has not been definitively shown. A recent study utilizing flaviviruses JEV and DENV correlated high amounts of cytosolic JEV RNA with robust IFN\u03b2 production and low amounts of cytosolic DENV RNA with weak IFN\u03b2 production [10]. However, this work still does not directly address whether flavivirus viroplasms prevent IFN production. Interestingly, the Influenza virus (IAV), which causes annual seasonal epidemics worldwide, replicates within the nucleus of infected cells away from cytosolic RLRs and TLRs [11\u2022\u2022]. Nonetheless, additional studies are warranted to elucidate the significance of viroplasm and VLSs to viral pathogenesis.",

Multiple RNA viruses have evolved enzymatic processes that catalyze post-translational modification of nascent mRNAs that effectively mask viral PAMPs by mimicking eukaryotic RNA structures. These processes include the addition of 5\u2032 cap structures similar to eukaryotic \u2018Type 1 caps\u2019 composed of a GMP-bound diphosphate moiety bound to the N-terminus of the transcribed mRNA molecule (GpppN-RNA) with methyl groups at guanine residues at the N-7 and ribose 2\u2032-O position (m7GpppNm-RNA). These post-translational modifications are catalyzed by phosphatases and methyltransferases (MTases). Studies examining various viral pathogens have demonstrated that loss of these post-translational modifications via mutating virally encoded phosphatases and MTases leads to decreased viral replication and enhancement of host antiviral responses. Notably, a recent study using SARS-CoV lacking Nsp16, which acts as a 2\u2032 O-MTase, showed that loss of 2\u2032 O-methylation of the SARS-CoV genome enhanced host type I IFN production [13]. Moreover, mutant JEV strains lacking the 2\u2032-O MTase are attenuated compared to wildtype JEV strains [14\u2022]. Therefore, post-translational modification of viral mRNA is an effective immunoevasion strategy that prevents induction of host antiviral processes.

In particular, IAV and other negative-strand segmented viruses such as Bunyaviruses have been shown to utilize this mechanism of \u2018cap snatching\u2019 [15]. IAV RNA polymerase complexes with PB1, an endonuclease with cap binding activity that captures a N7 methylguanosine 5\u2032 cap from host cellular pre-mRNA transcribed by host RNA polymerase II as a means to generate primers required for initiation of viral RNA transcription [16]. A similar endonuclease is also found in Bunyaviruses encoded by the l-protein [15]. The presence of this 5\u2032 cap is important for initiation of viral transcription during replication, maintaining RNA stability, and cap-dependent translation as well as evading detection by cytosolic PRRs.",

This reaction is catalyzed by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25 [20]. The multifunctional NS1 protein of IAV and NS protein of Bunyavirus Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome virus (SFTSV) both target TRIM25. IAV NS1 interacts directly with TRIM25, thus reducing RIG-I polyubiquitination [21, 22]. Studies by Rajsbaum et al. also implicated NS1 in interacting with and inhibiting Riplet, an E3 ligase that polyubiquitinates the C-terminal region of RIG-I [22]. Thus IAV NS1 exerts multiple mechanisms in suppressing RIG-I ubiquitination. In contrast, SFTSV exerts a different mechanism to antagonize RIG-I. SFTSV encodes NS protein that sequesters RIG-I, TRIM25 and TBK1 into cytoplasmic structures similar to the aforementioned viroplasms to inhibit RIG-I triggering of type I IFN [23, 24, 25]. SFTSV NS proteins can inhibit IFN\u03b2 promoter activation, and was shown to induce re-localization of RIG-I, TRIM25 and TBK1 into cytoplasmic structures that resemble inclusion bodies. Therefore RNA viruses are able to directly suppress PRR activation as a mode of immune evasion.",

The DENV NS2B/NS3 protease complex can directly cleave human STING, but not its mouse homologue MPYS [26\u2022\u2022, 27, 28]. YFV NS4B, like DENV NS4B, displays similar homology to the catalytic domain found on the N-terminus of STING that is required for its function, and by association it was speculated that YFV NS4B also inhibits STING [29]. Indeed, YFV NS4B was found to co-localize with human STING via confocal microscopy, but functional inhibition of STING by YFV NS4B has still yet to be confirmed. In contrast, NS4B of another flavivirus, Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was experimentally demonstrated to inhibit STING [30, 31]. It is unclear whether HCV NS4B also cleaves STING, yet it is likely that STING inhibition via NS4B is conserved among all flaviviruses, including YFV.",

CoV PLPs can inhibit the dimerization of STING, which is required for its activation, as well as inhibit its ability to form complexes with MAVS and IKK\u025b [33]. CoV PLPs can also decrease the ubiquitination of STING as well as RIG-I, TBK1 and IRF3, but interestingly does not require ubiquitin catalytic activity to reduce ubiquitinylation on STING [32, 33]. Likewise inhibition of proteolytic activity does not affect CoV PLPs from inhibiting type I IFN production. Thus the exact mechanism of how PLP domains within CoV nsp3 can antagonize cytosolic STING and inhibit IFN production requires further investigation.",

A recent study illustrated that a single Threonine to Isoleucine mutation at position 588 (T588I) increased IAV PB2's ability to bind MAVS and inhibit type I IFN production [36]. These mutations were originally isolated in swine IAV variants, but also found in the H1N1 IAV that caused the 2009 pandemic. This implicates PB2 as a potent antagonist of MAVS that may have broader functions in determining the virulence of IAV strains. MAVS is also inhibited by the actions of HCV protease NS3 and its required cofactor NS4A [37, 38]. HCV NS3/NS4A was shown to cleave MAVS at Cysteine-508 and is a potent inhibitor of IFN\u03b2.

PKR is a nonspecific dsRNA sensor that can turn on TBK1/IKK\u025b and downstream IFN production, among other functions. IAV NS1 can inhibit PKR-mediated type I IFN production in two manners: first, binding to PACT and preventing its interaction with PKR [46, 47] or second, directly binding to PKR [46, 48]. In addition, PACT directly activates and sustains RIG-I activation independent of Dicer and PKR via binding to the C-terminal domain of RIG-I and stimulating its ATPase activity [49]. Both IAV NS1 and EBOV VP35 have also been shown to block RIG-I activation through interaction with PACT. IAV NS1 binds PACT directly through its RNA binding domain, and is able to interfere with PACT interactions with RIG-I, thus reducing IFN\u03b2 production [47]. Similarly, EBOV VP35 binds to PACT via its C-terminal IFN inhibitory domain, which is sufficient to disrupt PACT:RIG-I interactions and subsequent IFN production [50]. Therefore, IAV NS1 and EBOV VP35 interactions with PACT interfere with type I IFN production by suppressing dsRNA-binding proteins PKR and RIG-I. Thus viral inhibition of type I IFN production via PACT can occur through PKR-dependent or PKR-independent means.",

The RISC includes first, the endonuclease Argonaute 2 (Ago2); second, dsRNA binding partners Transactivation response RNA binding protein (TRBP) and PACT; and third, the unwound strand of siRNA serving as the \u2018guide strand\u2019 that identifies ssRNA transcripts with complementary sequence as a target for degradation [51\u2022] (Figure 1). Several RNA viruses encode proteins that antagonize the mammalian RNAi pathway. EBOV nonstructural proteins VP30, VP40 and VP35 have been identified as mammalian RNAi suppressors, with VP35 exhibiting the most potent antagonistic function [52, 53]. VP35 readily immunoprecipitates with Dicer, TRBP and PACT, while VP30 only interacts with Dicer and TRBP. The ability of VP35 and VP30 to interact with TRBP and PACT also implicated their participation in inhibiting RIG-I signaling and the IFN production pathway, as both TRBP and PACT regulate PKR [54]. IAV NS1 has also been identified as a suppressor of eukaryotic RNAi. Similar to EBOV VP35, IAV NS1 can also bind PACT within the RNAi pathway, but also affects type I IFN production by disrupting PACT:RIG-I interactions [46, 47]. Recently, DENV NS4B has also been implicated in suppressing Dicer-dependent RNAi activation [55]. Specifically, NS4B could inhibit in vitro conversion of dsRNA to siRNA by Dicer. Transient knockdown of the central components of endogenous RNAi (e.g. Dicer, Argonaute) enhanced DENV replication in Huh7 cells, which supports that mammalian RNAi limits viral pathogenesis of DENV.",

Few mammalian siRNA/microRNAs (miRNAs) specific to viral mRNA have been identified, and there is conflicting evidence as to whether RNAi components are directly required to limit viral pathogenesis. A previous study by Schopman et al. conducted deep-sequencing of HIV-infected T cells to identify various HIV-specific siRNAs that inhibited HIV replication, representing the first convincing report of mammalian RNAi as an antiviral mechanism [56]. Two studies identified mammalian RNAi mechanisms from cells infected with mosquito-borne Nodamura virus (NoV) [57, 58]. Specifically, NoV encodes a suppressor of mammalian RNAi, B2, and functional B2 was required for NoV replication in hamster and mice [57]. However, a study by Seo and colleagues observed that mammalian RISC formation was inhibited by poly I:C and other viruses that triggered TLRs and RLRs, which argues that at least in some contexts, mammalian RNAi may not function as an antiviral process [59]. Thus to date, it is still unknown whether mammalian RNAi is a primary antiviral pathway to curtail virus replication.",

This leads to recruitment of janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), which phosphorylate transcription factors signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 and 2. STAT1 and STAT2 form a complex with IRF9, which translocates to the nucleus to initiate transcription of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) (Figure 2\n). IFN antagonists have been well-characterized in a number of RNA viruses, and target multiple components of the IFNAR signaling pathway. Flaviviruses JEV and WNV inhibit phosphorylation and activation of JAK1 via NS5 and NS4B, respectively [60, 61]. WNV NS4B also inhibits phosphorylation and activation of TYK2 [60]. Viral IFN antagonism is also mediated through induction of the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) 1 and 3 that negatively regulate JAK1. Flaviviruses WNV and JEV both induce transcriptional expression of SOCS1/3 early after infection [62, 63] in addition to other mechanisms. Likewise, CHIKV and EBOV both induce increased expression of SOCS1 [64\u2022, 65]. Finally, IAV NS1 also induces upregulation of SOCS1/3 [66, 67].",

DENV NS5 has also been shown to promote the proteosomal degradation of STAT2 [69, 73, 74]. Specifically, DENV NS5 directly binds STAT2 to UBR4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, to initiate the proteolytic degradation of STAT2 [74]. This suggests that other NS proteins may contribute to NS5-mediated targeting of STAT2 for proteolytic cleavage. Additionally, the structural (core and envelope, E) and nonstructural NS1-NS5 proteins of a pathogenic WNV strain (Tx-HC 2002) inhibits STAT1/2 phosphorylation and IFN production, and introduction of these proteins into a non-pathogenic strain of WNV (Madagascar 78) enhances IFN inhibition and virus-induced cytopathology [75\u2022].

CHIKV nsP2 does not induce degradation of STAT1/2 as observed in other viruses like DENV, and the mechanism for how CHIKV nsP2 inhibits STAT nuclear accumulation is unclear. IAV NS1 is also capable of downregulating STAT1/2 phosphorylation and inhibiting the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT1/2 [66, 78]. NS1 may hinder nuclear accumulation by disrupting phospho-STAT:DNA complexes that form and migrate to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription [66]. Interestingly, H5N1 and H1N1 IAV NS1 proteins can also downregulate expression of IFNAR 1 and 2 to inhibit type I IFN signaling [66]. Thus IAV NS1 mediates three modes of IFN signaling antagonism: first, upregulation of SOCS1/3 to diminish activation of JAK1/TYK2; second, inhibition of STAT1/2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation; and third, downregulation of IFNAR1/2 expression.",

Karyopherin \u03b11 belongs to a group of nuclear transport carriers that upon recognition of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of a nascent protein recruits Karyopherin \u03b21 (importin-1) to the complex. Ultimately the complex containing the nascent protein, Karyopherin \u03b11 and Karyopherin \u03b21 can cross the nuclear membrane. VP24 specifically binds to Karyopherin \u03b11 and other members of the Karyopherin \u03b1 subgroup and inhibits its interaction with phosphorylated STAT1 [79, 80]. This function was not observed for EBOV VP35, nor did VP24 affect upregulation of STAT1 expression. Therefore VP24 interactions with Karyopherin \u03b1 proteins limit STAT1 accumulation in the nucleus.",

First, SARS-CoV nsp1 inhibits STAT1 phosphorylation, but has little or no effect on STAT2, JAK1 or TYK2 phosphorylation [81]. This study did not examine whether nsp1 affects STAT1 nuclear transport, but two independent studies showed that SARS-CoV open reading frame 6 (ORF6) encodes accessory proteins that inhibit STAT1 nuclear translocation [44, 82]. Similar to EBOV VP24, SARS-CoV ORF6 also inhibited nuclear accumulation of STAT1 by sequestering Karyopherin \u03b12 at the ER/Golgi and preventing its interaction with cytosolic phospho-STAT1 [82]. ORF6 also relocalizes Karyopherin \u03b21 at the ER/Golgi membrane, thus inhibiting the formation of the STAT1:Karyopherin complex required for nuclear transport. Importantly, infection with MERS-CoV, which does not encode ORF6, does not inhibit nuclear translocation of phospho-STAT1 [83]. This illustrates a clear distinction between SARS and MERS-CoV, which may reflect differences in virulence and pathogenesis between these viruses.",

SARS PLP upregulates the expression of cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase E2-25k, which is upregulated by IFN\u03b1 signaling [84]. PLP transfection into human pro-monocytes significantly induced expression of cellular E2-25k. Increased E2-25k correlated with significantly decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) 1, but not Erk2, protein in the cell, which was mediated through ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic degradation of Erk1. The degradation of Erk1 was concomitant with decreased IFN\u03b1-dependent STAT1 and c-Jun phosphorylation. Thus SARS-CoV antagonizes STAT1 activity through three distinct mechanisms: first, nsp1-dependent inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation; second, ORF6-dependent sequestration of Karyopherin \u03b11 and STAT1 translocation; third, PLP-dependent induction of E2-25k to promote Erk1 degradation and decreased STAT1 phosphorylation.",

            "text": "The emergence and re-emergence of RNA viruses continues to pose a significant public health threat worldwide. However, few vaccines for use in humans or specific antiviral therapeutics exist for several emerging/re-emerging viruses, including SARS, MERS-CoV, WNV, or BUNV. Thus, it is crucially important to understand the virus\u2013host interactions that govern immunity, disease severity, and infection outcome. Recent findings have found that several viruses utilize multifaceted strategies to evade multiple arms of the innate immune response. Functionally pleiotropic suppressors such as IAV NS1 and EBOV VP35 reveal the complexity and level of sophistication by which these viral pathogens have developed as immune escape artists, but their nature as multifunctional antagonists also makes them attractive candidates in vaccines and therapeutics. For example, interventions that target IAV NS1 would suppress multiple IAV immunoevasion mechanisms, increasing the potential effectiveness of a candidate vaccine or therapy. Indeed, deletion mutants of IAV have already been tested in live attenuated vaccines in Phase I/II clinical trial, resulting in enhanced IAV-specific antibody responses [85\u2022\u2022]. With the ongoing Ebola epidemic in West Africa, it is tempting to imagine that targeting the multifunctional EBOV VP35 may lead to the development of effective therapeutics and even a possible vaccine. Most importantly, studies aimed at expanding our understanding of viral evasion strategies undoubtedly reveal new insights into innate immune signaling and host antiviral defenses. Indeed, discovery of the RIG-I signaling pathway led to the identification of viral factors that antagonize RLR signaling. As viral pathogens continue to cause threat of global epidemics, improved understanding of host defenses will be crucial to limiting the burden of human disease.",

(2) RIG-I activation requires binding to dsRNA and subsequent ubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligases, TRIM25 and Riplet. RIG-I is also independently activated by interactions with PACT. This signals through mitochondrial-bound MAVS, leading to TBK1/IKK\u025b activation to initiate transcription factors NF\u03baB, IRF3/IRF7. Additionally, PKR is activated by PACT or dsRNA binding, which also turns on TBK1/IKK\u025b independently of RIG-I activation. (3) The RNAi pathway involves Dicer conversion of dsRNA to siRNA. The siRNA recognizes its complementary sequence in the target mRNA molecule, which recruits the RISC comprised of Argonaute 2, PACT and TRBP. The resulting mRNA is proteolytically degraded.
