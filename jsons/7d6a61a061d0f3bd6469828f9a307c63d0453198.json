One of its units is ADP-ribose phosphatase domain (ADRP, also known as macrodomain) which is believed to interfere with the host immune response. Such a function appears to be linked to the protein's ability to remove ADP-ribose from ADP-ribosylated proteins and RNA, yet the precise role and molecular targets of the enzyme remains unknown. Here, we have determined five, high resolution (1.07 -2.01 \u00c5) crystal structures corresponding to the apo form of the protein and complexes with 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), AMP and ADPr. We show that the protein undergoes conformational changes to adapt to the ligand in a manner previously observed before for in close homologs from other viruses. We also identify a conserved water molecule that may participate in hydrolysis. This work builds foundations for future structure-based research of the ADRP, including search for potential antiviral therapeutics.",

As other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes positive-sense RNA genome encoding nonstructural proteins (Nsps), structural proteins, such as spike glycoprotein (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid proteins (N), as well accessory proteins (Wu et al., 2020) . Nsps are encompassed within ORF1a and ORF1b, that produce two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (Cui et al., 2019) . The latter protein results from the ribosomal shift that enables continuous translation of ORF1a along with ORF1b. Pp1a contains two viral proteases, 3C-like main protease (Mpro, encoded by Nsp5), and papain-like protease (PLpro, encoded within Nsp3), responsible for posttranslational processing of two polyproteins. The cleavage yields 16 Nsps (15 Nsps in SARS-CoV-2) (Baez-Santos et al., 2015) that form a large membrane-bound replicase complex.",

ADRP was identified thirty years ago by bioinformatics as a unique and conserved domain, initially termed X domain (Lee et al., 1991) , found in the genomes of Togaviridae, Coronaviridae, and Hepeviridae families. Since then it has been also discovered in Iridiviridae, Poxviridae and Myoviridae, which includes phages. Crystallographic model of the first ADRP (Saikatendu et al., 2005) enabled to the classification of the protein as a member of macroH2A-like family. The founding member of the family is a large, nonhistone part of the histone macroH2A, known as macrodomain (Pehrson & Fried, 1992) .

ARTD catalyze the transfer of either single (mono-ADP-ribosylation, MARylation) or multiple ADPr units (poly-ADP-ribosylation, PARylation, mostly PARP1 and PARP2), primarily onto glutamate/aspartate residues, but sometimes also serine. In nucleic acids, the modification is attached to phosphate group at the terminal ends of DNA/RNA. ARTCs carry out only MARylation and preferentially act on arginine. The de-ADPribosylation requires several enzymes. The polymeric fragment of the modification is removed by poly(ADP-ribosyl)glycohydrolase (PARG) while the final ADP-ribose unit is cut off from glutamate/aspartate residues by macrodomains.

The latter enzymes are upregulated by interferon, indicating their relevance in innate immune response. The systematic knockdown studies of all 17 mammalian PARP in the MHV model with macrodomain mutants implicated PARP12 and PARP14 in the control of virus replication (Grunewald et al., 2019) . Interestingly, PARP12, which is able to auto-ADP-ribosylate, belongs to a family of zinc finger CCCH domain known to bind to RNAs, including those of viral origin. The antiviral properties of the protein have been linked to its enzymatic activity, colocalization with polyribosomes via RNA-binding domain and interference with translation machinery (Atasheva et al., 2014) . Also, PARP10, known to modify RNA (Munnur et al., 2019) , has been shown to inhibit viral replication (Atasheva et al., 2012 , Atasheva et al., 2014 . The role of ADRP in jeopardizing immune response has also been emphasized by studies showing that viruses with mutated macrodomain replicated poorly in bonemarrow-derived macrophages, which are the primary cells mounting an innate immune response (Grunewald et al., 2019) . Along the same lines, viruses with deactivated macrodomains were sensitive to interferon (IFN) pretreatment (Kuri et al., 2011) .",

In the latter structure, though, the Gly46-Gly47 peptide bond has also an alternative conformation. Significant change is observed in ADRP/ADPr, where the loop has to rearrange to make main-chain amide nitrogen atoms accessible for interactions with ribose OH1' and OH2' groups. Finally, the geometry of \u03b26-(h3)-a5 loops and rotameric states of F132 and I131, contributing to P1-P2 and R2 sites, also adapts depending on the ligand identity.",

The primary reason for this is the flipping A129-G130 peptide bond, which in the absence of phosphate 2, or its mimetic, has the carbonyl group facing P2 site. Otherwise, with P2 occupied, the G130 amide group is hydrogen-bonded with the ligand, as described above. I131 and F132 are also observed in two states. With the R2 pocket empty or with MES, I131 adopts pt rotamer (p: plus, centered near +60\u00b0; t: trans, centered near 180\u00b0), while in the presence of a ribose ring, it turns into the mt state (m: minus, centered near -60\u00b0) (Hintze et al., 2016) . F132 follows somewhat similar pattern: in the first scenario is adopts m-10 conformation, while in the latter, m-80. These rearrangements are necessary to provide sufficient room for the ligand and proper interactions. Similar transformations in the ligand-binding pocket have been reported for other homologs (Egloff et al., 2006 , Wojdyla et al., 2009 ). In the ADRP/APO1 structure, while the described geometry of the \u03b26-h3-a5 linker remains similar to ADRP/APO2, the entire section and neighboring h1 are shifted away from the binding pocket.",

In that region, three other sequence discrepancies with the MERS-CoV ADRP are located: I23 is replaced by A21 (I24 in SARS-CoV), V49 by I47 (V50), and L160 by V158 (L161).

In these homologs, we observe sequence variation in the F156 position, which is replaced by other hydrophobic residues. The adenine ring is significantly shifted with respect to SARS-CoV-2 ADRP. The interaction between N1 of adenine and D22 equivalent is lost, even though the latter amino acid is conserved in the 3-dimensional context (in IBV, D20 does not overlap in the primary sequence). The distal ribose is better anchored in place -hydrogen bonds link it either to the glutamate residue (E156 in H-CoV-229E, E191 in FIPV) that substitutes L160, or serine in position of V155 (S160 in IBV). Another notable difference is observed in the R2 site, where equivalents of I131 in H-CoV-229E and IBV proteins adopt outlier rotamers, yet the electron density maps allow to model more favorable conformations seen in our structure. In these two models, the proximal ribose adopts a configuration on the anomeric carbon atom (Fig.   6 ). Such a state, with partial occupancy was also reported for one of the SARS-CoV/ADPr complexes (Egloff et al., 2006) and is linked to the alternative, apo-like conformation of G47-G48.",

The X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out at 100 K, at the Structural Biology Center 19-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The diffraction images were recorded on the PILATUS3 X 6M detector. The data set was processed and scaled with the HKL3000 suite (Minor et al., 2006) .",

The ADRP/APO1 structure was determined by molecular replacement (MR) using Molrep (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2010) implemented in the HKL3000 software package and SARS-CoV ADRP structure (PDB id 2ACF) as a search probe. The subsequent structures where solved by MR with a refined SARS-CoV-2 ADRP as a model. In all cases, the initial solution was manually adjusted using COOT (Emsley & Cowtan, 2004) and then iteratively refined using Coot, Phenix (Adams et al., 2010) and Refmac (Murshudov et al., 1997 , Winn et al., 2011 . The final rounds of refinement were carried out in Phenix (ADRP/APO1, ADRP/ADPr, ADRP/MES) or Refmac (ADRP/AMP, ADRP/APO2). ADRP/APO1 and ADRP/ADPr were refined with TLS parameterization of anisotropic displacement parameters while for the remaining structures full anisotropic refinement was calculated. Throughout the refinement, the same 5% of reflections were kept out throughout from the refinement (in both REFMAC and PHENIX refinements). The final models show nearly complete polypeptide chains. The residues that have not been modeled due to the lack of interpretable electron density include: Gly1-Glu2 and Glu170 in chains A and B for ADRP/APO1, Gly1-Glu2-Val3, Leu169-Glu170 in chain A and Gly1-Glu2, Glu170 in chain B for ADRP/ADPr, Gly1-Glu2 in chain A and Gly1-Glu2, Glu170 in chain B for ADRP/AMP, Gly1-Glu2-Val3 and Glu170 for ADRP/MES, and Gly1-Glu2 for ADRP/APO2. The stereochemistry of the structure was checked with MolProbity (Davis et al., 2007) PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and the Ramachandran plot and validated with the PDB validation server. The data collection and processing statistics are given in Table 1 .
