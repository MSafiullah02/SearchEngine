In cells, the 20S proteasome is latent and requires activation for its proteolytic function. At least two classes of proteasome activators have been identified to bind to the 20S core and enhance its catalytic function.24 As illustrated in Figure 1A, the 19S (or PA700) activator attaches to the outer \u03b1-rings of the 20S proteasome to form the 26S (19S-20S) or 30S (19S-20S-19S) proteasome, which is primarily responsible for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins.25,26 The majority of intracellular proteins are degraded via the 26S proteasome after polyubiquitination. Alternatively, proteasome activator 11S (or PA28, REG) binds to 20S core and initiates the proteasomal degradation in an ATP- and ubiquitin-independent manner.27",

This sequestration is followed by fusion with a lysosome and enzymatic digestion of the sequestered materials (Figure 1B). Recent studies have indicated that autophagy not only participates in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, but also plays a crucial role in both innate and adaptive immune responses in response to environmental stress.33,34 In addition, increasing evidence suggests that autophagy, the host defense machinery, can be subverted by some pathogens to facilitate their own replication.8,35 Abnormalities in autophagy have been associated with cancer, infectious, and cardiovascular diseases.36\u201338",

Recent studies have suggested that the viral cardiotropism is due, at least in part, to a preferential accumulation of the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptors on cardiomyocytes.49 Following entry into the cell via these receptors, the positive-strand RNA directs synthesis of a polyprotein via a cap-independent, internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated mechanism.10 This polyprotein is subsequently processed into individual structural (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) and non-structural (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D) proteins following cleavage by viral protease 2A and 3C.10 Viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3D (3Dpol) then synthesizes negative-strand viral RNA intermediate that serves as a template for transcription of multiple progeny genomes (Figure 2A). In addition to polyprotein cleavage, viral proteases are also known to cleave multiple host proteins essential for the maintenance of cellular architecture, protein translation, transcription, and cell signalling.10,50,51",

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that virus can directly injure infected cardiomyocytes, contributing significantly to the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis.10In situ hybridization of viral RNA demonstrates a co-localization of viral genome with the damaged cardiomyocytes.53 Recently, viral proteases are recognized as an important pathogenic mechanism. Cardiac-restricted overexpression of enteroviral protease 2A is sufficient to induce cardiomyopathy, probably through the cleavage of dystrophin, resulting in the detachment of the cardiomyocyte cytoskeleton from the external basement membrane, thereby disrupting myocyte integrity which not only reduces myocyte contractility, but also induces cell death.50,51",

Degradation of these intracellular proteins may represent an evolved strategy that CVB3 utilizes to promote infectivity by attenuating their inhibitory effects on virus replication.

This study suggests that enhanced immunoproteasome expression in cardiomyocytes affects the generation of antigenic peptides and subsequent T lymphocyte-mediated immune responses, contributing to elevated immunopathology and the pathogenesis of myocarditis. Increased production of IFN-\u03b3 during ongoing myocarditis is probably involved in such modulation. IFN-\u03b3 is a key regulatory cytokine for proteasome-mediated MHC antigen presentation. It induces the expression of proteasome activator PA28\u03b1 and \u03b2, as well as the three inducible \u03b2 subunits of the immunoproteasome, leading to increased peptide production for MHC class I presentation.28,29",

The 20S proteasome is latent and present in cells in two forms, constitutive proteasome and immunoproteasome, which differ in the composition of three \u03b2-catalytic subunits. There are at least two classes of proteasome activators. The 19S (PA700) activator binds to the constitutive 20S proteasome to form the 26S (19S\u201320S) or 30S (19S\u201320S\u201319S) proteasome, which is primarily responsible for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. Proteasome activator 11S (PA28) binds to either the constitutive or the immunoproteasome and facilitates ATP- and ubiquitin-independent protein degradation. In addition, 19S can also form a hybrid proteasome (19S\u201320S\u201311S) with 20S proteasome and 11S, which enhances the proteolytic efficiency of antigen processing. For ubiquitin (ub)-dependent proteolysis, substrates are first covalently attached to multiple ubiquitin moieties via the action of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3) in an ATP-dependent manner. (B) The autophagy pathway. A portion of the cytoplasm including organelles is sequestrated by the autophagic isolation membrane, which results in the formation of an autophagosome. The outer membrane of the autophagosome eventually fuses with the lysosome to degrade its contents.",

(B) At the immune response stage, virus infection induces the formation of immunoproteasome to increase MHC class I antigen presentation. Meanwhile, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is enhanced, partially through UPS-mediated NF\u03baB activation. Autophagy may also contribute to immune-mediated pathogenesis by modulating MHC class II antigen presentation. (C) Pathological cardiac remodelling leads to dilated cardiomyopathy. Increased accumulation of abnormal ubiquitin-protein conjugates/aggregates and elevated oxidative stress lead to the eventual impairment of UPS function, subsequently result in abnormal regulation of contractile apparatus expression and also trigger apoptosis and autophagic cell death.
