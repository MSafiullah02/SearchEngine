The use of plasma exchange is independently correlated with survival. The efficacy of plasma exchange depends on the volume of plasma administered to the patient (plasma exchange is able to administer three times more plasma than FFP transfusion alone [11] ). Two pathophysiological mechanisms can explain the efficacy of plasma exchange: plasma exchange removes a`pathogenic' component from the patient's plasma (ULvWF or auto-antibodies) and compensates for the deficient protease (by providing large quantities of plasma). In cases of TTP not associated with an inhibitor, FFP transfusions may be sufficient. When plasma exchange cannot be started immediately (for technical reasons, or while waiting for transfer to a specialized center), large-volume FFP transfusion (20 to 30 ml/kg/day) can be started prior to plasma exchange, but it is associated with a risk of fluid overload, protein-overload proteinuria, hyperproteinemia, and hyperviscosity syndrome. The raised oncotic pressure can also accentuate renal insufficiency.",
