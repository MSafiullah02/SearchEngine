As members of the Orthomyxoviridae family, influenza viruses have an envelope and a negative sense, single-stranded and segmented RNA genome. Of the three groups of influenza virus (A, B and C), type A accounts for all known major epidemics and pandemics. Influenza A virus subtypes are named according to their surface antigens: haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Currently, all sixteen HA (H1 to H16) and nine NA (N1 to N9) serotypes of influenza A virus circulate in the avian population and, consequently, birds are believed to be an important reservoir for influenza A viruses.",

The antigenic shifts that occurred in 1957 and 1968 were a result of avian\u2013human reassortment: in 1957, three of the eight avian gene segments, and in 1968, two avian gene segments were reassorted into existing, human-adapted viruses. This reassortment event is believed by some to occur in animals such as pigs, which can serve as a mixing vessel, as these animals are susceptible to both avian and human influenza virus3. The genetic origin of the 1918 pandemic H1N1 virus, which killed about 50 million people worldwide4 is not known, and there is an ongoing debate as to whether or not the virus 'jumped' directly to the human population or adapted through reassortment1,5,6,7.",

So far, the spread of H5N1 avian influenza virus to the human population has been limited; as of 20 June 2006 there have been around 228 well-documented human cases, but these cases have been associated with a high mortality rate of 130 deaths8, although the rate might be inflated by the lack of reporting of asymptomatic cases.",

            "text": "Several factors are involved in host-range restriction of influenza viruses, but these will not be discussed here, as they have been reviewed recently2. Here, we focus on receptor specificity of influenza virus HA. Influenza viruses use host glycans, which contain sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc)) moieties as cell-surface receptors, which vary in structure from species to species. Human-adapted influenza viruses have HAs with a binding preference for cell receptors that contain \u03b12-6-linked sialic-acid moieties (NeuAc\u03b12-6Gal), which are found predominately on epithelial cells of the human upper respiratory tract, whereas avian viruses prefer receptors with \u03b12-3-linked sialic acid moieties (NeuAc\u03b12-3Gal)9,10,11, which are found on epithelial cells in the intestines and respiratory tract of birds (Fig. 1). This subtle difference in the recognition of glycan structure is a key determinant of the species barrier that prevents avian influenza viruses from easily infecting humans. Another barrier to infection of humans by avian viruses are mucins produced by specialized epithelial cells that lubricate and protect the otherwise exposed upper respiratory tract epithelium. These proteins are rich in \u03b12-3-linked sialosides (sialylated glycans), and function to trap avian influenza viruses and prevent their attachment to epithelial cells12. The inefficient binding of avian viruses to the \u03b12-6-linked sialic-acid moieties on the surface of epithelial cells and their entrapment by mucins provide a barrier to virus infection of the human upper airway.",

Although humans have been infected by the H5N1 avian influenza virus, most documented cases either lived or worked in close proximity to infected poultry and were, therefore, exposed to a sufficiently high viral load that would increase the chances of the virus escaping the protective mucin layer to infect cells in the lower respiratory tract. The restricted replication of H5N1 avian influenza viruses in the lower respiratory tract in humans, where the virus cannot be readily spread by sneezing and coughing11, is believed to account in part for the inefficient human-to-human transmission of H5N1 viruses so far.",

With the identification and isolation of specific \u03b12-3-sialidases and \u03b12-6-sialidases, and advances in technologies for genetic manipulation of the influenza genome, a haemadsorption assay based on desialylation of endogenous sialic acid from RBCs, followed by selective linkage-specific resialylation of RBCs, and subsequent analysis of their binding to viruses or cells transfected with influenza HA, has become routine in many laboratories21,24.",

            "text": "Although such assays potentially reflect the natural binding of a virus to host cell receptors, the outcome is subject to many factors that are often difficult to control. For example, the quality of cell preparations can vary owing to the relative instability of RBCs, and the extensive variability in transfection efficiencies. The activity of the sialyltransferase enzymes might differ substantially between batches and suppliers and lead to varying degrees of enzymatic resialylation, which can skew results and mask any important specificity differences among viral strains. Another factor to consider when using whole-cell assays is the polyvalent cooperative effect of the virus interaction with multiple heterogeneous receptor ligands on the cell surface. Therefore, these assays reflect only the overall 'global' affinity for \u03b12-3- or \u03b12-6-linked sialic-acid receptors and cannot distinguish among the various classes and modifications of sialylated glycans.",

One of the most successful methods reported in recent years uses an assay that is based on competition for binding to solid-phase immobilized virus between a horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated blood sialyl glycoprotein, called fetuin, and unlabelled \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6 sialyloligosaccharides25. The \u03b12-3 and \u03b12-6 sialyloligosaccharides are coupled to polyacrylamide, providing increased valency to compensate for the low HA affinity (mM range) for receptor analogues26,27,28. Such assays have increased our understanding of the diversity of the receptor specificities of influenza viruses from both birds and mammals14,29,30,31,32, including H5 influenza viruses33,34. These assays have been used to evaluate details of influenza virus receptor specificity beyond the standard analysis for recognition of NeuAc\u03b12-3Gal and NeuAc\u03b12-6Gal linkages, demonstrating that influenza virus receptor specificity is more complex than previously recognized.",

Indeed, all of the reconstructed viruses that contain one or more gene segments from the 1918 influenza virus were generated and handled under BSL-3 enhanced (BSL-3+) laboratory conditions36, in accordance with the guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and the CDC35. Any study that analyses potential humanization of the current H5 HPAI strains by mutagenesis of the viral genome would require extreme care and a minimum of BSL-3 facilities (Table 1).",

With the commercial availability of anti-His-tag antibodies, the HA can be pre-complexed with fluorescent primary and/or secondary antibodies (Fig. 3). Because the affinity of HA for its glycan ligand is low (mM range)26, the use of such complexes has proved highly advantageous as the secondary antibodies provide increased valency to obtain detectable signals.

Striking differences in the receptor specificity of the different HAs were revealed not only for the type of glycan sialic-acid linkage, that is, either an \u03b12-3 and/or an \u03b12-6 sialic-acid linkage, but also in the fine specificity of HAs for other glycan modifications, such as fucosylation, sulphation and additional sialylation63,65 (Fig. 4). For example, a single amino-acid difference between the two variants of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus was sufficient to switch the HA from a classic human \u03b12-6-linked sialoside-binding pattern (Asp225), as seen with the A/South Carolina/1/1918 (SC) HA, to mixed specificity with a significant reduction in binding to \u03b12-6-linked sialosides and an increased affinity for \u03b12-3-linked sialosides, particularly for glycans with an additional negative charge, such as a sulphate or sialic acid (Fig. 4a,b) for the A/New York/1/1918 (NY) strain HA (Gly225)65. From these results, it was proposed that the extra cavity arising from Gly225 in the 1918 NY strain HA might allow more flexibility in its glycan binding. This would enable N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to adopt an orientation within the HA receptor-binding site, that would allow Lys222, which is maintained in nearly all HAs from avian and human H1, H2 and H5 serotypes, to interact preferentially with the 6-sulphated moieties. Although the biological significance of binding to sialylated and sulphated glycans is not clear at present, human mucins have been shown to contain 6-sulphated glycans, demonstrating that the necessary enzymes are present in the human epithelium and, therefore, that sialylated sulphated structures might be of importance in virus\u2013host interactions33,66.",

Comparison between these two avian subtypes shows the power of the array in differentiating HA binding to glycan ligands that contain additional fucose linkages to GlcNAc. Ligands 25\u201329 on the array are all fucosylated glycans and it is clear that the human H3 HA does not bind to such ligands (Fig. 4f), whereas the H5 HA does bind them, albeit weakly (Fig. 4d). The use of such analyses allows the ready identification of a receptor footprint for each virus. Therefore, it is clear that, although human and avian virus HAs have a primary specificity for either \u03b12-6- or \u03b12-3-linked sialosides, each virus might use a different range of glycan receptors for cell entry, and the ability of a virus to infect a host cell might depend on features in the glycan structure, other than simply the type of sialic-acid linkage.",

Like mammalian cells, insect cells can assemble, transfer and trim N-glycans to produce high mannose or paucimannose products67. But insect cells differ from mammalian cells in that they are unable to process these glycan products any further to produce complex glycans that contain terminal galactose and/or sialic acids. However, the presence of influenza NA, a sialidase, ensures that complex glycans of influenza HAs usually terminate only in galactose and, therefore, the size of the N-glycans that are elaborated by insect cells approximate the size of the complex N-glycans in mammalian host cells. Indeed, our studies using insect-cell-produced HAs, and cell-based assays with whole viruses show that glycans produced in both systems can affect receptor binding through steric hindrance if the N-glycan is positioned close enough to the receptor-binding site of the HA65,68. In addition, results for both avian H3 (A/duck/Ukraine/1/1963) and H1 (A/Duck/Alberta/35/1976) HAs63,65 were in agreement with previous whole-viral studies21,23.",

For example, different mutations known to switch the receptor specificity of pandemic H1, H2 and H3 viruses from an avian to a human preference were introduced into the H5N1 viral isolate, Viet04, one of the most pathogenic viruses studied so far69,70. In pandemic H1, H2 and H3 viruses, two different combinations of two mutations effectively switched receptor specificity from \u03b12-6 to \u03b12-3-linked glycans and vice-versa. Although no clear switch in receptor specificity was observed for the H5 HA, the mutations that switched the specificity of H3 viruses from avian to human (at residues 226 and 228) not only reduced overall avian specificity for the H5 HA, but also increased specificity/avidity towards biantennary sialosides63, which might function as receptors on human lung epithelial cells. These combined effects could allow an H5N1 virus to escape entrapment by mucins and increase binding to susceptible lung epithelial cells and so might provide a possible route by which H5N1 viruses could become established in the human population. Current studies are ongoing to determine whether mutations of any other residues around the HA binding pocket can cause a more obvious switch in specificity. Therefore, incorporation of mutations in and around the receptor-binding site into the recombinant HA can assess the effects on binding specificity without the need to generate potentially dangerous mutant viruses.",

            "text": "By working together, future development of DNA and glycan microarray technologies could enable rapid assessment of emerging viruses to detect virus subtypes and receptor specificities that increase the risk to the human population, and to eliminate guesswork from sequence analyses alone. A recent and exciting development is an agreement between the CDC and the CFG that will provide a customized influenza glycan microarray to allow the CDC to assess its usefulness for screening influenza field isolates. Although such technological developments still require improvement in both their accuracy and sensitivity of detection, in the future, portable machines might be used to conduct such tests in the field, adding a new dimension to characterizing and assessing avian influenza outbreaks. Such knowledge could aid decisions for deployment of emergency services to contain a potential outbreak.",

The haemagglutinin (HA) of human influenza A viruses has a binding preference for cell receptors that contain \u03b12-6-linked sialic-acid moieties, whereas avian viruses bind preferentially to \u03b12-3-linked sialic acids moieties. The respiratory epithelial cells of pigs have receptors that express both \u03b12-3- and \u03b12-6-linked sialic-acid moieties, and can be infected by both human and avian viruses. The resulting viral progeny will either be intact avian or human virus, which can only infect their respective hosts or, if reassortment yields functional virus (usually swapped HA, PB2 and/or neuraminidase (NA)), a new pandemic strain might emerge with the ability to retain efficient human-to-human transfer, but be sufficiently different (for example, by a species change in HA) to reduce the ability of the host to mount an effective immune response.

Approximately 200 different glycans are bound to a glass slide, and the binding of recombinant HA proteins to the different glycans is detected by fluorescent antibodies that bind to a His tag on the recombinant HA. Preliminary experiments65 used His-tagged recombinant HA pre-complexed to a mouse fluorescent anti-penta-His antibody (six HA-binding sites per complex), but this failed to detect binding to the array owing to the weak HA affinity (mM range) for receptor analogues26. Binding to a secondary fluorescent anti-mouse-IgG1 antibody (resulting in twelve HA-binding sites per complex) allowed the detection of fluorescence. It was concluded that the additional multivalency enabled detection through avidity effects, comparable to the natural interaction of HA trimers on the viral envelope with the host cell. The intensity of the fluorescent signal determines whether the binding is recorded as strong, weak or absent. The HA produced by this method can also be used for crystallization and structural studies. Whole-virus analysis involves glycan microarray analysis with intact virus.
