Contaminated textiles are sorted and ordinary waste from infectious waste. Used syringes and other stabbing/cutting waste, glass, etc. are collected as hazardous waste. Used wheelchairs and other major patient aids are usually washed here. The bedpan, urine bottles, etc. are disinfected in the decontaminator. The room has a large load of dirt and microbial agents where the personnel may perform many space-demanding tasks. A large and efficient area with good separation between clean and unclean work tasks, good ventilation and negative pressure ventilation and good methods for cleaning and disinfection are necessary. The following chapter is focused on areal and outfit of the disinfection room to avoid transmittance of infections between patients, personal and environment.",
