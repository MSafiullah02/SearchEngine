This paper investigates the use of a novel bio-kernel function for the kernel self-organizing map. For verification, the application of the proposed new kernel self-organizing map to HIV drug resistance classification using mutation patterns in protease sequences is presented. The original self-organizing map together with the distributed encoding method was compared. It has been found that the use of the kernel self-organizing map with the novel bio-kernel function leads to better classification and faster convergence rate\u2026",

Both amino acids and nucleic acids are non-numerical attributes. In order to analyze molecular sequences, these non-numerical attributes must be converted to numerical attributes through a feature extraction process for using a machine learning algorithm. The distributed encoding method [2] was proposed in 1988 for extracting features for molecular sequences. The principle is to find orthogonal binary vectors to represent amino (nucleic) acids. With this method, amino acid Alanine is represented by 0000000000 0000000001 while Cystine 0000000000 0000000010, etc. With the introduction of this feature extraction method, the application of machine learning algorithms to bioinformatics has been very successful. For instance, this method has been applied to the prediction of protease cleavage sites [3] , signal peptide cleavage sites [4] , linkage sites in glycoproteins [5] , enzyme active sites [6] , phosphorylation sites [7] and water active sites [8] .",

It has been used for the prediction of membrane protein types [12] , the prediction of protein structural classes [13] , subcellular location prediction [14] and the prediction of secondary structures [15] . However, the method ignores the coupling effects among the neighbouring residues in sequences leading to potential bias in modelling. Therefore, di-peptides method was proposed where the frequency of each pair of amino acids occurred as neighbouring residues is counted and is regarded as a feature. Dipeptides, gapped (up to two gaps) transitions and the occurrence of some motifs as additive numerical attributes were used for the prediction of subcellular locations [16] and gene identification [17] . Descriptors were also used, for instance, to predict multi-class protein folds [18] , to classify proteins [19] and to recognise rRNA-, RNA-, and DNA-binding proteins [20] , [21] . Taking into account the high order interaction among the residues, multi-peptides can also be used. It can be seen that there are 400 di-peptides, 8,000 tri-peptides and 16,000 tetra-peptides. Such a feature space can be therefore computational impractical for modelling.",

Kernel methods were firstly used in cluster analysis for K-means algorithms [33] , where the Euclidean distance between an input vector x and a mean vector m is minimized in a feature space spanned by kernels. In the kernel feature space, both x and m were the expansion on the training data. Fyfe and his colleagues developed so-called kernel self-organizing maps [34] , [35] . This paper aims to introduce a bio-kernel function for kernel SOM. The method is verified on HIV drug resistance classification. A stochastic learning process is used with a regularization term.",

In computer aided drug design, it is desired to study how the genomic information is related with therapy effect [46] . To predict if HIV drug may fail in therapy using the information contained in viral protease sequences is regarded as genotype-phenotype correlation. In order to discover such relationship, many researchers have done a lot of work in this area. For instance, the original selforganizing map was used on two types of data, i.e., structural information and sequence information [46] . In using sequence information, frequency features were used as the inputs to SOM. The prediction accuracy was between 68% and 85%. Instead of neural networks, statistical methods and decision trees were also used [47] , [48] , [49] .",

The original SOM was also used for comparison. Both SOMs used the same structure (36 output neurons) and the same learning parameters, i.e. the initial learning rate ( 01 . 0 = h \u03b7 ). Both algorithms were terminated when the mean square error was less than 0.001 or 1000 learning iterations. Fig. 1 shows the error curves for two SOMs. It can be seen that the bio-kernel SOM (bkSOM) converged much faster with very small errors. 2 shows a map of bkSOM, where \"n.a.\" means that there is no patterns mapped onto the corresponding output neuron, \"5:5\" means that all the five patterns mapped onto the corresponding neuron are corresponding to the mutation patterns which are resistant to the drug and \"0:9\" means that all the nine patterns mapped onto the corresponding neuron are corresponding to the mutation patterns which are not resistant to the drug. Table 1 shows the comparison in terms of the classification accuracy, where \"NR\" means non-resistance and \"R\" resistance. It can be seen that bkSOM performed better than SOM in terms of classification accuracy. The non-resistance prediction power indicates the likelihood that a predicted non-resistance pattern is a true non-resistance pattern. The resistance prediction power therefore indicates the likelihood that a predicted resistance pattern is a true non-resistance pattern. For instance, the nonresistance prediction power using SOM is 90%. It means that for every 100 predicted non-resistance patterns, 10 would be actually resistance patterns. ",
