Improvements in hygiene and decreased microbial exposure in childhood have been hypothesized to be responsible for the increased occurrence of allergies, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory bowel disease in the westernized world (Strachan, 1989). On the other hand, conditions such as environmental enteropathy and decreased oral vaccine efficacy are seen in the developing world. Environmental enteropathy is a diffuse villous atrophy of the small bowel, which is ubiquitous in children in the developing world (Campbell et al., 2003, Menzies et al., 1999). It has been observed that environmental enteropathy reverses on transfer to an environment with improved hygiene and sanitation (Lindenbaum, 1968, Lindenbaum et al., 1971). Clearly, the environment is an important factor in the development of human disease.",

Significant effort has been made to understand the bacterial component of the human stool microbiome and the role it may play in human disease. For example, a dysbiosis or shift in the relative abundances of the bacterial taxa has been associated with obesity (Turnbaugh et al., 2009), inflammatory bowel disease (Frank et al., 2007, Sartor, 2008), diabetes (Larsen et al., 2010), and necrotizing enterocolitis (Mai et al., 2011). The bacterial microbiome can be influenced by several factors including diet, geography, and phage populations. Studies comparing the bacterial gut communities from healthy populations in different parts of the world show that the bacterial microbiome varies with geography (De Filippo et al., 2010, Yatsunenko et al., 2012).",

In monkeys, pathogenic infection with simian immunodeficiency virus is associated with expansion of the enteric virome, including both RNA viruses and DNA viruses (Handley et al., 2012). A limited number of studies have begun to define the eukaryotic stool viromes of people with diarrhea (Finkbeiner et al., 2008, Nakamura et al., 2009, Phan et al., 2012, Smits et al., 2014, van Leeuwen et al., 2010), non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (Victoria et al., 2009), and healthy adults (Zhang et al., 2006). However, a limitation of the previous human studies is that none have explicitly compared eukaryotic viromes between geographic sites, disease states or age groups, and thus it is not known what factors might influence the composition of the human virome.",

            "text": "Since all of the stool samples sequenced were from children with acute diarrhea, it was anticipated that a known diarrhea virus would be detected in many of the samples. Twenty-four (28%) of the 87 samples contained sequences derived from the families Reoviridae, Caliciviridae, Adenoviridae or Astroviridae. Strikingly, sequences from many additional virus families were detected in these samples as well as in samples that did not contain sequences from the four canonical diarrheagenic virus families. The most commonly detected virus family was the Anelloviridae, which was present in 37 samples. In total, viral sequences were identified in 57 (66%) of the 87 Australian samples while 35/87 (40%) of the samples had sequences from 2 or more viral families (Supplementary Table 1). Thirty-five of the 44 (80%) samples from the Northern Territory had one or more viral families detected which was more than the 22 of the 43 (51%) samples from Melbourne that had virus detected. One sample from Northern Territory contained sequences from 8 different viral families (\nFig. 1a). Overall, sequences from 22 different viral families were detected in these 87 samples. These included viruses from families known to reside in the gastrointestinal tract such as Picornaviridae (Pallansch and Roos, 2007), Anelloviridae (Okamoto et al., 1998), Circoviridae (Li et al., 2010), and Orthomyxoviridae (Wootton et al., 2006) and known plant viruses, including members of the families Betaflexiviridae, Bromoviridae, Endornaviridae, and Virgaviridae, consistent with previous studies that reported detection of plant viruses (Finkbeiner et al., 2008, Victoria et al., 2009, Zhang et al., 2006). In addition, viruses not previously thought to have an enteric reservoir were detected. For example, human parainfluenza 3 was detected in one sample. The most common viral families detected were Anelloviridae (37 samples), Picornaviridae (26 samples) and Adenoviridae (10 samples). As with all sequencing based studies, our findings are limited by the depth of sequencing achieved. It is possible that deeper sequencing may detect additional viruses present at low abundance.",

However, a number of technical challenges and limitations precluded this form of analysis. First, highly variable coverage levels of the viruses ranging from a single read to hundreds of reads of a virus were obtained, presumably due to variations in viral load as well as the relative abundance of the virus compared to other non-viral nucleic acid molecules in the sample. For samples with low coverage levels, it is impossible to determine whether multiple reads that align to different regions of the same reference virus are derived from the same or related but distinct viruses; therefore, it is challenging to accurately define the number of virus species present. Furthermore estimation of the viral load or copy number from the number of reads obtained is complicated by the sequence independent PCR step, which may introduce amplification biases.",

Diarrhea samples from the Northern Territory contained more viral families per sample than diarrhea from Melbourne (p=0.0002 (Wilcoxon)). This was also true at the genus level (p=0.0003 (Wilcoxon)). To control for differences for the larger number of unique reads generated in the Northern Territory samples compared to the Melbourne samples (Table 1), we randomly selected unique reads from the Northern Territory samples to achieve the same sampling depth of the Melbourne samples 100 times. All 100 iterations showed that samples from the Northern Territory contained more viral families (and viral genera) per sample than the samples from Melbourne (p<0.05 (Wilcoxon)). This result demonstrates that the significant difference between Northern Territory and Melbourne is not due to the higher number of unique reads obtained for Northern Territory samples. To determine if a particular viral family drove this difference we compared the prevalence of each individual virus family in the two cohorts. The highly abundant anelloviruses were detected with similar frequencies in the two cohorts (Northern Territory, 52.3%, Melbourne, 32.6%; (p=0.083 (Fisher\u05f3s exact))). Two families, the Picornaviridae (p=0.0003 (Fisher\u05f3s exact)) and the Adenoviridae (p=0.015 (Fisher\u05f3s exact)) were statistically different between the two locations. As there are many picornaviruses known to infect humans, we then determined which picornavirus genera were present. Sequences from the following genera in the family Picornaviridae were detected: Cardiovirus, Enterovirus, Klassevirus, Kobuvirus, and Parechovirus (\nTable 2). The genus Enterovirus was the most frequently detected and was the only one that was statistically different between the two locations (p<0.001 (Fisher\u05f3s exact)).",

Furthermore, these observations suggest the possibility that viruses are present in the human gut in a fashion analogous to the well-established bacterial microbiome. Longitudinal studies are needed to shed further light on the nature of the eukaryotic virome.",

It is plausible that environmental factors such as diet, living conditions, water quality, hygiene and/or socioeconomic status could dictate the composition of the stool virome. The samples from Melbourne mainly represent patients living in a westernized and urban setting, while the samples from the Northern Territory represent patients largely from remote communities scattered across a large area. Health indicators among children in the Northern Territory, including for a range of infectious diseases, are worse than for children elsewhere in Australia (Gracey and King, 2009, Ruben and Walker, 1995). The paucity of enteroviruses in the Seattle cohort and their comparative abundance in children from The Gambia is consistent with the model that these viruses are associated with children living in impoverished conditions. Culture-based studies from several decades ago of healthy children also demonstrated a greater frequency of excretion of enteroviruses among persons of lower socioeconomic status (Honig et al., 1956, Otatume and Addy, 1975). Additionally, a recent study in Seattle showed no enterovirus detection in stools from children with diarrhea (Braun et al., 2012).",

The 42% adenovirus prevalence in The Gambia is similar to previously described reports from some other locations (France and Kenya) (Berciaud et al., 2012, Magwalivha et al., 2010). Unlike the situation with enteroviruses, adenoviruses were detected in approximately equal frequencies in Northern Territory and Seattle.

Briefly, sequences were deconvoluted based on their barcode (Supplemental Table 2). To reduce the risk of cross contamination between samples barcodes were required to be present at both ends of the read with a perfect match and was trimmed before any further analysis. To reduce the number of near identical sequences introduced from PCR bias, sequences were clustered using CD-HIT (Li and Godzik, 2006) requiring 95% identity over 95% of the sequence. The longest sequence from each cluster was chosen as the representative unique sequence. Sequences were then masked by RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org). If a sequence did not contain a stretch of at least 50 consecutive non-\u201cN\u201d nucleotides or if greater than 40% of the total length of the sequence was masked, it was removed from further analysis. The remaining high quality unique sequences were then sequentially compared to (1) human genome using BLASTn, (2) nt database by BLASTn and (3) nr database using BLASTx. Minimum E-value cutoffs of 1\u00d710\u221210 for BLASTn and 1\u00d710\u22125 for BLASTx were used. Sequences were then binned based on the top BLAST hit to human, mouse, fungal, bacterial, phage, viral, and other. Sequences aligning to both a virus and another kingdom with the same E-value were classified as ambiguous and not subjected to further analysis. Viral sequences were binned into families based on the taxonomical identity of the best BLAST hit as defined by the NCBI Taxonomy database. Results from this approach have been previously compared directly to other similar BLAST-based taxonomic classifiers such as MEGAN (Handley et al., 2012). Samples were considered positive for a family (or genus) if at least one unique read was present. From previous experience with stool virome analysis, alignments to particular viral families in the NCBI Taxonomy database (herpesviridae, iridoviridae, mimiviridae, phycodnaviridae, poxviridae, unclassified dsDNA viruses, and environmental samples) have a high frequency of false positives, usually due to low complexity and/or repetitive sequence motifs yielding artefactual alignments. Thus, all sequences aligning to these families were manually evaluated and those deemed to be false positives were removed from further analysis.",
