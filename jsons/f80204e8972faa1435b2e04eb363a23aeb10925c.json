These sites harbor the CoV replication-transcription complexes (RTCs): multi-protein complexes consisting of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), the CoV nucleocapsid protein (N) and presumably host proteins. To successfully establish functional membrane-bound RTCs all of the viral and host constituents need to be correctly spatiotemporally organized during viral infection. Few studies, however, have investigated the dynamic processes involved in the formation and functioning of the (subunits of) CoV RTCs and the replicative structures in living cells. In this chapter we describe several protocols to perform time-lapse imaging of CoV-infected cells and to study the kinetics of (subunits of) the CoV replicative structures. The approaches described are not limited to CoV-infected cells; they can also be applied to other virus-infected or non-infected cells.",

These \"replication organelles\" have been studied in lots of detail over the last few decades, generating a wealth of exciting information with respect to their composition, morphology, and functioning during the viral life cycle. Unfortunately one of the most, and perhaps unintentionally, overlooked areas is the real-time spatiotemporal dynamic behavior of the formation and functioning of the replicative structures themselves but also the individual (membranous) associated components in living cells.",

            "text": "To study the dynamic processes underlying the formation and functioning of the CoV replicative structures and/or replicationassociated proteins, one needs noninvasive means to visualize them in living cells. Recombinant CoVs expressing replicase proteins fused to fluorescent proteins (FPs) serve as an excellent tool to perform such real-time imaging studies in their native environment. Alternatively, these fluorescent fusion proteins may be expressed upon transfection of expression plasmids prior to infection, if desirable in combination with plasmids expressing host proteins fused to FPs. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) several live-cell imaging techniques can be employed to investigate the real-time kinetics of the replicative structures and its associated components. Once cells are infected with the recombinant FP-expressing CoVs, one can simply follow the fate of the replicative structures or its components over time, either under native or perturbed conditions, resulting in valuable spatiotemporal information with respect to the formation and behavior of the replicative structures and its associated components (see Fig. 1 for an example of a time-lapse experiment of MHV-nsp2GFP-infected LR7 cells). Alternatively, a (part of the) pool of FPs may be selectively and irreversibly photobleached and the temporal fate of the remaining non-bleached proteins may be followed [reviewed in [17] [18] [19] ]. From the latter measurements parameters can be extracted, which among others reflect (the lack of) mobility [21] ] and at 6 h p.i. a time-lapse experiment was performed as described in Subheadings 3.1 and 3.2. Nsp2-GFP-positive foci were manually tracked over time using MtrackJ [22] and examples of the displacement of these structures have been indicated by the different numbered and colored lines [fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)] or the (dis) continuity between different membrane compartments [fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP)]. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the principles of the FRAP and FLIP approaches, respectively, with typical fluorescence intensity graphs that can be obtained from these type of live-cell imaging experiments depicted in Fig. 4 .",

Fig. 2 Schematic overview of a FRAP experiment. A specific region of interest (ROI) targeting (part of) the FP-tagged replicative structure(s) is irreversibly photobleached and the recovery of fluorescence into the bleached area is monitored over time. In this example, the FP-tagged proteins are mobile as recovery of the fluorescence in the bleached area is observed [as has been previously observed for the MHV N protein [14] ]. In the absence of recovery, the FP-tagged proteins are immobile [as has been observed for example for the MHV nsp2 protein [21] ]. The green structures in the cell are a schematic representation of the replicative structures. BG background ROI for qualitative FRAP analysis Fig. 3 Schematic overview of a FLIP experiment. The replicative structure(s) is repeatedly photobleached in ROI1 (circle) and the loss of fluorescence is monitored in ROI2 (squared box) or ROI3 (circle) over time. In this example the fluorescence of the FP-tagged structure is lost over time in ROI2, but not ROI3, indicating continuity between the membrane compartments of ROI1 and ROI2, but not between those of ROI1 and ROI3. Another cell in the field of view may be used to monitor/correct for photobleaching during the FLIP assay Although, the live-cell imaging protocols described in this chapter uses CoV-infected cells, these approaches can easily be applied to other virus-infected or non-infected cells. The decrease of fluorescence (diamonds/blue line) indicates that continuity between membrane compartments exists. If no or hardly any decrease is observed, the different membrane compartments are not continuous (for example ROI3 in Fig. 3 ). The squares/red line represents the loss of fluorescence of a control cell that is not photobleached and serves as a control that the observed loss of fluorescence is due to migration of FP-tagged proteins into the bleached area and not due to general photobleaching of the cell itself",
