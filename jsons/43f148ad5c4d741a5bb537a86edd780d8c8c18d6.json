Concerning China, in February 13, it seems that China changed the way they counted the number of contaminated people and then an artificial jump appears in the evolution. To correct this error, we multiply the previous values by a factor M = 1.255 in order to smooth the transition. In table 1, we show the results obtained for the different countries. For comparison purposes, in the case of China we use 2 intervals [t min , t max ] to adjust the parameters. We observe that in all cases, the values of the exponential grow a in the case of no-isolation measure is quite similar and, as expected, the residual exponential grow b is much smaller. In Fig. 1, 2, 3 we compare the expected evolution accordingly with the model and the actual data. In the case of China, using a large interval of times to estimate the parameters the expected evolution is not far from the actual one all along the times. Using a shorter period of times at the beginning of the full period (to check the ability of the method to forecast future evolutions), we observe that the final number of patients is larger than the actual one, but still reasonable. In the case of Italy and Spain the results are quite reasonable and the model provides a forecast of the evolution. In spite of we can expect (as in China) a significant error in the final estimation, we think that it could be good enough to help to understand how the expected evolution could works. ",
