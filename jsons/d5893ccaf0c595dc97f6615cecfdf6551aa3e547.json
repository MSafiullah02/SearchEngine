Lip is white, three-lobed, and quite variable in shape and size. C. davidii usually flowers in June and July (Chen et al. 2009a) . C. davidii is distributed from India across southern China to Taiwan and southern Japan, occurring in forests at 1200-2000 m. However, the last time it was collected in India was in July 1899 (Rathore 1983) . It is probably seriously endangered or extinct in the Himalayas. Perner (2007) found it growing and flowering in between Cypripedium wardii at 1620 m in pine forest in Sichuan in late May. Plants were most luxuriant at the grass borders. Herbal Usage: Herb (Mayaqi) refers to both C. alpina and C. davidii although the vegetative appearance of the two species is dissimilar. They are generally supplied by the same provinces, Hebei, Shanxi, Hunan, Hubei Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan. Guangxi also supplies C. alipina but does not produce C. davidii. Stems and roots of C. davidii are used in the same manner and for the same conditions as those of C. alpina in Chinese Herbal Medicine (Wu 1994; Zhongyao Bencao 2000) .",

Calanthe reduces stasis of blood, improves blood circulation and detoxifies. A number of species (C. alismaefolia, C. davidii, C. gracilifolia, C. fimbriata, C. lamellose and C. puberula) are said to be antipyretic. Several Calanthe are used for treating wounds and infected skin (C. alismaefolia, C. densiflora, C. discolor, C. manii, C. mascula, C. puberula and C. similes) (Wu 1994; Lin et al. 2003) . Among the ways of using the orchid, wine fortified by the roots of some Calanthe species was reportedly usedused in China to treat traumatic injuries and internal bleeding (Hu and Cheo, quoted by Perry and Metzger 1980) .

Half a tablespoon is administered on an empty stomach twice a day for one week to treat hyperacidity and stomach upsets. This is the practice of the Dongria Kandha hill tribe in the southwest of Orissa State in India (Dash et al. 2008) .",

When the light intensity is low, for instance during winter, the orchid may switch to strong dependency on fungi for its carbon nutrition (Preiss et al. 2010 ). C. falcata photosynthesises but simultaneously obtains carbon supplies from mycorrhiza (Thelephraceae fungi growing on oak), i.e. it is mixotrophic (Yagame and Yamato 2013) . C. longifolia obtains 33 % of its carbon and 86 % of its nitrogen from Thelephraceae fungi (Abadie et al. 2006) . Tripartate symbiosis should be considered when attempts are being made to conserve terrestrial orchids growing in deep shade or in temperate regions. or April and fruit is set in May to June. There is considerable variation within the species, allegedly an adaptive mechanism for pollination (Sun et al. 2005) . Bumblebees of the species Bombus trifaciatus Smithi pollinate the orchid. Visits by other species of insects have also been observed in Shenggongjia, but their visits do not result in pollination (Sun et al. 2003) .",

This is a handsome, steady epiphyte growing on trees in broad-leaved evergreen forests at 700-2000 m in Yunnan, Guizhou, Hainan, Indochina and Thailand Herbal Usage: Herb is obtained from Hainan and Yunnan. The whole plant is used as a remedy for heat and toxins, sore throat and tonsillitis in China (Wu 1994) . Leaves are used to treat diabetes in Thailand (Chuakul 2002 (Vaddhanaphuti 2005) . In Sri Lanka, it is sometimes found in association with three other orchid species, namely Bulbophyllum thwaitesii Rchb. f., Cymbidium aloifolium (L.)

As this is the only species of Cleisostoma that occurs on the Malabar Coast; the drawing of a Cleisostoma without flowers and labeled as Kolli Tsjerou Mava-maravara or Abotia in van Rheede's Hortus Indicus Malabaricus (1703) may be identified as C. tenuifolium (van Rheede 1703). Herbal Usage: The whole plant was used in western peninsular India to treat kidney disorders, leucorrhoea, gonorrhoea and scalds (van Rheede 1703). Made into a poultice, Kolli Tsjerou Mavamaravara was used to reduce pain and swelling of abscesses and to promote their rupture. Plant was also blended in vinegar and administered to expel kidney stones, treat dysuria, gonorrhoea, other forms of white vaginal discharge and heavy menstrual loss (Van Rheede 1703).",

Five Cleisostoma species were screened for alkaloids and none were found to have at least 0.1 % alkaloid content which was designated as the diagnostic criterion for classification as an alkaloid-accumulating species. However, several non-medicinal species (C. appendiculata, C. discolor, C. racemiferum, C. subulatum) contained small amount (0.01-0.1 % dry weight) of alkaloid (Luning 1974a, b) . The genus Coelogyne is constituted by more than 200 epiphytic species, of which about 80 are in cultivation. They are distributed from northern India and southern China across Southeast Asia to the Pacific, in lowland and montane forests. Introduced by John Lindley in 1822, the name is derived from Greek, koilos (hollow) and gyne (female), possibly referring to the deep stigmatic cavity. Many species bear pendulous inflorescences with flowers that open simultaneously resulting in spectacular displays, but in some species single flowers open in succession on a short inflorescence. Flowers of most species short-lived, usually lasting less than a week. Pseudobulbs are prominent and carry one or two plicate leaves which do not sheath the pseudobulb ( Fig. 9.19 ).",

Flowers are white, large and fragrant, sepals and petals with undulating borders that fold backwards in parts ( Fig. 9 .21). Flowering period is February and March in India, May in China. Distributed throughout Nepal, Bhutan and northern India at 1000-2000 m (Manandhar and Manandhar 2002) , Bangladesh and Myanmar, it is found on large rocks in southern Tibet at 1700-1800 m (Chen and Clayton 2009). Phytochemistry: Ethanolic extract of C. cristata is strongly bacteriostatic against Staphylococcus aureus and moderately against Escherichia coli (Marasini and Joshi 2012), a property which supports its usage in animal husbandry. Coelogin and coeloginin, and two novel 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene derivatives, coeloginanthridin and coeloginanthrin, were isolated from air-dried, finely-ground whole plant of C. cristata by Majumder's group (Majumder et al. 1982a (Majumder et al. , 2001 . The four compounds possess the biological activities of phytoalexins and endogenous plant growth regulators. Sensitivity testing of soil and other bacteria to individual phytoalexins should be performed to determine which compounds, if any, could be reasonable remedies for superficial infections, but such data are not available.",

            "text": "Phytochemistry: 5,7-dihydroxy-3-(3-hydroxy-4-methioxybenzyl)-6-methoxychroman-4-one is the homoisoflavanone isolated from the pseudo bulbs of C. appendiculata by Shim et al. (2004) of Korea (Fig. 9.32 ). It inhibits basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced, in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis of the chorioallantoic membrane of the chick embryo, without demonstrating any toxicity. It also inhibits inflammatory and allergic response in mast cells, and ultraviolet beaminduced skin inflammation (Hur and Kim 2009a, b) by reducing cyclooxidagenase-2-expression and NF-kappa B nuclear localisation (Hur et al. 2010) . C. appediculata extract up-regulates tyrosinase activity in vitro (Yan et al. 2002) . Tyrosine is the enzyme that promotes melanin formation, darkening of skin and UV protection. Xue et al. (2005) from the Institute of Materia Medica in Beijing's Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences isolated and identified six compounds from the \"corm\" of C. appendiculata: isohircinol, flavanthrinin, p-hydroxyphenylethyl alcohol, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyl alcohol, daucosterol and beta-sitosterol. A few months later, they reported the isolation of eight compounds from the \"tubers\" (pseudobulbs) of C. appendiculata: cirrhopetalanthrin, 7-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl-1-0-beta-D-glucoside, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methoxy phenyl-1-0-beta-glucopyranoside, tyrosol 8-0-beta-D-glucopyranoside, vanilloloside, p-hydroxybenzyl aldehyde, sucrose and adeniosine ( Fig. 9.33 ). Except for cirrhopetalanthrin which showed non-selective moderate cytotoxicity, none of the other compounds showed any cytotoxicity against human colon cancer (HCT-8), human hepatoma (Bel77402), human stomach cancer (BGC-823), human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), human breast cancer (MCF-7) and human ovarian cancer (A2780) cell lines (Xia et al. 2005) . Next, employing ethanol as a solvent, they recovered six new phenanthrene derivatives from the pseudobulbs of the orchid which consisted of three monophenanthrenes, two biphenanthrenes and one triphenanthrene. The compounds were screened for possible cytotoxicity but they tested negative (Xue et al. 2006) . They also managed to isolate two new terpenoids, cadinane sesquiterpene and ent-kaurane diterpene diglycoside, together with a known triterpene with 32 carbon atoms. The triterpene with 32 carbon showed selective cytotoxicity against human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) in vitro but not against other human cancer cell lines, while the two terpenoids tested negative throughout (Li et al. 2008) . A new pyrrolizidine alkaloid, cremastrine, was isolated from the pseudobulbs by Ikeda et al. (2005) at Mitsubishi Pharma Corporation in Osaka ( Fig. 9.34 ). Seven compounds isolated with silica gel, reverse-phase silica gel, and Sephadex column chromatography were identified by Liu et al. (2008) as 5-methoxybibenzyl-3,3'-di-Obeta-D-glucopyranoside, militarine, loroglossin, protocatechuic acid, succinic acid, gastrodin and daucosterol. Compound 1 is new and the others were isolated from C. appendiculata for the first time. At least one of these compounds has a neuroprotective effect, but the effect of extracts of C. appendiculata on the nervous system has not been fully studied. Subsequently, another 14 compounds were isolated from petroleum ether and ethyl acetate extracts of Shancigu, namely: 4,4 0 -dimethoxy-9,9 0 , 10,10-0 -tetrahydro-(1,1 0 -biphenanthrene)2,2 0 , 7,7 0 -tetrol; 4,4 0 , 7,7 0 -tetrahydroxy-2,2 0 dimethoxy-1,1 0 -biphenanthrene; 3,5-dihydroxy-2,4-dimethoxyphenanthrene; physcion; chrysophanol; emodin; genkwanin; quercetin; quercetin3 0 -O-beta-Dglucopyranoside;",

            "text": "Neovascularisation (an overgrowth of new blood vessels) in the eye is the commonest cause of blindness. It occurs in premature retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and sickle cell anaemia. Jeong Hun Kim and his colleagues found that, in a rat model, the compound, a homoisoflavanone, extracted from C. appendiculata significantly reduces retinal neovascularisation. The scientists proposed that the compound might be useful for the treatment of vaso-proliferative retinopathies (Kim, Kim, Kim et al. 2007; Kim et al. 2008) . A synthetic isomer of this homoisoflvanone code-named SH-11052 exhibits antiproliferative activity against human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human retinal microvascular endothelial cells. Although it did not induce apoptosis, it might be able to complement existing antiangiogenic drugs usedused in the treatment of neovascular eye diseases (Basavarajappa et al. 2014 ). An ethanol extract of Dendrobium chrysotoxum was also found to be capable of alleviating retinal angiogenesis in Homoisoflavonoids exhibit a broad range of bioactivities that include antimicrobial, antimutagenic, anti-oxidant, immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, cytotoxic, anti-angiogenesis, vasorelaxant, anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects (Lin, Liu, Ye 2014; Lee et al. 2014a, b; Basavarajappa et al. 2015) . Therefore, there is still much about C. appendiculata that could be explored. Perhaps homoisoflavanone would also find a use in the treatment of tumours. There is a single case report of a 74-year-old patient with metastatic bladder cancer who refused chemotherapy and was treated with oral and nebuliser Korean herbal therapy which included C. appendiculata tubers. Serial X-rays showed diminution of the multiple metastatic nodules in the lungs and his symptoms disappeared. The herbal remedy is complex and, besides C. appendiculata, it contained Cordyceps militaris, Panax ginseng radix, Commiphora myrrha, Calculus bovis, margarita, Boswellia carteri, Panax notoginseng radix; the nebuliser solution was made with wild ginseng and Cordyceps sinensis distillate (Lee, Kim, Seong, et al. 2014) . The Korean team is also studying other compounds from herbs with similar properties, for instance decursin extracted from roots of the non-orchidaceous plant, Angelica gigas Nakai (Kim, Kim, Lee, et al. 2009 ).",

Description: C. acuminatum is a variable, robust, terrestrial herb. Stem is succulent, 10 cm tall without inflorescence (Abraham and Vatsala 1981) ; shoot with inflorescence is 16-27 cm tall (Joseph 1982), with round pseudobulbs, and 1-4 unequal, ovate sessile leaves, 3-14 by 1.3-4 cm. Inflorescence is 10-25 cm long, with pale, yellow to green, or pink to dull purple flowers ( Fig. 9.36 ). In India, it flowers from July to September depending on location (Abraham and Vatsala 1981; Joseph 1982; Matthew 1995) . The preceding description fits the Indian variety. In Thailand, leaves are lanceolate-elliptic, thin, plicate, 5-9 by 2-3 cm, 4-6 leaves per plant. Thai flowers are 1 cm across (Nankorn and Watthana 2008). The orchid is also found at Gaoligongshan in western Yunnan where it blooms from May to July (Jin et al. 2009).",

In Ayurvedic classification, it is sweet in taste (as a matter of fact, it is slightly bitter), cold in potency, pacifies vata and aggravates kapha. It is cooling, thus causing fever to abate, and promotes sperm formation. It is administered to men whose wives are unable to conceive. Pseudobulbs are used to treat bleeding disorders, fever, tuberculosis and a sensation of heat, emaciation, dysentery, rheumatism and insect bites (Pushpa et al. 2001) . Sometimes, they are substituted with Pueraria tuberosa (Singh and Duggal 2009 ). Pseudobulbs of Crepdium acuminatum (syn. Microstylis wallichi) were considered to be simultaneously a tonic and an aphrodisiac (Duggal 1971) .

Cymbidium is distributed in tropical East Asia from India eastwards to China, Japan and Southeast Asia in lowland and montane forests. Its hybrids play an important role in the cut flower industry but they are not grown extensively in Southeast Asia because the large, showy types require cool temperatures to initiate flowering. Approximately 68 species have been described, with 49 occurring in China. The generic name is derived from Greek kymbos (boat-shaped cup), alluding to the lip of the flower.",

It has been reported as very common on Borassus flabellifer L. in northern Sri Lanka, but also occurs on many host plants which include Albizzia falcata, Wormia triquetra, Artocarpus nobilis, Artocarpus heterophyllus, Cassia nodosa, Samanea saman, Eugenia sp., Garcinia sp., Mangifera indica and Terminalia arjuna (Jayaweera 1981). In Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia, it is epiphytic on palms ( Fig. 9.38 ). Santapau and Kapadia (1966) highlighted the confusion between this species and C. pendulum and with C. bicolor. C. aloifolium is sometimes confused with C. paucifolium in China, but the latter is distinguishable by its shorter, broader leaves and few flowers (usually 6-11), and also with C. mannii, but in the latter the leaves are thinner and the two lamellae of the lip are not broken in the middle (Liu et al. 2006) . There is also confusion between this species and C. finlaysonianum Lindl., a common lowland orchid in Malaysia and Indonesia (Du Puy and Cribb 2007) . The latter has pendulous scapes which commonly reach 90-100 cm in length with widely spaced flowers. Phytochemistry: C. aloifolium contains several phenanthrenes: aloifol I and II, coelonin and 6-methoxycoelonin (Juneja et al. 1987 ), cymbinodin A (Barua et al. 1990 ), cymbinodin B (Ghosh et al. 1992 ), a novel polyoxygenated phenanthrene derivative designated pendulin, and a 3,7-dihydroxy-2,4,8-trimethoxyphenanthrene named denthyrsinin, the last which had earlier been isolated from Eulophia nuda and Dendrobium thyrsiflorum (Majumder and Sen 1991 ). An ethanolic extract of C. aloifolium leaves produced an anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect in mice (Howlader et al. 2011) . It would be good to know which of any of the six phenanthrenes isolated so far have antiinfammatory, analgesic or haemostatic effects.",

Unfortunately, the publication did not permit specific identification of the species because the orchid name might refer to any of the following: C. pendulum Herbal Usage: In Indian traditional medicine, juice is extracted from the whole plant by pounding it with ginger and a small amount of water is usedused to induce vomiting and diarrhoea (Caius 1936) , or to cure chronic illness, weakness of the eyes, vertigo and paralysis (Lawler 1984) . Reddy et al. (2005) who researched the region of the Eastern Ghats found that aboriginal Konda reddis of East Godavari district used the aerial roots of the orchid to make a paste for treating cracks on the feet, whereas aboriginal Koyas of Khammam district usedused a similar preparation for setting fractures. On the other side of the Deccan in the Uttara Kannada district, roots of C. aloifolium are added to tubers of a common terrestrial orchid, Zeuxine strataeumatica, to prepare a tonic (Rao 2004) . Tribal residents at Kudremukh National Park in Karnataka use the mucilage extracted from the orchid leaves to stop bleeding from leech bites, as the sap is said to promote blood coagulation. Powdered pseudobulb is made into a drink to cause vomiting and purging by the same tribes (Rao 2007) . C. aloifolium also forms an ingredient of medicinal oil that is usedused to treat both benign and malignant tumours. To treat paralysis, the Dongria Kandha tribe in Southwestern Orissa uses a twice-daily dose of a mixture of cow's milk with powdered root of the orchid, ginger and black pepper for a period of 2 months (Dash et al. 2008 ). Santapau and Kapadia (1966) reported that the leaf sap had styptic properties. This useful medicinal property caused the plant to be collected to such an extent that it disappeared from some areas. Crushed leaves are used to stop bleeding from leech bites (Rao and Sridhar 2007) . It is sometimes used as a vegetable aphrodisiac or as salep in India (Puri 1970b, c) . Valaiyans living in the Vellimalai Hills of Tamil Nadu heat the leaves over a fire and administer the hot juice into the ear to relieve earache (Ganesan and Kesaavan 2003) .",

The entire plant is used to reinforce the body fluids, nourish blood (yin), 'smooth the lungs', reduce phlegm and stop coughing. It also stops pain, especially dysmenorrhoea, and corrects amenorrhoea, leucorrhoea (vaginal discharge), giddiness, coughing and haemoptysis in tuberculosis. It helps to heal burns. It is diuretic. Flowers brighten the eyes if consumed over a long period, and relieve coughs, chest pain, glaucoma and cataract. Decoction of the root was formerly used in China to treat gonorrhoea (Zhongyao Da Cidian 1986; Wu 1994) . To treat bronchitis, it is recommended that two leaves be boiled and the decoction consumed. For chronic coughs, juice is extracted from 30 g of fresh root and mixed with rock sugar for a dose of medicinal syrup. For leucorrhoea, 30-60 g of fresh root is cooked with lean pork and served as a soup. The plant is freshly mashed up to prepare a poultice for application to boils and abscesses (Li 1994) . A decoction made with the roots and rhizome of C. ensifolium was mixed with rice wine (fermented glutinous rice) and eaten as a remedy for stomach ache (Hu 1971) . Regular consumption of a tea made with C. ensifolium is a method usedused to correct stagnation of qi. The orchid is also usedused for the induction of labour (Zhonghua Bencao 2000) Examples of Fujian and",

Sepals and petals are narrow and pointed. Lip is cream, striped with red on the side lobes, and splashed with a border of red on the mid-lobe. It grows in shady, moist, well-drained soil in forests and along ravines at 300-2000 m. Its distribution extends from India to Myanmar, northern Thailand, Vietnam and east China to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. In China, it has a long flowering period that extends from October to March (Chen et al. 1999) or to May (Chen, Liu, Chu, et al. 2009 ) with a peak around Chinese New Year, but in Thailand the chartreuse-coloured variety flowers in August (Vaddhanaphuti 2001 ) and the dark purplishbrown variety flowers from October to December (Nanakorn and Watthana 2008) .",

It was mentioned in the Book of Odes (collated in the sixth century BC) under its ancient Chinese name \"Wild Grass\". Confucius likened the character of gentlemen to the nature of Cymbidium-simple in its needs, modest, discreet, Spartan, resilient, reclusive and disdainful of honours, noble. When Kubulai Khan conquered China and instituted the most horrendous genocide, Zhen Xuxiao (1250-1300) expressed his grief by painting uprooted C. goeringii. This painting is now in the National Palace Museum in Taipei, but there are similar paintings in the collection of the Osaka Municipal Museum. It is one of the four seasonal flowers, and represents spring (Teoh 1982) . Although many writers make the mistake of linking C. ensifolium with spring, that species flowers from June to October. Chun Lan (Spring Orchid) is the Chinese name for C. goeringii.",

In the course of time, new varieties have appeared, possessing variegated leaves, multiple flowers and various colour forms, such as narrow central purple streaks along the dorsal sepal and petals, or an orange-coloured flower (the variety Takahime or Martial Princess in Japan). Every one of the popular cultivated species (C. goeringii, C. ensifolium, C. kanran, C. faberi, C. tortisepalum, C. sinense, C. serratum, C. cyperifolium, C. hookerianum, C. floribundum) have produced mutations and there are several books in the Chinese language dedicated to describing such mutations.

Classified into four coloured groups, pink, yellow, green and white, their pigmentation is strongest in the lip, and even white forms carry a trace of pigment there. Six anthocyanins were isolated from 8 Cymbidium hybrids of four colours by Wang et al. 2014 working in New Zealand. The anthocyanins are: cyanidin-3-O-glucoside; cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside; peonidin-3-O-glucoside; peonidin-3-O-rutinoside; cyaniding-3-O (malonyl)-glucoside; and peonidin-3-O (malonyl)-glucoside. Anthocyanin, which is responsible for the lip coloration, is also present in high concentration in the tepals of pink flowers, but only trace to small amounts occur in flowers of other hues. Chlorophyll and its green breakdown products, pheophytin a and b responsible for the colour of green flowers, are also present in small amounts in yellow flowers. Yellow flowers carry beta-carotenoid and some additionally contain lutein. Three flavonols, glucosides of kaempferol, quercetin and isohamnetin, are present in all flowers. They are co-pigments that determine the final colour in association with anthocyanins (Wang et al. 2014) .",

The 50 % effective concentration of the Cymbidium hybrid agglutinin (CA) and Epipactus helliborine agglutinin for HIV ranged from 0.04 to 0.08 mcg/ml, which is about 3 orders of magnitude below their toxic threshold (Balzarini et al. 1992) .

However, they would need to be tested on laboratory animals and later on human volunteers before they can be medicine.",

Scientists at Utrecht University in the Netherlands usedused three antiviral tests based on different evaluation principles to study the plant lectins: (1) cell viability (MTT-based colorimetric assay); (2) the number of infected cells (immunoperoxidase assay); and (3) the amount of viral protein expression (luciferase-based assay). These findings are important because there are no antivirals to combat infection with the Nidovirales (the Order grouping which includes the toroviruses, arteriviruses, roniviruses and coronaviruses). A coronavirus was the cause of the sudden SARS outbreak that caused numerous deaths and brought havoc to the Far East in 2002-2003. In their review, World Health Organization (WHO) experts on SARS from the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) concluded that, after they had examined 54 SARS treatment studies, \"it was not possible to determine whether treatments benefited patients during the SARS outbreak. Some may have been harmful\" (Stockman et al. 2006) . Finding an effective antiviral agent is important. Can Cymbidium lectins provide an answer?",

Cypripedium guttatum enjoys the greatest distribution among Cypripediums being present in eastern Europe, northern Asia through Japan and North America. It is a small herb which is distributed throughout northern China (except Xinjiang) and southwest China except Guizhou, in forests, scrub and marshes at 1000-4100 m (Yang, Zhang, Feng, et al. 1993) . It can be found in both open and shady habitats over a wide geographical range because of a greater efficiency in photochemical utilisation of absorbed light energy and a lower non-photochemical dissipation of excess light energy, but does best with 45 % sunlight (Zhang, Hu, Xu, et al. 2007 Herbal Usage: Herb is collected from Shanxi, Gansu, Hubei and from China's southwest (Wu 1994) . Roots are used to improve qi and blood circulation, reduce swelling and pain, \"cold in the stomach\", pain around the waist and thighs and pain resulting from injury.

Prescriptions for its use are mentioned in Shaanxi Chinese Herbs (Table 9 .6). Description: Plant is 25-50 cm tall, carrying alternate elliptic or elliptic-ovate, plicate, pubescent leaves, 15 by 6-8 cm, and a terminal inflorescence with a single flower. The 8-cm-broad, deeply pouched, well-rounded lip reminiscent of the ideal Song porcelain shape is surrounded by the striped, dorsal sepals and petals which curl around it. Holger Perner (2007) found populations of exclusively white forms near Vladivostok. Elsewhere, the colour of the flowers varies from a light pink to deep red or purple. It flowers in June and July ( Fig. 9 .55). Natural hybrids with C. calceolus are common; the resultant natural hybrid, Cypripedium \u00c2 ventricosum has been described by many authors and so far bestowed with 14 different names. In Japan, the paler forms are known as var. speciosum (Rolfe) Koidzumi, of which the white form is known as var. speciosum (Rolfe) Koidzumi f. albiflorum (Makino) Ohwi. The yellow form, var. rebuense (Kudo) Miyabe et Kudo, occurs only in Rebun Island northeast of Hokkaido.",

There are three types of tertian malaria, each caused by a different parasite. Benign tertian malaria produces bouts of high fever with chills and rigours occurring every other day, and is caused by Plasmodium vivax. As its name denotes, it only weakens the patient and results in anaemia but is not fatal. Numerous antimalarial drugs like quinine, chloroquine and doxycycline work well for benign tertian malaria. Malignant tertian malaria is quite a different matter. The causative parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, does not provoke a high fever response but is capable of infecting the brain, and when it does the disease is often fatal (Hunter 1956 ). Common antimalarial drugs do not work on falciparum malaria but the parasite is killed by artemesinin, which is derived from an ancient Chinese herbal remedy for malaria, Artemesia annua. Thus, it would be important to know which type of malaria responds to C. japonicum, but that information is not available.",

Its persistent, stout 1-2 cm diameter, horizontal rhizome occurs 0.5 m below the soil surface and possesses a perennial root system, which reaches upwards to a depth of 5-15 cm below the surface. Each of the 20 main roots is about 1 m long when they are young but eventually they may reach up to 5 m. They produce short secondary roots, many of which establish permanent symbiotic relationships with mycorrhiza, Armillaria mellea (Honey Mushroom) or Armillaria tabescens, on which the orchid is dependent for its carbon supply (Rasmussen 1995) . Inflorescence is up to 90 cm tall with peach-coloured flowers that carry a yellow lip (Fig. 9.58 ). Flowers appear in late spring and summer (May to July). Fruit is banana red. The aerial portion of the orchid is also achlorophyllous.",

Germination occurs in sawdust-based medium containing one of four fungal species, Armillaria gallica, Armillaria mellea, subsp. Nipponica, Armillaria tabescens and Xylobolus annosus; germination even occurred in the absence of direct seed-mycobiont contact (Umata et al. 2012) .
