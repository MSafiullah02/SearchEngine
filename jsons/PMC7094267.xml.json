            "text": "Several longitudinal studies of the natural history of asthma in childhood have shown that the disease starts during the first year of life in at least 30 percent of pediatric patients, in over 50 percent before 2 years of age, and in about 80 percent by the time they reach school age.9 There is no evidence that early onset of the disease is associated with an unfavorable prognosis.9,10 The general severity of asthma plays, however, an important role in the eventual outcome. When asthmatic children are followed up until young adulthood, it appears that most improve as they get older.1,7,10,11 Patients who are mildly affected in early childhood have a better than 50 percent chance to go into long-term remission (>three years) between 14 and 21 years of age; the likelihood of getting worse is less than 5 percent. The remaining youngsters who started out with mild asthma will continue to have intermittent problems. When the disease is severe at 14, the chances of going into a long-term remission are poor (<5 percent); nevertheless, approximately half of these patients will improve as they get older, but they will remain active asthmatic patients, and a few will even get worse. In a prospective study of 3317-year-olds with wheezing before the age of 7 years, two thirds were still symptomatic at 21.11 Others have observed a more favorable prognosis,12 but it is quite clear that the optimistic notion that \u201cmost children outgrow their asthma\u201d is not true. Table 2\nsummarizes the general trends which can be expected in childhood asthma. Carefully analyzed, prospective surveys have demonstrated that childhood asthma is associated with a high incidence of hay fever, eczema, positive skin tests, and elevated IgE levels, the highest incidence occurring in the most severely affected youngsters.6,13\n",

Five to 50 percent of infants who have bronchiolitis during the first few months of life develop asthma;14 the fraction approximates 40 to 50 percent in those who have indications of or a family history of atopy.15,16 In a recently published study, 75 percent of infants with bronchiolitis developed wheezing during a 2-year follow-up, and 60 percent had hyperinflation on pulmonary function tests.17 It has also been shown that children with recurrent croup have heightened upper and lower airway reactivity, indicating that they are at risk to develop asthma.18\n",

When there is mild airway obstruction, approximately 40 percent of the patients demonstrate mildly increased airway responsiveness, and when the FEV1 is less than 40 percent of predicted values, over 80 percent of patients show excessive airway sensitivity to inhaled bronchoconstrictors.

Johnstone et al20 noted that infants who underwent such surgical procedures had a 5 to 10 times greater chance of developing asthma and a 2.5 times greater chance of getting allergic rhinitis than control subjects. The incidence for either respiratory problem to develop was 36 percent following pyloric stenosis repair and 55 percent following herniorrhaphy, compared to 10.6 percent in infants who did not have either surgery. The reason for this high incidence of asthma following abdominal surgery in infancy is not clear; however, when we consider that these babies were intubated, just as those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, I wonder whether upper airway injury secondary to intubation was the common precursor which caused the respiratory tract to become hyperreactive.",

Early, repeated and intense exposures to airborne antigens increase the risk of airway sensitization. Some allergens are more asthmagenic than others, and animal danders, molds, and house dust appear particularly likely to sensitize the airways. While food allergies can produce gastrointestinal and dermatologic problems in children, they rarely cause asthma. When food is implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma, it usually produces problems during the first year, and asthma is then often associated with eczema. Asthma is very rare in the children of primitive tribes of Western Africa.21 It has been postulated that this is due to the endemic presence of intestinal parasitic infections causing high levels of IgE, thus preventing these people from developing IgE antibodies to airborne allergens. When they move to urban environments, and when their intestinal infestations are brought under control, the incidence of asthma becomes that of the nonindigenous population. There is no consistent evidence that socioeconomic environments influence the development of reactive airway diseases,5 although once asthma is present, crowded living conditions favor the spread of viral respiratory tract diseases which, in turn, are major triggers of acute reversible airway obstruction. There are no indications that emotional maladjustments cause asthma, although they may act as triggers. Exposure to smoke can activate latent airway disease,22 and there is a dose-dependent relation between parental smoking and wheezing in children.23\n",

Tartrazine yellow, a widely used coloring agent, may bring on bronchospasm in some patients who also have an idiosyncrasy to aspirin. Recently, metabisulfites have been implicated in producing acute bronchospasm in sensitive individuals.26 While this latter idiosyncrasy has not been described in children as yet, it is likely that there are some who are sensitive to this common food preservative.

There can be suprasternal and intercostal retractions, use of accessory respiratory muscles, and cyanosis. The reversibility of signs and symptoms, even with optimal therapy, can be slow in status asthmaticus, particularly in infants. In small children, this is primarily due to the small size of their peripheral and central airways, and the plugging which results from small amounts of secretion, edema, bronchospasm, and necrotic epithelial debris. The differential diagnosis in the young child between bronchiolitis and asthma is difficult, if not impossible, even when a respiratory syncytial virus infection has been documented. Whenever clinical bronchiolitis recurs, it is likely that the infant has asthma. I do not like to commit myself to the diagnosis of asthma during the first attack of wheezing; however, when an infant or young child wheezes and coughs with most viral respiratory tract infections, the diagnosis is probably asthma.

When there is doubt about the existence of reactive airway disease, bronchial challenge tests may also be indicated. For the older child (>6 to 7 years), the tests are basically the same as those performed in adults. For the preschool child, modifications of standard tests have been developed. They include partial flow-volume curves, body plethysmographic evaluations of the functional residual capacity and airway resistance, and measurements of respiratory system resistance by forced oscillation. In the office and the clinic, peak flow meters are very useful, and good results can often be obtained in 4- and 5-year-olds. Performing the pulmonary function tests in the young child require some cooperation; therefore, training is recommended, and experienced, friendly, motivated technologists are needed to obtain optimal results. We should also remember that arterial blood gas measurements are important measures of ventilation/perfusion relationships and thus of lung function. Assessments of lung functions before and after bronchodilator administration are extremely valuable for initial and follow-up evaluations, since they are the best means of assessing objectively and in quantitative terms the severity, reversibility, and progression of airway obstruction.

They include the development of pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and subcutaneous emphysema. Atelectasis is very frequent in preschool children, is usually subsegmental, but may involve a whole lobe, especially the right middle lobe. Atelectasis is so frequent because the young child's airways are small and easily plugged by secretion and epithelial debris, and collateral ventilation is poorly developed. Atelectasis is often mistaken for pneumonia on the chest x-ray film. Chest deformities indicate the presence of long-standing, poorly controlled small airway obstruction and hyperinflation. When the chronic airway obstruction is reversed, it usually takes several months or even years before chest deformities are corrected. Growth delays are common in children with severe and often steroid-dependent asthma. While the growth velocity may be delayed, the vast majority of asthmatic children eventually reach normal height and weight. Only when large doses of steroids are used for extended periods of time (>5 mg/m2/day) will growth be permanently altered.39 Long-term use of steroids poses a risk of posterior capsular cataracts, especially in children who show retardation of bone age.41 Behavioral and school problems develop occasionally in children with severe asthma.42 Frequent hospitalizations, school absenteeism, interruptions of normal childhood activities, and interference with normal relationships among peers are the probable causes of these maladjustments. A few patients with severe asthma develop allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. This diagnosis should be considered in any child who has severe asthma, recurrent pulmonary infiltrates, marked skin test positivity to Aspergillus fumigatus antigen, elevated IgE (>1,000 units/L), eosinophilia, sputum containing brown or pinkish plugs, and sputum from which A fumigatus has been cultured.",

In addition to pharmacologic therapy, patient and family education is important,43,44 and very occasionally psychotherapy may be needed.42 Both parent's and sometimes siblings, babysitters, and close relatives benefit from participating in asthma education programs. All persons involved in the care of children with asthma need to learn about the chronic nature of this illness. Their cooperation is mandatory if a successful outcome is to be achieved. We also invite teachers, coaches, interested friends, and parent's of preschool children with asthma to our Family Asthma Programs.43 Parents, as well as the pediatric patient should be taught, in ageappropriate terms, the pathophysiologic mechanisms which are responsible for airway obstruction, and the reasons why certain drugs have to be taken. They have to learn the names and side effects of the medications, the warning signs and triggers of asthma, and the role that the patient, his family, friends, and other caretakers play in self-management. Lifestyle changes, such as cessation of smoking by parent's or siblings, discontinuation of the use of wood-burning stoves,22 getting rid of household pets, and adjustments in participation in household chores and selected recreational activities, such as horseback riding, may be required. It is to be hoped that the needed changes can be made without causing resentment. Our Family Asthma Program has been effective in increasing participation of the children in various activities, lessening school absenteeism, reducing emergency room and physician office visits, and improving coping with the disease.44 We also believe that a Family Asthma Program will increase compliance with prescribed treatment programs, and it usually enables parent's and children to develop healthier and more realistic attitudes toward this chronic disease.",

            "text": "In the drug therapy of asthma, we rely primarily on the supervised and frequently reviewed use of theophylline, \u03b22-adrenergic agonists (especially by the inhaled route), and cromolyn sodium. Treatment should achieve normalization of lung function without causing undesirable side effects. Whether this goal has been reached and is sustained is best evaluated by periodic reviews of the health status, pulmonary function tests, and measurements of theophylline blood levels when indicated. Theophylline blood levels should be assessed whenever there are signs of toxicity or failure of a good response at reasonable doses. For the management of acute bronchospasm, we use repeated inhalations of \u03b22-adrenergic agonists or injected terbutaline. Both forms of therapy can be given at home by appropriately trained caretakers. I favor injected terbutaline over epinephrine because of less tachycardia, pallor, and excitement and more prolonged bronchodilation following terbutaline injections. When there are frequent recurrences of bronchospastic attacks, when a chronic cough is believed to be due to reactive airway disease, or when a child's small airway obstruction does not resolve, long-term therapy with inhaled and oral bronchodilators or cromolyn should be considered. The availability of aqueous cromolyn and bronchodilators and moderately priced compressor-activated nebulizers has made the administration of these drugs possible in very young children. Inhalation chambers and spacers have also helped with the administration of metered-dose aerosols in school-aged children and teenagers who find it difficult to coordinate inhalation and activation of the metered-dose cartridges. parent's must be advised that long-term treatment may be required for years. We should replace episodic with anticipatory care, and acknowledge that asthma is a chronic disease which requires a comprehensive and often long-term therapeutic approach.",

While we must retain a healthy respect for corticosteroids, we should not commit an asthmatic child to invalidism just because we do not want to use oral prednisone or inhaled beclomethasone or triamcinolone. The skilled and cautious use of these agents will often result in complete normalization of lung function and a return to normal life. Inhaled steroids should be used whenever possible to minimize systemic side effects. We hope that aqueous forms of topical steroids will be available soon, so that we may administer them by compressoroperated nebulizers to infants and small children. There is no evidence at this time that effective, long-term control of asthma will influence the natural history of its outcome;10 however, anticipatory care can improve the quality of life for these patients significantly.",

After 12 to 14 years of age, doses usually have to be reduced also. Tremors, hyperactivity, headaches, nausea, vomiting, and even seizures and hematemesis are encountered in children, but seizures are a relatively late and rare complication. Children may start bedwetting when starting theophylline therapy, and behavioral changes and school problems are not infrequent. Poor attention spans, restlessness, and poor writing skills are occasionally noted by parent's and teachers. The complications of theophylline toxicity can be very serious. Whenever there are concerns about theophylline toxicity, blood levels must be obtained. Even when blood levels are within the therapeutic range, drug doses must be reduced whenever undesirable side effects have developed. With the availability of long-acting, slow-release preparations, suicides have been attempted, especially by teenaged girls. Overdoses and toxicity must be treated aggressively, including gastric lavage, gastric administration of charcoal, and charcoal hemoperfusion. Mild theophylline toxicity can be precipitated without a change in theophylline dosing by the simultaneous use of cimetidine, erythromycin, and other antibiotics in the macrolide group. Changes in diet during acute and viral infections may alter the rate at which theophylline is broken down, and alterations in airway reactivity have been observed following influenza vaccination.45,46 The combination of oral \u03b22-adrenergic agents and theophylline may potentiate toxicity from either drug. For this reason, inhalation therapy with bronchodilators is favored, since inhaled bronchodilators elicit fewer systemic side effects than orally administered agents. It is possible that some of the remaining mortality in asthmatic children is due to drug toxicity rather than respiratory failure and its associated complications.",
