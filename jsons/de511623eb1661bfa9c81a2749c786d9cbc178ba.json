Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, broadspectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of the general population from emerging and re-emerging viral diseases, reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we review discovery and development of BSAAs and summarize the information on 120 safe-in-man agents in a freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/). Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand the spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections.",

Antiviral drugs and vaccines are used to fight viral infections in human (De Clercq and Li, 2016; Marston et al., 2014) . Previously, there has been a focus on \"one drug, one virus\" dogma, which relied on targeting virusspecific factors. A counterpoint to this is the \"one drug, multiple viruses\" paradigm, which came with the discovery of broadspectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs), small-molecules that inhibit a wide range of human viruses (Bekerman and Einav, 2015; de Clercq and Montgomery, 1983; Debing et al., 2015; Ianevski et al., 2019; Rada and Dragun, 1977; Sidwell et al., 1972) . This paradigm was based on the observation that different viruses utilize similar pathways and host factors to replicate inside a cell (Bosl et al., 2019) . Although the concept of BSAAs has been around for almost 50 years, the field received a new impetus with recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, Dengue, influenza and other viral infections, the discovery of novel host-directed agents, as well as development of drug repositioning methodology.",

This has significant advantages over new drug discovery since chemical synthesis steps, manufacturing processes, reliable safety, and pharmacokinetic properties in pre-clinical (animal model) and early clinical developmental phases (phase 0, I and IIa) are already available (Figure 1) . Therefore, repositioning of launched or even failed drugs to viral diseases provides unique translational opportunities, including a substantially higher probability of success to market as compared with developing new virus-specific drugs and vaccines, and a significantly reduced cost and timeline to clinical availability Pizzorno et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2018) .",

Immortalized cancerous cell cultures and co-cultures, which express appropriate viral receptors, are most commonly used in this first step. The halfmaximal cytotoxic concentrations (CC 50 ) for a compound are calculated based on their dose-response curves obtained on mockinfected cells. The half-maximal effective concentrations (EC 50 ) are calculated based on the analysis of curves obtained on infected cells. Statistical analyses can help to determine if the differences between CC 50 and EC 50 are significant, given the inherent variability of the experiment (Meneghini and Hamasaki, 1967) . A relative effectiveness of a drug is defined as selectivity index (SI = CC 50 /EC 50 ).",

            "text": "Cell viability assays and cell death assays are commonly used to assess the cytotoxicity and efficacy of BSAAs ( Figure 2A ). Cell viability assays include MTT, MTS, resazurin or similar assays, mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent dyes-based assays, esterase cleaved dye-based assays, ATP-ADP assays, and assays that measure glycolytic flux and oxygen consumption. Other cell death assays include LDH enzyme leakage assays, membrane impermeable dye-based assays, and apoptosis assays, such as Annexin V, TUNEL, and caspase assays (Shen et al., 2019) . For example, the Cell Titer Glo (CTG) assay quantifies ATP, an indicator of metabolically active living cells, whereas Cell Tox Green assay uses fluorescent asymmetric cyanine dye that stains the DNA of dead cells (Bosl et al., 2019; Bulanova et al., 2017; Ianevski et al., 2018; Muller et al., 2014) . Viral strains or cell lines expressing reporter proteins are also used to assess the efficacy of BSAAs in infected cells. For example, TZM-bl cells expressing firefly luciferase under control of HIV-1 LTR promoter allowed quantitation of BSAA action on HIV-1 infection (tat-protein expression by integrated HIV-1 provirus) using firefly luciferase assay (Sarzotti-Kelsoe et al., 2014; Xing et al., 2016) . RFP-expressing RVFV, nanoLuc-expressing CHIKV and RRV, as well as GFP-expressing FLUAV, HCV and HMPV also allowed identification of novel activities of several BSAAs (Andersen et al., 2019b; Bosl et al., 2019; de Graaf et al., 2007; Habjan et al., 2008; Ianevski et al., 2018; Jupille et al., 2011; Kittel et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2017; Utt et al., 2016) . In addition, qPCR/RT-qPCR, RNA/DNA sequencing, RNA/DNA hybridization, immuno-and plaque assays as well as CRISPR-Cas9 systems could be used for detection of inhibitory effects of BSAAs (Boonham et al., 2014; Fischer et al., 2017; Konig et al., 2019; Laamiri et al., 2018; Landry, 1990; Perez et al., 2013; Sashital, 2018; Zhou et al., 2018) . Interestingly, CRISPR-Cas9, siRNA and shRNA approaches were used for identification of BSAA targets (Deans et al., 2016; Puschnik et al., 2017) .",

However, these genetically modified systems have certain limitations (attenuated or incomplete virus replication cycle, accumulation of mutations during repeated cell and virus passaging, defective innate immune responses and viral counter-responses, etc.) (Carter and Shieh, 2015) . Thereby, novel antiviral activities of BSAAs should be further validated in primary human cells using different viral strains (including wild-type viruses), different viral loads, different times of compound addition, different endpoint measurements and compound concentration range. Primary cell cultures give more accurate images of drug responses (Alves et al., 2018; Denisova et al., 2012; Koban et al., 2018; Postnikova et al., 2018) . They have a low population doubling level and therefore more closely recapitulate the physiological conditions observed in vivo.",

The cells are characterized by their high degrees of specialization, are often fully differentiated and thus require defined culture conditions (serum-free media) in order to preserve their original phenotype. Peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC), placental, amniotic and fetal primary cultures as well as vaginal/cervical epithelial and male germ cells have been used intensively to validate BSAA activity (Barrows et al., 2016; Denisova et al., 2012; Fink et al., 2018; Rausch et al., 2017; Robinson et al., 2018) . Although primary cell cultures are relevant systems for validation of BSAAs, there are technical difficulties limiting their use, such as ethical issues, purity of population of primary cells, and limited shelf life of the cells. In addition, age, race, sex and other genetic and epigenetic factors of donor cells should be considered to determine common biological effect across a significant number of donors thereby avoiding minor variants (Lee et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2013) .",

Therefore, several in vivo models have been developed to test novel antiviral activities of BSAAs. These include immunocompetent and genetically or chemically immunocompromised mice, guinea pigs, hamsters, ferrets, pigs, macaques and other animals ( Figure 2B ) (Alves et al., 2018; Haese et al., 2016; Louz et al., 2013; Morrison and Diamond, 2017; Taylor, 2017; Thangavel and Bouvier, 2014) . PK/PD studies determine drug absorption, dosage and half-life of BSAAs. Toxicological studies determine if the drugs have any adverse effects on the tissues and organs of the animals and define the dosage of adverse effects (Alabaster and In Vivo Pharmacology Training Group, 2002; Parasuraman, 2011; Rizk et al., 2017) . Studying the efficacy of BSAAs is generally done by treating the animal with the drug or vehicle and infecting it with a virus of interest. Endpoints are usually body weight/ mortality (depending on the virus), histopathology, virus titers in organs, presence of clinical signs and development of immunity (Oh and Hurt, 2016; Smee and Barnard, 2013) . Although animal models can give the initial characterization of BSAA, it is important to keep in mind that they differ significantly from humans, with respect to symptoms, disease manifestation, susceptibility, immune responses, pathogenesis, and pharmacokinetics (Barr\u00e9-Sinoussi and Montagutelli, 2015; Shanks et al., 2009) .",

Thus, safe-in-man BSAAs enter phase II and III, which assess the efficacy, effectiveness, safety and side effects of the drugs in clinic.

The BSAAs inhibit viral or host factors and block viral replication, reduce the viral burden to a level at which host immune responses can deal with it or facilitate apoptosis of infected cells (Table S1 ). Analysis of BSAA targets and structures (Figure 4 ) revealed that the most abundant are nucleotide and nucleoside analogues which inhibit viral RNA and DNA polymerases. Imatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, and dasatinib, which inhibit tyrosine kinases, are the most abundant hostdirected BSAAs. Most of the host targets (except Bcl-xL protein) are essential for viral replication but redundant for the cell, which is critical for reducing putative toxicities associated with blocking cellular pathways. The limited diversity of the targets and scaffolds could slow down the development of BSAA concept. Emerging BSAAs, such as 5,6-dimethoxyindan-1-one, saliphenylhalamide, and GS-5734 (Denisova et al., 2012; Kuivanen et al., 2017; Muller et al., 2011; Muller et al., 2014; Patil et al., 2017; Sheahan et al., 2017) , whose safety profiles in humans are not yet available, are not included in the database.
