In developed countries, the systematic prescription of antimicrobial drugs to patients with CAP has led to a dramatic reduction in mortality linked to this pathology [2], [3]. However, a bacterial origin of CAP has not been documented in a large proportion of cases despite extensive aetiological investigations. The current recommendations [4], [5], [6] encourage pediatricians to prescribe a probabilistic antimicrobial treatment, even when no bacterial infection is documented, which results in prolonged use of antibiotics and in the possible selection of resistant strains within the endogenous flora [7].",

At this time, most of the epidemiological data from pediatric CAP relied on traditional bacteriological cultures. With the occurrence of new diagnostic tools and notably of multiplex PCR assays able to simultaneously detect a large panel of viruses and atypical bacteria, it now appears that a large proportion of CAP could be related to viral infection [10], [11], [12]. Many studies have evaluated these new tools but most of them were limited to subgroups of children notably to the young [13], [14], to hospitalized children [11], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], or for selected pathogens [10], [12], [18], [19].",

            "text": "An interesting finding of this study is the large proportion of viral coinfection (43.5%), much higher than that previously reported [10], [12], [30], notably for bocavirus, metapneumovirus and adenovirus that were detected in association with at least one other virus in more than 80% of the CAP cases involving these agents (Table 2). It has been suggested that infection by several viruses could enhance the severity of CAP [12], [30], [31], [32]. In the present study, a trend was observed in the association between the mean number of infectious agents and the severity of CAP as defined above (P\n = 0.09); a larger effective size would have been needed to determine a statistically significant difference.",

This situation represents half of the cases recorded in this study: 62 children (72.9%) were less than five-years old, and 40 of them presented a mild or moderate CAP, which corresponds to 47.1% of all cases. The use of a rapid molecular test detecting a large set of viral and bacterial pathogens within 2 or 3 hours, such as that described in [33], would allow an improvement in the management of the antimicrobial treatment. In the case of positive result, it would be recommended to avoid the use of amoxicillin as a first-intent therapy (or to prescribe erythromycin in the case of detection of an agent of atypical pneumonia) and to reconsider the use of antimicrobial treatment 24\u201348 h later according to the clinical evolution and to the results of bacterial cultures. Conversely, the negativity of the rapid test would lead to the empiric prescription of amoxicillin, as currently recommended [4], [5], [6]. It is obvious that this attitude would be dedicated to CAP with mild or moderate symptoms and that CAP with severe presentation at entry should include a systematic probabilistic antimicrobial therapy, whatever the results of PCR assay. The present results are indicative that this strategy could dramatically reduce the proportion of unnecessary antimicrobial treatments in mild or moderate child CAP. Wider studies are needed to prospectively evaluate the benefits of this approach in terms of patient recovery, prevention of antibiotic resistance and medical economy.",
