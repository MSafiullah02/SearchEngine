This is especially the case during pandemics that have high rates of infection, 48 significant morbidity, lack of therapeutic measures, and rapid increases in cases, all of which 49 apply to the current COVID-19 pandemic. A consequence of poor risk communication and 50 heightened risk perception is hoarding behavior, which can lead to lack of medications and 51 personal protective equipment. One potential way to ensure appropriate risk communication is 52 utilizing social media channels, and ensuring an ongoing consistent media presence. Another 53 important step is to include all stakeholders including members of the allergy community in 54 broader public health messaging. As we continue to face unprecedented times in the allergy 55 community, an understanding and appreciation of risk communication will be essential as we 56 communicate with, and inform, our patients, and our colleagues, moving forward. threats to their health, economic or social well-being.\"(9) There are two broad risk models that 79 are commonly used . The first is the realist approach, whereby risk is seen to be objective and 80 independent of social context. The second is the social constructionist approach whereby risk is 81 seen to be interrelated with sociocultural context.(10) It is increasingly recognized that society, 82 communities, and our patients view risk from a social constructionist approach.(10) 83",

Healthcare resource 67 reallocation at this time includes restricting access to all but the most essential ambulatory 68 visits by shifting this to virtual visits for most ongoing primary and specialty care.(4-6) Multiple 69 guidelines have emerged from international societies on the management of care during 70 COVID-19, including a North American guideline on contingency planning for allergy and 71 immunology clinics during a pandemic and a Canadian Pediatric Society statement on asthma 72 management during COVID-19.(7,8) 73 In such unequalled and unstable times, circumstances are changing and information 74 rapidly evolving. A focus must not be just on the transmission of reliable and up to date 75 information but also on the role of proper and effective risk communication. 76 Risk communication, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), is \"the 77 exchange of real-time information, advice and opinions between experts and people facing 78",

            "text": "94 factors\" which largely apply to the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.(10) These include high rates 95 of infection, significant morbidity and mortality, lack of protective or therapeutic measures, and 96 rapid increases in cases or case fatality rates (CFR).(10) These factors can be drivers of serious, 97 and often unmeasurable, consequences resulting from heightened risk perception. In our 98 specialty, a salient and poignant example is the recent shortage of metered dose inhaler (MDI) 99 asthma quick-relief medications (e.g., albuterol/salbutamol) all over the world including 100 Canada, the United States, and Australia, given the high risk of nebulized versions of these 101 medications increasing the risk of viral aerosolization and infection transmission.(8,14-16) 102Multiple countries have been required to place restrictions on prescription medications such as 103 bronchodilators (as well as anti-malarial and certain antibiotics) due to \"hoarding\" and in an 104 attempt \"to control stockpiling by customers.\"(15,17) An Australian news article from March 105 25, 2020 highlights the concern of asthmatics in Australia who have run out of their albuterol 106 supply, noting this to be \"endangering the lives of people with chronic illnesses\" such as our 107 allergic patients.(17) 108 Another example is insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect 109 physicians from infection risk, including allergists and immunologists, at this time.(18) The 110 World Health Organization has noted that PPE shortages \"are leaving doctors, 111 nurses..dangerously ill-equipped to care for\u2026patients, due to limited access to supplies\" largely 112 as a result of \"panic buying, hoarding and misuse.\"(18) This global lack of PPE is attributed, at 113 least in part, to high public consumer fear and demand.(19) Lack of access to PPE has far-114 reaching consequences. PPE is recommended in the care of anyone with suspected COVID-19 115 by multiple health organizations including the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 116 forcing physicians to choose between protecting themselves and caring for their patients.(20) In a recent poignant editorial in The Lancet the global shortage of PPE was described, noting that 118 medical staff are seeing infected, or possibly infected, patients without proper protective 119 equipment.(21) Data out of China suggests more than 3300 healthcare workers have been 120 infected by COVID-19 as of early March, with at least 22 fatalities, though this number has 121 exceeded 50 in Italy by late March.(21,22) North American healthcare worker fatality numbers 122 remain unclear at present. 123 It must also be appreciated that there is a 'trickle up' effect of risk perception, as the 124 public informs policy makers, who to some degree must adhere to the requests and 125 perceptions of their constituents. As a result, the public's perception of risk informs 126 policymakers, who are inherently subject to a broader sociocultural context when 127 communicating and responding to information.(10) 128 Lessons in risk communication are usually retroactive, and therefore cannot be 129 informed by the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, the SARS 2003 epidemic in Canada 130 provides our specialty lessons that are useful in how to communicate risk effectively in these 131 times, that we could integrate both with our patients directly and more broadly within policy 132 and public health realms. 133 One potential way to ensure appropriate risk communication is through use of social 134 media, as the public largely relies on media and social relationships to inform their level of risk 135 perception.(23-26) A significant mitigator of the SARS epidemic was the degree of fear and 136 uncertainty of families in Canada, heightened as healthcare was \"unable to provide them with 137 much information.\"(27) The CDC states that utilization of social media for public health 138 messaging accomplishes several goals of successful risk communication including reaching 139 diverse audiences, establishing interactive and ongoing community engagement, facilitating 140 public control and empowerment, and increasing the likely impact/broadening the transmission 141 of urgent public health communications.(28,29) Recommendations include that allergy societies 142 should have their websites contain as up-to-date information as possible, and serve as 143 educational platforms both for physicians and for our patients. Using multiple forms of social 144 media including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube videos allows the message to be dispersed 145 more widely within the general public.(30,31) A second important lesson learned from SARS is to ensure an ongoing, consistent 147 relationships with the media, as with SARS \"daily headlines generated widespread fear and 148 panic.\"(27) It is recommended that \"efforts to decrease sensationalism, to portray an honest 149 picture, and to elicit the help and understanding of the public\" are lessons that can be applied 150 to any epidemic or pandemic.(27) As noted by the WHO, a significant part of effective risk 151 communication involves the \"identification and management of rumours, and 152 misinformation.\"(9) Assigning one team from each allergy society to be a media resource and 153 presence, with ongoing communication between these groups, helps ensure a consistent 154 message is conveyed through the media for our patients who are most concerned about the 155 effects of this virus with their underlying conditions, in particular our immunocompromised and 156 asthmatic patients.(32,33) A COVID-19 taskforce was recently appointed by the AAAAI, to 157 handle these issues.(34) 158 Another important step moving forward is involving all stakeholders, including members 159 of the allergy community, in the broader public health messaging. The goal of risk 160 communication is its bi-directional nature which is meant to be inherently collaborative and not 161 a didactic message from physician to public. (35) Finally, it is important to remember with all 162 public health messaging through our specialty that risk is composed of actual hazard, and the 163 public perception of hazard. As noted in a recent book on risk communication, \"We have these 164 two very different activities, both called risk communication: alerting people and reassuring 165 them.\"(36) 166 Clear and pertinent guidance is emerging from allergy societies about the management 167 of allergic conditions during COVID-19",
