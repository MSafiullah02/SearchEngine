The F proteins also mediate coalescence of neighboring cells to form the characteristic syncytial cells for which the virus receives its name (Ryan and Ray 2010). The epidemiologic and biologic significance of the two antigenic variants of RSV is uncertain. However, there is some evidence to suggest that Group A infections tend to be more severe (Domachowske and Rosenberg 1999; Ryan and Ray 2010).",

The incubation period is followed by rhinitis and, in quick succession, within 1\u20133 additional days, by manifestations of bronchiolitis or pneumonitis. Manifestations of both bronchiolitis and pneumonia include fever, cough, and dyspnea. These manifestations are age related and tend to be severe in infants. The overall duration of the illness is up to 14 days. Older infants, children, and adults are also readily infected, but the disease in these age groups tends to be milder. One exception is elderly adult patients, who are prone to experience considerable morbidity. The greater severity of the disease in infants is believed to be related to inherent narrow airways and further narrowing of the tracheobronchial tree brought about by mucosal swelling.",

Studies to date have shown a significant connection between RSV infection and childhood asthma (Mohapatra and Boyapalle 2008). This connection is more applicable to children experiencing RSV bronchiolitis during the first decade of life as opposed to older children. The nature of the asthma-like features of RSV infection has not been elucidated, but a common pathogenetic mechanism between RSV infection and asthma involving molecules derived from eosinophiles such as major basic protein and eosinophilic cationic protein may be at play (Ishioka et al. 2011). Radiographic changes include multifocal air space consolidation and peribronchial thickening. In adults, bilateral interstitial opacities and multifocal consolidation are present (Zaki and Paddock 2008).",

            "text": "In contrast to other viruses such as influenza that affect multiple organs and systems, RSV infections are limited to the respiratory tract. In RSV, the lungs may be heavy and diffusely firm and may show areas of atelectasis. Large and small airways can contain necrotic debris and mucus and may show mucosal ulcerations. Within a short time of infection, a striking interstitial mononuclear (chiefly lymphocytic) pneumonia develops. The virus replicates in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells and after maturation buds off from cell membranes, spreading to neighboring cells. The epithelial cells swell, desquamate, and die, mixing with mucoid secretions and forming casts that partially or completely block the lumen of smaller airways (Haselton 1996). Cases with associated diffuse alveolar damage do occur. In addition, organizational changes and secondary bacterial superinfection may supervene (Zaki and Paddock 2001). Giant cell pneumonia with numerous multinucleated giant cells is characteristic but not pathognomonic, as it may occur in other conditions including aspiration pneumonitis and other viral pneumonias (see differential diagnosis below). The multinucleated giant cells contain many somewhat peripherally distributed nuclei. These inclusions may be inconspicuous and may be difficult to identify with any degree of certainty. The diagnosis of RSV pneumonia can be made with some assurance when variably sized but generally small, irregular, slightly granular, and weakly eosinophilic inclusions are found in the cytoplasm of alveolar and/or bronchiolar epithelial cells (Fig. 11.1) (Sherri\u2019s Medical Micro 2010; Zaki and Paddock 2001, 2008).\n\n",

RSV grows in HEp2 cells, HeLa cells, and cells adapted from type II human alveolar epithelial carcinoma cells, known as A549. Optimal specimens can be obtained by gentle aspiration of nasal or nasopharyngeal secretions or more commonly by nasal swabs. RSV can also be detected in macrophages recovered from BAL fluids or from epithelial cells of patients with a background of marrow, heart, lung, or renal transplants (Collins and Crowe 2002; Haselton 1996). In addition to viral isolation, the diagnosis can be established by direct detection of viral antigen in clinical specimens, using enzyme-linked immunoassay, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, or detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR or by demonstration of a rise in RSV-specific serum antibodies. The virus is extremely labile and does not survive long, and attempts at culture isolation may fail if there is a delay in the submission of the clinical specimen to the laboratory (Zaki and Paddock 2008). Another diagnostic modality is ultrastructural analysis of the virion. An analysis showing pleomorphic features, size within recognized limits (see above), and numerous 12 nm glycoprotein spikes coupled with appropriate clinical and serological data can be regarded as consistent with RSV infection. In our laboratory we screen specimens with a solid-phase EIA, a test that has good specificity and a rapid (less than 1 h) turnaround time. In the event of a negative EIA result, we proceed with a more sensitive test such as direct immunofluorescence (DFA), viral culture, or molecular testing. The sensitivity of DFA is comparable to that of viral culture and, if positive, can be regarded as diagnostic.",

In HIV-infected children, infection by Pneumocystis jiroveci should also be considered (Collins and Crowe 2002). Viral pneumonias other than RSV pneumonia can be manifested histopathologically as inflammatory processes containing large or giant multinucleated giant cells. These pneumonias include measles, parainfluenza, and varicella/herpes zoster pneumonias. Human metapneumovirus (MPV) produces changes comparable to RSV and should also be included in the differential diagnosis (Kradin and Mark 2010). A helpful hint is that children in pediatric ICUs infected with MPV are likely to be older than those with RSV infection and more likely to present with pneumonia rather than a bronchiolitis type of illness (Paget et al. 2011).",

The role of ribavirin in adults is less well documented, but some reports indicate favorable results in adults with RSV infections. An exception is RSV infection associated with clinical ARDS syndrome in previously healthy adults. In this setting, the mortality rate is very high, 40\u201360 % as reported by Luo et al. (2011).

Ultrastructurally, the viral agent, a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, shows unique spheroidal particles and long filamentous forms. Two antigenic groups are recognized, A and B. RSV subgroup A appears to be more virulent. Clinically, the illness is an acute type of bronchiolitis that may progress to pneumonia. The histopathologic hallmark is an interstitial pneumonia with multiple multinucleated (syncytial) giant cells. The differential diagnosis rests upon exclusion of other acute viral pneumonias, particularly measles, parainfluenza, and varicella/herpes zoster pneumonia. A definitive diagnosis can be made by isolation of the virus in cell culture media. Ribavirin is an effective agent in children, but its usefulness in adults has not been clearly documented. A safe effective vaccine is not available, but prophylaxis with neutralizing antibodies can help to reduce the need for hospitalization in some children.",
