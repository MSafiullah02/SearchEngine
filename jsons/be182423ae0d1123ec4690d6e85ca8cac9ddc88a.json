Although T2DM and the metabolic syndrome increase the risk of more severe symptoms and mortality in many infectious diseases, there are some additional specific mecha nistic aspects in coronavirus infections that require separate consideration, which will have clinical consequences for improved management of patients who are severely affected.",

This glycoprotein, which is found on the surface of the virus, binds to the ectoenzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2; located on human cells) to gain entry into the cell. In addition, the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 is required to prime viral entry via ACE2 4 . In the respiratory system, ACE2 has the function of degrading angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7 and acts as a key regulatory point for the angiotensin system. When ACE1 activity is increased and ACE2 inhibited, intact angiotensin II acts via the angiotensin 1 receptor (AT1R) or AT2R to exert pro-inflammatory responses and stimulate aldosterone secretion; these effects not only increase blood pressure and potentially cause hypokalaemia, but will also increase vascular permeability locally, increasing the risk of respiratory distress syndrome. By contrast, angiotensin 1-7 acts on the Mas receptor pathway, which leads to anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic responses that would be favourable to the recovery of patients with COVID-19 5 . It could be postu lated that individuals with more severe COVID-19 have an imbalance in the activation of these pathways, with an increase in the activation of AT1R and AT2R, which could be the case in T2DM, hypertension and insulin-resistant states.",

As the human endocrine pancreas expresses ACE2, the coronavirus might enter islets and cause acute \u03b2-cell dysfunction, leading to acute hyperglycaemia and transient T2DM 6 . More importantly, evidence in diabetic mice demonstrated that ACE2 activity levels were enhanced in the pancreas 7 . This finding suggests that patients with T2DM might be particularly vulnerable to a coronavirus infection. Likewise, T2DM induces expression of angiotensin-converting enzymes in other tissues, including lung, liver and heart 7 , which explains why T2DM can contribute mechanistically to multi-organ failure in SARS-CoV infections.",

Hence, they might have a limited role in the management of patients with COVID-19.
