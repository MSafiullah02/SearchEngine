In 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that smallpox (Variola) \u2013 a devastating human disease caused by Variola virus (VARV) \u2013 was eradicated (Fenner et al., 1988, Barquet and Domingo, 1997, Smith and McFadden, 2002). With its eradication, vaccination was discontinued. As a consequence, much of the world\u2019s population has either never been immunized or has not been immunized for more than 30 years. Either scenario results in a population that is extremely susceptible to variola or other poxviruses.",

            "text": "Our laboratory is interested in dissecting poxvirus-host cell interactions. We have observed that pharmacological inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway with UO126 or PD98059 decreased virus yield by at least one order of magnitude (de Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2001, Andrade et al., 2004). Moreover, pretreatment of cells with LY294002, a pharmacological inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathway, decreased Vaccinia virus (VACV) or Cowpox virus (CPXV) replication by 99% (Soares et al., 2009). Here we show that SP600125, an anthrapyrazolone inhibitor of the c-JUN N-terminal kinases 1/2 (JNK1/2) (Bennett et al., 2001), caused a significant decrease in viral yield of VACV, CPXV and modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA). Although SP600125 is regarded as a specific JNK inhibitor (Bennett et al. 2001), our findings demonstrate that its antipoxviral effect is mediated through the target of a yet undefined kinase(s) other than JNK1/2. Since SP600125 has proved to be efficient in vitro against diverse viral infections such as influenza (Mehrotra et al., 2007), rotavirus (Holloway et al., 2006) and herpesvirus (Zapata et al., 2007, Hamza et al., 2004, Perkins et al., 2003, Chen et al., 2002), we propose a potential use of this compound to treat poxviruses infection or complications associated with vaccination.",

Our data (Fig. 1\nA and B) demonstrated that both CPXV and VACV infections were able to stimulate JNK1/2 phosphorylation (JNK1/2-P) as early as 3 h.p.i., and to a maximal level reached at late times in the infective cycle, 36 h.p.i. As a control, and as expected, we observed no difference in the levels of ERK1/2 during infection. Additionally, viral stimulation of JNK1/2-P was blocked in a dose-dependent manner [10, 20, 40 and 50 \u03bcM (Fig. 1C, lanes 4\u20137)] when VACV infection was performed in the continued presence of SP600125.

Cellular extracts were collected at 3, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h.p.i and assayed for viral yield. We observed that the SP600125-mediated inhibition played a relevant role in both VACV and CPXV biology. A significant reduction in the viral titers (\u2a7e1 log reduction) was observed when VACV (Fig. 2\nA) or CPXV (Fig. 2B) infections were carried out in the continued presence of SP600125. To verify that the inhibitory effect associated with SP600125 was not restricted to the A31 cells, BSC-40 were infected with VACV or CPXV as described above. As shown in Fig. 2C and D, treatment with SP600125 resulted in a severe decrease in viral production (2\u20133 log reduction) thereby demonstrating that viral growth inhibition is not cell-type specific. Additionally, we investigated whether SP600125 was able to affect MVA replication. To that end, BHK-21 cells were infected with MVA as described above. Again, our results showed (Fig 2E) that the inhibitor caused a significant decline in virus yield (nearly 3 log reduction); while a more mild decrease (1 log) in infectivity was noted with VACV and CPXV (2F and 2G). The variation in the levels of inhibition caused by SP600125 might be due to the viruses\u2019 tropism within different species such as murine (A31 cells), monkey (BSC-40 cells) and hamster (BHK-21 cells).",

Thus, to further define whether the reduction in viral yields associated with SP600125 treatment was a direct consequence of JNK1/2 inhibition, WT (Fig. 4\nA) or JNK1/2 KO MEF cells (Fig. 4B) were infected with VACV or with CPXV. Infections were carried out either in the absence or presence of SP600125 (40 \u03bcM) or the pharmacological inhibitor of JNK (JNKi VIII - 4 \u03bcM). After 24 h, infected cells were collected and assayed for viral production. As shown in Fig. 4A and B, in the absence of any inhibitor, the viral titers were comparable when produced in either cell line (WT or JNK KO cells lines). This observation strongly suggests that neither VACV nor CPXV require JNK for productive infection. Furthermore, both the WT and JNK KO cells were equally susceptible to SP600125, while being refractory to JNKi VIII treatment.",

Fig. 4C shows that both SP600125 and JNKi VIII affected VACV- and CPXV-stimulated c-Jun phosphorylation (c-Jun-P). Taken together these findings demonstrated that even though both pharmacological inhibitors targeted the same downstream substrate of JNK (c-Jun), viral replication was only affected in the presence of SP600125.

In 2009, it was shown that cidofovir impairs Vaccinia DNA encapsidation and, consequently, affects viral morphogenesis (Jesus et al., 2009). In humans, cidofovir has been used successfully against Molluscum contagiosum virus and ORF virus, however renal toxicity is a known side effect caused by this drug (De Clercq, 2002). Importantly, cidofovir-resistant strains of camelpox, cowpox, monkeypox and vaccinia viruses have also been isolated (Smee et al., 2002). To overcome nephrotoxicity, a derivative form of CDV has been generated and tested. CMX001 is a lipid conjugate of the acyclic nucleotide phosphonate and is currently in Phase II clinical trials for the prophylaxis of human cytomegalovirus infection and under development using the Animal Rule for smallpox infection. CMX001 has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy against orthopoxvirus infections, and no evidence of nephrotoxicity in either animals or humans was found. Both drugs target the viral DNA polymerase, and VACV strains have been shown to be cross resistant to CMX001 as well.",

One of them, ST-246, has been intensely tested against a number of Orthopoxvirus species in animal studies (Yang et al., 2005a, Yang et al., 2005b, Sbrana et al., 2007, Quenelle et al., 2007). ST-246 specifically inhibits the viral protein F13, which is required for the formation of enveloped virus forms. Similar to CDV in which viral resistance is conferred by point mutations in the DNA polymerase gene (Becker et al., 2008), it has also been described that a single point mutation in F13 conferred resistance to ST-246 (Yang et al., 2005a, Yang et al., 2005b). ST-246 was recently tested in a Phase I clinical trial and found to be well tolerated and safe in healthy humans (Jordan et al., 2008, Jordan et al., 2010).",

            "text": "An additional approach to inhibit viral multiplication is targeting cellular signaling pathways stimulated and required for successful replication and dissemination. In the past years, we and others have shown the ability of the Orthopoxviruses VACV and CPXV to induce protein kinases pathways to provide an adequate environment to favor their viral replication cycles (de Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2001, Andrade et al., 2004, da Silva et al., 2006, Mercer and Helenius, 2008, Soares et al., 2009, McNulty et al., 2010). It is also known that poxviruses use the Src and Abl family kinase activities to modulate intracellular spread and release (Frischknecht et al., 1999, Reeves et al., 2005, Reeves et al., 2011) but only the Abl family of kinases mediate release of CEV to form EEV (Reeves et al., 2005). Therefore, tyrosine kinase inhibitors originally developed for treating cancers have also been tested against many poxviruses. One of these drugs is imatinib mesylate (STI-571; Gleevec), which is approved for treating human cancers (Tolomeo et al., 2009, Wolf and Rumpold, 2009). Gleevec specifically inhibits the Abl family of kinases, reducing VACV dissemination in vivo (Reeves et al., 2005). It has been suggested that cardiotoxicity can be a side-effect caused by this drug; but even targeting cellular kinases may bring attention about unwanted side effects (Kerkel\u00e4 et al., 2006), it seems that drug resistance cannot readily develop, which is a benefit for antiviral chemotherapy.",

Some derivatives of SP600125 are being tested in diverse clinical trials (Manning and Davis, 2003, Bogoyevitch et al., 2004, Bennett, 2006, Bogoyevitch and Arthur, 2008). In addition, the antiviral effects of SP600125 have been investigated in diverse viral models suggesting that JNK inhibitors may provide new therapeutic interventions (Manning and Davis, 2003, Bogoyevitch and Arthur, 2008). For instance, it has been shown that the viral kinase ORF36 of the Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus activates JNK1/2 and its inhibition by SP600125 blocks viral gene expression at late stages of infection (Hamza et al., 2004). Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) replication was also decreased in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with SP600125 (Zapata et al., 2007). Another report showed that SP600125 inhibited the activation of JNK by the hepatitis C virus protein NS3, which contributes to hepatitis C related hepatocarcinogenesis (Hassan et al., 2005). Furthermore, the use of signal transduction pathways modulators, either singly (Yang et al., 2005a, Yang et al., 2005b, Reeves et al., 2005) or in combination, could be the most appropriate therapeutic strategy. In fact, it has been shown that SP600125 used together with inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt prevented the establishment of persistent SARS-CoV infection (Mizutani et al., 2005).",

Our results showed a dramatic reduction in virus yield when infections were performed in the presence of this inhibitor. Electron microscope images demonstrated that in the presence of SP600125, Orthopoxviruses replication is compromised; normal-looking IVs are frequently seen but IVN are very rare and no IMVs could be detected (Fig 3, Bottom panel). SP600125 is considered as a specific pharmacological inhibitor of JNK1/2, not only in response to cytokine stimulation (Dong et al., 2000), but also with viral infections (Bogoyevitch and Arthur, 2008). Our results show that upon VACV or CPXV infection JNK1/2 is activated during the entire viral cycle and SP600125, indeed, inhibits JNK1/2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 1C). However, the block identified in the viral cycle caused by SP600125 is an event that occurs independently of JNK1/2 since no effect on viral yield was observed when infections were performed in JNK1/2 KO MEF cells. Similar results were found with the use of JNKi VIII inhibitor.",

Furthermore, since its discovery in 2001, SP600125 has been extensively studied for treatment of numerous non-viral diseases in murine model (Ikezumi et al., 2004, Gao et al., 2005, Han et al., 2005, Gunawan et al., 2006, Guan et al., 2006, Takamura et al., 2007, Syrkina et al., 2007, Hu and Liu, 2009). However, up to the publication of this work, a search in the literature did not show a single report demonstrating that SP600125 is effective against viral infection in animal studies to support the results observed in cell culture system. Furthermore, studies have shown that viral infection can lead to JNK activation and the inhibition of these cellular kinases by SP600125 affects viral multiplication (Hamza et al., 2004, Hassan et al., 2005, Zapata et al., 2007, Gupta et al., 2011).",

Because JNK is only one of the kinases targeted by this drug, additional analyses with other inhibitors of JNK1/2 or cell lines knockouts for those kinases or even RNAi approach should be taken into consideration to confirm this direct relationship. Therefore, since animal studies are a cost, time and energy-dependent system, it is possible that researchers are more careful about taking a step further and testing SP600125 in mice, for instance, and do not succeed in correlating the data observed in tissue culture. Additional disadvantages of SP600125 may be considerable off-target activity, or perhaps its poor solubility in aqueous solution or/and possible undesirable side-effects (Bennett et al., 2001, Bain et al., 2003, Begleiter et al., 2006). In effort to get around these complications, a derivative of SP600125 (CC-401) was developed by Celgene has successfully completed a Phase I trial in healthy volunteers as stated by the pharmaceutical company. CC-401 has also been reported in Phase II evaluation for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, and has also been considered for the treatment of respiratory diseases (Roberts and Der, 2007, Bogoyevitch and Arthur, 2008). Nevertheless, a shortest path to evaluate SP600125 in vivo against an orthopoxvirus infection would be a viral challenge in a murine model.",

            "text": "Taken together, questions still remain regarding the potential protein kinase(s) targeted by SP600125 during Orthopoxvirus infection causing the impairment of viral morphogenesis. Poxviruses encode two essential serine/threonine kinases, B1 (Traktman et al., 1989, Lin et al., 1992, Rempel and Traktman, 1992) and F10 (Lin and Broyles, 1994). While B1 plays a function during viral DNA replication (Traktman et al., 1989, Rempel et al., 1990, Domi and Beaud, 2000), F10 plays a role in the very early stages of virion morphogenesis (Wang and Shuman, 1995, Traktman et al., 1995). When B1 or F10 proteins are repressed or inactive, none of the hallmarks of morphogenesis are identified. Therefore, it is doubtful that SP600125 would target one or both viral kinases. In addition, some viral proteins that play a role in morphogenesis are proposed to be also phosphorylated by cellular kinases (Resch et al., 2005, Trindade et al., 2007, Wickramasekera and Traktman, 2010). By comparison with electron microscopy images of VACV mutants, under nonpermissive conditions, we observed that some of them phenotypically copy our results when infections are performed in the presence of SP600125. The repression of the phosphoprotein A13L arrests morphogenesis at the stage of IV formation. Essentially, no IMVs are seen and IVNs are rare; DNA crystalloids accumulate in the cytoplasm (Unger and Traktman, 2004). A similar phenotype is also seen when H3L, a major immunodominant protein, is repressed or deleted (da Fonseca et al., 2000). When the myristoylated L1R protein is repressed, the transition from IV to IMV is blocked (Ravanello et al., 1994). Thus far, it is hard to predict a putative cellular target for SP600125 that would affect viral morphogenesis. Steps that prior and subsequently lead to the formation and maturation of IMVs are very complex and not fully understood. Protein phosphorylation, protein\u2013protein interactions and proteolytic processing are some of the events involved. Since cellular kinases are likely thought to contribute to phosphorylation of viral proteins, it is plausible that their inhibition by SP600125 could affect those events blocking morphogenesis progress.",

This suggests that other cellular and/or viral substrates are affected by the action of SP600125. While significant progress has been made in the discovery of novel compounds against Orthopoxviruses, the need for a range of antiviral drugs is imperative since the occurrence of resistance to antiviral drugs is not a rare event. Our data support the notion that SP600125 can be regarded as a potential antipoxviral compound; the combined use of SP600125 with other antipoxviral drugs may enhance their antiviral activity and, perhaps, minimize major side effects with the advantage of reducing drug resistance.",
