            "text": "Schistosomiasis is a debilitating parasitic disease that affects more than 200 million people worldwide and causes approximately 280,000 deaths per year. Inside the definitive host, eggs released by Schistosoma mansoni lodge in the intestine and especially in the liver where they induce a granulomatous inflammatory process, which can lead to fibrosis. The molecular mechanisms initiating or promoting hepatic granuloma formation remain poorly understood. Inflammasome activation has been described as an important pathway to induce pathology mediated by NLRP3 receptor. Recently, other components of the inflammasome pathway, such as NLRP6, have been related to liver diseases and fibrotic processes. Nevertheless, the contribution of these components in schistosomiasis-associated pathology is still unknown. In the present study, using dendritic cells, we demonstrated that NLRP6 sensor is important for IL-1\u03b2 production and caspase-1 activation in response to soluble egg antigens (SEA). Furthermore, the lack of NLRP6 has been shown to significantly reduce periovular inflammation, collagen deposition in hepatic granulomas and mRNA levels of \u03b1-SMA and IL-13. Livers of Nlrp6 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed reduced levels of CXCL1/KC, CCL2, CCL3, IL-5, and IL-10 as well as Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Eosinophilic Peroxidase (EPO) enzymatic activity. Consistently, the frequency of macrophage and neutrophil populations were lower in the liver of NLRP6 knockout mice, after 6 weeks of infection. Finally, it was further demonstrated that the onset of hepatic granuloma and collagen deposition were also compromised in Caspase-1 \u2212/\u2212 , IL-1R \u2212/\u2212 and Gsdmd \u2212/\u2212 mice. Our findings suggest that the NLRP6 inflammasome is an important component for schistosomiasis-associated pathology.",

This disease leads to approximately 200,000 deaths annually and severely compromises the life quality from those affected. Among causative species, Schistosoma haematobium, Schistosoma japonicum, and Schistosoma mansoni stand out as those of major importance to human health (1) (2) (3) . Infection occurs through the direct contact of the host with the parasite's larval form. After parasite penetration and sexual development, egg laying begins. The release of eggs in the feces and its hatching in the environment closes the parasite's life cycle (4) . However, a significant amount of these eggs is trapped in some of the host's organs, such as liver and intestine, where they induce a granulomatous inflammatory reaction (5, 6) . Hepatic granulomatous inflammation arises from the egg-secreted antigens, which perform hepatotoxic and immunological activities capable of recruiting immune cells to the organ and forming periovular granuloma. The composition of the granuloma includes macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, T and B lymphocytes and especially fibroblasts, responsible for the fibrotic characteristic of the structure (7, 8) .",

The role of intracellular immune receptors in granuloma formation, for instance, was first described in a seminal study conducted by Ritter and colleagues (9) . However, a better understanding of cytosolic sensors during S. mansoni infection is required. These intracellular receptors are those responsible for activating the inflammasome pathway. This pathway induces the formation of an intracellular protein complex typically consisting of Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD), leucine-rich repeat (LRR)containing protein (NLR) family members, an adapter molecule known as ASC, and the cysteine protease caspase-1 as an effector molecule. Activation of this pathway leads to cleavage of immature forms of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 into their mature forms. It might also induce cell death by pyroptosis. The inflammasome activation takes place in both immune and non-immune cells and is essentially triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and Danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) (10, 11) .",

Ritter and colleagues (2010) reported that SEA induces inflammasome activation in DCs and described the involvement of NLRP3 (9). Thus, given the relevance of these cells, we decided to use bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) in order to investigate whether the NLRP6 sensor is involved in IL-1\u03b2 secretion in response to different parasite antigens. Using Pam 3 Cys (P 3 Cys) as the first signal, we observed that eggs and their soluble antigens (SEA) induce high levels of IL-1\u03b2 and this production was partially influenced by NLRP6 (Figure 1A) . In contrast, IL-1\u03b2 production induced by soluble adult worm antigens (SWAP) was much lower compared to SEA ( Figure 1A) . Additionally, TNF-\u03b1 levels were not altered comparing both WT and NLRP6 knockout (KO) mice ( Figure 1B) . Since SEA was sufficient to induce IL-1\u03b2 production, we used this stimulus to evaluate the role of NLRP6 in caspase-1 (casp-1) activation. Figures 1C,D demonstrate that SEA induces activation of casp-1 in WT DCs and this process was clearly inhibited in Nlrp6 \u2212/\u2212 DCs.",

Initially, we observed that the number of eggs per gram of tissue was not altered between WT and knockout mice (Figure 2A) . Consistently, the worm burden recovery was the same comparing both groups (Supplementary Figure S2) .

We observed that 6-week-infected Nlrp6 \u2212/\u2212 and WT mice presented no significant difference regarding CD11b + CD11c + (dendritic cells) and CD3 + CD4 + (CD4 + lymphocytes) cell populations (Figures 3A,B) .

Both antigens induced increased levels of IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 in splenocyte culture supernatants from Nlrp6 \u2212/\u2212 compared to WT mice (Figures 3E,F) . Additionally, NLRP6 appears to have no effect on IL-5 and IL-13 production (Figures 3C,D) . Curiously, when Nlrp6 \u2212/\u2212 and WT spleen cells from S. mansoni infected mice were stimulated with SWAP, no significant difference on IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, IL-5, and IL-13 levels was observed (Supplementary Figure S4) .

Initially, we evaluated the level of chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL11, and CXCL1) in livers of Schistosoma-infected mice. These chemokines have already been described as related to granuloma formation. In Schistosoma-infected Nlrp6 \u2212/\u2212 mice only the production of CCL11 was not reduced in comparison to WT mice ( Figure 4D) . CCL2, CXCL1, and CCL3 were diminished in Nlrp6 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT animals (Figures 4A-C) . Additionally, we observed that the enzymes MPO and EPO were also reduced in Nlrp6 \u2212/\u2212 mice when compared to WT (Figures 4E,F) . Our next step was to evaluate which non-parenchymal cell populations could be altered in Schistosoma-infected Nlrp6 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Cells were obtained following the gate strategy described in Supplementary Figure S5 . Neutrophils and macrophages were the major cell populations reduced in Nlrp6 \u2212/\u2212 mice when compared to WT (Figures 4G,H) . The frequency of dendritic cells and CD4 + T lymphocytes remained unaltered in either mouse groups (Figures 4I,J) . We also found that the lack of NLRP6 does not affect macrophage polarization, even though there is a strong tendency of reduction in anti-inflammatory macrophages (CD206 + CD163 + ) in Nlrp6 \u2212/\u2212 compared to WT mice (Supplementary Figure S6) . Therefore, the NLRP6 sensor possibly induces the formation of hepatic granuloma by favoring chemokine production and the recruitment of immune cells to the liver.",

Inflammasome triggers or amplify liver diseases by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-1\u03b1, IL-18, and also through other inflammatory mediators such as High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) (35) . Release of such cytokines and DAMPs occur, in part, due to Gasdermin-D cleavage and subsequent pyroptosis of the cell (36) . The fibrotic process resulting from chronic liver diseases has also involved the inflammasome pathway. IL-1\u03b2 and danger signals induce Hepatic Stellate Cells (HSC) to transdifferentiate and perform extracellular matrix remodeling function.

After Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) treatment, NAFLD condition improves and the expression of both NLR receptors decreases (20) . Besides, a previous study with NAFLD obese patients demonstrates that when hepatic portal fibrosis is present, the expression of NLRP6 mRNA in adipose tissues is higher compared to cases when hepatic portal fibrosis is not observed (21) .

The long survival period of Schistosoma worms within the human host implies recurrent inflammation and wound-healing cycles in the liver, triggered by egg antigens which can result in fibrosis, portal hypertension and hepatosplenomegaly (4, 8) . Among non-parenchymal liver cells, DCs stand out as key cells during this pathological process. Broadly responsive to egg antigens, DCs are essential for promoting systemic shift in the immune response profile (from Th1 to Th2), which is crucial for host survival upon infection (28, 40) . In addition, the first report of inflammasome pathway activation by S. mansoni antigens involved dendritic cells responding to SEA. For these reasons, we initially decided to evaluate the role of NLRP6 in DCs. Our findings suggest that NLRP6 is important for the formation of the inflammasome complex, since it influences IL-1\u03b2 secretion FIGURE 4 | NLRP6 regulates chemokine production and immune cell recruitment into the liver. After 6 weeks of infection, the liver was used to measure chemokine levels, MPO and EPO activities and the frequency of immune cells. Levels of (A) CCL2, (B) CXCL1 (C) CCL3 and (D) CCL11 were measured by ELISA. (E,F) MPO and EPO activities were also detected. The percentage of (G) CD11b + Ly6G + , (H) CD11b + F4/80, (I) CD11b + CD11c + and (J) CD3 + CD4 + T lymphocyte populations were measured by flow cytometry. An asterisk denotes statistically significant differences between NLRP6 versus WT animals (p < 0.05). NI stands for Non-infected mice. and caspase-1 activation in response to SEA. Previous studies demonstrate that NLRP6 structurally has the ability to form the inflammasome complex and does so in response to grampositive bacteria cell wall components, activating both caspase-1 and caspase-11 in the same complex (41, 42) .",

Surprisingly, we have demonstrated for the first time that NLRP6 also plays an important role in S. mansoni-induced pathology. We found that this sensor influences the formation of hepatic granuloma, altering local chemokine (CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL1) and cytokine (IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13) production, macrophage and neutrophil recruitment into the liver, and also is important for promoting collagen deposition. In Schistosoma egg-induced pathology, chemokine production is essential to modulate granuloma formation (44, 45) . CCL3-deficient mice, for instance, showed size reduced granuloma, lower fibrosis and lower EPO activity in the liver (46) . Although classically responsible for neutrophil recruitment, CXCL1 also impacts on the recruitment of HSCs, which are responsible for collagen Representative images of granulomas detected in hematoxylin and eosin, masson blue and the output from ImageJ software, respectively.

Our findings demonstrate that Casp-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 production, in response to SEA, can be regulated by NLRP6. Therefore, our findings suggest that the role of this receptor in hepatic granuloma formation is due to the inflammasome activation, since Nlrp3 \u2212/\u2212 mice have demonstrated a similar phenotype. It is clear that the inflammasome pathway is important for Schistosoma-induced liver pathology, once we have observed granuloma reduction and lower collagen deposition in Casp-1 \u2212/\u2212 , Gsdmd \u2212/\u2212 , and IL-1R \u2212/\u2212 mice when compared to WT. Previous liver disease studies support our observations for Casp-1 \u2212/\u2212 and IL-1R \u2212/\u2212 mice. In a high fat diet-induced NASH model, deficient Casp-1 animals showed improvement in hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrogenesis (49) . Similarly, IL-1R signaling has been shown to be critical for the progression of steatohepatitis and hepatic fibrosis in hypercholesterolemic mice (50) . The role of Gasdermin-D and pyroptosis has also been described in chronic liver diseases (51, 52) . During human NAFLD/NASH, GSDMD and its N-terminal peptide (GSDMD-N) are upregulated, besides MCD-fed Gsdmd \u2212/\u2212 mice showed decreased severity of steatosis and inflammation comparing to WT (52) . During Schistosoma infection, Liu and colleagues (2019) demonstrated that S. japonicum induces expression of the GSDMD-N in the liver, and that this expression is modulated by NLRP3 sensor (53) . In addition, it has been reported that SEA from S. japonicum eggs induces pyroptosis in HSCs (54) . However, no in vivo mouse study has been reported correlating GSDMD deficiency and granuloma formation and fibrosis induced by S. mansoni infection as demonstrated here.",
