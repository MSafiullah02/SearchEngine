It has been proposed that performing laboratory tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibody can assist in determining who is eligible to return to the workforce. Other proposed uses include helping to guide the relaxation of physical/social distancing and revision of lockdown orders. Antibody testing has the potential to more accurately determine the total number of people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, compared with reported cases. There are, however, a number of potential pitfalls in the deployment and interpretation of antibody tests, and in the vetting of proposed tests. It is important to differentiate two key proposed uses: identify past infection to track the pandemic, and identify possible immune protection that developed from either natural infection or from a future vaccine.",

An HIV vaccine trial was stopped in 2007 by its data safety monitoring board when a statistically significant difference was found in the rates of HIV acquisition. 5 Unfortunately, on unblinding it became clear that those who received the HIV vaccine were at increased risk for HIV infection. 5 An HIV vaccine trial of 5,407 HIV negative volunteers from 14 sites (begun back in 2006) was stopped in 2020, as it showed no efficacy. 6 These efforts demonstrate how long and difficult the road to vaccine development can sometimes be, despite being given high priority.",

A key assumption is that the circulating virus will not mutate in a way to permit reinfection. Of course, it should be noted that the appearance of antibodies per se in a recently infected person does not mean prima facie that this person is no longer infectious. By analogy, studies have shown that in some persons, whose nasopharyngeal swab testing has become negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR, still test positive on lung secretions. Press conference reports from the South Korea CDC claim reversions from negative to positive on swabs and in blood. There is a need for quantitative tests for RNA, as such reversions might simply reflect variability of results near the lower detection limits of the test, or erroneous results. Interpretations must be cautious, since the detection of viral RNA per se does not mean that infectious viral particles are present; re-infection or reactivation should not be presumed.",

Antibody testing can be devised to selectively detect IgG, IgM or IgA antibody responses alone or in combination. The level and/or type of humoral response that detects exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is likely different from test results that would indicate immunity to reinfection. The sensitivity and specificity of antibody testing are two-sides of a coin, and higher values for one of these measures typically reduces the other. 7 To illustrate these concerns, several case scenarios are discussed.",

In this scenario, the predictive value of a positive test will be high. 7, 8 The predictive value of a negative test, however, may be limited. 7 Once carefully assessed trials provide better guidance on the time course for development of various types of detectable antibody responses, the roles of particular assays can be more clearly defined. 2) Antibody testing for a currently asymptomatic person deemed to have had exposure to a person with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection or likely disease, is anticipated to be one of the most important uses. Current epidemiologic data suggest that many persons who become infected only have mild symptoms, and thus may never have been tested by RT-PCR while actively carrying the virus. If the predictive value of a positive antibody test is high, and if data are accrued consistent with the hypothesis that antibody positivity confers protection, such testing may be very useful in deciding that it is safe for that individual to return to employment at a job site -i.e., this person is likely not to be at risk for either transmitting or acquiring infection. This would be especially relevant for situations with a continuing high risk of potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2, such as for health care workers, first responders, or other workers (such as retail clerks) who have many inter-personal contacts in their job. The risk of a false positive test -signifying protection when none exists -would potentially place such a person at risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2, so false positives need to be minimized.",

[7] [8] [9] [10] Since coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2 have been circulating for a long time, infection from some of these might potentially lead to positive antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2. 2) Every aspect of the manufacturing process needs to be carefully detailed by vendors so that the test can be assessed for situations whereby cross-reactivity might develop. For the early HIV tests, virus was grown in cell culture, and remnants of those cells might have existed. The first systematic assessment of an HIV antibody screening test found false positive reactivity in some samples with high HLA reactivity; 8 this was specifically related to persons who had antibodies only to the HLA of the cell line in which the virus was cultured. 10 3) Reactivity may vary with the time since onset of infection, the type of illness that developed or with the severity of the COVID-19 infection. 7.9 In conclusion, a combination of antigen and antibody testing might be used routinely as part of vigorous contact tracing of newly identified cases with an amplified public health workforce. The first step of the U.S. government should be to ramp up efforts to produce accurate and reliable point-of-care antigen tests. 11 Antibody tests have the potential for providing valuable information on whether an individual was previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, which is important for surveillance, and potentially for determining whether the person is immune to reinfection, which may assist in decisions about whether that individual may return to the workforce when new COVID-19 cases are still occurring.
