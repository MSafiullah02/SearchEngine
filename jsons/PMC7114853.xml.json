The minimum droplet size detectable by the paper was 50 \u03bcm, and therefore the paper could detect the average-sized droplets exhaled during coughing and talking (50\u2013100 \u03bcm) in clinical settings [5]. Another set of four sheets of paper was placed on the floor 5 m away from the manikin in all four directions. Tap water (10 mL) thickened with 1 g of potato starch was applied on to the nasal and oral cavities of the manikin to mimic the nasal mucus and saliva of patients. The nasal cannula was inserted into the manikin's nostrils, and the cannula was connected to the high-flow nasal therapy device. The device was then turned on for 10 min at a flow rate of 60 L/min. One hour later, the paper was collected, and the number of spots on the sheets was enumerated. A measurement closest to the manikin's face was performed separately with the same design because the paper may affect the dispersal. As a control experiment, the device was kept in the stand-by mode for 10 min to confirm that there was no detection of water on the paper. In the next experiment, the effect of the patient touching and repositioning the cannula was assessed by manually repositioning the cannula once during use of the device. Three trials for each liquid dispersal experiment were conducted. The values obtained were averaged.",

Dispersal of water and yeast was detected only in the proximal location closest to the manikin's face. Although the manual repositioning of the nasal cannula during use of the device slightly increased the dispersal, the dispersal remained limited to the proximal location closest to the manikin's face. No dispersal of water and yeast was detected in areas >60 cm away from the face.

Air flow generated by the high-flow nasal therapy device is blown into a relatively closed nasal cavity compared with the open space of hand dryers. This may limit much of the droplet dispersal to inside the nasal and oral cavities. Another possible explanation is that the flow volume and velocity of the air flow of the high-flow nasal therapy are relatively small (60 L/min, 30 km/h) compared with those of jet dryers that can be up to 2100 L/min, 640 km/h. Our data suggest that it is likely that high-flow nasal therapy does not increase the potential risk of droplet and contact infection. However, there is a possibility that the device generates smaller particles (aerosol) that may remain in the air and may cause airborne infection rather than droplet infection. Another limitation of this study is that we did not include human subjects. Further studies with human subjects may provide further evidence of the safety of the nasal high-flow therapy.",
