This virus can utilize human receptors and has the potential to replicate in human cells. 2019-nCoV has the potential to cause a pandemic, and it is still being studied in depth to prevent it from becoming a global health threat. Reliable and rapid differential diagnosis and reasonable treatment of diagnosed patients with COVID-19 are still essential to control the epidemic [15,16]. Our study screened 46 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19. The patient was severe viral pneumonia and was fatal. All patients were sent to Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital before February 22, 2020, and their clinical symptoms were very similar to SARS. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can occur in severe patients, and they will require admission to the Intensive Care Unit and assistant treatment with mechanical ventilation.

The global judgment of the severity of COVID-19 is based on the Chinese guidelines, and there is no clinical serum marker for comprehensive judgment. This study shows that in patients with COVID-19, elevated serum HFABP is closely related to the severity of disease in the patients, and there is a significant statistical difference from patients with normal serum HFABP. Therefore, elevated serum HFABP can be used as an indicator of severe COVID-19 and an independent risk factor for patient prognosis. Among the patients in this study, 40 patients were monitored for troponin T, and only 6 patients were positive for troponin T; however, there was no statistical difference between the serum HFABP-negative and HFABP-positive groups. The hypothesis that HFABP is affected by troponin T does not hold, and the serum HFABP levels show an independent stable performance. This can happen because, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, novel coronavirus infections also induce the secretion of a large number of cytokines [17\u201321], leading to inflammatory lung injury, which reduces blood oxygen concentration and puts myocardial cells in a hypoxic state, thereby increasing the release of HFABP into the blood. We noted that 86.7% of patients with elevated serum HFABP are patients with severe COVID-19; therefore, it is of great significance to judge and predict the outcome of patients with severe COVID-19. At present, there is no objective laboratory index for assessing the outcome of patients with COVID-19. Serum HFABP can be used as an effective index; thus, it can guide the clinicians to judge patients with severe COVID-19 in the short term, and elevated HFABP can also severely affect the outcome of patients with COVID-19.",

There was one case in the HFABP positive group, and the other case was in the HFABP negative group. We performed a statistical analysis for these groups, and there was no statistical difference in mortality between the two groups. However, we avoided sensitivity and specificity analysis because the sample size was small and we could not draw convincing conclusions. A larger sample size is needed for further confirmation.",

But serum HFABP negative maybe make patients with mild COVID-19 safer, the current data show no effect on the all-cause mortality. New coronaviruses have acquired effective human transmission capabilities [17,22]. We are deeply aware of the challenges and concerns that our global medical care encounters with COVID-19. Every effort should be made to study and control this disease. Therefore, we recommend worldwide promotion of HFABP application, which will help to judge and predict severe COVID-19.",
