We would like to clarify that the dry heating condition recommended in our paper is 65-70 o C but not 100 o C 3 . The selection of this condition is based on the facts that 1) coronavirus is effectively inactivated at 65 o C or above for 30 minutes 4 , and 2) dry heating at 70 o C or below has minimal effect on the deformation of meltblown polypropylene which comprises the mask filtration material 5 . Due to this limited temperature range, we recommend using a heating apparatus with a temperature adjusting feature such as an oven, incubator, or blanket warmer. A microwave oven is not recommended because there are metal parts in the face mask, the effects on the filter are unknown, and the temperature is not tunable.",

A study by Kariwa et al showed that the infectivity of SARS-CoV was abolished by dry heating at 56 o C for 60 min whereas residual infectivity of SARS-CoV was still detected with UV irradiation of 134 \u00b5W/cm 2 for 60 min 4 . This suggests that SARS-CoV is relatively resistant to UV irradiation. Despite the survival of residual SARS-CoV, the UV irradiation achieved more than 5 log reduction of SARS-CoV (3.8 x 10 7 to 1.8 x 10 2 ). Therefore, UV irradiation still considered as an effective approach for decontamination of coronavirus.",
