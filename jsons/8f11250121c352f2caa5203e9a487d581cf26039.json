Extrinsic factors, such as airway infections, increased air pollution, and intrinsic factors, such as increased oxidative stress and altered immunity may contribute to this increase. The evidence for this and the potential mechanisms by which various aetiological agents increase inflammation during COPD exacerbations is reviewed. The pathophysiologic consequences of increased airway inflammation during COPD exacerbations are also discussed. This review aims to establish a cause and effect relationship between etiological factors of increased airway inflammation and COPD exacerbations based on recently published data. Although it can be speculated that reducing inflammation may prevent and/or treat COPD exacerbations, the existing anti-inflammatory treatments are modestly effective.",

The surface of bacteria allows the complement system to be activated through the alternative pathway, while specific surface molecules of the bacteria, called Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), bind to pattern recognition receptors on a variety of leukocytes and initiate signalling pathways that lead to the activation of NF-\u03baB and production of proinflammatory cytokines [17] . Once activated, innate immunity can trigger both cell-mediated and antibodymediated adaptive immune responses. This cascade of events leads to increased blood flow to tissue, increased temperature, redness and swelling which characterize inflammation.",

Increased TNF-alpha, as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels have been specifically related with H. Influenzae infection, as shown by Bresser et al [19] . However, in that study all mediators were measured in frozen sputum and MPO and IL-8 levels were only retrospectively compared to non-infected patients. In fresh sputum samples from COPD patients R. Stockley and his group demonstrated that MPO, neutrophil elastase (NE) activity, IL-8 and LTB4 levels are positively related to sputum bacterial load [20] . Moreover, the type of organism affected sputum MPO levels and NE activity; MPO levels were relatively increased in the presence of Ps. Aeruginosa compared to H. Influenzae and to M. Catarrhalis. There have been also reports for decreased secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) in sputum samples from COPD patients colonised with bacteria [20, 21] . Upper airways inflammation in COPD is also increased when there is bacterial colonization [22] . All these results taken together suggest that bacteria are [24] . This discrepancy may be due to differences in sputum induction time or in sputum processing or in the assays used for the detection of fluid-phase mediators. Another intriguing hypothesis is that different strains of the same pathogens may induce different levels of inflammation and subjects taking part in different studies might have been infected by different strains of H. Influenzae. It was recently shown that H. Influenzae strains isolated from COPD patients during exacerbation induce more inflammation than strains of the same pathogen isolated from colonizers [16] . The close association between airway infections and increased inflammation during COPD exacerbations has been further confirmed by a report of increased systemic inflammation in infected patients during exacerbation [25] .",

Inflammatory cells can release potentially harmful mediators, such as proteases and reactive oxygen species [83] . Neutrophil and eosinophil products, like MPO, NE and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP), have been found increased on exacerbations, and can cause inflammatory damage and increased permeability of the bronchial mucosa, resulting in airway oedema and protein exudation [20, 42, 62, 84] . Inflammatory mediators, like ECP, can also induce bronchoconstriction by increasing achetinocholine release from parasynmpathetic nerves, while others, like NE, increase mucus secretion [85, 86] . Furthermore, mediators of inflammation enhance coughing [87] . Potentially harmful mediators may be released not only by inflammatory cells but also by resident cells. For example, endothelin (ET)-1, which has been found increased on exacerbations, can be released by epithelial cells and stimulates mucus secretion and bronchial hyperesponsiveness [50] . The cascade of the above events leads to significant airway narrowing and increased airway secretions, while the patient suffers from increased cough, sputum, and/or increased dyspnea. The mechanisms of dyspnea are not entirely understood yet, but may be also associated with excessive airway narrowing and dynamic hyperinflation due to increased inflammation [88] [89] [90] .",

Considering that inflammation in stable COPD is steroid resistant, this should not come as a great surprise [98] . Although the majority of COPD patients respond modestly to steroid therapy, there might be subgroup of patients, those with eosinophilic pattern of inflammation during exacerbations that may benefit the most from steroid administration. There is already evidence that stable patients with high sputum eosinophil counts are steroid responsive, but there is no relevant data on COPD exacerbations [99, 100] .
