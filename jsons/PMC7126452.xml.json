Pseudoknotted RNA structures are among the simplest of RNA folding motifs. An RNA pseudoknot is minimally comprised of two helical structures connected by two single-stranded loops, thereby providing a simple way in which a single-strand of RNA can fold back on itself (Figure 1(a)). As such, RNA pseudoknots are widely recognized to play diverse fundamental roles in structurally organizing complex RNAs, in the assembly of ribonucleoprotein complexes, and in translational regulation and recoding when present within messenger RNAs (for a review, see Gesteland & Atkins, 1996).",

Similar pseudoknots have also been found in related positive-strand plant RNA viruses, including brome mosaic virus and tobacco mosaic virus (Hall, 1979). These tRNA-like structures are substrates for specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and must be aminoacylated for viral replication and propagation in plant cells (Dreher et al., 1996). Pseudoknotted RNA structures have since been identified in virtually all types of naturally occurring RNAs, including ribosomal RNAs (Powers & Noller, 1991), messenger RNAs McPheeters et al 1988, Jacks et al 1987, Jacks et al 1988a, Jacks et al 1988b, Wills et al 1991, Feng et al 1992, transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA) (Nameki et al., 1999), catalytic and self-splicing RNAs Hass et al 1994, Jabri et al 1997, Ferre-D\u2019Amare et al 1998, RNA components of ribonucleoprotein complexes, e.g. telomerase (Gilley & Blackburn, 1999), and in viral genomic RNAs (for a review, see ten Dam et al., 1992).",

Pseudoknots can possess many distinct folding topologies; however, the majority of pseudoknots that have been described to date, including the paradigm plant viral RNAs, are of the so-called H-type (Hairpin) topology in which nucleotides from a hairpin loop base-pair with single-stranded regions outside of the hairpin. This topology represents the simplest way to form a pseudoknotted structure, featuring two stem regions (S1 and S2) and two connecting loops (designated L1 and L2) (Figure 1(a)). The two helical stems of S1 and S2 base-pairs combine to form a quasi-continuous RNA double helical structure of S1 + S2 base-pairs (Pleij et al., 1985)\n(Figure 1(b)), containing one continuous and one discontinuous complementary strand. The non-equivalent single-stranded loops (L1 and L2) cross the major and minor grooves of stem S2 and stem S1, respectively (Figure 1(b)).",

Much of this structural diversity derived from differences in the helix-helix junction, defined by the extent to which the two stems are coaxially stacked on one another, the degree of under- or over-rotation at the base-pair step at the helical junction relative to A-form helical geometry, the presence or absence of intervening nucleotides on the continuous strand, and the interhelical angle between the S1 and S2 stems (Figure 1(c)). As is readily apparent upon inspection of simple cylinder model representations of pseudoknots (Figure 1(c)), even small differences in the structure of the helical junction will significantly affect the global conformation of the molecule, how each of the two loops are arranged on the surface of the molecule, how these loops interact with the helical stems, as well as define where the single-stranded RNA enters and exits this motif.",

            "text": "In addition to structural roles in the folding of complex RNAs, RNA pseudoknots also play a variety of regulatory roles in protein synthesis. In translation initiation, a pseudoknot is sometimes positioned in the non-protein coding leader sequence or overlapping the ribosome binding site and/or initiation codon of the messenger RNAs (cf. Tang and Draper 1989, McPheeters et al 1988, Gluick and Draper 1994, Ehresmann et al 1995). Here, they modulate the specific binding of proteins to their cognate mRNAs, thereby regulating or autoregulating the expression of the downstream gene. RNA pseudoknots can also be present within the coding regions of mRNAs, where they stimulate programmed \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting, an essential mechanism employed by viruses, DNA insertion sequences, yeast, and bacteria to tightly regulate the relative expression levels of protein products present in two overlapping translational reading frames (for reviews, see Gesteland and Atkins 1996, Farabaugh 1996). In addition, pseudoknots have been shown to stimulate translational readthrough by amber codon suppression (Wills et al., 1991). This review focuses on the structural and functional diversity of these RNA pseudoknots which affect translation.",

            "text": "In the vast majority of retroviral mRNAs, overlapping ORFs encode the gag gene (for viral structural proteins), the pro gene (which encodes the viral protease), and the pol gene (pol encodes the replicative enzymes of the virus including integrase and reverse transcriptase) or a pro/pol gene depending on the virus. Since translational initiation signals which could be used to synthesize the Pol and/or Pro proteins are not present in the genomic mRNA, these retroviruses employ \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting to create Gag-Pol or Gag-Pro-Pol fusion proteins from a single gag-pol (or gag-pro-pol) translational unit (Figure 2(a))\n(Jacks et al., 1987). At some intrinsic frequency (1 to 50 %), the translating ribosome shifts into the \u22121 reading frame at a heptanucleotide sequence conforming to the general sequence X XXY YYZ (termed the slippery sequence) in the gag-pol (or gag-pro) overlapping region (for reviews, see Jacks 1990, Atkins et al 1990, Hatfield and Oroszlan 1990). The simultaneous-slippage model for \u22121 ribosomal frameshifting, first proposed by Jacks et al. (1988a) in their studies of the Rous sarcoma virus gag-pro region, is consistent with many experiments and explains the nucleotide sequence determinants of the slippery sequence at the frameshift site (Figure 2(b)). The model proposes that each of the two ribosome-bound tRNAs (the peptidyl- and aminoacyl-tRNAs bound in the P and A sites, respectively) slip backwards in the 5\u2032 direction simultaneously from their initial positions in the zero frame (XXY YYZ) to the \u22121 frame (XXX YYY) and that frameshifting occurs only when each tRNA maintains at least two codon-anticodon base-pairs with the mRNA in the \u22121 shifted frame. A variety of slippery sequences are utilized by viruses with some intrinsically more efficient than others (Brierley et al., 1992), but G- and C-rich codons are not functional in the YYY position, due perhaps to the fact that these tRNA-mRNA contacts would be too stable to break during tRNA slippage. Replication competence, viral propagation, and viability of HIV-1 and the yeast double-stranded RNA virus L-A absolutely require that the pol gene be translated at a precise ratio relative to the gag gene Dinman 1995, Hung et al 1998. This observation, in turn, has motivated attempts to find small molecules which can modulate the efficiency of the frameshifting process and therefore act as antiviral agents Hung et al 1998, Dinman et al 1998, as well as identify endogenous protein factors which modulate frameshifting efficiency in vivo\n(Cui et al., 1998). In the retroviruses which do not utilize frameshifting to express the pol gene products, e.g. type-C retroviruses such as Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV), the elongating ribosome \u201creads through\u201d an in-frame amber stop codon separating gag and pol genes some fraction of the time (\u224810 %) to express the Gag-Pol fusion protein required for assembly and replication Wills et al 1991, Feng et al 1992.",

The existence of these pseudoknots and their essential involvement in ribosomal frameshifting or read-through events have been confirmed by mutagenesis studies in a number of viruses, including the coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) Brierley et al 1989, Brierley et al 1991; animal retroviruses including RSV Jacks et al 1988a, Jacks et al 1988b, mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) (Chamorro et al., 1992), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) (Morikawa & Bishop, 1992), simian retrovirus type-1 (SRV-1) (ten Dam et al., 1994), and MuLV Wills et al 1991, Feng et al 1992; double-stranded RNA viruses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, L-A and L-1 Dinman et al 1991, Tzeng et al 1992; and in plant luteoviruses and enamoviruses, including beet western yellows virus (Garcia et al., 1993; Miller et al., 1996; Kim et al., 1999). A prominent exception to this general rule is in HIV-1, where a simple 3\u2032 hairpin appears to stimulate -1 frameshifting at the gag-pol junction (Parkin et al., 1992), but only 3 to 5-fold above that obtained for this rather efficient slippery sequence (U UUU UUA) alone Jacks et al 1988b, Bidou et al 1997. In addition, other more complex folded structures or multiple molecular determinants are known or predicted to function as modest stimulators of \u22121 frameshifting in other natural contexts (cf. Rettberg et al., 1999).",

            "text": "The precise mechanism by which downstream RNA pseudoknots stimulate frameshifting or amber stop codon suppression is unknown. Recent structural studies of intact ribosome-tRNA-mRNA complexes as well as individual ribosomal subunits, coupled with extensive biochemical data, serve to provide some structural insight here Clemons et al 1999, Ban et al 1999, Cate et al 1999. Biochemical and modeling experiments suggest that docking the bipartite frameshifting signal of the gag-pro junction of MMTV into the ribosome can be accommodated in such a way that the folded pseudoknot is not necessarily engulfed or unfolded by the ribosome while maintaining base-pairing of the mRNA slippery sequence to the A- and P-site RNAs in the zero or \u22121 frames. Instead, the folded pseudoknot may be able to come into very close proximity to the ribosome itself, while maintaining base-pairing of the slippery sequence to the transfer RNAs in the peptidyl transferase center (Figure 3). This simple modeling exercise provides an immediate explanation as to why decreasing or increasing the spacer length between the slippery sequence (or amber codon) and the pseudoknot usually greatly decreases recoding efficiency. In either case, the slippery sequence would no longer be optimally positioned in the active site of the ribosome, and the way in which the ribosome \u201cinteracts\u201d with the pseudoknot would be altered. The importance of nucleotide sequence in this connecting region has only been tested extensively in the MuLV read-through site, where the identities of some nucleotides were found to be more important than others (Wills et al., 1994). In addition, the topological constraints of the classic pseudoknot fold, in which the 5\u2032 (closest to an approaching ribosome) and 3\u2032 structural boundaries of the pseudoknot are on opposite ends of the molecule, when compared to a standard hairpin, must also be important Draper 1990, ten Dam et al 1992. In fact, replacement of the pseudoknot in the IBV frameshifting site with an RNA hairpin conforming to the S1 + S2 base-pairs of the pseudoknot greatly diminishes frameshifting efficiency (Somogyi et al., 1993).",

Consistent with this, some peptidyl transferase inhibitors have been shown to specifically alter the efficiencies of \u22121 frameshifting (Dinman et al., 1997). At least one of these (sparsomycin) would be expected to increase the amount of time the ribosome remains stalled over the slippery sequence and has been shown to strongly increase frameshifting efficiency (Dinman et al., 1997). However, the degree of frameshifting may only be partially correlated with the extent of ribosomal pausing on the slippery sequence since RNA stem-loops also induce ribosomes to pause, albeit at reduced levels (Somogyi et al., 1993), suggesting that ribosomal pausing is necessary but not sufficient to promote efficient frameshifting.",

A further complication is that absolute determinations of frameshifting efficiency for the same site have been shown to differ between in vitro translation systems versus in vivo\nGarcia et al 1993, Brierley 1995, Grentzmann et al 1998, with in vivo efficiencies in eukaryotic cells generally lower (cf. Kim et al., 1999). This makes comparisons of functional data from laboratory to laboratory and from site to site difficult. Nonetheless, most retroviral and coronoviral frameshift sites are characterized by frameshifting efficiencies which typically range from \u224815 to 40 %. In all cases, the presence of the slippery heptanucleotide sequence alone stimulates frameshifting, often up to 1 % or so in some cases, considerably greater than the extremely low level of error frameshifting on random sequence mRNA which is on the order of 0.01 % (Kurland, 1992). Thus, while some pseudoknots are intrinsically able to stimulate higher levels of frameshifting than others, all represent only a subtle modulation of a process which occurs to a significant extent in the absence of a downstream stimulatory element.",

This review will summarize the significant progress made in the last several years in determining the structure, stability, dynamics and functional efficacy of wild-type and variant mRNA sites and how these findings might be combined to develop a mechanistic framework for understanding ribosomal frameshifting.

Specifically predicted were the presence of a stem S2 of six or seven base-pairs crossed by a short single-nucleotide loop L1, with more variability in the lengths of stem S1 and loop L2. Consistent with this hypothesis, it was subsequently shown that a stem S2 of six base-pairs, but not five or eight base-pairs, was fully compatible with a single-nucleotide L1 pseudoknotted conformation (Du & Hoffman, 1997), as originally predicted by Pleij et al. (1985). If one allows for an expansion of loop L1 from one to two nucleotides within this general motif (Theimer et al., 1998), this hypothesis is consistent with structural analyses of a number of frameshifting Brierley et al 1991, Chamorro et al 1992, ten Dam et al 1995 and read-through Alam et al 1999a, Alam et al 1999b RNA pseudoknots, and suggests that significant structural and/or functional features are encoded in this motif.

            "text": "The MMTV gag-pro frameshifting pseudoknot has a five base-pair stem S1 with a relatively short loop L2 (eight nucleotides) and is characterized by an unpaired adenosine wedged between the two helical stems. Stem S2 has six base-pairs and is crossed by a two-nucleotide loop L2 (Figure 4). The MMTV pseudoknot and structural variants have been subjected to mutational analysis and structure probing Chamorro et al 1992, Chen et al 1995 and the solution structure of MMTV-vpk has been solved by NMR spectroscopy (Shen & Tinoco, 1995)\n(Figure 4). Although a refined NMR solution structure of the MMTV pseudoknot contains additional loop-to-stem constraints for loop L1 due to the presence of a coordinated Co(NH3)6\n3+ ion, the precise conformation of the nucleotides in loop L1 remain undefined, as do nucleotides in loop L2 (Gonzalez & Tinoco, 1999). The motional dynamics of nucleotides in loop L2 are distinct from the rest of the molecule, and might be characterized by rapid internal motion. The unpaired adenosine at the helical junction (A14) appears to induce a pronounced \u224860 \u00b0 bend angle between helices; in RNAs in which this adenosine is deleted (Figure 4), the helical stems are reported to be coaxially stacked as determined by NMR spectroscopy. Since standard NMR spectroscopy is not a particularly good method to precisely define the global conformation of a extended RNA helical molecule Dallas and Moore 1997, Holland et al 1999, the MMTV structure is likely compatible with a range of interhelical angles. Nonetheless, mutational studies in this system suggest that frameshifting and non-frameshifting variants appear to differ primarily by the presence or absence of the wedged adenosine Chamorro et al 1992, Chen et al 1996, Kang et al 1996, Kang and Tinoco 1997 consistent with the hypothesis that frameshifting efficiency at the MMTV gag-pro site derives at least in part, from a specific bent conformation of the pseudoknot.",

It was shown that the identity and number of nucleotides in the loops were largely unimportant, provided that a minimum number of nucleotides were present so that the basic structure of the pseudoknot was maintained (Pleij et al., 1985). For example, the single adenosine in loop L1 could be replaced with any other nucleotide or the loop enlarged by one nucleotide with little discernable effect on frameshifting efficacy (ten Dam et al., 1995). Interestingly, within the context of the native stem S1, ten Dam et al. (1995) identified a rough correlation between the stability of stem S2 and frameshifting efficiency. A similar correlation was not found when compensatory mutations were introduced into the SRV-1 stem S1, although the interpretation of these experiments is complicated by the fact that a guanosine-rich 5\u2032 arm of stem S1 appears to be important for function (cf. Napthine et al 1999, ten Dam et al 1995). These results lead the authors to propose that a certain threshold stability of the proximal stem S1 was required to fix the ribosome positioned at or over the slippery sequence, and provided this was maintained, the approaching ribosome might then \u201csense\u201d the stability of the distal stem S2.",

The frameshifting pseudoknots from the gag-pro junction in SRV-1 and the gag-pro junction in feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) each have the potential to form either an A-U base-pair or an unpaired adenosine at the helical junction Chen et al 1996, Morikawa and Bishop 1992, i.e. the nucleotide sequence suggests that there is structural ambiguity at the junction (Figure 4). NMR evidence suggests that the closing A-U base-pair at the helical junction in SRV-1 is formed (Du et al., 1997) but is characterized by a significantly faster base-pair opening frequency than are other stem base-pairs. Subsequent mutational analyses suggested that the identity of these two nucleotides and their ability to base-pair have no affect on frameshifting efficiency in SRV-1 or FIV Chen et al 1996, Sung and Kang 1998. In the case of the SRV-1 gag-pro pseudoknot and its variants, the structure of the helical junction may well be dynamic and perhaps not easily defined in terms of a single conformation at equilibrium.",

(1999) recently systematically investigated the influence of the length of stem S1 on functional activity since this seemed to be the primary structural difference between the IBV and retroviral gag-pro mRNA molecules. The remarkable finding from these studies was that a minimal stem S1 length of 11 to 12 base-pairs was found to be absolutely required for high-level frameshifting in vitro (48 %); a stem S1 length of ten base-pairs was only poorly effective (7 %), and shorter stem S1 constructs even less so. Increasing the length of loop L2 in the context of a ten base-pair stem S1 construct did not increase the efficiency of frameshifting, as would be expected if the reduced activity of the ten base-pair S1 RNA was not a trivial consequence of a loop L2 which was too short to span stem S1. Why an 11 or 12 base-pair stem is required in this context is unknown, although it may be significant that this corresponds to essentially one turn of A-form helix. This hints at a topological requirement for frameshifting, rather than one based on simple stability and structural determinants. Notably, pseudoknots containing the same number of base-pairs in stem S1 (11 base-pairs), but predicted to differ by over 8 kcal mol\u22121 in \u0394G\u00b037 due to differences in base-pair composition, were found to give rise to uniformly high levels of frameshifting (\u2a7e45 %) characteristic of this system (Napthine et al., 1999). Systematic studies on the impact that changes in the predicted stability of stem S2 and frameshifting efficiency, like those reported for the SRV-1 gag-pro pseudoknot ten Dam et al 1994, ten Dam et al 1995 have not yet been reported for IBV.",

This suggests that the junction is coaxially stacked like that in the T2 molecule (Figure 1(b)) and is structurally distinct from the helical junction in MMTV. In addition, the base-pair composition at the top of stem S1, closest to the slippery site, appeared to influence frameshifting efficiency, with a run of four guanines on the 5\u2032 strand optimal for frameshifting; a similar requirement has been observed in SRV-1 (ten Dam et al., 1995).

(1999) propose that the MMTV gag-pro frameshifting pseudoknot may be largely representative of frameshift enhancers which maintain a shorter stem S1 and loop L2, coupled with similar stem S2 and loop L1 features. In a clever series of experiments, Liphardt et al. (1999) started with an inactive IBV-like pseudoknot with six base-pairs in each stem and a loop L2 of 8 nucleotides and asked what minimal structural features were required to confer functional activity on this inactive pseudoknot. It was found that an intercalated adenosine derived from the continuous strand had to be present at the junction of the two helical stems, like that found in the MMTV site, and that the 3\u2032 nucleotide in loop L2 closest to the junction had to be an adenosine base (A29). These structural features are embodied in the pKA-A pseudoknot shown in Figure 4. Furthermore, compensatory base-pair substitutions in two base-pairs near the helical junction in stem S1 (C4-G18 and G5-C17) revealed that the requirement for A29 was manifest only when these two base-pairs were maintained; i.e. flipped G4-C18 and C5-G17 base-pair substitutions led to a fourfold loss in frameshifting efficiency and bypassed the requirement for A29 in loop L2. This was taken as functional evidence for a key loop L2-stem S1 interaction, much like that observed in the NMR structure of the TYMV pseudoknot (Kolk et al., 1998). Surprisingly, the functional requirement for this interaction could be largely bypassed if the length of loop L2 was significantly increased (to 13 nt). Consistent with these findings, the SRV-1 gag-pro pseudoknot, which has a longer loop L2 than MMTV (11 or 12 versus eight nucleotides) and a uridine-rich rather than adenosine-rich 3\u2032 end of loop L2 (Figure 4), does not show this functional requirement.",

The combination of the G GGA AAC slippery sequence and the pseudoknot found six nucleotides downstream is sufficient to induce ribosomes to simultaneously slip into the \u22121 frame about 1 to 4 % of the time Garcia et al 1993, Kim et al 1999. The 1.6 \u00c5 crystal structure of a 28 nucleotide RNA encompassing the proposed minimal structure of the pseudoknot reveals some remarkable structural features (Figure 5)\n(Su et al., 1999). As found in the MMTV gag-pro pseudoknot, the helical stems are not coaxially stacked. However, in contrast to MMTV, this is largely due to a 48 \u00b0 rotation between the top base of stem S2 (A25) and G7 in stem S1 which results in a \u22485 \u00c5 helical displacement of the two stems relative to one another, with U13, the potential base-pairing partner of A25 at the helical junction, extruded from the helix (Figure 5(b)). The base-pairs in stem S2 are considerably distorted from A-form helical geometry, perhaps to accommodate the short loop L1 in this context (Pleij et al., 1985) and the interhelical angle is \u224825 \u00b0. There is a clear base-triple (or base quadruple) interaction between C8 from loop L1 and the G12\u2013G26 base-pair (A25 may also be involved in further stabilizing this unusual loop-stem interaction) (Figure 5). Another remarkable feature of the structure is a novel adenosine-rich RNA triplex, in which loop L2 snakes down the minor groove of stem S1, forming a series of non-canonical hydrogen bonding interactions involving the 2\u2032-OH, N1, N3 and N7 of A20, as well as N1 and N6 of A24 (Su et al., 1999). The sequence of loop L2 in related plant luteoviral pseudoknots is strongly conserved with adenosines at the 3\u2032 end of the loop (Miller et al., 1995).",

An extensive mutational analysis of the BWYV pseudoknot reveals that this is largely the case, with a few unanticipated results (Kim et al., 1999). For example, the identity of loop L1 C8 and much of the minor groove triplex was found to be essential for maintaining high levels of frameshifting activity. The effects of these and other mutations which diminished frameshifting efficiency were generally readily rationalized on the basis of a lower predicted stability of the mutant pseudoknots. There was, however, one prominent exception. A series of mutants which contained a single nucleotide insertion at the 5\u2032 end of loop L2, the region which connects stem S1 and the loop L2 nucleotides, increased frameshifting efficiencies by up to 3-fold of the wild-type level (Kim et al., 1999). Why this is the case is unknown, but may derive from an increased stability, through the reduction of the entropic loop closing penalty (Gultyaev et al., 1999), or through favorable interactions with the ribosome (cf. Figure 3). In any case, these findings, which document the functional importance of the identity of loop nucleotides in the BWYV pseudoknot, contrast sharply with previous mutational studies on SRV-1 and IBV where loop L2 sequence substitutions were found to have no significant functional affect Brierley et al 1991, ten Dam et al 1994.",

As a result, the pseudoknotted conformation sequesters slightly more counterions per phosphate at lower metal ion concentrations relative to the partially folded forms of the molecule. This sequestration likely arises from patches of relatively larger negative electrostatic surface potential; recent success in calculating such surfaces has been obtained through numerical solutions of the nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann equation (Chin et al., 1999). In RNA pseudoknots, these regions might be present at or near the helix-helix junction, where the two loops of the pseudoknot exit and rejoin the duplex regions of the molecule. While these site(s) are of intermediate affinity and bind only weakly localized ions, it is sometimes possible to structurally define these sites in solution using trivalent Co(NH3)6\n3+ ions and NMR spectroscopy. Gonzales & Tinoco (1999) successfully identified a binding site for Co(NH3)6\n3+ in the major groove, near the base of stem S2, in an ion binding pocket formed by the two nucleotide loop L1 and the major groove of stem S2 of the MMTV-vpk pseudoknot (cf. Figure 4); this \u201csite\u201d was predicted by Brownian motion molecular dynamics simulations (Hermann & Westhof, 1998). Interestingly, a Co(NH3)6\n3+ ion(s) also appears localized near the loop L1-stem S2 region in the T2 and T4 gene 32 mRNA pseudoknots as well (Nixon et al., 1999).",

With one striking exception (the BWYV pseudoknot, discussed below), this occurs to such a degree that if other pseudoknot loop-stem interactions do form in aqueous solution, they appear to contribute minimally to the net enthalpy term of the stability. The simple prediction from these findings is that in many cases, pseudoknot loops would function only as connecting linkers, substitution of which would be energetically silent. Although the data are limited Theimer et al 1998, Theimer and Giedroc 1999 this is often found not to be the case, revealing that substitutions of loop nucleotides perturb the energetics of loop closure in pseudoknots in a way that is not fully understood. The molecular origin of these perturbations are not known and may have to do with subtle differences in the energetics of the unfolded state, but are often quite significant and can even dictate whether or not the pseudoknotted conformation will be the major conformer at equilibrium at 37 \u00b0C Theimer et al 1998, Theimer and Giedroc 1999.",

The BYWV pseudoknot is characterized a strongly pH-dependent tertiary structural folding, which contributes at pH 6.0 \u224830 kcal mol\u22121 in unfolding enthalpy (Table 1) and nearly 4 kcal mol\u22121 in stability beyond that which can be attributed to secondary structure alone (Nixon & Giedroc, 2000). Characterization of wild-type and mutant RNAs as a function of pH suggests that protonation of N3 of C8 in loop L1, to form a third hydrogen bond to the G12-C26 base-pair of stem S2, is solely responsible for the pH-dependence (cf. Figure 5). Disruption of the base-triple interaction by nucleotide substitution reduces the stability of the tertiary structure to that of the wild-type RNA at pH 8, provided a native loop L2 is present. Loop-stem interactions are absolutely required to stabilize the pseudoknotted conformation in the BWYV pseudoknot; this is very likely a consequence of the low intrinsic stability of stem S2, which does not benefit from strong helix-helix stacking with stem S1. Functional studies reveal that the native C8+\u00b7G12-C26 base-triple interaction is absolutely required to stimulate frameshifting (Kim et al., 1999).",

            "text": "From work on model systems, it was anticipated that coaxial stacking of the two helices in simple RNA pseudoknots might provide a major stability determinant for these molecules. In a model duplex system which recapitulates the primary sequence determinants of helix-helix stacking in RNA, it was found that the free energy increment for base stacking at a coaxial helix junction consisting of one continuous and one non-continuous RNA strand like that found in a pseudoknot was more stabilizing (by \u22481 kcal mol\u22121 at 37 \u00b0C) than was the same base stack in a continuous helix Walter et al 1994, Walter and Turner 1994. It was therefore surprising that studies of wild-type and variant T4 gene 32 mRNA pseudoknots revealed that compensatory base-pairing mutations introduced into the helical junction were not as destabilizing or stabilizing as predicted on the basis of these model studies (Theimer et al., 1998). In fact, unfolding of the wild-type T2 gene 32 pseudoknot appears to initiate at the junction stack itself, identifying this region as the weakest point in the molecule (Nixon & Giedroc, 1998). NMR structural studies provide a possible explanation for this (Holland et al., 1999). They reveal that the base-pair step at the helical junction at low salt is over-rotated by \u224818 \u00b0 in order to remove close approach of phosphate groups in this region; this reduces base-pair stacking at the junction, which would substantially weaken the interface. Consistent with this, recent solvent exchange studies of the T2 pseudoknot reveal that the A15-U28 base-pair (cf. Figure 1) is characterized by a substantially increased base-pair opening frequency relative to other base-pairs of the molecule (J. Lillemoen & D. Hoffman, unpublished results); the same was found for the SRV-1 gag-pro pseudoknot (Du et al., 1997). A weakly base-paired interhelical junction is also consistent with studies which show that the global stability of the helical junction region can be strongly modulated by the nature and number of nucleotides in each of the two loops Theimer et al 1998, Theimer and Giedroc 1999. In addition, in at least one case, the presence of a 3\u2032 dangling single-stranded nucleotide stacked at the base of stem S2 can strongly stabilize the junction region through non-nearest neighbor effects apparently transmitted through the single-nucleotide loop L1 in the T4 gene 32 mRNA pseudoknot (Theimer et al., 1998).",

This free energy increment, while significant, is comparable to expectations for a single-stranded adenosine stack on a helical terminus but less than that which would be expected for a strongly coaxially stacked junction. A thermodynamic analysis of the folding of the closely evolutionarily related gag-pro frameshifting pseudoknot from mouse intracisternal A-type particles (mIAP) reveals that the deletion of the analogous adenosine is also destabilizing by \u22480.5 to 1 kcal mol\u22121 (37 \u00b0C) (Theimer & Giedroc, 1999). Functional studies reveal that this deletion reduces frameshifting efficiencies by ten-fold, analogous to previous studies of MMTV gag-pro and MMTV-IBV chimeric pseudoknots (E. Sulistijo, C. Theimer & D. Giedroc, unpublished observations).",

Further, in at least one case, the hairpin has been shown to reduce the degree of ribosomal pausing relative to a pseudoknot containing the same number of base-pairs (by about fivefold) (Somogyi et al., 1993). Thus, as previously suggested by Dinman et al., (1997), it seems reasonable to propose that increasing the amount of time the ribosome remains stalled over the slippery sequence will increase the likelihood that the ribosome will shift backward, irrespective of the actual mechanism. If one further accepts the idea that any unique stabilizing, structural and/or topological features of the pseudoknot are lost upon unfolding to a hairpin intermediate, and that partial unfolding is rate-limiting for frameshifting, it follows that the rate at which the pseudoknot is unfolded to the hairpin intermediate might be tightly tied to the efficiency of recoding.",

However, in order for the ribosome to pass through this structure, at least two mutually exclusive, partially folded pseudoknot folding intermediates could potentially be transiently formed. These are the stem S1 and stem S2 hairpins (Figure 6(b)). Formation of the stem S1 hairpin intermediate requires that the distal stem S2 is denatured first. This might occur through a physical interaction of the paused ribosome with the proximal stem S1 and loop L2, which destabilizes the helical junction and the distal stem S2, resulting in S2 helix unwinding. This in turn removes the topological constraint imposed by the pseudoknot, leaving a partially folded S1 hairpin, which following frameshifting, is denatured and decoded in the normal fashion by the ribosome. This unfolding model predicts that the S1 stem is of a stability appropriate to function as a physical block or a pause determinant (Somogyi et al., 1993) and could occur with or without partial unwinding of stem S1.",

It makes the prediction that frameshifting efficiency will be tightly correlated with the stability of the weakest part of the molecule, e.g. stem S2 in the SRV-1 gag-pro site (ten Dam et al., 1995) or the helical junction in other retroviral frameshifters. It also predicts that there would be no correlation with the stability of stem S1, as already determined in several systems Napthine et al 1999, ten Dam et al 1995. Furthermore, this scenario readily accommodates findings which reveal that, at least in some cases, the pseudoknot loops function as strong thermodynamic coupling agents: mutations in loop L2 of mIAP gag-pro induce a long-range destabilization of stem S2, or more generally the weakest structural determinant in the molecule (Theimer & Giedroc, 1999). This recoding model may well characterize frameshifting pseudoknots that contain a relatively short stem S1, e.g. the luteoviral and retroviral gag-pro pseudoknots, and predicts that destabilization of the helical junction region may have a large impact on frameshifting efficiencies, as has been observed Liphardt et al 1999, Kim et al 1999.",

Moving the distal stem S2 far from the ribosome would satisfy either criterion, within limits. This could be accomplished by lengthening stem S1 to a full turn of helix like that which appears to be critical for maintaining high efficiency frameshifting in IBV (Napthine et al., 1999). Furthermore, weak coupling of the distal stem S2 and loop L2 to the rest of the pseudoknot could potentially accommodate considerable structural complexity within loop L2 with essentially no effect on frameshifting efficiency, as has been found in IBV and related coronoviruses (Brierley, 1995).

There is virtually no support for or against this model, since experiments along these lines have yet to be carried out. However, pseudoknots differing in the presence of even a small number of loop-stem interactions at the helical junction versus a helical junction with significant flexibility might be expected to subtly differ in their rates of unfolding, in the absence of large, measurable differences in free energies of the folded versus the partially folded intermediates. In this scenario, the efficiency of frameshifting would be kinetically, rather than thermodynamically, controlled. A reaction coordinate diagram which illustrates this idea is shown in Figure 7(b).",

Indeed, this is nearly the extent to which the IBV-MMTV chimeric pKA-A and pKA-G pseudoknots differ in their frameshifting efficiencies (cf. Figure 4) (Liphardt et al., 1999). The disruption of a favorable interaction involving A29 in pKA-A by substitution with G29 in pKA-G might make the helical junction more dynamically mobile, thereby lowering the transition state energy barrier for stem-loop unfolding.",

Clearly, additional high resolution structural studies of evolutionary diverse frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots, such as the minimal IBV sequence, would lend evidence for or against the hypothesis that clearly dissimilar structural motifs are capable of stimulating high levels of frameshifting. Structural studies should be complemented by systematic thermodynamic and kinetic analyses, to probe for correlations between stability, unfolding pathway and functional activity. Detailed studies of the base and backbone-specific motional dynamics of the helical junction regions in similar molecules using NMR approaches in partially oriented samples (Hansen et al., 1998), heteronuclear NMR relaxation experiments (Akke et al., 1997) and steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques (Eis & Millar, 1993) are likely to shed significant molecular insight into the nature of the helix-helix junction, as well as the structure and dynamics of the globular conformation of the molecule, and how this might differ between functional and weakly functional pseudoknots.",

In addition, the future identification and characterization of an 80S ribosome-associated RNA helicase(s), and how the rate of helix unwinding and substrate specificity differs for pseudoknotted versus hairpin-like RNA substrates is a particularly critical area for future investigation. Further biochemical characterization of maintenance-of-frame (mof) mutants already isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae which modulate the degree of frameshifting in ScV/L-A will also surely be informative with regard to cellular factors might be influencing this process (Dinman & Wickner, 1994).
