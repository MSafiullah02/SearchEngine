They also account for the majority of antibiotic prescriptions, particularly in children, in spite of the fact that most of the infections will resolve on their own without medical intervention. The specific diagnosis of bacterial versus viral infection cannot conclusively be made on clinical examination alone and, as the symptoms overlap significantly, the physician may order diagnostic tests and empirically prescribe antibiotics (Xu et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Traditionally, the laboratory diagnosis of respiratory infections has been a lengthy procedure, using bacterial and viral culture or relatively insensitive techniques such as immunofluorescence (IFA) and rapid enzyme immune assays (EIA) (Lode, 2007; Bartlett, 2011; Kellogg, 1990; Tenover, 2011; Chartrand et al., 2012; Chartrand et al., 2015; Blasi, 2004). These test modalities can identify a limited number of organisms such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza and parainfluenza viruses, and bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. With the introduction of rapid molecular tests we now know that the list of common agents known to cause respiratory infections is much longer than previously thought and the laboratory diagnostic options to detect respiratory pathogens have improved significantly (Blasi, 2004; Jain et al., 2015; Niederman and Fein, 1986; Rea-Neto et al., 2008). Molecular tests offer many advantages including a rapid response time and the ability to detect organisms that will not grow in culture. In addition these tests allow detection of bacteria in patients where antimicrobial treatment has been initiated prior to collection of the sample. We now have access to accurate and rapid multiplex assays simultaneously detecting both viral and bacterial pathogens within a few hours. The ability to diagnose co-infections is a significant improvement as these can be associated with increased morbidity and mortality (Burk et al., 2016; Marcos et al., 2009; Rea-Neto et al., 2008). Rapid molecular tests have been shown to reduce the length of hospital stay and the cost of testing for those with viral respiratory testing and has facilitated a more targeted approach to patients presenting with respiratory infections with respect to treatment regimens, need for admission and infection control concerns (Barenfanger et al., 2000; Ljungstr\u00f6m et al., 2017; Pavia, 2011; Woo et al., 1997).",

Examples include BIOFIRE\u00ae FILMARRAY\u00ae Respiratory Panel (Biomerieux) that enables detection and identification of multiple organisms based on nested PCR and melt-curve analysis (Poritz et al., 2011). A similar test kit, in terms of workflow and pathogen targets, is ePlex\u00ae Respiratory Pathogen Panel (GenMark Dx) which makes use of signal probes and capture probes to electrochemically detect target pathogens (Genmark, 2018). Both systems fully automate nucleic acid extraction, amplification or probe hybridization and detection. Also, these tests are very easy to perform, provide faster results (<1 h) and require very little hands on time (\u223c2 min). On the other hand, xTAG\u00ae Respiratory Viral Panel (Luminex) and Resplex I&II (Qiagen) assays require nucleic acid extraction and amplification of targets prior to probe hybridization, labelling and detection by a flow cytometric method on a Luminex xMAP system (Salez et al., 2015). Multiplex, real-time PCR based kits are also available such as Fast-Track Diagnostics Respiratory pathogens 21 (FTDRP21) (Siemens Healthineers) is a five tube multiplex PCR assay to detect a total of 23 pathogen targets (Barratt et al., 2017). The test kit provides reagents only and the users can run the tests using their own nucleic acid extraction platforms and real-time PCR systems.",

            "text": "While most commercial assays are rapid and convenient and their performance characteristics meet regulatory requirements, they are invariably expensive, which may be difficult to implement in resource poor settings. Also, commercial test kits are not uniformly available throughout the world. Timely delivery of test kits and reagents are critical for smooth operation of diagnostic laboratories and a delay in shipping may adversely affect the management of patients with respiratory infections. Furthermore, commercial tests are not free of technical limitations. Some tests may be difficult to interpret due to background signals or ambiguous results from multiple targets in the same reaction. It is also difficult to troubleshoot commercial assays because of proprietary test characteristics. In addition, commercial assays cannot be quickly modified when new pathogens or new strains of known pathogens emerge which are missed by the existing assays. Therefore, in this study, we developed an in-house PCR assay panel (Respanel) customized to detect the most common, and clinically significant respiratory pathogens. The assay was designed to use pre-aliquoted assay-specific reagents in strip-tubes for convenience, and to reduce the hands-on time required to perform multiple reactions for each patient specimen. The performance characteristics of Respanel assay were compared with two commercially available assays.",

            "text": "Molecular assays for simultaneous detection of common respiratory pathogens are now widely used, replacing many conventional diagnostic methods such as culture and antigen detection assays. Implementation of these tests have resulted in increased identification of causative pathogens for acute upper and lower respiratory tract infections. In addition, a significant decrease in turn-around time (TAT) has allowed for more timely implementation of appropriate isolation precaution measures and reduced use of inappropriate antibiotics (Keske et al., 2018; Ko and Drews, 2017; Nijhuis et al., 2017; van Rijn et al., 2018). A wide range of multiplex assays are now available commercially which differ in their use of chemistry, optics and the level of automation. Many test methods have also been described in the literature for potential use as laboratory-developed tests (LDT) (Boivin et al., 2004; Feng et al., 2018; Loens et al., 2012; L\u00e9tant et al., 2007; Nijhuis et al., 2017). To make an appropriate choice, a careful assessment of performance characteristics as well as costs and benefits associated with the test method is necessary. Ideally, when performance characteristics of test methods are comparable and meet regulatory requirements, a test method and a platform that provides rapid TAT and requires minimum technical skill and hands on time would be preferable. However, the costs associated with the platform, such as test kits and service contracts may not be affordable to many laboratories. Furthermore, because the majority of these test platforms are closed systems it is difficult to troubleshoot ambiguous results and test failures in a timely manner without active and continuous support from the vendor. LDTs on the other hand necessitate more labour and responsibilities for the laboratory in order to maintain the quality of the test. Substantial molecular biology expertise and effort are also necessary for validation of LDTs. However, LDTs are less expensive and can be tailored specifically to needs of the laboratory and the patient population it serves. An additional advantage is that LDTs can be updated rapidly to make the test inclusive for a new pathogen of interest or an emerging variant of a known pathogen. Logistically, if stored properly, primers and probes used in PCR based LDTs may have a longer shelf life than the manufacturer recommended shelf life of commercial kits.",

Accordingly, we designed our workflow so that assay specific reagents are ready to be used for routine testing (Fig. 1). We also minimized repeated pipetting through the use of multichannel pipettes for faster transfer of reagents and to prevent pipetting error. An alternative to our approach is to lyophilize pre-dispensed primer and probe mix (PPM) in 96-well PCR plates, which we have not yet tested. Although this approach would reduce labour and the time required for reagent transfer with a multichannel pipette, the disadvantages include the additional labour and facility requirements for lyophilization and that the entire plate would be used up in every PCR run irrespective of the number of samples on the plate.",

First, the accuracy of results obtained by each PCR assay was compared with results obtained by bacterial or viral culture, DFA, Resplex and standard PCR assays offered by the Microbiology and Virology laboratories of BC Children\u2019s Hospital, Canada. Next test comparisons were made with Resplex and FTDRP21 assays at two different laboratories using nasopharyngeal specimens. Despite multiple test types used as reference methods, Respanel assay demonstrated 82%\u2013100% (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3) concordance with the reference methods. Respanel detected significantly more pathogens than Resplex (p = 0.015 by Student\u2019s T-test) but was not different than the FTDRP21 panel (p = 0.27 by Student\u2019s T-test) (data not shown). This is consistent with the fact that Respanel and FTDRP21 are both real-time PCR based methods, while Resplex assay employed a different chemistry based on highly multiplexed PCR, probe hybridization and flow cytometry.",
