They cause a broad spectrum of human disease, including myocarditis, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, meningoencephalitis, and paralytic myelitis (Romero, 2007). At least 68 serotypes have been defined. Periodic enterovirus outbreaks occur and are a major public health concern (Khetsuriani et al., 2006). While most enteroviral infections are not life-threatening, certain serotypes (e.g., polioviruses, enterovirus 71) can cause devastating neurological damage and death. Poliovirus outbreaks still occur in developing nations despite eradication efforts. Oral poliovirus vaccine-derived strains are an increasing cause of viral paralytic syndrome and must be differentiated from wild-type poliovirus and other causes of paralytic myelitis such as West Nile virus, coxsackievirus A7, and enterovirus 70/71 (Muir et al., 1998). Hence, the capacity to classify human enteroviruses in clinical specimens is imperative to disease prevention, treatment, and prognosis.",

            "text": "Historically, serotyping enteroviruses has been accomplished by a combination of indirect fluorescence antibody testing (IFA) and viral neutralization assays using anti-sera pools provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). These techniques are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and technically demanding. The WHO no longer produces anti-sera for viral neutralization studies, which now must be obtained from the few remaining sources such as the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM, The Netherlands). Flow cytometry is a potential alternative to IFA for serotyping clinical isolates and provides quantitative information with less inter-observer variability. With flow cytometry, hundreds of cells can be analyzed in a short period of time (seconds) with increased sensitivity to detection of fluorescence signals due to the use of lasers and photomultiplier tubes, and has the ability for automation. Despite these advantages over IFA, no studies have focused on the use of flow cytometry for serotyping enterovirus prior to this study.",

The percentages of infected cells were quantified by first gating on the forward and side scatter signals to help eliminate cell debris and non-cellular events that may be present. Negative control levels were determined using isotype control antibodies, which gave similar results to unstained cells or cells stained with antibodies directed against other (irrelevant) enterovirus serotypes. The infected cells represented those gated cellular events staining above negative control levels using virus specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1\n, coxsackievirus B1-infected cells demonstrated positive staining for pan-enterovirus, coxsackievirus B blend, and coxsackievirus B1 antibodies and were negative for isotype control, echovirus blend, enterovirus blend, poliovirus blend, and coxsackievirus B2, B3, B4, B5, and B6 antibodies. Representative data shown in Fig. 2\ndemonstrate that echovirus 9-infected cells were positive for echoblend and echovirus 9-specific antibodies and negative for echovirus 4, 6, 11, and 30 individual specific antibodies. The thresholds used in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 were based on subjective criteria in which a natural break between positive and negative cells could be illustrated, allowing for easy comparison between infected cells and negative controls. PMK cells infected with echovirus 6, echovirus 11, or echovirus 30 demonstrated positive staining for pan-enterovirus and echovirus blend antibodies and were negative for isotype control, enterovirus blend, coxsackievirus B blend, and poliovirus blend antibodies (not shown). Echovirus 30-infected cells were additionally positive for echovirus 30-specific antibody. Rhinovirus 7-infected cells stained similarly to uninoculated cells for pan-enterovirus, echovirus blend, coxsackievirus B blend, and isotype antibodies. In all cases, IFA demonstrated qualitatively similar results compared to the flow cytometry determined percentages.",

Similar results were obtained with echovirus 30, in that PMK cells with detectable antibody staining for pan-enterovirus or echovirus blend were found by flow cytometry 2 days after cells were inoculated, whereas IFA detected positive-staining cells by the same antibodies 3 days after inoculation.

            "text": "In this study, flow cytometry proved to be a sensitive method for detecting fluorescently stained enterovirus-infected cells. For both echovirus 30- and coxsackievirus B1-infected PMK cells, flow cytometry was able to detect infection 1 day before the viral infection became detectable by IFA. This is likely due to the ability of flow cytometry to quickly analyze a larger number of cells than is routinely examined by IFA. It was also able to quantitate the level of infection even when there are low numbers of virus-infected cells. The capacity to quantitate allowed for monitoring enterovirus infection in PMK cells over a 4-day period using different antibodies which gave similar results. The coxsackievirus B1 strain used in this study was highly efficient at infecting PMK cells compared to the echovirus 30 strain. As the predilection of different enterovirus serotypes and even strains within a serotype for different cells lines is well-known (She et al., 2006), it is not surprising that a different rate of infection between the two serotypes used in this study was observed. False positives did not occur by flow cytometric analysis in that infected cells were negative after staining with isotype control antibodies and antibodies directed against other enterovirus serotypes. This is not surprising as the specificity of flow cytometry in general is related to the particular antibodies employed, and therefore, should be similar to microscopy based detection methods using the same antibodies. Also, uninoculated cells did not demonstrate positive staining with any of the antibodies used. Study of additional human enterovirus serotypes using this method is warranted.",

Because highly variable regions are targeted by genotyping studies, degenerate primer sequences and/or nested designs are necessary to ensure adequate sensitivity. Use of an antibody-based method, such as flow cytometry and IFA, may have the advantage of better consistency in identifying enterovirus serotypes. Flow cytometry can also be potentially faster and less expensive than molecular methods for viral typing.",

Shell vials were used to facilitate infection of cells with centrifugation, as is commonly done in the clinical virology laboratory. It is possible that a more efficient tissue culture system could be employed, such as use of multiple well plates (e.g., 96-well plate format). In this way the need for handling numerous shell vials per specimen is obviated. Others have found the use of centrifuged multiple well plates combined with blind immunoperoxidase staining for enterovirus to be both rapid and sensitive (Bourlet et al., 1998, Terletskaia-Ladwig et al., 2008) and this method can potentially be performed using fluorescent antibody staining followed by flow cytometric analysis instead. Because the PMK cells grow as a surface monolayer, trypsinization was used to create an optimal single cell suspension (Grogan and Collins, 1990). Another potential option is the use of lymphocytic or monocytic cell lines which have been described for cultivation of a limited number of enterovirus serotypes (Okada et al., 1987, Skarsvik et al., 2006, Vuorinen et al., 1999, Vuorinen et al., 1994). Cultivation of enterovirus in such a manner would facilitate interrogation by flow cytometry and may be studied in the future. Other cell lines that are routinely used in the clinical laboratory for isolation of enterovirus, e.g., RD, MRC-5, and BGM, should also be investigated. Directly labeled antibodies are not commercially available for enteroviruses but would be useful in streamlining the protocol described. Multicolor flow cytometry could be used to simultaneously monitor infections of different cell types and/or viruses from a single culture. Thus, modifications of the method described in this study could make the use of flow cytometry considerably more practical and automated for routine use in clinical microbiology laboratories.",

Its potential advantages over fluorescent microscopy include better quantitation of low levels of infection and earlier detection of virally infected cells in culture systems. These could lead to faster laboratory identification of pathogenic viruses. The use of flow cytometry on direct clinical specimens was not explored but could be studied in the future on cellular specimens such as those from the respiratory tract. Prospective application of this method to patient isolates is still needed to confirm its validity. The analyses in this study were limited to enterovirus, but the methods that were tested and discussed can be applied to a wide array of other clinically important viruses. Adenovirus, emerging coronaviruses, and influenza virus, including highly pathogenic strains, affect the public health and in each case, knowledge of serotype provides important strain information and epidemiologic data. Additional studies are still needed to extend the methods presented to other viruses and optimize detection strategies.",
