In the Veneto region, Northeast of Italy, we recently calculated an overall prevalence of SD of 0.8/100 000/year in the young, based only upon autopsy reports [13]. When focusing the attention only on young athletes the prevalence was twice that in young non athletes, i.e. 1.6/100 000/year; these figures are explained by the existence of cardiovascular diseases which cause a risk of SD during effort, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and congenital coronary anomalies.",

In our experience, the most common causes include premature coronary atherosclerosis (21%), ARVC (14%), mitral valve prolapse (12%), non-atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (11%), myocarditis (10%), conduction system disease (9%) and HCM (7%). It is noteworthy that 6% of all SDs remained unexplained even after thorough macroscopic and histologic examination. Whether these are truly idiopathic or unexplained due to an inability to identify subtle pathologic substrates remains to be elucidated. It may be that structural abnormality resides at molecular level, thus enhancing the need for molecular biology investigation [14].",

In situ hybridization provides the direct detection of nucleic acid in cellular material in which simultaneous morphological analysis can be performed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allows millions of copies of any specific DNA sequence to be generated in a few hours. The reaction consists of an in vitro enzymatic amplification of defined DNA sequence by repeated rounds of heat denaturation, primer annealing and DNA polymerase-mediated primer extension. The amplified DNA can then be seen as a distinct band after standard agarose gel electrophoresis, and the specificity of detection can be increased by subsequent hybridization or DNA sequencing. According to the nested PCR technique, a second pair of primers \u2018internal\u2019 to the original primer pair used in a subsequent series of amplification cycles. Using this strategy, the sensitivity is enhanced from 100 to 1000 times, to such an extent that even a single copy target can be detected in a complex background of 300 000 cells or more.",

Given the extreme sensitivity of these techniques, particularly of PCR, a single copy of a gene can be readily detected even from an extremely small amount of tissue. The decision to develop and apply PCR for routine diagnosis of myocarditis must be considered in relation to the low cost, speed, sensitivity and reliability of more conventional culture and/or serological methods [15]. Different molecular strategies have now been developed to recognize and distinguish an infective from a latent state of virus. In addition to qualitative analysis and genome sequencing different methods have been developed for the quantification of PCR product. Quantification of different viral genome has now successfully introduced into routine diagnostic virology as a prognostic marker of severe infective disease. Genome quantification may also allow to accurately assess the risk of infection and to monitor the therapeutic response [16].",

This could permit an ever more frequent application not only for perspective but also for retrospective studies of either genetically determined or infective cardiovascular diseases. The recent description of a successful identification 22 years later of inherited long QT syndrome in a 12-year-old girl who had died suddenly, through molecular testing of archived paraffin-embedded myocardial samples, is emblematic [17]. First of all, this result has potentially great importance for forensic science by providing a plausible mechanism for cardiac arrest in the setting of an otherwise structurally normal heart.

            "text": "Myocarditis accounted for up to 44% of fatal events in major series on cardiac SD in the young [18]. The strongest evidence that subclinical myocarditis can be a cause of ventricular fibrillation comes from an autopsy series on USA army recruits in which 42% of those who died suddenly had histological evidence of myocarditis [19]. Whether the high incidence of myocarditis in this series is due to a selection bias towards more tropical diseases as well as to an overestimation of inflammatory infiltrates due to the absence of standardized diagnostic criteria remains intriguing. Although myocarditis usually presents with signs of pump failure and ventricular dilatation, ventricular arrhythmias have been described in patients with myocarditis and apparently normal hearts. A recent flu-like illness is common, although the symptoms may be mild and clinical signs of heart failure subtle or absent. Cardiac involvement is unpredictable and may affect the conduction system, causing heart block, or the ordinary myocardium, causing ventricular arrhythmias. SD may occur both in the active or healed phases as a consequences of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias that develop mostly in the setting of an unstable myocardial substrate, namely inflammatory infiltrate, interstitial edema, myocardial necrosis and fibrosis. The gross appearance of the heart is not distinctive and its weight may be within normal values. A major limitation in the autopsy diagnosis of myocarditis in several series has been the lack of standardized histological criteria. A \u2018starry-like sky\u2019 feature (>14 leucocytes/mm2) or a patchy inflammatory infiltrate, either polymorphous or lymphocytic, sometimes no more than 3 foci at a magnification of 6\u00d7, and not necessarily associated with myocyte necrosis, are typical features. This subtle substrate, together with the possible inflammatory involvement of the conduction system, seems highly arrhythmogenic and may account for unexpected arrhythmic cardiac arrest. To increase diagnostic sensitivity of histology, use of immunohistochemistry by means of a large panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies is mandatory to identify and characterize the inflammatory infiltrate.",

Viruses rarely cause evident cytopathic damage, so that classical morphology often fails to identify the etiological agents. The diagnosis of viral myocarditis has, for a long time, been based on viral culture and serology. However, these investigations are time consuming and generally fall short in specificity and sensitivity. More recently, molecular biology techniques as PCR and nested-PCR have been shown to rapidly detect the presence of infective agents, in specific and very sensitive way.

On the contrary, coronary SD in the young is usually due to a single subobstructive plaque, located at the first segment of the anterior descending coronary artery, mostly fibrocellular, devoid of atheroma, fissuring or thrombosis [7] (Fig. 2). In the setting of acute thrombosis, superficial erosion seems to be a peculiar mechanism precipitating plaque instability, unlike in adults where it is mainly due to rupture of the thin fibrous cap of an atheromatous plaque [24]. Endothelial erosion may be the consequence of either plaque inflammation or intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation [25]. The inflammatory nature of atherosclerotic plaque components prompted the postulation that either infection and/or autoimmune phenomena are involved in the onset and progression of the disease [26]. Several reports, using molecular hybridization assays, have shown a correlation between the occurrence of atherosclerosis and the presence of infective microorganisms, like herpesviruses and Chlamydia pneumoniae[27]. Although a cause\u2014effect relationship is far from being demonstrated and these microorganisms could act simply as \u2018innocent bystanders\u2019, some microbial infections have been associated with acute coronary syndromes; in particular, an increase in enterovirus-specific antibodies at the time of myocardial infarction diagnosis suggests a role for this virus in triggering acute coronary syndromes [28,29], thus opening new avenues of research in unstable coronary plaques.",

Heart dysfunction appears more in the form of electrical instability than of impaired contractility, which, on the contrary, may be enhanced. Risk factors are considered to be youth, previous syncopal episodes, a malignant family history, myocardial ischemia, sustained ventricular tachycardia on electrophysiological test and ventricular tachycardia on holter monitoring, attenuated blood pressure changes on exercise and enhanced QRS fractionation of the extrasystole [30]. Recently, molecular genetic studies demonstrated that HCM is a heterogeneous disease, with several missense mutations in genes encoding for proteins of the cardiac sarcomere, among which \u03b2-myosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin T, \u03b1-tropomyosin, myosin binding C and actinin [31]. Despite data on genotype\u2014phenotype correlations are still preliminary, it seems that the phenotype varies not only with the type of mutation but also within individuals carrying the same mutation. For instance the arginine-to-glutamine mutation in 403 codon of \u03b2-myosin is associated with a poor prognosis, whereas the arginine-to-tryptophan mutation appears more benign [32]. Moreover, the knowledge that myosin-binding protein C mutations appear to be associated with age-related penetrance in adulthood and that troponin T mutation is associated with up to 50% of non penetrance, no or mild hypertrophy (HCM \u2018without hypertrophy\u2019) and a high risk of SD, even in the absence of severe left ventricular hypertrophy, would have consequences for genetic counselling. The recent pointing out of a high frequency of hepatitis C virus in the hearts of patients with the apical form of HCM is intriguing and opens new avenues of investigation [33].",

The septal bulging together with a septal endocardial plaque and anterior mitral valve leaflet thickening, may account for the left ventricular outflow gradient. The combination of myocardial disarray and interstitial fibrosis represent an ideal substrate of inhomogeneous intraventricular conduction with potential reentry phenomena. More recently, a detailed pathology study on young subjects dying suddenly demonstrated that the superimposition of ischemic damage, in the form of myocyte necrosis and large fibrous scars mimicking healed infarction [34]. The ischemic damage occurs in the absence of significant epicardial coronary artery disease, although small vessel disease as well as intramural course of the left anterior descending coronary artery have been noted. Elevated intramyocardial diastolic pressure may restrict intramural arteries during diastole thus impairing coronary filling and myocardial perfusion. The combination of myocardial disarray and replacement fibrosis has to be considered the malignant arrhythmogenic substrate in HCM.",

Histology discloses the disappearance of the RV myocardium with the fibro-fatty or fatty replacement, extending from the epicardium towards the endocardium. The intraventricular conduction delay, consequent to fibro-fatty replacement, is a source of electrical instability, due to reentrant phenomena, in the shape of ventricular arrhythmias with left bundle branch block morphology, indicating a right ventricular origin. Familiarity with an autosomal dominant inheritance has been demonstrated in nearly 50% of cases [37]. Six loci have been identified by linkage analysis so far, two mapping to chromosome 14 and the remaining to chromosomes 1, 2, 3 and 10, one each. Recently, we identified a mutation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene in families who map to chromosome 1q42\u2013q43 [38]. A recessive form associated with palmoplantar keratosis has also been also reported on chromosome 17 and a defective gene encoding for a cell-to-cell adhesion molecule, i.e. plakoglobin, has been found [39]. Apoptosis has been demonstrated to account for myocyte death both in autopsy and biopsy material [40]. RV aneurysms, left ventricular involvement, focal myocarditis as well as bouts of apoptosis, most probably worsen ventricular electrical vulnerability and lower the ventricular fibrillation threshold. Evidence of inflammatory infiltrates associate with myocyte death is a frequent finding in several pathological series [41]: whether inflammation is primary or secondary to cell death remains to be established. To test the infective etiopathogenetic theory, we recently did a nested PCR investigation which failed to detect any enteroviral genome in biopsies of ARVC patients with both recent and chronic clinical onset of the disease [42]. However, it may be that other types of virus are involved and need to be searched for.",

The natural history demonstrates that death occurs not only due to progressive congestive heart failure or as a complication of thromboembolism, but also abruptly due to arrhythmic cardiac arrest. Although death is obviously expected along the natural history, in a few cases arrhythmic SD may be the first manifestation of the disease and the diagnosis is achieved only at postmortem by observing a heavy heart with dilated ventricles and no inflammatory myocardial or coronary artery disease. As far as molecular basis of dilated cardiomyopathy, at least 30% of cases are inherited, with a significant percentage of the remaining cases being acquired (i.e. myocarditis, autoimmune, etc.). Inherited forms may have autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, or mitochondrial transmission, with evident genetic heterogeneity [43]. The persistence of a viral infection is thought to have a pathogenetic role in different chronic myocardial diseases with unknown etiology [44,45]. Different molecular techniques have produced controversial results with respect to the rate of enteroviral positivity in myocardial samples of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Several studies showed no, or a very low percentage of, enteroviral PCR positivity in patients suffering from the end stage of dilated cardiomyopathy [22]. Viral clearance or involvement of other cardiotropic viruses, such as adenovirus, human cytomegalovirus, coronavirus and hepatitis C virus, could explain the apparently negative findings.",

Aortic dissection in Marfan syndrome may be also observed without dilatation of the aorta, so that its occurrence may be unpredictable on the clinical grounds. The basic defect of spontaneous laceration of the ascending aorta consists in elastic disruption and cystic medial necrosis in the tunica media leading to aortic wall fragility. A severe pattern of cystic medial necrosis, quite similar to that observed in the aortic tunica media of patients with Marfan's syndrome, has been reported in patients who died suddenly with bicuspid aortic valve, either isolated or associated with isthmal coarctation, suggesting a possible genetic background with a developmental defect involving both the aortic valve and the ascending aorta (Fig. 5).

Left ventricular hypertrophy, isolation of the coronary ostia because of fusion of semilunar cusps with the aortic wall, as well as stenotic intraaortic course of the proximal coronary arteries, are all factors that account for the coronary ischemia in these patients [51]. Williams syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by supravalvular aortic stenosis, peripheral pulmonary stenosis, obstructive coronary lesions, abnormal facies and mental retardation.

            "text": "The long QT syndrome is a familial disease with high cardiac electrical instability, presenting with syncope due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias or with cardiac arrest on exercise or emotional stress, often under the age of 15 [52]. The cause of death at necropsy cannot be ascertained unless there are prior ECG data. Genetic analysis reveals multiple abnormalities in genes related to both cardiac potassium and cardiac sodium channels. At present, important genotype\u2014phenotype correlations and the identification of gene-specific arrhythmogenic triggers are slowly emerging. Alterations of ion pumps and currents account for the lengthening of the action potential and prolonged QT interval on ECG, and the propensity to ventricular fibrillation. The mortality in untreated symptomatic cases exceeds 60% within 15 years. Clearly ECG screening of surviving relatives is the only clinical way to establish the diagnosis in asymptomatic carriers. On the basis of pattern of transmission, two major clinical syndromes have been described: the more common autosomal dominant form with a pure cardiac phenotype (Romano\u2014Ward) [53] and the rarer autosomal recessive form characterized by the association with congenital deafness (Jervell and Lang-Nilesen) [54].",

These ECG characteristics may depend on exaggerated transmural differences in action potential configuration, especially in the right ventricular outflow tract. By studying a family with a SD case, confirmation of an organic substrate was given by Corrado et al. [57], who reported not only fibro-fatty dystrophy in the RV free wall but also involvement of the conduction system with sclerotic interruption of the right bundle branch. The coexistence of both \u2018septal\u2019 and \u2018parietal\u2019 right conduction defects might account for the ECG pattern of right bundle branch block and persistent ST segment elevation with ventricular electrical instability.",

At least one variant of the Brugada syndrome is caused by mutations in cardiac sodium channels gene SCN5A, the same gene which is implicated in the LQT3 syndrome [58]. The mutation of SCN5A causes loss of function in the Brugada syndrome and gain of function in the LQT3. In particular, it results in the Brugada syndrome in reduced sodium current density, thus accounting for the loss of the epicardial action potential dome with transmural dispersion of repolarization, which in turn may predispose to the development of ventricular fibrillation. However, other families with Brugada syndrome have been tested showing no defects on the cardiac sodium channel, thus suggesting genetic heterogeneity in analogy with other inherited cardiac diseases.",

ECG and echocardiographic studies are essential preliminary investigations carried out in all first degree family members. Unfortunately, they can detect only a small proportion of gene carriers, particularly in children, where phenotypic expression may still be absent. Genetic screening is theoretically the most effective tool in the early recognition of asymptomatic genetic carriers. The potential benefit for patients and family members is self-evident, since in the majority of cases SD may be the first and sole manifestation of a familial disease. Moreover, the risk of cardiac arrest is demonstrably higher with some specific mutation. However, there are some concerns about genetic screening. First, at present it is an expensive, laborious procedure, and can be done only at a few tertiary referral centers, with a specific research interest in molecular genetics. There are pressures to study families because of competition in science. Some people question whether genetic knowledge is beneficial, neutral or harmful, and whether parents have the right to make decisions for their children, especially when a disease is not manifest until middle age and little can be offered in terms of treatment.",
