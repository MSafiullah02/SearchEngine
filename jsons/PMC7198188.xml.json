[2,3] Patients report self-collected nasal swabs are easy to perform [2,4,5] and highly acceptable [2,4]. A meta-analysis of 9 studies comparing self-collect (SC) and health care worker collect (HC) for influenza testing reported a pooled sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 99% for SC compared to HC [6]. Irving et al studied paired samples from 240 adults and found sensitivity using nasal or nasopharyngeal (NP) collection for influenza did not vary significantly when using a highly sensitive molecular test [7]. A study in 230 children reported equivalent sensitivity for all respiratory viruses except respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) when comparing nasal swab and NP aspirate [8]. Larios et al demonstrated that using flocked swabs and sensitive molecular methods, equivalent sensitivity and specificity was obtained for matched self-collected mid-turbinate nasal swabs and NP swabs in 38 individuals for a range of respiratory viruses including human coronaviruses [9].",

Wolfel et al noted no discernible difference between nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal viral loads in hospitalized cases of COVID-19.14] Given these high viral loads throughout the respiratory tract it may be that requiring NP sampling is not as significant for SARS-CoV-2 as for some other respiratory viruses. It may also be that PCR methods for viral detection are improving the sensitivity of a range of sample and collection methods as shown for a range of respiratory viruses but also Group A Streptococcal detection. [9,10] We hypothesize that the high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and sensitive molecular techniques may explain the equivalent sensitivity of SC to HC samples in COVID-19 patients.",

This was the case for two COVID-19 positive patients on SC who were only diagnosed by SCN and another only by SCT. If only one swab site was obtainable, our data suggests the nasal may be the better swab site for the diagnosis of COVID-19 as it had greater concordance with the AP group and showed consistently lower Ct values in the order of 100-1000 fold higher viral load (data not shown). Furthermore, we have instituted use of a single swab to sample both throat then nasal sites.
