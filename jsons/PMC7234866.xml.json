            "text": "The COVID-19 epidemic has changed the way medicine is practised almost throughout the world. Age has emerged as the most impressive risk factor of succumbing to COVID-19. Among the large population of elderly patients who are treated for COVID-19, there is a strong prevalence of cardiovascular and pulmonary comorbidity, which suggests that frailty rather than age confers susceptibility to COVID-19. Thus, the consideration that no resources should be invested into the elderly per se, for example, by withholding admission to intensive care units for patients with COVID-19 beyond a certain age, is therefore not only ethically questionable but also scientifically false. Further, in contrast to what might be expected, chronic immunosuppression and cancer do not seem to be major predictors of COVID-19 vulnerability, although few data are available on this topic so far. Limited reports on COVID-19 and cancer which stem from China indicate that the disease course of COVID-19 may be more severe in patients with cancer but do not allow to definitely conclude that cancer as such increases the risk of COVID-19, however likely this may seem.1 Among 1524 patients with cancer from a single institution in Wuhan, 12 patients (0.79%) had severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which was higher than the cumulative incidence of 0.37% of COVID-19 cases in the respective general population.2 However, it is inappropriate to conclude that patients seen at a cancer centre share the same risk factors of cardiopulmonary comorbidity and age as the general population. In a survey of 2007 COVID-19 cases from 575 hospitals in China, 18 patients had cancer, a figure that we do not interpret as evidence of strong associations between COVID-19 and cancer.3 The most common diagnosis was lung cancer (5 of 18 patients, 28%), and three-quarter of the patients (12 of 18) were not undergoing active anticancer therapy but were cancer survivors in routine follow-up. The authors stress that the rate of cancer among their patients with COVID-19 exceeds that of the general population, but without controlling for age and comorbidity; therefore, such figures need to be interpreted with caution.",

We need to outline that teleconferences and videoconsulting are valid alternatives, although hopefully a transient measure only. There is a priori no evidence to suggest that coming to an outpatient visit to the hospital is more dangerous than going to visit relatives or for shopping. It is important to outline that it is not the hospital per se, but the number of other people encountered on the journey and the vigour with which social distancing is maintained that likely determines risk of infection. We must avoid inferior outcome of our patients simply because these are too afraid to come to the hospital when in fact they should. Finally, we also need to make sure that we maintain the specialised neuro-oncology workforce at our institutions, for example, by reorganising multidisciplinary tumour boards to remote conferences or conferences with one decision maker per discipline only.",

            "text": "It is a common theme in neuro-oncology that therapeutic interventions for which there is no evidence should not routinely be offered to patients. It just seems to be so much easier for many healthcare providers and also caregivers to recommend specific medical interventions even in the absence of clear evidence, because it is perceived as easier and associated with less psychological burden than adequate advance care planning, including an honest weighing of the options. Typical interventions that are often questionable include serial operations for tumours that cannot be controlled surgically, repeat irradiation that is often combined with immunosuppressive steroids or \u2018salvage\u2019 chemotherapies beyond one or two alkylators for patients with gliomas, for example, platinum-based regimens or irinotecan. These are just a few important measures commonly encountered in clinical practice for which no supportive data from controlled trials exist. It is only now that many of us realise that we occasionally treat where we should not. Further, we should prudently weigh risk and benefit of systemic pharmacotherapy in all disease areas where there is little or no evidence for pharmacotherapy at all, not only in meningioma or ependymoma in adults but also in recurrent glioblastoma, where no intervention except nitrosoureas in patients with tumours with O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation is likely to confer meaningful disease control. The attitude towards too generous corticosteroid prescriptions has already changed in recent years, but the time has come now to verify the need for steroid medication in every patient, notably also during radiotherapy, where these agents are still occasionally given by default. On the other hand, treatments with clear benefits such as combined radiochemotherapy in MGMT promoter-methylated newly diagnosed glioblastoma should not be withheld from patients by default. This applies also to highly immunosuppressive treatments, such as high-dose chemotherapy in primary central nervous system lymphoma. Here, we have provided some key considerations for the managment of brain tumor patients during the current COVID-19 pandemic (Box 1).",

It is common practice to scan patients with brain tumour in regular intervals even after years of stable disease without intervention. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we should explore whether we may delay repeat scanning and outpatient visits in patients in stable conditions who are asymptomatic. Radiotherapy schedules can probably be adapted to hypofractionation in defined patient populations, for example, patients with brain metastases or MGMT promoter-unmethylated glioblastoma, without compromising outcome, but with a major reduction in hospital visits. For systemic chemotherapy that is potentially immunosuppressive, including alkylating agent chemotherapy, dosing should be conservative and the tresholds for dose reductions may need to be lowered to improve safety, notably in diseases where prolonged exposure to treatment is probably needed, for example, lower WHO grade gliomas.",

Scepticism regarding alkylating agent chemotherapy is even more appropriate in the recurrent setting, where neither temozolomide nor nitrosoureas offers major clinical benefit unless the MGMT promoter is methylated.",

This cannot be regulated by recommendations in ESMO Open or elsewhere, but strongly depends on local circumstances. What is important in the current situation is to indicate in any medical report somehow the overall prognosis of each patient to ascertain that those colleagues who have to make decisions under stress and time and resource limits are adequately informed. Patients with curatively operated tumours, for example, schwannomas or meningiomas, who have no evidence of recurrent disease must not be placed in the same category as patients with recurrent glioblastoma, but having a brain tumour is still often perceived as stigmatising.",

For most phase II trials, patients already enrolled onto trials and being stable may be kept on trial with a careful risk:benefit ratio from the patient perspective, not from a trial perspective. Essentially, the same holds true for phase III trials; however, clinical trials evaluating novel treatments that are associated with immunosuppression raise ethical concerns: randomising in the current situation against a standard of care indicates that the benefit of the new intervention is uncertain, but the perceived risk of increased sensitivity to infection would seem to make it prohibitory to place patients on such trials. Particular concern applies to placebo-controlled trials in this situation. Resorting to teleconferences and videoconsultations and allowing drug shipment to patients include a few measures that may maintain trial integrity without placing patients at undue risk. Importantly, several companies sponsoring clinical trials have put activities on hold already, and, again, many institutions have imposed their own rules on how clinical research is conducted, and these regulations obviously over-rule any outside recommendations.",

More complicated is the situation of patients with brain tumour tested for COVID-19 as part of a screen who come back positive but are asymptomatic for COVID-19.
