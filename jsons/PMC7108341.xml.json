The new technological tools allowed the recent discovery of two new hCoVs: one, referred to as NL63, belongs to group I and is distantly related to 229E (Fouchier et al., 2004, Van der Hoek et al., 2004), and the second, referred to as HKU1, is more closely related to the group II prototype hCoV-OC43 (Woo et al., 2005a). HCoV-HKU1 was first detected in two patients with pneumonia in Hong-Kong (Woo et al., 2005a), and then reported elsewhere (Esper et al., 2006, Garbino et al., 2006, Sloots et al., 2006, Vabret et al., 2006, Woo et al., 2005b). In addition, a number of studies from different countries have shown that hCoV-NL63 can be recovered from respiratory secretions of both immunocompetent children and immunocompromised adults (Arden et al., 2005, Bastien et al., 2005, Boivin et al., 2005, Chiu et al., 2005, Ebihara et al., 2005, Gerna et al., 2006a, Mo\u00ebs et al., 2005).",

This difference was statistically significant (p\n = 0.04), and was not observed between the two members of group I hCoVs. Neither bronchiolitis nor pneumonia were detected in our series of HKU1-infected patients. Following the initial report describing the association of HKU1 infection with pneumonia in two adult patients, an epidemiological and clinical study extended to the entire patient population in Hong Kong reported a predominance of upper ARTI, in agreement with the present study (Woo et al., 2005b).",

Diagnosis was performed by RT-PCR, but MAb appeared to be a promising complement or alternative to RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis showed that genotypes A and B co-circulate. As with other hCoVs, the simultaneous presence in NPAs of other respiratory viruses in association with HKU1 was a frequent event. HKU1 infections were by far predominantly associated with upper respiratory tract syndromes, and the most common symptom was rhinorrhea. No association with bronchiolitis or pneumonia was observed.",
