            "text": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) is a dicarboxypeptidase that cleaves Angiotensin I (ANG I) to form angiotensin (ANG) II. Its enzymatically active homologue, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), by contrast, degrades ANG II to form ANG-(1-7) as well as other substrates (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . There is limited information on whether organ-specific ACE2 expression is altered when ACE is decreased in genetic models where ACE is absent. If ACE2 acts indeed as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by regulating angiotensin II levels then ACE2 should decrease when ACE decreases and conversely ACE2 activity should increase when ACE activity increases. This mode of physiologic regulation, however, can be altered in pathophysiologic conditions. For instance, it is known that in kidneys from diabetic mice ACE2 and ACE change in the opposite direction (6) (7) (8) (9) , such that in renal cortex from diabetic db/db (6, 7) and STZ mice (6) ACE is decreased, whereas ACE2 is increased. Of note, within the glomeruli from db/db mice (9) ACE and ACE2 are also altered in the opposite manner (high ACE and low ACE2) which is just the contrary of that seen in proximal tubules (6, 9) . This finding in diabetic mice was generally confirmed in kidney biopsies from patients with diabetic kidney disease (10) . To examine whether deficiency of kidney ACE results in the expected physiologic decrease in kidney ACE2 expression we used two different genetic models of ACE ablation . Captopril and telmisartan moreover were used to pharmacologically inhibit ACE activity and block the AT1 receptor, respectively .",

            "text": "We reasoned that this issue should be investigated by assessing ACE2 expression using membrane membranes prepared from target organs where this protein resides. In polarized epithelia like the lungs, kidneys and intestine, ACE2 in its full length form is anchored to the apical plasma membrane (9) . The kidney has abundant ACE2 in the apical border of the proximal tubule where it colocalizes with ACE (9) . The lungs, by contrast, have a low level of ACE2 expression such that the metabolism of angiotensin II and formation of angiotensin 1-7 depends on enzymes other than ACE2, namely POP (25) . To determine whether deficiency of kidney ACE alters kidney ACE2 expression we used two different genetic models of ACE ablation. To mimic the clinical setting of patients receiving RAS blockers are exposed to the current COVID -19 pandemic, captopril and telmisartan were administered for 2 weeks to pharmacologically inhibit ACE activity and the AT1 receptor, respectively.",

The decrease in ACE2 at the level of protein was not accompanied by a reduction in kidney ACE2 mRNA. This confirms that ACE2 can be regulated post transcriptionally as previously reported by us(6) and others (29) . Our finding that ACE2 mRNA was unchanged in ACE deficient mice is also consistent with a previous report in another genetic model, the tisACE-/-knockout mice, that lacks tissue ACE and possess about 40% of normal circulating levels of ACE (30) . Similar to our results in two models of kidney ACE deficiency, in tisACE-/-mice kidney expression of ACE2 mRNA was not altered by ACE depletion. ACE2 protein abundance or activity, however, were not determined in this previous study (30) Altogether, these findings suggest that changes in ACE 2 occur post transcriptionally and are accompanied by changes in ACE2 in the same direction such a decrease in kidney ACE is apt to be associated with a decrease in kidney ACE2. Overall the directionally observed changes are consistent with a physiologic role of ACE2 in terms of regulating its main substrate, Angiotensin II (5) . Given the intense interest on ACE2 as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor we next wanted to see if a similar directional change in ACE2 occurs when an ACE inhibitor or a AT1 blocker is chronically administered.",

In polarized epithelia like the lungs, kidneys and intestine, ACE2 in its full length form is anchored to the apical plasma membrane (9) . The effect of ACEi and ARBs on ACE2 protein expression in the lungs has not been previously studied and previous studies in kidney and other organs gave variable results (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . Here we show that captopril and telmisartan both decrease kidney ACE2 protein in isolated membranes without significantly affecting protein abundance in total cell lysates ( Figure   3 ). Captopril in particular produced a marked decline in ACE2 protein in isolated membranes while increasing cytosolic ACE2( Figure 3C ) . The latter result was somewhat unexpected because Ang II has been shown to produce internalization of ACE2 in cultured cells (31) . The discrepancy between this previous study in ACE2-transfected neuroblastoma cells and our findings with in vivo chronic administration of captopril are not apparent to us but clearly the experimental conditions are widely different .",

In a transgenic model of cardiac ACE overexpression and kidney ACE ablation, ACE2 protein in the kidney was also decreased. This suggest that changes in the expression in one enzyme may elicit similarly directional changes in the other homologue such that formation and degradation of ANG II can be coupled. The administration of an ACE inhibitor and an AT1 receptor blocker decreased ACE2 protein expression in kidney isolated membranes and had no detectable effect on ACE2 activity in lung isolated membranes where ACE2 expression is very low. These findings altogether suggest that two potential target sites for SARS-CoV-2 infection where ACE2 is expressed , the kidney and lung apical membrane, RAS blockers decrease or had no effect on ACE2 expression. We conclude that these medications do not increase ACE2 expression in lung or kidney epithelia and therefore can no longer be considered to pose a risk for COVID-19. This information supports the position of many medical societies and recent publications expressing the view that RAS blockers should not be abandoned in COVID-19 patients or the large number of people that can be potentially exposed .
