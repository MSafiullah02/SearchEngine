            "text": "Phospholipid bilayers closely resemble cell membranes in some key respects. For example, they retain two-dimensional fluidity and can be an excellent environment for presenting membrane proteins. Model bilayer systems allow for the investigation of biological processes that occur at the cellular level, providing information about ligand\u2013receptor interactions [1], [2], [3], [4], viral attack [5], [6], and cellular signaling events [7], [8], [9]. In the 1960s Mueller et al. developed the first system for the investigation of the electrical properties of a planar phospholipid bilayer [10], [11]. This system, usually referred to as a black lipid membrane, consisted of phospholipid molecules painted across a 1 mm hole between two solution chambers. Twenty years later Tamm and McConnell deposited lipid membranes directly onto solid supports [12]. In 1997 Boxer et al. pioneered the partitioning of supported phospholipid bilayers into lithographically patterned corrals [13]. This led to the development of individually addressed arrays of solid supported phospholipid bilayers by Cremer and Yang [14] and sensor arrays for the study of cell adhesion by Groves et al. [15].",

            "text": "In certain instances black lipid membranes and even lipid vesicles in bulk solution have an advantage over solid supported phospholipid bilayers. For example, they avoid direct contact with an underlying substrate that can potentially be problematic for the presentation of transmembrane proteins. They also allow solution phase access to both sides of the membrane. However, they are less stable than supported membranes, harder to manipulate chemically, and are far less accessible to surface specific detection techniques. Therefore, it would be desirable to develop methods to appropriately embed transmembrane proteins into supported bilayers. To this end, Spinke et al. laid the foundation for polymer supported phospholipid bilayers on planar solid substrates [19]. It was found that thin polymer films could couple bilayers with a large variety of materials such as metal films, oxides, and semiconductor electrodes. Adding a polymer layer between an underlying substrate and the phospholipid bilayer can be achieved by the use of either a cushioning polymer film [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25] or the direct tethering of the membrane to a lipid presenting polymer or peptide layer [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. Other effective surface modification strategies include self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) [32], [33] and the use of adsorbed or bound proteins as a cushioning layer [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]. To this day, however, there is not yet a completely satisfactory supported membrane system for the presentation of transmembrane proteins with both large extracellular and intracellular peripheral domains.",

            "text": "Due to their amphiphilic nature, phospholipid membranes are capable of organizing not only themselves but also associated proteins, nanoparticles, as well as other species either within the membrane or at its surface. Furthermore, phospholipid vesicles can be formed into nanoliter sized compartments and tubules providing molecular confinement and transport [40]. Such compartments can also be used as nanoreactors for enzymes [41], [42], [43], [44]. Phospholipid structures can even serve as templates for nanostructure fabrication by imparting controlled positioning and growth of metal layers, proteins, and polymers into the system of interest [45], [46]. Perhaps the most elegant use of phospholipid membranes in nanodevice applications involves their employment in sensor platforms.

When making a choice of membrane platform, it is necessary to consider the analyte of interest. For example, solid supported bilayers on glass substrates are often sufficient for presenting small ligands for the study of multivalent interactions with extracellular proteins. On the other hand, if one wishes to incorporate transmembrane proteins or pore-forming toxins into the bilayer, it may be necessary to use a polymer cushioned bilayer or a black lipid membrane to prevent protein denaturation on the underlying substrate. Almost equally important is the detection scheme. A conducting substrate is required if the sensor design calls for a direct electrical measurement. In this case the bilayer can be supported on an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrode or even a gold electrode if an appropriately hydrophilic alkanethiol monolayer is employed. A good review of phospholipid membranes on solid surfaces is Ref. [51].",

The formation of folded lipid bilayers requires a cell with two compartments separated by a small aperture and the solution levels in each compartment must be controlled independently (Fig. 2\n). Both compartments are filled with the desired aqueous solution and a monolayer of phospholipid material is spread on top of one of the compartments. The solution level in the compartment containing the lipid monolayer is slowly lowered below the aperture and raised again. This deposits a monolayer on each pass to form the completed bilayer membrane [53].",

One of the most important is the formation of ion channels in phospholipid bilayers by peptides [54], proteins [55], [56], antibiotics [57], and other pore-forming biomolecules. Of particular interest for creating nanodevices is the insertion of single protein pores for use as stochastic sensors (Fig. 3\n). This has been accomplished by Gu et al. through the use of genetically modified \u03b1-hemolysin [49]. Naturally occurring \u03b1-hemolysin, which is composed of seven identical subunits, is an exotoxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria [58]. Through the use of genetic modification, \u03b1-hemolysin mutants were created which can non-covalently capture a cyclodextrin molecule within its pore. A current change at fixed voltage is measured when the cyclodextrin inserts into the channel due to a restriction of the pore cross-section. The current is further attenuated by the binding of a guest molecule in the cyclodextrin binding pocket. The binding and unbinding of small organic molecules within the cyclodextrin/\u03b1-hemolysin pore can ultimately be measured at the single molecule level via this process [49].",

In order to support a high quality membrane (i.e. little or no defects and high lipid mobility) the surface should be hydrophilic, smooth, and clean. The best substrates are fused silica [12], [61], borosilicate glass [12], [62], mica [63], [64], and oxidized silicon [12]. Attempts have been made to deposit supported bilayers on single crystals of TiO2 and SrTiO2 as well as on thin films of SiO2 on LiNbO3 crystals [65], [66], [67]. Thin films can be used as solid supports as observed with TiO2 [68], [69], [70], indium-tin-oxide [71], [72], gold [73], [74], silver [75], and platinum [76].",

This is followed by the transfer of an upper leaflet by the Langmuir\u2013Schaefer procedure, which involves horizontally dipping the substrate to create the second layer [12]. A second method of supported bilayer formation is the adsorption and fusion of vesicles from an aqueous suspension to the substrate surface (Fig. 5b) [77], [78]. Also, a combination of the two methods can be employed by first transferring a monolayer via the Langmuir\u2013Blodgett technique followed by vesicle fusion to form the upper layer (Fig. 5c) [79].",

The transfer of amphiphilic molecules from the air\u2013water interface to a solid substrate dates back to the 1920s [80]. An excellent review of this topic is found in Ref. [81]. Tamm and McConnell were the first to apply this technology to form supported phospholipid bilayers by sequential monolayer transfer onto quartz, glass, and oxidized silicon substrates [12]. This method is useful for the formation of asymmetric bilayers [70]; however, it is difficult if not impossible to incorporate transmembrane proteins into the lipid bilayer with this technique because prior to transfer portions of the proteins within the monolayer are exposed to air and can become irreversibly denatured [79].",

            "text": "The adsorption and fusion of small unilaminar vesicles (SUVs) is one of the easiest and most versatile means for forming solid supported phospholipid bilayers (Fig. 5b). SUVs can be prepared by a plethora of methods. The simplest involves the extrusion of multilaminar vesicles through porous polycarbonate membranes at high pressure [82], [83], [84], [85]. Another method is the sonication and ultracentrifugation of aqueous lipid suspensions [86]. The incorporation of transmembrane proteins into SUVs requires a gentler process such as detergent removal via dialysis [87], [88]. Factors affecting the adsorption and fusion of SUVs to solid supports include: the vesicle composition, size, surface charge, surface roughness, surface cleanliness, solution pH, ionic strength, and the osmotic pressure of the vesicles [68], [89]. The process begins with the adsorption of vesicles from the bulk solution onto the substrate (Fig. 6\n). In the early stages, SUVs may fuse with one another [89]. The vesicles then rupture and fuse to the substrate forming planar supported bilayers in a process that depends upon the chemistry of the individual lipids [90]. The adsorption process can be accelerated by the presence of divalent cations such Ca2+ and Mg2+ [70]. Fusion of SUVs to the substrate can also be enhanced by heating [72], creating an osmotic gradient across the vesicle membrane [68], and by the addition of fusigenic agents such as polyethylene glycol [37]. Although the exact mechanism of bilayer formation from the adsorption and fusion of SUVs is not fully understood, mathematical modeling of the system has shown good agreement with experimental results [91].",

Furthermore, it has been observed that negatively charged vesicles do not easily fuse to glass substrates at basic pH values and low ionic strengths [62].

Unprotected solid supported lipid bilayers are known to delaminate from the supporting substrate upon passage through an air\u2013water interface [95]. This is problematic when developing practical biosensors based upon supported lipid bilayers because the membrane must be constantly hydrated. It is therefore highly advantageous if the system can be dried after fabrication and rehydrated just prior to use. Systems affording air stability include hybrid bilayers [33], protein stabilized lipid bilayers [95], and polymerized membranes formed using synthetic diacetylene-containing phospholipids [96], [97], [98], [99]. However, these systems can suffer from either poor lipid mobility or are almost completely covered with protein. Both of these problems detract from the ability to employ the platform in sensing applications. Recently, an air-stable system has been developed that maintains both high lipid mobility and is capable of binding analyte proteins to ligands presented at the lipid bilayer surface [100]. This is achieved by fusing vesicles containing polyethylene oxide oligomers conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG-PE) lipids to glass substrates as illustrated in Fig. 7\n. The PEG-PE lipids within the bilayer serve two functions. They increase the bending elastic modulus of the membrane and increase the headgroup hydration layer thickness [100]. This combination imparts air stability to the membrane. The PEG layer has also been shown to have a negligible effect on the binding of modest-sized analyte proteins to ligands presented within the lipid bilayer.",

Very recently, Granick and coworkers showed that phospholipid bilayers on mica surfaces would resist cracking upon cooling into the gel phase when positively charged lipids were added to dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles [102]. They argued that these lipids operate by preventing the reorientation of the phosphatidylcholine dipole that normally takes place as the membrane freezes.",

While solid supported phospholipid bilayers are somewhat limited in terms of their substrate compatibility, their major disadvantage is that the supported membrane is not truly decoupled from the underlying substrate. Indeed, the system may not prevent transmembrane proteins from interacting unfavorably with the underlying substrate. Such interactions with the surface can cause proteins in the membrane to become immobile and hinder their function.",

Another formation method involves Langmuir\u2013Blodgett transfer [109]. Two general methods exist for applying the phospholipid leaflet to the SAM covered surface: vesicle fusion and lipid transfer from an air\u2013water interface [110]. Vesicles in aqueous buffer have been shown to spontaneously fuse to the hydrophobic surface of supported lipid monolayers [79] and alkanethiol SAMs [32]. The process of vesicle fusion to such surfaces has been investigated by surface plasmon resonance [111], cyclic voltammetry, and impedance spectroscopy [112]. Alternatively, a phospholipid monolayer can be transferred from the air\u2013water interface to the hydrophobic surface of an alkanethiol SAM [113].

The design of systems for the support of phospholipid bilayers requires careful consideration of the balancing of surface forces [20]. In physisorbed systems, weak interactions between the phospholipid bilayer and the polymer support can result in an unstable system. This may be overcome by first covalently attaching the polymer layer to the substrate. Next, anchor lipids or alkyl side chains capable of inserting into the phospholipid bilayer are employed. These effectively tether the membrane to the underlying polymer layer. In general, it is desirable for the polymer support to be soft, hydrophilic, not too highly charged, and not extensively cross-linked [20].",

Two classes of polymer, polyelectrolytes and lipopolymers, are emerging as popular choices for cushion material. In the case of polyelectrolyte cushions, the material can be directly adsorbed from solution to a variety of substrates by means of layer-by-layer deposition, providing a great deal of control over the resulting film thickness. Polyethylenimine (PEI) has been used to support phospholipid bilayers on mica [124] and quartz [118], [120]. On metallic substrates such as gold, polyelectrolytes can be adsorbed to charged SAMs. Mercaptoundecanoic acid on gold is capable of adsorbing alternating layers of polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) and polystyrene sulfonate sodium salt (PSS) for use as a polymer cushion [21], [121].",

Electrostatic attraction between the substrate and polymer cushion binds the polymer layer to the substrate. In turn, van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, as well as electrostatic interactions bond the lipid layer to the polymer. When a polyelectrolyte layer is deposited onto a substrate, charge on the surface builds up repelling additional material with the same charge away from the interface. Under appropriate deposition conditions, a highly uniform film is built with a linear relationship between thickness and the number of adsorbed layers [125]. On the other hand, the necessity of using electrostatic charges to keep polyelectrolyte cushions in place does present certain limitations. Too much charge can adversely affect the function and mobility of membrane constituents and alter interactions between proteins and the supporting cushion. The strength of the attractive forces is also directly affected by the solution environment; namely ionic strength and pH. This can be problematic, as important biological processes occur in different solution environments.",

            "text": "Lipopolymers are another popular class of polymer cushion. They consist of a soft hydrophilic polymer layer presenting lipid-like molecules at their surface which can insert into a phospholipid membrane and tether it to the polymer spacer. Tethering has the advantage of being much less affected by solution conditions such as pH and ionic strength. However, a large degree of tethering can interfere with the mobility of the individual components within the supported membrane [28]. Typically, the lipopolymer is covalently bonded to the substrate. This provides additional support for the membrane system. Attachment of a lipopolymer to a substrate has been carried out via photoreactive coupling [22], [23], [28], sulfur\u2013metal bond formation [27], [29], [30], epoxy group linkage [23], or silane bonding [123]. Some common polymer backbones used in the synthesis of lipopolymers are, acrylamide [19], [27], [30], ethyloxazoline [22], [28], peptides [126] and ethyleneglycol [123]. It is important that the polymer cushion have the ability to swell in an aqueous environment and have minimal disruptive interactions with the bilayer and any other reconstituted membrane components [20]. The degree to which a polymer cushion swells in an aqueous or humid environment is a good indication of its ability to be employed as a support. It has been observed that the quality of the supported membrane can also be affected by the degree of swelling of the polymer layer prior to bilayer deposition [118]. Swelling is typically monitored in a home-built humidity chamber and can easily be detected with ellipsometry [23] or surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy [22].",

Ligand\u2013receptor binding of biotin-presenting vesicles to streptavidin monolayers followed by PEG-facilitated vesicle fusion has been suggested to provide a supported bilayer with a protein cushion [37]. Similarly, transmembrane proteins can be anchored to substrates via streptavidin\u2013biotin binding [129] or through the use of His-tag binding to a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) complex [128]. Following this anchoring step, a lipid bilayer can be back filled around the suspended transmembrane proteins through in situ dialysis, whereby lipid material is deposited and the surfactant required to solubilize the transmembrane proteins is removed [128]. A schematic diagram of this process is shown in Fig. 10\n. Through genetic engineering, the transmembrane protein can be anchored at precise locations in order to control protein orientation within the membrane.",

The fabrication of such arrays is typically carried out by contact printing with a quill pin type printer or by non-contact printing with a piezoelectric print head where small quantities of sample are propelled to the surface. Samples are generally printed from organic solvents onto a reactive surface or one that has a strong nonspecific affinity for the printed molecules. The advantage of such systems is that once a sample is spotted, it can dry on the surface with little or no negative consequences. This is not the case with phospholipid bilayer systems. In order to retain the desired supramolecular structure, a supported phospholipid bilayer must remain hydrated at all times. This creates a significant challenge for fabricating arrays of supported phospholipid bilayers.",

A typical formation procedure involved the patterning of photoresist on fused quartz wafers by means of standard photolithographic techniques. SUVs were then fused onto the substrate between the barriers, creating a lithographically patterned array of essentially identical planar supported phospholipid membranes. Each membrane was confined within its own two-dimensional corral. The bilayers retained two-dimensional fluidity within a given corral, but the barriers did not allow mixing between neighboring patches as was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy [13], [130]. Limited differentiation between the bilayers could be achieved by selective photobleaching [131]. Fig. 11\na illustrates the process of forming compositional patterns by photobleaching [132].",

The corrals could then be sequentially backfilled with SUVs containing egg-PC or other chemically relevant species. Fig. 11b illustrates the process of forming composition arrays by microcontact printing [132]. This could potentially be a rapid means of producing arrays which vary in the composition of a few components, although the ability to create multi-component patterns is limited. Another means of microcontact printing bilayer arrays utilizes a stamp fabricated out of agarose [145]. Using this method Majd and Mayer were able to print membrane arrays of one composition at the 200 micron scale and multi-component arrays on the one millimeter scale (Fig. 14\n). In this case spatial addressing was achieved by hand pipetting different SUV solutions to different regions of the agarose stamp. It may be possible, however, to reduce the size of the printed spots if robotic addressing is employed. This method is particularly useful in printing at least 100 copies of the same array with a single inking of the stamp [145].",

The removal process could be observed in real time by fluorescence microscopy over the course of approximately 90 minutes. Almost all of the displaced phospholipid material formed vesicles in the bulk solution and could be easily rinsed away. The bulk solution in each microcompartment could subsequently be individually addressed.

It involves the use of a small carbon fiber that has been coated with bovine serum album (BSA) to separate a surface immobilized giant unilaminar vesicle (GUV) into two vesicles through homofission by depressing the carbon fiber through the GUV [151]. The two vesicles, which are connected by a nanotube of phospholipid material from the vesicles, can then be separated by a lateral motion of the carbon fiber.

Penetration and removal of a GUV by the micropipet tip results in phospholipid nanotube formation when performed in aqueous solution. Applying pressure with the micropipet tip inflates a vesicle on the end of the nanotube, which can then be placed at the desired location. This process can be repeated several times, constructing a complex network. The last vesicle is removed from the tip by application of mechanical force and applied DC voltage pulses. This method can also be used to inject materials into the NVN. To do this, the micropipet tip is filled with the solution that is to be injected into the NVN and used to form a vesicle connected by a nanotube to the network. If this vesicle is released into solution instead of being immobilized first, it will be drawn back by surface tension and release its contents within the NVN [154].",

First, a GUV presenting biotin at its surface is suctioned into a micropipet tip. Next a small vesicle is formed at the tip of the micropipet by applying a positive pressure. Finally, this vesicle is brought into contact with one of the micropatterned gold circles. The ligand\u2013receptor interaction of neutravidin and biotin is strong enough to hold the vesicle in place while the micropipet is translated away from the first vesicle, drawing with it a phospholipid nanotube.

Such a possibility is quite important as approximately half of all known drug targets are membrane associated proteins [157]. Combining microfluidic platforms and array-based systems with current advances in solid supports for phospholipid membranes should enable a multitude of sensing applications. For example, these platforms could provide valuable information for the development of early warning sensors for biological warfare agents, the discovery of novel drugs, and therapeutic methods for combating, not only viral diseases such as AIDS, influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), but also neural degenerative diseases from Alzheimer\u2019s to Parkinson\u2019s.",
