The first group of children had respiratory specimens submitted to the Clinical Virology Laboratory, Yale\u2013New Haven Hospital (New Haven, Connecticut). These respiratory specimens (nasal swabs, respiratory secretions, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples) were submitted to the Clinical Virology Laboratory from 1 January 2004 through 31 December 2004 and were stored at \u221220\u00b0C after the addition of an equal volume of \u201cviral freezing media\u201d (2\u00d7 Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle medium, 200 mmol/L MgS04, and 100 mmol/L HEPES [pH 7.5]). Specimens originated from children seen in the emergency department, inpatient wards, intensive care units, and the hospital-affiliated outpatient urgent care clinic and were submitted at the discretion of the medical teams. These specimens tested negative for RSV, parainfluenza viruses (types 1\u20133), influenza A and B viruses, and adenovirus by means of direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA). The second group of children was comprised of asymptomatic control subjects who were seen at the Yale\u2013New Haven Hospital Pediatric Primary Care Center for routine well-child visits. Nasal wash specimens, obtained after the parent or guardian of the child provided written, informed consent, were collected according to standard protocols [10] and were stored at \u221220\u00b0C after the addition of an equal volume of viral freezing media",

The primers used in the screening of the respiratory specimens were identical to those described elsewhere by Allander et al. [5]. The forward primer 5\u2032-GACCTCTGTAAGTACTATTAC-3\u2032 and the reverse primer 5\u2032-CTCTGTGTTGACTGAATACAG-3\u2032 target a portion of the HBoV NP-1 gene and produce a 354-bp amplicon that corresponds to nt 2351\u20132704 of the HBoV genome (GenBank accession number DQ000495). PCR amplification cycles were performed at 95\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 54\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min, and then by a final extension cycle at 72\u00b0C for 10 min [5]. Each set of PCRs contained appropriate negative controls. The authenticity of each amplicon was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For phylogenetic analysis, regions of the VP1/VP2 genes were amplified and sequenced. The forward primer 5\u2032-GGACCACAGTCATCAGAC-3\u2032 and the reverse primer 5\u2032-CCACTACCATCGGGCTG-3\u2032 target nt 4370\u20134387 and nt 5172\u20135189, respectively, of the HBoV genome, and PCR amplification yields a predicted amplicon of 819 bases. The PCR amplification cycle that was used is the same as the one outlined above. Each HBoV-positive specimen was screened for human metapneumovirus by reverse-transcriptase PCR [11]",

All but one of the 22 HBoV-positive children tested negative for other respiratory viruses. Although the DFA and PCR screening tests that were used do not screen for all known respiratory viruses (such common viruses as rhinoviruses and coronaviruses were not included in the screening), and although the sensitivity of DFA for adenovirus is only 70% (one child whose respiratory specimen ultimately tested positive for adenovirus in cell culture was found to be negative for adenovirus by DFA), it is unlikely that another respiratory virus was present in 21 HBoV-positive specimens. Furthermore, none of the 96 asymptomatic children who had screening performed tested positive for HBoV. One potential explanation for the absence of HBoV in the asymptomatic children was that those children were selected and underwent screening during months (May to September) of the year-long study period in which HBoV apparently was not circulating. However, this was not the case. The respiratory specimens of 82.3% of asymptomatic children were collected in January\u2013April and in October\u2013December, the months during which HBoV was detected in specimens collected from symptomatic children",

However, there are potential benefits to this approach. Screening is not limited to hospitalized children, as has been the case in other studies of HBoV infection [5]. Because respiratory specimens are often collected and screened for reasons other than the detection of respiratory tract disease (e.g., for the identification of the source of a fever), other manifestations of HBoV-associated disease not limited to the respiratory tract may be detected. Indeed, 5 of the HBoV-positive children had diarrhea, and 3 of these 5 children (2 children were hospitalized) had viral gastroenteritis diagnosed. Our study was not designed to evaluate the potential role of HBoV in gastrointestinal disease. However, both bovine parvovirus and minute virus of canines, the other 2 members of the genus Bocavirus (HBoV is the third member of this genus), cause enteric disease in their natural host [12, 13]. The potential role of HBoV in enteric disease will require further investigation",

All of the HBoV-positive specimens were collected in fall, winter, and early spring (although only a relatively few specimens obtained in July and August were screened, and, therefore, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about seasonality from our data ). Nonetheless, this finding is in agreement with the findings of other studies of HBoV. In the 1-year study by Allander et al. [5], 16 of the 17 HBoV-positive specimens were collected from December 2003 through April 2004. Of the 18 HBoV-positive specimens identified in a Japanese study, 17 were collected from January through May [9]. Likewise, HBoV was detected in Australian children during the fall and winter months [8]. Erythema infectiosum (i.e., fifth disease), caused by parvovirus B19 (which, before the discovery of HBoV, was the only known human parvovirus to be associated with a specific disease), is also seasonal, although occurrence of the disease peaks in the spring and summer [14]",

Rare nucleotide changes were observed in NP-1, and none of these polymorphisms resulted in amino acid changes. On the basis of the sequencing of 2 isolates, Allander et al. [5] found that nucleotide polymorphisms were most common in the VP1/VP2 gene of HBoV. Therefore, we hypothesized that sequencing of the VP1/VP2 gene of the New Haven isolates would allow for the most robust phylogenetic analysis. We sequenced the VP1/VP2 gene of \u223c50% of the isolates and found that the majority of nucleotide changes occurred in the 3\u2032 third of the VP1/VP2 cassette. Therefore, we sequenced the 3\u2032 third of the VP1/VP2 gene of all New Haven isolates. Although nucleotide polymorphisms were infrequent, there appeared to be at least 2 strains of HBoV circulating. A polymorphism in VP1/VP2 was observed at nt 4823 in the HBoV genome. This polymorphism resulted in either a serine or a threonine in the predicted amino acid sequence. This polymorphism was also present in ST1 and ST2, the original isolates identified by Allander et al. [5]. Our findings indicate that the 2 genotypes of HBoV identified in New Haven are remarkably similar to the genotypes of the initial strains of HBoV identified in Sweden, and this suggests that the nucleotide sequences (of the NP-1 and VP1/VP2 genes, at least) are highly conserved among viruses circulating in different locations",
