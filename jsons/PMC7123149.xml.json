The median length of stay in hospital is 3 days [4]. HF is one of the most common diseases affecting adults in Europe today. In Germany, for example, HF is reported to be the most common diagnosis leading to hospitalization. In persons aged 20\u201340 years, the prevalence is under 0.5%, however in persons over age 60 years, the prevalence reaches as high as 10% in men and 8% in women [5].

An increase in ventricular inotropy as a result of a sudden increase in afterload, known as the Anrep effect, is mediated through changes in calcium dynamics and occurs by maintaining the adrenergic state. Catecholamines also contribute to the increase in RV pressure by increasing the inotropy. With a further increase in the afterload, the subsequent dilated RV relies on the Frank-Starling mechanism to function. However, when all of the adaptive mechanisms in response to pressure overload are exhausted, the systemic pressure begins to fall, with a sudden, dramatic, and irreversible decrease in the contractile function of the RV. This concept was first demonstrated in 1954 by Guyton et al. in which it was established that a steady rise in the pressure of the RV secondary to the progressive constriction of the main pulmonary artery to the point where the RV can no longer compensate would lead to a sudden decrease in systemic pressure and cardiac output [9].",

Pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease and anatomic severity of the obstruction influence the cascading events seen in pulmonary thromboembolism. As vasoconstrictive factors are released from the thrombus and in response to hypoxia, the pulmonary vascular resistance increases, with subsequent increase in pulmonary artery pressure. The result is a dilated and hypokinetic RV. The myocardial oxygen demand increase and eventually leads to myocardial ischemia or infarction [2]. Ischemia or infarction then causes both a decrease in RV ejection and a septal shift, thereby reducing the LV preload.

The\nadaptive response of the RV to pressure overload is myocardial hypertrophy and a change in shape from the normal conformation to a spherical geometry. This is a result of increased protein synthesis and increase in cell size. Paracrine, autocrine, and neurohormonal signals such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and enhanced sympathetic activity, as well as stretch, induce protein synthesis. The long term effect causes the pressure overload to eventually decrease the cardiac contractile force. The accompanying extracellular matrix synthesis impacts the RV function and morphology, thus leading to electrical instability [2]. The adaptive mechanism of the RV in chronic pressure overload due to congenital heart disease, where the RV shape is concentric with preserved function, is attributed to persistent expression of fetal genes [8].",
