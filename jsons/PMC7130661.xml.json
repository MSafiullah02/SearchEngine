Widespread cellular debris, inflammatory cells and fibrin could cause airway obstruction and the development of mucus plugs that can partially or totally occlude the bronchioli. A \u201cball-valve\u201d mechanism induces air trapping in the respiratory tract distal to the partially occluded bronchioli, and atelectasis when the bronchioli are completely occluded [30]. Because the bronchiolar smooth muscles have a minor role in obstruction, bronchodilator therapy achieves a limited benefit in acute bronchiolitis [28]. Atelectasis and air trapping cause an altered ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratio [28] clinically resulting in hypoxemia and increased CO2.",

In the USA, the introduction of routine measurement of oxygen saturations led to a 2.5-fold increase in hospitalizations for bronchiolitis without any significant change in mortality. Hence there is probably little to be gained in administering oxygen to infants with oxygen saturations of greater than 90% in the absence of respiratory distress.

This device can deliver oxygen heated, humidified and at high flow (up to 8 L/min) with nasal cannulas, and supplies oxygen mixtures containing a known inspired O2 concentration (from 21% to 100%). HFNC has the advantage that O2 flow can be set to values greater than the child's inspiratory peak. This adjustment minimizes inhaled ambient air, and maintains a constant FiO2. Equally important, high flows, humidified and heated oxygen minimize the adverse effects related to inhaling cold and anhydrous gas (mucosal dehydration, reduced ciliary clearance, increased bronchobstructive stimulus). Finally, the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) effect, caused by high flow gases, keeps the airway patent in all respiration phases. The efficiency of HFNC depends on cannulae adhesion to the nostrils, and an adequate flow setting according to the patients. In infants with severe respiratory distress, PO2\n < 60 mm Hg and PCO2\n > 50 mm Hg, or in infants with apnea, CPAP is indicated [15].",

Many studies showed that infants with early and severe bronchiolitis needing hospital admission (about 50%), are at significantly higher risk for both recurrent wheeze and subsequent asthma [49] in later years. This correlation can be explained by the combined factors related to viral pathogenic role, host genetic predisposition, and environmental factors. The viral role implicates multiple mechanisms. First, infection might cause direct damage to the respiratory epithelium, in incompletely developed lungs [50]. Equally well known is the crucial role of viral infections in asthma exacerbations by altering the Th1/Th2 response. Viruses can also activate specific molecular pathways that induce the synthesis of many factors that regulate remodeling and alveolar development (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), nitric oxide (NO), transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF), amphiregulin and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)). Viral infection seems also to upregulate neurotrophins, substances that can remodel neuronal connections, thus promoting non-specific bronchial hyperresponsivity [51], [52], [53].",

We observed that infants with RSV bronchiolitis (41.2%) were younger, had been breastfed for a shorter time and had a more severe bronchiolitis with prevalent diffuse air trapping on the chest X-ray. Conversely, infants with hBoV bronchiolitis (12.2%) were the oldest, had been breastfed for longer and had a mild clinical form with patchy infiltrates on the chest X-ray. Conversely, infants with RV bronchiolitis (8.8%) had moderately severe bronchiolitis, and more frequently had a family history for atopy and higher blood eosinophil counts than the other infants.

We also confirmed a higher blood eosinophil count, a lower blood CRP concentration and fewer radiologically-documented lung consolidations in infants with recurrent wheezing than in non-wheezing infants [74]. These results receive support from other studies [75], [76]. Particularly the COAST (Childhood Origins of Asthma) study, started in 1998, investigated the interaction between genetic predisposition to the development of atopic diseases, viral infections and environmental factors in a cohort of 289 newborns with a high risk for allergic diseases. They showed that the combination of genetic predisposition (family history for atopy), and RV-induced wheezing before the age of three years was associated with a higher risk of asthma developing at the age of 6 years [75].",

In a study designed to investigate the balance between type 1 and type 2 immune response to RV, Papadopoulos et al. found that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) incubated with RV from atopic subjects produced interleukin-10 whereas PBMCs from nonatopic subjects produced interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-12. This defective type 1 immune response to RV in predisposed patients with asthma may contribute to the development of acute asthma exacerbation by promoting type 2 inflammation and diminishing viral clearance through deficient type 1 antiviral immune response [84].",

Long-standing evidence underlines the correlation between bronchiolitis and wheezing bronchitis. Although RSV remains the most common pathogen associated with bronchiolitis emerging evidence documents RV as risk factor for the subsequent wheezing bronchitis. The precise mechanism predisposing children to wheezing remains controversial. To answer this question research efforts should now switch from RSV to RV.",
