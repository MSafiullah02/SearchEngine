All of these factors can significantly impact physical and mental wellbeing. According to a survey performed by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (Beijing, China), many people experienced negative emotions, including fear, anxiety, depression, during the COVID-19 outbreak; this is important because excessive negative emotions can lead to somatic symptoms that in turn cause significant physical and mental discomfort. Without appropriate intervention, psychosomatic disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), may occur; these can seriously impact mental and physical health. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate concerns among the general population regarding COVID-19 and somatic symptoms, to provide reference data for practical and effective psychological interventions.",

The Somatic Self-rating Scale (SSS) was designed by Mao Jialiang of the Department of Cardiology, Shanghai Renji Hospital (Shanghai, China). The test-retest reliability of the SSS was 0.96 and the Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficients was 0.89. The correlation coefficients of the four factors with the total scale score ranged from 0.76 to 0.88, the correlation coefficients of the four factors ranged from 0.56 to 0.70. Correlations with Zung's Scales were in range of 0.74 to 0.80 while the four factors were in range of 0.55 to 0.74. Drawing the ROC curve and the area under the curve was 0.841. The SSS includes 20 items (scored from 1-4) that cover somatic, anxiety, depression and mixed anxiety-depression symptoms. The score for mixed anxiety-depression symptoms is based on the individual anxiety and depression scores. The SSS has shown good reliability and validity in previous studies (Zuoji, 2005; Li et al., 2008; Zhuang et al., 2010) .",

Especially during the early stage of the pandemic, many stores in China were selling masks, alcohol and other products relevant to prevention and control of the virus, but may be in short supply. This may have caused the students to worry about the threat to life and health posed by COVID-19, thus exacerbating overall psychological distress and somatic symptoms.

While an appropriate level of stress can improve the body's resistance and serves as a defense mechanism, when stress is out of control, the autonomic nervous system and cortex are negatively affected; this can lead to psychosomatic and somatic symptoms and, in turn, to psychological problems and mental illness (Xiang et al., 2020) . This survey found that stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic manifested differently in college and primary school students, likely due to differences in their social experiences and sources of support. Government and relevant agencies should implement different measures to safeguard the mental and psychological health of particular groups. Response mode could be incorporated into mental health interventions, which should principally be aimed at stabilizing the emotional state but must also emphasize aspects of social policy (Xiao and Zhang, 2020) .
