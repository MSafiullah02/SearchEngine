Integrated optical sensors16, especially the interferometric ones that have been developed in recent years, such as the Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI)17 and the Young interferometer 18\u201321, show an extremely high refractive index resolution in the range of 10?7\n?10?8 RIU (refractive index units) 17, 21, which is equivalent to detection of a protein mass coverage of ?30 fg/mm2. Furthermore, the IO readout systems are robust and small, allowing for miniaturization where many elements of the device can be integrated in a single chip occupying a relatively small area. These features offer the prospect for development of multisensing systems. Furthermore, this implies an increase of the analysis throughput, a reduction in the consumption of biomaterials, and cost reduction. Moreover, the optical-based sensors are label free sensing techniques, which require less complex sample preparation, do not need special laboratories and skilled personnel, and result in lower test costs. An additional advantage is that usually a simpler and faster signal analysis can be achieved.",

In Fig. 10.2, a schematic layout of a two-channel IO YI is shown. Light is coupled into an IO channel waveguide and split by a Y-junction to two parallel output channels positioned at a certain distance from each other, as shown in Fig. 10.2. An interference pattern is generated as a result of the overlap of both outgoing divergent beams. The interference pattern is recorded by a CCD camera, which is placed at a given distance from the endface of the integrated chip. A sensing window is realized on the top of the core layer of the measuring channel where the samples to be analyzed are applied. When a binding event takes place on the sensing window of the measuring channel a phase change between reference and measuring channels occurs and the interference pattern will be shifted with respect to the camera surface. By measuring the spatial shift of the interference pattern, the phase change can be calculated, yielding an accurate determination of the refractive index change occurring on the sensing window of the measuring channel.\n",

The single mode character is important as different modes are affected differently by refractive index changes due to, e.g., analyte concentration changes. This will strongly complicate the signal analysis. Coupling of the light to the channel waveguide is achieved by very efficient fiber-to-chip coupling17, which results in a robust device. Alternative coupling schemes such as end-fire coupling38 or grating coupling39 may also be applied. For optimal fiber-to-chip coupling adiabatic transition from the channel waveguide end-face cross-section to the cross-section of the common waveguide requires transverse adiabatic tapers, which have a small taper angle (<0.030) to have functional tapering losses <0.1 dB40. The distances between the four channels are chosen such that all six possible distances between a set of two channels are distinct in order to allow independent measurements of phase differences (see discussion in Sect. 10.2.2). Furthermore, the distances are chosen such that (a) a reasonable number (>2) of fringes are visible at the CCD interface (the channels should not be too close) and (b) there is a good overlap of the light from the different channels at the surface of the CCD (the channels should not be too far apart). Although the distances are not device-critical, it is important to take these considerations into account for an optimal device design.",

It should be note, however, that the used antigen concentrations were below the saturation value. The use of higher concentrations of HSA yielded slightly better results (ratio ?0.3) indicating that there is still room for improvement. In addition, physical adsorption was used for immobilization of antibodies as an alternative to a pA-modified surface.

Examples of recent viral outbreaks are H5N1 avian influenza and SARS. The extent of a viral outbreak depends, among other things, on currently available diagnostic capabilities. Existing methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR)47, branched-chain DNA (bDNA) tests48, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)49 are very sensitive, but have some major drawbacks. These techniques are very labor-intensive and require time-consuming sample preparation procedures. Therefore these techniques may have limited use for rapid responses in case of serious viral outbreaks. This drawback has motivated the development of many alternative techniques that may overcome the limitations of the existing methods. Among these, label-free detection schemes such as Raman50, 51, rupture event scanning52, nanowires53, microring resonators10, and cantilever based techniques54, 55 are among the most promising. The YI sensor described here also is a good candidate for rapid viral detection.",

The results as shown in Fig. 4.4b, clearly demonstrates the feasibility to detect the binding of HSV-1 in the presence of serum. The observed phase change is in good agreement with the measurement of HSV-1 in buffer as indicated in Fig.10.16a. To further confirm the specificity of HSV-1\u2013?-HSV-1 gG interaction, a control experiment in which no antibody was immobilized in the measuring channel was performed. No response was measured when the virus solution in serum was applied (graph not shown), indicating the specificity of HSV-1\u2013?-HSV-1 gG interaction.

Furthermore, even at the lowest measured virus concentration (850 particles/ml) a high signal-to-noise ratio of 2 \u00d7 102 (at a bandwidth of 0.1 Hz) is achieved. Therefore it is predicted that the current YI sensor is able to detect even much lower concentrations.

This results in a phase change of ?1.1 \u00d7 10?4 fringes ?for the binding of a single virus particle. From this estimation it is derived that for the lowest measured concentration ?700 virus particles were detected with an average binding rate of 1 virus every 4 s.

A major advantage of the microfluidic system over the cuvette system is, apart from the improved robustness of the sensor, the strongly enhanced time-response of the sensor. Experiments on monitoring the antihuman serum albumin/human serum albumin immunoreaction show that the response time of the sensor of 100 s achieved with a bulky cuvette, is reduced to 4 s (at similar sample flow). This improvement is due to the much smaller dimensions of the microfluidic channels compared to those of the cuvette. Reduced dimensions, especially the height of the flow channel, imply higher flow velocities at the sample-sensor surface interface and shorter diffusion times of molecules/analytes. Both aspects improve the time-response of the sensor. In addition the total sample volume required is also strongly reduced from the sub-ml to the ?l range.\n",

The sensor signal should only be sensitive to the binding of the analyte of interest and not to other molecules or viruses in the sample. Therefore it is extremely important that these types of sensors are tested with clinically relevant samples. Specificity of the sensor thus strongly depends on the \u201cchemical\u201d coating of the sensor surface. The use of a pA-based coating was used to successfully detect HSV-1 viruses in human blood serum (this work) at clinically relevant concentrations. More recently it was shown that tuberculosis-specific antibodies can be detected with a YI sensor in undiluted human blood serum39. The availability of antibodies with high-specificity and low crossreactivity for relevant antigens, combined with these results suggest that YI-based sensors can combine very high sensitivity with good specificity and therefore provide a solid foundation for further development of YI sensors for clinical diagnostic assays.",
