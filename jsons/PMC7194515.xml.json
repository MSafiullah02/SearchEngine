            "text": "Along with the outbreak of the epidemic of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the number of older patients infected with COVID-19 was increasing in the world and it brought a serious threat to life and health. A study in the New English Journal of Medicine (NEJM) by Guan reported the clinical characteristics of coronavirus diseases 2019 in China that the rate of older patients older than 65 years with COVID-19 infection was 15.1 % (Guan et al., 2020), while the proportion of older than 80 years was 3 % reported in the JAMA by Wu and McGoogan (Wu & McGoogan, 2020). It was proved that population including old people was generally susceptible, and the older patients with high infection rate and fatality (Yang, Yu et al., 2020). Unfortunately, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in older patients is unknown. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report, as of March 3, 2020, a total of 90,870 cases with laboratory-confirmed with COVID-19 infection have been detected in the world (WHO, 2020). As a new disease and a new global health issue, COVID-19 infection is understandable that its emergence and spread cause anxiety and fear among the older population. In addition, aging population has been one of the largest problems in many countries, and there were a higher prevalence of multimorbidity and lower resistance in older patients (Feng, Liu, Guan, & Mor, 2012; Low et al., 2019), no doubt, there are many old people who will face the risk of infected with COVID-19 with the globalization and aging population, which imposing a heavy burden on the public and health care systems in the world. Furthermore, the clinical clues that an infection might be present in an older person include fever and some obvious clinical signs, such as fever, cough, and rales, the elder patients may have typical or atypical presentations of infection as that described by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) (High et al., 2009), how about the COVID-19 infection? Given that, we collected the data on the 60 older patients infected with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, described and analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the older patients with COVID-19 infection.",

A confirmed case was defined as a suspected cases with the laboratory test for the 2019-nCoV virus from the respiratory specimens show positive result by means of real-time reverse-transcription-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay, while a suspected case was defined as a case that fulfilled both the following criteria: clinical have fever, radiographic evidence of pneumonia, low or normal white-cell count or low lymphocyte count; and the epidemic history have a travel to Wuhan or direct contact with patients from Wuhan who have fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days before illness according to the new coronavirus pneumonial diagnosis and treatment program (3id ed.) which were published by the National Health Commission of China. A mild case was defined as a confirmed case with fever, respiratory symptoms and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. While a severe case was defined as a mild cases with dyspnea or respiratory failure. Only laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection was enrolled in this study, laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was detected in the first admission hospital and verified by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We collected the data on the demographic, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory tests, diagnosis types, cluster cases and outcomes of COVID-19 infection in elderly patients, and categorized into three groups and compared the difference between middle aged 50\u201364years, aged 65\u201379 years and older than 80 years. If the data we need was missing, we directly communicated with EMS providers.",

Older people are more susceptible to a variety of diseases than younger, of course, including COVID-19 infection, which could dramatically increased the healthcare burden under the background of an aging society (Kingston, Robinson, Booth, Knapp, & Jagger, 2018; Rasmussen et al., 2017). The entire population is susceptible to the COVID-19, and the confirmed patients, asymptomatic carrier and people in the incubation period are contagious, it is difficult to control source of infection (Yang & Duan, 2020), and most of the adult patients were old people, who had higher morbidity and case-fatality rate (Sun, Lu, Xu, Sun, & Pan, 2020). However, the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in older patients were not reported currently. In this study, to our knowledge, we firstly described and analyzed the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the older patients with COVID-19 infection and compared the difference between aged 50\u201364 years, aged 65\u201379 years and older than 80 years groups in Beijing.",

Existing research found that the overall fatality rate of infected COVID-19 was estimated 2 %\u20135 % (Elisabeth, 2020; Ji, Ma, Maikel, & Pan, 2020; Sun, Qie et al., 2020; Wu, Chen, & Chan, 2020; Wu & McGoogan, 2020;), however, the case-fatality rate were 8.0 % and 14.8 % in aged 70\u201379 years and older than 80 years patients respectively (Wu & McGoogan, 2020). The case-fatality rate was 18.8 % of older than 80 years patients in our study, and higher than it mentioned in previous study, which was mainly for the older patients got the more underlying diseases as a result of the weaker immune functions. When old populations were infected with COVID-19, prompting administration of antibiotics to prevent infection and strengthening of immune support treatment might reduce the case-fatality rate (Chen et al., 2020).",

Multiple factors lead to a higher proportion of elderly patients with severe situation, such as senior, comorbidities, low immune functions and so on. There is no doubt that old severe patients are more likely to die, therefore, the clinical treatment capacity need to improve to decrease the case-fatality rate of severe patients with COVID-19 infection, and the elderly should be pay special attention. There was a 65-year-old man who was afebrile and well, and noteworthy, he was an asymptomatic case, which is one of the particular features of our study. The proportion of contacted to symptomatic case in 14 days was significantly higher in aged older than 80 years group compared with the aged 65\u201379 years group in our study, which owing to the aged older than 80 years elderly were mostly accompanied by their families. Familial cluster of infected with COVID-19 have been reported in homes, especially without obvious symptoms. If the asymptomatic and mild cases cannot be found or ignored, they will spread the virus to others quickly. Therefore, to identify and control the infected cases, as well as early quarantine for their close contacts, especially in families are important measures to prevent transmission of the COVID-19 infection in older population.",
