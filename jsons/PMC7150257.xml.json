However, mild hyperbilirubinaemia may occur in horses that are anorexic, regardless of the cause. An increase in direct bilirubin of 25% or more of the total bilirubin is suggestive of a predominant biliary disease. Clinically evident jaundice associated with marked unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia but in the absence of other biochemical evidence of liver disease is suggestive of haemolytic anaemia. Septic foals with intestinal ileus sometimes have elevations in direct bilirubin with minimal evidence of hepatocellular dysfunction; treatment should focus on the sepsis and intestinal ileus.\u2022There may be a decrease in blood urea nitrogen and albumin with chronic liver diseases.\u2022Serum or plasma bile acids are elevated in horses with both hepatocellular and hepatobiliary disorders, and elevations can be an early predictor of liver failure when values rise above 30 \u00b5mol/L. Unlike for other species, fasting samples are not required in horses to interpret bile acid results, although mild elevations of bile acids (up to 20 \u00b5mol/L) may occur as a result of anorexia.\u2022Blood ammonia can also be used as an assessment of liver function. However, rapid and careful sample handling is required. Ideally a control sample should be obtained from a healthy horse and measured simultaneously for comparative purposes.\u2022Dye excretion tests (such as bromosulphophthalein and indocyanine green) are now very rarely used to assess liver function.\n3.Other analytes may be altered in hepatic disease, e.g. hypoglycaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, decreased albumin: globulin ratio, and raised concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterol.4.Clotting function \u2013 prolonged prothrombin time.

The portal veins can be distinguished from the hepatic veins by the greater amount of fibrous tissue in the walls of the portal vessels. Bile ducts are not visible in the normal liver.

Treatment is most likely to be successful in acute hepatic failure and is not indicated in horses with severely cirrhotic livers. The prognosis is poor for severe hepatoencephalopathy.\u2022Sedation may be necessary in horses with signs of hepatoencephalopathy. Xylazine or detomidine administered in small doses is usually effective. Doses of sedatives that cause lowering of the head should be avoided if possible as low-head position and hypoventilation may worsen cerebral oedema. Phenobarbital can be used, but diazepam should be avoided since it may worsen hepatoencephalopathy.\u2022Intravenous fluids are probably the most important component of treatment for acute liver disease and hepatic encephalopathy. The intravenous fluids should consist of a balanced electrolyte solution, preferably without lactate, and should be supplemented with potassium 20\u201340 mEq/L, and 5\u201310 grams of dextrose per 100 mL. Sodium bicarbonate should be given only if blood pH is less than 7.1 and/or bicarbonate is less than 14 mEq/L. Additional potassium may be given as potassium chloride mixed in molasses and administered per os via a dose syringe. Fresh frozen plasma may be used, but hetastarch or stored whole blood should be avoided.\u2022Attempts should be made to decrease blood ammonia concentration.\u25aa\nMineral oil is administered by nasogastric tube.\u25aa\nNeomycin can be administered at 5.0 mg/kg every 8 hours orally by dose syringe for 2 days.\u25aa\nLactulose 0.2\u20130.5 mL/kg every 8\u201312 hours may also decrease ammonia production in the bowel and can be used concurrently with neomycin.

Sorghum and/or cracked corn mixed with molasses or commercially prepared BCAA paste are ideal. Carbohydrates should be fed frequently in small amounts. A grass hay with a moderate amount of protein, rather than alfalfa hay or spring-cut grass, should be fed.\u2022Affected horses should be protected from sunlight to prevent photosensitization.\u2022\nVitamin B\n1, folic acid and vitamin K\n1 should be administered weekly.\u2022\nAnti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-oedema therapy is indicated in acute hepatic failure. The anti-oxidant, anti-oedema treatments include dimethylsulphoxide, acetylcysteine and mannitol given intravenously and vitamin E given intramuscularly. Anti-inflammatory therapy should include flunixin meglumine and pentoxifylline.\u2022\nAntibiotics are indicated in cases of bacterial cholangitis/cholangiotepatitis.\u2022Hyperlipaemia may be treated by administration of insulin and heparin (see Chapter 9).\n",
