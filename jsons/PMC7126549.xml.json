BRMs regulate, among others, the type, duration, and intensity of immune responses and are characterized by pleiotropy and redundancy. The thymic polypeptide prothymosin alpha (proT\u03b1) has been incorporated in the large family of BRMs, mainly because of its modulating effects on several properties of immune effectors. Its wide distribution in cells, tissues, and organs, its broad phylogenetic dissemination and the lack of a mechanism supporting its secretion, questioned the initial characterization of proT\u03b1 as \u201cthymic hormone.\u201d Now, it is widely acknowledged that proT\u03b1 possesses an essential intracellular role related to cell survival and growth, and at the same time, extracellularly it enhances the functionalities of diverse subpopulations of the immune system. Several novel functions, beyond immunomodulation, have also been ascribed to proT\u03b1.",

Although its lymphopoietic role had been repeatedly demonstrated (Miller, 2002), the long-prevailing opinion claimed that the thymus was a redundant organ with no immunological function. It was not until the early 1960s that Miller, Good, and their colleagues tipped the balance in favor of a crucial and central role for thymus in establishing a competent immune system (Good et al., 1962, Miller, 1961). They were the first to show that neonatally thymectomized mice exhibited a marked deficiency of lymphocytes and impaired immune responses that were further associated with their inability to resist infections and reject histoincompatible transplants. However, even these studies could not fully elucidate the exact mechanism underlying the continued thymic control over lymphocytic function. A year later, it was unequivocally proven that the thymus is actually a gland mediating its function, at least partially, through humoral messages and not merely via cellular interactions (Aisenberg and Wilkes, 1965, Levey et al., 1963).",

            "text": "In the years to follow, Goldstein and his colleagues isolated and identified a series of hormonal-like agents with immune-restorative capacity (Goldstein, 2007). These initial efforts led to the isolation of a partially purified thymic extract that could enhance in vivo the incorporation of tritiated thymidine into DNA of mouse lymph nodes, indicative of increased lymphocytic proliferation (Klein, Goldstein, & White, 1965). With the invaluable aid of the newly developed in vitro proliferation assay, this soluble factor inducing lymphocytopoiesis was purified, characterized, and named \u201cthymosin\u201d (Goldstein, Slater, & White, 1966). However, the major breakthrough was the isolation of thymosin fraction V (TFV), a further purified preparation with immunoregulatory activity (Goldstein et al., 1981). Using a novel and complex process that enabled its purification in large amounts (Hooper et al., 1975), TFV's properties and activity were explored in several in vitro and in vivo studies. In vitro, TFV was shown to stimulate lymphocytes deriving from immunosuppressed humans and restore their functions to normal levels (Wara & Ammann, 1975). Additionally, TFV enhanced murine spleen cell responses in mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) and in mixed lymphocyte-tumor cultures (MLTCs; Talmadge, Uithoven, Lenz, & Chirigos, 1984). In vivo, TFV increased the survival of neonatally thymectomized mice (Spangelo, Hall, & Goldstein, 1987), restored graft-vs-host reactivity (Spangelo et al., 1987), and \u201ccorrected\u201d T-cell abnormalities in mice with autoimmune disease (Dauphinee, Tala, Goldstein, & White, 1974). Interestingly, TFV also possessed direct antiproliferative properties against malignant cells, as demonstrated in vitro against murine pituitary adenocarcinoma and glioma (Spangelo, Farrimond, Pompilius, & Bowman, 2000), and against human acute T lymphoblastic (Ho, Ma, Price, Hunstein, & HoVbrand, 1983) and promyelocytic leukemia cell lines (Spangelo et al., 2007). Finally, in vivo treatment with TFV conferred resistance to Dunning (Khaw & Rule, 1973) and murine lymphoblastic leukemias (Petro & Watson, 1982).",

Thorough fractionation and analysis revealed that TFV consisted of at least 40 different molecules, of which 10\u201315 were principal and 20 or more were secondary components, and the majority of these molecules were acidic and of varying molecular weights (between 1000 and 15,000 Da). A nomenclature system based upon the isoelectric point (pI) of the peptides has resulted in TFV's subdivision into three different groups, each one identified by a Greek letter, ie, alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), and gamma (\u03b3). Thus, peptides with pIs less than 5.0 were named \u03b1-peptides, these with pIs of 5.0\u20137.0 were termed \u03b2-peptides, and peptides with pIs greater than 7.0 were considered \u03b3-peptides. A subscript number was used to identify the peptides from each group, indicative of the order in which they were isolated from TFV, eg, \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b13, etc. (Goldstein, 2007).",

Subsequently, a number of \u03b1- and \u03b2-peptides were isolated and sequenced from thymus and other tissues (Hannappel & Huff, 2003). Utilizing a newly developed method that reduced the effect of proteolysis during peptide isolation, Hannappel and colleagues demonstrated that T\u03b24 was the major component of calf thymus extract and that T\u03b11 was absent or present in only trace amounts (Hannappel, Davoust, & Horecker, 1982a). The latter observation led the investigators to hypothesize that the presence of T\u03b11 in TFV was the result of proteolytic cleavage of a precursor peptide. This speculation was further fueled by evidence showing that a previously isolated peptide, T\u03b28, was actually the proteolytic product of a longer molecule, T\u03b29 (Hannappel, Davoust, & Horecker, 1982b). In addition, the same group isolated two peptides from TFV, whose sequence strongly resembled that of T\u03b11. When compared to T\u03b11, one peptide lacked four amino acids at its carboxy (C)-terminus and it was therefore named des-(25\u201328)-T\u03b11, and the second had an additional seven amino acids at its C-terminus, and was given the name T\u03b111 (Caldarella et al., 1983). Consequently, the search for a larger \u03b1-thymosin precursor molecule began.",

Nearly half of the total residues in proT\u03b1 are accounted by glutamic and aspartic acid and, as a result, the molecule acquires a particularly low pI 3.55. Although it was initially referred to as a \u201cthymic hormone,\u201d proT\u03b1 is not solely expressed in the thymus, but detected in all tissues (Haritos, Tsolas, & Horecker, 1984). It is a noticeably conserved polypeptide characterized by a high degree of sequence homology among mammals (Hannappel & Huff, 2003) and overexpressed in cells with increased physiological (eg, young thymus) or abnormal (eg, malignant) proliferative capacity (Haritos, 1987).",

            "text": "As proT\u03b1\u2019s acidic residues are found primarily within the central segment of the polypeptide chain, the molecule has no specific secondary structure and, eventually, adopts a random coil conformation (Gast et al., 1995). However, the possibility that proT\u03b1 acquires a secondary structure upon interaction with other proteins has not been ruled out (Pi\u00f1eiro, Cordero, & Nogueira, 2000). In support of this, it has been demonstrated that under specific conditions (low pH and high concentration) the polypeptide forms amyloid fibrils (Pavlov, Cherny, Heim, Jovin, & Subramaniam, 2002). Although proT\u03b1 is released by necrotic neurons via a unique nonclassical pathway (Halder et al., 2012, Matsunaga and Ueda, 2010), the peptide lacks a signal peptide sequence required for secretion. Instead, it bears a bipartite nuclear localization signal which consists of two blocks of basic residues (87KR89 and 100TKKQKT105), and is both necessary and sufficient for import of the protein to the nucleus, where it is predominantly located (Manrow et al., 1991, Rubtsov et al., 1997). In contradiction, many studies have also supported proT\u03b1\u2019s cytoplasmic localization (Sburlati et al., 1990, Tsitsiloni et al., 1989). In an effort to address this antiphasis, Enkemann and coworkers demonstrated that proT\u03b1 is in principle detected at active transcription sites in the nucleus, while a smaller fraction remains in the cytoplasm (Enkemann, Wang, Trumbore, & Berger, 2000). It was additionally suggested that, owing to its small size and its negative charge, proT\u03b1 may facilitate the movement of other positively charged molecules (eg, of histones) into and within the nucleus, particularly in highly charged environments where there is a need to overcome electrostatic interactions. In terms of proT\u03b1\u2019s biological role, a vast number of studies have attributed, among others, various and diverse immune-related properties to the polypeptide, the most important of which are analyzed later.",

The significance of this observation was verified in three serial studies in a leukemic in vivo animal model, where mice inoculated with L1210 cells and therapeutically treated with proT\u03b1, survived for over 2 months (Papanastasiou, Baxevanis, & Papamichail, 1992). The immunological modifications caused by proT\u03b1 included the in vivo generation of MHC-restricted tumor-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs; Baxevanis, Gritzapis, Spanakos, Tsitsilonis, & Papamichail, 1995), concomitantly with the enhancement of tumor-reactive NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity (Baxevanis et al., 1994). Both effectors efficiently lysed the syngeneic L1210 tumor cells. The immunoenhancing effect of proT\u03b1 was exerted upstream lymphocyte activation via an interleukin (IL)-2-dependent manner. Most importantly, proT\u03b1 shifted antitumor-reactive immune responses toward the stimulation of the most suitable effectors, CTLs or NK cells, depending on the presence or absence of tumor-specific antigenic peptides, respectively.",

            "text": "Animal studies were followed by in vitro human studies in lymphocytes from cancer patients. Cancer induces severe immune dysfunctions, which are further intensified by anticancer therapies administered to patients. ProT\u03b1 was shown to restore the deficiencies of peripheral blood lymphocytes deriving from patients with advanced solid tumors by enhancing: (1) the allogeneic cell-mediated lympholysis; (2) antigen presentation, as confirmed by the increased values recorded in MLR; and (3) the reduced NK and T-cell cytotoxic activity, by regulating the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and IL-2 (Baxevanis, Reclos, & Papamichail, 1993). Two consecutive studies in melanoma and colon cancer patients showed that proT\u03b1 could act beneficially at early-stage cancers, and when combined with low-dose interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 or IL-2, significantly enhanced monocyte, NK and LAK cell tumoristatic and tumorilytic activities (Eckert et al., 1995, Garbin et al., 1994). ProT\u03b1 in conjunction with either IFN-\u03b3 or IL-2 increased the adhesion of monocytes to tumor targets and the expression of characteristic NK cell markers (eg, CD56, CD16), enhanced the lytic activity of LAK cells, in particular of CD16+CD2\u2013 cells, inhibited the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 and PGE2, and induced the production and secretion of high levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 (Cordero et al., 1995, Eckert, Gr\u00fcnberg, et al., 1997a, Eckert, Gr\u00fcnberg, et al., 1997b, Garbin et al., 1997, L\u00f3pez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 1994). Based on the aforementioned data, the first means of action of proT\u03b1 was shaped, indicating that the polypeptide restores cancer patient lymphocyte deficiencies by selectively controlling the functions of monocytes. Monocytes, in turn, produce cytokines that generate a favorable cytokine milieu, facilitating lymphocyte activation. To optimize this effect, synergy between proT\u03b1 and low concentrations of other BRMs was assessed. For example, proT\u03b1 was combined with a monoclonal antibody to CD3 (anti-CD3), and this synergy further increased tumor cell-lysis by both MHC- and non-MHC-restricted PBMC effectors (Baxevanis et al., 1999).",

Based on proteins up- and downregulated upon PBMC treatment with proT\u03b1, we were the first to analytically describe the scenario underlying its immunoenhancing activity. We suggested that proT\u03b1 ligates innate immunity receptor(s) on APCs, leading to formation of strong APC-T-cell synapses, proinflammatory cytokine secretion and thus, the indirect increase in the cytotoxicity of CTLs, NK cells, and other effectors (Skopeliti et al., 2009). We and others further confirmed the realism of this scenario, showing that proT\u03b1 ligates Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (Mosoian et al., 2010, Omotuyi et al., 2015) and matures monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), which express costimulatory molecules (Skopeliti et al., 2009) and secrete proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, proT\u03b1-matured DCs loaded with tumor antigens induced the polarization of TH1-type tumor-reactive immune responses, resulting in the generation of polyfunctional highly lytic tumor antigen-specific CTLs (Ioannou et al., 2013). Besides DCs, proT\u03b1 could also activate other immune cell types expressing TLR4, eg, neutrophils to secrete \u22c5O2\u2212 and kill tumor cells in vitro (Samara, Ioannou, et al., 2013), and macrophages (Mosoian et al., 2010). Ex vivo experiments showed that proT\u03b1 significantly restored the reduced cytotoxicity of immunosuppressed ascites-derived tumor-associated lymphocytes against ovarian tumor cells and inhibited ovarian tumor growth in SCID mice inoculated with human tumors (Voutsas et al., 2013).",

Interestingly, proT\u03b1 has been shown to be a regulator and enhancer of type I IFN secretion and as such, its antiviral properties were investigated. Qiu and colleagues provided the first evidence of proT\u03b1\u2019s capacity to enhance IFN-\u03b1 secretion by murine macrophages (Qiu et al., 2002). Later, proteomic analysis of human mononuclear cells treated with proT\u03b1 revealed that the polypeptide enhanced the expression of mixovirus-resistance protein 2, an IFN-\u03b1-inducible protein that possesses significant antiviral activity (Skopeliti et al., 2007). Moreover, proT\u03b1 was identified as a potent suppressor of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 replication in primary macrophages, when released by virus-infected CD8+ T cells. It was also shown that this HIV-1 inhibition occurs following viral integration, it is not virus specific (Mosoian et al., 2006), and is rather mediated by the upregulation of type I IFNs, following activation of TLR4 by proT\u03b1 (Mosoian et al., 2010, Teixeira et al., 2015). Similarly, release of proT\u03b1 upon infection of guinea pigs with an attenuated strain of Pichinde virus led to induction of potent antiviral immunity and consequent viral clearance (Bowick et al., 2010). In terms of in vivo applications, proT\u03b1 has been used as a potent adjuvant for hepatitis B virus DNA vaccines, where it successfully enhanced both humoral and cellular immune responses (Jin et al., 2005). Impressively, a most recent report showed that proT\u03b1 displays antiviral activity in other classes than mammals, specifically in fish (tongue sole) infected with megalocytivirus (Zhang & Sun, 2015).",

While apoptosis is a more regulated process that limits the damage in the brain, necrosis tends to expand and is therefore being targeted for stroke treatment (Ueda, 2009). Based on this premise, in an effort to identify soluble molecules that could inhibit necrosis, Ueda and colleagues isolated and identified proT\u03b1 as a unique antineuronal necrosis factor in the conditioned medium of cortical neurons (Ueda, Fujita, Yoshida, Matsunaga, & Ueda, 2007). In more detail, proT\u03b1 could reverse the rapid decrease in survival of cortical neurons, abolish the typical necrosis features in these cells, and switch the cell death mode from necrosis to apoptosis (Ueda et al., 2007). Later on, proT\u03b1\u2019s potent neuroprotective functions were also demonstrated in in vivo experimentally induced cerebral and retinal ischemia (Fujita and Ueda, 2007, Fujita et al., 2009). As for the mechanism underlying proT\u03b1\u2019s neuroprotective role, it has been shown that the polypeptide is released via a nonclassical manner under ischemic stress conditions and its extracellular release is facilitated by its interaction with a cargo molecule, namely S100A13 (Halder et al., 2012, Matsunaga and Ueda, 2010). Upon release, proT\u03b1 activates the TLR4\u2013TRIF-signaling pathway, inducing the expression of neuroprotective factors (Halder, Matsunaga, Ishii, & Ueda, 2015).",

ProT\u03b1(100\u2013109) has been shown to stimulate PBMC proliferation and cytotoxicity and to promote the phenotypic maturation of DCs (Skopeliti et al., 2009), and, consequently, it improved the functionality of immunogenic peptide-pulsed DCs, induced TH1-type immune response polarization (Ioannou et al., 2013), augmented basic properties of human neutrophils (Samara, Ioannou, et al., 2013), enhanced the depressed cytotoxicity of tumor-associated lymphocytes against autologous tumor cells in vitro, and retarded tumor growth in vivo (Voutsas et al., 2013). Using as control a scrambled decapeptide with the same amino acid composition but a different primary structure, the immunoenhancing activity of proT\u03b1(100\u2013109) was shown to be sequence-specific and comparable to that of intact proT\u03b1. Most recently, we reported that proT\u03b1(100\u2013109) radiolabeled with (99m)Tc binds on the surface of human neutrophils via a complex involving TLR4 (Karachaliou et al., 2015) and selectively accumulates in sites of experimentally induced inflammation (C.E. Karachaliou et al., personal communication).",

            "text": "Taking all the above into consideration, we propose a scenario depicting the mode of action of proT\u03b1. In normal healthy cells, proT\u03b1 is localized in the nucleus (Eschenfeldt & Berger, 1986), albeit a fraction of it is assigned to remain in the cytoplasm (Tsitsiloni et al., 1989). In the nucleus, proT\u03b1 regulates gene transcription (Karetsou et al., 2002), shapes DNA remodeling, and promotes cell proliferation (Gomez-Marquez & Rodriguez, 1998). In the cytoplasm, proT\u03b1 protects cells from apoptosis (Jiang et al., 2003) and, due to its negative charge, facilitates the transportation of molecules in the nucleus, protecting the cell from insults, eg, oxidative stress (Niture et al., 2010). In hyperproliferative cells, like cancer cells, proT\u03b1\u2019s gene expression and protein content are increased and this contributes to uncontrolled proliferation and induction of resistance to apoptosis and oxidative stress. Cells receiving death stimuli die violently by necrosis or undergo programmed apoptotic death. During necrosis, cell swelling and membrane disruption lead to abrupt uncontrolled release of internal cell components, including proT\u03b1, which acts as alarmin, alerts cells of the innate arm of immunity expressing TLR4, and initiates immune responses (Ioannou et al., 2012). During apoptosis, the major proportion of proT\u03b1 is transferred to the cytoplasm, where activated caspases cleave the molecule at its C-terminus, generating among other fragments, the decapeptide proT\u03b1(100\u2013109). The negatively charged fragment proT\u03b1(1\u201399) remains in the cytoplasm, where most probably is degraded or, as suggested, is exposed on apoptotic cell surface where it acts as an \u201ceat-me\u201d signal (Evstafieva et al., 2003). The decapeptide proT\u03b1(100\u2013109), or a proportion of it, is protected from degradation as it polymerizes adopting a \u03b2-sheet conformation (Skopeliti et al., 2009) and, consequently, is excreted from dying cells via an unknown mechanism. In both necrosis and apoptosis, exocytosed proT\u03b1 and proT\u03b1(100\u2013109) are sensed as DAMPs by innate immune cells and ligate TLR4 (Ioannou et al., 2013, Mosoian et al., 2010). Stimulated innate immune cells, such as macrophages, neutrophils, monocytes, and DCs, respond by initiating molecular signaling pathways leading to NF-\u03baB activation, chemokine, IFN, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion. Additionally, stimulated macrophages and neutrophils increase their phagocytosis and produce TNF-\u03b1 and \u22c5O2\u2212, respectively (Mosoian et al., 2010, Samara, Ioannou, et al., 2013). Stimulation of APCs (DCs and monocytes) increases antigen (eg, shed from dying cancer cells) uptake and presentation through MHC class I molecules directly to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Upregulation of MHC class II expression by the thymic peptides on monocytes and DCs increases antigen presentation and their synapse with CD4+ helper T cells, which produce TH1-type cytokines (eg, IL-2, IFN-\u03b3), providing a favorable environment for enhancing specific and nonspecific cytotoxicity. CTLs and NK cells produce lytic molecules (perforin), express adhesion molecules (CD2), secrete TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, and kill cell targets (eg, cancer cells) (Fig. 2\n).",

Nevertheless, and despite extensive and intensive research on its mode of action, the efficacy of proT\u03b1 has not yet been tested in humans. In our opinion, the main reason stands in our lack of understanding of its dual role and in elucidating how the same molecule promotes cell proliferation and mediates immunity. This paradox is most surprising and contradictory in the case of cancer. We know that increased proT\u03b1 gene transcription correlates with carcinogenesis, whereas proT\u03b1 ligation to TLR4 promotes anticancer-reactive immune responses. In view of recent progress in elucidating the complex machinery of immune responses and the concept that the immune system responds to both pathogens (PAMPs) and danger signals (DAMPs), the adjuvant mode of action of proT\u03b1 points toward its integration in the family of alarmins. As such, under specific conditions related to danger (resulting from cell damage, destruction, or death), proT\u03b1 and/or smaller fragments of the molecule [eg, proT\u03b1(100\u2013109)] are relocalized extracellularly, ie, at a different site than inside the cell, where they physiologically function. Innate immune cells like DCs that are programmed to sense danger respond to proT\u03b1, and the cascade of an immune response is initiated.",

We believe that proT\u03b1 has adequately proven its potent immunostimulating capacity in vitro and in animals in vivo, by generating the appropriate cytokine milieu promoting the activation of effector cells. Although it should be studied in more detail, it is also known that the polypeptide when administered in animals at relatively high concentrations does not induce toxicity or severe adverse effects. Therefore, the next step should be to test the adjuvant effectiveness of proT\u03b1 or smaller immunoactive fragments thereof in clinical studies, aiming to strengthen deficient immune responses.",

ProT\u03b1 interacts with histone H1, mediates its transfer from and to chromatin, and leads to the formation of CREB\u2013CBP\u2013p300 complex, chromatin remodeling, and gene transcription. (B) Apoptotic stimuli induce the release of cytochrome c, which binds to Apaf-1 and forms the apoptosome. The subsequent activation of caspase 9 results in conversion of procaspase 3 to caspase 3, leading to apoptosis. ProT\u03b1 hinders binding of cytochrome c to Apaf-1, and the apoptotic cascade is inhibited. (C) Normally, the Nrf2\u2013Keap1\u2013Cul3\u2013Rbx1 complex is ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasomes. Under oxidative stress, proT\u03b1 binds to the complex via Keap1, and Nrf2 is released, migrates to the nucleus, and promotes gene transcription and antioxidant enzyme production.",

            "text": "Fig. 2: Proposed scenario on proT\u03b1\u2019s dual role. In normal cells, proT\u03b1 regulates gene expression and cell proliferation in the nucleus. Under abnormal conditions, cells die via necrosis or apoptosis. During necrosis, cell membrane is ruptured and intact proT\u03b1 is released out of the cell. During apoptosis, proT\u03b1 is relocated to the cytoplasm and is cleaved at its C-terminus by activated caspases, and proT\u03b1(100\u2013109) is generated. The decapeptide adopts a \u03b2-sheet conformation and is excreted. Extracellularly, both proT\u03b1 and proT\u03b1(100\u2013109) activate innate immune cells expressing TLR4 (macrophages, neutrophils, DCs, and monocytes) and signal through the MyD88 and TRIF pathways. Cytotoxic responses are enhanced through antigen presentation with MHC class II molecules and synapsis with helper T cells which secrete TH1-type cytokines, and/or with MHC class I molecules, leading to activation of cytotoxic effectors (NK cells and CTLs). In both cases, effector cells upregulate adhesion molecule expression (eg, CD2) and produce lytic molecules (eg, perforin), mediating cell binding and cell destruction, respectively (eg, cancer cell targets, as shown here).",
