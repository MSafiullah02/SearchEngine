Chloroquine, an antimalarial, antiamoebic, immunomodulatory, and a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug, is being reported to be effective in COVID-19. Chloroquine was discovered by Hans Andersag in 1934.[10] Chloroquine phosphate is being recommended in malaria in chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium falciparum malaria and is the first choice of drug in Plasmodium vivax malaria as per a national program in India. The recommended dose for treatment in malaria is 600 mg base (1000 mg salt) orally immediately, followed by 300 mg base (500 mg salt) orally at 6, 24, and 48 h. The total dose is 1500 mg base (2500 mg salt) over 3 days. The loading dose on day 1 is needed due to the large volume of distribution. The prophylactic dose is 500 mg weekly to be started 1 week before entering a malarious area and to continue 4 weeks after returning.[211]",

The main target cells for the SARS-CoV-2 are enterocytes and pneumocytes after it enters the body. After entry, the release of viral genome into the cytoplasm needs fusion of viral and cell membranes, and it attaches to these cells with the help of spike protein\u2013host cell protein interaction. Chloroquine blocks virus infection by elevating endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of the virus. It is reported to act at virus entry and at postentry stages of the infection in vitro cells. Its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory action can add to its efficacy in COVID-19.[5612]",

However, this is based on the treatment of few hundred patients, and large controlled studies are needed to confirm the claims. Hydroxychloroquine, to chloroquine addition of beta-hydroxy chain, has fewer adverse effects, and less efficacy in malaria is being used in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. It is also being explored on a similar basis for COVID-19.[2671314] The Chinese Clinical Trial Registry has 506 studies registered on COVID-19, and out of these, 17 are on chloroquine and 7 are on hydroxychloroquine.[15] Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are 4-aminoquinolines and are in the National List of Essential Medicines of India.[16] Due to its promising results, chloroquine has been included in guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (sixth edition) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.[17] The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization in India has invited applications in the vaccine/drug development, and these will be given high priority.[18]",
