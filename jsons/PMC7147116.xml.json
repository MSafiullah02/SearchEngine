Although the available data are extremely heterogeneous, between 6% and 44% of all male cases with infertility are reported to be of infectious/inflammatory origin (Ahmed, Bello, Mbibu, Maitama, & Kalayi, 2010; Bayasgalan, Naranbat, Radnaabazar, Lhagvasuren, & Rowe, 2004; Comhaire, De Kretser, Farley, & Rowe, 1987).",

This is plausible since bacterial ascension through the seminal tract is common and generally found in patients suffering from acute symptomatic epididymitis (Pilatz et al., 2015). In these patients, post\u2010infectious azoospermia is evident in up to 10% of cases (Rusz et al., 2012) and suspected to be related to epididymal obstruction (Gao & Wang, 2016).",

In this connection, impaired spermatogenesis and infertility after acute epididymo\u2010orchitis or mumps orchitis have been reported and histologically confirmed (Osegbe, 1991; Zhang et al., 2015). However, the majority of men seeking consultation for couple infertility and suffering from azoospermia are asymptomatic and never report an episode of acute genital tract infection/inflammation (Jungwirth et al., 2012; Schuppe et al., 2017). Consequently, it is more common to describe infectious and/or inflammatory conditions of the male genital tract as \u201cmale accessory gland infection\u201d (MAGI) (Comhaire, Verschraegen, & Vermeulen, 1980; Rowe, Comhaire, Hargreave, & Mahmoud, 2000). As the diagnosis is primarily based on abnormalities in the ejaculate, organ\u2010specific attribution of infectious/inflammatory signs remains difficult (Schuppe et al., 2008). Thus, patient categorisation using MAGI criteria does not necessarily reflect testicular or epididymal inflammation and its sequelae (Fijak et al., 2018).",

However, only a few studies investigated pathogens in testicular tissues and provided suggestive evidence that the testis is not sterile (Alfano et al., 2018; Erles et al., 2001; Martorell et al., 2005; Sripada et al., 2010). In addition, it should be considered that various bacterial and viral species with undefined pathogenicity are detected in the semen of healthy males and patients presenting with sub/infertility (Mandar, Turk, Korrovits, Ausmees, & Punab, 2018; Neofytou, Sourvinos, Asmarianaki, Spandidos, & Makrigiannakis, 2009).",

However, the aetiologic category of \u201cinfection\u201d in various reports is mainly related to medical history and not based on clinical variables (Chan et al., 2005; Han et al., 2016). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective study which set out to comprehensively evaluate infection and inflammation in patients presenting with azoospermia using a 2\u2010glass test and analysis of semen, testicular fluid and testicular tissue by measuring inflammatory parameters and performing systematic microbiological investigations.

Comparable observations have been made in a limited number of males (ethical limitations) suffering from acute epididymitis. In the acute phase, a reduction in spermatogenesis and an intratesticular invasion by polymorphonuclear cells were evident in such patients (Osegbe, 1991; Wolin, 1971), while in the follow\u2010up about 1 year later, disruption of testicular architecture associated with fibrosis, hyalinisation, hypospermatogenesis, maturation arrest or Sertoli cell\u2010only syndrome was reported (Dietz, 1960; Osegbe, 1991). This shows that genital tract infection is clearly related to impaired testicular architecture and also a possible disruption of the blood\u2013testis barrier (Fijak et al., 2018; Lotti et al., 2018). In addition to testicular damage, epididymal obstruction is frequently a consequence of induced seminal tract infection in animal models (Michel et al., 2016). In humans, there is evidence that azoospermia following acute epididymitis might also be of obstructive origin, since no decrease in testicular volume was detected (Pilatz et al., 2013). Thus, seminal tract obstruction might be a reason for azoospermia. In several case series involving patients with obstructive azoospermia, this is underlined by an infectious aetiology as high as 22%\u201347% of cases (Chan et al., 2005; Han et al., 2016).",

Although the MAGI system is commonly used to characterise these patients by clinical and laboratory findings (Comhaire et al., 1980; Rowe et al., 2000; Schuppe et al., 2017), the diagnostics do not consider STI\u2010PCR testing (Eley & Pacey, 2011), lack soluble inflammatory parameters (e.g. cytokines; Pilatz et al., 2017) and sperm DNA fragmentation (Lotti et al., 2017), and assume a sterile urogenital tract under normal conditions. Recent advances in microbiological techniques, however, have broken with the latter dogma (Hou et al., 2013; Imirzalioglu et al., 2008; Weng et al., 2014). When investigating the seminal plasma microbiome with next\u2010generation sequencing (NGS), an average number of 135 genera and 569 species were detected in each sample, with Lactobacillus (19.9%), Pseudomonas (9.85%), Prevotella (8.51%) and Gardnerella (4.21%) being the most dominant genera (Weng et al., 2014). Interestingly, semen samples with normal parameters were mainly found to be clustered in the Lactobacillus\u2010predominant group (Weng et al., 2014), while another research team failed to demonstrate significant differences between the seminal microbiome of sperm donors and infertile patients (Hou et al., 2013).",

As an immune\u2010privileged organ due to the blood\u2013testis barrier, testicular tissue is generally believed to be sterile. However, just recently, a microbiome study evaluating testicular tissue from azoospermic and testicular cancer patients revealed that many different bacterial classes can be detected by NGS (Alfano et al., 2018). Of further interest was the fact that the amount of bacterial DNA was increased in patients with NOA compared to those with normal spermatogenesis (Alfano et al., 2018). Finally, no significant differences were identified in NOA patients with positive sperm retrieval (n = 5) and those without (n = 5; Alfano et al., 2018). Although we did not apply NGS, we were never able to identify any pathogens in testicular swabs and testicular tissue by sensitive 16S rDNA analysis, except for one swab sample which was positive for Enterobacter cloacae and Leclercia adecarboxylata although the corresponding testicular tissue was negative.",

However, in testicular tissue samples of azoospermic patients undergoing sperm retrieval, adeno\u2010associated viruses were evident in 10 of 38 biopsies without any statistical differences between viral DNA status and histological diagnosis (Erles et al., 2001). In another TESE series, human papillomaviruses (HPVs) were reported in 12 of 185 (6%) patients with comparable testicular histology undergoing sperm retrieval whereby HPV 16 was the most common genotype (Martorell et al., 2005). One study group working with azoospermic patients (n = 52) who had a history of mumps orchitis showed a testicular sperm retrieval rate of 73% (Zhang et al., 2015).
