            "text": "There is much interest currently in the occurrence and control of pharmaceutical contaminants in the aqueous environment. One specific group of compounds, iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM), has become the focus of environmental concern due to the presence of these compounds in wastewaters and potential contamination of, and harm to, the aquatic environment. As halogenated compounds, they are the main contributors to the burden of total adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) in clinical wastewater [1] and several ICM compounds have been measured at relatively high concentrations (>1 \u03bcg L\u22121) in many aqueous environments, including water treatment plant effluents, groundwaters, creeks, rivers, and drinking water [2]. At present, it is unclear whether ICM compounds themselves at the concentrations likely to be present pose a significant risk to human health, but iopromide has been shown recently to have estrogen activity [3]. There is also concern about the ecotoxicity of metabolite/transformation products of ICM, whose presence in environmental waters is suspected [4]. The ICM compounds are derivatives of 2,4,6-tri-iodobenzoic acid possessing polar carboxylic and hydroxyl moieties in their branch chains. Most ICM compounds are non-ionic, such as iopromide, while others are ionic ICM compounds, such as diatrizoate. As a consequence of their physico-chemical nature, they are recalcitrant, and conventional municipal treatment plants are not able to remove them effectively from influent wastewaters [2], [4]. In view of this it may be necessary for water utilities to employ an advanced oxidation process (AOP) to control these contaminants.",

            "text": "While some recent studies have reported on the degradation of iopromide by UV photolysis [5], ozone [6] and ozone-sonolysis AOP [7], previous research by the authors [16] has identified the combination of UV irradiation and peroxydisulphate as another potential AOP for the effective treatment of ICM compounds. Peroxydisulphate (S2O8\n2\u2212 ion) is a strong oxidant (E\u00b0 = 2.05 V) which has been used widely in the petroleum industry for the treatment of hydraulic fluids or as a reaction initiator [8]. The peroxydisulfate is normally available as a salt associated with ammonium, sodium or potassium. Potassium peroxydisulfate (KPS) recently was shown to be an effective disinfectant and/or oxidant for the Norwalk virus, foot-and-mouth disease and Coronaviridae (causing severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2014SARS) [9]. It has also been reported to be effective for degrading organics in hazardous wastewaters in acidic or basic media through direct chemical oxidation [8], where peroxydisulfate is used as a sacrificial reagent [10]. However, since the reactions of peroxydisulfate are generally slow at normal temperatures, the thermal or photochemical activated decomposition of S2O8\n2\u2212 ion to SO4\n\u2212\n\u2022 radical has been proposed as a method of accelerating the process [11], as summarised in the following reactions (Eqs. (1), (2), (3), (4), (5)):(1)S2O82\u2212 + photons \u2192 2SO4\u2022\u2212\n(2)SO4\u2022\u2212 + RH2 \u2192 SO42\u2212 + H+ + RH\u2022\n(3)RH\u2022 + S2O82\u2212 \u2192 R + SO42\u2212 + H+ + SO4\u2022\u2212\n(4)SO4\u2022\u2212 + R \u2192 R\u2022\n(5)2R\u2022 \u2192 RR (dimer)\n",

The SO4\n2\u2212 is practically inert and is not considered to be a pollutant; the USEPA has listed it under the secondary drinking water standards with a maximum concentration of 250 mg/L (1.43 mM), based on aesthetic reasons [13]. Theoretically, sulfate ion can be regenerated electrolytically to peroxydisulfate for reuse in water as shown by Balazs et al. [14]. Since peroxydisulfate will start reacting exothermally only at 100 \u00b0C [15], it is not recommended for use in conventional water purification processes. The potential use of photo-activated peroxydisulfate at ambient temperature is of interest and has been investigated as a treatment method for the endocrine disruptor chemical, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) [16]. At neutral pH, photo-activated (UV254) peroxydisulfate achieved a complete degradation of 2 mM BHA within 5 min, and a complete mineralisation within 45 min.",

As expected, the rate of compound degradation increased systematically with light intensity, and an overall degradation of 90% was achieved in 30 min for both isomers under a light intensity of 6 lamps (\u22489 \u00d7 10\u22126\n Einstein L\u22121\n s\u22121). The degradation kinetics were found to be approximately first-order (viz. ln \nC\n \u2212 ln \nC\n0\n = \u2212kt), and the first-order rate constant was linearly related to the light intensity (number of lamps), as shown in Fig. 3\n. It can be seen that there was a noticeable difference in reactivity between the two isomers, with the reaction rate of isomer 2 significantly greater than isomer 1. The linear relationship between the rate constant and the light intensity can be explained by the effects of both direct photolysis and SO4\n\u2212\n\u2022 radical reactions. For direct photolysis, the compound degradation rate, k\nP (s\u22121), can be shown to be directly proportional to the light intensity as follows [19]:(6)kP=2.303\u03a6I\u03bb\u03b5\u03bblwhere \u03a6 is the quantum yield (mol Einstein\u22121), I\n\u03bb is the intensity of the incident light at 253.7 nm (Einstein L\u22121\n s\u22121), \u025b\n\u03bb is the compound molar absorptivity at 253.7 nm (L mol\u22121\n cm\u22121), and l is the light path (cm). Based on this formula and using values of \u03a6\nIop and \u025b\n\u03bb-Iop recently reported for iopromide (viz. \u03a6\n = 0.039 mol Einstein\u22121, \u025b\n\u03bb\n = 210.4 L mol\u22121 cm\u22121; Canonica et al. [5]), the corresponding values for k\nP are 0.019 min\u22121 (2 lamps), 0.038 min\u22121 (4 lamps) and 0.057 min\u22121 (6 lamps). By comparing these calculated values with those in Fig. 3 it can be seen that the measured values from UV/KPS are greater, particularly for isomer 2, and this increase may be attributed to simultaneous reactions with SO4\n\u2212\n\u2022 radicals, and KPS. The relationship between the rate constant and SO4\n\u2212\n\u2022 radical reactions is discussed in the next section.",

The overall reaction rate may be expressed as follows:(7)\u2212d[CIop]dt=kP[CIop]q+kSO4[SO4\u2212]r[CIop]q+kKPS[KPS]p[CIop]qwhere [C\nIop], [SO4\n\u2212\n\u2022] and [KPS] are the iopromide, radical and KPS concentrations, respectively, and k\nP, kSO4 and k\nKPS are the corresponding reaction rate constants. The exponent for iopromide concentration, \u2018q\u2019, was assumed for simplicity to be the same for all the [C\nIop] terms and this was justified subsequently. To evaluate the reaction exponents, \u2018p\u2019, \u2018q\u2019 and \u2018r\u2019, iopromide degradation experiments were carried out with varying concentrations of iopromide and KPS; varying the KPS concentration also varied the SO4\n\u2212\n\u2022 concentration. In the first set of experiments the reaction conditions were kept constant (i.e. KPS concentration, UV intensity, pH), except for the initial iopromide concentration (C\nIop) which was varied in the range, 0.0758\u20130.506 mM. From Eq. (7) it can be seen that if the value of the exponent \u2018q\u2019 can be assumed to be unity, then the equation describes a first-order reaction for the temporal change of C\nIop (assuming all other reaction conditions are constant); whereupon after integration, the variation of C\nIop is given by the linear relationship: ln(C\n0/C) = \nkt. The results of the tests for isomer 1 for each initial iopromide concentration (C\n0) can be seen in Fig. 4\n, where the value of ln(C\n0/C) is plotted versus time. It can be seen that in each case the first-order model fitted the results closely, within experimental error, and thus the value of the exponent \u2018q\u2019 can be assumed to be one. Therefore, Eq. (7) can be simplified as:(8)\u2212d[CIop]dt=kP+kSO4[SO4\u2212]r+kKPS[KPS]p[CIop]\n",

The results of the tests indicated that the iopromide degradation rate increased with KPS concentration. The form of the relationship was found to be semi-logarithmic, as shown in Fig. 5\n, with the following general form: ln (k\n1) = \nh[KPS] + \nf, where h and f are constants. Thus, it can be shown that k\n1\n = (g) exp(h[KPS]), where g is a new constant (f\n = ln(g)).

(9), thereby leading to increasing H+ ions being generated as a consequence of aqueous SO4\n\u2212\n\u2022 scavenging (Eq. (10)). After the initial period, the further decrease in pH with time was relatively gradual and similar for all the KPS concentrations. It seems reasonable to speculate that in the initial reaction period (0\u20135 min), substantial degradation of iopromide occurs leading to intermediate products, some of which may behave as weak organic acids leading to the buffering of solution pH, both during the initial period and subsequently. Similarly, the results shown in Fig. 7b, for the same specific oxidation conditions (4 lamps, 0.126 mM iopromide, 2 mM KPS) but different initial pH values, show a reduction in solution pH with time corresponding to approximately equivalent H+ production as a result of the scavenging of sulfate radicals.",

            "text": "Although no investigation of reaction products was carried out in this study, there were clear indications that substantial quantities of reaction intermediates were formed. Changes in iopromide concentration and solution TOC (total organic carbon) can be seen in Fig. 8\n, which demonstrated that there was very little loss of TOC (conversion to CO2-\u2018mineralisation\u2019) in the early stages of the reactions (<10 min) where the corresponding degradation of iopromide was substantial. Continuation of the oxidation conditions beyond the point of full iopromide degradation leads to near-complete mineralisation of the reaction products (i.e. loss of solution TOC) after approximately 70\u201380 min. In general, little work has been reported on the degradation mechanisms of ICM compounds, but one recent study has indicated that oxidation by OH\u2022 radicals of iomeprol lead to the conversion of hydroxyl moieties on the compound side chains by hydrogen abstraction to aldehyde or ketone groups [22]; similar products have been reported for iopromide undergoing biodegradation [23]. In contrast, Ning and Graham [6] observed in ozone reactions with ICM compounds the release of iodine during the period of compound degradation, suggesting cleavage of the iodine\u2013carbon bond on the aromatic ring. Further work is required to investigate the degradation mechanisms for iopromide in the UV/KPS system, and the pathways arising from direct photolysis and sulphate radical reaction.",

            "text": "The aqueous degradation behaviour of iopromide, as a representative non-ionic ICM compound, in the presence of photo-activated potassium peroxydisulfate (KPS) has been studied under various conditions of UV254 light intensity, reactant concentrations, and solution pH. As iopromide has been found to be a recalcitrant environmental contaminant, the application of advanced oxidation processes to wastewaters containing ICM compounds represents the most viable method of treatment. The results of laboratory experiments with photo-activated KPS have shown that under specific conditions complete removal of iopromide was achieved within 30 min, and near-complete mineralisation within 80 min. The mechanisms of degradation are believed to involve a combination of direct photolysis, sulphate radical attack, and, to a minor degree, direct oxidation by peroxydisulfate. Approximate values for the reaction rate constants have been determined and found to be equal to 1\u20132 \u00d7 104\n M\u22121\n s\u22121 for sulfate radicals, and 1\u20132 M\u22122\n s\u22121 for direct reactions with KPS (S2O8\n2\u2212). The rate constants appear to be relatively low compared to published values for sulphate radical reactions with other organic substrates, but this is believed to be due to the discriminating nature of SO4\n\u2212\n\u2022 radical reactions, involving electron transfer, addition or hydrogen abstraction, and the recalcitrant nature of the iopromide molecule. Overall compound degradation was observed to follow first-order kinetics where the rate constant decreased with initial solution pH. During the reaction the pH of the solution was observed to decrease with time, which was believed to be the consequence of sulfate radical scavenging.",
