            "text": "Cytokines, currently known to be more than 130 in number, are relatively small signaling proteins of MW < 30 kDa, usually glycosylated, and produced by a variety of different cells including those of the immune system, epithelia, endothelia, and stroma. Cytokines are key modulators of the immune and inflammatory responses functioning in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner stimulating or suppressing cellular activities in infection, innate and adaptive immunity, autoimmunity, inflammation, and malignancy. Key to an understanding of these regulatory proteins is the recognition of their pleiotropism and sometimes overlapping activities, functional redundancies, and side effects. Their secretion may be induced by an array of different stimuli associated with infection, inflammation, or tumorigenesis, first releasing waves of (for example) proinflammatory molecules followed by anti-inflammatory cytokines to restore homeostasis. Cytokines therefore induce a diverse range of biological responses including proliferation, differentiation, activation, inflammation, chemotaxis, and cell death and the nature of an immune or inflammatory stimulus determines whether an immune response is humoral- or cell-mediated, cytotoxic, immunosuppressive or allergic.",

            "text": "The many attempts to classify cytokines over the last three decades and the complexities in devising classifications based on structural and/or functional parameters are not hard to understand given the sheer number of imprecisely defined \u201cfactors\u201d identified in the early years and the difficulties and work involved in trying to accumulate details on functions and diseases. In their discussion of the evolution of cytokine biology and nomenclature, Steinke and Borish draw attention to three phases of development in the identification and classification of cytokines. The identification of cytokines by their biologic activities (e.g., T-cell growth) occurred in the first, or factor, stage. The production of recombinant cytokines and demonstration of their pleiotropism and redundancy led to much of our current understanding and this can be called the recombinant-cloning or second phase. Currently, we are experiencing the third, or genomic phase, where cytokines are being identified on the basis of homology with known, characterized cytokines. In the more recent progressive assemblages published by Tato and Cua detailing each cytokine\u2019s receptor(s), source, targets, major function, and disease association, the first 16 interleukins were grouped in order of their discovery. Many of these interleukins form homodimeric structures and have the \u03b3c and/or \u03b2c chains in their receptors. More recently discovered interleukins have proven more difficult to classify in relation to their function in health and disease due to the complexity of their heterodimeric ligands and receptors. For example, a homotrimeric motif for ligands and receptors and bidirectional signaling were found to be important features of the TNF family. Many original names are still in use and many of the originally described \u201cfactors\u201d share receptors with other interleukins.",

The cytokine classification presented is based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes with input from Vacchelli et al. (http://dx.doi.org/10.4161/onci.20459). Nine main families are recognized (Table 5.1) with most of the cytokines of interest classified in the hematopoietic growth factor, interferon (IFN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) families. In the hematopoietin family, approved cytokines manufactured by recombinant DNA technology are aldesleukin (rh-interleukin-2 [IL-2]), oprelvekin (rhIL-11), filgrastim and tbo-filgrastim (rh-granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]), sargramostim (rh-granulocyte macrophage [GM]-CSF), metreleptin (rh-leptin) and rh-erythropoietins, epoetin, and darbepoetin alfa. Anakinra, a recombinant receptor antagonist for IL-1, is a representative of the IL-1 cytokine family; recombinant interferons alfa-1, alfa-2, beta-1, and gamma-1 make up the interferon family; palifermin (rh-keratinocyte growth factor [KGF]) and becaplermin (rhPDGF-BB) are in the PDGF family; and rh-bone morphogenetic protein [BMP]-2 and rhBMP-7 represent the TGF\u03b2 family. Chemokines, placed here in group 9 (Table 5.1), behave as regulatory molecules for leukocytes and lymphoid tissue and have an important role in infectious, inflammatory, allergic and autoimmune responses as well as angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, and tumor growth. No members of the chemokine family are yet approved for therapy.\n",

Overall, and as one might expect with biological systems involving genetically diverse patients; the diverse range of biological activities of cytokines; their action in causing the release of additional cytokines; the knock-on pharmacological effects of these secondarily released agents; and different disease statuses of patients, side effects of cytokines are not unusual, are to be expected, and patient-to-patient spectra of these effects will be variable.",

            "text": "It is said that virtually all patients treated with interferon alfa experience some adverse effect(s) at some time during therapy. In fact, the literature on side effects to interferons is voluminous and probably greater than all the other approved, non-mAb biologics literatures put together. Three interferon alfa preparations are in the CDER Biologic Products List. Peginterferon alfa-2a together with the guanosine analog and nucleoside inhibitor, ribavirin (1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranosyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxyamide Copegus\u00ae; Fig. 5.1) are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adults who have compensated liver disease and were not previously treated with interferon alfa. This drug combination is also the approved treatment of patients infected with hepatitis C and HIV and peginterferon alfa-2a alone is approved for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B who have compensated liver disease, viral replication, and liver inflammation. Interferon alfa-2b is administered extensively for hepatitis B and C as well as several malignancies (Table 5.2). It upregulates the expression of MHC I proteins enhancing activation of CD8+ T cells and cytotoxic lymphocyte-mediated killing as well as inducing synthesis of several other antiviral agents including protein kinase R. Peginterferon alfa-2a and peginterferon alfa-2b are covalent conjugates of the recombinant interferon with a single branched bis-monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain, MW 40 kDa. Pegylation, which is FDA approved, nontoxic and contributes to water solubility, helps to protect the protein from immune recognition, that is, it reduces the immunogenicity and antigenicity and increases the molecule\u2019s size thus extending protein half-life and circulatory time and reducing renal clearance. For interferon alfa-2a, adverse events in patients treated with the pegylated form and ribavirin occur with a similar, or significantly less, frequency than those treated with standard interferon/ribavirin. For interferon alfa-2b, a number of adverse events occur more frequently with pegylated interferon/ribavirin. Premedication with acetaminophen is often recommended prior to the first dose of peginterferon alfa-2b; thereafter, premedication is undertaken as needed. In some reports on side effects, especially in the earlier literature, interferon alfa is often not distinguished as alfa-2a or alfa-2b although this can be important as demonstrated by some of the different effects induced by alfa-2a and alfa-2b interferons mentioned below.\n",

Of the patients who develop severe depressive symptoms, most occur within the first 3 months of treatment and the incidence of depressive disorders has been estimated to be 23\u201341 %. Symptoms may be prolonged for 6 months or more after the cessation of therapy. There is some evidence that the serotonergic system is involved in the pathophysiologic mechanism although the central opioid, dopamine, and glutamate neurotransmitter systems may also be involved. A positive correlation between depression scores and serum concentrations of soluble ICAM (intracellular adhesion molecule)-1 in patients who received interferon alfa led to the suggestion that the cytokine may induce the adhesion molecule which then increases the permeability of the blood\u2013brain-barrier, allowing the interferon to more easily enter the brain. A number of susceptibility factors have been suggested including a history of depression; high dose of interferon; long treatment duration; female sex; and possession of the apolipoprotein E\u03b54 allele, said to be associated with some neuropsychiatric disorders.",

A comparison of interferon beta-1a, 30 \u03bcg, given intramuscularly (im) once per week with interferon beta-1b, 44 \u03bcg, subcutaneously (sc) every other day, showed that injection site reactions and antibodies were significantly more frequent in patients given the beta-1b preparation but after 2 years, clinical outcomes to this agent were superior. The questions of the production of neutralizing antibodies to interferon beta and whether they reduce the therapeutic effectiveness in treated patients, especially in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, are important ones. Such antibodies are found in about a quarter of patients treated with sc administered interferon beta-1b and the consensus is that they neutralize or reduce the cytokine\u2019s activity. Some believe that this has the potential to significantly reduce the effectiveness of the therapy and it has been suggested that the immunogenic potential of interferon beta should therefore be considered as well as its safety.

The occurrence of fatal acute respiratory failure in four patients treated with interferon gamma-1b for advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis prompted further investigation in the form of a double blind study of the effect of the cytokine in 330 patients with that condition. No significant differences were found in lung function, gas exchange, or quality of life, but the patients experienced more frequent upper respiratory infections and pneumonia. However, acute respiratory insufficiency has been reported in a single patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 4 months after receiving interferon gamma. Cardiovascular toxicity to interferon gamma, particularly at higher doses, and including hypotension, arrhythmias, coronary vasospasm, and ventricular tachycardia and renal toxicity, namely acute renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, and tubular necrosis, have been recorded.",

Described by Metcalf as \u201cthe master regulators of granulocyte and macrophage populations,\u201d the CSFs are used to treat chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, mobilize stem cells for transplantation, and enhance the immune response to cancer. Despite dissimilarities in amino acid sequences, human granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) show three-dimensional structural similarities (Figs. 5.4 and 5.5) to each other and a number of other signaling proteins, for example, human growth hormone (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-30472-4_7, section \u201cHuman Growth Hormone\u201d), interferon beta (section \u201cInterferon Beta\u201d), IL-2 (section \u201cAldesleukin\u201d), and IL-4. This conservation of tertiary structure suggests similar binding of the different ligands to their respective receptors. Currently, approved members of the CSF family are filgrastim and pegfilgrastim, both G-CSFs, sargramostim, a GM-CSF, and tbo-filgrastim, a short acting biosimilar (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-30472-4_13) G-CSF (Table 5.2). The latter is used for severe neutropenia in patients with lung cancer receiving platinum drug chemotherapy. GM-CSF, used as an immunostimulant following bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy, is also viewed as a potential immunoadjuvant for anticancer vaccines. The E. coli-derived GM-CSF molgramostim, seen as a potential immunostimulant, showed a higher incidence of adverse effects than sargramostim and was not granted FDA approval.\n\n",

Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) following G-CSF is more likely when a rapid rise in the white cells occurs in patients taking pulmonary toxic drugs, when there is concomitant infection, and in patients with HLA-B51 or HLA-B52 antigens. Other occasional respiratory side effects are pulmonary toxicities, particularly pulmonary edema which has proved fatal, and interstitial pneumonitis. There has been speculation that GM-CSF might contribute to the development of acute coronary syndrome. In fact, cardiovascular complications have been observed. These include fluid retention, pulmonary edema and weight gain, aortitis to molgramostim, and capillary leak syndrome (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-30472-4_1, section \u201cCapillary Leak Syndrome\u201d) following G-CSF which can be severe and even fatal. Recorded hematologic side effects to CSFs consist mainly of a number of cases of thrombocytopenia, some with an immune mechanism, splenomegaly, and splenic rupture (note FDA issued warning, Table 5.2). There is a belief that G-CSF may be a risk for the progression of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but this has not been unequivocally established. MDS has been reported after G-CSF treatment and the incidence of MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was found to be 11 % in patients treated with G-CSF, but only 5.8 % in patients receiving immunosuppression alone. In another more recent study, patients who received G-CSF showed a 2.5-fold increased risk. Interpretation of results relevant to the alleged risk of G-CSF is not straight forward however. Findings that there is no significant relationship between G-CSF therapy and MDS/AML onset are at odds with the belief that the risk of leukemia in severe congenital neutropenia patients increases with the G-CSF therapy. Two other potentially life-threatening responses to CSFs, both the subject of warnings, are anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions and severe adverse events such as acute chest syndrome, vaso-occlusive episodes, multiorgan failure, and death seen in patients with sickle cell disease.",

Intended for the treatment of foot and ankle fusions, a major claimed advantage of the product is the elimination both of the need to harvest autologous bone and the associated risks of ongoing pain and infection. Augment\u00ae Bone Graft is indicated for use as an alternative to autograft in hindfoot and ankle fusion procedures that require supplemental graft material, for example, in tibiocalcaneal, talonavicular, and calcaneocuboid fusions. In October 2014, the FDA approved the Premarket Approval Application for Augment\u00ae Bone Graft subject to a preapproval facilities inspection. Already approved in Canada, the rationale for the product\u2019s action is the inclusion of rhPDGF-BB for the promotion of growth and proliferation of osteoblasts and beta-tricalcium phosphate, a resorbable synthetic bone matrix, as the framework for new bone growth. Each component is packaged separately and mixed immediately before use. Already issued warnings and precautions for the product include its as yet unknown effect on fetal development; whether or not it is excreted in milk; its safety at sites other than the ankle and foot; the need for its use on well-vascularized bone; unknown safety of repeat applications; and the product\u2019s safety in patients less than 18 years old. In the primary clinical study, Augment\u00ae Bone Graft was compared to autologous bone graft as the \u201cgold standard\u201d in a representative foot and ankle fusions clinical model. Safety studies revealed 973 treatment-emergent adverse events with no significant differences between the two treatment groups. Overall, the Augment group showed fewer serious adverse events and fewer complications associated with surgery and infections. In a prospective, open-label, multicenter trial undertaken in Canada and designed to evaluate Augment\u00ae Bone Graft, 60 patients requiring hindfoot, midfoot, or ankle fusions, were followed for 36 weeks. A total of 22 adverse events, none serious, was recorded, most arising from the surgery; 15 were general and administration site disorders (swelling, feeling hot, tenderness, and impaired healing), 5 were due to injury and procedural complications, and 2 were musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (muscle spasms, and pain).",

An important occasional and serious adverse event of IL-2 therapy is capillary (sometimes called vascular) leak syndrome (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-30472-4_1, section \u201cCapillary Leak Syndrome\u201d) which causes hypovolemia and fluid accumulation in the extravascular spaces and may lead to oliguria, ischemia, and confusion. Aldesleukin therapy can induce increased vascular permeability, interstitial edema, and ultimately organ failure seen as an increase in body weight, fluid retention, peripheral edema, ascites, pleural and pericardial effusions, and ultimately pulmonary and cardiovascular failure. Pulmonary side effects to aldesleukin are usually related to capillary leak syndrome and are more likely, and more severe (e.g., as pulmonary edema and respiratory distress), in patients with existing cardiac problems. Hematologic adverse effects, particularly anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia occur but are rarely severe or dose limiting. Thrombocytopenia is a common toxicity of high dose IL-2 therapy but rapidly reverses upon cessation of treatment. Eosinophilia may occur in the later stages of therapy accompanied by rash and pruritus. Figure 5.9 shows the hematologic changes, often rapid and dramatic, occurring in response to aldesleukin challenges over a 6 day period. Within hours of the first dose, platelets and lymphocytes fall rapidly to low levels and eosinophil numbers rise slowly, whereas neutrophils and hemoglobin are maintained at stable levels. At the cessation of treatment, lymphocytes and platelets quickly return to normal and, in fact, may exceed their baseline levels by 2- to 5-fold. Eosinophils persist and may do so for many weeks. Endocrine effects usually manifest as hypothyroidism which may affect up to one-third of patients, or as the far less common hyperthyroidism. Renal toxicity, especially oliguria, and gastrointestinal toxicities are also seen, the latter being particularly common in the form of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, gastritis, and mucositis. Gastrointestinal perforation has also been reported. IL-2-induced infectious toxicities may occur at venous catheter sites and in the urinary tract. Such infections, usually due to Staphylococcus species, are thought to arise from the known affect of IL-2 on neutrophil chemotaxis. Neurological effects, especially to high doses during IL-2 therapy, include anxiety, depression, altered sleep patterns, somnolence, emotional fragility, vivid dreams, and confusion. The list of aldesleukin-induced cutaneous reactions is extensive, ranging from mild erythema, pruritus, injection site reactions, and vitiligo, to urticaria, angioedema, reactivation of eczema, exacerbation of psoriasis, generalized erythema followed by desquamation, vasculitis, and severe manifestations like pemphigus, IgA bullous dermatosis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. An acute blistered scalded skin-like reaction after IL-2 therapy in an immunocompromised patient (Fig. 5.10) suggests that the cytokine should be given with great caution, and on an individualized basis, to immunocompromised patients. A curious case involved the implication of high-dose IL-2 therapy in the occurrence of multifocal fixed drug eruptions after the administration of other drugs, namely, ondansetron, granisetron, acetaminophen (paracetamol), and indomethacin.\n\n",

The receptor for IL-1 (IL-1R), in membrane or soluble form, is widely expressed on tissues and organs and exists as two types, type I which is responsible for the expression of the inflammatory effects of IL-1 and type II which may compete for IL-1 and act as a suppressor of the cytokine. Anakinra is a recombinant-specific receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) for IL-1 differing from the natural receptor by the addition of a single methionine at the amino terminal end (Table 5.2). Anakinra therefore acts as a biological response modifier in the treatment of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and the spectrum of autoinflammatory syndromes collectively known as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) (Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-30472-4_4, sections \u201cCAPS Diseases and Approved Indications for Canakinumab\u201d and \u201cCanakinumab: Warnings, Precautions, and Adverse Events\u201d).

All symptoms of Schnitzler syndrome, a rare, underdiagnosed systemic disease with many features in common with the above autoinflammatory syndromes including nonitching urticarial-like lesions, fever, and bone/joint pain, can be relieved within hours of the first injection of anakinra.

A case of apparent immediate hypersensitivity was reported in a 25-year-old woman with familial Mediterranean fever who developed urticaria and angioedema on the face and diffuse erythema over the entire body after the 12th subcutaneous daily dose of anakinra (100 mg/day). The reactions responded well to antihistamines and intradermal tests with the drug proved positive, suggesting a type I hypersensitivity response. A desensitization protocol was employed after a premedication dose of 10 mg of cetirizine given 1 h before the first sc injection of anakinra. Six doses, starting at 1.5 mg, were administered at 1 h intervals. Subsequent doses were 3, 5.5, 12.5, 25, and 52.5 mg, totaling a cumulative dose of 100 mg of anakinra. After desensitization, the intradermal test was negative and the patient continued on daily anakinra without problems. A similar cutaneous reaction involving itching, erythema on the face and abdomen, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain was seen 3 h after administration of anakinra. The patient proved skin prick test-positive to the recombinant cytokine, again indicating a type I allergic reaction.

Precautions included the risk of serious allergic reactions and the need for careful use of the drug in patients with existing cardiovascular disease and stroke. Uncontrolled hypertension was listed as a contraindication. Adverse reactions to peginesatide observed in controlled studies of dialysis patients were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, cough, arteriovenous fistula, headache, muscle pains and spasms, arthralgia, pyrexia, hypotension, hypertension, hyperkalemia, and URTI. Seizures were seen in some patients. Antibodies to peginesatide were detected in 1.2 % of patients (29 of 2357); 0.9 % (21) were neutralizing antibodies and in approximately half of these patients hemoglobin levels declined. As a result of postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions including potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis, the FDA announced a voluntary recall of Ormontys\u00ae Injection.

This is in contrast to the large and rapidly growing literature on rhBMP-2 induced adverse events. In an early clinical trial designed to evaluate rhBMP-7 in the treatment of tibial reunions, adverse events were reported to be mild or moderate and nonserious, for example, fever, nausea and vomiting, leg edema and discomfort, and hematoma at the operative site. Low levels of anti-BMP-7 antibodies were detected in 10 % of the treated patients but all titers were low with no related adverse events. With the possibility in mind that risks following the use of rhBMP-7 in anterior cervical fusion procedures might not be as high as seen with BMP-2, the safety of rhBMP-7 was examined in 123 patients undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion using interbody cages. Assessed over the first 30 days, there were no deaths or reoperations but 2.4 % of patients experienced brachialgia and dysphagia.

Sometimes referred to as a pluripotent growth factor, the cytokine is important for hematopoiesis, spermatogenesis, and melanogenesis; nonlethal point mutations in its receptor can cause anemia, impaired fertility, and pigmentation. The c-Kit receptor, also referred to as the stem (or mast) cell growth factor receptor, proto-oncogene c-Kit, tyrosine-protein kinase kit, and CD117, is a receptor tyrosine kinase type III expressed on a number of different cells including mast cells, melanocytes, and germ cells but, importantly for ancestim, on a range of early to mature hematopoietic progenitor cells. Although ancestim shows only weak colony-stimulating activity in vitro, it acts in synergy with some other hematopoietic growth factors such as G-CSF, GM-CSF, erythropoietins, and IL-2 to stimulate multiple hematopoietic lineages in humans and some other animals. It also activates mast cells and stimulates melanocyte development and the production of pigment.",

Injection site reactions, occurring within 1\u201324 h, are the most commonly observed adverse events with up to 84 % of patients given ancestim showing mild-to-moderate reactions. Reported reactions consisted of erythema (59 %), pruritus (25 %), and urticaria (16 %) with occasional cases of hyperpigmentation and rash at the injection site. Erythema at a previous injection site has been seen in a few patients following an injection of ancestim at a different site. Rash, pruritus, and urticaria have occurred in 18 % of patients given ancestim/filgrastim and 5 % given ancestim alone. Other commonly seen reactions consisting of central/peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal, cardiac, and respiratory events following ancestim are listed in Table 5.2. Respiratory problems, mainly cough, pharyngitis, and dyspnea, affected 25 % of recipients of combination therapy and 14 % of those on ancestim alone. Systemic allergic reactions, generally moderate to severe but not life threatening, occur more often at higher dosages; at <30 \u03bcg/kg/day of ancestim, 5 % of patients had such a reaction while 27 % of patients given 30\u2013100 \u03bcg/kg/day had reactions. With regard to immunogenicity of ancestim, 23 of 258 (9 %) produced serum antibodies to the cytokine but no adverse clinical consequences, including a reduced therapeutic effect or serum sickness, have been recorded.",

            "text": "Cytokines have already had a revolutionary impact on our understanding of cellular functions and extracellular messaging but although their biological effects seem to offer great potential for the treatment of a wide range of human conditions, their pleiotropism, potency, and complexity to produce cytokine \u201ccocktails\u201d with signaling cascades and accompanying side effects, demands caution in attempts to introduce individual members into the clinic. The range of biological events set in motion even by individual cytokines, warns of the possibility of unwanted side effects and the resultant caution is reflected by the relatively small number of cytokines currently approved by regulatory agencies and reviewed here. Good examples of the sort of doubts that exist and why clinical developments proceed so cautiously have been illustrated with interferons, aldesleukin, becaplermin, palifermin, and bone morphogenetic proteins. A glance at Table 5.2 shows that 16 of the 23 listed FDA-approved cytokine preparations (19 different cytokines with four also in pegylated form) carry warnings with 10 of these being black box warnings. Having been used in human therapy for many years, interferon alfa preparations are well known for a number of often widely different, potentially serious side effects specified in boxed warnings. The diverse nature of these side effects including neuropsychiatric, autoimmune, ischemic, and infection adverse events, together with their therapeutic benefits, provides a good illustration of the two-edged nature of cytokine pleiotropism. Becaplermin, a growth factor, causes cell proliferation so the possibility of malignancy with its continued use needs to be kept in mind, especially in patients with known cancers. Likewise, palifermin, another growth factor and a valuable treatment for mucositis in cancer patients, has with it the potential for stimulation of tumor growth, especially since its complementary receptors occur widely on many different cell types in the body. Aldesleukin, the recombinant IL-2, is a potent activator of T lymphocytes and stimulates immune responses to cancer, producing regression of tumors in metastatic renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. However, this activity can also lead to a range of adverse cardiac and pulmonary events. Perhaps, the best example of the safety uncertainties and benefits-to-risk ratios associated with these heterogeneous, pleiotropic cell regulators, is seen with the bone morphogenetic proteins BMP-2 and BMP-7. Already with a troubled history of underreported adverse events, in the postmarketing period, these growth factors are currently a focus of attention and speculation as potential carcinogens. BMP-2 receptors are expressed on some tumor cells and increased rates of cancer following its use have been reported but, in keeping with the complexity of cytokine-induced responses, and the difficulty of ascribing many adverse effects to causes, tumor-suppressing effects, or no dependence, have also been reported.",

            "text": "\nCytokines, currently known to be more than 130 in number, are relatively small signaling proteins of MW < 30 kDa. They are usually glycosylated and produced by a variety of different cells including those of the immune system, epithelia, endothelia, and stroma. Cytokines are key modulators of the immune and inflammatory responses functioning in an autocrine, paracrine, or endocrine manner in infection, innate and adaptive immunity, autoimmunity, inflammation, and malignancy. Key to an understanding of these regulatory proteins is the recognition of their pleiotropism and sometimes overlapping activities, functional redundancies, and side effects.In the current genomic phase, cytokines are identified on the basis of homology with known, characterized cytokines. Many original names are still in use and many of the originally described \u201cfactors\u201d share receptors with other cytokines, for example, some interleukins.For the 23 FDA-approved cytokine products from the CDER-approved Biologic Products list, the cytokine classification presented is based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes.Nine main families are recognized with most of the cytokines of interest classified in the hematopoietic growth factor, interferon (IFN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) families. The approved cytokines are manufactured by recombinant DNA technology.Hematopoietin family: aldesleukin (rh-interleukin-2 [IL-2]), oprelvekin (rhIL-11), filgrastim and tbo-filgrastim (rh-granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]), sargramostim (rh-granulocyte macrophage [GM]-CSF), metreleptin (rh-leptin), rh-erythropoietins, epoetin and darbepoetin alfa, and stem cell factor (r-met-hSCF); IL-1 cytokine family: anakinra, a recombinant receptor antagonist for IL-1; interferon family: recombinant interferons alfa-1, alfa-2, beta-1, and gamma-1; PDGF family: palifermin (rh-keratinocyte growth factor [KGF]) and becaplermin (rhPDGF-BB); and TGF\u03b2 family: rh-bone morphogenetic protein [BMP]-2 and rhBMP-7.Interferons are a class of broad-spectrum antiviral cytokines with overlapping, but also some individual, activities. Of most interest for therapy are interferons alfa, beta, and gamma. Virtually all patients treated with interferon alfa experience some adverse effect(s) at some time during therapy.Interferon alfa preparations occasionally provoke an extensive range of adverse reactions including cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, hematologic, metabolic, urinary tract, and skin adverse events as well as adverse effects on the nervous and sensory systems.Peginterferon alfa-2a and peginterferon alfa-2b are covalent conjugates of the recombinant interferon with a single branched bis-monomethoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain. Pegylation helps to protect the protein from immune recognition and increases the molecule\u2019s size thus extending protein half-life and circulatory time and reducing renal clearance.Peginterferon alfa-2a together with ribavirin is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C in adults who have compensated liver disease and for patients infected with hepatitis C and HIV. Peginterferon alfa-2a alone is approved for patients with chronic hepatitis B.Interferon alfa-2b is administered extensively for hepatitis B and C as well as several malignancies.Interferon alfa-induced neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly depression, cognitive dysfunction, and mania are well known and have been intensively studied. Of the patients who develop severe depressive symptoms, most occur within the first 3 months of treatment. The incidence of depressive disorders is estimated to be 23\u201341 %. Symptoms may be prolonged for 6 months or more after the cessation of therapy.Autoantibodies and development or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases including hypothyroidism, immune-mediated hemolysis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Raynaud\u2019s disease, and mixed connective tissue disease are known to occur in response to interferon alfa therapy.Pegylated interferon alfa-2b has been associated with acute myocardial infarction, pericarditis, pericardial effusion with tamponade, and sick sinus syndrome producing arrhythmias.Interstitial lung disease, reported for both interferon alfa-2a and 2b, is seen more frequently with the former agent and with high doses of the latter. Cases of fatal interstitial pneumonitis, adult respiratory distress syndrome, and bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) following pegylated interferon alfa-2b are known.Interferon alfa may have adverse effects on the nervous system in the form of seizures in patients with no history of epilepsy, involuntary facial movements and weakness, features resembling multiple sclerosis, restless legs syndrome, sensorimotor polyneuropathy, and Bell\u2019s palsy.Adverse effects on sensory systems, mainly not only the eyes but also the ears, occur particularly to interferon alfa-2b. Ocular complications include occlusive vasculitis, central retinal artery occlusion, anterior ischemic optic retinopathy, retinal hemorrhage, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and optic nerve edema. Other ocular complications described in patients treated with interferon alfa-2b include permanent loss of sight due to combined retinal artery and central retinal vein obstruction; development of an epiretinal membrane; and the T-cell-mediated autoimmune syndrome, Vogt\u2013Koyanagi\u2013Harada disease.Endocrine effects of interferon alfa, best illustrated by thyroid dysfunction, may have an autoimmune mechanism. It occurs with an incidence of 5\u201314 % in patients treated for chronic hepatitis C. Hypothyroidism occurs more often than hyperthyroidism. Interferon alfa-2b can cause both conditions.Neutropenia induced by interferon alfa is fairly commonly seen. Other hematologic side effects include acute and autoimmune thrombocytopenia, pernicious anemia, bone marrow hypoplasia which may be immune mediated, and pure red cell aplasia.Renal complications to interferon alfa include renal thrombotic microangiopathy, acute nephrotic syndrome, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, renal insufficiency due to interstitial nephritis, tubular necrosis, and IgA nephropathy.The list of cutaneous reactions to interferon alfa is extensive and includes injection site reactions (erythema, necrosis, and vasculitis), pruritus, xerosis, urticaria, hyperpigmentation, psoriasis, alopecia, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, sarcoid nodules, eosinophilic fasciitis, livedo reticularis, vitiligo, and fixed drug eruption. Interferon alfa is well known for exacerbating pre-existing psoriasis but cases of new onset psoriasis occur with both interferon alfa-2a and interferon alfa-2b.A flu-like illness is the most commonly occurring adverse event following administration of interferon beta and injection site reactions are also common.Neutralizing antibodies are found in about a quarter of patients treated with subcutaneously administered interferon beta-1b and the consensus is that they neutralize or reduce the cytokine\u2019s activity. Other immunologic effects observed to both beta interferons are some cases of a lupus-like syndrome and cutaneous lymphocytic vasculitis.Unlike interferon alfa, results from studies do not support an association of interferon beta with depression but the FDA mention depression, suicide, and psychotic disorders in their warnings and precautions for the cytokine.Interferon beta can induce thyroid disorders notably hyperthyroidism and a severe case of hypothyroidism resembling Hashimoto\u2019s encephalopathy has been reported.Skin reactions include urticaria to interferon beta-1a and an acneiform eruption to interferon beta-1b.In 2014, the FDA granted approval for Plegridy\u00ae, a pegylated preparation of interferon beta-1a. Common adverse reactions to Plegridy\u00ae are similar to the nonpegylated form of the cytokine, viz., injection site reactions, an influenza-like illness, asthenia, arthralgia, and pruritus.Cardiovascular toxicity to interferon gamma, particularly at higher doses, include hypotension, arrhythmias, coronary vasospasm and ventricular tachycardia, and renal toxicity, namely acute renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, and tubular necrosis.The occurrence of fatal acute respiratory failure in some patients treated with interferon gamma-1b for advanced idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis prompted further investigation of the condition. No clear evidence for the involvement of interferon gamma-1b was found.Described as \u201cthe master regulators of granulocyte and macrophage populations,\u201d the colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are used to treat chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, mobilize stem cells for transplantation, and enhance the immune response to cancer. Currently, approved members of the CSF family are filgrastim and pegfilgrastim, both G-CSFs, sargramostim, a GM-CSF, and tbo-filgrastim, a short acting biosimilar G-CSF.CSF-induced adverse events are usually mild and transient including headache, bone pain, myalgia, fever, flushing, and rash. More severe, and rare, events are adult respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary toxicities, particularly pulmonary edema and interstitial pneumonitis, fluid retention, aortitis, capillary leak syndrome, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and spleen rupture. G-CSF may be a risk for the progression of myelodysplastic syndrome. Other potentially life-threatening responses to CSFs, the subject of warnings, are anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions and severe adverse events such as acute chest syndrome, vaso-occlusive episodes, multiorgan failure, and death seen in patients with sickle cell disease.There is a long list of adverse skin reactions provoked by CSFs. The most commonly occurring cutaneous reaction is Sweet\u2019s syndrome seen after therapy with sargramostim and filgrastim. Other adverse cutaneous events include psoriasis flare, pyogenic granulomas, pruritic erythematous maculopapular eruptions, palmoplantar pustulosis, erythema multiforme, and neutrophilic dermatoses.Recombinant human IL-11, or oprelvekin, is used to prevent chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and reduce the need for platelet transfusions in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies. Fluid retention and an increase in plasma volume underlie many of the adverse events, for example, edema, dyspnea, pleural effusions, arrhythmia, dilutional anemia, and renal failure, and indicate that oprelvekin should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure.Becaplermin is a recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a homodimer made up of two disulfide-bonded B chains and hence written as rhPDGF-BB.rhPDGF-BB promotes the growth of granulation tissue and wound healing via interaction with receptors on fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Becaplermin has therefore found use in gel form as a topical application for patients with difficult to heal diabetic neuropathic ulcers.The FDA has issued a boxed warning for becaplermin gel to the effect that becaplermin should be used with caution in patients with known malignancy and only used when the benefits can be expected to outweigh the risks.Palifermin, a recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor produced by mesenchymal cells and fibroblasts, stimulates differentiation, proliferation, and migration of epithelial cells via interaction with its complementary receptors on epithelial cells widely distributed in numerous tissues. Palifermin is an important agent in oncological supportive care, aiding the management of mucositis in cancer patients by protecting the mucosal epithelium and aiding its regeneration after chemotherapy- and radiation-induced injury.Adverse events following palifermin administration include rash, pruritus, erythema, paresthesia, edema, taste alteration, rhinitis, arthralgia, thickening of the tongue, and numbness. Numerous cutaneous reactions include acral erythema, a papulopustular eruption on the head and trunk, hyperpigmented papillomatous plaques in the axillae and inguinal areas, and a case of lichenoid papules. Being a growth factor, palifermin carries a warning of potential stimulation of tumor growth.Aldesleukin, a recombinant human IL-2, differs from the natural cytokine by absence of glycan residues and at position 125 and the end terminal amino acid. X-ray and NMR studies have shown that the IL-2 fold is similar to that seen in the myelopoietic-stimulatory factors G-CSF and GM-CSF.Cardiovascular adverse events are the main dose-limiting toxicities of aldesleukin with cases of hypotension, tachycardia, peripheral edema, pleural effusions, myocarditis, myocardial infarction, heart block, arrhythmias, cardiac eosinophilic infiltration, and coronary ischemic changes. Vascular leak syndrome causes hypovolemia, fluid accumulation in the extravascular spaces, oliguria, and pulmonary side effects. Hematologic adverse effects, particularly anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia occur but are rarely severe or dose limiting.Endocrine effects of aldesleukin usually manifest as hypothyroidism or, far less commonly, hyperthyroidism. Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported and IL-2-induced infectious toxicities, usually due to Staphylococcus, may occur at venous catheter sites. Neurological effects, especially to high doses during IL-2 therapy, include anxiety, depression, altered sleep patterns, somnolence, emotional fragility, vivid dreams, and confusion.The list of aldesleukin-induced cutaneous reactions is extensive, ranging from mild erythema, pruritus, injection site reactions and vitiligo, to urticaria, angioedema, reactivation of eczema, exacerbation of psoriasis, generalized erythema followed by desquamation, vasculitis, and severe manifestations like pemphigus, IgA bullous dermatosis, and toxic epidermal necrolysis.Anakinra is a recombinant specific receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) for IL-1 differing from the natural receptor by the addition of a single methionine at the amino terminal end. Anakinra acts as a biological response modifier in the treatment of diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and the spectrum of autoinflammatory syndromes collectively known as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS).The most common adverse events to anakinra are injection site reactions which occur in up to 73 % of patients and infection episodes. Other reported side effects include progression of rheumatoid arthritis, exacerbation of Crohn\u2019s disease, anaphylaxis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, ARDS, an interstitial granulomatous reaction, and some severe skin reactions.The main adverse effects of epoetin (rhEPO) in anemic patients with end-stage renal disease are myalgias, iron deficiency, elevated blood pressure, and seizures. Hypertension is a common side effect with approximately one-third of dialysis patients affected and hypertension and increased viscosity due to rhEPO may lead to encephalopathy, convulsions, cerebral edema, and seizures. Controlled studies on cancer patients revealed a higher risk of thromboembolic events with rhEPO therapy than controls.Cerebral ischemia with increased metabolic rate and blood viscosity is a potentially severe side effect of EPO. EPO receptors have been demonstrated in tumor tissue and the cytokine may assist with tumor angiogenesis, suggesting the possibility of EPO initiating tumor growth or aiding tumor progression.Both epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa carry a boxed warning related to a possible increased risk of death, cardiac, and thromboembolic events and tumor progression or recurrence.In cases of transfusion-dependent pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) with neutralizing serum antibodies to EPO, patients should not be switched to another epoetin such as darbepoetin alfa since a systemic anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid response mediated by anti-EPO antibodies cross-reactive antibodies may result.An investigation of the effect of darbepoetin alfa in anemic patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure revealed three main adverse events: neurological signs and symptoms, upper respiratory tract infections, and joint-related signs and symptoms.Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are growth factors inducing the formation of bone and cartilage and important signaling proteins in some disease states such as adenocarcinoma and the progression of colon cancer. BMP-2 and BMP-7 promote the differentiation of osteoblasts and, on the basis of this action, recombinant forms of both cytokines (rhBMP-2 and rhBMP-7) are approved by the FDA for specific uses in orthopedic, oral, and maxillofacial surgery and implant dentistry although up to 85 % of their usage is said to be off-label.Recent results with rhBMP-2 indicate a much higher incidence of side effects and complications than originally reported. Identification of previously unpublished adverse effects, study inconsistencies, and a comparative review of FDA material has revealed an adverse events frequency associated with rhBMP-2 in spine fusion of 10\u201350 %. Reported adverse events were swelling, fluid collection, osteolysis, pain/radiculopathy, heterotropic bone, pseudarthrosis, surgical site infections and other wound complications, thromboembolic events, respiratory distress, and cancer.In an examination of the prevalence and complications of BMP use in spinal fusion procedures, the following complications were identified: vertebral osteolysis, graft migration, graft subsidence, formation of neutralizing antibodies to BMP-2, ectopic/heterotopic bone formation, and hematoma.Concern for the carcinogenic potential of rhBMP-2 was reinforced by a 2010 FDA Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Devices Advisory Panel report on the Amplify\u2122 rhBMP-2 matrix of increased cancer rates among BMP-2-treated patients. At \u226460 months cancer incidences were patients 5 % and controls 2.1 %. Other studies have reported tumor-enhancing, tumor-suppressing, or no dependence effects.rhBMP-7, also known as osteogenic protein 1 (OP-1), is a multifunctional growth factor. Apart from an FDA Public Health Notification of life-threatening complications associated with rhBMP (including rhBMP-7, in cervical spine fusion), and the reminder that rhBMPs are contraindicated in skeletally immature or pregnant patients and those with hypersensitivity to the protein, studies on, and reports of, adverse events to BMP-7 are not yet extensive.In a clinical trial designed to evaluate rhBMP-7 in the treatment of tibial reunions, adverse events were mild or moderate and nonserious, for example, fever, nausea, vomiting, leg edema and discomfort, and hematoma at the operative site. Low levels of anti-BMP-7 antibodies were detected in 10 % of the treated patients, but all titers were low with no related adverse events.Leptin, a 167 amino acid protein of MW 16 kDa produced primarily by adipocytes, helps to control energy homeostasis and body weight by adjusting hunger and energy expenditure to regulate fat stores. It also regulates some neuroendocrine functions and other physiological processes. Metreleptin, a recombinant analog of leptin is used as replacement therapy to treat leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired generalized lipodystrophy. It is not to be used in patients with general obesity, for HIV-related lipodystrophy or in patients with metabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus) without concurrent generalized lipodystrophy.Neutralizing antibodies may develop to metreleptin. Because of this, the possibility of worsening of renal disease, and the occurrence of T-cell lymphoma in patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy, the protein is only available under the Myalept Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy Program.Ancestim is a recombinant human stem cell factor (SCF) important for hematopoiesis, spermatogenesis, and melanogenesis. It acts in synergy with some other hematopoietic growth factors such as G-CSF, GM-CSF, erythropoietins, and IL-2 to stimulate multiple hematopoietic lineages.Together with filgrastim, ancestim should only be administered to patients who are at risk of inadequate peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) mobilization. Ancestim is used with filgrastim to effect a sustained mobilization of PBPCs and achieve a reduction in the number of apheresis required. Care should be exercised in the simultaneous use of the cytokine combination in patients given chemo/radiotherapy; administration should be avoided 24 h before and after the cytotoxic therapy.Patients with a history of anaphylaxis, asthma, recurrent urticaria, angioedema, and mast cell diseases such as systemic mastocytosis who are to be given ancestim may be at particular risk and should be premedicated with H1 and H2 antihistamines and a bronchodilator.The range of biological events set in motion even by individual cytokines, warns of the possibility of unwanted side effects and the resultant caution is reflected by the relatively small number of cytokines currently approved by regulatory agencies. Sixteen of the 23 listed FDA-approved cytokine preparations carry warnings with ten of these being black box warnings.The diverse nature of interferon side effects, including neuropsychiatric, autoimmune, ischemic, and infection adverse events, together with their therapeutic benefits, provides a good illustration of the two-edged nature of cytokine pleiotropism. Despite this, cytokine adverse events profiles do not generally negate benefits and sometimes observed toxicities may even correspond with improved outcomes.\n",
