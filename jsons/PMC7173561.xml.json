Evolution pervades nature. Thanks to new theories and to the availability of powerful instruments, new experimental procedures, and increasing computing power\u2014which together constitute the very roots of scientific progress\u2014we know that the physical and biological worlds are constantly evolving. Several classes of energy have gradually shaped matter and living entities, basically as the outcome of random events and Darwinian natural selection in its broadest sense. The identification of DNA as the genetic material and the advent of genomics in the second half of the twentieth century unveiled an astonishing degree of diversity within the living world that derives mainly from combinations of four classes of nucleotides. Biodiversity, a term coined by O. Wilson in 1984 and emphasized by T. Lovejoy and others, is a feature of all living beings, be differentiated multicellular organisms, single-cell organisms, or subcellular genetic elements, among them the viruses. Next-generation sequencing methods developed at the beginning of the 21st century allow thousands of sequences from the same biological sample (a microbial community in a soil or ocean sample, a tumor, or an infected host) to be determined. These procedures have documented the presence of myriads of variants in a \u201csingle biological entity\u201d or in \u201ccommunities of biological entities.\u201d Differences extend to individuals that belong to the same biological group, be it Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster, Escherichia coli, or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). No exceptions have been described. Diversity is extensive and not restricted to the genotypic level. It also affects phenotypic traits.",

            "text": "During decades, in the first half of the twentieth century, population genetics had as one of its tenets that genetic variation due to mutation had for the most part been originated in a remote past. It was generally thought that the present-day diversity was essentially brought about by the reassortment of chromosomes during sexual reproduction. This view was weakened by the discovery of extensive genetic polymorphisms, first in Drosophila and humans, through secondary analyses of electrophoretic mobility of enzymes, detected by in situ activity assays to yield zymograms that were displayed as electromorphs. These early studies on allozymes were soon extended to other organisms. Assuming that no protein modifications had specifically occurred in some individuals, the results suggested the presence of several different (allelic) forms of a given gene among individuals of the same species, be it humans, insects, or bacteria. In the absence of information on DNA nucleotide sequences, the first estimates of heterogeneity from the numbers of electromorphs were collated with the protein sequence information available. An excellent review of these developments (Selander, 1976) ended with the following premonitory sentence on the role of molecular biology in unveiling evolutionarily relevant information: \u201cConsidering the magnitude of this effect, we may not be overfanciful to think that future historians will see molecular biology more as the salvation for than, as it first seemed, the nemesis of evolutionary biology.\u201d",

The number of different viruses and their dissimilarity in shape and behavior is astounding. Current estimates indicate that the total number of virus particles in our biosphere reaches 1032, exceeding by one order of magnitude the total number of cells. Viruses are found in surface and deep-sea and lake waters, below the Earth surface, in any type of soil, in deserts, and in most environments designated as extreme regarding ionic conditions (i.e., hypersaline) and temperature (thermophilic) (Breitbart et al., 2004, Villarreal, 2005, Lopez-Bueno et al., 2009; Box 1.1\n). The viruses that have been studied are probably a minimal and biased representation of those that exist, with at least hundred thousand mammalian viruses awaiting discovery (Anthony et al., 2013, Epstein and Anthony, 2017). This is because high-throughput screening procedures have only recently become available, and also because prevention of disease has provided the main incentive to study viruses. Disease-associated viruses are those most described in the scientific literature.\nBox 1.1Some Numbers Concerning Viruses in the Earth Biosphere\n\u2022Total number of viral particles: \u223c 1032. This is 10 times more than cells, and they are equivalent to 2 \u00d7 108 tons of carbon.\u2022Virus particles in 1 cm3 of seawater: \u223c 108.\u2022Virus particles in 1 m3 of air: \u223c 2 \u00d7 106 to 40 \u00d7 106.\u2022Rate of viral infections in the oceans: \u223c 1 \u00d7 1023/s.\u2022A string with the viruses on Earth would be about \u223c2 \u00d7 108 light-years long (\u223c1.9 \u00d7 1024\n m).

These subjects have as a common thread that Darwinian natural selection has an immediate imprint on them, observable in the time scale of days or even hours. The capacity for rapid evolution displayed by viruses represents an unprecedented and often underappreciated development in biology: the direct observation of Darwinian principles at play within short times.\n",

In this book evolution will be used in its broader sense to mean any change in the genetic composition of a virus over time, irrespective of the time frame involved, and the transience of the change. We treat as evolution both the genome variation that poliovirus has undergone from the middle of the 20th century to present days and the changes that the same virus undergoes within an infected individual. It is remarkable that only a few decades ago virus evolution (or for that matter microbial evolution in general) was not considered a significant factor in viral pathogenesis. Evolution was largely overlooked in the planning of strategies for microbial disease control. A lucid historical account of the different perceptions of virus evolution, including early evidence of phenotypic variation of viruses, with emphasis on the impact of the complexity of RNA virus populations, was written by J.J. Holland (2006). Despite having been largely ignored by virologists, the present book was partly stimulated by the conviction that the concept of complexity is pertinent to the understanding of viruses at the population level, having direct connections with viral disease and disease control.",

The 2017 report from International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) divides viruses into 10 Orders, and each of them is subdivided into several families, subfamilies, genera, species, and isolates (https://talk.ictvonline.org/), and each isolate includes a multitude of variants. The task of classifying viruses meets with considerable hurdles and requires periodic revisions by the ICTV, an organization whose role has been essential to provide conceptual order in the vast viral world. One of its objectives is the assignment of newly discovered viruses to the adequate group. A remarkable number of isolates remain unclassified, an echo of the natural diversity of viruses, even among the limited subset that has been isolated and characterized.",

The nucleic acids written in the four schemes are those involved in the flow of genetic information (indicated by arrows), not in gene expression since all of them use messenger RNA (mRNA) for virus-specific protein synthesis. Mistakes in the form of misincorporation of nucleotides during the replication steps indicated by arrows are transmitted to progeny genomes. RNAs produced by transcription to serve solely as mRNAs are essential for gene expression and virus multiplication, but misincorporations in such transcripts are not transmitted to progeny. It could be considered that some mRNA molecules when synthesized from the corresponding RNA or DNA template may acquire mutations and that these mutated molecules (e.g., an mRNA encoding a viral polymerase), when translated, may produce a polymerase with lower copying fidelity that will evoke additional mutations; we will ignore this possibility since a single mRNA molecule should have a rather limited contribution to the overall genetic variation of a replicating virus population with thousands of polymerase and template molecules in the replication complexes (or replication factories).",

However, RNA viruses that replicate entirely via RNA templates (Group 1 in Fig. 1.1); retroviruses (Group 2); and the hepadnaviruses (Group 4) display salient genetic plasticity, mainly in the way of a high rate of introduction of point mutations (Chapter 2). Their mutability may be an inheritance of universal flexibility that probably characterized primitive RNA or RNA-like molecules, thought to have populated an ancestral RNA world at an early stage of life on Earth (Section 1.4.2). Thus, the presence of RNA at any place in the replicative schemes (Group 1, 2, and 4 in Fig. 1.1) implies error-prone replication and the potential of very rapid evolution. \u201cPotential\u201d must be underlined because high error rates do not necessarily result in rapid long-term evolution in nature (Chapter 7).",

Evolutionary theory predicts that high-fidelity polymerase machinery is necessary to maintain the informational stability of complex genomes (those that carry a large amount of genetic information).

In turn, interhost (long-term) virus diversification can result from selection acting on variants generated by mutation, recombination or reassortment, and random sampling events (independent of selection) within hosts and in host-to-host transmission, or their combined effects (Chapters 2 and 3Chapter 2Chapter 3).",

How such minor changes in viruses can have major biological consequences may relate to the historical role of viruses in an evolving, ancestral, pre-cellular biosphere.

However, early work by L. Orgel and his colleagues documented that polynucleotides could be synthesized from activated nucleotides in the absence of an enzyme (Miller and Orgel, 1974), and recent work has established that there are multiple chemical pathways for abiotic and nonenzymatic nucleotide synthesis (Adamala and Szostak, 2013, Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2014). Mineral surfaces (clay minerals, zeolites, manganates, hydroxides, etc.) have been proposed as key participants in the origin of life, by providing scaffolds for the synthesis of nucleotide and amino acid polymers (Bernal, 1951, Gedulin and Arrhenius, 1994, Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2014, Nakashima et al., 2018, Pedreira-Segade et al., 2018)). The relevant features of clays are their adsorption power, ordered structure, capacity to concentrate organic compounds, and ability to serve as polymerization templates. Adsorption onto mineral surfaces may lower the activation energy of intermolecular reactions. Minerals with an excess positive charge on their surfaces might have played a role in the evolution of RNA-like or RNA-precursor molecules. It has been suggested that mineral-organic complexes (chimeras between materials once thought to belong to unmixable categories) could have been the first living organisms endowed with a genetic program (Cairns-Smith, 1965).",

Polymer formation could have also been facilitated by heating and drying, with key involvement of the dried phases in catalysis (Towe, 1994, Horneck and Baumstark-Khan, 2002). On different clay types, nucleotides and amino acid polymers of dozens of residues have been synthesized, providing a realistic scenario for a transition toward primitive self-replicating entities (Ferris et al., 1996). One of the first episodes of Darwinian positive selection could have operated prebiologically through differential surface binding, followed by the selection of autocatalytic heteropolymers (Tkachenko and Maslov, 2018).

The prebiotic synthesis of potential building blocks\u2014which might have been initiated earlier than 5000 million years ago\u2014renders plausible the existence of a pre-RNA era that was then replaced by an RNA world in the late Hadean early Archean periods on Earth. This stage should have been followed by one in which RNA was complemented by DNA as a repository of genetic information (Bywater, 2012). Polymers other than DNA and RNA are also capable of encoding evolvable inheritable information (Pinheiro et al., 2012, Robertson and Joyce, 2012). Heterogeneous nucleic acid molecules (including mixtures of ribo- and deoxyribo-polymers) can give rise to functional nucleic acids (Gilbert, 1986, Lazcano, 1994a, Gesteland et al., 2006, Derr et al., 2011, Szostak, 2011, Trevino et al., 2011). RNA enzymes (ribozymes), such as RNA ligases can evolve from random-sequence RNAs (Joyce, 2004, Sczepanski and Joyce, 2014). The critical polymerization reaction involves the formation of a phosphodiester bond and release of pyrophosphate\u2014analogous to the reactions catalyzed by the present-day RdRps\u2014and represent an incipient, primitive anabolism (Eigen, 1992, Lazcano, 1994a, Orgel, 2002, Orgel, 2004, Dworkin et al., 2003, Joshi et al., 2011). In support of a possible link between catalytic RNA activities and solid mineral surfaces in the origin of life (as summarized in Section 1.4.1), the catalytic activity of the hammerhead ribozyme of the Avocado Sun Blotch viroid was maintained when bound to the clay mineral montmorillonite (Biondi et al., 2007).",

The inherently low copying fidelity of the putative ribozyme polymerases, estimated in 10\u22122 to 10\u22124 errors per nucleotide copied (Wochner et al., 2011) should have ensured genetic variation for selection to act upon variant RNA molecules. Chirality (the existence of two mirror images or enantiomers of a molecule) poses a challenge for the chemical origin of biological molecules (Caglioti et al., 2011, Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2014, Sczepanski and Joyce, 2014). Present-day biological systems use only d-ribose (d from \u201cdextro\u201d or rotation of the plane of polarized light to the right) while chemical condensation reactions produce equal amounts of the d- and l- (levo) forms. Nonenzymatic template-dependent reactions can be inhibited by the incorrect enantiomer. This led to the proposal that analogs devoid of enantiomeric forms, such as glycerol derivatives, could have been the basis of the most primitive genetic systems (Schwartz and Orgel, 1985). Theoretical studies support the notion that initial achiral conditions can evolve toward chirality, in what has been defined as an extension of punctuated equilibrium to prebiological evolution (Gleiser et al., 2008).",

Contemporary catalytic RNAs (found in the ribosome, as part of some protein complexes, and in some viroids), as well as nucleotide-like coenzymes, have been regarded as possible molecular remnants of a primitive RNA world (Lazcano, 1994a). Some authors consider the possibility that cells whose genetic material is made of RNA (Forterre, 2005) may still hide in some remote sites of our planet (Yarus, 2010). For a transition from a purely RNA (or RNA-like) world to an extended scenario with the participation of proteins, the presence of a transfer RNA (tRNA) quasispecies and the generation of a genetic code endowed with evolutionary potential must have been critical (Eigen, 1992, Koonin and Novozhilov, 2017). Initial theories of how the genetic code might have arisen were put forward by F. Crick, L. Orgel, and C. Woese in the middle of the twentieth century. Main proposals included a stereochemical fit between some amino acids and the corresponding bases (or codons to be), progressive evolution from a one nucleotide to a three nucleotides code, gradual incorporation of amino acids in the coding system, and the frozen accident model of codon universality (for a review of early concepts, see Crick, 1968). New insights on the code origin have come from integrating the knowledge of the mechanisms of protein synthesis with likely events in the RNA world. Primitive tRNA quasispecies (existing around 4000 million years ago, late Hadean, early Archean, Fig. 1.3) and tRNA aminoacylating ribozymes should have evolved to fit the genetic code, which was later expanded in coevolution with the translation machinery (Szathmary, 1999, Rodin et al., 2011, Caetano-Anolles et al., 2013). The age of the genetic code has been estimated in 3.8 \u00b1 0.5 thousand million years (Eigen, 2013), and the present code structure is remarkably redundant. Effects of redundancy are to minimize the deleterious effects of mutations, and to contribute to flexibility of functional involvement of mRNA secondary structure (Shabalina et al., 2006, Koonin and Novozhilov, 2017; see also Chapter 2).",

            "text": "The most salient attributes of living matter are reproduction, evolvability, energy conversion (metabolism), and compartmentalization. What selective forces might have led to the integration of these features? Concerning reproduction, there must have been a critical transition from the absence of any inheritable instruction (despite the presence of primitive polymers) to the first molecules endowed with \u201cinheritable\u201d information, for example, a macromolecule capable of self-copying. Such a molecule should have had an immense selective advantage over surrounding macromolecular peers devoid of the capacity for reproduction. The transition from \u201cno inheritable information\u201d to \u201cinheritable information\u201d is essential for the origin of life. Current evidence suggests that the process that allowed such critical transformation was slow and inaccurate. Slow because the catalytic RNAs selected in the laboratory are about 10 million-fold slower than most protein enzymes (Jeffares et al., 1998, Yarus, 2010). Inaccurate because preenzymatic nucleotide polymerization would rarely display error rates below 10\u22121 to 10\u22122 mutations per nucleotide copied (Inoue and Orgel, 1983). No \u201cpredators\u201d such as degrading enzymes were present to impede a slow accumulation of variant replicating molecules. The slow sequence exploration might have taken place in microenvironments shielded from damaging radiation until points in sequence space compatible with self-organization, replication, and adaptation were encountered. The adaptive potential of mutant distributions of polynucleotides is a key concept in the quasispecies theory of the origin of life (Eigen and Schuster, 1979), and a signature of present-day viruses (Chapter 3). Replicative inaccuracy and heterogeneity appear as recurrent requirements for the major transitions and adaptability of the forms generated in the course of prebiological and biological evolution. Once a primitive molecular \u201cmemory\u201d was implemented, in the words of M. Eigen: \u201c \u2026.information generates itself in feedback loops via replication and selection, the objective being \u2018to be or not to be\u2019\u201d (Eigen, 1994, Eigen, 2013).

That is, the genomic RNA determines phenotypic traits, independently of its protein-coding activity, for example, through its involvement in RNA-RNA and RNA-protein interactions. \u201cPriming\u201d of polynucleotide synthesis, in the sense as we know it today, should not have been a limitation since circular RNA or RNA-like molecules could fold partially to prime their own copying. The term \u201creplicon\u201d currently refers to any genetic element that encodes sufficient information to be copied (i.e., viruses, plasmids, etc.), even if the copying is carried out by (or in conjunction with) elaborate cell-dependent machinery. Virtual replicons are used in computer simulations to learn about the dynamics of natural living systems (Adami, 1998, Eigen, 2013).",

The sun was about 25%\u201330% less luminous than the present-day sun, yet it produced more ultraviolet (UV) light. Due to the absence of oxygen and ozone layer, the UV radiation that reached the Earth was 10- to 100-fold more intense than today, with the difference being accentuated for the radiation in the 200\u2013280 nm range. Studies of the conversion of UV radiation into DNA-damage equivalents suggest a two to three logarithm larger biologically relevant UV radiation during the time of the putative RNA world as compared with today\u2019s radiation (Canuto et al., 1982, Chang, 1994, Horneck and Baumstark-Khan, 2002). In such an environment, radiation-related mutational input could have had drastic effects on replicating entities in ways that can be only roughly anticipated from the present-day chemistry. Even the simplest present-day RNA genetic systems, despite their small target size, would undergo severe radiation damage. Reconstruction of protein enzyme-free nucleic acid synthesis under the radiation conditions prevalent on Earth during the RNA world development, during late Hadean and early Archean eras, offers a fascinating challenge and opportunity of experimental research for the rising field of Astrobiology.",

One of these proposals is that the formation of pyrite from hydrogen sulfide was used by primitive cells as an energy source, resulting from reactions such as FeS + H2S \u2192 FeS2 + 2H++ 2e\u2212 (W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user, 1994). Positive charges on pyrite crystals could accumulate negatively charged molecules (e.g., the products of CO2 fixation) and undergo reductive reactions. The system might have selected surface-bound polymers rather than monomers, and given rise to biochirality (selection of one enantiomeric form over another) because of the chiral structure of pyrite (W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user, 1988). Then, an evolution toward an Archean carbon-fixation cycle would occur, a precursor of the metabolic cycles found in present-day archaeal and bacterial organisms (Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2014). The picture may have been more complex, as judged by the success of mixotrophic organisms which are capable of switching from phototrophy (light-mediated break-down of CO2 for their metabolism) to heterotrophy in some extreme environments of the present-day Earth (Laybourn-Parry and Pearce, 2007).",

Here a second decisive positive selection event might have entered the scene at the stage of formation of proto-cells and the first individual cells (3600\u20133200 million years ago, Fig. 1.3; Eigen, 1992). Lipid bilayers endowed with a splitting capacity should have been strongly selected at this stage of life development because of their power to spread. This underlines the concept that Darwinian selection need not be associated exclusively with template-copying processes. Membrane traffic and reorganizations are essential for the life cycle of many present-day viruses (Huotari and Helenius, 2011). Virus particle stability and capacity to spread, associated with membrane capture and interactions, might have derived from the early genomes that exploited membrane-based organelles to achieve functional diversification. Compartmentalization is considered one of the key developments to initiate a cell-based life (Morowitz, 1992, Hanczyc and Monnard, 2017).",

As the Greek poet Konstantinos Kevafis once wrote, Odysseus should be grateful not because he was able to return home, but on what he learned on his way back to Ithaka. It is the journey that matters\u201d (Lazcano, 1994b; for a general overview of the history of life on Earth, centered in paleontology, see Cowen, 2005).",

Influenced by the discovery of bacteriophages by F. d\u2019Herelle, J.B.S. Haldane proposed viruses as intermediates between the prebiotic soup and primitive cells (reviewed in Lazcano, 2010). In those times, knowledge of viruses was superficial from today\u2019s perspective, and lent to daring proposals coherent with viruses being perceived as simple. Despite simplicity and replication being features that could be also be attributed to primitive life forms, we have to distinguish the role that virus-like entities might have played in the establishment of early life from the possibility that present-day viruses reflect how early life might have been.",

HDV is dependent on hepatitis B virus (HBV) for the completion of its infectious cycle (Taylor and Pelchat, 2010). The HDV genome is a mosaic RNA consisting of a viroid-like RNA and an RNA region whose complementary RNA (antigenomic strand) encodes two forms of a structural protein termed the delta antigen. Both the genomic and antigenomic RNAs possess a strong secondary structure with about 70% paired nucleotides. The delta antigen is encapsidated by the HBV surface antigen as a component of HDV particles. Thus, HDV appears to be the result of an RNA conjunction between a viroid-like RNA and an mRNA-coding region. Such conjoined RNAs might have been the precursors of the modern eukaryotic genome partition into coding sequences (exons) and intervening sequences (introns) (Sharp, 1985, Robertson, 1992, Robertson, 1996, Chao, 2007, Taylor and Pelchat, 2010). The structure of the HDV genome seems to echo processes that originated with primitive RNAs selected for their ability to replicate that incorporated a protein-coding moiety through recombination with other RNAs. Replication-competent and protein-coding chimeras might have signaled a relevant intermediate step toward more complex RNA and DNA genomes. The advent of an enzyme that could copy RNA into DNA to carry out reverse transcription should have been instrumental in generating primitive DNA viruses and other DNA-based genomes of increased complexity (Lazcano et al., 1992).",

The observation that some \u201cinfectious cells\u201d can be disseminated by insects provides a model for an early origin of arthropod-borne viruses. It has been recognized that transmission of the virus from an infected cell into a recipient cell need not involve a prolonged stay of the virus in the extracellular environment. Infection \u201csynapses\u201d allow intimate cell-to-cell contacts through which virus transmission takes place. It is estimated that synapse-mediated transmission maybe 100-fold more efficient than the transmission of viral particles released into the extracellular environment. This is one of several mechanisms of bloc (multiple particles) transmission, which has several implications for viral quasispecies dynamics (Chapter 3). Acquisition of capacity for long-range transmission in space and time should have provided a sufficient selective advantage for a \u201ccell-to-external environment-to-cell\u201d transmission to coexist with \u201ccell-to-cell\u201d transmission in our biosphere.",

The structure and functions of many viral proteins do not deviate in any salient way from cellular counterparts. This applies to proteins involved in genome replication, and in proteolytic processing of proteins and polyprotein precursors. In contrast, the \u201cvirus innate self\u201d that groups viral proteins and protein folds not shared with cellular counterparts, and that provides a powerful argument for a virus origin independent from cells (Section 1.5.1), does not exclude a coevolutionary mechanism even if all modules were not common to cellular and viral entities over a several million years period (see section 1.7). Comparative genomics suggests that the exchange of functional and structural modules through lateral gene transfers, together with fine adjustments mediated by mutation, have contributed to the coadaptation of cells and autonomous replicons over ancient evolutionary periods (Gorbalenya, 1995, Holland and Domingo, 1998, Jalasvuori and Bamford, 2008, Villarreal, 2008). Even mechanisms that prompt viral variation in cell tropism (Chapter 4) have parallels in differentiated organism As an example, a two amino acids insertion into ectodysplasin\u2014a member of the tumor necrosis-binding family\u2014alters its receptor specificity, and the differential expression of the two protein versions plays a role in epidermal morphogenesis (Yan et al., 2000). Furthermore, as the number of three-dimensional structures for viral cellular enzymes has increased to reach thousands, structural similarities between key cellular and viral enzymes (polymerases, proteases) have become apparent.",

Regulatory strategies were also likely shared by cells and viruses. Small micro-RNAs that now populate the cellular world can act as molecular switches for RNA viral genomes to modulate their replication and gene expression (van Rij and Andino, 2008, Diaz-Toledano et al., 2009).

Their transfer to lower temperatures might have modulated their permeability prior to the stage at which peptide or protein transporters were inserted as membrane components. Here again, \u201cheterogeneities\u201d became important: membranes made of mixtures of amphiphiles display increased thermostability, permeability, and tolerance to divalent cations. Budding vesicles endowed with traits such as growth, division, and permeability should have been positively selected for their ability to spread favorable replicating molecules and mediators of protocellular functions. Selected protoviral vesicles became gradually dispensable for the spreading of beneficial genes, and viruses evolved from being solely beneficial entities into also displaying a parasitic behavior that exploited cell resources (compare with 1.7, 1.8). According to this model, when cells became independent units surrounded by lipid-based membranes, viruses promoted the selection of cells that expressed peptidoglycan molecules on their surface to decrease or prevent virus infection. This transition could mark the onset of an arms race behavior that has been associated with a survival strategy of many present-day viruses. A cell wall allowed vertical transmission of genetic information and rendered the cell metabolically independent. In addition, it provided an osmotic environment suitable for energy production. Genetic information and molecular devices for energy capture, storage, and use were equally important for a sustainable cellular organization. Thus, according to this theory, viruses originated from protoviral elements whose main function was to spread useful genes horizontally. The evolved viruses acted as selective agents to promote microbial evolution and then became established in an increasingly differentiated cellular world (Villarreal, 2005, Villarreal, 2008, Hendrix, 2008, Jalasvuori and Bamford, 2008).",

They are diverse regarding the genetic material that can be single-stranded or double-stranded RNA or DNA. They can be either asymptomatic, produce disease, or modify critical host traits, such as virulence, again reflecting a broad range of host interactions observed with other viral groups. The presence of a dsRNA mycovirus in a fungus is essential for the latter to confer heat tolerance to some plants; these findings have defined a three-way symbiosis required for an important phenotypic trait (Marquez et al., 2007, Roossinck, 2013) (see also Section 1.7.3).",

According to this view, viruses, together with other subcellular genetic elements (plasmids, retroelements, etc.), penetrated the genetic material of ancestral cell forms, acted as agents of lateral gene transfers, and modified the expression profiles of the recipient cells. Probably, there has been (and there still is) a constant flow of genes between cells and viruses and other mobile genetic elements. The abundance of endogenous retroviruses in the mammalian genomes (Garc\u00eda-Montojo et al., 2018) is a clear symptom of such a genetic flow. A nonfunctional viral infectivity factor (Vif) [the HIV-1 protein that can counteract the mutagenic activity of the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing complex (APOBEC) proteins; see Section 2.7 in Chapter 2] was found in the remnant of a rabbit endogenous retrovirus termed rabbit endogenous lentivirus type K (Katzourakis et al., 2007). About 8% of the human genome is made of retroviral-like elements. Present-day human endogenous retroviruses probably contribute to pluripotency of human cells (Santoni et al., 2012), and genome regulation (Chuong, 2018). The fusion of cells from the placenta is mediated by syncytin, a protein in HERV-W endogenous retroviruses (Chuong, 2018, Villarreal, 2005).",

Also, viruses could favor the survival of some cell types over others, based on differential cell susceptibility to virus infection, thus contributing to cellular diversification. The need to escape viral infection may have furnished novel cell surface receptor proteins through a selection of cellular escape mutants (Buckling and Rainey, 2002, Saren et al., 2005). Some experimental systems consisting of persistently infected cells in which the cells and the resident virus coevolve (Chapter 6) illustrate how viruses could act as selective agents to promote cellular variation.

Temperate bacteriophages (the prototypic example being E. coli phage \u03bb) integrate their genomic DNA in the DNA of their host bacteria. The uptake of cellular genes by viruses has been amply documented in transducing bacteriophages (those that can transfer DNA from one bacterium to another), as well as in RNA and DNA tumor viruses. Even RNA viruses that are not known to include a reverse transcription step in their replication cycle can incorporate host RNA sequences. Replication-competent, cytopathic variants of bovine viral diarrhea virus (a type species of the genus Pestivirus of the important family of pathogens Flaviviridae) can acquire cellular mRNA sequences in their genome, via nonhomologous recombination (Meyers et al., 1989). Insertion of 28S ribosomal RNA sequences into the hemagglutinin gene of influenza virus increased its pathogenicity (Khatchikian et al., 1989). Some defective-interfering particles of Sindbis virus included cellular tRNA sequences at their 5\u2032-ends (Monroe and Schlesinger, 1983). Sequences related to some flaviviruses can persist in an integrated form into the DNA of the insect vectors Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti (Crochu et al., 2004). Endogenous hepatitis B viruses (eHBVs) have been identified in the genomes of birds and land vertebrates (amniotes), crocodilians, snakes, and turtles. The evidence is that eHBVs are more than 207 million years old and that ancient HBV-like viruses infected animals during the Mesozoic Era (Suh et al., 2014, Fig. 1.4). The existence of alternative mechanisms for the integration of viral genetic material into cellular DNA suggests an ancient origin and a selective advantage of exchanges of genetic information in shaping a diverse and adaptable cellular world (Eigen, 1992, Eigen, 2013, Gibbs et al., 1995, Villarreal, 2005, Villarreal, 2008).",

Alternatively, symbiotic and mutualistic interactions might have been the norm, only interrupted by occasional defections by killer personalities that have become the key actors of hospital wards and virology textbooks (Roossinck, 2011, Li and Delwart, 2011). As discussed in connection with natural counterparts of the transition toward error catastrophe in viruses (Chapter 9), cellular editing activities such as those displayed by some of the adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA and APOBEC proteins are also part of the innate immune response against some viruses. In turn, viruses have evolved multiple functions to counteract the host immune response (Chapter 4). The recruiting of cellular functions to confront viruses attests of transient losses of an equilibrated coexistence. Some middle- and long-term equilibrium between virus and host population numbers must be continuously restored by selective events; otherwise, this book would not have been written.",

Exclusion has a biochemical interpretation in the competition of two viral entities for cellular resources, but it might have been boosted by early cellular adaptation to limit viral invasions (Chapter 4). Likewise, components of the intrinsic and innate immune response that prevent infection and disease might have also been endowed with activities that promoted cell variation for adaptability.",

            "text": "The two opposite views of the activity of viruses in the biosphere (i.e., opportunistic occupation of any suitable cellular niche or intimate cooperative coevolution with host cells) would be expected to produce a different proportion of pathogenic viruses. Opportunistic invasions should lead mainly to disease-prone viruses, while long coevolutionary periods should lead to a dominance of nonpathogenic viruses. Not all viruses that have been characterized are pathogenic, and in fact, only a minority of those that exist might be. However, since only a limited number of the viral genomes predicted by metagenomic surveys have been characterized, it is not possible to adventure a proportion of beneficial or neutral versus harmful viruses. In the course of investigations on poliomyelitis, a search for related viruses was undertaken, and a number of new viruses later to be known as echoviruses were discovered. They were isolated because they caused cytopathology to cells in culture. The virus-containing samples were from individuals that did not show symptoms of a viral infection. The new isolates were designated as \u201corphans,\u201d meaning viruses without the disease. The term echovirus derives from the enteric cytopathogenic human orphan virus. Some of them, or their close relatives, were later associated with disease syndromes, but others were not. Viruses, as diverse as circoviruses, polyomaviruses, or herpesviruses colonize a considerable proportion of animals, and only some of the virus types are the direct cause of disease [e.g., postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) by porcine circovirus type 2, or cancer by some polyomaviruses, among many other examples]. Disease potential is unrelated to viral genome size. PMWS is associated with the smallest mammalian DNA virus genome of only 1.7 Kb, while the almost 100-fold larger herpes virus genomes can coexist with immunocompetent humans without the noticeable disease.",

The more the knowledge of virus-host interactions, the border between the virus being pathogenic or nonpathogenic becomes fuzzier. Viruses may not damage essential cell functions but may affect dispensable cellular functions. Studies by M.B.A. Oldstone and his colleagues on persistent infections of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in neuroblastoma cells demonstrated that the resident virus altered the expression of differentiated cell trait while preserving vital functions (Oldstone et al., 1977). This is one of many examples of virus-induced modifications of the so-called luxury functions of cells (Oldstone, 1984). Disease manifestations depend on multiple host and viral factors (allelic forms of several genes, microbiome composition, immune status, coinfections with viruses or other agents, and so on). The dual infections with HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) during the end of the 20th century accelerated the evolution of HCV-associated liver disease.",

A reasonable hypothesis is that mechanisms similar to those observed in the present-day biosphere and virosphere were also in operation during the multiple transitions from a primitive replicon-based biosphere to a cellular world differentiated into different domains of life (Fig. 1.5\n). Although this point will again be examined as part of an overview in the closing chapter of the book (Chapter 10), here, some of the observations on the current biosphere dynamics that bear on the difficulties encountered in reconstructing the sequential transitions toward cellular differentiation are outlined. The following circumstances could have blurred the relationships among evolving previral and precellular entities and among viral genomes under construction, from the perspective of current genomics: (i) episodes of evolution at rates higher than average might historically have accelerated evolution and extinction of viral and cellular genetic elements. (ii) Experimental evolution has documented that viruses often have available multiple mutational pathways to gain fitness in changing environments. This could well apply to other genome assemblies at different stages of complexity. The genome assemblies and linkages we observe are a set among many others possible that could have existed for prolonged time periods but that are now extinct. A related aspect is that the acquisition of genomic modules from other cells or viral elements could render prior acquisitions obsolete or even detrimental. In consequence, an observed absence of shared genomic regions among different viral or cellular lineages from different life domains does not exclude that the shared domains had been transiently (transiently meaning million years!), with no trace in present-day viruses or cells. (iii) Bottleneck events could have erased biological organizations that had a similar degree of adaptation than others that survived. (iv) Fitness variation associated with genomic changes (due to mutation, recombination or lateral gene transfers) is environment-dependent, and the changes in the environment over millions of years might have been dramatic. Such changes might have affected a limited number of local environments or most environments globally. Furthermore, most of these potentially perturbing events might have taken place many times in unpredictable successions, affecting local and few or general and many environments, thus rendering reconstruction of past events from current genomics problematic (Domingo and Perales, 2019). Again, these contingencies will be more apparent when different facets of viral dynamics are dissected in the following chapters.",

It was, however, a necessary exercise, since at least part of what we see today in viruses must have roots in the origin of life and the role of viruses in life development during epochs that humans have not witnessed. We are left with trying to reconstruct. This chapter is excitingly as close to physics and chemistry as it is to biology. Many of the questions addressed are open to debate, and they will probably remain open for a long time. Interestingly, the terms \u201cheterogeneity\u201d and \u201ccomplexity\u201d have appeared several times in this chapter, anticipating features of present-day viruses discussed in the upcoming chapters. Complex populations, be they of viruses, cells, protocells, lipid vesicles, primitive replicons, or peptide soups, are the raw materials on which natural selection can act. Primitiveness does not imply simplicity. Complexity was likely a constant trait for early and modern life, both for the extinguished unknown viruses and for those we strive to understand and control (see Summary Box).\nSummary box\n\u2022Life is characterized by four integrated features: replication, evolvability, metabolism, and compartmentalization. It is debated whether replication or metabolism was the dominant triggering factor.\u2022At least two ancestral positive selection events might have contributed to the development of life: the selection of replicating over nonreplicating polymers, and selection of splitting-prone versus nonsplitting-prone membrane vesicles.\u2022Present-day viruses may be descendants from the primitive replicons that participated in early life prior to cellular organizations, or from structured cells by escape or reduction.\u2022Key features of many present-day viruses may be an inheritance of primitive replicons, notably error-prone replication, spread through membrane structures, and tendency to engage in genome integration and transfers.\u2022The geological record indicates multiple, brief, and drastic mass extinction events in Earth\u2019s history. Such events anticipate mass extinction of the resident viruses. A dynamics of emergences, reemergences, and extinctions might have operated historically at a grand-scale, with mechanisms similar to those we observe with present-day viruses. Present virosphere dynamics suggests difficulties to reconstruct events that spanned millions of years.\n\n",
