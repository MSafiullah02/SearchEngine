They then sequenced a 384well plate of clones using a universal primer. This yielded multiple reads, 6 of which were of sequences of a single virus. Further evaluation of these sequences demonstrated homology (albeit limited) to known polyomaviruses, with the closest relationship being to KI, a polyomavirus that had recently been recovered from respiratory tract samples from individuals with respiratory symptoms [1] . The newly discovered virus was designated WU, in keeping with the practice of naming polyomaviruses with 2-letter designations (e.g., KI, JC, and BK). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that WU and KI are divergent from other known polyomaviruses and define a novel branch within this family.",

In Brisbane, the samples yielding WU were obtained from individuals aged from 4 months to 53 years, although 33 of the 37 specimens were obtained from persons aged \u04403 years.

The very high frequency of detection of additional viruses, which were detected in almost three-fourths of the patients, complicates the analysis. Nonetheless, the frequency of its detection in individuals (especially young children with respiratory symptoms) in 2 geographically distinct areas highly suggests that it is a cause of human disease. In the meantime, we can expect the continued identification of additional novel viruses as candidate human respiratory pathogens and can add WU, along with the recently identified rhinovirus HRV-QPM [2] , to the list of viruses identified in respiratory tract specimens since 2001: human metapneumovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, human bocavirus, KI polyomavirus, and now HRV-QPM (rhinovirus) and WU polyomavirus.",

Although there was not a statistically significant difference in outcome, all 3 treatment failures occurred among the 14 patients who received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, for a treat-ment failure rate of 21%. The optimal antibiotic choice thus awaits results of future clinical trials with sample sizes sufficient to allow for definitive answers. One problem, however, is that community-acquired MRSA is a moving target, and that, in some geographical areas, it has acquired additional antibiotic-resistance determinants. An additional factor that must be considered in future trials is the potential benefit of effective antibiotic therapy on the prevention or delay of recurrences of infection.",

Urine specimens were obtained from 6632 participants (age, 14-39 years) during the period 1999-2002 in the National Health and Examination Survey; ligase chain reaction detected a prevalence of chlamydial infection of 2.2% (95% CI, 1.8%-2.8%) and a prevalence of gonorrheal infection of 0.24% (95% CI, 0.16%-0.38%). The prevalence of chlamydial infection was similar in male and female subjects but peaked at the ages of 14-19 years in female subjects and 14-29 years in male subjects. The prevalence was higher among non-Hispanic black sub-jects (6.4%) than among non-Hispanic white subjects (1.5%). The prevalence of gonorrheal infection was also higher in non-Hispanic blacks (1.2% vs. 0.07%). Forty-six percent of individuals with gonorrheal infection were coinfected with C. trachomatis. It should be noted that the test used in this survey targets a portion of a cryptic plasmid in C. trachomatis that has been lost by some isolates in Sweden, leading to false-negative results [1] . Although this is not likely to have affected the results of this study, it is an issue that may have to addressed in the future.The authors point out that these data support current recommendations for screening sexually active females aged \u044025 years for chlamydial infection and for coadministration of treatment for C. trachomatis infection in patients with gonorrheal infection, unless the former has been ruled out [2] . The following is a summary of current recommendations for screening [2] :\u2022 Screen for chlamydial infection in all sexually active, nonpregnant, young women (age, \u044024 years) and in older, nonpregnant women who are at increased risk.\u2022 Screen for chlamydial infection in all pregnant women aged \u044024 years and in older, pregnant women who are at increased risk.\u2022 Do not routinely screen for chlamydial infection in women aged \u044325 years, regardless of whether they are pregnant, if they are not at increased risk.\u2022 Current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for chlamydial infection in men.",
