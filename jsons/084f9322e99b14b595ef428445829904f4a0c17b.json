            "text": "Stroke often leads to arm disability and reduced responsiveness to stimuli on the other side of the body. Neurotrophin-3 (NT3) is made by skeletal muscle during infancy but levels drop postnatally and into adulthood. It is essential for the survival and wiring-up of sensory afferents from muscle. We have previously shown that gene therapy delivery of human NT3 into the affected triceps brachii forelimb muscle improves sensorimotor recovery after ischemic stroke in adult and elderly rats. Here, to move this therapy one step nearer to the clinic, we set out to test the hypothesis that intramuscular infusion of NT3 protein could improve sensorimotor recovery after ischemic cortical stroke in adult rats. To simulate a clinically-feasible time-to-treat, twenty-four hours later rats were randomized to receive NT3 or vehicle by infusion into triceps brachii for four weeks using implanted minipumps. NT3 increased the accuracy of forelimb placement during walking on a horizontal ladder and increased use of the affected arm for lateral support during rearing. NT3 also reversed sensory deficits on the affected forearm. There was no evidence of forepaw sensitivity to cold stimuli after stroke or NT3 treatment. MRI confirmed that treatment did not induce neuroprotection. Functional MRI during low threshold electrical stimulation of the affected forearm showed an increase in peri-infarct BOLD signal with time in both stroke groups and indicated that neurotrophin-3 did not further increase peri-infarct BOLD signal. Rather, NT3 induced spinal neuroplasticity including sprouting of the spared corticospinal and serotonergic pathways. Neurophysiology showed that NT3 treatment increased functional connectivity between the corticospinal tracts and spinal circuits controlling muscles on the treated side. After intravenous injection, radiolabelled NT3 crossed from bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord in adult mice with or without strokes. Our results show that delayed, peripheral infusion of neurotrophin-3 can improve sensorimotor function after ischemic stroke. Phase I and II clinical trials of NT3 (for constipation and neuropathy) have shown that peripheral, high doses are safe and well tolerated, which paves the way for NT3 as a therapy for stroke.",

Stroke victims also often exhibit lack of responsiveness to stimuli on their affected side. The W.H.O. estimates that, worldwide, there are 31 million stroke survivors, with another 9 million new strokes annually. The vast majority of stroke victims are not eligible for the few therapies that improve outcome because they arrive in hospital too late for reperfusion to be effective 2 . Treatment six hours or more after ischemic stroke is usually limited to rehabilitation: therapies that reverse sensory impairments and locomotor disability are urgently needed, and these must work when initiated many hours after stroke.",

However, peripheral levels of NT3 drop in the postnatal period 8 . We and others had shown that delivery of NT3 into the CNS promotes recovery in rodent models of spinal cord injury [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] but this involved invasive routes of delivery (e.g., intraspinal injection or intrathecal infusion) or gene therapy. We also recently showed that injection of an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) encoding full-length human NT3 (preproNT3, 30kDa) into forelimb muscles 24 hours after stroke in adult or elderly rats improved sensorimotor recovery 19 . We had originally expected that AAV1 would be trafficked from muscle to the spinal cord retrogradely in axons 20 and that this would enhance secretion of NT3 by motor neurons, leading to sprouting of the spared CST 11, 21, 22 and sensorimotor recovery. Although NT3 protein was overexpressed in injected muscles, to our surprise we found little evidence for expression of the human NT3 transgene in the spinal cord or cervical DRGs 17, 19 using this dose and preparation of AAV. This serendipitous result led us to reject our original assumption that sensorimotor recovery required expression of the human NT3 transgene in the spinal cord and to wonder whether peripheral infusion of NT3 protein would suffice.",

This is consistent with work by others 23 including a study showing that a signal from muscle spindles can improve neuroplasticity of descending pathways and can enhance recovery after CNS injury 24 . Notably, NT3 protein is synthesised by muscle spindles 25 and can be transported from muscle to sensory ganglia and spinal motor neurons in nerves 7, 17, 19 and from the bloodstream to the CNS [26] [27] [28] . This route of administration and time frame is clinically feasible so to take this potential therapy one step nearer the clinic, we next set out to determine whether intramuscular infusion of human NT3 protein (mature form, 14kDa) would improve outcome after stroke (i.e., bypassing the use of gene therapy and spinal surgery).",

In contrast to other neurotrophins, NT3 does not cause any serious adverse effects such as pain 34 probably because its principal high affinity receptor TrkC is not expressed on adult nociceptors 6, 35 . These studies pave the way for NT3 as a therapy for stroke in humans. We now show in a blinded, randomized preclinical trial that treatment of disabled upper arm muscles with human NT3 protein reverses sensory and motor disability in rats when treatment is initiated in a clinically-feasible timeframe (24 hours after stroke).",

Experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines from the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) and others and our findings were reported in accordance with the ARRIVE (Animals in Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments) guidelines. All surgical procedures, behavioural testing and analysis were performed using a randomised block design. All surgeries, behavioural testing and analysis were performed with investigators blinded to treatment groups. Rats were randomised to surgery by drawing a rat identity number from an envelope and then a stroke/sham allocation from an envelope. Allocation concealment was performed by having NT3 and vehicle stocks coded by an independent person prior to loading pumps. Behavioural testing was conducted blind and codes were only broken after behavioural analyses were complete. 65 Lister hooded (~4 months; 200-300 g) outbred female rats (Charles River, UK) and 95 adult C57Bl/6 mice (7-8 weeks) were used.

Focal ischemic stroke was induced in the hemisphere representing the dominant forelimb ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ), as determined by the cylinder behavioural test. Stroke lesions (n = 60) were performed as previously described 19 . Briefly, animals were transferred to a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments, USA) where a midline incision was made, the cortex was then exposed via craniotomy using the following co-ordinates [defined as anterioposterior (AP), mediolateral (ML)]: AP 4 mm to \u2212 2 mm, ML 2 mm to 4 mm, relative to bregma. Endothelin-1 (ET-1, 400 pmol/\u00b5L in sterile saline; CalBioChem) was applied using a glass micropipette attached to a Hamilton syringe. 1 \u00b5l of ET-1 to was applied to the overlying dura to reduce bleeding, and immediately thereafter, the dura mater was incised and reflected. Four 1 \u03bcl volumes of ET-1 were administered topically and four 1 \u00b5l volumes were microinjected intracortically (at a depth of 1 mm from the brain surface) at the following co-ordinates (from bregma and midline, respectively): AP + 3.5 mm, ML 2.8 mm AP + 2.0 mm, ML 2.8 mm AP + 0.5 mm, ML 2.8 mm AP -1.0 mm, ML 2.8 mm Temperature was maintained using a rectal probe connected to a homeothermic blanket (Harvard Apparatus, USA) placed under the animal which maintained rectal temperature at 36 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. Prior to suturing, the animal was left undisturbed for 5 minutes. Modifying previous work 36 , the skull fragment was then replaced and sealed using bone wax (Covidien, UK). 100% (60/60) of rats survived this stroke surgery. Sham-operated (n = 5) rats received all procedures up to, but not including, craniotomy or endothelin-1 injection. Animals were given buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg, subcutaneously) for postoperative pain relief.",

A bolus of 40 mg/kg alpha chloralose-Pestanal was injected intravenously and then the isoflurane was switched off after 5 minutes. An infusion line for continuous application of alpha chloralose was then attached to the cannula at 10 mg/kg/h over the experimental time. Medical air (0.8 L/min) and oxygen (0.2 L/min) was continuously delivered throughout the scanning period . MR images were obtained using a 7 Tesla scanner (Varian, Agilent). Initially, a T2-weighted structural scan was acquired, using a fast spin echo (FSE) sequence with repetition time (TR) = 4000 ms, echo time (TE) = 60 ms and field of view (FOV) of 40 x 40 mm, yielding 20 slices with voxel size of 0.3215 x 0.3125 x 1 mm in approximately 8 min. fMRI scans were acquired using a Multi-Gradient-Multi-Echo sequence (TR = 360 ms, TEs = 5, 10, 15 ms, voxel size 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm x 1 mm, resolution 64 x 64 x 20, scan time 23 s). 100 volumes were acquired with a pseudo-random onoff stimulation of the forepaw at 3 Hz (400 \u03bcs, 2 mA pulse) using a platinum subdermal needle electrode (F-E2, Grass Technologies, USA) and a TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) pad. It has previously been shown that the use of a TENS pad results in this intensity of stimulation being innocuous rather than noxious: whereas blood pressure is not altered at 2 mA stimulation, it is increased with 3.8 mA stimulation (see references in 19 ). The order of paw stimulation was also randomised. Animals were closely monitored following the end of the scanning, given 5 ml of saline (subcutaneous, room temperature) and were kept in a warmed incubator (31 deg C) until fully conscious: this takes 2 to 3 hours due to slow pharmacokinetics of alpha chloralose. Two animals died following alpha chloralose anaesthesia due to breathing difficulties in recovery. Scans with obvious imaging artefacts were discarded, leaving final group numbers of n=7, 9, 7 and n=9, 8, 4 at weeks 0, 1 and 8 for NT3 and vehicle treated groups respectively. The resulting images were analyzed with SPM-8 (Statistical Parametric Mapping, FIL, UCL). In order to make sure all lesions were in the same side of the brain, images with righthand side strokes were rotated about the sagittal mid-plane, so that the lesioned hemisphere always appeared on the left. Functional scans were initially realigned to the first image in the timeseries in order to correct for movements of the head. The first volume of the functional scan was then spatially registered to the structural image, which was, in turn, linearly warped to a template brain. Linear warping was used in this step in order to avoid deforming the lesion region. Warping parameters obtained during registration of structural image to template were applied to the realigned functional time-series, resulting in structural and functional images that are all in a standard space. Finally, functional images were smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with Full Width Half Maximum of 1.0 x 1.0 x 2 mm (twice the voxel size). Because of the relatively long effective TR of the functional images, a PET basic model (one-sample t-test) was used for firstlevel analyses with covariates consisting of the pseudo-random stimulation pattern (paradigm), and the estimated movement parameters of each individual rat. Volumes signal intensity was globally scaled and individual masks, generated from the fast spin echo (FSE) structural scan for each rat brain at each time-point using a 3D Pulse-Coupled Neural Network 40 (also registered to the template), were used as explicit masks for the first-level statistical analysis. Contrast images from the First-level analysis were then carried onto a Second-level (random effects) group analysis. Effects of group (i.e. NT3 or vehicle treated) and stimulated paw (i.e. affected or lessaffected) were used to create statistical comparisons. A flexible factorial analysis was used to compare the difference between the NT3 and vehicle treated groups in the change from baseline to 8 weeks 41 . Statistical parametric maps were generated using an uncorrected threshold of p < 0.05; images show group mean activations and T values are given.",

Allocation concealment was performed by having NT3 and vehicle stocks coded by a third party. Rats were anaesthetised as above and a small incision was made between elbow and axilla, and a small subcutaneous space was formed to the lower back. The osmotic pump with the catheter attached was positioned in this subcutaneous space and then an ultrafine, flexible catheter was implanted approximately 15 millimetres into the proximal end of the long head of the triceps brachii muscle on the disabled side and this was sutured in place (Prolene 5/0, Ethicon, UK). Triceps brachii was selected as the site for infusion because this large muscle is involved in forelimb extension during walking and for postural support during rearing) rearing. Note that in the triceps brachii, the end plates are located in the belly of the muscle 42 . The catheter was made from stretchable and flexible silicone tubing (ID = 0.012 inches, wall thickness = 0.007 inches, Trelleberg, SF Medical, UK, SFM1-1050) attached to the osmotic pump via larger gluedon tubing (ID 0.76 mm, VWR International). A second section of this stiff tubing (10 millimetres long) was inserted to guide the flexible catheter into the triceps; the guide was slid back after the silicone tube was implanted. Catheters were connected to subcutaneous osmotic minipumps (2ML2, Alzet) containing either vehicle (0.9% saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin; Sigma; A3059; 9048-46-8) or vehicle containing recombinant human NT3 (kind gift of Genentech Inc., USA). Pump flow moderators were MR-compatible (PEEK micro medical tubing, Durect, #0002511). The original vials contained 0.586 mg/ml recombinant human (\"rhu\") NT3 in 20 mM acetate, 140 mM NaCl, pH 5.0. SDS PAGE and proteomic analysis indicates that this is the 119 amino acid mature NT3 protein obtained after proteolytic cleavage of the 258 amino acid proneurotrophin-3 (Uniprot P20873) ( Supplementary Figures 7 and 8 ). The NT3 dose (12 \u00b5g/24 hours) was selected based on previous experiments 9 . Pumps were replaced after two weeks and removed after four weeks. Skin was sutured and analgesic administered as above. All rats survived this surgery. Sham rats did not undergo this surgery. Pilot experiments showed that the pump flow rate (5 \u00b5l/hour) was sufficient to deliver substances (0.9% saline containing 1% Fast Green, Sigma) to the entire volume of the triceps muscles.",

This is due to so-called \"matrix effects\" as shown by poor recovery of spiked-in NT3 (<80% or >120%) and non-linear relationship between concentration of input material and estimated NT3 concentration based on a dilution series of muscle homogenate. To overcome the effect of interfering substances, samples should be diluted and appropriate diluents to prepare standards and diluted samples must be used.

During exploration, rats rear against the vertical surface of the cylinder. The first forelimb to touch the wall was scored as an independent placement for that forelimb. Subsequent placement of the other forelimb against the wall to maintain balance was scored as \"both.\" If both forelimbs were simultaneously placed against the wall during rearing this was scored as \"both.\" A lateral movement along the wall using both forelimbs alternately was also scored as \"both.\" Scores were obtained from a total number of 10 full rears to control for differences in rearing between animals.

The reasons for taking a longer period of time to assess the evoked behaviour were to measure only pain-related behaviour evoked by cooling and not startle responses that can occur following the initial application of acetone 43 . Moreover, the behaviour evoked by acetone is often an interrupted series of behaviours, thus it is important to give enough time to see all pain-related behaviours. Responses to acetone were graded to the following 4-point scale: 0, no response; 1, quick withdrawal, flick or stamp of the paw; 2, prolonged withdrawal or repeated flicking of the paw; 3, repeated flicking of the paw with licking directed at the ventral side of the paw. Acetone was applied alternately three times to each paw and the responses scored categorically. Cumulative scores were then generated by adding the scores for each rat together, the minimum score being 0 (no response to any of the six trials) and the maximum possible score being 9 per forepaw.",

A Sensory Score was obtained by attaching pairs of adhesive patches to each rat's wrist on the dorsal side (Fig.  2a) : a high score (e.g. 6) denotes that a rat preferentially removed the smaller stimulus from their less-affected wrist (i.e., did not first remove the larger stimulus on their affected wrist). The two stroke groups exhibited a similar lack of responsiveness to stimuli on their affected wrists after one week (Fig. 2b) . Delayed treatment with NT3 caused recovery compared to vehicle: whereas vehicle-treated stroke rats showed a deficit relative to sham rats which persisted for eight weeks. Importantly, there were no confounding differences in the time taken to contact or to remove a patch from either their less-affected or affected paw: after stroke, NT3-treated rats and vehicletreated rats took longer to contact an adhesive patch relative to shams, but there was no difference between NT3 and vehicle treated rats (Supplementary Fig. 1a) . Moreover, neither stroke nor NT3 treatment caused any deficit in the additional time taken after contact to remove the patch (Supplementary Figure 1b) . Thus, delayed treatment of disabled forelimb muscles with NT3 improved responsiveness to tactile stimuli after ischemic stroke.",

NT3 treatment led to enhanced responses in the ulnar nerve during stimulation of the less-affected (Fig. 3 d, e) and more-affected (Fig. 3g, h) pathways. This result is consistent with the sprouting of traced CST axons (Fig. 3a,b) and indicates that CST axons from both the stroke hemisphere and the contralesional hemisphere formed new synapses and/or strengthened preexisting connections in the cord on the treated side, most likely on pre-motor interneurons that lie between CST axons and motoneurons 53, 54 . However, we did not find any evidence that NT3 strengthened the short-latency reflex from afferents in the median nerve to motor neurons in the ulnar nerve (Fig. 3i-l) . We also found that NT3 treatment caused serotonergic axons to sprout in the ventral C7 spinal cord (Fig. 4a-d) .

As expected, prior to stroke, stimulation of the wrist resulted in a higher probability of activation of the opposite somatosensory cortex (Supplementary Fig. 6a ). fMRI performed one week after stroke confirmed that somatosensory cortex was not active when the affected paw was stimulated in either vehicle or NT3 treated rats (p>0.05, Supplementary Fig. 6b ). This supports our claim above that there were no early differences between groups that could be explained by neuroprotection. fMRI performed eight weeks after stroke revealed a trend towards perilesional re-activation of somatosensory cortex in both vehicle and NT3 treated groups (p<0.05, Supplementary Fig. 6c ). This is in line with human brain imaging studies showing that spontaneous sensory recovery is increased after stroke when more-normal activity patterns are observed on the affected side of the brain 67 . However, these probabilities of re-activation were not big enough to survive correction for testing of multiple voxels (p-values>0.01) although clearly they are in a location that might mediate recovery of somatosensation.",

However, these apparent differences did not survive correction for testing of multiple voxels (p<0.01). We conclude that both groups showed partial, spontaneous restoration of more-normal patterns of somatosensory cortex activation 68,69 but, conservatively, that NT3 did not further increase probability of activation of any supraspinal areas.

There was no evidence of degradation or aggregation. Each band was excised separately, digested enzymatically (with trypsin) and subjected to LC/MS/MS analysis. Proteomic analysis was consistent with both bands being mature NT3 with no evidence of residual prepro sequences (Supplementary Figure 8) . We conclude that the higher molecular weight band is not preproNT3 (~30 kDa) but rather corresponds to dimeric mature NT3.

Secondly, there is good conservation from rodents to primates including humans in the expression of receptors for NT3 in the locomotor system 3, 4, [70] [71] [72] . Thirdly, in none of our rodent experiments has NT3 treatment caused any detectable pain, spasticity or muscle weakness (in line with the human trials); rather, after bilateral corticospinal tract injury in rats, intramuscular delivery of AAV-NT3 reduced spasticity, slightly improved grip strength and showed a trend towards reducing mechanical hyperalgesia 17 .",

We confirmed work by others that recovery correlated well with more-normal patterns of increased BOLD signal surrounding the infarct (potentially in spared somatosensory cortex) 68,69,73,74 but we did not find strong evidence that NT3 further increased peri-lesional (or other) activation (either in this study or in our previous study 19 ). Instead, we now propose that NT3 increased somatosensory recovery by inducing neuroplasticity in spinal circuits involving cutaneous afferents. This is plausible because cutaneous afferents which mediate tactile sensitivity express TrkC receptors 6 . Moreover, others have shown that dl3 spinal interneurons can gate cutaneous transmission 75 . We have previously shown that NT3 normalises post-activation depression of output from spinal circuits evoked by stimulation of low threshold afferents from the treated wrist 17 (which might include cutaneous afferents as well as proprioceptive afferents) although in those experiments we measured motor output rather than sensory transmission. In the future one might examine whether NT3 modulates gating of somatosensory inputs from the wrist to spinal interneurons 75 . However, in the present work, the deficits in somatosensory responses were modest and might be difficult to dissect.",

Others have shown that intrathecal infusion of NT3 induces sprouting of the corticospinal tracts 16 and that injection of vectors encoding NT3 into muscles 10 or nerve 11 can induce corticospinal tract sprouting. Here, our anatomical tracing confirmed that the less-affected corticospinal tract sprouted after infusion of NT3 protein into triceps and in future we will trace both tracts. This is because, in the present study, neurophysiology revealed that both corticospinal tracts underwent plasticity after unilateral infusion of NT3 protein. We propose that spared CST axons sprouted after NT3 entered the CNS from the systemic circulation. This is consistent with data from us and others showing that radiolabelled NT3 entered the brain and spinal cord after intravenous injection [26] [27] [28] . Moreover, it has been shown that endogenous muscle spindle-derived cues induce sprouting of descending pathways after spinal cord injury in adult mice 24 ; given that muscle spindles make NT3 endogenously 25 , it is plausible that infusion of supplementary NT3 to muscle might enhance corticospinal sprouting after stroke.",

Moreover, we did not find any evidence that NT3 strengthened the short-latency reflex between afferents in the median nerve and motor neurons in the ulnar nerve; this may be because we infused NT3 into the triceps brachii whose afferents do not run in the median or ulnar nerve. This is consistent with previous work of ours showing that a reflex may be strengthened when its afferent comes from a muscle expressing higher levels of NT3 but not when its afferent comes from a muscle lacking transgenic expression of NT3 17 . Finally, infusion of NT3 protein into triceps brachii did not improve forelimb grip strength: however, the grip strength task probably depends more on strength in hand and digit flexor muscles (into which NT3 was not infused) than on triceps brachii (elbow extensors). Indeed, in previous work, injection of AAV-NT3 into proximal and distal flexor muscles did modestly improve grip strength 17 . Taken together, these results indicate that it may be important to target NT3 to multiple muscles.",

It is possible that, additionally, NT3 was trafficked from triceps brachii in axons to motor neurons and/or by DRG neurons where it induced expression of a molecule that was secreted and induced CST sprouting (e.g., BDNF or IGF1 76,77 ). NT3 is certainly trafficked to ipsilateral motor neurons and DRG after intramuscular delivery 5, 7, 17, 19, 65 and in this study we also showed, unexpectedly, a small increase in contralateral triceps (perhaps from NT3 in endothelial cells). Diffusion of NT3 within neuropil is inefficient 78 but spinal motor neuron dendritic arbors can be very large; some even extend across the midline 79 and these might provide a widespread source of cues for supraspinal axonal plasticity (e.g., across the midline). To seek DRG-secreted factors, we have performed RNAseq of cervical DRG after injection of AAV-NT3 into forelimb flexors 17, 80 . In the future we will also seek motor neuron-derived cues.",

We propose that the four-week long NT3 treatment induces changes in target neurons that persist (e.g., due to sustained modifications in gene expression). Indeed, longer treatment with NT3 induces different intracellular signalling events in sensory axons than does brief treatment, thereby enhancing terminal branching 81 . In the future, we will seek factors that are persistently increased in target neurons after NT3 treatment is discontinued. Additionally, it may be that NT3 induces sprouting of CST axons that (after cessation of treatment) is followed by selection of synapses (e.g., strengthening or pruning) by a mechanism that is independent of NT3. For example, it is known that corticomotoneuronal axon synapses are pruned by repulsive PlexinA1-Sema6D interactions 82 .

The acetone test was used to see whether stroke and/or NT3 treatment caused any change in cold allodynia pain responses. The test involves applying a drop of acetone to the a) affected or b) less affected forelimb, and then allocating a score between 0 and 9: higher numbers denote a heightened pain response. There is no evidence of painful behaviour based on this test in either forelimb. RM ANCOVA with Bonferroni post hoc tests. Figure 5 : ELISA revealed that infusion of NT3 into triceps brachii did not cause detectable elevation of NT3 in homogenates of cervical spinal cord hemicords on the infused or non-infused side of the body (Mann Whitney p-values=0.84, 0.42, respectively). Figure 6 : Functional brain imaging during stimulation of the affected wrist revealed no enhanced probability of perilesional activation by neurotrophin-3. The same rats were imaged prior to stroke and then one week and eight weeks after stroke and intramuscular treatment with either NT3 or vehicle. Scans with obvious imaging artefacts were discarded, leaving final group numbers of n=7, 9, 7 and n=9, 8, 4 at weeks 0, 1 and 8 for NT3 and vehicle treated groups respectively. Red voxels denote greater probability of activation during stimulation (versus stimulation off) whereas blue voxels denote lesser probability of activation during stimulation (versus stimulation off). a) Prior to stroke, stimulation of the dominant paw led to a strong probability of activation in the opposite somatosensory cortex. b) One week after stroke, this activation was abolished by infarction. c) Eight weeks after stroke, there was a slight trend towards a small perilesional area of reactivation in both groups. d) There was a slight trend towards greater perilesional reactivation in the NT3 group versus the vehicle group at 8 weeks (relative to their baselines). However, all these heat maps of groups of rats show t-values obtained by Statistical Parametric Map analysis without correction for multiple testing (p<0.05) and there were no differences between the two groups for any voxels when the threshold for significance was corrected for multiple testing (p<0.01; this data is not shown as the heat map was black). Red voxels denote greater probability of activation during stimulation for the NT3 group than for the vehicle group whereas blue voxels denote lesser probability of activation for the NT3 group than for the vehicle group. When stimulating the less-affected wrist, there were no differences between the two groups for any voxels when the threshold for significance was corrected for multiple testing (p<0.01; this data is not shown as the heat map was black). Figure 7 : Different amounts of recombinant NT3 were run in four lanes of an SDS PAGE gel. Two sizes of band of interest (LM1_1 and LM1_2) were detected following staining with Colloidal Coomassie brilliant blue. These protein bands were excised prior to separate enzymatic digestion and LC/MS/MS analysis. The apparent molecular weight of the upper band (~30kDa) is consistent with either the pro-Neurotrophin-3 precursor form or a dimer of the mature NT3 protein, whilst the lower band (~14kDa) is consistent with the mature NT3 protein. Sequencing revealed that both bands represent the mature NT3 protein.",
