            "text": "The classical renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) pathway regulating the cardiovascular system primarily through the hormone angiotensin II (Ang II) has evolved over a period of some 60 years into a complex network of angiotensin mediators and receptors influencing multiple physiological pathways at both intracellular and endocrine levels. In the simplified linear pathway from precursor protein (angiotensinogen) to the vasoconstrictor octapeptide, Ang II, two key proteolytic enzymes are involved: the aspartic protease renin cleaving the decapeptide Ang I from angiotensinogen and the metallopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converting Ang I to Ang II. Both of these proteases have served as primary targets for the development of antihypertensive drugs: for example, aliskiren for renin and captopril and its many successors for ACE. ACE also inactivates the vasodilator bradykinin, providing an intricate dual regulation of blood pressure. The discovery of Ang-(1-7) as a functional angiotensin mediator,1 subsequently shown to counterbalance the action of Ang II,2 set the scene for the hunt for the Ang-(1-7)-forming enzyme(s) and its cognate peptide receptor (Mas receptor3). Not until both of these entities were identified did the physiological significance of Ang-(1-7) become widely accepted.",

            "text": "ACE is a highly glycosylated, transmembrane protein existing in two differentially spliced forms: the two-domain somatic ACE (N- and C-domains) with similar but not identical substrate specificities, which is important for cardiovascular regulation, and the single-domain testicular form important for male fertility through metabolism of an unidentified peptide substrate. Somatic ACE also plays important roles in developmental processes, inflammation and immunity, and neurodegenerative disease (reviewed in Ref. [4]). For almost 50 years from the discovery of ACE, the existence of a human \u201cACE2\u201d remained undiscovered and unpredicted notwithstanding the importance of ACE inhibitors to pharmacology and therapeutics, despite the known existence of ACE homologues in invertebrate species. For example, Drosophila expresses two ACE-like genes and catalytically active protein products (Ance and Acer) important in insect development and physiology.5 It was on this basis that a search of human expressed sequence tags led us to identify, clone, and characterize a human ACE homologue, designated ACE2.6 Shortly afterward and quite independently, Donoghue and colleagues identified the ACE2 gene as one upregulated in a human heart failure cDNA library.7 Despite the high sequence similarities between ACE and ACE2, there were some surprising differences in substrate specificity in that ACE2 functions exclusively as a carboxypeptidase removing a single C-terminal amino acid from Ang II generating Ang-(1-7) or, much less efficiently, from Ang I forming Ang-(1-9). In contrast, ACE principally acts as a carboxydipeptidase (peptidyldipeptidase) removing the C-terminal dipeptide from Ang I to form Ang II. ACE2 activity is also not affected by classical ACE inhibitors. Detailed structural and mutagenesis studies have revealed the important features leading to these specificity differences between ACE and ACE2.8\n,\n9 It is these synergies in angiotensin metabolism, with ACE forming Ang II and ACE2 removing it by conversion to Ang-(1-7), that provides the counterbalancing of angiotensin metabolism by these two homologous enzymes providing metabolites that act through three distinct receptors, AT1, AT2, and Mas. ACE2, however, is not the only metabolic route to Ang-(1-7), which can also be formed directly from Ang I by neprilysin (NEP), and other peptidases (prolyl endopeptidase and thimet oligopeptidase) may also participate in Ang-(1-7) biosynthesis depending on tissue or cell type. However, kinetic analysis indicates that the most efficient pathway for Ang-(1-7) generation is directly from Ang II via ACE2.10 A unique metallopeptidase may function to inactivate Ang-(1-7) to Ang-(1-4), at least in the brain.11\n",

Unlike ACE, ACE2 degrades [des-Arg9]-bradykinin but not bradykinin itself.6 Since [des-Arg9]-bradykinin is the ligand for the B1 bradykinin receptor, ACE2 may function to turn off signaling at this receptor. Other substrates for ACE2, at least in vitro, include apelin-13/17, neurotensin (1-11), dynorphin A (1-13), and ghrelin.12 There appears to be a close interplay between the inotropic and cardioprotective peptides apelin and ACE2 since ACE2 is downregulated in apelin-deficient mice and apelin acts as a positive regulator of ACE2 expression in failing hearts in vivo.\n13 The recent discovery of a new player in the RAS, alamandine, has shown that this peptide can be formed from angiotensin A by ACE2 action and acts through a Mas-related gene receptor (MrgD).14 Angiotensin A is itself formed by decarboxylation of the N-terminal aspartyl residue of Ang II to an alanyl residue.15\n",

            "text": "Roles for both ACE and ACE2 are emerging in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), specifically the ability of both enzymes to hydrolyze the amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide. ACE can cleave A\u03b240 at internal sites in the peptide reducing its aggregation.16 It can also hydrolyze the more hydrophobic A\u03b2-(1-42) to the less neurotoxic form (A\u03b240) with ACE inhibition enhancing A\u03b2 deposition.17 The larger A\u03b243 species is also found in AD brain and A\u03b243 is the earliest-depositing A\u03b2 species in APP transgenic mouse brain.18 We have now demonstrated19 that ACE2 can efficiently hydrolyze A\u03b243 to A\u03b242 that is then further degraded to A\u03b240 by ACE. The discovery that NEP was a major A\u03b2-degrading enzyme in vivo led to a cessation of developments of NEP inhibitors as novel antihypertensives because of the potential for promoting the onset of AD through enhanced A\u03b2 accumulation and aggregation. This, then, begs the question as to whether ACE inhibitors, by promoting the accumulation of more toxic A\u03b2 species in the brain, might also predispose to AD. To date, there are no epidemiological data to support this concept, and ACE inhibition with captopril even retards the development of signs of neurodegeneration in an animal model of AD.20 This is most likely explained by the greater protective vascular effects on the brain of ACE inhibition, AD itself having a major vascular component in its etiology. Furthermore, ACE overexpression in myelomonocytes prevents Alzheimer\u2019s-like cognitive decline.21 A comparison of the substrate specificities of ACE and ACE2 is provided in Table 1\n.",

Likewise, ACE2 regulates transport of intestinal neutral amino acid transporters of the B0AT1 family to the plasma membrane and has been implicated in the pathology of Hartnup\u2019s disease, a disorder of amino acid homeostasis.22 Through this process, ACE2 also appears to regulate intestinal inflammation and diarrhea, hence modulating the gut microbiome.23 Other disease processes in which ACE2 is involved are infection and pathology induced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus through its serendipitous function as the cell-surface receptor for the virus facilitating viral RNA entry in the lungs.24 The consequent downregulation of surface ACE2 levels leads to increased local levels of Ang II, which probably contribute to the significant mortality rates resulting from the acute lung injury and fibrosis caused by SARS.25\n,\n26 ACE2 may also be protective against liver fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases,27 again through reduction in Ang II levels (or elevated Ang-(1-7) levels).",

[29]). The generally cardioprotective role of ACE2 has limited the development of ACE2 inhibitors since they are unlikely to be of therapeutic benefit in cardiovascular or other disease states where, instead, upregulation of ACE2 expression or activity is required. Nevertheless, given the knowledge of ACE2 structure, mechanism, and specificity, a number of ACE2 selective inhibitors of nM potency have been developed including MLN-4760 (GL1001), DX-600, and 416F2 (see Ref. [30] for a review). More interesting from a therapeutic perspective has been the rational development of ACE2 activator small molecules that lower blood pressure in animal models.31 A structurally related antitrypanosomal drug (diminazene aceturate) also activates ACE232 and exhibits beneficial cardiovascular activity.33 However, the biological effects of these compounds in vivo may be ACE2-independent so some caution is needed in the interpretation of these data at present.34\n",
