            "text": "The intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual assault (SA) workforce faces significant occupational stressors yet little is known about positive occupational outcomes associated with this work. Therefore, this study analyzed factors associated with compassion satisfaction among the IPV/SA workforce in one southwestern U.S. state (n = 623). Drawing from the Resilience Portfolio Model (Grych et al. 2015) , researchers examined the possible role of coping behaviors in mediating associations between compassion satisfaction and workplace resources / assets, perceived job security, and resilience. Analyses revealed partial mediation in the models that included workload, values, and resilience as independent variables, suggesting that these factors both influence workers' coping behaviors and have an independent association with compassion satisfaction. Models investigating control, rewards, community, fairness, and perceived job security indicated significant total effects of the independent variables on compassion satisfaction. Overall, IPV/SA workers who engaged more frequently in a range of coping behaviors reported higher levels of compassion satisfaction. The findings point to implications for organizational and employee practice, including building in worktime for key individual coping behaviors, balancing workloads among staff members, and enhancing organizational level coping strategies, such as team supervision and team care planning.",

            "text": "A growing body of research is concerned with the occupational stress and secondary trauma experiences of the intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual assault (SA) workforce (Babin et al. 2012; Baird and Jenkins 2003; Bemiller and Williams 2011; Dworkin et al. 2016; Kulkarni et al. 2013; Slattery and Goodman 2009; The Texas Council on Family Violence, 2016 ). Yet gaps in knowledge remain about what fosters and sustains the well-being and tenure of the IPV/SA workforce over time. Research efforts have highlighted stressful work environments, resource constraints, and high employee turnover in this social service sector (Merchant and Whiting 2015; Mor Barak et al. 2001) . The IPV/SA workforce is also among the most at-risk professionals for burnout and secondary traumatic stress (STS) (Baird and Jenkins 2003; Busch-Armendariz et al. 2010; Slattery and Goodman 2009; Ullman and Townsend 2007; Wies 2008 ). Occupational conditions such low pay, lack of organizational support, and a hostile work environment can reduce job satisfaction and increase turnover intention, leading to retention concerns (Wood et al. 2019) . Nevertheless, recent studies highlight strong levels of commitment, mission attachment, and capacity to navigate crises, which may serve to keep IPV/SA workers in occupational roles despite challenging conditions (Wood et al. 2017; Bemiller and Williams 2011; Frey et al. 2017) . In an effort to contribute to the scant evidence-base concerned with the positive outcomes of this critical work, this study examined factors associated with compassion satisfaction and the mediating role of coping behaviors among IPV/SA workers.",

            "text": "The Well-Being of the IPV/SA Workforce Occupational Stress The IPV/SAworkforce is at particular risk for negative workplace experiences due to the trauma-and crisis-oriented nature of the work (Wood et al. 2017; Babin et al. 2012; Baird and Jenkins 2003; Dworkin et al. 2016; Kulkarni et al. 2012; Slattery & Goodman, Ullman and Townsend 2007) . Occupational stress can include compassion fatigue, which comprises employee burnout and STS (Stamm 2005) . Burnout involves feelings of depersonalization, exhaustion, and difficulties doing one's job effectively, and is often associated with a very high workload or a nonsupportive work environment (Stamm 2005) . STS describes the occupational exposure to the trauma of clients and may involve difficulties sleeping, intrusive thoughts, or avoiding reminders of client experiences (Stamm 2005) . Major factors linked to STS and burnout include lack of self-care, uncontrolled work stressors, unresolved trauma, and lack of job satisfaction (Radey and Figley 2007) . Organizational factors including resource constraints, racism, bias, lack of control, high caseloads, and low quality of supervision are associated with higher levels of STS and burnout; individual factors such as age, time in the field, and insufficient leisure activities are also related (Wood et al. 2019; Dworkin et al. 2016; Kulkarni et al. 2013; Slattery and Goodman 2009; Ullman and Townsend 2007) . Many workers in the IPV/SA field of work have themselves experienced violence or trauma (Wood 2016; Kulkarni et al. 2012; Slattery and Goodman 2009 ). As such, many workers bring experiences of survivorship to the work, which can be protective and predictive of occupational stress (Dworkin et al. 2016; Slattery and Goodman 2009; Frey et al. 2017) .",

A less researched aspect of professional life is the pleasure workers derive from being able to do their jobs well, conceptualized as compassion satisfaction (Stamm 2010) . Compassion satisfaction informs the occupational stress paradigm by emphasizing the benefits that can come from particularly taxing work. Compassion satisfaction has conceptual roots in positive psychology, acknowledges the potential benefit of working with traumatized populations (Kulkarni et al. 2013 ) and involves personal affect, resources, and self-care (Radey and Figley 2007) . The construct of compassion satisfaction shares conceptual overlap with other positive outcomes research among the IPV/SA workforce, such as vicarious posttraumatic growth and resilience (Frey et al. 2017) . As an occupational outcome, compassion satisfaction is associated with resilience (Frey et al. 2017) , increased job satisfaction (Wood et al. 2017) , and mitigating STS-related anxiety (Samios et al. 2013) . Compassion satisfaction is also associated with lower burnout and STS among victim advocates (Cummings et al. 2018 ) and mental health workers (Ray et al. 2013) . Compassion satisfaction can co-occur with burnout and secondary traumatic stress (Conrad and Kellar-Guenther 2006) . Compassion satisfaction is associated with increased time in the field, higher levels of empathy, positive emotions, greater feelings of control at work, and value alignment (Killian 2008; Kulkarni et al. 2013; Samios et al. 2013; Wagaman et al. 2015) . Harr (2013) asserts that supportive administration, supervision, team mentality, and agency environments are integral to increasing compassion satisfaction.",

Resilience is a key factor in positive outcomes associated with social service work. Resilience encapsulates a dynamic process of positive adaptation and healthy functioning following significant adversity, stress, and/or traumatic life events (Luthar et al. 2000; Masten 2011) . Individual, interpersonal, and community factors, such as self-regulation, secure attachment, and collective efficacy, are associated with healthy functioning and adaptive outcomes (Luthar et al. 2000; Masten 2007 in Grych et al. 2015 . Rather than being a fixed personality trait, dynamic circumstances, stressors, risks, and protective factors interact to shape resilience (Collins 2007; Masten 2011) . In the workplace, resilience helps workers to respond effectively to the challenge of occupational stress, and is therefore especially pertinent to social service providers (Grant and Kinman 2012; Collins 2008; Howe 2008) . Resilience relates to personal and professional growth, and involves self-care, inner strength, values, motivation, self-advocacy, and energy (Fink-Samnick 2009).",

            "text": "Coping Positive coping behaviors relate to positive occupational outcomes. Closely related to resilience, coping refers to people's ongoing efforts to meet external and internal stressors perceived as challenging or exceeding their resources (Lazarus 2013) . In their theory of stress and coping, Lazarus and Folkman (1984) posited that the relationship between person and environment determines an individual's ability to cope, and efforts to cope may also involve signaling to potential support providers a need for support. Positive coping may involve cognitive restructuring to manage the symptoms of distress in contrast to directly addressing the stressor (Collins 2008) . Although many coping models exist (Grych et al. 2015) , the research on occupational coping is still nascent. Research suggests positive coping behaviors promote personal wellness, mitigate occupational stress, and increase compassion satisfaction (Cummings et al. 2018; Ray et al. 2013; Stamm 2005) . Not all coping strategies are inherently positive (e.g., drinking to excess, avoidance, and under-or over-eating). An earlier study by Um and Harrison (1998) showed an association between coping strategies employed by clinical social workers and job satisfaction. surveyed 259 helping professionals on their use of coping behaviors, and although most participants in their study believed leisure activities and self-care were useful, they were not associated with decreased traumatic stress scores. Qualitative research adds nuance to understanding coping in IPV/SA professional settings. In a study with rape victim advocates, participants felt informal support in the workplace nurtured their well-being and work; however, fear of burdening their peers and a lack of preparedness inhibited access to sufficient support (Houston-Kolnik et al. 2017 ).",

The model builds on research involving resilience, positive psychology, posttraumatic growth, and coping, and highlights what people do in the face of stress that promotes well-being rather than describing qualities that they possess. The model posits that well-being post-violence exposure is the result of Bthe characteristics of the adversity, the assets and responses available to them, and their behavior or responses^ (Grych et al. 2015, p. 3). The model suggests direct associations between (a) exposure to violence, (b) resources/ assets, (c) appraisals and coping behavior, and (d) psychological health, as well as a number of moderating and mediating pathways. Resources refer to external sources of support (i.e. supportive relationships and environmental factors) and assets relate to the person's characteristics that promote healthy functioning (i.e. regulatory, interpersonal and meaning-making strengths) (Grych et al. 2015, p. 4 ). Together, resources and assets comprise an individual's Bportfolio^of strengths and protection factors (p. 4). Appraisals and coping behavior refer to the meanings people make of violence and adverse events, as well as their responses. The RPM model proposes a main effects relationship between resources/ assets and healthy functioning, as well as a buffering effect between resources/assets and well-being in times of stress. Psychological health relates to a broad definition of well-being and positive affect.",

We set out to examine associations between RPM constructs of resources/assets, appraisals and coping behavior, and psychological health, which for the purposes of our analysis we conceptualized as workplace resources and workforce assets, occupational coping behaviors, and workforce well-being. As a secondary analysis, we drew variables from a broader dataset as proxy measures for relevant constructs, highlighted in Table 1 and detailed below in the subsequent section. In brief, for workplace resources, we utilized measures of perceived job security and goodness of fit between individuals and their professional environments, and for workforce assets, we employed a resilience measure. For coping behaviors, we used a coping measure modified for the IPV/SA workforce. As our main outcome of interest, we utilized a measure of compassion satisfaction to reflect the construct of workforce well-being. As previously indicated, exposure to violence is a key factor in the RPM, which we conceptualized as secondary traumatic stress in relation to our sample but did not include in the current analysis.",

The findings demonstrate that IPV/SA workers who engaged more frequently in a range of coping behaviors reported higher levels of compassion satisfaction. In addition, the findings reveal a nuanced interplay of occupational resources, assets, coping behaviors, and well-being. In support of our hypothesis, the mediation models found significant direct and indirect effects of workload, values, and resilience on compassion satisfaction through coping behaviors, indicating a partially mediating role of coping behaviors in these models. In contrast, our analysis showed statistically insignificant direct effects for compassion satisfaction in the models involving measures of control, rewards, community, fairness, and perceived job security. These models demonstrated effects of occupational factors on compassion satisfaction that were fully mediated by the frequency of coping behaviors. Overall, the findings support the adaptation of the RPM to the IPV/SA occupational context and points to implications for organizational policy and practice. The analysis reiterates the importance of considering staff well-being among workers at high risk of occupational stress, burnout, and STS. While compassion satisfaction is only one example of positive outcomes associated with stressful work, the construct is significant because it encompasses aspects of the work experience often left out in the daily running of service agencies. Compassion satisfaction speaks to the satisfaction one gets from one's job and from helping other people. It encompasses feelings of invigoration and happiness, a sense of being able to adapt to changes, and the desire to continue because workers feel they can make a difference in people's lives (Stamm 2010, p. 21) . As evidenced by previous research, compassion satisfaction is instrumental in staff retention over time, increased empathy, and positive emotions in general (Killian 2008; Kulkarni et al. 2013; Samios et al. 2013; Wagaman et al. 2015) . As an important component of worker well-being, compassion satisfaction may thus contribute to improving the functioning of IPV/SA agencies and the quality of services available for violence survivors (Cummings et al. 2018) . Adding to the extant literature, our analysis indicates that employers can foster compassion satisfaction by providing workers opportunities to assert control over their work environment, giving meaningful rewards, and building a sense of community and fairness. In addition, addressing imbalanced or extreme workloads, establishing fit between practitioner and agency values, and identifying resilience as an important trait for staff during the hiring process (possibly over certain academic credentials, for example) can all contribute to staff experiencing greater compassion satisfaction. Efforts to cultivate resilience among the workforce are also essential and an important area for intervention research.",

Study respondents reported using a range of coping behaviors to manage the stressful nature of their work. Importantly, behaviors occurring outside the workplace and on their staff members' own time were most frequently endorsed; time with family, watching movies and television, engaging in hobbies, and taking vacation and time-off were all frequently endorsed by respondents. In contrast, the least frequently endorsed strategies involved work-place supervision related to trauma, teambased stress management training, developing team care plans, and engaging on an individual basis in stress management training. These findings may reflect the infrequency with which employers offer their workers opportunities to engage in these explicit types of stress reduction activities onsite and during work hours; and point to the degree to which agencies might place the onus for managing stress on workers, and expect workers to devise strategies for coping with stressful work outside of the workplace. In this case, providing work time for these activities, and accommodating staff workloads accordingly, could be an important step by IPV/SA service agencies on the path towards increased worker well-being. However, these findings might alternately reflect how employees perceive and value those types of opportunities. For instance, staff may feel that attending more meetings means less time for work and more stress. Understanding these nuances, using qualitative approaches, would be an important step forward in building the knowledge base.",

Together, the findings point to the importance of organizations in promoting holistic approaches that take into account multiple aspects of worklife to promote well-being, and suggest the importance of fostering regular use of coping behaviors among workers in both personal and professional spheres of life. For organizations, ensuring staff have the time, space, and resources to make full use of coping behaviors is good practice on all levels, as it will pay off in better client services, enhanced worker well-being, and ultimately a more stable workforce, which may help offset many of the costs of taking such steps in the first place.",

Conceptualizations of self-care strategies typically include activities such as seeking supervision, working within teams, attending trauma-specific training, balancing caseloads, practicing stress management techniques, developing a plan for work-life balance, and seeking counseling for issues sparked or exacerbated by work (Salloum et al. 2015) .

The demographics and experiences of participants therefore reflect, to a degree, the workforce of a particular geographic context. Other structural considerationssuch as levels of funding, inter-agency coordination, and state policyare also specific to the state in which the study took place. Second, the cross-sectional dataset restricts our ability to draw conclusions as to the direction of associations tested in this analysis, and sparks additional questions about the role compassion satisfaction may play in influencing workers' perspectives and experiences of the workplace.

It points to the importance of occupational resources, assets, coping behaviors, and individual factors in influencing worker well-being, and suggests that IPV/ SA agencies, supervisors, and employees all have important roles to play in promoting worker well-being.",
