J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 5 It is not known how underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) contributes to the severity of COVID-19 disease. Does comorbid CVD increase the likelihood of developing severe disease and/or increase the risk of myocardial injury? Lessons from SARS and MERS are unclear with regard to the impact of CVD on disease severity. A meta-analysis of 637 cases of MERS identified the prevalence of CVD, hypertension, and diabetes to be 30%, 50%, and 50% respectively [18] . Authors suggest that metabolic syndrome-related conditions, such as CVD, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 elevation was 13.3%, compared to 7.6% for individuals without CVD or TnT elevations on admission. Importantly, individuals with CVD were significantly more likely to experience elevated TnT on admission compared to patients without underlying disease, indicating an increased susceptibility to cardiac tissue insult due to underlying chronic disease.",

One mechanism, direct myocardial injury, will be addressed subsequently in this review. Other proposed mechanisms include: 1) Ineffective adaptation of the cardiovascular system to the increased demand of severe viral illness, coupled with decreased systemic oxygenation during pneumonia [23, 24, 25] . 2) Immune dysregulation, including T cell and immune signaling dysfunction, recognized as an important factor in the pathogenesis of vascular disease, may also adversely affect the body's response to SARS-CoV-2 infection [26, 27, 28, 29] . 3) Electrolyte imbalances and adverse medication effects may disproportionately challenge a diseased heart, with special consideration for the regimen of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin treatment due to the potential for QTc prolongation [5, 30] . Future studies are needed to elucidate these mechanisms and continue to identify targeted interventions for patients with underlying CVD.",

They further noted that age, male sex, elevated serum creatinine, hypertension, and coronary heart disease are additional factors contributing to severity of disease [31] . In one of the initial studies in Wuhan, Huang et al, reported increased high sensitive troponin I (hs-cTnI) levels (>28 pg/ml) in 5 of 41 COVID-19 patients. In their study 4 out of 5 patients with elevated hs-cTnI required ICU admission [32] . In a similar single-center case series of 138 patients, 36 patients required ICU admission and their levels of creatine kinase (CK)-MB and hs-cTnI were significantly higher [33] . Similarly, in a retrospective Chinese case series study on 187 patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19, nearly 27% demonstrated increased TnT levels consistent with myocardial injury. As mentioned previously in Comorbid Cardiovascular Disease and Illness Course, this study demonstrated that in patients with underlying CVD increased TnT levels were associated with higher mortality compared with no CVD. However, even in patients without underlying CVD, elevated troponin was associated with higher mortality. Furthermore, they noted that frequency of arrhythmias was higher in patients with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 elevated TnT. Finally they reported that in patients who died from the virus, levels of TnT and NT-proBNP increased during the course of hospitalization [22] . In a similar study in Wuhan a total of 82 out of 416 hospitalized patients showed myocardial injury via the same surrogate markers and the mortality rate was higher in this group of patients even after adjustment for age and other comorbidities [34] . In another case-series of 419 cases with COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China, patients were divided into 36 ICU patients and 383 non-ICU patients. They reported that hs-cTnI level was significantly higher in the ICU group. Patients with elevated enzymes or cardiac symptoms underwent echocardiography demonstrating thickened interventricular septum in 11 (31%) patients with associated enlarged left ventricular diastolic diameter, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, and increased pulmonary arterial pressure in 4 (11%) patients [35] .",

Given the clinical data, the group suspected that the course of death in some of these patients was due to fulminant myocarditis. More formal studies on the incidence of myocarditis have since been published as well. In a multicentered study of 84 patients, 13 (15.48%) were noted to have abnormal ECGs and cardiac enzyme levels, however only 4 (4.8%) were clinically diagnosed with myocarditis. The incidence of myocarditis in this study is lower than most other reports most likely due to confirmation of the diagnosis based on the clinical criteria for myocarditis mentioned previously [41] . Finally, in a case series by Chen et al. they reported increased levels of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide and cTnI in 27.5% and 10 % of patients respectively. Interestingly, levels of IL-6 and other inflammatory cytokines were noted to be elevated especially in patients who experienced a more severe disease course requiring ICU admission. The group hypothesized that the elevated cytokines were due to cytokine storm, which they attributed as the cause of Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f mechanisms that may result in myocardial injury secondary to infection with SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying myocardial injury caused by COVID-19 are not well known so far and more studies need to be done to further delineate the mechanisms. As discussed previously, human SARS-CoV infection of the myocardium is known to be dependent on ACE-2 receptors. Disruption of ACE-2 leads to an age-dependent cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysfunction, and heart failure [42, 43] . Oudit et. al, hypothesized that the interaction between SARS-CoV and ACE-2 in the heart could contribute to SARS-mediated myocardial inflammation and damage. They reported that the SARS-CoV viral RNA was detected in autopsied human heart samples suggesting direct myocyte invasion of the virus. They further indicated marked down regulation of ACE-2 and reductions in ACE-2 protein in the heart samples. Moreover, they reported significant myocardial macrophage infiltration of post-mortem heart samples [13] . The detrimental effect of ACE-2 downregulation would impede cardioprotective effects of angiotensin 1-7 leading to increased TNF\u03b1 production [42, 44] . TNF\u03b1 is a common inflammatory cytokine and many researchers have shown that the inflammatory response may be at least partially responsible for the myocardial damage. For example, Guo et al, reported increased inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein, along with elevated TnT levels in patients with underlying CVD and poor outcomes, supporting the idea of severe inflammatory response as a possible mediator of cardiomyocyte damage [22] .",

Given the level of global interconnectivity, some epidemiologists have forecasted that 40-70% of the world's population will be infected with COVID-19 in the coming year [49] . If this is true, it means 40-70% of the population will experience anything from no symptoms at all, to mild respiratory symptoms, to severe and lifethreatening respiratory symptoms. For the infected population, it appears underlying cardiovascular disease is related to worsening outcomes in patients who have COVID-19. In one study the case mortality rate more than tripled for patients with underlying cardiovascular disease [19]. This is not necessarily unique to coronavirus as many infections are made worse by underlying cardiac disease. However, it was also noted that patients with a history of cardiovascular disease were more likely to have elevated levels of cardiac enzymes such as TnT J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 12 which suggests the possibility that these patients were more susceptible to cardiac injury via SARS-2-CoV [22] .

Several reports have already investigated the incidence of myocarditis in COVID-19 patients and some have reported circulatory failure resulting from myocardial damage secondary to the viral disease as the cause of death [36] . Interestingly, emerging case reports are also showing that patients are presenting without respiratory symptoms and instead with chest pain, pressure, fatigue, etc. and later being found to be COVID-19 positive with myocarditis. The mechanisms leading to cardiac damage are numerous and include direct insult to myocytes by the virus, cytokine and interferon inflammatory responses, myocardial interstitial fibrotic response, T1 and T2 helper cell response [45, 46, 47, 48] . What is known about the SARS-CoV subfamily in general is that they enter cells Several key points have been gleaned through this review of myocardial injury as it relates to Covid-19. First, it appears that this strain of SARS-CoV has an increased propensity for developing extra-pulmonary complications, namely myocardial involvement. The reporting of myocardial involvement is likely still very low given the current focus on the more common respiratory symptoms. Second, it shows that while cardiac involvement is often self-limiting, some studies have reported myocardial injury as being the cause of death and thus it is important that clinicians have this complication on their radar [36] . Third, some case reports have accounts of patients who presented without respiratory symptoms and were later found to be COVIDpositive after being diagnosed with myocarditis. With the emphasis of respiratory involvement of the COVID-19 syndrome, it is important to keep a high index of suspicion for the disease in patients presenting atypically to ensure we minimize community and healthcare worker exposure. Finally, our review found that there are many proposed mechanisms of myocardial damage secondary to COVID-19 infection, but more research is required to delineate whether the virus causes direct myocardial injury, inflammatory mediated injury, or injury through another mechanism.",

Since the Ruan et al. study, multiple clinicians have published case reports on patients diagnosed with myocarditis who are COVID-19 positive. In two cases, the patients presented with only cardiac symptoms and were not initially suspected to have the COVID-19 disease. For example, in the report by Incardi et al. a 53-year-old woman presented with fatigue and hypotension with diffuse ST elevation and elevated troponins so coronary angiography was performed but negative. Given her symptoms and the current outbreak the team suspected myocarditis and their hypothesis was strengthened when she was found to be COVID-19 positive. Myocarditis was confirmed with cardiac MRI showing marked biventricular edema and gadolinium enhancement[39]. Similarly, in a series of four case reports by Fried et al. one of the patients had no symptoms other than chest pressure but was eventually found to be COVID-19 positive and again diagnosed with myocarditis[40].",

While it is intuitive that the underlying cardiovascular disease burden may decrease the body's reserve to fight a severe infection, the data is far from definitive. Many recent studies have indicated CVD as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease [19,20,21]. A summary of 44,672 COVID-19 cases documented by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention demonstrated a case fatality rate of 10.5% with comorbid CVD compared to a 2.4% overall case fatality rate [2]. A meta-analysis by Bo Li et. al. of 1527 patients mostly in Wuhan, China indicated the prevalence of hypertension, cardiac and cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes to be 17.1%, 16.4%, and 9.7% respectively among patients with COVID-19. A sub-group analysis showed that cardiac and cerebrovascular disease was present in 16.7% of cases requiring ICU admission, while only 6.2% of non-ICU cases [20].
