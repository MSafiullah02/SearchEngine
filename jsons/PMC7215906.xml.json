There have been huge differences in the pursuit of the most appropriate policies for, and effective methods of, testing potential carriers, their contacts, health workers and other emergency service workers. Given that on 9th January 2020 SARS-CoV-2 was definitively identified by the Chinese CDC as the causative agent for COVID-19 pneumonia and that its genomic sequence (GenBank accession number MN908947) was made available on 10th January, it is extraordinary that by the time the earliest documented transmission within the UK appeared on 28th February, no definitive action plan, stockpile of assays and required consumables, RNA extraction robots or high throughput qPCR instruments had been assembled to allow immediate and widespread RT-qPCR testing. Furthermore, the unwillingness to decentralise testing, both with regards to which assays were being used and where the testing was carried out, contributed to a farcical situation, on 11th March, where an increase from 1500 to 10,000 tests per day was considered to be a positive achievement.",

Amazingly, in a recent newspaper article, a British professor of medicine wrongly referred to RT-qPCR as an \u201cantigen\u201d test. It is therefore not surprising that politicians, journalists and the general public fail to understand what tests are available, how they differ in methodology and the different uses they have in virus detection and patient surveillance. Clearly, one of the major questions then relates to the RT-qPCR-based testing procedures used to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in potentially infected individuals.",

Its conceptual simplicity has made it the most widely used technique in molecular biology and it can, in theory, detect as little as a single fragment of DNA. Hence, it is widely used as a diagnostic test for a huge range of bacterial, fungal, viral and parasite pathogens. However, the genome of coronaviruses consists of ribonucleic acid (RNA) rather than DNA. Whilst RNA is similar to DNA, it is sufficiently different that Taq polymerase, the standard enzyme used for DNA amplification, replicates it only very inefficiently. Consequently, RNA is detected by a variant of the PCR test, termed reverse transcription (RT)-PCR [2].This encompasses a two-step method, typically comprising two enzymes; the first step uses a RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, also known as a reverse transcriptase, to copy RNA into DNA (cDNA), the second step then switches to the use of Taq polymerase, which amplifies the cDNA as in a standard PCR test (Figure 1).",

            "text": "One of the valuable advantages of RT-qPCR is the ease with which RNA in general, and viral load specifically, can be quantified, if adequate assay parameters are established and appropriate controls are included [5]. The quantification cycle (Cq) is at the heart of accurate and reproducible quantification using RT-qPCR. Fluorescence values are recorded during every cycle and represent the amount of product amplified up to that point in the amplification reaction. The more template present at the beginning of the reaction, the fewer cycles it takes to reach a point at which the fluorescent signal is first recorded as statistically significant above background. This point is defined as the Cq and will always occur during the exponential phase of amplification. Therefore, quantification is not affected by any reaction components becoming limited in the plateau phase [2]. However, it is important not to rely solely on the Cq when reporting results, as Cq values are subject to inherent inter-run variation [6] and should not be used without appropriate calibration standards [5]. One obvious way to achieve reliable quantification is to include an RNA molecule of known copy number as a spike with the RNA following extraction. This would allow both a measure of quality control, as any deviation from the expected Cq would suggest some inhibition of the reaction, as well as determination of viral copy number relative to that spike. This makes it possible to report not just a qualitative infected/not infected answer but to aim to include an assessment of viral load to measure disease progression, for example.",

Consequently, most RT-qPCR assays still take between 45 to 90 min to complete, as shown in Figure 1. It is possible to reduce this to below 20 min by a simple change of protocol [11]. This involves designing assays that generate PCR products of 60\u201380 bp, using fast RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerases such as Superscript IV and KAPA Taq polymerase, respectively, and selecting instruments capable of rapid cycling, for example Eco from PCRMax. This allows the RT step to be limited to 2 min or less, with the denaturation and annealing/polymerisation steps limited to 1 s each (Figure 3). As a result, a test can be completed in well below 20 min, with most time taken up by the instrument reading fluorescence level after each cycle. If real-time results are not required, this run could be completed in less than 10 min. Even faster run times can be achieved with other microfluidics-based instruments and experimental sub-20 s cycling times for qPCR assays (\u201cextreme PCR\u201d) have been demonstrated [12], pointing towards future virtually instantaneous PCR results.",

Samples for PCR testing for COVID-19 are usually taken from inside the nose, the mouth or the back of the throat, and careful sampling and nucleic acid preparation are important pre-test considerations. It is clearly necessary to maximise the likelihood of successfully collecting virus by meticulous sampling. Furthermore, since RT-qPCR is inhibited by many substances present in human samples [18], it is important to use nucleic acid extraction methods that remove these inhibitors. Obviously, both criteria are especially crucial to avoid false negative results. It has also become apparent that some commercial test kits, and probes and primers in particular, have been contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 sequences, with important implications for false positive detection.",

These are the SARS-CoV-2-specific primers and probe, which must be 100% specific for the virus and so amplify only viral sequences and report the increasing amount of PCR amplicon being synthesised. There are several viral genomic regions targeted by RT-qPCR assays, and multiple primer designs targeting the same genes. These include the RdRP gene (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene), the E gene (envelope protein gene), and the N gene (nucleocapsid protein gene). Importantly, it should be noted that two different sets of primers can both be 100% specific for their target but show different amplification efficiencies and so result in different sensitivities of the assays [20]. This has been observed for SARS-CoV-2 assays, where differences in the performance of the various tests have been reported [21,22] which may be due to differences in priming efficiency or protocols used, or may be associated with viral RNA secondary structure or stability. Primers are arguably the single most critical component of a reliable RT- qPCR assay, as their properties control the exquisite specificity and sensitivity that make this method uniquely powerful [19]. This is especially so for the single-tube RT-qPCR assays generally used to detect SARS-CoV-2, as the viral RNA has extensive secondary structure, which has a substantial impact on the efficiency of reverse transcription and hence the sensitivity and reliability of the whole assay [5]. Consequently, poor design combined with failure to optimise reaction conditions is likely to account for false negative results, with variable RNA sequences within the ORF1ab gene and N genes one possible cause for negative or low sensitivity results [23].",

Comprehensive testing is not hindered by availability of suitable assays, reagents, equipment or testing capacity. It is delays in the bureaucratic validation and approval process and lack of involvement of the wider research and commercial service provider community by public health laboratories that are at the heart of the testing conundrum. An immediate solution would be to centralise RNA extraction procedures in containment level 3 facilities, but devolve testing of non-infectious RNA to nation-wide laboratories, where each country has a large pool of experienced staff willing to carry out the actual testing. For future pandemics, there is an obvious need for public health organisations such as the US CDC and UK PHE to learn some significant lessons and establish protocols for emergency testing systems that can be rapidly adopted in emergency situations. For now, the Coronavirus standards working group (https://jimb.stanford.edu/covid-19-standards), led by the Joint Initiative for Metrology in Biology, is developing a set of guidelines to ensure the availability of common, appropriate standards, controls, validation tests and protocols that are essential for the accuracy of test results. They also aim to develop an annotated inventory of resources, identify gaps, and conduct international collaborative experiments to evaluate and establish comparability of the diverse control materials and test methods available. The group will institute an open information repository of validation methods and data. This should lead to collaboratively produced reference materials and samples as well as reference measurement methods to secure an enduring and reliable COVID testing enterprise.",

The RT is followed by the PCR phase, which consists of a 5 s denaturation step, during which the DNA strands separate into single strands, and a 45 s 60 \u00b0C annealing/polymerisation incubation step, during which the amplification primers (and detection probes) hybridise to the single-stranded DNA templates and allow the polymerase to replicate the template, creating double-stranded DNA. During successful polymerisation, the probe is displaced and hydrolysed, separating fluorophore and quencher and releasing fluorescence. This process is repeated, usually around 40 times (40 cycles). A typical RT-qPCR run, as exemplified here, is completed in around 1 h 27 min.

RT: Samples are incubated at around 50 \u00b0C, which results in the RT transcribing target-specific cDNA from one of the strand-specific primers on the left, with no reverse transcription on the right. B. Denaturation: Samples are heated to 95 \u00b0C, which denatures the RNA but leaves the cDNA intact. C. Annealing: the temperature is lowered to around 60 \u00b0C, with the actual temperature assay-dependent. This allows both the target-specific primers and probe to bind to their respective targets on the left, whereas primers and probe remain unbound on the right. D. Polymerisation: this step may be combined with the annealing step. On the left, the polymerase extends DNA synthesis, initially from one primer only, but after the first cycle from both, and displaces and hydrolyses any bound probe. This separates fluorophore and quencher and results in the emission of light if the fluorophore is excited at the appropriate wavelength. On the right, none of this occurs, and no light is emitted. This first cycle is followed by a further, user-defined number of cycles, indicated by the stippled arrow leading back to step B. E.
