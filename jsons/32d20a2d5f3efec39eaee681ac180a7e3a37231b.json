Iran quickly became one of the most affected countries by total COVID-19 cases and fatalities, overwhelming the country's healthcare staff. This study aims to report the health conditions (SF-12, K6, PHQ-4) and job satisfaction of healthcare staff during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when Iran reached its highest count of total active cases. We also identify the risk factors to screen for healthcare staff in greater need to prioritize mental health services.",

            "text": "Two early studies focused on only the frontline medics dealing with COVID-19 patients directly (Xiao et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) . Recently, Spoorthy (2020) reviewed the early evidence on the mental health conditions of healthcare staff. The review identified five quantitative papers on the topic, and four of them examined healthcare staff in Hubei province, the initial epicenter of the outbreak in China Kang et al., 2020; Lai et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020) , and one study conducted a cross-sectional survey of 59 doctors and nurses in Guangdong province -the second most affected province in China (Liang et al., 2020) . Despite such pioneering research, healthcare staff in Hubei faced a unique situation, as the coronavirus was initially unknown, and even the vast majority of the medical staff did not know what they were facing, calling it \"Wuhan pneumonia\". However, medical staff in other countries were well aware of COVID-19 when it later reached them. Moreover, countries vary greatly in their healthcare systems, and we still lack quantitative evidence on the conditions of healthcare staff working in a major COVD-19 outbreak area outside of China (Spoorthy, 2020) . Lastly, while this unprecedented crisis heightens everyone's appreciation of the profession of healthcare workers, no study to date has examined their job satisfaction during the outbreak, even though job satisfaction is a critical motivational resource for healthcare workers to prevent burnout (Zhang et al., 2020a) and get through the pandemic.",

Such distinct patterns of predictors among healthcare staff across countries resonant with an earlier study of the mental health of the public in Iran(Jahanshahi et al., 2020).Jahanshahi et al. (2020) suggest the predictors differed because \"different countries vary in their medical systems, the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), cultures, labor and employment conditions, the policies of lockdown, the ease of working from home and maintaining a living in a pandemic, and the information in both mainstream and social media\". Our results, hence, corroborate their suggestions, and we suggest future research to identify useful predictors of mental health in individual countries during the COVID-19 pandemic for not only the public but also healthcare staff.",
