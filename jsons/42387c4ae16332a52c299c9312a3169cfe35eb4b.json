ABSTRACT Background: SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) is a major challenge for the healthcare system and physicians, imposing changes in daily clinical activity. Aims: we aimed to describe what European trainees and young gastroenterologists know about COVID-19 and identify training gaps to implement educational programs. Methods: A prospective web-based electronic survey was developed and distributed via e-mail to all members of the Italian Young Gastroenterologist and Endoscopist Association and to European representatives. Results: One hundred and ninety-seven subjects participated in the survey, of whom 14 (7.1%) were excluded. The majority were gastroenterologists in training (123, 67.7%) working in institutions with COVID-19 inpatients (159, 86.9%), aged \u226430 years (113, 61.8%). The activity of Gastroenterology Units was restricted to emergency visits and endoscopy, with reductions of activities of up to 90%. 84.5% of participants felt that the COVID-19 outbreak impacted on their training, due to unavailability of mentors (52.6%) and interruption of trainee's involvement (66.4%). Most participants referred absence of training on the use of personal protective equipment, oxygen ventilation systems and COVID-19 therapies. Conclusion: COVID-19 outbreak significantly impacted on gastroenterologists' clinical activity.",

These data may partially provide explanations for the gastrointestinal symptoms and support the hypothesis of a faecal-oral transmission route of the infection [1, 4] . Therefore, given the wide range of reported incidences (3-79%) of gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding, gastroenterologists and endoscopists are directly involved in managing COVID-19 infections [1, 5, 6] . As this is a completely new disease, knowledge evolves rapidly day by day and dealing with this complex situation is challenging [7, 8] . With the increased need for intensive care units, European hospitals have started to markedly reduce elective activities and endoscopy, and the majority of resources were ed towards the COVID-19 pandemic [7] . These facts led to the resetting of clinical priorities and to a significant change of perspective [9] . Indeed, young gastroenterologists' (GI) training and clinical activity are moving from a model based on the concept of patient-centered care toward a concept of community-centered care. Understanding what fellows and young GIs know about COVID-19 and the changes in their daily activity aids to provide a comprehensive picture of the current situation and explores if it is possible to maintain A high-quality standard of training.",

Furthermore, fears and feelings were reported, including a lack of availability of facial masks due to limited supplies for the physicians in health-care settings [11, 12] . Thus, this survey aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the theoretical and practical competency of young GI and fellows. In this way, we emphasized the need for developing further specific activities to support young clinicians and researchers during this difficult time.",

The daily GI activity was strongly reduced, i.e. a reduction of up to 91% of the endoscopy volume was registered, corresponding to a residual volume of endoscopies of 9% compared to the activity volume before the COVID-19 outbreak.

This activity reduction could be due both to the re-assignment of gastroenterologists to COVID-19 Units and to the infective risks related to endoscopy; indeed, several position papers highlighted a significant risk of diffusion of respiratory diseases which could be spread via an airborne route, including aspiration of oral and fecal material via endoscopes [13, 14] . In addition, it is worth noting the number of participants that referred the presence of a COVID-19 positive colleague (28.4%), with a median reported rate of 10% of healthcare professionals affected COVID-19 in the Gastroenterology Units of practice. Nevertheless, we cannot assess whether the infected COVID-19 physicians were working in COVID-19 Units or not or if there is an overlap of responses from participants working in the same center, thus influencing the estimated infection rate. However, these data are in line with a recent Italian report describing the rate of COVID-19 infected physicians in Gastroenterology Units [15] . Beyond the risk of transmission related to the management of COVID-19 patients [16] , it should be underlined that cautionary measures need to be taken in all gastroenterological settings, especially in the Endoscopy Department [13] . These measures involve a preventive phone call to assess the health state of the patient before coming to the hospital and to explore the possible presence of symptoms or contacts with COVID-19 infected individuals, social distancing in the waiting room, recommendations for the patients to wear a surgical mask and gloves and the correct use from healthcare professionals of gloves, goggles, face shields, gowns, and protective respiratory equipment [13] . However, we believe that our reported rate of infected healthcare professionals is far from being acceptable in Europe and that, as a consequence, additional educational intervention are needed. For instance, on February 20 th , 2020, more than 2 thousand healthcare professionals in China were reported to be COVID-19 positive; based on these data the Chinese central government started interventions for improving the correct use of PPE, strengthened logistics, medical supplies and enhanced disinfection [17] so that this model of possible intervention should be applied also in Europe. Interestingly, only 14.8% of participants referred to have been tested themselves for COVID-19 although 28.4% of them reported that a colleague was infected. These facts underline the need for periodical screening programs for healthcare professionals [18, 19] . However, even though the participants were tested only in case of close contacts with infected colleagues, our data still show that only 50% of participants with an infected colleague were tested; thus, the conclusion that may be drawn is that this emerging COVID-19 under-testing policy could influence the spread of the infection not only among healthcare professionals but also among patients [19] .",

According to the multivariate analysis, the factors most closely related to this feeling were the reduction in outpatients' activities and the non-involvement of the trainees by mentors in certain activities. Importantly, through this Survey we propose new possible solutions to address the training gap such as extending the training period or increase the number of future hands-on courses in collaboration with academies and societies. It is noteworthy that the training gap reported is even wider than that reported for surgical training programs [20] . One potential explanation is that in most European countries, the clinical activities of gastroenterologists partially overlap with those of internists. As a consequence, gastroenterologists are often involved in COVID-19 Units. Several authors proposed, as a possible solution, the involvement in telemedicine activities of the trainees with a light workload during the COVID-19 outbreak, although evolution of the health systems is necessary to reach this goal [20, 21] . Further innovative solutions may be the flipped classroom model, online practice questions, teleconferencing, procedural simulation, and videos, even if the useful hands-on skills remain outside of these solutions [10, 22, 23] .",

Second, we provide real-life data by reporting the current impact of COVID-19 on healthcare professionals infection in Europe, although his may be biased by the fact that this is the exclusive point of view of gastroenterologists and trainees. Finally, most subjects involved were gastroenterologists in training, thus we strongly emphasize the GI training gap by raising attention to the need to address this issue. However, we believe that our findings could be the starting point for Societies and Institutions to find solutions to meet further needs for all clinicians, for GI fellows and young gastroenterologists. On the other hand, this survey has some limits: since this was an anonymous web-based Survey, we were unable to obtain information other than that reported in the questionnaire; in addition, concerning the extraordinary nature of the events, it was not possible for us to use validated questionnaires or to use questions with pre-validated scales. Furthermore, some heterogeneity in our results may be influenced by the different kinetics of the contagion we are witnessing in the various European countries.",

The resources currently allocated to implement specific training for the management of COVID-19 patients and the attempts to go ahead with the usual gastroenterological training programs seem to be insufficient. Keeping abreast of the educational needs is the next goal to achieve. The identification of training gaps will help Academies and scientific societies in the near future to develop new resources and programs to meet the needs of gastroenterologists for improving their education.
