Influence of these factors has been subject to much study. One important factor, particularly in high priced dwellings in cities like Hong Kong (Kalra, Mihaljek, & Duenwald, 2000), is the view that can be seen from a residential unit. It has been accepted that homebuyers are willing to pay more for a scenic view; a good view can increase the market price of an apartment by anywhere between 8% and 60%. However, most studies represent views by pictorial description of a scene, such as landscape, lake, and ocean views (Rodriguez and Sirmans, 1994, Tse and Lovem, 2000). Only some have carefully defined the quality of view to allocate a premium on value. Brown and Pollakowski (1977) found that a shorter distance from the waterfront significantly increased house price in Seattle. Benson, Hansen, Schwartz, and Smersh (1998) made an attempt to classify sea views into 4 performance levels ranging from full sea view to poorer partial sea view.",

In constructing viewshed variables, information of the built landscape features of the subject property is required. This is less of a problem for a new development, or for urban and natural resource planning. It is difficult to capture a residential unit\u2019s view obstruction due to poor availability of high resolution spatial data for buildings, especially their locations and heights, which are rarely reflected in commonly available maps; collecting these data can be complicated because of the time, effort and expense involved (Sander & Manson, 2007). Furthermore, a viewshed analysis basically assesses the visibility of a viewpoint for an area of interest (view). A value of unity indicates that the viewpoint is visible, while a value of zero indicates that the viewpoint is not visible (Kim, Rana, & Wise, 2004). In high-density urban developments like Hong Kong, uniform high-rise buildings are closely packed to create a solid wall-effect that blocks the view (Giridhara, Ganesan, & Lau, 2004). As such, even when spending is allowed, the variation in viewshed value will be too small to provide a precise measure of view obstruction. This explains why viewshed analysis, if conducted to measure a property\u2019s views, is confined to property developments where there is an unobstructed distinguished view nearby (Germino, Reiners, Blasko, McLeod, & Bastian, 2001).",

It is noted that most building environmental assessment schemes in use nowadays combine views and overshadowing performance as a single assessment criterion to assess impact of neigbouring buildings in respect of access to daylight and views (HK-BEAM, 2004, LEED, 2008). Several lawsuits have also combined the obstruction of view and light by neigbouring obstacles as into one single complaint (CPC, 2010, Law Letter, 1995). In Hong Kong, site planners and architects adopt a simplified method called the unobstructed vision area (UVA) method, originally developed for quantifying the visible sky area (Ng, 2003), to demonstrate compliance with performance-based requirements of daylight availability in buildings (BD, 2010), though proper application of the UVA method is subject to many constraints (Cheung and Chung, 2007, Chung and Cheung, 2006). Nevertheless, it can be seen that assessing availability of daylight is widely accepted as an alternative means for assessing view obstruction.",

Assuming homebuyers are willing to pay a premium for a better view, site planners and architects, while designing the building configuration to maximize positive views, need to have broad estimates of the premium of different types of views can command. In other words, while they can calculate the cost, they need to know the likely revenue. Considering that most stakeholders in the property market do not have the technical background to conduct theoretical modeling and simulations, or a meticulous site survey to ascertain the view obstruction of a residential unit, the objective of this study is to formulate a simple, and yet scientific method based only on geometrical primitives of a residential unit, for assessing view obstruction. In formulating the simplified method, reference is made to the influence of external obstacles on daylight availability owing to interactive characteristics of view obstruction and daylight availability.",

The equal angle approach uses altitude and azimuth values to index the shading mask, which is often considered a simpler method (Marsh, 2005). Obviously, the smaller the size of each segment, the greater will be the accuracy of calculations. CIE (1994) suggested that for daylight calculations, segments with a solid angle of approximately 0.2 radians, i.e. 11.5 degree, are small enough to be considered as point sources without significant error. Reference is also made to a computer simulation package HTB2 adopting the shading mask concept to estimate the inter-shadowing effect on solar heat gain through windows and on conduction heat transfer through envelope (Alexander, 1994). In HTB2, 10 degree segments are used. This corresponds to the 324 equal area segments (i.e. 0\u2013360\u00b0 from azimuth, and 0\u201390\u00b0 horizon to zenith).

Detailed description of Ecotect simulation can be found on the product website (Marsh, 2010). In preparation for the simulation, a scaled three-dimensional (3D) model of the target building, together with the neighboring buildings and other external objects and structures within a circumference of 500 m were drawn by using AutoCAD. AutoCAD was used because it is popular in the construction industry, and is compatible with Ecotect. The site boundary was determined based on findings of Chau, Wong, and Yiu (2005), indicating that a view with a premium refers to the panoramic view within 500 m of the living This is consistent with distance zone suggested by other studies (Bishop and Hulseb, 1994, Leeds et al., 2008). As for the target unit, the apertures and the fenestration details including fins and canopy were precisely drawn (Fig. 1\n), while other surfaces were modeled as flat planes. On exporting the AutoCAD files to Ecotect, a shading mask table for each window surface is generated. In this study, window pane position was assumed the standing position for a specific view.",

On the basis of the findings, it is recommended that for high-rise high-density urban environments like Hong Kong, where the view obstruction level differs only slightly among residential units, view should be represented by daylight obstruction to enable scientific allocation of a premium for view obstruction. Accordingly, shading mask was adopted to assess view obstruction. Case studies were conducted to confirm that the mean shading mask value (SMK\u00af) can be effectively used to represent the subjective view obstruction level of a residential unit as checked from 1:1000 digital maps and by site visits. Along the conceptual background of shading mask, a simple parameter, i.e. the average angle of obstruction (\u03b8\u00af), which can be determined based on the geometrical primitives of a residential unit was established as an alternative to shading mask simulations. The SMK\u00af and \u03b8\u00af of 708 residential units randomly selected from two representative residential developments in Hong Kong were determined for a correlation analysis. Comparison of SMK\u00af determined by the detailed computer simulation method and the calculated \u03b8\u00af showed a strong correlation (R\n2\n = 0.83 and 0.93). The strong correlation confirmed that \u03b8\u00af can be used as a simple parameter to assess daylight obstruction of a residential unit. Upon the establishment of \u03b8\u00af, a monetary value for different view qualities can be more accurately determined. Accordingly, stakeholders will be provided with useful information to enable an objective and continuous evaluation of view obstruction of a residential unit for an optimum decision.",

Given view obstruction is associated with solar access, it will be useful if further research can be conducted to evaluate if \u03b8\u00af can be used to simultaneously represent view obstruction and solar access. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that property price can also affected by other characteristics of a residential unit (e.g. floor area). Further research in this area is also needed.",
