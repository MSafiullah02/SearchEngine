            "text": "Objective: Lung-toxin Dispelling Formula No. 1, referred to as Respiratory Detox Shot (RDS), was developed based on a classical prescription of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and the theoretical understanding of herbal properties within TCM. Therapeutic benefits of using RDS for both disease control and prevention, in the effort to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) , have been shown. However, the biochemically active constituents of RDS and their mechanisms of action are still unclear. The goal of the present study is to clarify the material foundation and action mechanism of RDS. Methods: To conduct an analysis of RDS, an integrative analytical platform was constructed, including target prediction, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, and cluster analysis; further, the hub genes involved in the disease-related pathways were identified, and the their corresponding compounds were used for in vitro validation of molecular docking predictions. The presence of these validated compounds was also measured in samples of the RDS formula to quantify the abundance of the biochemically active constituents. In our network pharmacological study, a total of 26 bioinformatic programs and databases were used, and six networks, covering the entire Zang-fu viscera, were constructed to comprehensively analyze the intricate connections among the compounds-targets-disease pathways-meridians of RDS. Results: For all 1071 known chemical constituents of the nine ingredients in RDS, identified from established TCM databases, 157 passed drug-likeness screening and led to 339 predicted targets in the constituent-target network. Forty-two hub genes with core regulatory effects were extracted from the PPI network, and 134 compounds and 29 crucial disease pathways were implicated in the target-constitu ent-disease network. Twelve disease pathways attributed to the Lung-Large Intestine meridians, with six and five attributed to the Kidney-Urinary Bladder and Stomach-Spleen meridians, respectively. Onehundred and eighteen candidate constituents showed a high binding affinity with SARS-coronavirus-2 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ), as indicated by molecular docking using computational pattern recognition. The in vitro activity of 22 chemical constituents of RDS was validated using the 3CL pro inhibition assay. Finally, using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in data-independent analysis mode, the presence of seven out of these 22 constituents was confirmed and validated in an aqueous decoction of RDS, using reference standards in both non-targeted and targeted approaches. Conclusion: RDS acts primarily in the Lung-Large Intestine, Kidney-Urinary Bladder and Stomach-Spleen meridians, with other Zang-fu viscera strategically covered by all nine ingredients. In the context of TCM meridian theory, the multiple components and targets of RDS contribute to RDS's dual effects of healthstrengthening and pathogen-eliminating. This results in general therapeutic effects for early COVID-19 control and prevention.",

The nine TCM ingredients in this prescription have been used together as an herbal formula in clinical practice for more than a decade and have been effective for the prevention and treatment of acute respiratory tract infections, as well as the common cold and flu. In recent months, clinical trials of RDS have been conducted to evaluate its efficacy in patients with severe/critical COVID-19 pneumonia, finding that RDS has treatment value and no observed side effects [10] . Additionally, eight out of the nine ingredients in RDS are plantderived; the other ingredient is honeycomb. All nine ingredients are approved as dietary supplements by the United States Food and Drug Administration, indicating that their long-term use is considered to be safe in the US. RDS has therapeutic benefits in both disease prevention and treatment against COVID-19; these benefits may have global significance [10] .",

This knowledge could help to develop an early prevention and treatment scheme to manage COVID-19 pneumonia. In this study, the ability of the active constituents of RDS to bind with SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro (6LU7) was evaluated using computational pattern recognition to test the likelihood of molecular docking. Finally, the chemical constituents present in RDS were tested against the putative biochemically active constituents identified in this study using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC), coupled with tandem mass spectrometry in data-independent analysis mode (MS E ) with non-targeted and targeted approaches. Through the above studies, biochemically active constituents from the RDS formula and their likely pathways of action were identified.",

Information on individual chemical constituents was further processed with SEA, TargetNet and SwissTargetPrediction databases to further describe their predicted targets, as described in our earlier study [19, [35] [36] [37] .

The higher the RSS score is, the stronger the RDS effect on the hub genes. There are 11 genes most strongly affected by the compounds in RDS. Thus, these 11 genes may play a more significant role in therapeutic effects of RDS prescription. From the 42 hub genes, 39 pathways were identified from the pathway enrichment analysis, and the most important were signal transduction, transport and catabolism, cell growth and death, cellular community-eukaryotes, immune system, neural system, nervous system, development and regeneration (Fig. 5 ).

            "text": "Based on the ''disease-targets-constituents\" network, the five most connected genes were ESR1, HSP90AA1, AR, PPARG and GSK3B; this result agreed with the protein-protein interaction analysis shown in Fig. 3 . All five genes were in key nodes of the RDS network, indicating that these compounds and targets may play a greater regulatory function in the RDS network. Delving further into the biological functions of the five genes and their proteins, all have significant roles in gene expression, cellular proliferation and differentiation, while PPARG and GSK3B are also involved in lipid and glucose metabolism, respectively. RDS may affect these crucial host cellular pathways to enhance overall health of the body and improve the body's ability to fight against viruses. Unlike SARS, where the most affected organ is the lung, the new coronavirus attacks not only the lung, but also the heart, kidneys, intestines and other organs, causing multiple organ failure within a short time window. Although the disease is located in the lung and requires immediate medical care, in TCM theory it is necessary to consider that deficiency of the Lung will affect the Stomach and the Spleen and damage the Heart and the Kidneys as well. Based on the analysis of the ingredients and meridian tropism network, seven out of nine ingredients enter the Lung meridian, because the disease is located in the Lungs and should be treated with priority. Through the present analysis, which incorporates elements of allopathic medicine and TCM meridian tropism, it can be seen that TCM encompasses therapeutic effects that may extend beyond our current scientific, measurable understanding of the disease process. Fortunately, the lack of precision in pairing TCM's theoretical framework with the currently-known understanding of COVID-19 has not hindered its successful application in this critical disease. The RDS formula focuses on, and often successfully treats, the body as a whole, rather than treating isolated symptoms. The present network analysis used an integrative perspective to explore connections and interactions among the chemical constituents of the RDS formula, their targets and pathways, as well as how the bioactive components of RDS may work on the human body to combat COVID-19. However, it is unknown whether the candidate compounds in RDS have any anti-coronavirus activity, such as blocking the penetration, uncoating or synthesis of viral proteins or nucleic acids. The SARS-CoV-2 3CL pro (PDB: 6LU7) is required for the replication of coronaviruses and considered a validated target in the design of potential anti-coronavirus inhibitors [20, 22, 23] . A computational strategy for modeling molecular docking was used to evaluate the affinity between candidate constituents of RDS and 3CL pro . This technique helps to identify RDS constituents that may interact directly with SARS-CoV2 (Fig. 7) . After preliminary screening, 48 constituents demonstrated binding affinity with 3CL pro ; using commercially available samples of these constituents, 22 out of the 48 had inhibition rates greater than 50% at a concentration of 100 mmol/L, in the 3CL pro inhibition assay (unpublished data). These results indicate that the bioactive constituents of RDS might possess direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in addition to their effects on the body. In the phytochemical analysis of RDS, about 80% of the constituents identified were provided by four of the nine herbs in the formula. The other five herbs each contained fewer than 10 of the identified constituents. Based on the results from the virtual screening and the in vitro 3CL pro inhibition assay, seven out of 22 bioactive constituents could be identified and confirmed using LC-MS targeted extraction and analysis ( Table 3 ). The results suggested that these seven bioactive compounds could be used in a subsequent study for drug discovery and could be important makers for quality control testing of the prescription.",

            "text": "Inspired by the fact that the TCM prescription, Lung-toxin Dispelling Formula No. 1 (RDS), has been successfully used clinically to treat severe and critical cases of COVID-19 in China, and has been used as a preventive dietary supplement for COVID-19 in the US, this study applied network pharmacology, molecular docking and UPLC/QTOF MS approaches to reveal the complex interactions between the TCM prescription and the disease. In this study, the multi-faceted system of TCM prescription has been integrated with the targets, disease pathways and their Zang-fu viscera to show an intricate network of interaction. This work shows that applying modern biological and pharmacological technologies to TCM research can deepen the mechanistic understanding of TCM compound formulas and better promote their clinical application. There is no doubt that the establishment of novel prescriptions based on TCM theory requires more effective integration of subdisciplines and technologies.",
