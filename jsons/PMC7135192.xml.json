As time went on, many other complications of the disease and also of the treatment became apparent. Neuropsychiatric manifestations were among these complications. We saw patients attempted suicide during quarantine period, delirium was not uncommon [5], and many were anxious and worrying. Furthermore, many patients had neuropsychiatric symptoms persisted after discharge, and some patients developed new symptoms in the recovery phase. SARS had strong reasons to cause adverse neuropsychiatric impacts. It affected the whole family, either as being patients or patient contacts that required quarantine observations. High dose corticosteroids we used in the treatment, especially in the early epidemic when our knowledge on SARS was limited, had exposed patients to possible steroid related adverse effects. SARS was also a lethal disease and many patients required mechanical ventilation in intensive care units (ICU). Because of the contagious nature and unknown route of transmission, the disease carried a negative stigmatization. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the relative contributions of disease severity, use of corticosteroids and social factors on the symptoms in various neuropsychiatric domains in acute and convalescent phases.",

The questionnaires were administered by mail in early June 2003 with return envelopes. To encourage reply we gave phone call to all patients before sending them questionnaires. One of the questionnaires, the SARS Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Checklist (NPSC), was specifically designed to evaluate the neuropsychiatric complaints after SARS according to our initial experiences [5]. It consisted of 25 items covering six neuropsychiatric domains of interest (see Appendix for questionnaire), namely cognition (Q1\u20134), mania (Q5\u20138), depression (Q9\u201315), anxiety (Q16\u201318), psychosis (Q19\u201321) and behavioural symptoms (Q22\u201325). The items were scored on a four-point ordinal scale with \u20180\u2019 representing \u2018none\u2019 and \u20183\u2019 \u2018always\u2019. This questionnaire was duplicated into four. Two questionnaires were administered by patients and two were administered by their families. The first set was rated to the best of their recall during hospital stay (at acute phase), and the second set was rated according to their present state (at convalescent phase). The questionnaires administered by family members served to evaluate the reliability of the information provided by the patient. Severity of the SARS symptoms was recorded on a separate eight-item checklist using an ordinal scale from 0 to 3, which gave a maximum possible score of 24. We also included General Health Questionnaire 28 (GHQ28) as a screening tool for psychological well being at convalescent phase [3]. The study was approved by local ethics committee, and informed consent was obtained from every participant.",

We believed families were difficult to observe the behavioural changes because they were not allowed to have direct patient contact during hospital stay. Cronbach \u03b1, which indicated the lower bound of inter-item correlation in a cluster of items [8], revealed a good internal consistency in the cognition (\u03b1 = 0.70), anxiety (\u03b1 = 0.78) and depression (\u03b1 = 0.83).

Although we did not have information on psychological well being in the community during the epidemic as a control, our findings did show an impact from the factors we studied on the neuropsychiatric symptoms, both at acute and convalescent phases. Our patients were treated in isolation settings and had lots of uncertainties on their health. These were similar to patients treated in ICU where many have developed PTSD as a result [10], [11].

They were prone to develop overt psychological reactions under great stress like massive casualties [1], [24]. In fact many unaffected staffs were carried away with unhappy memories during the epidemic. Many recovering health care workers still had problem of confidence and role adjustments. Some felt guilty on transmitting the disease to their families, and some staffs found themselves being isolated from other colleagues. They also worried about potential occupational hazards in the future, compensation issues, insurances, new hospital policies, etc. To address the importance of psychological health, the hospital has incorporated psychology sessions in the newly implemented infection control trainings. We encouraged psychology modules in medical and nursing schools, and consultation services should be easily assessable by all frontline medical staffs.",

Through its effect on hippocampal metabolism, a big dose of exogenous steroid could induce reversible memory impairments as shown both in healthy subjects [16] and in treatment of multiple sclerosis patients [19]. Chronic stimulation in the case of Cushing's disease could cause atrophy of the hippocampus [27]. Poor memory could also be a symptom of CFS which frequently accompanied with viral infections [6]. Adrenal insufficiency after steroid withdrawal is another possibility, especially when both the dosage was high and the duration was long. Further study is definitely required.",
