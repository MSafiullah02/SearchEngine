It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan City (Chang et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020). To April 17, 2020, there are about 2,200,000 confirmed cases worldwide (CSSE, 2020). This virus in different cities has presented a value of R0 (Reproductive number of): 2.2 and 3.5 (Liu et al., 2020). This epidemic has a high rate of spread and a high case fatality rate (Wang et al., 2020).",
