In addition, the results of the culture were similar upon a successful sinus surgery [29]. All in all, these reports confirmed the bacterial role in the CRS pathogenesis. Although, a few of the differences were most likely due to the discrepancies in the procedures [17], associated allergic rhinitis [30], prior antibiotic administration and source of material (sinus or nasal).
