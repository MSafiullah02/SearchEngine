This class accommodates about half of all virus groups presently approved by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses, i.e., ca. 35 of 70 (1, 2) . An important descriptor of each of these groups is what is often called genome strut-egy, i.e., the repertoire of molecular mechanisms utilized by the virus to express and replicate its genome (e.g., 3, 4) . The diversity of specific variants of positivestrand RNA virus genome strategies is enormous, almost frustrating, at least upon a superficial glance. Hence, there is a strong need for a rational classification of these strategies.",

This is particularly relevant for positive-strand RNA viruses, where representative complete genome sequences of over 20 groups have been reported (5, 6) . Knowing the genome sequence of a virus does not directly disclose its replication and expression mechanisms. Nevertheless, the sequence information is of great value for understanding the genome strategy, allowing verification and correction of the notions based on biochemical evidence. With these data, it now seems timely to discuss a simple version of classification of positive-strand RNA virus genome strategies. The purposes of this classification are multiple: a) methodological and didactical, facilitating conceptualization of specific replication and expression mechanisms; b) heuristic, allowing the prediction of new strategies; c) finally, it is of major interest to assess, for each genome strategy, the cases for its monophyletic or polyphyletic origin, i.e., the relationship between the genome strategies and virus evolution, or in other words, between divergence and convergence in the evolution of genome strategies. In what follows no attempt has been made to present a comprehensive survey of the relevant literature (a hardly feasible task, in fact), and only reviews and selected original papers containing the most illuminating (from the author's point of view) observations are cited.",

For the proposed classification to be useful, it is crucial that the optimal set of characters, i.e., replication and expression modes, be defined. Clearly, it is impossible to include all specific mechanisms. Thus the set of \"fundamental\" characters is to be delineated somehow. A simple idea is that those mechanisms that are conserved within large groups of viruses, or among several groups, can be considered to be fundamental. This is warranted by the notion that most of the presently recognized virus groups are apparently monophyletic (5, 7, 8) , and the conserved mechanisms are probably ancestral and have been strongly selected for in the course of evolution.",

Establishment of such mechanisms as polyprotein processing and subgenomic mRNA formation requires evolutionary breakthroughs, i.e, the development of virus-encoded proteases specific for distinct cleavage sites, and probably of proteins (domains) involved in the initiation of subgenomic mRNA transcription (3). This evolutionary \"work\" would be redundant for polycistronic RNAs typical of prokaryotic viruses. On the contrary, in eukaryotic viruses, utilization of truly polycistronic mRNAs is precluded by the strong bias against internal initiation by the eukaryotic translation machinery (9); hence, the driving force for evolution of new mechanisms.",

For genome strategies, this means that the probability of discovering a yet to be found strategy in a newly studied virus group (i.e., of filling an empty partition in the classification table) can be assessed. It would be of major interest to try to realize what (if any) of the not yet found strategies are \"prohibited\" by some fundamental principles, and what are likely to be eventually identified. It is to be stated explicitly that no such fundamental \"prohibitions\" are currently known. On the other hand, we believe that the chances for realization of different strategies are far from equal. First, there are three pairs of actually observed pairs of strategies with and without genome segmentation: AS-A6, A7-A8, and B3-B4. Thus it seems most likely that complementary strategies exploiting segmentation should also exist for strategies A3, B5, and B7, i.e., strategies A4, B6, and B8 are likely to be found in newly characterized virus groups. The situation seems to be somewhat different, with the A2 strategy corresponding to putative RNA bacteriophages with multipartite genomes. The same logic that was forwarded above with respect to the possibility of combination of polycistronic RNA with other expression mechanisms can be applicable here. Specifically, one can argue that, given the ability to utilize multiple ribosome entry sites within a single piece of RNA, genome segmentation would be of no selective advantage. On the other hand, the ~$6 bacteriophage genome consists of three segments of doublestrand RNA, the transcript of each segment being itself a polycistronic RNA (43) .",

Such viruses would express their proteins by the simple principle of \"one segment-one protein,\" without any additional mechanisms. In fact, the putative A9 strategy closely resembles that exploited by tricornaviruses (A6). The only tricomavirus subgenomic mRNA, the one encoding the capsid protein, is incorporated into virions (RNA 4) and is required for infectivity when the infection is initiated with purified virus RNA (45) . The only deviation from the putative A9 strategy is that RNA 4 also constitutes the 3' part of RNA 3 and is synthesized as a subgenomic RNA by internally initiated transcription (46) . Evidence has been presented that RNA 3 could arise by the fusion of two RNA segments (47) . If so, a hypothetical ancestral tricornavirus (or, more precisely, \"four\"cornavirus.) could exploit the A9 strategy. It will be of interest to learn whether this strategy is utilized by some yet unexplored extant virus, and if not, what might be the specific selective advantage conferred by subgenomic mRNA formation. As a matter of speculation, it is possible to propose that such an advantage might lie in the possibility of selective enhancement of subgenomic mRNA transcription required for the abundant production of the capsid protein. Similar considerations could, in principle, apply to the B9 strategy, but its realization seems to be somewhat less likely because of the correlation between VPg-mediated replication and polyprotein processing discussed above.",
