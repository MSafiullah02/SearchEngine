To compare the novel Luminex-based NxTAG-Respiratory Pathogen Panel (NxTAG-RPP) with the routine multiplex-ligation-NAT based RespiFinder-22 1 (RF-22), 282 respiratory specimens including nasopharyngeal swabs (71%), broncho-alveolar lavage (27%), throat swabs, tracheal secretions, and sputum (2%) from 116 children and 155 adults were extracted using a Corbett CAS1200 (Qiagen), and analyzed in parallel by the routine RF-22 and NxTAG-RPP. Concordant results were obtained in 263 (93.3%) cases consisting of concordant positives in 167 (59.2%) and concordant negatives in 96 (34%). Results were discordant in 19 (6.7%) consisting of 15 positive:negative, and 4 negative:positive results by NxTAG-RPP versus RF-22, respectively. Co-infections were observed in 10.3% with NxTAG-RPP and in 5.9% with RF-22. Most additional viral pathogens identified by the NxTAG-RPP involved dual infections with rhinovirus and RSV. Discordant samples were mainly due to low genome signals of C t less than 36, when retested by QNAT suggesting a higher sensitivity of the NxTAG-RPP, also when detecting multiple infections. Hands-on time after extraction for 24 and 96 samples was 0.25 and <0.5 hr for the NxTAG-RPP, and 2 and 4 hr for the RF-22, respectively. The median turn-around time was 6 hr (range 5-7 hr) for NxTAG-RPP and 12 hr (range 8-16 hr) for RF-22. The NxTAG-RPP showed comparable detection rates for most respiratory pathogens, while hands-on and turn-around time were considerably shorter. The clinical significance of detecting multiple viruses needs further clinical evaluation.",

            "text": "Respiratory tract infection (RTI) involves a wide variety of different etiologic agents among viruses and bacteria. With increasing availability of specific and sensitive diagnostic assays using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT), it has become clear that the etiological diagnosis based on signs and symptoms is unreliable, since the clinical presentation of different causative agents is often similar, especially in immunocompromised patients [Ison, 2012; Hirsch et al., 2013] . Of note, this limitation also applies to periods of higher pretest probability as during epidemics, as reported previously Grondahl et al., 2014] . Therefore, rapid and correct identification of RTI agents is important for infection control and treatment strategies. Although near-patient testing is available and particularly important for treating influenza [Khanna et al., 2009; Beckmann and Hirsch, 2015] , negative results are not satisfactory, especially for immunocompromised patients [Ison, 2012; Hirsch et al., 2013] . This challenge is most conveniently tackled by NAT for multiple pathogens in parallel. Multiplex NAT platforms are able to detect different viruses and bacteria in a single assay, but are often technically demanding in preparation, processing, and read-outs, which increase the hands-on-time (HOT) and affect the turn-around-time (TAT) [Caliendo, 2011] . In 2009, we routinely introduced the RespiFinder platform [Reijans et al., 2008] to identify respiratory pathogens in symptomatic children and adults Nickel et al., 2009; Sidler et al., 2012] , which detects 22 different pathogens using a multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) coupled to capillary electrophoresis (RF-22). However, the procedure is demanding with considerable HOT and the current TAT of 8-16 hr is limiting its clinical utility, especially in immunocompromised and critically ill patients. Therefore, we compared the RF-22 with the NxTAG-respiratory pathogen panel (NxTAG-RPP), which combines a multiplex RT-PCR with bead hybridization for detection and identification of 18 viruses and 3 bacteria associated with virus-like RTI.",

The NxTAG-RPP is a closed-tube assay, consisting of a multiplex reverse transcription PCR and hybridization in a single step 96-well format requiring a HOT of less than 15 min for both 24 or 96 samples, and a TAT of 5 hr. The NxTAG-RPP results were obtained as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) measured by the Luminex MAGPIX instrument and a research use only version of the TDAS software. MFI values above the threshold for a particular pathogen indicated a detectable target (positive result). The limit of detection was target dependent and indicated by the manufacturer. RF-22 served as the primary reference test. Discordant results led to re-testing using local in-house quantitative PCRs (QNAT). Three specimens were sent to an external reference laboratory (Drs. C. Tapparell-Vu, L. Kaiser, University Hospital Geneva).",

In this study, we present the direct comparison of our current routine assay, the RespiFinder-22 1 (RF-22) with the novel NxTAG-RPP for RTI specimens from symptomatic adults and children. The overall concordance between both assay results was high with 263 (93.3%) samples and an overall positivity rate of more than 50%. The leading pathogens were rhino-/enterovirus, parainfluenzavirus, influenzavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (Fig. 1B) . The pathogenspecific results were highly concordant for parainfluenzavirus-1, -2, -4, respiratory syncytial virus A and B, human metapneumovirus, influenza A (H3), influenza A (H1N1), influenza B, human coronaviruses 229E and HKU1, and Legionella pneumophila (k-value 1.0) (Table IIA) , whereas adenovirus, rhino-/enterovirus, human bocavirus, para-influenzavirus-3, and human coronaviruses OC43 had slightly lower k-values of !0.9. The most striking differences were observed for human coronaviruses NL63 (k-value 0.83) and M. pneumonia (k-value 0.80), which is still interpreted as an almost perfect agreement though the positivity rate was too low to draw conclusions. All discordant results that were verified by QNAT were associated with high cycle threshold (C T ) values, indicating low genome loads (data not shown). The detection of additional rhino-/ enterovirus was the single most important cause for discordance and seems to result from a higher sensitivity of the NxTAG-RPP compared to RF-22. Clearly, the role of rhino-/enterovirus detection, particularly in dual infections, requires additional studies as pointed out recently [Milano et al., 2010; Piralla et al., 2014] . NxTAG-RPP suffered from occasionally invalid results due to a low bead count, which disappeared with more hands-on experience of the technicians. Failure of the RF-22 with invalid internal controls or other technical issues were seen in less than 2%, and required repeat testing. The specimen types consisted mostly of nasopharyngeal swabs, but BAL was submitted in one fourth of the cases, which requires an invasive procedure typically applied to patients with significant clinical problems. Of note, no difference was seen in the rates of discordant results in BAL (5/76; 6.6%) versus NPA (14/199; 7.0%) .",

M. pneumoniae was rare, and detected in two cases (2.1%) during that time period, suggesting that viruses are the main cause of RTIs in pediatric and adult patients [Ruuskanen et al., 2011] . L. pneumophila as not frequent with only one positive specimen, whereas there were no positive results for Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Here, particular attention should be paid to the performance of these assays in quality assurance programs. In view of the considerable number of different pathogens to be covered, quality assurance programs become a real financial and organizational challenge for the diagnostic laboratory given the goal of a yearly participation.",

While CE marking has been obtained in the meantime, costs cannot be addressed at present. However, the ease of handling and HOT were clearly in favor of the novel NxTAG-RPP. This is largely due to the lyophilized master mix in the sealed ready-touse microtiter plates, and the bead technology, including PCR and hybridization in one step, which reduces the HOT to less than 30 min. Even for a large number of parallel samples, scalable depending on the seasonal demand to 96 test, the TAT is in the range of only 5-7 hr (median 6 hr). In contrast, the RespiFinder-22 1 had a sample number-dependent HOT being 2 and 4 hr for 24 and 96 samples, respectively (including PCR, hybridization, ligation, and denaturation), before analysis by capillary electrophoresis yielding a TAT ranging from 8 to 16 hr (median 12 hr).",
