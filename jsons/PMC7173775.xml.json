This redistribution is aimed to distribute time-dependent neurosurgical emergencies in hospitals with \u201calmost\u201d COVID-free dedicated pathways and facilities. This produced a downgrade of hospitals with a high volume of neurosurgical and neurological emergencies. High volume is an important characteristic of a hub, along with the served territory (in our case covering also remote mountains location for strokes) [1, 3]. Moreover, hubs should have teaching facilities as university-affiliated hospitals and/or could participate in international trials on trauma and cerebrovascular disease, both pharmacological and government/EU-funded research [1\u20133]. Research and teaching are among the criteria that can reflect the top-notch characteristics of an institution and a clinical group.",

At the same time, we completely agree with the colleagues when they state that \u201cin difficult times such as these, the cooperative spirit has risen spontaneously to previously unmet levels.\u201d The unexpected readiness of neurosurgeons to convert to COVID-19 doctors and the acceptance of centralizing in dedicated structures the majority of the time-dependent neurosurgical activities requiring postoperative intensive care, with teams moving between hospitals, are testimony of it.",
