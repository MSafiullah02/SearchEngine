Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in late 2002 and identification of the etiological agent as a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, several animal models have been identified for use in such evaluations. Although each model reviewed in this article has some utility in the study of SARS disease and prevention, the kinetics of viral replication and resolution of disease are much more rapid in animal models compared to human infections, and no model fully reflects the spectrum of clinical illness (morbidity and mortality), associated pathology, and viral replication observed in human cases of SARS. Of the animal models that have been employed for evaluating SARS-CoV replication and disease, those models that have been most fully characterized and which offer the best potential for evaluation of prevention and therapeutic strategies are discussed here and include inbred mice, hamsters, ferrets and non-human primates. We also reference other, less well-characterized animal models.",

The peak titer in lungs occurs at days 2\u20133 p.i., and virus is cleared in most mice by days 5\u20137 p.i. In young mice, SARS-CoV replication has not been associated with overt signs of clinical illness or pronounced pathology. However, 129S6 mice seem to be slightly more susceptible to disease associated with SARS-CoV infection than are BALB/c or B6 mice, as evidenced by an approximate 8% loss of body weight, with a nadir at days 5\u20137 p.i., and by the presence of mild interstitial pneumonitis at day 2 p.i. (Hogan et al., 2004; authors\u2019 unpublished data). Interstitial pneumonitis following SARS-CoV infection has not been previously reported in BALB/c mice when evaluated at days 2, 4 and 9 p.i. (Subbarao et al., 2004). However, slightly elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha were observed in young BALB/c mice at day 3 p.i. (authors\u2019 unpublished data), and upon recent evaluation, young BALB/c mice displayed moderate interstitial pneumonitis on day 3 p.i., comparable to that seen in B6 and Rag1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Glass et al., 2004, Roberts et al., 2007). This pneumonitis is quickly resolved and is not observed on day 4 p.i. This transient inflammation coincides with viral clearance since little viral antigen is observed at or after day 3 p.i., and virus titers in lungs also steadily decline from day 3 p.i. onwards (Subbarao et al., 2004).",

In addition to supporting viral replication in respiratory tissues, the aged BALB/c mouse (BALB/cAnNHsd, Harlan) demonstrates clinical signs of illness including weight loss, dehydration, and ruffled fur, and several histopathological findings, i.e. diffuse alveolar damage including edema, hyaline membrane formation, and pneumonitis, that correlate with those reported in autopsies of SARS patients (Roberts et al., 2005a).",

Following intranasal inoculation with 105\n TCID50 of SARS-CoV (Urbani), both B6 and 129S6 aged mice (12\u201314 months old) had weight loss (\u223c7% at the nadir) from day 3 through day 5 p.i. that was comparable to that observed in aged BALB/c mice (Roberts et al., 2005a). The level and kinetics of viral replication in lungs of aged B6 and BALB/c mice following inoculation were also similar. At days 5 and 6 p.i., SARS-CoV-infected B6 mice had 10\u201370-fold lower titers of virus than BALB/c mice (Fig. 1\n). In contrast, aged 129S6 mice did not support prolonged replication of SARS-CoV as virus was cleared from lungs by day 5 p.i. (data not shown). Nevertheless, early histopathological features in the lungs of aged B6 and 129S6 mice were similar to those seen in aged BALB/c mice following SARS-CoV infection. Changes observed in the lungs at day 3 p.i included perivascular and peribronchiolar mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, intraluminal necrotic debris in bronchioles comprised of dead respiratory epithelium and inflammatory cells, and small foci of interstitial pneumonitis (Fig. 2A, C, and E). Viral antigens were detected by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining in the respiratory epithelial cells of bronchioles and in alveolar pneumocytes of all mouse strains at day 3 p.i., but appeared most abundant in the bronchioles of 129S6 mice at this time point (Fig. 2B, C and F). Varying amounts of mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates persisted around bronchioles and small pulmonary vessels through day 9 p.i.; however, no viral antigens were detected by IHC at this time point. As previously reported, the aged BALB/c mouse has features that would make it an excellent model for evaluation of pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy studies. Based on weight loss and histopathological analyses, we believe that aged B6 and 129S6 mice may provide additional models for the study of age-dependent susceptibility to SARS-CoV. However, the drawback to widespread utility of the aged mouse model is the difficulty in procuring large numbers of mice that are over 12 months of age.",

Peak viral replication in the lungs occurs at day 3 p.i. and is cleared by day 7 p.i. Virus titers in nasal turbinates are about 10\u2013100-fold lower than in lungs, but are detectable through day 14 p.i. Viremia is detected 2\u20133 days p.i.; and virus can be recovered from the spleen and liver. Histopathological changes in the lungs accompany SARS-CoV infection of hamsters. By day 3 p.i., focal areas of interstitial inflammation and consolidation are visible. At day 5 p.i., inflammation is more pronounced and consolidation is more widespread. Consolidation continues through day 7 p.i. and involves 30\u201340% of the surface area of the lung. By day 21 p.i., pathological changes in the lung have resolved (Roberts et al., 2005b).",

AY278491), Frankfurt 1 (Frk-1; GenBank no. AY291315) and a recombinant SARS-CoV infectious clone (ic) expressing the spike protein of GD03T0013 (GenBank no. AY525636) (icGD03; Deming et al., 2006). Primary intranasal infection with 103\n TCID50/hamster with SARS-CoV (Urbani, HK-39 or Frk-1) results in virus titers of >107\n TCID50/g of lung by day 2 p.i. (Fig. 3A\u2013C), whereas primary infection with icGD03 results in significantly lower titers (104\n TCID50/g on day 2 p.i.) (Fig. 3D). Our findings suggest that compared with the Urbani strain, icGD03 is slightly attenuated in the hamster model with a 1000-fold reduction in peak virus titers in the lungs following infection, and that SARS-CoV Frk-1 may be slightly more virulent than other strains. Although dose-dependent mortality was not observed, 3 of 20 hamsters died following infection with SARS-CoV Frk-1, and peak virus titers in lungs are higher than peak virus titers following infection with Urbani or HK-39. However, the difference in peak virus titer did not achieve statistical significance (Fig. 3A\u2013C). Histopathological findings in lungs following infection with SARS-CoV (HK-39 or Frk-1) are indistinguishable from those reported following infection with SARS-CoV (Urbani) (Fig. 4\n). The spike proteins of the SARS-CoV Urbani and HK-39 isolates are identical in amino acid sequence, and the Frk-1 spike protein sequence differs from these by only one amino acid in the S2 domain (L1148F). Antibodies detected in hamster sera following primary SARS-CoV infections cross-neutralize the various virus strains and homologous viruses to comparable degrees (Urbani, Frk-1 and HK-39: \u223c1:500 to 1:1000), and hamsters infected with each of these strains of SARS-CoV are protected from re-infection with the homologous virus or heterologous viruses (Fig. 3A\u2013D).",

Various strains of SARS-CoV, including Urbani, PUMC-01 and HKU-39849, have been evaluated in rhesus macaques (McAuliffe et al., 2004, Qin et al., 2005, Rowe et al., 2004), cynomolgus macaques (Fouchier et al., 2003, Kuiken et al., 2003, Lawler et al., 2006, McAuliffe et al., 2004, Qin et al., 2006, Rowe et al., 2004), common marmosets (Greenough et al., 2005b), African green monkeys (McAuliffe et al., 2004), squirrel monkeys and mustached tamarins. Squirrel monkeys and mustached tamarins were not susceptible to SARS-CoV Urbani infection (authors\u2019 unpublished data). Virus was not detected in the respiratory tract following inoculation and monkeys did not develop antibodies to SARS-CoV. All other NHP species studied were susceptible to infection to variable degrees. Of these susceptible species, no single model is preferred to any other. Each support viral replication in lungs (Table 2\n) and viral shedding in respiratory secretions and most develop some histopathological changes consistent with human infections including infection of type I and type II pneumocytes and diffuse alveolar damage. Few vaccine candidates have been evaluated in NHPs. The vaccines that were evaluated in NHPs were efficacious in reducing titers of wild-type SARS-CoV challenge virus replication and/or histopathological changes in immunized animals compared to mock-immunized controls. Due to individual variation in responses of outbred animals, small groups of monkeys (N\n = 4 or 5) are not large enough to evaluate statistical outcomes in these studies. Therefore, special considerations should be given before conducting vaccine efficacy studies in NHPs. Challenge studies should be conducted in large numbers (N\n = 10\u201312 per group), and consideration should also be given to the history of the animals used, utilizing the highest quality of monkeys (avoiding those that have had free-range periods in life or those that are known to be infected with co-pathogens) available (Roberts et al., 2006b). In vaccine efficacy studies, immunological responses should also be evaluated. Due to the lack of available immunological reagents (including micro-array assays) for other NHP species, rhesus and cynomolgus macaques are likely to be the most informative of the non-human primate models for continued SARS research. Despite the limitations of NHP models, evaluation of vaccine candidates in NHPs may be necessary to proceed to clinical studies. The cost for large studies that will provide the needed sample size and the other special considerations mentioned will limit these vaccine efficacy studies to the most promising candidates.",

Use of these models in such evaluations would necessitate a thorough characterization of the model, including viral replication data and histopathological analysis of SARS-CoV- and mock-infected animals. Different species may prove useful for studying different aspects of SARS-CoV, and the study of pathogenesis may best be addressed in several species for which tools are available for immunological analysis, whereas vaccines and antivirals may be studied in models that allow large enough numbers for statistical evaluation.",

Wang et al., 2005), hamsters (Roberts et al., 2006a) and ferrets (ter Meulen et al., 2004) prevent or reduce SARS-CoV replication and associated disease following challenge. Monoclonal antibodies specific to the SARS spike protein administered therapeutically (i.e. after the onset of infection) prevent further increase in viral burden and reduce associated disease (e.g. consolidation) in hamsters (Roberts et al., 2006a). Sera from mice immunized with recombinant spike protein, inactivated whole SARS-CoV, live-viral vectored vaccines expressing the spike protein (VSV-S or MVA-S) or DNA vaccines (expressing SARS-S and -M proteins) have been shown to contain neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV (Table 3, Table 4\n). Passive transfer of these immune sera to naive mice prevents infection with SARS-CoV (Bisht et al., 2004, Kapadia et al., 2005, Stadler et al., 2005, Yang et al., 2004). Although cell-mediated immunity may have a protective role in viral clearance or resolution of disease in the human population, antibody alone has been shown to have both prophylactic and therapeutic benefits in animal models. The data from several studies strongly suggests that an effective SARS-CoV vaccine will be one that induces high and sustained levels of neutralizing antibodies and that administration of neutralizing MAbs specific to the SARS-CoV spike protein may be a useful strategy in post-exposure treatment and prophylaxis in at risk populations.",

These vaccines do not carry the risks of incomplete inactivation, genetic recombination with circulating viruses, or reversion to virulent phenotypes. Recombinant proteins are often also very stable. Furthermore, adjuvants such as aluminum salts (Al(OH)3 and Al2(SO4)3 or alum) or a squalene emulsion (MF59) (licensed for use in the US and Europe, respectively) may be added to the formulation of protein-based vaccines to increase immunogenicity.",

Potential benefits of inactivated, whole-virus vaccines over recombinant protein vaccines are that the conformation of the spike protein may be maintained and that antibodies to other viral proteins may contribute to protective immunity. Major disadvantages of inactivated, whole-virus vaccines would be the need to work with whole infectious virus in the preparation of the vaccine and the potential for incomplete inactivation in the processing and manufacturing of the vaccine.",

Not all vectors were equally immunogenic, and efficacy data were not available from all the studies. Nevertheless, those vectors that elicited neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity were those that expressed the spike protein of SARS-CoV. Vectors expressing other SARS-CoV proteins including M and N did not confer protection from challenge with SARS-CoV, and the addition of the M and N genes did not enhance the immunogenicity or efficacy or the vaccine encoding the spike protein alone (Buchholz et al., 2004). In senescent mice, immunization with a vectored vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV N protein alone, or with co-administered spike protein. Enhanced pathology was seen following challenge (Deming et al., 2006). A summary of the vectored vaccines tested, their immunogenicity and protective efficacy and the animal models in which they were tested are listed in Table 4. Of all the live-vectored vaccines tested to date, only one construct (MVA-S) was variably immunogenic and variably efficacious. In ferrets, vaccination with this vector did not confer protection and may have led to formation of hepatic lesions following challenge with SARS-CoV. These findings contrast with other data reported using a MVA-S-vectored vaccine in mice and rhesus macaques where they were significantly immunogenic and efficacious. It is possible that the immunogenicity of MVA-vectored vaccines, like DNA vaccines varies in different species.",

Enhanced disease associated with FIPV is not well understood but apparently is mediated by sub-neutralizing antibodies that facilitate viral entry into macrophages via an Fc-receptor-mediated mechanism (Corapi et al., 1992, Corapi et al., 1995, Hohdatsu et al., 1991, Hohdatsu et al., 1993, Olsen et al., 1992, Olsen et al., 1993). In the absence of serotype-specific protective antibodies or in the presence of low levels or sub-neutralizing levels of virus specific antibody, other human viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and dengue virus demonstrate enhanced disease upon re-infection (Connors et al., 1992a, Connors et al., 1992b, Halstead, 2003, Kakuk et al., 1993, Murphy et al., 1990, Sullivan, 2001). Disease enhancement in cases of RSV occurs in the absence of protective titers of antibodies and is likely mediated by cellular immune responses that lead to immunopathology. Antibody dependent entry observed in dengue virus infections is similar to that which occurs in FIPV infection. In dengue virus infections, antibody enhanced entry occurs after previously infected individuals are re-infected with a second serotype of dengue virus. The antibodies to the first serotype of dengue virus are not protective against the second serotype, and virus entry into susceptible cells is facilitated through Fc-receptor-mediated mechanisms by these non-protective antibodies.",

Enhancement has only been demonstrated at the level of virus entry and not in virus replication, and it is yet to be determined if enhanced replication occurs in the presence of sub-neutralizing levels of antibodies. Furthermore, these in vitro findings have not been linked to any known component of human disease or infection in vivo in animal models; this phenomenon has only been reported with pseudo-typed viruses and has not been observed with human isolates of SARS-CoV; and these observations in 786-O cells were not reproducible according to He et al.

Furthermore, enhanced disease has not been reported in respiratory tissues or in GI tissues, which are the primary sites of viral replication in SARS-CoV infection. In a single set of experiments (Weingartl et al., 2004a), ferrets were immunized with MVA-SARS-S via interperitoneal and subcutaneous routes with 108\n pfu of vaccine per ferret at day 0, boosted with the same regimen at day 14, and challenged intranasally with 106\n pfu/ferret of SARS-CoV (Tor2) at day 28. MVA-SARS-S vaccinated ferrets demonstrated low levels of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV 1 week after the booster immunization (i.e. day 21; titer 1:40 or less). Strangely, neutralizing antibodies in this group were not detectable at day 28 (<1:20), prior to challenge and no significant difference was observed in the level of virus detected in pharyngeal swabs from animals vaccinated with MVA-SARS-S and control animals following challenge with SARS-CoV. Foci of hepatic necrosis were observed in MVA-SARS-S-vaccinated animals and to a lesser extent, in animals immunized with the MVA vector alone or PBS. It is unclear why the MVA-SARS-S vaccine was so poorly immunogenic (indicated by low level and transient detection of neutralizing antibodies) in ferrets since a similar vaccine was immunogenic and efficacious in mice and NHPs. It is also unclear why a memory antibody response was observed in MVA-SARS-S-immunized animals but was unable to neutralize virus or clear virus from these ferrets any faster than virus was cleared from mock-immunized ferrets. The possibility of co-pathogens as a cause for hepatitis was not examined, and it is possible that co-pathogens might have played a role in the observations reported in these ferrets. It is also possible that the observed phenomenon may be limited to a specific vector (MVA) or animal model (ferrets). Finally, although elevated levels of liver enzymes following SARS-CoV infection have been reported in human cases of SARS, hepatitis was rarely if ever reported in SARS patients (Z. Yang et al., 2005). Therefore, it is difficult to interpret the findings of hepatitis in ferrets and to determine if these findings have any relevance to the possibility of disease enhancement in SARS-vaccinated animals. Although unconfirmed, it may be possible that hepatic lesions observed in this study occur through cell-mediated mechanisms similar to that observed in the lungs in RSV infection following the use of a formalin inactivated vaccine. The finding of hepatitis following use of this MVA-vectored vaccine in ferrets merits further evaluation.",
