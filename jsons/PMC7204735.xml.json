            "text": "Relevant studies have shown that progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and their derivatives (goitrin and epigoitrin) are the main glucosinolates in R. isatidis; these chemical constituents reportedly exhibit many biological activities, including antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects [[5], [6], [7]]. In addition, progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, goitrin, and epigoitrin account for 34%, 60%, 3%, and 1.8% of total glucosinolates, respectively [8]. Epiprogoitrin and progoitrin are converted to corresponding aglycones and other degradation products (epigoitrin/goitrin) by enzymatic hydrolysis through myrosinase in plants or enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract, and this the main biosynthetic pathway of goitrin and epigoitrin [9]. Moreover, epiprogoitrin and progoitrin bear a chiral carbon at C-3 as part of their structural skeleton, forming a pair of optical epimers, namely progoitrin (R-progoitrin) and epiprogoitrin (S-progoitrin), respectively (Fig. 1\nA, B). Although the mechanisms underlying these stereoselective functions remain unclear, numerous studies have demonstrated that such epimers [20(S)-ginsenoside Rg3 and 20(R)-ginsenoside Rg3 in Panax notoginseng] exhibit various stereoselective activities, such as effects on the cardiovascular [10] and immune system [11], and antitumor [12,13] and antidiabetic activities [14]. These findings suggest that the stereostructure of the alkane chains is responsible for different pharmacokinetic characteristics and even diverse metabolism patterns after administration.",

In addition, Shi et al. reported an optimized efficient method of HPLC-UV-CD to simultaneously separate and quantify the four main chiral glucosinolates: progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, and R,S-goitrin in crude drugs, decoction pieces, and granules of R. Isatidis [15]. Recently, a fast, selective, and sensitive LC\u2013MS/MS method coupled with acetonitrile-mediated protein precipitation was recently introduced for detecting (R, S)-goitrin in rat plasma [16]. However, to date, no method for the quantification of progoitrin or epiprogoitrin in biological samples has been reported; information on the pharmacokinetics of glucosinolates in R. isatidis, particularly progoitrin and epiprogoitrin, is insufficient; consequently, no study has yet performed a systematic comparison of the pharmacokinetics of progoitrin and epiprogoitrin. These obstacles have thus hindered their application.",

            "text": "Furthermore, the epimers may undergo directional chiral inversion relative to each other in vivo, which may also be one of the reasons for distinct pharmacokinetic profiles between epiprogoitrin and progoitrin. Oral bioavailability was measured by the following equation: F (%) = (AUCi.g. \u00d7 Dosei.v.)/(AUCi.v. \u00d7 Dosei.g.) \u00d7 100%. The significant difference in bioavailability is mainly due to the difference of AUC after i.v. administration. Because the AUCi.g. values of epiprogoitrin and progoitrin have not significant difference. We have repeated the pharmacokinetic study of epiprogoitrin and progoitrin after i.v. administration, and the results are similar. Therefore, the differences in bioavailability are associated with the AUCi.v. values. And to date, the possible reason of the differences in AUCi.v. values may be the structure of analytes. However, chiral inversion has not yet been reported because these analytes have a similar molecular structure and polarity and the same molecular weight and MS fragments. It is thus challenging to separate them through UHPLC, which is generally used in pharmacokinetic studies with short chromatographic cycles.",

The results facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of these two glucosinolate epimers in vivo and highlight pharmacokinetic differences between them that have not yet been reported. After oral administration, progoitrin and epiprogoitrin were rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and exhibited dose-independent pharmacokinetic behaviour. The oral bioavailability of epiprogoitrin and progoitrin was 7.7%\u20139.3% and 20.1%\u201334.1%, respectively. Furthermore, after i.v. administration, the pharmacokinetic parameters between epiprogoitrin and progoitrin showed significant differences, which could be attributed to chiral inversion and membrane permeability. Further studies are warranted to validate our findings in the near future.",
