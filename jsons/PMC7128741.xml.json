Previous study findings have shown that dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) serves as the functional receptor for MERS-CoV.2 In view of the importance of DPP4 in regulating immune responses,3 inhibitors of DPP4 binding and activity could modulate the pathogenesis of viral infection and serve as potential therapeutics.",

Studies have provided new insights into DPP4 interaction with substrates and inhibitors, and numerous inhibitors with varying selectivity have been characterised in DPP4 binding and functional assays.4 Additionally, on the basis of our work on the use of DPP4 inhibitors as a treatment for autoimmune disease, DPP4 inhibition could suppress the damaging aspects of the body's own antiviral immune response by modulating inflammation.3 Reversible inhibitors of DPP4 enzymatic activity suppress T-cell proliferation and production of proinflammatory cytokines as well as interleukin 10.3 As we have shown, DPP4 inhibitor-mediated suppression acts partly through the induction of transforming growth factor \u03b2 1 (TGF\u03b21) production by effector T cells. Consistent with this mechanism, we noted a significant increase of TGF\u03b21 concentrations in tissue and plasma of mice treated with DPP4 inhibitors.3 TGF\u03b21 induction at the site of inflammation could be an additional therapeutic benefit of DPP4 inhibitor treatment, because TGF\u03b21 is an essential regulator of immune responses in severe respiratory infections.5 Notably, Carlson and colleagues5 reported that injection of TGF\u03b21 delayed mortality and reduced viral titres of mice infected with H5N1 influenza virus, whereas neutralisation of TGF\u03b21 during H5N1 and pandemic 2009 H1N1 infection had opposing effects.",
