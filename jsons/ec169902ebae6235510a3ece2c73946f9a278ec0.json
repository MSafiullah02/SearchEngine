These range from compartmental models represented by sets of differential equations [2, 3] to highly complex individual-based models which represent daily activities and connections of individuals via transmission networks [4] . Compartmental models can be easily solved, but they cannot model adaptive behaviors of individuals and complex interactions of different groups of populations during disease outbreaks. While individual-based models like EpiSims can capture the spread of diseases with high-fidelity, modeling large populations often resorts to supercomputers and makes it impractical for quick what-if analyses of interventions or treatments under different conditions.",

Therefore, Gryphon enables multiple rapid what-if analyses to be performed using singular or multiple interventions and allows the users to optimize their pandemic responses. Compared to recent efforts on equation-based infectious disease modeling [5, 6] , Gryphon can support more complex and intensive user interactions for both modeling and interventions at runtime. These include pausing the simulation and modifying parameters for a specific group during runtime, modifying the probability that a sick individual travels from his home city to any other city, and enforcing temporary travel restrictions.",

Many studies have been reported to study the local temporal development of the SARS epidemic in one or more countries [7, 8] , but deficiencies were still lying in those models because of their separate space and time methodology and the lack of stochastic process for local and global disease transmission. The goal of this study is to validate the stochastic modeling and simulation of Gryphon for both local and non-local disease transmission dynamics using the SARS epidemic data. Instead of estimating all parameters in the stochastic SEIR model, we focus on the basic reproductive rate R 0 , which is \"the average number of secondary cases caused by an infectious individual in a totally susceptible population\".",

The mixing of secondary groups at a location can be localized mixing or non-localizing mixing. Localized mixing refers to the manner in which members of all secondary groups at a location interact with one another.

Active behaviors of an agent are modeled by a set of decision rules such as movement patterns, condition-based behaviors caused by interventions and environmental changes.

According to the WHO data, there are only two infections in Hong Kong on February 15, 2003. Note that the two data series in Figure 1 are aligned to calculate the maximal cross-correlation coefficient between the simulated data and the WHO data. We can find that, for Figure 1 However, it is hard to find the proper value of R 0 only from Figure 1 . The reason is that cross-correlation coefficient only models the shape of two data series. As we can see from Figure 1 , it is difficult to tell whether pair (3.0, 0.7) is better than pair (3.5, 0.7) on modeling the spread of SARS in Hong Kong. One idea is to use accumulative case numbers as the second measurement to model the scale of the curves. Figure 2 describes the difference of simulated accumulative case# and actual accumulative case# for pairwise R 0 , where the value of R 0 is switched on 3/12 and 3/15, respectively. From Figure 2 , we find that the accumulative case number for (3.5, 0.7) is much closer to the WHO data based on the second global warning. The experimental results show that the combined two metrics, cross-correlation coefficient and cumulative case number, can effectively estimate R 0 values from temporal patterns in an observed epidemic.

In this experiment we seed two infections in Hong Kong on February 15, 2003 and we examine the disease outbreak in two Asian countries: Singapore and Japan. We assume that the probability that a sick individual with SARS travels is 0.5. Figure 3 shows the new case# of SARS in Singapore from the WHO data and the mean new case# of SARS from simulations. We can see that, based on the airline travel data and the probability that a sick individual travels, the stochastic simulation engine significantly underestimates the SARS outbreak in Singapore. The peak of the mean new case number is one for the first warning and two for the second warning. However, some specific simulations did capture the dynamics of the SARS outbreak in Singapore. Figure 4 describes the best matched epidemic curve in Singapore from stochastic simulations. The cross correlation coefficient between the best matched simulation data and the WHO data is around 0.6. This indicates that the spread of the SARS epidemic in Singapore is probably the worse case scenario predicted by stochastic simulations. Most likely the first few infections are super-spreaders (a super-spreader is a person having many contacts) and they transmit the disease to large numbers of people.",

            "text": "As shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 , the mean new case number predicted from the stochastic simulation engine can overestimate the SARS epidemic. On the other hand, the stochastic engine can also underestimate the SARS epidemic in some countries like Japan in 2003. The daily airline traffic (in 2005) between Hong Kong and Singapore is 38000 seats/per day, while the daily airline traffic between Hong Kong and Japan is 133000 seats/per day. Based on the traffic data as well as the potential of disease transmission from mainland China, the estimated SARS epidemic should be more severe in Japan than that in Singapore. Figure 5 shows the mean new case# of SARS in Japan generated by 100 rounds of simulations. The stochastic simulation engine predicts that there will be about 98 SARS cases for the first warning and 160 SARS cases for the second warning in Japan. This value is close to the mean total case number of SARS predicted by the continuoustime stochastic model published in [6] . However, there is no reported SARS case in Japan during the 2003 SARS outbreak. The actual scenarios in Singapore and Japan motivate us to rethink more complex processes of the spatial and temporal transmission as well as different modes of transmission. These include but not limited to the role of the super-spreader and the heterogeneous mixing among different social groups. For example, Japanese tourists may not well mix with the Chinese community in both Hong Kong and mainland China. The high standard of hygiene conditions in Japan may also prevent the spread of SARS.",

We studied the effectiveness of Gryphon, an agent-based stochastic simulation engine for infectious diseases using the historic SARS data. The estimated pairwise value of R 0 for Hong Kong is consistent with [10] by assuming an exponential increase in the number of cases over time, while the predicated total case number for non-local disease transmission is close to the one given in [6] , in which Hufnagel et al. used a continuous-time stochastic SEIR model. The experimental results suggest that the expected numbers of infections as well as the timeline of enforced control strategies predicted by our stochastic engine are in reasonably good agreement with previous approaches.",

The data-driven Gryphon will serve as a real-time epidemiological environment for pandemic preparedness and response planning.",

One simple way to model the transmission dynamics and control strategies is to change the basic reproductive rate R 0 . Therefore, instead of using one value for R 0 , we have a pairwise value (R H , R L ) for R 0 to reflect the level of effectiveness of control strategies after WHO warnings. The value of R 0 is switched from R H to R L in the experiments based upon one of the WHO global alerts. The range of R H is {2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5} and the range of R L is {0.6, 0.7, 0.8}.",
