Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) is an enveloped non-segmented, negative, single-stranded RNA virus, which is classified as member of the genus Respirovirus of the family Paramyxoviridae (Henrickson, 2003). HPIV-3 infection in immunocompetent adults usually courses as mild and self-limited. However, HPIV-3 is the second cause of viral lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in young children, only preceded by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Counihan et al., 2001, Henrickson, 2003, Iwane et al., 2004). Children under 5 years of age, immunocompromised individuals and the elderly are at high risk for severe or even fatal infection (Falsey, 2012, Henrickson, 2003, Liu et al., 2013, Reed et al., 1997).",

In most severe cases the administration of ribavirin has been reported, but its efficacy and benefits have not still been demonstrated (Falsey, 2012). Regarding prophylaxis, two chimeric bovine/human PIV-3 vaccines based on haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) proteins were found to be well tolerated and immunogenic (Karron et al., 2012, Schmidt et al., 2011), but remained under study in clinical trials. HPIV-3, like other RNA viruses, has the capability to acquire random point mutations throughout its genome, mainly in the envelope glycoproteins (HN and F) that are under the selective pressure from human immune response. The rate of molecular evolution of HPIV-3 based on HN protein was estimated at 1.10 \u00d7 10\u22123 substitutions per site per year, similar to that of other virus genes such as the G gene of respiratory syncytial virus (Mizuta et al., 2014). The pattern of HPIV-3 evolution, based on the analysis of F gene sequences, it is quite similar to influenza virus B (Prinoski et al., 1992). Since the rest of the genome remains highly conserved, the non-coding region of F gene and the coding region of HN gene are often used to perform molecular epidemiological studies (Almajhdi, 2015, C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 1987, Mao et al., 2012, Prinoski et al., 1992, Storey et al., 1987).",

All characterized HN (94/102) and F (97/102) sequences in the present study fell within C1b (11), C5 (3) and in other two closely C3a-related clusters (C3a1, 44; C3a2, 10), with bootstrap values higher than 80%. In addition, other 29 sequences clustered together within subgroup C with a 100% bootstrap value and a genetic distance (nucleotide differences per site) within group of 0.004. However, this genetic group showed a nucleotide divergence of 0.019 and 0.024 among C1a and C1b, respectively. According to Almajhdi (2015) this might be considered a new lineage, and was named in the present study as C1c following the current nomenclature (Almajhdi, 2015, Mao et al., 2012). A complete correspondence between the HN and F phylogenetic classifications was also observed. During the study period, viral variants belonging to different lineages were cocirculating, but showing variable rates among seasons (Supplementary Fig. 1). Sequences from five laboratory-confirmed specimens were partial or could not be obtained, due to the non-availability of the clinical sample for the sequencing, the low quality of the extracted NA, or the low viral load in the respiratory specimen.",

            "text": "The HPIV-3 co-infection rate (6.9%) with other respiratory viruses was similar to previous studies (5\u201327%) (Cilla et al., 2008, Pierangeli et al., 2007). Some studies also identified RV, as well as human coronavirus, as the most frequently detected viruses in co-detection with HPIV-3 (Mao et al., 2012). This finding is congruent because RV was one of the most prevalent respiratory viruses with a prolonged excretion period within the period of study in our hospital (data not shown), together with RSV and influenza viruses, that are the cause of seasonal epidemics every year. However, the HPIV-3 co-detection with RSV or with influenza viruses in the present study might not be surely well-represented, because these epidemic viruses are mostly detected by using point-of-care tests during the annual epidemics, and no further microbiological studies are usually performed to detect additional respiratory viruses. Nevertheless, a large number of co-detections should not be expected because, unlike RSV and influenza viruses that circulate during winter months, HPIV-3 usually did during the spring and summer months (inter-seasonal period), as previously described (Henrickson, 2003, Liu et al., 2013). These results also highlight the importance of the surveillance or detection of other respiratory viruses different from RSV and influenza viruses during the inter-seasonal period, particularly in patients with high risk of severe HPIV-3 infection.",

Nucleotide sequences analyzed in comparison with different international strains demonstrated an association with some Chinese strains (C3a) (Mao et al., 2012) and Saudi Arabia strains (C1b and C5) (Almajhdi, 2015, Almajhdi et al., 2012), whereas no association with strains from America (Elango et al., 1986, van Wyke Coelingh et al., 1988), India (unpublished) or Australia (Lawrence et al., 2004, van Wyke Coelingh et al., 1988) was observed. In addition, a new lineage (C1c) was first described in the present study.

Therefore, partial F gene sequencing might be used much more often for epidemiological studies than complete HN sequence, because the process by using a single PCR product is quite streamlined. Nevertheless, complete sequencing of the HN coding region, instead of the partial F gene, would be preferable to detect amino acid substitutions that might be related to changes in the functionality and antigenicity of the protein (Almajhdi, 2015, Almajhdi et al., 2012, Mao et al., 2012). Some amino acid substitutions within characterized antigenic sites were found in some strains. However, to acquire a better understanding of the importance of these mutations, further studies on the catalytic activities and antigenicity of the HPIV-3 HN protein are needed. In addition, recent knowledge about the genetic and antigenic features of current circulating strains should be relevant for vaccine development, and it is therefore advisable to carry out a continuous viral surveillance to have an updated information.",
