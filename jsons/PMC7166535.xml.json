After 24 h, antibody levels in the dam's milk decrease rapidly, and IgG levels in serum cease to rise.25 We also suggest that maternal antibodies might not have been sufficient to mediate protective immunity for them. Animals would then be exposed to new MERS\u2010CoV infection and specific antibodies would consequently increase in 1\u20132 years after, which can explain the higher seroprevalence in juveniles then in adults. The predominance of viral antibodies in young camels could also be explained by animal exposure to the virus few times post\u2010parturition and not by mother immunity, which will stimulate antibody secretion in the blood. In the two last possibilities, young camels could contract viral infection after 2012, period of epidemic MERS circulation in KSA, and production of specific antibodies would consequently increase in some months after birth. Respiratory specimens, as nasal swabs, and rectal swabs will be required for analysis to know whether anti\u2010MERS antibodies are issued from recent viral infection.",
