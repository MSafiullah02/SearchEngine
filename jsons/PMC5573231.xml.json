The most recent updates issued by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) list <10,000 viruses that have been classified in <3,000 species [2, 3, 6, 7, 30]. The development and increasing adoption of metagenomic approaches in recent years have revealed that current measurements of global viral diversity are vast underestimates [8, 13]. For the foreseeable future, virus taxonomy will have to be revised continuously and sometimes substantially as new discoveries are made that challenge current taxonomic thinking [38]. Objective techniques, such as viral genome sequence-based alignments and comparison algorithms, and automatic tools (in silico taxonomy decision trees) are used increasingly for virus classification to circumvent virus culture bias (i.e., the acceptance and classification of only that minority of viruses that can be grown in the laboratory). Updating existing taxonomies is crucial for classification to become database-compliant and user-friendly, while not violating the Rules of the International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN), which also are updated continuously [4, 5, 30].",

The reason for this complexity is in part because these viruses were discovered before the advent of modern molecular biological techniques. The isolation of EAV, the causative agent of equine viral arteritis, was reported in 1957 [15]; the isolation of LDV, which can cause disease in laboratory mice, was reported in 1963 [44]; and the isolation of SHFV, which causes simian hemorrhagic fever in Asian macaques, was reported in 1968 [52]. Even the isolation of PRRSV, the etiological agent of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, in 1991 [57] (European/Lelystad \u201cstrain\u201d or \u201ctype 1\u201d) and 1992 [12, 19] (North American \u201cstrain\u201d or \u201ctype 2\u201d) predates the availability of routine genome sequencing. Consequently, initial classification of these viruses relied primarily on morphological features of their virions (Fig. 1), with subsequent reclassifications based on nucleotide sequences of genome fragments or, eventually, coding-complete or complete genomes generated from viruses isolated in vitro.\n",

            "text": "None of these four arteriviruses were mentioned in the First Report (1971) of the International Committee on Nomenclature of Viruses (ICNV), the predecessor of the ICTV [58]. In the Second ICTV Report (1976), EAV and LDV were considered related due to their similar protein composition [59] and listed as unclassified members of the family Togaviridae because of the similarity of their virions to those of classified togaviruses [26]. SHFV joined this group of unclassified togaviruses in the Third (1979) and Fourth (1982) Reports [39, 40]. During subsequent years, the family Togaviridae was reorganized thoroughly. As a consequence, the genus Arterivirus was established and included in the family Togaviridae as a taxonomic home for EAV. LDV was considered a second member of this genus, and SHFV was removed from the family Togaviridae and placed into a group with hepatitis C virus in the newly established family Flaviviridae [51, 56]. However, the Fifth Report failed to take into account that EAV replication occurs via a 5\u2032-3\u2032-coterminal set of nested subgenomic mRNAs, a strategy not used by togaviruses or flaviviruses, but is characteristic of coronaviruses [20, 21, 28, 48]. Subsequent genomic studies confirmed the relatedness of EAV, LDV, PRRSV, and SHFV. Therefore, in the ICTV\u2019s Sixth Report (1995), all four viruses were assigned to a free-floating genus Arterivirus [18]. The ICTV\u2019s Seventh Report (2000) formalized the relationship of arteriviruses and coronaviruses by including the genus Arterivirus in a new family, Arteriviridae, and by including this family and the family Coronaviridae in a new order, Nidovirales. EAV, LDV, PRSSV, and SHFV were assigned as single members to the four arteriviral species Equine arteritis virus, Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus, and Simian hemorrhagic fever virus, respectively [14, 23]. This taxonomy was upheld in the ICTV\u2019s Eight (2005) and Ninth Reports (2011) and is still valid at the time of writing [24, 46]. A summary of this arterivirus taxonomy is given in Table 1.\n",

Results of a recent study identified two novel simian arteriviruses, Pebjah virus (PBJV) and simian hemorrhagic encephalitis virus (SHEV), as etiological agents of historical simian hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in Asian macaques, but their natural hosts remain unknown [37]. During yet unpublished studies, Drakensberg Mountain vervet virus 1 (DMVV-1) and Kafue kinda-chacma baboon virus 1 (KKCBV-1) were discovered in vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus Cuvier, 1821) and Kinda baboons (Papio kindae L\u00f6nnberg, 1919) in South Africa and Zambia, respectively. Finally, a novel simian arterivirus was found in a DeBrazza\u2019s monkey (Cercopithecus neglectus Schlegel, 1876) in Cameroon and its sequence was deposited in GenBank (Ng et al., unpublished).",

In 2012, Dunowska et al. published the partial genome of a novel arterivirus-like pathogen, wobbly possum disease virus (WPDV), found in common brushtails (Diprodontia: Phalangeridae: Trichosurus vulpecula Kerr, 1972), a marsupial introduced to New Zealand [22]. The complete genomic sequences of WPDV were deposited in GenBank [unpublished data], and the virus was isolated in tissue culture in 2015 [27]. Both the virus from the forest giant pouched rat and WPDV genomes contain all arterivirus-defining elements described above, and recent electron-microscopic studies revealed that the WPDV particles assume the typical arterivirion shape (spherical to icosahedral particles) [22, 27]. However, the WPDV genome sequence is highly divergent from the genomes of classified arteriviruses [22, 47], and WPDV is the first arterivirus found in a non-eutherian host.",

The replicase ORFs 1a and 1b encoding replicase precursor polyproteins pp1a/pp1ab are followed by genes encoding envelope (E) protein, glycoproteins (GP2b-GP5), membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid protein (N) (5\u2032-1a/1b-2a-2b-3-4-5a-5-6-7-3\u2032), which justifies their grouping (Fig. 2).

These analyses are based on the similarity of the ORF1b nucleotide sequences or the encoded pp1b amino acid sequences and/or on homologous and alignable portions of coding-complete viral genomes (thus excluding the additional 4 SHFV ORFs) [36, 47]; and\nhost range.

However, the pairwise genetic distances of the twelve simian arteriviruses are less than 50 % identical to each other on the nucleotide level. Such genetic distances are similar to the distance observed between the genomes of PRRSVs and LDV, PRSSVs and EAV, or LDV and EAV, all of which are currently classified members of separate species.

The PASC analysis aligns nucleotides in conserved protein or nucleotide regions of each virus pair. The resulting histograms visualize the distribution of the number of virus pairs at each identity percentage. A typical histogram has peaks that represent different taxon levels. The percentages of the lowest points of the valleys between the peaks can be used as taxon demarcation criteria. The results of the arterivirus PASC analysis are shown in Figure 5 (updates can be accessed at the NCBI website at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/pasc/viridty.cgi?textpage=overview). Results from PASC indicate that the most appropriate genus cut-off for arteriviruses is 39\u201341 %. The most appropriate species cut-off would be 71\u201377 %, which is close to species cutoffs set for other viral families. These cut-offs result in a split of the current genus Arterivirus into 5 genera, a split of the current species Porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus into two species (one for \u201cEuropean/Lelystad\u201d PRRSV type 1 and one for \u201cNorth American\u201d PRRSV type 2), and the split of the species Simian hemorrhagic fever virus into ten species.\n",

Accordingly, the current genus Arterivirus is replaced with five genera: Dipartevirus (sigil of the mammalian order Diprotodontia + arterivirus) for WPDV; Equartevirus (sigil of the mammalian family Equidae + arterivirus) for EAV; Nesartevirus (sigil of the mammalian family Nesomyidae + arterivirus) for the forest giant pouched rat virus; Rodartevirus (sigil of the mammalian families Rodentia and Artiodactyla + arterivirus) for LDV and PRRSV; and Simartevirus (sigil of the mammalian infraorder Simiiformes + arterivirus) for all simian arteriviruses. These genus names were consciously selected to\nnot contain numbers or references to Greek letters or Arabic numbers (e.g., \u201cAlphaarterivirus, Betaarterivirus\u201d or \u201cArterivirus 1,\u201d Arterivirus 2\u201d) for ease of memorization and use in vernacular writing and oral communication. Future establishment of new genera in the family will not be hampered by the length of the Greek alphabet or by the addition of large numbers. In addition, by not choosing such names, the visually unpleasing double vowels aa (Alph\naa\nrterivirus, Bet\naa\nrterivirus etc.), which formally would require diareses, are avoided;not contain the complete word stems of hosts or geographic locations. This way, the genus names should remain uncontroversial even if members of the genus are discovered in areas or hosts divergent from the founding members;contain mnemonics for easier memorization. For instance, the genus name Equ\nartevirus will be easier to remember for equine arteritis virus than, for instance, Alphaarterivirus or Arterivirus 1. But as the three letters \u201cEqu\u201d do not convey the same meaning as \u201cequine\u201d to the casual reader, additional genus members, not stemming from equids, can be included without making the genus name misleading;not contain complete word stems of higher taxa (e.g., \u201carteri\u201d or \u201cnido\u201d) but to again use contractions (\u201carte\u201d). This choice will allow adherence to the ICVCN \u201cstability rule\u201d: i.e., the chosen genus names could be retained even if future taxonomic reorganizations would require the dissolution of the family Arteriviridae or the order Nidovirales, or if individual genera would have to be moved to separate families.\n",

Nonstructural protein 2 transframe (nsp2TF) is produced through a \u201c-2\u201d programmed ribosomal frameshift by most, but not all, arteriviruses. The remaining ORFs are translated from subgenomic RNAs. Purple ORFs (four shades) encode minor structural proteins (envelope protein E, glycoproteins 2b, 3 and 4); blue ORFs (three shades) encode the major structural proteins GP5 (glycoprotein 5), M (matrix protein), and N (nucleocapsid protein). Red ORFs (four shades), present only in simian arterivirus (simartevirus) genomes, encode minor structural proteins of unknown function (see also Fig. 1B).
