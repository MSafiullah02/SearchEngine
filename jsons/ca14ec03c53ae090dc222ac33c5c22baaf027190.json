Urologic surgical residents around the nation are faced with the unknown when they walk through the doors of the hospital each day. While experience has taught us navigational strategies to handle these circumstances, the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly brought new meaning to this concept. Priorities have quickly transitioned from closely following our previously developed academic curriculum and enhancing our surgical skills, to limiting physician-patient encounters and ensuring the safety and health of our team. Normalcy within our professional and personal lives is completely lost. Yet, as health care providers, we must and will forge on. We review the techniques and guidelines that our institution has implemented in order to allow us to do just that.",

This plan emphasizes social and professional distancing, allows residents and faculty to stay current on academic topics, and provides reasonable opportunities for personal wellness, all while emphasizing safety and rationalization. Most importantly, however, we have continued to provide our patients with exceptional urologic care at 2 adult hospitals and 1 children's hospital in the Greater Akron, Ohio area. While we understand each residency program has a unique curriculum with a different number of residents that cover a range of different hospitals, we hope to provide insight into our personal experience. We believe that this method of organization allows a residency program to continue to grow professionally, socially, academically, and personally during the uncertainty that is COVID-19. This framework could serve as an immediate action plan for future pandemics and natural disasters, especially for residency programs that cover multiple hospitals and health care settings.",

During this time, we believe that it is essential to limit our exposure to healthcare settings and to patients for multiple reasons. Early estimates state that social distancing can reduce COVID-19 transmission by as much as 60%. 1 Although it is our goal as health care providers to have patients' best intentions in mind, we can inadvertently serve as vectors of disease transmission between our patients, our team members, and even our loved ones during this time. The literature has recently suggested that hospitals are likely to blame for the highest rates of COVID-19 transmission, while other sources have established that health care workers on various teams are at a higher risk for becoming infected with the virus. 1,2 With the growing number of new cases and deaths on a daily basis, our team must be healthy and reserves must be prepared to continue to perform surgery and provide excellent urologic care. This mindset has been reflected in our program's effort to limit our coverage at our assigned hospitals, thus limiting opportunities for disease transmission.",

This individual is on call all day and all night from the comfort of their home if possible. That resident will cover the \"highpriority\" scheduled surgical cases that are scheduled at the hospital along with floorwork. An effort is made to ensure that each junior, mid-level, and senior resident have an equal number of call days over the course of the month with appropriate time off in between, all while adhering to the unchanged Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's (ACGME) 80hour work week laws for medical residents. 3 Only emergent consults should be seen by the juniorlevel resident in order to limit patient interaction and the potential spread of COVID-19. A call is made to the primary team in order to discuss the goals and necessity of each consult. A decision is made as to whether or not the patient can be seen as an outpatient via virtual visit, or whether they need to be seen in person in the hospital. Virtual methods can be used such as Facetime in order to perform limited physical examination if needed. One senior resident is designated as the \"backup\" point of contact and is in the hospital during the day to help with major cases (high priority robotic procedures). That resident is then free to leave the hospital after the completion of these procedures. They are the point of contact if there are any questions from the junior-level resident throughout the rest of the day and evening. One senior resident is to cover the children's hospital via home call. Quickly following the declaration of a pandemic, a decision was made for the pediatric urology department to cancel all elective surgeries and nonessential office visits. Therefore, the pediatric urology resident on call is to cover any urgent evaluations in the Emergency Room. Any nonurgent consults are to be discussed with the pediatric urology attending on call prior to evaluation in person.",

Our program's senior residents and staff arrive at a collective decision as to whether or not the consult must be seen urgently in the hospital, or if it can be addressed in the outpatient setting. Recommendations are made to the primary team if the consult is deemed nonurgent, and the patient is instructed to follow up outpatient via virtual visit.

Within the medical field, many changes are already taking shape. For example, telemedicine and virtual visits have become the primary and safest forms of outpatient clinical care for all of our program's attending physicians. A recent article by Forbes highlighted the substantial uptick in telehealth popularity, with increased rates of usage ranging from 257% to 700% over a variety of platforms since the COVID-19 outbreak. 5 While telemedicine has been around for a few decades, the current situation may serve as the future gold standard for outpatient care. Telemedicine within the field of urology is not commonplace compared to other specialties, but has been suggested in the effort to improve value-based urologic care. 6 Our program has traditionally consisted of a weekly in-person clinic requirement as part of our patient care curriculum, however, virtual visits may soon assume this role as the pandemic progresses toward its national peak.",
