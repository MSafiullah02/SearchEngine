            "text": "Smart e-learning refers to a new paradigm of online education informatization, based on educational data, to integrate modern education theory with supporting technologies to achieve better performance of intelligent e-learning services. We can observe it from two different viewpoints. From the viewpoint of data-driven services, smart e-learning is a three-tier architecture, involving data level, supporting technology level, and service level. According to traditional data category, educational data can be classified into three classes: structured educational data, semi-structured educational data, and unstructured data. Major supporting technologies include e-learner profiling, knowledge graph (KG) construction, learning path generation and navigation, etc. Typical services of e-learning focus on intelligent pedagogical tutoring, personalized recommendation, question/answering (Q/A), and education quality assessment (EQA). From another viewpoint, big data analytics of e-learning (BDAeL) has five kinds of tasks: descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, and continuous analytics. In smart e-learning, descriptive analytics aims to describe, summarize, and analyse historical and educational data and carry out typical tasks that include e-learner profiling [2] and KG construction [5] . Diagnostic analytics is to identify causes of learning trends and outcomes of e-learners, while continuous analytics is to monitor the status of e-learners and resource utilization, decide, and act autonomously or semi-autonomously. Both of their analysis results support services of Q/A, intelligent tutoring, and EQA. Predictive analytics aims to predict future outcomes based on the past, the typical task of which is academic performance prediction [3] . Prescriptive analytics aims to recommend right or optimal actions or decisions, and the typical tasks are personalized recommendation, Q/A, and intelligent tutoring, EQA. Some major supporting technologies and services are summarized as follows. e-Learner profiling Accurate e-learner profiling means how to effectively use the personal information and history (dynamic) data of learners to build e-learner profiles, which includes e-learners grouping, outlier analysis, social network analysis, academic performance and at-risk student prediction [3] , etc. This technology provides the data basis and e-learner characterization for services of EQA, personalized learning and intelligent tutoring, etc.",
