The literature suggests that computer based simulation is at least as effective as text-based learning. One LOE I study of good quality (Schwid, 1999 821) compared computer-based simulation refreshers following an advanced life support course to printed material and found significantly improved performance on a Megacode test for the computer simulation group. In one further LOE 1 study of fair quality (Kim, 2002, 395) text-based learning and a computer-based learning of arrhythmias produced similar learning outcomes. In this study the immediate learning outcomes favoured the textbook method of instruction but this difference was not apparent at one week after the training (this could have been a type II error as the mean score of the textbook group was higher but not statistically significantly different). It is important to note that the 'one size fits all' approach to resuscitation instruction may actually not be appropriate as experience may play an important role in knowledge and skills retention, at least for trauma resuscitation (Ali, 2002, 142) .",
