One of these drugs is 5 of 45 bleomycin, an anti-tumor antibiotic that interacts with oxygen and transition metals to cause double-stranded DNA breaks (Chen and Stubbe 2005) . Although the cytotoxicity of bleomycin can reliably induce cell death in tumor cells, off-target effects can lead to a range of harmful consequences from mild gastrointestinal irritation to severe bleomycininduced pulmonary fibrosis (Blum, Carter, and Agre 1973) . The tradeoff between efficacy and toxicity varies across individuals, and understanding the genetic variants that affect bleomycin response might yield opportunities to broaden the therapeutic range (de Haas et al. 2008; Relling and Dervieux 2001) .",

            "text": "Bleomycin sensitivity has been shown to be heritable, suggesting that genetic markers can be used to predict bleomycin responses (Cloos et al. 1999) . Many studies have attempted to identify the genetic variant(s) that underlie bleomycin-response differences across cancer patients, and some have identified potential connections between the metabolic enzyme bleomycin hydrolase (BLMH) and patient outcomes. However, none of these studies established a causal connection between genetic differences in BLMH and variation in bleomycin responses (Alt\u00e9s et al. 2013; de Haas et al. 2008; Nuver et al. 2005; Lazo and Humphreys 1983; Gu et al. 2011) . The inability to identify a human genetic variant that causes differences in bleomycin responses might be attributed to limited sample sizes (Sham and Purcell 2014) , confounding environmental factors (Hunter 2005; Liu et al. 2013) , variation in drug regimens across patients (Low et al. 2013 ), or tumor complexity and progression (McClellan and King 2010; Dagogo-Jack and Shaw 2018) . However, the DNA-damage pathways that might be implicated in bleomycin responses are evolutionarily conserved across eukaryotes (Taylor and 6 of 45 Lehmann 1998). Therefore, studying bleomycin responses in a model organism with natural genetic variation can offer insights into how bleomycin response differs across individuals and can potentially be applied to the clinic .",

We performed linkage mapping to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that underlie bleomycin-response variation. We used nearisogenic lines to validate one QTL on chromosome V. Next, we created and tested 7 of 45 CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion alleles to investigate all six candidate genes in the QTL region. We identified a nematode-specific gene, H19N07.3, that underlies this QTL. Expression of this gene varies across the RIAIL panel. However, the gene does not contain a protein-coding variant, suggesting that gene expression differences might underlie the bleomycin-response variation between the N2 and CB4856 strains. 8 of 45",

Populations of each strain were passaged on 6 cm plates for four generations to amplify animal numbers and reduce the effects of starvation . Gravid adults were bleached for stage synchronization, and approximately 25 embryos from each strain were aliquoted into 96-well plates at a final volume of 50 \u00b5L of K medium (Boyd, Smith, and Freedman 2012) . The following day, arrested L1 larvae were fed 5 mg/mL HB101 bacterial lysate in K medium (Pennsylvania State University Shared Fermentation Facility, State College, PA; Garc\u00eda-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2017 ) and were grown for 48 hours at 20\u00ba with constant shaking. A large-particle flow cytometer (COPAS BIOSORT, Union Biometrica, Holliston, MA) was used to sort three L4 larvae into each well of a 96-well plate that contained 50 \u00b5L K medium plus HB101 lysate at 10 mg/mL, 50 \u00b5M kanamycin, and either 1% distilled water (control) or 1% distilled water and bleomycin (drug). The sorted 9 of 45 L4 larvae were grown and propagated for 96 hours at 20\u00ba with constant shaking. The population of parents and progeny were treated with sodium azide (50 mM in M9) and quantified by the BIOSORT for several fitness parameters, including brood size (n), animal length (time of flight, TOF), and optical density (extinction time, EXT). Figure S4 , Figure S5 , File S4). The function load_cross_obj(\"N2xCB4856cross_full\") was executed to load a cross object containing 13,003 SNPs that describe breakpoints in the RIAIL panel (out of the 195,565 high-quality SNPs at which genotypes were called). The genotypic data and residual phenotypic data (after control-condition regression) were merged into a cross object using the merge_pheno function with set = 2 to include strains with a reduced allele-frequency skew on chromosome I. The fsearch function was used to calculate logarithm of odds (LOD) scores for each marker and each trait as \u2212 ( (1 \u2212 2 )/2 (10)), where R is the Pearson correlation coefficient between RIAIL genotypes at the marker and trait values (Bloom et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2017; Evans et al. 2018; . A 5% genome-wide error rate was calculated by permuting phenotype and genotype data 1,000 times. Mappings were repeated iteratively, each time using the marker with the highest LOD score as a cofactor until no significant QTL were detected. The annotate_lods function was used to calculate the percent of variance in RIAIL phenotypes explained by each QTL and a 95% confidence interval 12 of 45 around each peak marker, defined by any marker on the same chromosome within a 1.5-LOD drop from the peak marker.

To determine the concentration of bleomycin that would maximize among-strain while minimizing withinstrain phenotypic variation, we used the HTA to perform a dose-response assay. We assessed bleomycin responses for four divergent strains (N2, CB4856, JU258, and DL238) across each of 26 HTA traits (File S1, Figure S2 ).

Deletions of four of these genes, C45B11.8, C45B11.6, srg-42, and cnc-10 did not impact bleomycin responses. Deletions in one gene, jmjd-5, showed increased bleomycin resistance in both parental backgrounds. However, we concluded that the QTL cannot be explained by differences in jmjd-5 after further analysis of allelereplacement strains and hemizygosity tests. Deletions in a gene with an expression difference, scb-1 (previously named H19N07.3), caused an increase in bleomycin 31 of 45 sensitivity in both the N2 and the CB4856 strains. Results from a reciprocal hemizygosity assay indicated that natural variation in scb-1 function caused differences in bleomycin responses between the N2 and CB4856 strains. Because loss-of-function alleles in scb-1 caused increased bleomycin sensitivity (Figure 4 ) and the RIAILs with lower scb-1 expression levels show increased bleomycin sensitivity (Figure 3) , natural variation in scb-1 expression might cause the bleomycin-response variation between the N2 and CB4856 strains.",

In each of these studies, drug-response QTL overlap between linkage mapping 32 of 45 and GWA, and variants in common between both mapping strain sets have been shown to underlie drug-response QTL. In the case of the bleomycin response, the linkagemapping QTL did not overlap with the QTL identified through GWA. Therefore, the variant that underlies the QTL likely is not present at an allele frequency above 5% in the panel of wild isolates used for the bleomycin GWA. Whether or not linkage mapping and GWA QTL overlap, the combination of both mapping strategies allows for the set of putative causal variants to be narrowed, highlighting the power of a model organism with multiple quantitative trait mapping strategies. Additionally, the dichotomy between linkage-mapping QTL and GWA QTL shows that both rare and common natural variants underlie bleomycin-response variation.",

Although scb-1 is not found outside of nematodes, its function might be conserved in other animals. Further elucidation of the role of scb-1 in bleomycin responses within C. elegans might identify which components of the drug mechanism vary across individuals. Eventually, these results could lead to a better understanding of how natural genetic variation across cancer patients causes variable bleomycin efficacy and toxicity in the clinic.

Additionally, the NILs with the N2 allele at the QTL introgressed into the CB4856 background displayed a significant increase in bleomycin sensitivity compared to the parental CB4856 strain (Figure S6, File S7). Taken together, the phenotypes of the reciprocal allele-replacement strains showed that the amino-acid change in JMJD-5 likely does not underlie bleomycin-response variation between the N2 and CB4856 strains, although deletion of this gene did cause resistance to bleomycin regardless of the genetic background. We performed a reciprocal hemizygosity assay to test if natural variation in jmjd-5 function affected bleomycin responses (Figure S10, Figure S11, Figure S12). The results of this assay supported the previously identified increase in bleomycin resistance of homozygous jmjd-5 deletions in both parental backgrounds (Figure S11, File S7, p < 0.05, Tukey HSD), which again might be caused by an increased sensitivity in the control condition(",

The H19N07.3 eQTL explains 45.70% of the variation in H19N07.3 expression among the RIAILs (Figure 3, File S13). Although this gene does not have a non-synonymous variant between the N2 and CB4856 strains, natural variation in gene expression could impact bleomycin responses. We created two independent CRISPR-Cas9 mediated deletion alleles of H19N07.3 in the N2 and the CB4856 backgrounds and measured the bleomycin responses of these 27 of 45 strains compared to the parental strains (Figure 4, File S3, File S7, Supplemental Information, Materials and Methods).
