Dead or attenuated organisms or purified products derived from them are generally used to produce various vaccines. Over the past decade, scientific advances in genetics, molecular biology, and plant biotechnology have improved the understanding of many infectious diseases and led to the development of vaccination programs. The most common method of administering vaccines is by injection but some are given by mouth or nasal spray. Though immunization is the safest method to combat the diseases worldwide but there are many constraints regarding its mode of production, distribution, delivery, cost, and lack of enough research. Hence it is desirable to look for an effectual and powerful yet cost effective, easy for storage and distribution yet safe method of immunization. It should also be readily acceptable to all sociocultural groups around the globe. Research underway is dedicated to solving these problems by finding ways to produce edible vaccines in the form of transgenic plants which have been investigated as an alternative means to produce and deliver vaccine.",

They seem to be a viable alternative especially for the poor and developing countries. They have come up as great boon in medicinal science for which biotechnologists should be given all credit. The concept of edible vaccines lies in converting the edible food into potential vaccines to prevent infectious diseases. It involves introduction of selected desired genes into plants and then inducing these altered plants to manufacture the encoded proteins. It has also found application in prevention of autoimmune diseases, birth control, cancer therapy, etc. Edible vaccines are currently being developed for a number of human and animal diseases. This new technology hopefully will contribute positively toward the global vaccine programs and have a dramatic impact on health care in developing countries.",

            "text": "Many people in developing countries do not have access to the vaccines they need, as the traditional vaccines are costly and require skilled medical people for administration and are less effective in inducing mucosal immune response. It was these needs which inspired Hiatt et al. (1989) who attempted to produce antibodies in plants which could serve the purpose of passive immunization. The first report of edible vaccine (a surface protein from Streptococcus) in tobacco, at 0.02 % of total leaf protein level, appeared in 1990 in the form of a patent application published under the international patent cooperation treaty. By conceiving the idea of edible vaccine Dr. Charles Arntzen tried to realize it (Arntzen 1997). In 1992, Arntzen and coworkers introduced the concept of transgenic plants as a production and delivery system for subunit vaccines in which edible tissues of transgenic crop plants were used (Mor et al. 1998). They found that this concept could overcome the limitations of traditional vaccines, thereby triggering the research on edible vaccine. In 1990s, Streptococcus mutans surface protein antigen A was expressed for the first time in tobacco. The same group also pioneered the field with work on hepatitis B and heat-labile toxin, B subunit in tobacco plants and potato tubers. In the same year, the successful expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in tobacco plants was also achieved (Mason et al. 1992). To prove that plant-derived HBsAg could stimulate mucosal immune responses via oral route, potato tubers were used as an expression system and were optimized to increase the accumulation of the protein in plant tubers (Richter et al. 2000).",

The report by collaborators from the University of Maryland in Baltimore, the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research in Ithaca, N.Y., and Tulane University in New Orleans appeared in the May issue of Nature Medicine. According to the then Director of NIAID \u201cEdible vaccines offer exciting possibilities for significantly reducing the burden of diseases like hepatitis and diarrhea, particularly in the developing world where storing and administering vaccines are often major problems,\u201d Mor et al. (1999) also discussed the rapid increase of research in the edible-vaccine field and pointed out that plants could be used to create multicomponent vaccines that can protect against several pathogens at once. This is an aspect of the edible-vaccine approach that further strengthens its impact. Later, in 2003 Sala and research group reported that proteins produced in these plants induced the mucosal immune response which was the main aim behind this concept.",

Transgenic tobacco is successfully engineered for the production of edible vaccines against hepatitis B antigen using \u2018s\u2019 gene of hepatitis B virus (HBV). The optimum level of recombinant protein was obtained in leaves and seeds. Since acute watery diarrhea is caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli and Vibrio cholerae that colonize the small intestine and produce one or more enterotoxin, an attempt was made toward the production of edible vaccine by expressing heat-labile enterotoxin (LT-B) in tobacco. Besides, antibodies against dental caries, expressed in tobacco, are already in preclinical human trials. Italian researchers have now developed an immunologically active, cost-efficient vaccine against human papilloma viruses (HPV). HPV are the causative agents for cervical cancer, and are also involved in skin, head, and neck tumors. Cervical cancer is one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths.",

Previously, NIAID supported in vitro and preclinical studies by John Clements and colleagues at Tulane University School of Medicine, in which 14 volunteers ate bite-sized pieces of raw potato that had been genetically engineered to produce part of the toxin secreted by E. coli causing diarrhea. The investigators periodically collected blood and stool samples from the volunteers to evaluate the vaccine\u2019s ability to stimulate both systemic and intestinal immune responses. Ten of the 11 volunteers (91 %) who ingested the transgenic potatoes had fourfold rise in serum antibodies at some point after immunization, and 6 of the 11 (55 %) also showed fourfold mount in intestinal antibodies. The potatoes were well tolerated and no one experienced serious adverse side effects.

In contrast, edible vaccines would enhance compliance, especially in children, and because of oral administration would eliminate the need for trained medical personnel. Their production is highly efficient and can be easily scaled up. For example, hepatitis B antigen required to vaccinate whole of China annually, could be grown on a 40-acre plot and all babies in the world each year on just 200 acres of land. They are cheaper, sidestepping demands for purification (single dose of hepatitis B vaccine would cost approximately 0.43 cents), grown locally using standard methods and do not require capital-intensive pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. Mass-indefinite production would also decrease dependence on foreign supply. Fear of contamination with animal viruses\u2014like the mad cow disease, which is a threat in vaccines manufactured from cultured mammalian cells, is eliminated as plant viruses do not infect humans.",

Concentrating the vaccine into a teaspoon of baby food may be more practical than administering it in a whole fruit.There is always possibility of sideeffects due to the interaction between the vaccine and the vehicle.People could ingest too much of the vaccine, which could be toxic, or too little, which could lead to disease outbreaks among populations believed to be immune.A concern with oral vaccines is the degradation of protein components in the stomach due to low pH and gastric enzymes. However, the degradation can be compensated by repeating the exposure of the antigen until immunological tolerance is accomplished (Mason et al. 2002).Potential risk of spreading the disease by edible vaccine delivery is a concern of many.

The T-DNA usually contains cancer-causing oncogenic genes and genes that synthesize opines which are excreted by infected crown gall cells and are a food source for bacterium. During the genetic manipulation, the Ti plasmid is engineered to carry the desired gene for vaccine and the virulent genes that cause tumor growth in plants are deleted. The transgene is integrated, expressed, and inherited in mendelian fashion. The whole plant can be then regenerated from individual transformed plant cell. It has been studied that genes are successfully expressed in experimental model plants and when given orally to animals, the extract of transgenic plant containing the antigen induced serum antibodies, thus can be used to produce the edible vaccine.",

This method is especially beneficial for those plants which can not be transformed by A. tumefaciens mediated gene transfer method. Selected DNA sequences are precipitated onto metal microparticles and bombarded with a particle gun at an accelerated speed in a partial vacuum against the plant tissue placed within the acceleration path. Microparticles penetrate the walls and release the exogenous DNA inside the cell where it will be integrated in the nuclear genome. Thus, this method effectively introduces DNA. The cells that take up the desired DNA, are identified through the use of a marker gene (in plants the use of GUS is most common), and then cultured to replicate the gene and possibly cloned. This method has various advantages including (1) thousands of particles are accelerated at the same time causing multiple hits resulting in transferring of genes into many cells simultaneously, (2) since intact cells can be used, the difficulties encountered with the use of protoplast are automatically circumvented, and (3) the method is universal in its application so that cell type, size, and shape or the presence/absence of cell wall do not significantly alter its effectiveness.",

All plant cells have chloroplasts that capture light energy from the sun to produce free energy through a process called photosynthesis. In chloroplast genetic engineering, the recombinant DNA plasmid is bound to small gold nanoparticles that are injected into the chloroplasts of the leaf using a gene gun as described above. This device uses high pressure to insert the plasmid coated particles into the cells. These plasmids contain multiple genes of importance such as the therapeutic gene, a marker gene (may or may not be for antibiotic resistance), a gene that enhances the translation of therapeutic gene and two targeting sequences that flank the foreign gene. The foreign genes are inserted through homologous recombination via flanking sequences at a precise and predetermined location in the organelle genome. The gene expression level in plastids is predominately determined by promoter and 5\u2032-untranslated regions (5\u2032-UTR elements) (Gruissem and Tonkyn 1993). Therefore, suitable 5\u2032-UTRs including a ribosomal binding site (RBS) are important elements of plastid expression vectors (Eibl et al. 1999). In order to obtain high-level protein accumulation from expression of the transgene, the first requirement is a strong promoter to ensure high levels of mRNA. Most laboratories use the strong plastid rRNA operon (rrn) promoter (Prrn).",

Type-I diabetes, also known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or juvenile-onset diabetes, primarily affects children and young adults and accounts for 5\u201310 % of the diagnosed diabetes in North America. Research by Ma and Hein (1995) at the University of Western Ontario showed that diabetes can be prevented in mice by feeding them with plants engineered to produce a diabetes related-protein. The idea is based on \u2018oral tolerance\u2019 where the autoimmune system is selectively turned off early by teaching the body to tolerate the \u201cantigenic proteins\u201d. The pancreatic protein, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) is linked to the onset of IDDM, and when injected into mice it is known to prevent diabetes.",

The results were intriguing, only 20 % of the prediabetic mice fed with transgenic plants developed the diabetes, while 70 % nontreated mice developed the disease. The treated mice also showed increased levels of IG1, an antibody associated with cytokines, which suppresses harmful immune responses. Thus, the antigen produced in plants appears to retain immunogenicity and prevent diabetes in an animal model. According to Canadian scientists, this is the first proof of principle for the use of edible vaccines in the treatment of the autoimmune diseases.",

In order to produce edible vaccine initial success in splicing HIV protein into CPMV has been achieved. Two HIV protein genes and CaMV as promoter were successfully injected into tomatoes with a needle, and the expressed protein was demonstrable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in different parts of the plant, including the ripe fruit, as well as in the second generation plants. Recently, spinach has been successfully inoculated for Tat protein expression cloned into TMV. Each gram of leaf tissue of spinach was shown to contain up to 300\u2013500 \u03bcg of Tat antigen. Mice fed with this spinach followed by DNA vaccinations resulted in higher antibody titers than the controls, with the levels peaking at 4 weeks post-vaccination.",

In 2000, Tacket and his team mates studied the human immune response to the Norwalk virus capsid protein expressed in potatoes. Overall, 95 % (19 out of 20 volunteers) developed some kind of immune response, although the antibody increase in some cases was modest. In same year, Pogrebnyak\u2019s lab developed an effective vaccine against the coronavirus which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Tomato and Tobacco plants are used for high expression of the coronavirus spike protein (S1). First, lyophilized tomato fruit was fed to mice and then boosting occurred with S1 protein expressed in tobacco roots; high IgG1 immune responses and significant IgG2a and IgG2b responses were observed in their sera. Research is also going in the direction to engineer the plants to produce a variety of functional monoclonal antibody (Ma et al. 2005).",

The variable dose per gram of potato was due to the tissue specificity of the promoter, therefore, that LT-B was expressed to a different degree in the different tissues of the potatoes. The potatoes in this study were ingested raw; however, subsequent studies have shown that transgenic potatoes expressing the B subunit of cholera toxin could be boiled for 3 min until the tissue becomes soft with loss of only about 50 % of the CT- B pentameric GM1-binding form. Serologic responses were also detected after vaccination. Totally 10 out of the 11 volunteers (91 %) who ingested transgenic potatoes developed IgG anti-LT and in half of them responses occurred after the first dose.

Possible delayed reactions not yet discovered may be the point of consideration. In addition to that, edible vaccines can be further improved for their oral immunogenicity by the use of specific adjuvant which can be applied either as a fusion to the candidate gene or as an independent gene. Some of the diseases to which edible vaccines have shown promising application may be elaborated in the veterinary as well as human spectrum.
