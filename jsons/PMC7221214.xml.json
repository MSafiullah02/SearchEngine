In contrast, we observed an increase in the frequency of activated CD38+ cTfh cells from day 3 post\u2010vaccination on and a further increase until day 7 and day 14, followed by a contraction thereafter, however, without completely reaching pre\u2010vaccination levels by day 28 (Figure 1b).

This polarisation was even more pronounced amongst activated cTfh cells (Figure 2b, Supplementary figure 3h\u2013j). Compared to day 0, the frequency of the cTfh1 cells was strongly increased by day 14 and day 28 of the immune response to YF\u201017D, whereas the frequency of cTfh17 cells and also CXCR3\u2212CCR6\u2212 cTfh2 cells were decreased within the activated CD38+ compartment of circulating T follicular helper cells (Figure 2b). Similarly, the frequency of the cTfh1 cells within ICOS+CD38+, ICOS+PD\u20101+ and PD\u20101+CD38+ cTfh cells was strongly increased on day 14 and day 28 after vaccination with YF\u201017D (Supplementary figure 3h\u2013j). To gain further insight into the functionality of the activated cTfh cell subsets, we performed intracellular cytokine staining of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) that had been restimulated with PMA and ionomycin (Figure 2c). Activated cTfh cells on day 14 post\u2010vaccination showed high frequencies of IFN\u03b3\u2010producing cTfh1 cells and lower frequencies of IFN\u03b3\u2010producing cTfh1\u201017 and cTfh2 cells after non\u2010specific re\u2010stimulation (Figure 2c). IL\u20104+ cells were found in the cTfh1 and cTfh2 cell subsets while IL\u201017 was produced by cTfh1\u201017 and cTfh17 cells (Figure 2c).

Although there were no significant changes in the absolute number of CD4+ T cells, nor in the frequency of memory CD4+ T cells, nor in the frequency of CXCR5\u2212 cTmem cells amongst CD4+ T cells in the blood of YF vaccinees at the investigated time points after vaccination (Supplementary figure 3a, b and e, Figure 3a), the absolute number of CXCR5\u2212 cTmem cells was slightly decreased on day 3 and slightly increased on day 14 and day 28 (Supplementary figure 3d). While the frequencies of total CXCR5\u2212 cTmem cells did not change significantly after YF vaccination, there was a strong transient increase in the frequency of activated CD38+CXCR5\u2212 cTmem cells (Figure 3b, Supplementary figure 3f). The frequency of CD38+CXCR5\u2212 cTmem cells was already increased on day 3 post\u2010vaccination, reaching its peak by day 14 and then declining to frequencies of activated cells comparable to pre\u2010vaccination levels by day 28 (Figure 3b). Coinciding with the peak of activation on day 14, polarisation of the CXCR5\u2212 cTmem cells was also altered (Figure 3c, Supplementary figure 3g). The frequency of circulating CXCR3+CCR6\u2212 Th1 cells was increased on day 14 and day 28 following YF vaccination (Figure 3c). This was at the expense of CXCR3\u2212CCR6+ Th17 cells, which were underrepresented on day 14 and day 28 compared to pre\u2010vaccination frequencies (Figure 3c). This tendency was also observed when CXCR5\u2212 cTmem cells were pre\u2010gated on CD38+ activated CXCR5\u2212 cTmem cells (Figure 3d). Activated CXCR5\u2212 cTmem cells were strongly polarised towards the cTh1 subtype on day 14, and this polarisation persisted until at least day 28 (Figure 3d). Along with the highest frequency of activated cTh1 cells on day 14, CXCR3\u2212CCR6\u2212 Th2 cells were decreased in frequency on day 14, and cTh17 cells were decreased in frequency on day 14 and to a lesser extent on day 28 after vaccination compared to day 0 (Figure 3d). Intracellular cytokine staining after non\u2010specific re\u2010stimulation revealed that IFN\u03b3 was mostly produced by the Th1 and the CXCR3+CCR6+ Th1\u201017 subset (Figure 3e). IL\u20104 was produced by Th2 cells, but also by a fraction of Th1 cells. IL\u201017\u2010producing cells were found within the Th1\u201017 and Th17 subsets. While IL\u201021\u2010 and IL\u20102\u2010producing cells were detected amongst all four subsets, the Th1 compartment contained the highest frequency of IL\u20102\u2010producing cells. Compared to CXCR5+ cTfh cells (Figure 2c), the frequencies of IL\u201021+ and IL\u20102+ cells were lower in the activated CXCR5\u2212 cTmem cell compartment.",

Absolute numbers of blood CXCR5\u2212 Treg cells were increased on day 14 (Supplementary figure 4a), whereas the frequency of CXCR5\u2212 Treg cells amongst all CD4+ T cells was significantly increased early on day 3 and day 7 post\u2010vaccination (Figure 4a). Along with the increase in absolute numbers, the frequency of CD38+ activated cTreg was strongly increased on day 14 post\u2010vaccination but not yet on day 7 (Figure 4b). Therefore, an increase in the frequency of activated CXCR5\u2212 cTmem and cTfh cells preceded the increase in the frequency of activated cTreg cells (Figures 1b, 3b and 4b). Absolute numbers of cTfr cells were slightly increased on day 28 after vaccination (Supplementary figure 4b) and frequencies did not change significantly during the immune response to YF\u201017D (Figure 4a). In contrast to CXCR5\u2212 Treg cells, the frequency of CD38\u2010expressing cTfr cells was similar at all time points investigated and did not increase in response to yellow fever vaccination (Figure 4c).",

Two HLA types (HLA\u2010DRB1*03:01 and DRB1*01:01) frequently represented in our cohort were chosen for generation of tetramers in combination with two pre\u2010validated YFV peptides for each HLA type. Antigen\u2010specific cells were determined by co\u2010staining with a BV421\u2010 and an APC\u2010labelled tetramer to prevent inclusion of unspecifically bound cells in the analysis. YFV\u2010specific CD4+ T cells reactive to peptides derived from the viral proteins Cap, NS3, Env and NS1 were detectable in the blood of vaccinees on day 14 after vaccination while almost no cells specific to the antigens tested could be seen on day 7 yet (Figure 5a). This is in accordance with previous publications that detected YFV\u2010specific cells by CD40L or tetramer staining 2 weeks after vaccination.\n21\n, \n26\n On day 28, the frequency of antigen\u2010specific cells decreased and only few of the cells could still be detected in peripheral blood (Figure 5a). Antigen\u2010specific CD4+ T cells were mostly CXCR5\u2212 cTmem cells with up to 20% CXCR5+ cTfh cells depending on the antigen investigated (Figure 5b). The vast majority of antigen\u2010specific CXCR5\u2212 cTmem and cTfh cells was activated and expressed CD38 on day 14 (Figure 5c). Analysis of the subset composition of antigen\u2010specific cells showed that Cap\u2010, Env\u2010 and NS1\u2010specific CD4+ T cells were largely of the cTh1 and cTfh1 subset, highlighting the role of these subsets in the antiviral immune response (Figure 5d and e). In contrast, NS3\u2010specific CXCR5\u2212 cTmem cells were also polarised into cTh2 cells (Figure 5d) and NS3\u2010specific cTfh cells were also polarised into cTfh2 and cTfh17 subsets (Figure 5e).",

Similar to CD8+ T cells, the total number of CD19+ B cells was decreased on day 3 and day 7 after yellow fever vaccination in the blood (Supplementary figure 5a).

Even though more than 95% of vaccinated people develop long\u2010lasting protective neutralising antibody titres as early as 10 days after vaccination, the titres amongst individuals vary.\n7\n, \n21\n In order to determine prognostic markers for the titre of neutralising antibodies present on day 28 after vaccination, we correlated the neutralising antibody titre with several Tfh cell populations on day 3, day 7, day 14 and day 28 after vaccination. The titre was determined as the dilution of sera which showed a 50% reduction of the focus count in a focus reduction neutralisation test (FRNT). While none of the frequencies of CXCR5\u2212 cTmem cells as well as none of the pre\u2010vaccination (0 dpv) frequencies of cTfh cell parameters correlated with the neutralising antibody titre (data not shown), we found that the frequencies of cTfh1 and cTfh17 cells correlated with the neutralising activity measured in the serum of vaccines (Figure 7a and b). cTfh1 cell frequencies on day 14 and day 28 correlated positively with the measured neutralising activity [higher effective dose (ED) of neutralising antibodies in the serum; Figure 7a]. This meant that in patients with higher frequencies of cTfh1 cells sera had to be diluted more, in order to decrease neutralising activity to 50% (ED50) and therefore contained higher levels of neutralising antibody in the serum. In contrast, cTfh17 cell frequencies on day 14 and day 28 were negatively correlated with the measured neutralising activity (Figure 7b). These findings could also be confirmed by correlations of activated CD38+, ICOS+CD38+, ICOS+PD\u20101+ and PD\u20101+CD38+ cTfh1 and cTfh17 cells with the level of neutralising activity (Figure 7c\u2013f).",

We showed that activation and polarisation of CXCR5+ Tfh cells and CXCR5\u2212 memory T helper cells change in response to vaccination with the live\u2010attenuated yellow fever vaccine YF\u201017D and that the frequencies of cTfh1\u2010polarised cells is predictive for the level of neutralising activity in the serum of vaccinees. Alterations in cTfh and cTmem frequencies followed similar patterns, mirrored the changes seen in regulatory T cells and CD8+ T cells after YF vaccination and were accompanied by an increase in the frequency of ASCs. The peak of activation was detected on day 14 for most lymphocyte subsets investigated. These kinetics are in accordance with previous publications that used various activation markers and their combinations, including CD38, Ki67 and HLA\u2010DR\n18\n, \n20\n, \n21\n, \n27\n or TCR repertoire sequencing, to track the YF\u201017D response of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells.\n28\n, \n29\n\n",

Furthermore, tetramer\u2010positive CD4+ T cells were mostly of the Th1 and Tfh1 cell subtype, again highlighting the role of those subsets in the immune response to YF\u201017D. cTfh cells thereby recognised the same peptide epitopes of the capsid and envelop protein, as well as non\u2010structural protein 1 that had been described to dominate the CXCR5\u2212 Th1 cell subset.\n26\n CD4+ T cells recognising the NS3 49\u201365 peptide epitope did not show the clear Th1/Tfh1 polarisation dominance seen in cells specific for the other three antigens tested and comprised almost equal numbers of Th1/Tfh1, Th2/Tfh2 and Th17/Tfh17 cells.
