Medical records of them were uploaded by the designated hospitals through the epidemic reporting system of the National Health Commission of the People's Republic China. The data were sent to the data-processing center in Beijing and updated each day. Under the coordination of the National Health Commission of the PRC, we extracted information regarding epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics, treatment and outcomes with customized data collection forms. Two researchers (LC and QL) reviewed the data collection forms independently to check data reliability. The data cutoff for the study was from December 8, 2019 to March 20, 2020. We identified 118 pregnant women with Covid-19 and analyzed their disease spectrum in the present study. We collected the number of the total Covid-19 patients during the study period from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, and then calculated the constituent ratio of pregnant patients. We also acquired the number of delivered pregnant women in Wuhan city during the study period from the Maternal and Child Health system of Hubei Province, and then calculated the incidence of Covid-19 among deliveries.",

Besides those who were diagnosed through nucleic acid tests, in order to present the entire spectrum of disease, we also included clinical confirmed cases according to the criterion of the fifth edition guideline. 2 Clinically-diagnosed cases were defined as a suspected case in Hubei province who had manifestations with pneumonia image features on computerized tomography (CT) scan (Other potential cause of pneumonia was rule out before diagnosed). The degree of severity (severe and critical case) was classified by using the mentioned guidance. Severe cases were defined as meeting one of these conditions: 1) respiratory rate \u2265 30 breaths/min; 2) arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) over inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO2) of less than 300 mmHg; 3) Percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2) \u2264 93% on room air at rest. Critical cases were defined as on the following conditions: 1) occurrence of severe respiratory distress; 2) respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation; 3) shock and organ failure even needs of ICU care. According to the mentioned Guidance, patients met the criterion would be discharged: 1) Body temperature returns to normal for more than 3 days; 2). Respiratory symptoms improve significantly; 3) Pulmonary imaging shows significant improvement in acute exudative lesions; 4) Negative nucleic acid test of respiratory tract specimens such as sputum and nose swab for consecutive times (sampling time at least 24 hours apart).",
