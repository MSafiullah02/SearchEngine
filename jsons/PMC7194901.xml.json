By the beginning of April, more than 1,000,000 positive cases with 51,737 deaths have been reported (1). A worldwide response to maintain the healthcare system is essential during the pandemic. The main reason for delaying the elective procedures is to ensure that the healthcare system keeps up with the pandemic. Numerous concerns emerge regarding whether to defer the vascular procedures as well as the protection measures in the course of treatment of a COVID-19 patient.",

Deferring the elective operations and redefining the major hospitals as \u201cpandemic hospitals\u201d are the main measures taken by authorities. The majority of the larger volume cardiovascular centers have become pandemic hospitals mainly serving COVID-19 patients. Even though some hospitals have at first seemed like they would be COVID-free; later on, the impossibility of having any COVID-free center during this rapidly increasing pandemic has been realized. In this context; our center, which is also a designated pandemic hospital, has deferred all elective operations, to the greatest extent possible. The arrangements of shifts for the workplaces have been organized such as to have a vascular surgeon on duty at all times (one day on and four days off for each surgeon) especially for all types of open vascular surgeries. Moreover, our endovascular surgical team consisting of two senior and four junior surgeons is at all times on call for endovascular procedures.",

Beside the health-center capacity, the emergency situations should be determined specifically for each surgical specialty. Therefore, we have employed a concept of \u201cLevel of Priority\u201d for cardiovascular procedures (2). The modified version of this concept for vascular surgery is summarized at Table I\n. The classification of cases under the major headings may be relevant in terms of making decisions for patients during the pandemic. This is also essential for protecting the healthcare staff from possible/asymptomatic COVID patients. Patients whose COVID status is unknown can be better identified through this classification. LoP I conditions can be delayed to the greatest extent possible. LoP II-IV conditions should be reconsidered on each patient basis and the availability of the healthcare system. In our center, all LoP I patients are subjected to deferral, and our team is diligently dealing with all urgent and emergency cases. In the last decade, the tendency to implement endovascular procedures on many patients has prevailed in vascular surgery. The current situation may provide us with a chance to treat patients upon a decline in the durations of operations in open surgeries and the surgeries implemented with local/regional anesthesia which are preferred over intubation and the use of ventilators to minimize the potential for exposure to aerosol generating procedures (3). Endovascular procedures may be beneficial for blood conservation as well.",

A face shield over goggles and mask, surgical coat and preferably double gloves fixed with adhesive drapes to the surgical coat are recommended for additional protection during surgery (2). Aside from PPE, the preparation of OR, transportation of the patient and disinfection measures for OR stand out as other important concerns (2).",
