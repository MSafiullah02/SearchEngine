Until recently, the infrequent spillover of these viruses into humans and the fact that spillover often occurred in remote locations, coupled with a limited knowledge of non-human reservoir hosts, the use of low-output genomic sequencing, and biosafety and biosecurity restrictions on filovirus research, contributed to the paucity of publicly available data on filovirus genome sequences1. In December 2013, complete genome sequences for only 29 ebolaviruses and 65 marburgviruses were available2 despite the fact that 35 outbreaks of natural filovirus disease had been recorded3.",

Indeed, as predicted6, metagenomic sequencing has become a powerful tool for identifying novel viruses and, crucially, for predicting pathogen emergence7. Targeted or unbiased sequencing of individual clinical samples aids in the identification of outbreaks, the determination of outbreak aetiology and the definition of virus transmission chains by identifying chain-defining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Furthermore, field transcriptomics improves our understanding of host responses to virus infection and will be important in deciphering the differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic disease states and in predicting whether patients with acute and chronic disease will survive8. Functional genomics is becoming the tool of choice for the rapid characterization of patient-specific viruses that have not been isolated in culture or that cannot be equitably shared among laboratories across borders9. Finally, the genomic analysis of patient-specific viruses also enables precision medicine by predicting the efficacy of available medical countermeasures (MCMs) against these individual viruses.",

We also examine the phenomena of Ebola virus (EBOV) persistence in human hosts and provide an overview of recent genomic advances in threat characterization, vaccine development and immunotherapy.

Genomic sequencing efforts during this EVD outbreak showcased various platforms and strategies to characterize thousands of human clinical samples containing EBOV/Mak36. Early efforts relied on exporting positive samples to high-complexity genomic centres abroad37,38 (Box 2). However, in December 2014, EBOV/Mak genome sequencing using benchtop sequencers, such as the MiSeq System (Illumina) and the Ion Torrent system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in-country (namely, in Liberia and Sierra Leone), became standard practice39\u201341. In addition, field laboratories used the iSeq 100 (Illumina), a portable bench-top sequencer with low error rates that can be transported in a suitcase, to obtain complete EBOV genome sequences to determine virus transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo42,43. Use of the portable nanopore sequencing technology MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) markedly reduced the time required to obtain the genome sequence from patient samples and enabled the reintroduction of EBOV into Guinea and Sierra Leone to be rapidly confirmed41. Similarly, the EBOV variants causing the 2018 \u00c9quateur Province EVD (EBOV/\u201cTum\u201d) and the ongoing Nord-Kivu/Sud-Kivu/Ituri Province EVD outbreak caused by EBOV/\u201cItu\u201d in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were quickly identified by the use of MinION42,44.",

The earliest evidence of an EBOV co-infection was obtained in Gabon in 2002, where a patient with EVD also tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1; a lentivirus of the Retroviridae family)55. During the 2013\u20132016 Western African outbreak, co-infections of patients with EBOV with malaria-causing plasmodia or viruses such as GB virus C (a pegivirus of the family Flaviviridae), hepatitis B virus (an orthohepadnavirus of the family Hepadnaviridae) and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (a lymphocryptovirus of the family Herpesviridae) were reported56\u201358. Additionally, EBOV infections in patients with a Gram-negative septicaemia or with bacterial translocation have been described59\u201361. Moreover, an extensive infectious disease due to one particular virus could plausibly conceal a simultaneous outbreak caused by a different pathogen62. Notoriously, there have been outbreaks of cholera, plague, measles and malaria, and sporadic cases of monkeypox and yellow fever, alongside the 2018\u2012present EVD outbreak in the north-eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Detecting and characterizing co-infections during a disease outbreak can provide clinicians with crucial point-of-care information and identify differences in patient outcomes that may result from co-occurring infections.",

However, metagenomic sequencing is limited by the requirement for computational and bioinformatics resources, which are not always readily available under field conditions. Instead, target-enrichment approaches using a wide breadth of bait probes for known pathogenic viruses, including filoviruses, have led to the successful characterization of known viruses in clinical samples from patients with disease of unknown etiology66\u201368. Moreover, target-enrichment sequencing is more cost-effective than metagenomic approaches. The percentage of sequencing data matching the target pathogen or pathogens can range from 50% to 99% with target enrichment, whereas with metagenomics approaches often <1% of sequencing data matches the target69,70.",

The first application of in-country, real-time genomic epidemiology started well into the EVD outbreak of 2013\u20132016 in Western Africa; portable sequencing was performed and data were analysed in tangent with up-to-date public health data41. The abundance of EBOV genome sequences determined during recent large-scale EVD outbreaks (including the 2013\u20132016 outbreak and the 2018\u2013present outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) enabled real-time and retrospective investigations, using median-joining haplotype network establishment and phylodynamic inferences, to reveal cryptic human EBOV transmission chains in humans42,49,72,73. In coordination with classical epidemiological data (for example, that obtained by manual contact tracing), individual virus transmission events identified by genomic analysis such as median-joining haplotype networks can be temporally and spatially linked to determine likely transmission pathways, including the mode of virus diffusion and the identification of \u2018superspreaders\u2019 (as reviewed in ref.45)73,74 (Fig. 3). As the quality and quantity of available, complete genome sequences improves, new methods identifying intra-host SNPs may provide more granular analyses of person-to-person transmission than previous techniques39. Such SNPs can distinguish between almost identical consensus sequences of two or more patients75. However, acute infections resulting from direct contact with a recently infected and symptomatic individual, and for which primary infection occurred <21 days before the onset of symptoms, is not the only route for sustained person-to-person transmission during filovirus disease outbreaks.",

Thus, it is expected that sites of EBOV persistence that are not immune-privileged will be discovered. EBOV can be detected in breastmilk of female survivors of EVD and in various tissues, including the blood and liver, of laboratory mice that have been experimentally infected with EBOV and have partial immunity up to 150 days post-exposure108,109. Persistence in sites that are not immune-privileged has also been recently reported for CCHFV106 and LASV110,111. Interestingly, CCHFV persists within granulomas of NHP survivors with latent tuberculosis106. LASV persists in the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels with vasculitis in both crab-eating macaque and domesticated guinea pig survivors110,111, suggesting that a local altered immunological environment may sustain viral persistence.",

Genomic studies of persistent infections revealed distinct evolutionary dynamics that might result in patterns that can help identify the source of the flare-ups100. During the 2013\u20122016 EVD outbreak, an unexpectedly low genetic diversity and complementary epidemiological data provided the first evidence of EBOV sexual transmission49,73. Recent pathogenesis studies elucidated the persistent infection of EBOV and MARV in seminiferous tubules101,102 and epididymides55, but niche-specific genomic studies (or single-cell sequencing efforts) have yet to be reported. Certain EBOV mutations may be tissue-specific and may therefore be required to establish persistence; genomics will be key in identifying these mutations. For instance, the sequencing of EBOV genomes present in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with EVD during a relapse revealed that only two non-coding changes to the genome had occurred compared to the originally obtained EBOV genomes sequenced from plasma during the acute phase of disease93. Multiple or even single nucleotide changes may permit EBOV to transverse the blood\u2013brain barrier by directly infecting endothelial cells and microglia cells and establishing a persistent infection91. Although EBOV and MARV have been detected and isolated from the aqueous humour of EVD survivors with uveitis80,95 and in breastmilk of survivors109, genomic studies have not yet investigated the evolutionary dynamics in these niches.",

The seroprevalence rate of these individuals, categorized as asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic, has been reported to be >1% throughout Africa112\u2013117. Transcriptomics offer insight as to why certain factors, such as the source, viral load, and infectivity of EBOV or host genetics, contribute to the range of disease severity and survivorship in patients. Host \u2018immune gene signatures\u2019 in patients infected with EBOV/Mak have been associated with clinical prognosis8,118. Indeed, data generated from 112 patients infected with EBOV/Mak (24 survivors and 88 fatal cases) revealed that interferon response-related genes and acute-phase responses were dysregulated in patients who did not survive8. However, natural killer cell populations were increased in EVD survivors, suggesting a crucial role for natural killer cells in controlling EBOV infection. Furthermore, low levels of inflammation and robust T cell responses with an upregulation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD1) expression in T cells also correlated with survival from EVD118. Additional transcriptomic studies focusing on the population dynamics of EBOV in infected humans and possibly in naive NHPs will complement earlier characterization of host responses to EVD and provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms of EVD pathogenesis and disease outcome. Bringing transcriptomics tools to the field, facilitated by our ability to perform genomic sequencing in outbreak areas, will allow the promises of precision medicine to be realized in an outbreak setting.",

            "text": "The genomic characterization of an outbreak pathogen is only the first step in characterizing a threat, a process that can be facilitated by reverse functional genomics. Classical reverse genetics has focused on the virus rescue of filoviruses based on cloning a reference (that is, a consensus) filovirus sequence or using a replicating filovirus isolate to clone filovirus sequences61,62. However, synthetic reverse genomics can rapidly rescue individual virus haplotypes or genotypes from a virus population in the absence of replicating isolates, using gene and genome synthesis based on sequence information alone. These rescued viruses can be used to evaluate the functional aspects of individual filovirus genome mutations. Thus, functional genomics can facilitate the rapid and precise functional characterization of a newly emerging filovirus or filovirus mutant. Given that natural filovirus isolates must be studied while fulfilling strict biosafety and biosecurity requirements that are frequently not available in areas of filovirus disease outbreaks, the availability of in-country and field-deployable sequencing platforms increases the ability of researchers to gather crucial information about the virus without the need to export biological specimens across national borders. To succeed, field sequencing needs to produce highly accurate finished filovirus genome sequences (for example, sequences that include the complete genomic leader and trailer regions of the virus) from a variety of sample sources31,42,72. Filoviruses rescued from synthetic reverse genetics systems can then be used to study host adaptation and attenuation as well as the efficacy of therapeutics118\u2013121. The de novo generation of EBOV from the ongoing EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (that is, of EBOV/\u201cItu\u201d) demonstrates the value of synthetic reverse genetics9 (Fig. 5). After the development of modular reverse genetic systems that are even more efficient than those available today, even high-throughput phenotypical characterizations of large numbers of minimally divergent filoviruses are likely to be possible even in the absence of a biological isolate.",

However, the population dynamics and evolution of EBOV are influenced by mutations in RNA, RNA recombination rates, virus population bottlenecks, natural selection and fitness (including diversifying and purifying selection), host range and mode of transmission123. These traits re-adjust depending on the environment in a natural host, a naive accidental host, a previously exposed accidental host (owing to infection or vaccination) or an accidental host that received an MCM. Therapeutic pressures will force the selection of individual EBOV genotypes, and thereby adaption, to ensure virus survival or persistence. Highly accurate genomic data can be used to evaluate available MCMs in silico prior to in vitro and in vivo testing and to characterize host responses to specific therapeutic interventions in real time. For example, accurate sequencing data from EBOV/\u201cItu\u201d allowed for the rapid in silico assessment of the ability of the mAb114 (National Institutes of Health) and ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical) mAbs to bind to the receptor-binding domain of the EBOV spike glycoprotein GP1,2, predicting that these mAbs should be effective against circulating EBOV/\u201cItu\u201d42.

The Pamoja Tulinde Maisha (PALM) randomized controlled trial recently evaluated four investigational therapeutics (ZMapp, remdesivir (Gilead Sciences, Inc.), mAb114 and REGN-EB3 (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals)) in the treatment of EVD130. mAb114 (a single mAb) and REGN-EB3 (a cocktail of three mAbs) were significantly more effective than ZMapp (a cocktail of three mAbs) in treating EVD (P = 0.007 and P = 0.002, respectively) and were also more effective than remdesivir (a nucleoside analogue); the effect of ZMapp and remdesivir on EVD was not significantly different. mAb114, obtained from a 1995 EVD survivor from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is one of several recently identified ebolavirus-neutralizing antibodies that are being developed as therapeutics for EVD129\u2013132. This mAb protected NHPs from EBOV-induced disease and death, even when administered 5 days after inoculation with EBOV133. As mAb114 binds to the EBOV glycoprotein GP1,2, the risk of escape mutants arising might be constrained by viral fitness. REGN-EB3 also showed promising results in EBOV-exposed NHPs, and no mutant viruses were reported to escape this MCM134,135. By contrast, EBOV mutants that escape ZMapp have been characterized136. A mutation in amino acid residue 508 of EBOV GP1,2 abrogated its binding to two of the mAbs within ZMapp, and a mutation in amino acid residue 273 of EBOV GP1,2 abrogated its binding to the third mAb137. Moreover, epitope mapping of EBOV GP1,2 using an alanine-scanning assay138 identified several residues that are crucial for antibodies to bind to EBOV GP1,2, although none of these mutations was tested for fitness.",

We hypothesize that the characterization of the EBOV population in individuals who did not benefit from treatment in the PALM trial might help elucidate the reasons for this failure. A clear demonstration of the power of genomics for this purpose was the investigation of two NHPs that succumbed to experimental EBOV exposure despite experimental treatment with MB-003, a cocktail of three mAbs. Two clusters of genomic mutations (a cluster of five non-synonymous changes in one animal and a cluster of four non-synonymous changes in the other) reduced the binding of the three mAbs to EBOV GP1,2 (Fig. 6). Viral isolates obtained after MB-003 treatment recapitulated the observed \u2018escape\u2019 phenotype. The mutations, all located in the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) gene, abrogated antibody binding to GP1,2. Although this study was restricted in size, it highlights mechanisms by which EBOV can evade immunotherapies. First, adaptation to a selection pressure can occur rapidly. Second, methods to monitor the appearance and phasing of viral mutants that can escape immunotherapies are crucial. Third, with the use of reverse genetics systems, scientists can acquire pertinent information on the therapeutic efficacy of sequence-based MCMs during an ongoing outbreak of EVD9 (Fig. 5). For example, phenotypical changes resulting from clade-defining non-synonymous mutations (for example, alanine to histidine substitution at residue 547 in nucleoprotein or isoleucine to methionine substitution at residue 78 in viral protein 35, both in EBOV/\u201cItu\u201d) or positively selected non-synonymous mutations identified in the ongoing outbreak can be investigated.",

Cost is a consideration, but the limited number of experimental animals typically available for therapeutic investigations (~5\u201310) reduces the analytical power of comparative virus\u2013host interactions and inter-host population-level genomics. In addition, experiments aimed at understanding the appearance of antiviral resistance are restrictive; precise protocols to measure and evaluate EBOV and the host immune response to infection without violating established policies are urgently required. Furthermore, the possibility that a more virulent or less treatable virus may evolve during such experiments and be accidently released is a concern, which is why Institutional Biosafety Committees are cautious in approving experiments aimed at creating such viruses. Additionally, concerns may arise from other nations that are parties of the Biological Weapons and Toxins Convention. Convincing national rivals that experiments resulting in EBOV strains that are resistant to MCMs were actually intended to strengthen MCMs, and not to deliberately create biological weapons, is not straightforward.",

Greater investments in in-country genomic infrastructure and mobile sequencing platforms have reduced the time from sample to viral genome sequence and simultaneously informed local clinicians, epidemiologists and public health officials of genome-guided information on the virus responsible for a current outbreak. Advances in large-scale and timely data generation encourage future genomic studies to go beyond consensus-level pathogen genome sequencing during an outbreak. For example, persistent infections in immune-privileged sites of survivors can be characterized using single-cell sequencing technologies. Additionally, an increased focus on host responses in an infected individual and the contribution of host genome characteristics to disease outcome and transmission would potentially further benefit the development of MCMs and improve the outbreak response. Complete pathogen\u2013host genomic investigations could be applied to infected individuals, NHPs and known natural host reservoirs of filoviruses. The successful integration of current and future genomic tools will rely on the establishment of new long-term partnerships between government, academia and public health agencies and on maintaining in-country genomic capabilities where the threat of filovirus outbreaks is imminent.",

A theoretical median-joining haplotype network of the Nord-Kivu/Sud-Kivu/Ituri Province EVD outbreak caused by EBOV/\u201cItu\u201d in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (provinces are indicated on the map) provides different hypotheses that may explain person-to-person transmission events. A consistent number of genomic changes occurring in a specific window of time can indicate acute transmission events (that is, transmission via close contact with an individual with EVD, bottom left). The detection of transmission depends on diagnostics and sampling frequency. When sampling frequency is low, flare-up cases of EVD can appear with limited epidemiological data and with an unexpectedly large number of differences to earlier sampled haplotypes, which may point to undetected transmission networks (middle left; indicated by dashed lines). When viral diversity cannot be explained by spillover and spatial\u2013temporal estimations, a secondary spillover may be possible (top left). Persistent infections through sexual transmission present with low genetic diversity (that is, with a slow evolutionary rate) over periods (bottom right) that are much longer than expected for acute reintroduction at the expected evolutionary rate (top right). A similar analysis was performed during the first discovery of sexual transmission during the 2013\u20132016 Western African EVD outbreak73, and a theoretical example is shown (bottom right). This example indicates the number of days after the initial presentation of symptoms at which an acutely infected male is sampled (day 4) and the day at which he recovers (day 20). On day 175, the sexual partner of this male becomes symptomatic owing to a very similar EBOV genotype, confirmed with epidemiological information and visualized using a median-joining haplotype network.",

Rapid, high accuracy, complete genome sequences determined in-country are shared with out-of-country collaborators to evaluate key genomic and proteomic changes in Ebola virus (EBOV) that may affect the efficacy of available therapeutics (part a). For example, changes in the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding site of the EBOV polymerase cofactor viral protein 35 (VP35), a protein targeted by several therapeutics, can be identified from the sequencing data obtained for a new EBOV isolate. Changes in this region of VP35 may compromise the efficacy of treatments. Indeed, if two available therapeutic agents (hypothetical treatment A and hypothetical treatment B) target VP35, reverse genetic systems can produce replicative EBOVs de novo that contain the changes identified in VP35 (part b). These replicative EBOVs can then be used for the in vitro and in vivo therapeutic evaluation of both hypothetical treatments; data obtained using this approach can inform on which treatment is potentially more efficacious against the EBOV isolate causing the outbreak.",

After an inter-host bottleneck, viral diversity should be low in the earliest phase of infection (1).
