Despite recent advances in comprehensive management of trauma patients, sepsis is still a life-threatening condition with poor outcome. The risk factors of patients for the development of sepsis usually refer to their physiological characteristics, underlying illnesses and clinical treatment backgrounds. The patients with one or more of these factors are susceptible to sepsis. The most vulnerable populations for sepsis are the elderly and infants, patients with chronic diseases, patients with severe trauma and burns, those who are immunocompromised or receiving immunosuppressive therapy, and malnourished and debilitated patients. Early diagnosis of sepsis plays a significant role for each hour of delay of appropriate antibiotic therapy increases mortality by 7.6 % [1]. However, the accurate and timely detection of sepsis remains a great challenge nowadays, because of the various, insidious and nonspecific clinical manifestations as well as the complex and indeterminate pathophysiologic process. Therefore, neither the clinical microbiological detection, which is known as the golden standard of infection, nor the most traditional biomarkers can fulfill all the existing needs in the early diagnosis and management of sepsis [2].",

            "text": "Originally, sepsis has been defined as infection with at least 2 of the 4 SIRS criteria, which mainly focus on inflammation that is not covered the full pathobiology. Sepsis is now recognized to involve early activation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses, along with major modifications in nonimmunologic pathways such as cardiovascular, neuronal, autonomic, hormonal, bioenergetic, metabolic, and coagulation, all of which have prognostic significance [3]. Sepsis is refined as \u201clife-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection\" [3]. There is an extensive and complicated pathogen-host interaction during the process of infection. Sepsis develops when the initial, appropriate host response to pathogens becomes amplified and then dysregulated [4]. It is the ability of host immunologic defense that determines the fate of infecting organisms: whether be localized, phagocytized and erased by immunocytes which may cause the release of their components from the invading pathogens; or multiply in the local tissues, successfully leak into the bloodstream and eventually become bacteremia and sepsis. Pathogen itself and its structural components not only cause extensive changes of both innate and acquired immunities, but also exert a profound influence on the systems of nerve, endocrine, respiration, circulation, and metabolism etc. [4]. Traditional biomarkers of sepsis are mainly derived from this host immuno-inflammatory response. The emergence and development of a variety of high throughput omics technologies will contribute to a more comprehensive screening for sepsis-specific biomarkers. Based on the discussion of current traditional sepsis biomarkers, we address new insights into sepsis biomarkers in the field of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, those may show the hope for more comprehensive understanding of sepsis and help to overcome the present diagnostic uncertainty.",

            "text": "Given the complicated pathophysiology in sepsis which involves hundreds of mediators or single molecules, it is unlikely to identify one single biomarker which is able to satisfy all the existing needs and expectations in sepsis research and management. CRP, for example, is frequently used to assess the presence of infection and sepsis [2], and there is a positive correlation between its plasma level and the risk of organ dysfunction and death [13, 14]. However, plasma concentrations of CRP may increase during minor infection and do not adequately reflect the severity of infection, or remain at a high level for several days, even overstay the infection [2]. Besides, CRP may experience an increase during the inflammation caused by noninfectious etiologies, such as tumor, tissue necrosis or operation, which explains its nonspecificity as an early stage sepsis biomarker. Meanwhile, PCT, perceived as the most potential biomarker, is listed as one of the diagnostic criteria for sepsis [15]. A recent meta-analysis of PCT that included 30 studies found mean sensitivity and specificity of 0.77 and 0.79 respectively, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.85 [16]. Although PCT was thought as a helpful biomarker for early diagnosis of sepsis in critically ill patients, it was not suitable to be recommended as the single definitive diagnostic test [16].",

In a prospective cohort study including 151 patients with systemic inflammatory responsesyndrome (SIRS), Kofoed et al. [17] found that the AUCs of six biomarkers\u2014suPAR (0.5), sTREM-1 (0.61), MIF (0.63), PCT (0.72), neutrophil count (0.74), CRP (0.81)\u2014for detection of a bacterial cause of inflammation had ranged from 0.5 to 0.81. With method reported by Xiong et al. [18], which discussed the statistical estimation of the optimum linear combination test and the associated maximum area under the ROC curve, Kofoed got the combined AUC of the six-marker test at 0.88. Consequently, the six-marker test had a better diagnostic accuracy in detecting bacterial versus nonbacterial causes of inflammation, and significantly greater than that of each single marker. Similarly, in another prospective research among the critically ill patients [19], a \u2018bioscore\u2019 combining the polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) CD64 index together with PCT and sTREM-1 serum levels was put forward to diagnose sepsis and had a better performance with an AUC of 0.97 than that of each individual biomarker, and was externally confirmed in the validation cohort with 90.9 % of patients being correctly classified by the very model. Although the combination of biomarkers do improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, due to the factors of time-consuming, economic cost, the amount of sample, the feasibility of biomarkerdetection method and so on, it has a limited application in clinical practice and still needs further prospective studies conducted in multicenter on cost-effectiveness.",

A clinical study [22] found that plasma cytokine concentrations, as well as nDNA and mtDNA levels of septic shockpatients were increased at the onset of septic shock and remained elevated. And during the first 5 days of septic shock, nDNA levels consistently correlated with plasma cytokine concentrations as well as with the shock-related parameter norepinephrine infusion rate and markers of organ damage (total bilirubin and creatinine). These findings not only indicate a relationship between plasma nDNA levels and the inflammatory response, but also demonstrate that nDNA levels are associated with markers of shock and organ damage in septic shock patients.",

For example, burn patients with TLR4 and TNF-\u03b1 polymorphisms were 1.8 times more likely to develop severe sepsis, but none of them were significantly associated with mortality [33]. TLR1 SNPs are associated with increased mortality in patients with gram-positive sepsis after traumatic injury, which may represent a novel marker of risk for death in critically injured patients [27]. And most recently, it was found that there was a new association between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) +936 CC genotype and the risk to develop acute kidney injury (AKI) in severe sepsis patients [35]. Genome-wide SNP genotyping assays allow to detect hundreds of thousands of SNPs accurately in a single experiment [39, 40] and are expected to be of great applicative prospect in finding novel sepsis susceptibility-associated SNP genotypes.",

Based on this finding, another study demonstrated that global DNA methylation varied significantly among newborns with sepsis and those without sepsis [50]. More specifically, a recent study analyzed the CpG methylation status in the epigenome of septic and non-septic babies [51] or ICU patients [52]. Given biological and clinical significance, they found 81 differentially methylated CpGs located in 64 genes, and a panel of differentially methylated protocadherin \u03b2 (PCDHB) genes that play vital role in leukocyte cell adhesion and Wnt signaling pathway. These genes play vital role in calcium dependent cell to cell adhesion and other immunological processes like antigen processing and presentation. In sepsis, suppression of leukocyte cell adhesion and migration may exaggerate disease severity and poor outcome due to multiple organ dysfunctions. Therefore, this study provides some novel insights into the role of DNA methylation in neonatal sepsis.

The data correctly predict the onset of sepsis in an average of 83.09 % of patient cases between 1 and 4 days before clinical diagnosis with high sensitivity and selectivity (91.43 and 80.20 %, respectively). Sutherland et al. [59] evaluated transcriptional profiles in circulating white blood cells of ICU sepsis patients, post-surgical patients and healthy controls with a microarray and multiplex tandem (MT)-PCR. A panel of 42-gene expression markers was identified, by which the prediction of sepsiswithin a mixed inflammatory population had an AUC between 86 and 92 %. Sepsis has a unique gene expression profile that is different from uninfected inflammation and becomes apparent prior to the clinical manifestations of sepsis for 0\u201348 h [60]. In that case, the specific gene expression profile, which may involve the function of innate immunity, cytokine receptors, T cell differentiation as well as the protein synthesis, may make a reference for early diagnosis of sepsis.",

Similarly, Zeng [72, 73] investigated the levels of miR-150 and miR-143 in peripheral blood leukocytes in sepsis patients with RT-PCR, and found that the expression levels of miR-150 and miR-143 were significantly decreased in sepsis patients and could reflect the severity of sepsis in certain degree, which not only made it a marker to reflect the situation of inflammatory response, but also made it a prognostic marker in sepsis. Recently, higher serum miR-133a levels were found among sepsis patients in ICU [74]. As they were significantly correlated with disease severity, classical markers of inflammation and bacterial infection, as well as organ failure, high miR-133a levels were considered as independent biomarkers for unfavorable prognosis of critically ill patients.",

In addition, serum miR-146a and miR-223 were found significantly reduced in septic patients compared with SIRS patients and healthy controls which might serve as new biomarkers for sepsis with high specificity and sensitivity [76].

Metabolic profile of the serum from septic rats with cecal ligation and puncture was achieved with the help of NMR and LC/MS [83]. In the septic rats, especially the non-survivors, many free fatty acids showed a lower level which may be consumed greatly for energy supply in sepsis and may be related with the prognosis of sepsis. Moreover, there was a rise of some polyunsaturated fatty acids in the very group, which may have a relationship with the increased anti-inflammatory effect. Based on the metabolic profile analysis, a model for outcome predication was built with high sensitivity and specificity, which provided a novel method for sepsis prognosis judgment. NMR-based metabolic profiling revealed the difference of metabolites of energy metabolism and inflammation in lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and serum samples between the septic rat and the control rat [84]. In septic rats, creatine concentration increased in all the three types of samples, whereas alanine and phosphoethanolamine concentrations increased only both in lung tissue and in serum. Myoinositol increased in lung tissue but decreased in BAL fluid. In addition, acetoacetate increased whereas formate decreased in serum.
