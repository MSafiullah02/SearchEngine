The highest threat agents, the Category A pathogens, have the greatest potential for adverse public health impact and mass casualties if used in ill-intentioned ways. Within the Category A pathogens, there are a number of viruses that can cause viral hemorrhagic fevers with high case fatality rates. The Category A hemorrhagic fever viruses pose serious threats as potential biological weapons because they can: (1) be disseminated through aerosols, (2) cause disease at a low dose (1\u201310 plaque forming unit (pfu)), (3) cause severe morbidity and mortality (case fatality rates of 15\u201330%), (4) cause fear and panic in the general public, and (5) can be readily produced in large quantities (Charrel and de Lamballerie, 2003). The availability of antiviral drugs directed at these viruses would provide treatment and a strong deterrent against their use as biowarfare agents. Since antiviral drugs can be easily administered (oral pill or liquid) and exert their antiviral effect within hours of administration, they will serve to effectively treat diseased patients, protect those suspected of being exposed to the pathogen (post-exposure prophylaxis), and assist in the timely containment of an outbreak.",

The S RNA segment encodes the major structural proteins, nucleocapsid protein (NP) and a precursor envelope protein (GPC) encoding two envelope glycoproteins (external GP1 and transmembrane GP2) (Beyer et al., 2003, Froeschke et al., 2003, Kunz et al., 2003, Lenz et al., 2001), and the L RNA segment encodes the RNA polymerase protein L and an 11 kDa protein, Z protein, with putative regulatory function (Bowen et al., 1996). GP1 and GP2, which form the tetrameric surface glycoprotein spike, are responsible for virus entry into targeted host cells. The Arenaviridae family has been divided into two groups according to sequence-based phylogeny. The \u2018Old World\u2019 group, endemic in Africa, includes the human pathogens lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus and Lassa virus. The \u2018New World\u2019 group, endemic in Latin America, is divided into three clades. Clade B includes in addition to Tacaribe and Amapari viruses, the Category A human pathogenic viruses Jun\u00edn (Argentine hemorrhagic fever), Machupo (Bolivian hemorrhagic fever), Guanarito (Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever), and Sabi\u00e1 (Brazilian hemorrhagic fever). These Category A viruses are capable of causing severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever disease in humans.",

A number of in vitro inhibitors of arenavirus replication have been reported in the literature (Candurra et al., 1996, Glushakova et al., 1990, Petkevich et al., 1981, Wachsman et al., 2000, Rawls et al., 1976) with modest activity and significant toxicity. Ribavirin is the only compound that has shown partial efficacy against some arenavirus infections, but with a high level of undesirable secondary reactions (Enria and Maiztegui, 1994). Ribavirin is a nonimmunosuppressive nucleoside analogue with broad antiviral properties (Jahrling, 1997). Ribavirin has been shown to reduce mortality from Lassa fever in high-risk patients (Jahrling, 1997). Treatment of viral hemorrhagic fever currently consists primarily of supportive care (Enria and Maiztegui, 1994, Garcia et al., 2000, Leifer et al., 1970). The only arenavirus hemorrhagic fever for which studies have been undertaken toward development of a vaccine has been Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF) caused by Jun\u00edn virus. A live-attenuated vaccine, called Candid 1, has been evaluated in controlled trials among agricultural workers in AHF-endemic areas, where it appeared to reduce the number of reported AHF cases with no serious side effects (Enria et al., 1999). It is not known if the Candid 1 vaccine would be useful against other arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers.",

Tacaribe virus is 67\u201378% identical to Jun\u00edn virus at the amino acid level for all four viral proteins. In order to screen for inhibitors of NWA a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for virus replication was developed using Tacaribe virus as a surrogate for Category A NWA. A 400,000 small molecule library was screened using this HTS assay. A lead series was chosen based on drug properties and this series was optimized through iterative chemistry resulting in the identity of a highly active and specific small molecule inhibitor of Tacaribe virus with selective activity against human pathogenic NWA (Jun\u00edn, Machupo, Guanarito, and Sabi\u00e1). This molecule demonstrates favorable pharmacodynamic properties which permitted the demonstration of in vivo anti-arenavirus activity in a newborn mouse model.",

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to evaluate the antiviral effect of compounds against CMV (MRC-5 cells) and LCMV (Vero cells). All of these assays were carried out in the appropriate media containing 2% heat-inactivated FBS. Ninety-six-well cell culture plates were seeded 24 h before use with 1.5 \u00d7 104 cells per well (Vero), 2.2 \u00d7 104 cells per well (HEp-2 and MA104), and 4.5 \u00d7 104 cells per well (MRC-5). For compound susceptibility testing, compounds (solubilized with 100% DMSO) were added to duplicate wells at final concentrations of 50, 15.8, 5, 1.6, 0.5, 0.16, 0.05, 0.016, and 0 \u03bcM. The final concentration of DMSO in the assays was 0.5%. Virus stocks were titrated in a separate experiment to determine the concentration that resulted in 90% destruction of the cell monolayer (CPE assay) after 3 days (HSV-1, Rotavirus and vaccinia) or 4 days (SARS-CoV, RSV, Tacaribe virus, Candid 1 vaccine virus and Amapari virus) or the concentration that generated an ELISA signal of 2.5 at an optical density of 650 nm (OD650) after 3 days (LCMV) or 4 days (CMV). These pre-established dilutions of virus (250 pfu for Tacaribe virus) were added to wells containing serial dilutions of compound. Uninfected cells and cells receiving virus without compound were included on each assay plate.

The New World Tacaribe complex comprises three phylogenetic lineages, designated clades A\u2013C. Clade B includes the prototypic Tacaribe virus, Amapari virus and the four South American Category A pathogens (Jun\u00edn, Machupo, Guanarito, and Sabi\u00e1). Tacaribe virus is 67\u201378% identical to Jun\u00edn virus at the amino acid level for all four viral proteins (Clegg, 2002). Working with authentic Category A arenaviruses requires maximum laboratory containment (BSL-4), and therefore presents significant logistical and safety issues. Since Tacaribe virus is closely related to the Category A pathogens it was chosen as a surrogate BSL-2 NWA for the development of a HTS assay to screen for inhibitors of virus replication.",

The CPE assay is a whole cell assay which allows for calculation of the selective index of the compounds and identification of inhibitors of any essential steps in the virus life cycle. Of the 400,000 compounds screened in the Tacaribe virus HTS assay, 2347 hits were identified (0.58% hit rate). All of these hits had EC50 values \u22645 \u03bcM. The 2347 hits were then qualified based on four criteria: (i) chemical tractability, (ii) inhibitory potency, (iii) inhibitory selectivity, and (iv) antiviral specificity. A chemically tractable compound is defined as an entity that is synthetically accessible using reasonable chemical methodology, and which possesses chemically stable functionalities and potential drug-like qualities. Hits that passed this medicinal chemistry filter were evaluated for their inhibitory potency. EC50, CC50, and selective index (SI) values were determined to assess whether the hit was a selective inhibitor. Hits with SI values of at least 10 were considered further. Of the 2347 hits identified, 36 compounds exhibited all the characteristics of quality hits. These compounds were chemically tractable, had EC50 values \u22645 \u03bcM and SI values \u226510. Among the 36 quality hits, there were several clusters of structure type. One structure type was chosen for further development and ST-336 is the representative prototype for this series.

While no virus was titrated from the dialyzed bag originally incubated with drug, more than 300 pfu of virus was titrated from the DMSO vehicle dialyzed bag (data not shown). No drug was biologically detected in the dialysis bag originally containing 5 \u03bcM of drug as measured by the incapability of the virus plus drug dialyzed mixture to inhibit freshly added Tacaribe virus (300 pfu).

In the second experiment (Fig. 3\n), Tacaribe virus was incubated in a test tube with 5 \u03bcM of ST-336 or DMSO. Serial 1:10 dilutions were performed and for some samples ST-336 was added as a specified dilution representing the concentration of drug expected following sample dilution. As virus and compound are diluted with media, the compound concentration will reach a concentration without an inhibitory effect, unless the compound was capable of binding to virus. Test virus without compound in the initial tube was also diluted in media and compound concentrations corresponding to that found in the tubes where virus and compound were diluted together was added to each virus dilution. Titration on Vero cells showed that ST-336 present in excess in the initial tube was carried over for two additional 1:10 dilutions through specific virus binding and inhibits virus infection.

Based on the time of addition experiments, it was suspected that the viral glycoproteins might be the target of ST-336. The entire glycoprotein precursor GPC region of the S segment was sequenced. Sequence analysis was performed on four wild type isolates (WT#1\u20134) and four ST-336DR isolates derived from drug selection applied to each corresponding parental wild type isolate (DR#1.1 from WT#1, DR#2.1 from WT#2, DR#3.1 from WT#3 and DR#4.1 from WT#4). The sequence analysis showed that the GPC gene from the four parental wild type isolates had identical sequences. When compared to the GPC sequences of four drug resistant variants, each possessed a single nucleotide change that in all cases resulted in an amino acid change. Fig. 4\nA shows the location of each of the mutations which are located in or around the transmembrane domain of GP2. The sequence alignments of the region of the GP2 containing the changes is presented in Fig. 4B. The single change in DR#1.1 was at amino acid position 418 (I418T), in DR#2.1 at amino acid 416 (T416N), in DR#3.1 at amino acid 433 (S433I) and in DR#4.1 at amino acid 436 (F436I). I418 is similarly conserved (I or L, but never a T) in all clade B New World arenavirus, while T416 is conserved among all clade B NWA. F436 is similarly conserved with one exception; Amapari virus encodes a leucine at position 436. This change in Amapari virus may explain its lack of susceptibility to ST-336. I418, T416, S433 and F436 lie near the N- and C-terminal limits of the putative transmembrane domain of GP2, a region known to play a vital role in enveloped virus fusion (Bagai and Lamb, 1996, Harman et al., 2002, Jeetendra et al., 2003, West et al., 2001, Yao and Compans, 1995). Taken together, these data suggest that amino acid changes in arenavirus GP2 at either position 416, 418, 433 or 436 are sufficient to confer reduced susceptibility to ST-336 and are consistent with the proposed fusion inhibition mechanism suggested by virological experiments.",

The metabolic stability of ST-294 was tested in S9 liver extracts from rat, mouse, human, and guinea pigs and was found to be most stable in human S9 followed by mouse, rat and guinea pig respectively (Table 2). Analysis of the oral pharmacokinetics of ST-294 was initially performed in the rat as this species is well characterized for this type of study. The rats were dosed with ST-294 by oral gavage and samples were taken over a 24 h period. Serum levels were very high (C\nmax\n = 6670 ng/ml) and ST-294 has good oral bioavailability (68.2%) (Table 2).",

For the Category A agents, the experiments require BSL-4 containment. However, in an effort to obtain an initial readout, a Tacaribe virus challenge model in newborn mice was established. In preparation for this study, PK and tolerability experiments were performed with ST-294 in newborn mice prior to conducting an efficacy trial. Newborn (4-day old) BALB/c mice were dosed IP with 10 mg/kg of ST-294 and blood samples were collected for analysis. Relative to in vitro antiviral concentrations required to inhibit Tacaribe virus CPE (EC50\n = 66 ng/ml), mean plasma concentrations in newborn mice were well above this level for prolonged periods of time (>15\u00d7 through 8 h and 6\u00d7 at 24 h after dosing, data not shown). In this model the drug is delivered via the IP route due to the difficulty of performing multiple oral gavages on newborn mice. To test tolerability, newborn mice were given IP dosages ranging from 0 to 100 mg/kg/day of ST-294 for 5 days. Dosages of 100 mg/kg/day for 5 days were well tolerated by the newborn mice as there were no clinical signs of toxicity and the mice gained weight at the same rate as the control mice (data not shown). This highest tested concentration of ST-294 of 100 mg/kg/day was used in a Tacaribe animal efficacy study.",

Enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) is a potent fusion inhibitor that blocks formation of the six-helix bundle and thus prevents membrane fusion (Kinomoto et al., 2005). Enfuvirtide has been successful in improving the virological and immunological response in treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients (Oldfield et al., 2005).
