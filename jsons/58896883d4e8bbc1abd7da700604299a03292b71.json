Advances in global disease surveillance are increasingly generating datasets that are worth more than their component parts for prediction-oriented work. Here, we use a traitfree approach which leverages information on the global community of human infectious diseases to predict the biogeography of pathogens through time. Our approach takes pairwise dissimilarities between countries' pathogen communities and pathogens' geographical distributions and uses these to predict country-pathogen associations. We compare the success rates of our model for predicting pathogen outbreak, emergence and re-emergence potential as a function of time (e.g. number of years between training and prediction), pathogen type (e.g. virus) and transmission mode (e.g. vector-borne). With only these simple predictors, our model successfully predicts basic network structure up to a decade into the future. We find that while outbreak and re-emergence potential are especially well captured by our simple model, prediction of emergence events remains more elusive, and sudden global emergences like an influenza pandemic are beyond the predictive capacity of the model. However, these stochastic pandemic events are unlikely to be predictable from such coarse data. Together, our model is able to use the information on the existing country-pathogen network to predict pathogen outbreaks fairly well, suggesting the importance in considering information on co-occurring pathogens in a more global view even to estimate outbreak events in a single location or for a single pathogen.",

Intensifying pathways of contact between wildlife reservoirs and humans, and the rapid spread of new pathogens among human populations around the globe are considered major drivers in this accelerating process [5, 6] . Changes in climate and land use, as well as food insecurity and geopolitical conflict, are expected to exacerbate feedbacks between socioecological change and emerging infectious diseases (EIDs).

In part, this can be explained by the non-random distribution of host groups that disproportionately contribute to zoonotic emergence events, like bats and rodents [9, 10] , and are likely to continue to do so [11] [12] [13] . However, additional factors are strongly associated with the distribution of emerging infection risk; notably human population density, land cover and land use change [8] , as well as a broader array of social, cultural and economic factors [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

However, with increasing global connectivity, both pathogens and the free-living organisms that host them are spreading around the world at an accelerating rate, and consequently, aspects of the spatial structure of pathogen diversity are becoming less pronounced. One study examining a global pathogen-country network showed that modularity is decreasing while connectance is increasing over time: pathogen ranges are on average expanding, and over time, geographically separate regions are facing more similar threats [21, 22] .

Some recent work has examined the predictability of disease outbreak dynamics as it relates to pathogen characteristics like R 0 [23] , but this has been studied less in spatial frameworks, and often focuses on more common outbreak events than attempting to forecast emergence events. Some forecasting approaches exist that use dozens of layers ranging from human mobility to healthcare access [24, 25] , but for a newly emerging disease, it may be hard to gather these mechanistic predictors, let alone anticipate which will be relevant. As an alternative method, a recent study by Murray et al. delineated biogeographic regions based on the popular GIDEON dataset and proposed prediction based on the principle that countries that currently share more pathogens should be more likely targets during a pathogen's future outbreaks [20] . This 'co-zone' concept shows promise as a simple way of applying ecological concepts to disease forecasting, especially if data on community structure can be built into models designed with machine learning to be explicitly predictive.",

Instead, the model ranks the 'suitability' of links (an unscaled measure of link likelihood) based only on the dissimilarity of pathogens' distribution and countries' pathogen community.

Diseases of zoonotic origin (i.e. with animal hosts) and with vector-borne transmission might be harder to predict due to hidden constraints on their distribution and more complicated outbreak dynamics than directly transmitted pathogens have. On the other hand, commonalities between species that share vectors or reservoir hosts might lead to similarities in distributions (a common notion in pathogen biogeography, as in how dengue models were frequently used in the early days of the Zika pandemic, given the shared vector Aedes aegypti; [31, 32] ). In this case, the community-based prediction could be more powerful for zoonotic and vector-borne diseases. Differential frequency of zoonotic and vector-borne transmission might also make different pathogen classes (viruses, bacteria, fungi and macroparasites) more or less predictable, as might different dispersal ability on a global scale, with respiratory viruses usually presumed to spread the fastest, and macroparasites generally treated as the most dispersal-limited. Understanding how the role of community structure changes for these different pathogens can help contextualize and tailor the methods we use to predict them.",

This approach creates a single network for each year of outbreak monitoring. For every year and each combination of C and P, we have dissimilarity values for each country and pathogen, the product of their dissimilarities and the year of sampling (figure 1). The model functions by relating the probability density of these variables when a link is present (f 1 ) between country and pathogen to the overall density of the features for all possible country-pathogen pairs (f). In essence, the relationship between f 1 and f (i.e. q = f 1 /f ) represents the suitability of the country-pathogen pair given the dissimilarity and year values made conditional upon all possible country-pathogen pairs. That is, the dissimilarity and year values inform a measure akin to the potential for an outbreak event of a given pathogen to occur in a given country (i.e. the suitability for the event to occur). We estimate these suitability values (q) by separately estimating f 1 and f using the non-parametric kernel density estimator npudens from the np R package [38] . This method has been found to perform well in estimating missing links in host-parasite networks [39] and identifying suitable climatic areas for free-living species [36] . Figure 1 . The dissimilarity-based model we used considers pathogens (indicated by symbol shape) distributed across a number of countries (a). Using these data, we build the interaction matrix (b) used to calculate pathogen community dissimilarity between two countries (C ij ) and pathogen distributional dissimilarity (P ij ). We then trained models on these two values, plus their product and the year of the sampling event. The model estimates the suitability for a pathogen to occur in a given country by comparing the density of dissimilarity values when the pathogen was present (green shaded region in c) relative to the dissimilarity density of all possible pairwise combinations of country and pathogen (grey density in c). There is a possibility that a naive approach could predict pathogen outbreak events fairly well. That is, based on the frequency of pathogen occurrence within a country over time, we could estimate the probability of each country-pathogen pair by assuming it will occur with the same probability that it has occurred in the past, independent of the existing country-pathogen network. That is, if a null model were allowed to see 5 years of data, and the United States had a measles outbreak in 4 of those 5 years, a naive model would predict that a measles outbreak would occur with an 80% probability. We treated this null model as a comparison point for the accuracy metrics of our approach (light grey lines in figures).",

However, our model generally failed to forecast pathogen emergence events. This is largely unsurprising, as predicting when and where the next major public health threat will emerge is an incredibly difficult task which remains unsolved despite having received decades of attention [1, 7, 8] . However, the failure of community information to anticipate local emergences is still disappointing, especially given that biogeographic 'co-zones' could be useful strategic tools in the absence of knowledge about a newly described pathogen [17] .

While pandemic spread may be predictable using detailed information on climate, human movement and local environmental suitability [7, 42, 43] , our approach lacks these mechanistic predictors and is sensitive to these black swan events. This can be seen in reduced model performance during the 2009 flu pandemic, including for pathogens with no relationship to flu, although viruses and vector-borne pathogens are more severely affected (electronic supplementary material). So while the model benefits from pathogen community data, rare and widespread events can strongly reduce model accuracy.

This is in large part due to how time is used in the model: though year is a covariate, the model itself is not temporally explicit, meaning that the model can predict a certain link following on previous years, but it would be erroneous to interpret that as a forecast for a given point in time. However, the tool can be used to investigate pathogen outbreak and emergence potential under different pathogen range expansion scenarios. That is, by simulating pathogen spread into new geographical locations, the model could be used to identify potential pathogens that may also shift their geographical ranges. Since the method is based on dissimilarity of countries and pathogen distributions, it is possible to examine the expected outcome as pathogen distributions become more (or less) homogeneous, or countries become more (or less) dissimilar in their pathogen communities. Finally, the sensitivity of the model to pathogen shifts, transients or imperfect detection are all things that can be tested using simulation approaches and may provide further insight into our ability to forecast outbreak and emergence events.",

Our results show how a simple model considering the entire pathogen community captures important global geographical variation in outbreak potential, but as a stand-alone tool, still struggles to predict when a pathogen will first arrive in a new region. For this definition of emergence (and this dataset), we suggest this indicates an outer bound of predictive capacity based only on community structure; however, community data could be very easily leveraged alongside other socio-ecological predictors to forecast disease emergence as an ecosystem process rather than a single-species one.
