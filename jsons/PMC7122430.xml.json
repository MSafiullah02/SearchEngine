The association between thrombocytopenia and mortality has been identified in multiple studies [6, 9, 10, 12]. Regardless of the absolute value, a fall in platelet count by >30% from a patient\u2019s admission level identifies patients who may be up to 4 times more likely to die during their hospital stay [11, 13]. Patients whose platelet count fails to recover during their ICU course represent a particularly high risk group [6, 14].

Activated platelets contribute to excessive thrombin generation and the formation of microvascular clots. Concurrently, the 3 major anticoagulant systems (antithrombin, the protein C system, and TF pathway inhibitor) are dampened due to impaired synthesis and increased degradation of the relevant factors [32].

[73] A recent Cochrane review supports the conclusion that a restrictive platelet transfusion threshold is safe in patients with hematologic malignancies [74]. Guidelines by the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommend a prophylactic platelet transfusion threshold of 10 \u00d7 109 cells/L in patients with malignancy [75]. It is unclear, however, if data from patients with malignancies can be reliably generalized to the heterogeneous group of patients cared for in the ICU [76]. Some have advocated for an approach which reserves platelet transfusions for critically ill patients with clinical evidence of bleeding (regardless of the actual platelet count) [48]. However, there is insufficient data to support the safety or efficacy of this practice.",
