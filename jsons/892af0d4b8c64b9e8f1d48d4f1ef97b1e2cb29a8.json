On the other hand, virtually all patients with sepsis have coagulation abnormalities [ 19 ] . These abnormalities range from subtle activation of coagulation only detectable by sensitive techniques through somewhat subclinical stronger coagulation activation evident by a small decrease in platelet count and prolongation of global clotting times to fulminant disseminated intravascular coagulation, characterized by widespread microthrombosis and profuse bleeding [ 20 ] . At the same time, proinfl ammatory cytokines are important in inducing a procoagulant effect by inducing tissue factor expression on mononuclear cells and EC, probably playing their role in increasing the risk for new thrombosis.",

Some clinical manifestations are not directly related to the blood fl ow occlusion but to the cytokine overexpression in the ischemic necrotic tissue, leading to the so-called cytokine storm .

Different infectious agents are associated with CAPS. Among them, the most frequent reported are bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Salmonella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella , and herpes virus, affecting mainly the lungs and kidneys. Most of them are gram-negative bacteria, and, thus, these infectious agents might act co-signaling with aPLs the TLR signal that leads to the prothrombotic state and, fi nally, to CAPS.",

Malignancies have been linked to the development of circulating aPLs [ 24 ] , and the increased risk of cancer patients to develop thrombosis is well known since last century when Trousseau described the development of thrombophlebitis in these patients [ 25 ] . Several reasons have been proposed to explain the increased risk of thrombosis in cancer patients. For instance, blood fl ow stasis due to vascular invasion, immobilization, upregulation of thrombophilic substances by both tumor and endothelial cells, chemotherapy, and central venous devices have been proposed as conditions that might explain the increased frequency of thrombosis in these patients.",

However, in severe infections and in CAPS, no strong evidence has been found supporting corticosteroid use unless patients develop adrenal insuffi ciency [ 47 , 48 ] . Until more studies analyzing the use of corticosteroids can be driven, the consensus treatment guidelines [ 22 ] should be followed [ 44 ] , although there is no clear evidence on the route, dose, and duration of this treatment.",

IVIG proved to decrease aPL titers and therefore, the thrombotic risk of these patients [ 49 , 50 ] . However, IVIG and plasma exchanges were found few years ago to be a useful complementary tool for the treatment of patients with CAPS [ 51 ] . Their high economic cost and low availability may limit their use in patients with CAPS [ 52 ] . In this sense, an algorithm for the treatment of CAPS was published in order to guide physician facing these patients and establish treatment priorities [ 53 ] . This algorithm proposed to start specifi c treatment by handling independently each one of the main pathologic pathways. The authors recommended starting on anticoagulation and steroids as soon as the catastrophic situation is suspected. The former is given in order to stop the thrombophilic state and promote clot lysis and the later to downregulate the cytokine storm thought to be the one responsible for SIRS. When the patient is thought to be in a life-threatening condition, the authors suggested adding treatment with IVIG and/or plasma exchanges [ 53 ] . In case of active lupus manifestations, treatment with cyclophosphamide should be considered due to the better prognosis of these when they are treated with this drug. Cyclophosphamide is a nitrogen mustard-alkylating agent that binds to deoxyribonucleic acid in immune cells leading to cell death. Cyclophosphamide, probably, promotes the proliferation of T cells, suppression of helper Th1 activity, and enhances Th2 response (Fig. 20.1 ) [ 54 ] .",
