Based on the experience from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, HCWs were vulnerable to skin and mucosa barrier breakdown due to frequent cleansing and long\u2010term use of personal protective equipment (PPE).

Over\u2010tight using cannot enhance the protective effect but damage the skin and generate fogs instead.Management of skin indentation: Most mild skin indentation can regress spontaneously. Therapeutic measures for redness and swelling include hydropathic compress with three to four layers of gauze soaked by cold water or normal saline for about 20 minutes each time every 2 to 3 hours and then applying moisturizers. Avoid washing with over\u2010heated water, ethanol or other irritative products.Management of severe skin indentation: To avoid infection secondary to severely swollen or blistered and erosive lesions, hydropathic compress with povidone iodine diluted by normal saline at a ratio of 1:9 can be used on face. 3% boric acid solution is better on hands. It is encourage to apply medical dressing after hydropathic compress. Application of moisturizers on intact skin and topical antibiotic ointments such as compound polymyxin B, mupirocin, or fusidic acid on infected skin is recommended.\n",
