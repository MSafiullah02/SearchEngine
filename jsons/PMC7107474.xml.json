R406 is a specific, ATP-competitive inhibitor of Syk, the essential adaptor of CLR pathway [29]. Caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765, a commonly used inhibitor for NLR signaling, is used for comparison [30]. MTT assay was used to detect the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of each inhibitor in MDMs (Supplementary Figure 1), to ensure that the concentrations used for inhibition of PRRs have no adverse effect on macrophage viability. Based on the effective concentration of each inhibitor and its CC50, the indicated working concentrations (Figure 1A) were used throughout the study.",

Consistent with our previous observation, MERS-CoV infection globally stimulated an array of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1, RANTES, IFN-\u03b3, and IP-10 [8]. The induction of cytokine and/or chemokine was dependent on viral replication because the inoculation of the UV-inactivated viruses was unable to trigger these inflammatory mediators, except RANTES (Supplementary Figure 2). It is notable that MERS-CoV-mediated induction of TNF-\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, and IP-10 was generally diminished in the presence of Amlexanox and R406, although Amlexanox treatment only marginally reduced TNF-\u03b1 production. In addition, the treatment of Amlexanox, but not R406, significantly attenuated the induction of IL-6 and RANTES. However, NLR signaling inhibitor VX-765 seemed to have minimal effect on these inflammatory mediators. Because the replication of MERS-CoV is the driving force for the induction of most cytokines and/or chemokines, we evaluated the viral replication in the presence of the inhibitors. It was shown that the addition of these inhibitors did not affect viral replication (Supplementary Figure 3).",

Among CLRs, Dectin-1, Dectin-2, and Mincle are highly expressed in myeloid cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells [17]. Thus, we measured the mRNA profiles of RLRs and myeloid CLRs in MERS-CoV-infected macrophages. As shown in Figure 2A, the mRNA expression levels of RLRs including RIG-I, MDA5, and LPG2, as well as CLRs Mincle and Dectin-2 were significantly upregulated at 24 hpi. The positive modulation pattern of RLR and CLR, especially the increased expression of RIG-I and Mincle, was manifested as early as 6 hpi (Figure 2B), suggesting an accelerating activation of these PRRs during MERS-CoV infection. Overall, the above results suggested that RLR and CLR signaling might be involved in viral recognition and trigger the proinflammatory response upon MERS-CoV infection in macrophages.",

IP-10 secretion was readily detectable from both MERS-CoV-infected and mock-infected MDMs; whereas IFN-\u03b3 secretion was below the detection limit, even in the virus-infected cells.

Knockdown of RIG-I adaptor MAVS also marginally attenuated IP-10 production.

We then compared Mincle expression in NP+ cells versus that in NP\u2212 cells at 24 hpi.

It is notable that Mincle protein expression was significantly elevated in the NP+ cells (Figure 6B). Mincle upregulation in the virus-infected cells was verified by costaining of Mincle and NP.

To dissect the role of CARD9 in CLR signaling upon MERS-CoV infection, we examined CARD9 activation upon MERS-CoV infection or in the presence of the CLR inhibitor R406. As shown in Supplementary Figure 4, R406 had a negligible effect on CARD9 expression in the naive macrophages. However, CARD9 was significantly upregulated in MERS-CoV-infected macrophages. In contrast to the mock-infected cells, inhibition of CLR signaling by R406 significantly suppressed the degree of CARD9 activation.

It has been recognized that the rapid viral replication in lung tissues, massive inflammation, and elevated proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine response collectively contribute to acute lung injury and underlie the high pathogenicity of this life-threatening human CoV [2, 5, 34, 38]. The postmortem examination of MERS-CoV patient\u2019s lung tissues, which were obtained by needle sampling shortly after death, revealed severe pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage and mixed inflammatory cell infiltration. Immunostaining revealed numerous intra-alveolar macrophages and infiltrating T lymphocytes in the parenchyma [4], which are consistent with the histopathological changes in lung tissues of MERS-CoV-infected marmosets. It is notable that profound macrophage proliferation was the most prominent pathological change in the postmortem examination of lung tissues of fatal SARS patients [39]. It was postulated that the proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines released from the proliferative alveolar macrophages play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of SARS [40\u201342]. We have reported that MERS-CoV can productively infect human macrophages and trigger exuberant proinflammatory response [8]. It is conceivable that the proliferating macrophages in lung tissue of a MERS patient and the dysregulated immune response in these cells may contribute significantly to the high pathogenicity of MERS-CoV.",

Mincle is known to associate noncovalently with the adaptor molecule FcR\u03b3. The phosphorylation of the adaptor serves to recruit Syk and induces downstream NF-\u03baB activation through the Syk-CARD9-BCL10-MALT1 complex. The in vivo genetic studies have revealed an essential role of CLR-triggered CARD9 signaling in host protection. CARD9-deficient mice exhibited deregulated innate responses and failed to control infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [43]. In addition, Mincle was identified as a lipopolysaccharide-inducible protein in mouse macrophages and was transcriptionally upregulated after exposed to various stimuli and cellular stress [44]. In human monocytes, fungus infection elevated Mincle expression [31]. In this study, we demonstrated that MERS-CoV replication upregulated Mincle expression. The antibody blockage of Mincle, siRNA depletion of Mincle, Syk pharmacological inhibition, and CARD9 activation invariably highlighted the role of Mincle for mediating the proinflammatory cascade in MERS-CoV-infected macrophages.",

The cooperative detection by different PRRs has been reported in other DNA and RNA viruses [33, 45] and bacteria [46]. In rhinovirus-infected bronchial epithelial cells, the innate immune response requires a coordinated recognition, initially via TLR3 or TRIF and followed by RNA helicases RIG-I and MDA5 [33]. Our results indicate that CLR and RLR signaling may be involved in mediating the immune activation in MERS-CoV-infected human macrophages. However, the possible crosstalk or coordination of different pathways has yet to be investigated.",

In agreement with previous literature on other human CoVs, our data revealed the important role of RLRs in mediating the proinflammatory response upon MERS-CoV infection. More important, our study further investigated the involvement of CLRs in sensing MERS-CoV and provided the first evidence that CLRs contributed to the recognition of MERS-CoV. In addition, we demonstrated that a significant proportion of MERS-CoV-triggered proinflammatory response was governed by Mincle. In this regard, CLRs may play an important role in modulating the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV.",
