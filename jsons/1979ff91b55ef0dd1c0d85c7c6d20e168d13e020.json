            "text": "Pollination of Neotropical dioecious trees is commonly related to generalist insects. Similar data for non-tree species with separated genders are inconclusive. Recent studies on pollination of dioecious Chamaedorea palms (Arecaceae) suggest that species are either insect-or wind-pollinated. However, the wide variety of inflorescence and floral attributes within the genus suggests mixed pollination mode involving entomophily and anemophily. To evaluate this hypothesis, we studied the pollination of Chamaedorea costaricana, C. macrospadix, C. pinnatifrons and C. tepejilote in two montane forests in Costa Rica. A complementary morphological analysis of floral traits was carried out to distinguish species groups within the genus according to their most probable pollination mechanism. We conducted pollinator exclusion experiments, field observations on visitors to pistillate and staminate inflorescences, and trapped airborne pollen. A cluster analysis using 18 floral traits selected for their association with wind and insect pollination syndromes was carried out using 52 Chamaedorea species. Exclusion experiments showed that both wind and insects, mostly thrips (Thysanoptera), pollinated the studied species. Thrips used staminate inflorescences as brood sites and pollinated pistillate flowers by deception. Insects caught on pistillate inflorescences transported pollen, while traps proved that pollen is windborne. Our empirical findings clearly suggest that pollination of dioecious Chamaedorea palms is likely to involve both insects and wind. A cluster analysis showed that the majority of studied species have a combination of floral traits that allow for both pollination modes. Our pollination experiments and morphological analysis both suggest that while some species may be completely entomophilous or anemophilous, ambophily might be a common condition within Chamaedorea. Our results propose a higher diversity of pollination mechanisms of Neotropical dioecious species than previously suggested.",

Knowledge of the pollination systems in Chamaedorea has relied on observations of flower visitors and floral morphology that tentatively assigned species to an entomophilous (insect) or anemophilous (wind) system (see references in Henderson 1986) . Empirical studies on the pollination of Chamaedorea are relatively recent and only comprise around 6% of all the species. Results thus far have tended to categorise species as either entomophilus or anemophilous. Anemophily has been suggested for Chamaedorea pinnatifrons (Jacq.) \u00d8erst. (Listabarth 1993) , Chamaedorea alternans H. Wendl. (Otero-Arnaiz & Oyama 2001) and Chamaedorea radicalis Mart. (Berry & Gorchov 2004) , while entomophily has been suggested for C. ernesti-augusti H.

Listabarth (1993) observed small thrips (Thysanoptera) and beetles (Coleoptera) visiting staminate inflorescences of C. pinnatifrons, but insects were rarely seen in pistillate flowers. Listabarth (1993) proposed that the insect's activity facilitated the release of pollen from flowers where wind could more easily transport it to pistillate flowers, in a system he named 'insect-induced wind pollination'. Otero-Arnaiz & Oyama (2001) also classified C. alternans as windpollinated, however reported activity of thrips on staminate inflorescences. Conversely, Porter-Morgan (2007) argued that thrips were the main pollinator of four Chamaedorea species and gave wind a secondary role. These authors, however, did not consider the possibility of a mixed pollination syndrome.",

Bags covered the inflorescences for 6-8 weeks after anthesis to reduce fruit loss due to predation. Fruits were counted when they had reached nearly one-third of their final size.",

In all four studied species and reproductive years, the control treatment produced consistently more fruits than the insect exclusion treatment alone (all P-values <0.001 after Mann-Whitney test). Fruit set from insectexcluded inflorescences varied among species and flowering seasons, from nearly 7% in C. pinnatifrons to 22% in C. tepejilote (Fig. 1) . Within species, fruit set from wind pollination was significantly higher than fruit set from apomixis in most cases (Mann-Whitney test P < 0.001, except in C. tepejilote in 2005-2006 and C. macrospadix in 2011 P > 0.05). Pollen caught on pollen traps confirmed that wind transports Chamaedorea pollen (Fig. 2) . A mean of 86 AE 11 (AESD) pollen grains per trap was counted at El Rodeo, while at La Carpintera, we found 16 AE 4 grains per trap.

Species in groups 1 and 3 (Fig. 4) have a prevalence of traits more conducive to wind and insect pollination, respectively. In group 1, species exhibited inflorescences with long peduncles (traits C and D), many rachillae (traits G and H), flowers not showy (traits K and L), exposed and divided stigmas (traits M and N) and exerted anthers (trait O); these traits are congruent or suggest anemophily.

While some Chamaedorea species may be completely entomophilous or anemophilous, most analysed species have floral traits that simultaneously allow for the transport of pollen by both vectors, a system termed 'ambophily' (reviewed in Culley et al. 2002) .

            "text": "Our field experiments suggest that thrips (Order Thysanoptera) mainly carry out entomophilous pollination in the studied Chamaedorea spp. However, the role of other visiting insects cannot be discounted because pollination studies in the literature barely include 6% of all Chamaedorea spp. Also, other insect groups might pollinate species with wide geographic distribution or those found in diverse habitats (Herrera et al. 2006) . Thrips have been considered unreliable pollinators due to their limited flight ability and their apparently low specialisation for hosts (Kirk 1985a (Kirk , 1997 , but they appear to be effective pollinators in our study sites. The thrips pollination system in Chamaedorea fits the brood-site type of 'pollen parasites' described by Sakai (2002) and discussed by Porter-Morgan (2007) . Insects are probably attracted to the scented staminate flowers (Kirk 1985b ) even before anthesis, where they mate and feed on pollen and plant tissue and oviposit within the small flowers. Most of the 52 Chamaedorea species analysed (96%) had scented staminate flowers. Consumption of vegetal tissue was more evident on staminate inflorescences, particularly in C. tepejilote; this consumption might be related to a low amount of anatomical defences. The increasing number of juvenile thrips found on drying staminate inflorescences indicates that immature insects develop on senescent flowers within a few days. Later, juvenile insects probably fall to the soil to complete their development (Lewis 1973) . We found that thrips indeed transported pollen on their bodies, and volatile compounds (mainly sesquiterpenoids in C. tepejilote; Kaiser 1997) probably attract them to the pistillate flowers. Nonetheless, in our floral trait analysis only 31% of the species had scented pistillate flowers, which suggests that if thrips are the main pollinators of most of the analysed Chamaedorea, they also might locate pistillate flowers through visual cues. Pollen deposition onto the stigma of pistillate flowers of Chamaedorea is likely mediated by a 'mistake mechanism' (Dafni 1984) . Pistillate flowers are morphologically similar to their staminate counterparts and imitate the oviposition substrate. However, they do not provide a brood site inside the small pistillate flowers with reduced perianth parts and lack pollen as food. Also, and although not studied here, septal nectaries to provide nectar as reward have not been detected in flowers of Chamaedorea (Askgaard et al. 2008) . Pollination occurs when thrips arrive at pistillate flowers and do not stay for a long time, explaining the observed lower number of insects on pistillate inflorescence compared to staminate inflorescences. Before leaving, their activity on the inflorescence provides the opportunity for pollen to be deposited on the exposed stigmas and to develop the one-seeded fruit. Alternatively, pistillate inflorescences might inhibit thrips oviposition or larval development due to a possible larger anatomical defences (Uhl & Moore 1973) or active inhibition of larval development (Dufa\u20ac y & Anstett 2004) .",

While thrips are occasionally mentioned as flower visitors, their potential role as palm pollinators has not been fully recognised (Kirk 1997; Barfod et al. 2011) . Some previous pollination studies in Chamaedorea may have overlooked the importance of thrips. For instance, the supposedly anemophilous C. alternans (Otero-Arnaiz & Oyama 2001) might also experience entomophily because the authors reported large amounts of thrips on staminate inflorescences. Listabarth (1993) suggested an indirect role of thrips in the pollination of C. pinnatifrons; however, our observations show that thrips have a direct role in pollen transport to pistillate flowers. The role of thrips as pollinators is documented in several plant groups with different taxonomic affinities, such as Zamiaceae (Mound & Terry 2001) , Annonaceae (Gottsberger 1994; Momose et al. 1998) , Dipterocarpaceae (Appanah & Chan 1981; Kondo et al. 2011) , Euphorbiaceae (Fiala et al. 2011) , Moraceae (Sakai 2001; Zerega et al. 2004 ) and Ericaceae (Hagerup & Hagerup 1953; Garc \u0131a-Fayos & Goldarazena 2008) .",

            "text": "In our study sites, anemophily appears to contribute significantly to the pollination biology of Chamaedorea. Initially, palms were considered anemophilous due to their floral morphology (i.e. small flowers, high pollen-ovule ratio and small pollen grains), but this view has changed to consider palms as mainly entomophilous (Henderson 1986; Barfod et al. 2011) ; however, several studies have documented the role of insects and wind in palm pollination (Anderson et al. 1988; Scariot et al. 1991; Consiglio & Bourne 2001; Melendez-Ramirez et al. 2004) . Our pollination experiments showed that fruit set in the studied Chamaedorea species is the result of a mixed pollination system. In addition to thrips, Chamaedorea pollen grains can also be wind-transported, as our pollen trapping experiment documented. Pollen release from the anthers in species with apically connate petals, such as C. pinnatifrons, might occur by spontaneous means and not necessarily need the intervention of thrips, as Listabarth (1993) suggested. Consequently, for species like C. tepejilote and C. costaricana with apically separated petals, pollen release into the wind is easily achieved without insect intervention. Pollen movement by wind in Chamaedorea can be a common phenomenon, even in the relatively low-wind forest understorey, because the majority (85%) of the species selected for our analysis of floral traits possessed dry and powdery, easily wind-transported pollen.",

Having a dual mixed pollination system is expected to increase the reproductive success of plants (Costa & Machado 2012) and therefore may represent a selective advantage. This enhanced success is particularly important for species in conditions where insect pollinators are scarce or species compete for pollinators (references in Culley et al. 2002) . The effectiveness of both pollination systems in Chamaedorea is also likely to depend on floral traits that are adapted to both wind and insect pollination (Yamasaki & Sakai 2013 ) and very likely vary according to species, habitat and flowering season (Culley et al. 2002) . In our study species, wind pollination significantly contributed to overall fruit set. We are however likely to underestimate the role of wind because the bag itself probably reduced somewhat the inflow of wind-borne pollen (Kearns & Inouye 1993 ). In the ambophilous palm Attalea speciosa Mart. ex Spreng. (studied as Orbignya phalerata Mart.), anemophily was more important in open sites or pastures compared to forest conditions (Anderson et al. 1988) . In Cocos nucifera L., ambophily is recognised but the relative importance of wind and insect as pollen vectors might depend on wind conditions (Melendez-Ramirez et al. 2004) . In Chamaedorea, ambophily may also contribute to long-distance pollen dispersal because thrips dispersal might be limited (Kondo et al. 2011) .",

In our analyses, however, most species showed a combination of characters from both pollination mechanisms, which may favour ambophily. In fact, three of our study species are clustered in a group with species having both anemophilous and entomophilous floral traits. However, C. macrospadix was placed by the cluster analysis in a group with floral characters adapted for anemophily, while our pollination experiments showed that insect pollination played an important role. In this species both staminate and pistillate flowers are scented, which may promote insect visitation. In addition, the flowering period of C. macrospadix in our study population comprises the second peak of the rainy season, which may constraint the role of wind pollination (data not shown). This also indicates that the classification suggested by our morphological analysis needs to be confirmed empirically through pollination studies.",

As dioecious species, Chamaedorea palms are more sensitive to the detrimental effects of habitat disturbance, deforestation and fragmentation on breeding dynamics (Somanathan & Borges 2000) . Information on the breeding system is necessary for the development of efficient conservation strategies, because they impact gene flow patterns, which in turn affect levels of genetic diversity and population structure (Loveless & Hamrick 1984) . This study aimed to increase knowledge about the pollination of this palm group, while trying to elucidate the existence of complex pollination mechanisms. Moreover, our results show a higher diversity in pollination mechanisms of Neotropical dioecious species than previously suggested by other authors (e.g. Bawa & Opler 1975; Renner & Ricklefs 1995) . We clearly show ambophily as the most likely pollination system for the four studied Chamaedorea species in Costa Rica. Future research directions on this topic might evaluate the role of both pollination mechanisms along a habitat or geographical gradient or in isolated populations in forest fragments. respectively; Paul Hanson (University of Costa Rica), Angel Sol \u0131s (National Institute of Biodiversity, INBIO) and Laurence A.
