While this clinical spectrum is well documented, its immunologic underpinnings are less clear. We have therefore initiated studies of the B cell responses as they would participate in both early effector responses and in the initiation of memory formation. In terms of effector responses, we were particularly interested in the engagement and clinical correlates of the extra-follicular pathway (EF) we recently described in flaring SLE 5 . In this systemic autoimmune disease, the EF pathway is initiated by newly activated na\u00efve B cell (aN) leading to large expansion of autoantibody-producing antibody-secreting cells through the generation of an epigenetically primed B cell precursor which are double negative (DN) for na\u00efve (IgD) and memory markers (CD27) and lacking expression of CXCR5 and CD21 (DN2) 6, 7, 8 . These highly activated D2 cells are also distinguished by high expression of CD11c and T-bet and are TLR7-driven. Both TLR7-stimulation which is triggered by ssRNA and the central role played by their murine counterparts (typically characterized as Age-Associated B cells), in viral clearance, strongly supported the hypothesis that DN2 cells and the global EF pathway could be prominently engaged in COVID-19 patients 9 . Also of note, EF B cell activation is particularly prominent in SLE patients of African-American ancestry, a population disproportionately represented in severe COVID-19 6, 9 .",

This patient cluster associates tightly with biomarkers of poor outcomes and exhibits high rates of mortality. Thus, this B cell phenotype might serve as an immunological marker of severe COVID-19 infection at early stages and could therefore identify a patient subset likely to benefit from targeted immunomodulatory therapy aimed at alleviating disease burden. : medRxiv preprint 3 of COVID-19 + patient ASCs revealed a significant increase over healthy controls (Fig 1d) , and substantial ASC maturation as indicated by high expression of the plasma cell marker CD138 (Fig 1e) . Counterintuitively, while ASC generation and maturation are often correlates of protection in vaccine responses 22 , in patients with COVID-19 increased ASC instead portended negative disease outcomes with ICU-admitted patients presenting with significantly more ASCs than their HD and outpatient counterparts (Fig 1f) .",

Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 clustered independently from healthy controls, driven primarily by a population cluster containing ASCs and constituents of the extrafollicular (EF) response pathway such as active naive (aN) and double negative 2 (DN2) cells 17 (Fig 1c) . Direct assessment 4 EF pathway enrichment was notable with concomitant decrease of the transitional B cells, particularly a unique CD21 lo population making up as much as 10% of the total CD19+ B cells in the Tr-COV2 cluster (Fig   2a, 3a-d) . Surprisingly, while these cells shared several of the phenotypic markers of B cell immaturity such as high levels of CD10 and CD38 (Fig 3e) , they also expressed high levels of surface IgM with muted surface IgD (Fig 3f) , expression of the extrafollicular homing cues (Fig 3g) , and an increased expression of the plasma cell marker CD138 (Fig 3h) . In SLE, previous studies have identified the direct conversion of transitional B cell populations into ASCs in a polyclonal, autoreactive, and TLR-7 dependent manner 29 . Assessment of our SLE cohort revealed that while transitional populations were frequently decreased in comparison to healthy donors, CD21 lo transitional cell proportions were similar to COVID-19 + patients (Fig 3i) . Yellow Fever vaccinated patients show similar skewing, peaking at d12 post-vaccination (Fig 3j-k) . Alongside previous identification in HIV viremia 30 , these data suggest that this population may routinely emerge during ssRNA-antiviral responses. Due to their unique phenotype and association with mild disease, it will be important in future studies to fully characterize these cells and understand their impact on the clinical course of infection.",

            "text": "To contextualize differences in clinical trajectory between the EF-CoV and Tr-CoV clusters, longitudinal data was collected from two patients within each cohort. All four were African American, and admitted to the ICU (Fig 4a) . While all of the patients displayed ASC expansion, the two from the EF-CoV cohort displayed consistently low levels of transitional B cells (Fig 4b-c ). These B cell subset parameters were associated with elevated Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores (a marker of critical illness severity), and a corresponding decrease in PaO2 to FiO2 ratios -a prognostic measure of gas exchange efficiency while on mechanical ventilation (Fig 4d-e) . Additionally, these patients displayed elevated levels of C-reactive protein levels in the blood over their Tr-CoV counterparts (Fig 4f) . CRP, an acute phase reactant in the IL-6 pathway, has been increasingly used as a biomarker of COVID-19 severity 31, 32 . This trend in CRP values was generalizable, with blood CRP levels elevated across all critically ill SARS-CoV-2 patients, but particularly those within the IL-6-high EF-CoV cohort (Fig 4g) . Surprisingly, linear regression demonstrated that both the low frequency of transitional B cells and a high number of DN2 B cells across patients were correlated as strongly with CRP as IL-6 directly (Fig 4h-j) . Finally, as anticipated by their accumulation of poor prognostic 5 markers, patients within the EF-CoV group faced poor disease outcomes -EF-1 died on day 7 post-symptom onset and EF-2 was still critically ill as of day 24 post-symptom onset. More generally, this cohort suffered an exceptionally high disease burden with (5/6) experiencing kidney failure, 50% mortality and expected to rise.",

Whether this observation reflects the loss of B cell regulatory function as postulated in SLE and other auto-inflammatory disorders, remains to be elucidated 36 ; and 4. due to disease heterogeneity, immunomodulatory therapy such as IL-6 inhibition may have discordant effects on different patient groups. Finally, it will be critical to determine if, as in SLE, pre-disposition towards extrafollicular B-cell activation may be compounding with socio-economic factors to result in the poor infection outcomes observed in the African American population.",
