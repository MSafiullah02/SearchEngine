As lung volume increases and decreases with each\nbreath, the airways are subjected to forces that cause them to expand and contract,\nthereby stretching and retracting the airway smooth muscle within the bronchial\ntree. Airway smooth muscle is also periodically subjected to larger forces of\nexpansion caused by the intermittent deep breaths that occur during normal\nbreathing. The mechanical oscillations that occur during breathing are\nwell-documented to have profound effects on airway tone and airway responsiveness in\nboth humans and experimental animals [1\u201312].",

Increasing the volume of tidal breath oscillations results in airway\ndilation and an increase in airway caliber, whereas a decrease in the oscillation\nvolume leads to airway constriction [11,13] (Fig. 1). The absence of periodic deep breaths during\nnormal breathing results in airway hyper-reactivity in experimental animals and in\nhuman subjects [8,11]. The continual stretch and retraction of airway smooth\nmuscle during tidal breathing is also critical for maintaining normal airway\nreactivity in vivo [7]. Thus, the mechanical\nmodulation of airway responsiveness during normal breathing is a fundamental\nphysiologic property of the airways that is important for the maintenance of a low\nlevel of airway reactivity during breathing in vivo. The adaptive effects of stretch\nmay account for the dilatory effect of tidal volume oscillations and deep\ninspiration on the airways.",

Volume or\npressure oscillations imposed on isolated bronchial segments in vitro after they are\nstimulated to contract result in dilation of the bronchi [13] (Fig. 2). Similarly,\nlength or force oscillations imposed on isolated contracted airway smooth muscle\ntissues lead to relaxation [23,26]. Periodic stretches imposed on isolated\nairway tissues also result in their temporary relaxation, although, in the absence\nof further stretches, the muscle eventually redevelops contractile tone if is\nreturned to its shorter length and maintained at a constant length [18,28]. The property by which airway smooth muscle modulates its\ncontractile and mechanical properties to accommodate to changes in its mechanical\nenvironment has been termed \u201cmechanical plasticity\u201d or \u201clength\nadaptation\u201d [21,29,30].

The length-history dependence of the\ncontractile properties of airway smooth muscle provide an illustration of this\nproperty [18,20,21,23\u201326,28,32\u201337]. For\nexample, when isolated tracheal smooth muscle tissues are maintained at a constant\nmuscle length for a period of time and then shortened, a depression of tension\nredevelopment and shortening velocity at the shorter length is observed (Fig. 3). The amount of force depression is\nproportional to the size of the shortening step [21,28,34,35]. This\ndepression occurs whether the shortening step is imposed on the muscle prior to or\nduring contractile stimulation. Conversely, if the muscle is maintained at a short\nlength for a period of time and then stimulated to contract, both tension\ndevelopment and shortening velocity are higher than if these parameters are measured\nimmediately after shortening to that length [18,34,35]. Similar properties have been reported for other smooth\nmuscle tissue types and for single smooth muscle cells [38\u201340],\nsuggesting that this adaptive behavior may be a fundamental characteristic of smooth\nmuscle cells.",

            "text": "The adaptive changes that are observed when airway muscles are maintained at\ndifferent lengths are manifest not only as changes in their contractile dynamics but\nalso as alterations in tissue stiffness [18,21,40]. Tracheal smooth muscle strips are significantly stiffer\nand less extensible after isometric contraction at a short muscle length than after\nisometric contraction at a long length, suggesting that the structure of the smooth\nmuscle cell changes when it is activated at different lengths [21,34]. The\nincreased stiffness that results from contracting a muscle at a short length can be\nreversed simply by stretching the muscle to a longer length, which is consistent\nwith the hypothesis that stretch induces structural rearrangements in the muscle\n[18,21]. According to this hypothesis, activation of the muscle at a short\nlength would lead the contractile filaments to organize into a short, thick filament\narray adapted to the shorter, thicker shape of the muscle cell, whereas activation\nat a long length would result in the organization of the contractile filaments into\na long thin array adapted to the longer, thinner shape of the muscle cell. Stretch\nof the muscle to a long length after activation at a short length would result in\nreorganization of the cytoskeleton to accommodate to the change in shape of the\nmuscle cell caused by the stretch. If contractile activation at different lengths\nresults in such changes in contractile filament organization, the muscle should be\nstiffer and less extensible after contractile activation at a short length than\nafter it is activated at a long length. The stiffness would also be predicted to\ndecrease when the contracted muscle is stretched from a short length to a long\nlength [18,21,40]. There is\nsubstantial evidence that these \u201cplastic\u201d or length-adaptive\nproperties of airway smooth muscle underlie the mechanical properties of the airways\nthat are critical for the normal regulation of airway tone [2,21,31,41].",

            "text": "The contraction of smooth muscle cells has long been attributed to the activation\nof smooth muscle myosin ATPase activity and crossbridge cycling (Fig. 5(b)). This process is\nactivated by Ca2+-calmodulin regulated myosin light chain\n(MLC) kinase, which regulates the phosphorylation of the 20 KD light chain of\nsmooth muscle myosin. Myosin light chain phosphorylation promotes the\nactin-activated ATPase activity of the myosin head, which catalyzes crossbridge\ncycling and acto-myosin filament sliding [59\u201362]. However,\nstudies performed in airway smooth muscle tissues have established that the\nactivation of myosin and crossbridge cycling is not sufficient by itself to\naccount for shortening and tension development in response to the contractile\nstimulation of smooth muscle [42,43,63]. The contractile stimulation of airway and other smooth muscle\ntissues also regulates the polymerization of a pool of actin, and the process of\nactin polymerization is also required for tension development to occur [46,47,58,63\u201375].\nMechanisms for the regulation of actin polymerization and its role in regulating\nactivation of the contractile apparatus and tension development have been\nanalyzed extensively in these tissues. The inhibition of either actin\npolymerization or of MLC phosphorylation in airway smooth muscle tissues\ndepresses tension development in response to stimulation with ACh. However, the\ninhibition of actin polymerization using either molecular or pharmacologic\napproaches has little or no effect on the increase in MLC phosphorylation in\nresponse to agonist stimulation [63,67,71,75].\nConversely, agonist-induced actin polymerization is not suppressed when MLC\nphosphorylation is inhibited [71].\nThus, in airway smooth muscle, actin polymerization and smooth muscle MLC\nphosphorylation are distinct cytoskeletal processes that are independently\nregulated during contractile stimulation (Fig. 5).",

N-WASp activation is directly and specifically\nregulated by the binding of the small GTPase cdc42 to its CRIB (Cdc42- and\nRac-interactive binding) domain [82,84\u201386].

            "text": "The activation of airway smooth muscle results in the rapid recruitment and\nassembly of multiple proteins into adhesome complexes [44,46,47,52,72,73,75,81]. The time course of adhesome protein\nrecruitment is rapid and can be visualized in dissociated cells and intact\nairway smooth muscle tissues by immunofluorescence techniques and proximity\nligation assays, and in living or fixed dissociated cells expressing green\nfluorescent protein constructs of adhesome proteins [44,47,73,75,91]. Paxillin, focal\nadhesion kinase (FAK), vinculin, and multiple other components of\nintegrin-associated signaling complexes are recruited to adhesome complexes in\nresponse to external stimulation where they undergo phosphorylation and\nactivation [14,15,44,47,81,92]. The recruitment and\nactivation of vinculin, paxillin, and other adhesome proteins is required for\nagonist-stimulated actin polymerization and contraction in airway smooth muscle\n[44,46,47,52,69,72,81,93]. Many of\nthese proteins, including paxillin, vinculin, and FAK, are sensitive to\nmechanical stimulation: their activation in the airway smooth muscle tissues is\nregulated by external mechanical forces imposed on the tissues as well as by\ncontractile stimulation [14,15,47,94]. Paxillin and\nvinculin exist in the cytoplasm in a stable inactive complex and are recruited\nto adhesome complexes in response to external stimulation, where paxillin is\nactivated by FAK [47,81]. After recruitment, vinculin\nundergoes phosphorylation on its tail domain at tyrosine 1065: the\nphosphorylation of vinculin at this site regulates its conversion to an open\nligand binding conformation that enables it to bind to talin and F actin as well\nas to other proteins involved in cytoskeletal dynamics [47,81]. Higher\nlevels of mechanical strain increase the phosphorylation of FAK, paxillin and\nvinculin, and provide a mechanism for the mechanosensitive regulation of\nsignaling pathways mediated by these proteins [14,15,95]. In airway smooth muscle, the assembly and activation\nof adhesome complexes is a necessary prerequisite to the process of cortical\nactin polymerization; thus the process of actin polymerization can be regulated\nin a mechanosensitive fashion.",

Nonmuscle myosin II is\nubiquitously expressed in all cell types and constitutes the primary motor for\nmotility, migration and adhesion in nonmuscle cells. Airway smooth muscle\ncontains a pool of nonmuscle myosin II, which localizes primarily to the\ncortical region of the airway smooth muscle cell [52]. NM myosin II is present in the airway smooth muscle\nin both monomeric and filamentous form [52]. Monomeric myosin II exists in an inactive folded conformation\nthat is unable to assemble into filaments [52,98,99]. The contractile stimulation of airway smooth muscle\ntissues with ACh regulates the assembly of nonmuscle myosin II filaments as well\nas their activation by catalyzing a conformational change in the myosin II\nmonomer that enables it to assemble into filaments. This process is required for\nthe recruitment of vinculin, paxillin, and FAK to membrane adhesion complexes in\nresponse to a contractile stimulus [52].",
