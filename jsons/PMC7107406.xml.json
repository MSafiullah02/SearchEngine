She initially did well, but was hospitalized 8 weeks after transplantation with symptoms of malaise, anorexia, fever, and abdominal complaints (including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and food intolerance). She lived in the country near to a city, but was not employed in agriculture, and there was no evidence of contact with animals in her clinical history. Gastroscopic examination showed no abnormalities. Infiltrative lesions in the thorax were detected by radiological and computed tomographic examinations, and there was progressive swelling of cervical lymph nodes. No pathogens were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens (virus culture on HEL, LLC-MK2, HEp-2, and human rhabdomyosarcoma cells; bacterial culture on blood agar, chocolate agar, Columbia blood agar containing colistin and nalidixic acid, and Sabouraud agar; cytological examination for bacteria, fungi, and Pneumocystis carinii), and a biopsy of the peripheral right lower lung lobe was histologically normal. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigen expression and lymphoproliferation were detected in a biopsy of the right jugular lymph node, and a blood sample was positive for EBV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Reactivation of EBV and associated lymphoproliferation were treated successfully with rituximab (anti-CD20) and discontinuation of cyclosporin therapy, but other clinical signs remained. Enteroscopic examination of the small intestine showed no abnormalities, and no pathogens were detected in fecal samples by bacterial culture.",

Two weeks later, the patient developed respiratory failure. There was crepitation over both lung fields and bilateral, progressively expanding, blotchy infiltrates in the thorax by radiological examination. Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria (Pseudomonas species) were detected by microscopic examination of BAL fluid, and treatment with ceftazidime and tobramycin was initiated. Despite intubation and artificial respiration at increasing pressure, respiratory function deteriorated further and circulatory failure developed. Artificial respiration was stopped after 3 days, after which the patient died.",

The mucosa of the colon ascendens was lined by a hemorrhagic exudate, but autolysis was too advanced to confirm or rule out graft-vs-host disease, and no satisfactory explanation was found for the abdominal complaints. In conclusion, the progressive respiratory failure was explained by severe diffuse alveolar damage of undetermined cause, and extensive bilateral bronchopneumonia caused by terminal Pseudomonas species infection.",

These samples included human rhabdomyosarcoma cells inoculated with a BAL specimen collected in 2002 from the above patient. Metagenomic analysis revealed the presence of short nucleotide fragments with homology to APMV-1. To complete the genome of the clinical isolate, fragments obtained through whole transcriptome amplification were assembled against the APMV-1 genome with the highest similarity (Supplementary Methods). In brief, the assembly was performed using Sequencher software (version 4.1; Gene Codes). Because the whole-transcriptome amplification fragments did not overlap into a complete genome, the assembly was used to design primers for genome walking, PCR assays were performed with these primers, and products were sequenced. These efforts resulted in the genome completion of the Dutch clinical virus isolate.",

Viruses in this genotype are also called pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1), because pigeons and doves are the animal reservoir.

Virus was transmitted to 1 of the 2 naive pigeons. None of the pigeons displayed clinical signs at any time point during the 3-week observation period. No gross lesions were observed in any pigeons at autopsy at 21 dpi. However, histopathological analysis showed that all 5 intratracheally inoculated pigeons plus the 1 infected naive pigeon had diffuse interstitial nonpurulent nephritis, which was absent in 2 negative control pigeons from the same flock (Supplementary Figure 2). Also, 1 inoculated pigeon had multifocal nonpurulent pancreatitis. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that hPPMV-1/NL/579/2003 was present in the kidney sample of 3 inoculated pigeons with nephritis, and in the pancreas sample of 2 inoculated pigeons, including the 1 with pancreatitis (Supplementary Figure 3).",
