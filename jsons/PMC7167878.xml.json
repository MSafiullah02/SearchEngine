Post\u2010RT surveillance of BK virus is commonly done at most transplant centers. BK viremia similarly is more common in the early post\u2010RT period due to intense immunosuppression.2 Untreated, BK viremia can progress to BKVAN, leading to transplant dysfunction.3 Although CMV infection is known to occur in association with TRAS,4 a concomitant BK viremia and TRAS has not been described. Here, we describe a 2\u2010year\u2010old girl who presented with such an association.",

She required temporary RRT in the form of PD from 2 weeks until 4 months of age. PD was discontinued at 4 months of age due to recurrent fungal peritonitis. She was able to maintain stable electrolytes with good urine output while off PD. At 2 years of age, she received a deceased donor kidney transplant from an adult donor. Donor kidney was 10 cm in length with a single renal artery and vein. KDPI was 33%. Her height was 80 cm (5th centile), and weight was 12 kg (50th centile) at the time of transplant. It was a five antigen mismatched kidney. Pretransplant hypercoagulable workup was negative. Allograft was placed intra\u2010abdominally. The donor renal artery was anastomosed with the recipient's aorta and the donor renal vein with the recipient's IVC via end\u2010to\u2010side anastomosis, using # 6\u20100 prolene suture. Bilateral native nephrectomies (right kidney 4 cm and left kidney 4.5 cm in length) were performed at the time of transplant to prevent dehydration episodes post\u2010RT as she was polyuric prior to transplant, and also, it was thought that the 10\u2010cm donor kidney would be little difficult to fit in this small patient. Intra\u2010operative event was otherwise unremarkable. No peri\u2010operative heparin was administered. Abdominal fascia was closed with # 2\u20100 PDS, and skin was closed with monocryl subcuticular suture. CIT was 8 hours and 38 minutes, and WIT was 49 minutes. There was an EBV and CMV mismatch (donor positive and recipient negative). She had an excision of her left parathyroid nodule 2 days prior to the transplant. A non\u2010contrast MRI of neck done for persistent hypercalcemia and phosphaturia with normophosphatemia, suppressed serum intact PTH, elevated PTHrp (50\u201060 pg/mL), and FGF 23, had shown a left parathyroid nodule. Histology of the excised tissue showed the presence of thymic tissue. Induction was done with thymoglobulin (total 4.5 mg/kg) and methylprednisolone.",

Serum creatinine remained at pretransplant level (~2.5\u20103 mg/dL). Doppler US of renal transplant showed poor blood flow, leading to emergency abdominal re\u2010exploration 6 hours post\u2010RT. An early thrombus was found at the renal artery tip for which she underwent thrombectomy, while the kidney was kept cold at back bench. An end\u2010to\u2010side re\u2010anastomosis of renal artery with the right common iliac artery was performed using # 6\u20100 prolene suture. Her abdomen was left open with a Gore\u2010Tex patch with mesh, and ioband was placed over the mesh. Post\u2010thrombectomy, she received heparin infusion and baby aspirin. Renal function remained deranged with dyselectrolytemias and elevated serum creatinine (peak 5 mg/dL), requiring initiation of HD. An open transplant kidney biopsy performed on POD 3 showed features of ATN without any rejection. MMF was started on POD 1 but initiation of tacrolimus was delayed due to DGF. Her urine output gradually improved, and by POD 14, dialysis was not required. On POD 19, the Gore\u2010Tex patch was removed and fascia was closed with # 2\u20100 PDS and skin closed with monocryl in a subcuticular fashion. She was discharged home on POD 21 on tacrolimus, MMF, steroid, and aspirin. Anti\u2010infective prophylaxis consisted of TMP\u2010SMX, valganciclovir, and nystatin. At 1 month post\u2010RT, she was started on amlodipine for mild asymptomatic hypertension. Ureteral stent was removed in 6 weeks. Serum trough tacrolimus levels remained at goal (8\u201010 ng/mL, as per our center's protocol) with intermittent elevation, requiring dose reduction.",

These episodes were managed with appropriate antibiotics, reduced immunosuppression, G\u2010CSF, and supportive measures. Aspirin was discontinued at 2 months due to development of spontaneous bruising. MMF was held at 2 months post\u2010RT due to severe neutropenia and BK viremia; the latter started at 2 months and peaked at 260 000 copies/mL (ARUP laboratories; normal: <390 copies/mL; quantitative PCR, serum) at 3 months post\u2010RT (Figure 1). Leflunomide 20 mg daily was started at 2 months. Renal function remained stable with baseline serum creatinine of 0.9\u20101 mg/dL. A transplant biopsy was not performed. There was no history of gross hematuria or hydronephrosis. CMV and EBV DNA PCR remained negative throughout. At 5 months post\u2010RT, she presented with hypertensive emergency and PRES, apparently following another episode of respiratory illness which was later found to be secondary to coronavirus and parainfluenza infection. Her medications included tacrolimus, prednisolone, TMP\u2010SMX, amlodipine, valganciclovir, and leflunomide. Serum trough tacrolimus level was 4 ng/mL, and serum creatinine was elevated at 1.4 mg/dL. Her average SBPs ranged from 160 to 180 mm Hg, despite multiple antihypertensives, including continuous nicardipine infusion. On the second day of admission, she developed generalized tonic\u2010clonic seizure, with a BP of 190/100 mm Hg. MRI brain showed changes consistent with PRES. Antihypertensive therapy was augmented with the combination of nicardipine infusion, hydralazine, carvedilol, clonidine, furosemide, amlodipine, losartan, and minoxidil. Echocardiogram showed mild\u2010to\u2010moderate LVH with LVMI of 178.85 g/m2.7. Doppler US of the allograft showed decreased resistive indices (0.4\u20100.5) with tardus parvus waveforms and no hydronephrosis. Duplex study of renal artery showed extremely elevated velocities at the proximal renal artery (ostial renal: 96, proximal renal: 720, mid renal: 128 and distal renal artery: 105 cm/s), confirming proximal TRAS. Renal function continued to worsen with peak serum creatinine of 3 mg/dL. Losartan was discontinued. Serum BK PCR load was 2510 copies/mL with negative CMV and EBV PCR. Urine BK PCR load was 3.1 million copies/mL. Urine cytology for decoy cells was not sent. Percutaneous transplant kidney biopsy showed mild but diffuse interstitial inflammation, heavier in medulla, with CD3\u2010positive lymphocytes and CD68 mononuclear cells associated with mild lymphocytic tubulitis and moderate IF/TA. There was no hemorrhage, edema, or endotheliitis. Peritubular C4d staining was negative. No definitive intranuclear inclusion was seen. Immunohistochemical stain for SV40 was positive in the epithelial cells of distal and proximal tubules. These changes were consistent with BKVAN which was treated with IVIG, increase in the dose of leflunomide to 30 mg daily, and cessation of tacrolimus. The clinical course was complicated by diuretic\u2010resistant oliguria and pulmonary edema, eventually requiring HD and mechanical ventilation. HD was discontinued a few days later with improved pulmonary function. However, the refractory hypertension persisted despite multiple antihypertensive agents. She underwent a conventional digital subtraction angiogram which showed a severe anastomotic stenosis (>95% occlusion) of the renal artery (Figure 2) and a preprocedural gradient of 50 mm Hg across the stenosis. Successful PTA with stenting (4 \u00d7 15 mm balloon mounted uncoated stent, Monorail Xience Sierra, Abbott laboratories) of the transplant renal artery was done, with immediate improvement of blood flow and gradient reduction to 18 mm Hg. BPs normalized within few hours with average SBPs of 100\u2010110 mm Hg with intermittent elevation to 120\u2010130 mm Hg. Repeat Doppler US showed normalization of resistive indices and normal\u2010appearing vascular waveforms. She was maintained on aspirin following stenting of the transplant renal artery. At the time of discharge, her serum creatinine was back to baseline at 1 mg/dL and BPs were controlled with 2 antihypertensives (amlodipine and clonidine). Other discharge medications included aspirin, prednisone, and low\u2010dose tacrolimus. Repeat echocardiogram showed decrease in LVMI to 105.86 g/m2.7. Follow\u2010up 10 months later showed stable baseline serum creatinine of 0.9\u20101 mg/dL and controlled BPs on two antihypertensive agents. Follow\u2010up Doppler renal transplant sonograms and duplex study of the renal artery showed normal waveforms and velocities, respectively. BK viremia resolved at 7 months post\u2010RT. Leflunomide was discontinued, and MMF was restarted.",

Although our patient had a high serum viral load, we did not initially perform a biopsy due to stable graft function. Performance of a renal biopsy is usually prompted by allograft dysfunction, but some studies suggest persistent BK viruria or viremia as appropriate indications as well.8 On the other hand, a higher rate of false\u2010negative biopsies may be encountered in the early stages of the disease when the parenchymal involvement is patchy.9 Cytopathic changes were not obvious in our biopsy, mostly due to the focal nature of the nephropathy10 and due to significant IF/TA.",

However, the presence of BK infection along with TRAS has not been described. The widely accepted pathogenesis of BKVAN is characterized by an ascending infection from the uroepithelial cells to high\u2010level viral replication in renal tubular epithelial cells leading to cellular loss and thereby denudation of the epithelial monolayer in the tubules. Virus then leaks into the tissue and bloodstream, and inflammatory cells infiltrate the interstitium leading to IF/TA.11 The vascular spread of the virus may lead to the dissemination of virus to other tissues.",

            "text": "Historically, polyomaviruses (BK, JC virus, and SV40) are known to infect urorenal epithelial and neural cells. However, subsequent reports have described BK virus to infect and be reactivated in other large number of target cells, including the ones affected by inflammation or ischemia reperfusion injury, predominantly in the immunocompromised host. Some of these other target tissues or organ systems include liver, retina, lung, salivary gland, peripheral blood leukocytes, human umbilical cord vein umbilical cells, pancreatic cells, heart, and skeletal muscle.12, 13, 14 BK virus has also been shown to have tropism for vascular endothelial cells and causes an immune response by upregulating the genes associated with cell proliferation.15 BK infection also activates the interferon signaling in the endothelial cells by increasing the mRNA levels of many interferon\u2010stimulated genes.15 Uptake of blood\u2010born BKV virus\u2010like particles by endothelial cells of liver sinusoids and renal vasa\u2010recta has been shown in animal studies.16 This indicates that endothelial cells might provide an initial immune defense against BKV infection. Furthermore, in vitro studies show that BK virus exhibits a prolonged viral protein expression (at least 2 months), low yield of infectious progeny, and delayed cell death and hence maintaining the antiviral defense in the endothelial cells.15 This does raise the possibility of role of BK virus in inducing vascular stenosis, especially with prior history of renal artery thrombosis, thrombectomy, re\u2010anastomosis, and possibly vascular injury, as in the case described in this report. Upregulation of cell proliferation genes from BK infection in the endothelial cells could lead to the production of granulation tissue, leading to stenosis of the renal artery. Indeed, ureteric stenosis is one of the known associations with BK infection, usually occurring 2\u20105 months post\u2010RT,17 which corresponds to the peak onset of BK virus reactivation in kidney transplant recipients. The most widely accepted theory is that the ureteric epithelium which is damaged by ischemia or inflammation supports the BK infection and then is replaced with a granulation tissue, leading to stenosis.18, 19 We are not able to provide a histological evidence of BK infection of the transplant renal artery due to the very invasive nature of the procedure and potential risks of procedure\u2010related complications.",

            "text": "In contrast, infected renal proximal tubular epithelial cells do not elicit an efficient innate immune response against BKV as the infection leads to the release of many progeny virions and loss of cell monolayer viability.20 Cytopathic effects of BK virus have also been demonstrated in podocytes, mesangial cells, and glomerular endothelial cells, along with the epithelial cells of bladder and urethra.15 This suggests that these cells do not mount an effective antiviral response, and this may contribute to glomerular inflammation and hemorrhagic cystitis in BKV infection.21 Due to the strong productive infection, the viral persistence is not maintained in these cells as opposed to the endothelial cells as described above. Hence, there seems to be a cell type\u2010specific response to BKV infection. The simultaneous occurrence of BK nephropathy and TRAS in this patient may be an example of such cell\u2010specific response (death of renal tubular cells and proliferation of renal artery endothelial cells).",

She did have renal artery thrombus (thought to be secondary to two back\u2010to\u2010back surgeries leading to intravascular volume depletion due to being on NPO status for prolonged time in the setting of polyuria, this was supported by the evidence of ATN in the biopsy) for which she underwent end\u2010to\u2010side re\u2010anastomosis after thrombectomy and that could have added further insult to the artery. End\u2010to\u2010side anastomosis has been reported in some studies as a risk factor for TRAS but has not been consistently demonstrated.25, 34 To the best of our knowledge, BK infection has not been shown to be a risk factor for TRAS but is possible given its effect on endothelial cells as outlined above. One of the drugs used in the treatment of BK infection, leflunomide, can cause cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis but its association with TRAS is unknown.35\n",
