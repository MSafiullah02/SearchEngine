The most recent illustration of this can be found in the \u201cSpanish\u201d influenza that swept the world between 1918 and 1919 and killed an estimated 40 million people: that is more than the total number of soldiers killed in World War I (Oxford et al., 2002). More recently, with the advent of SARS in 2003, public awareness has been increased about our collective vulnerability to pandemics. In particular, the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis had a profound impact on healthcare providers in Canada. Nurses, physicians, technicians, and aides all played a role in the struggle against SARS; however, nurses were predominant in this group. Though little risk of infection was posed to the general public, nurses were particularly vulnerable because of the proximal closeness of patient\u2013nurse interactions, direct contact with respiratory fluids of infected patients, and inadequacy of protective gear (Hall et al., 2003; Maunder et al., 2003). Greater stress levels due to increased interactions with patients have also been associated with increased emotional exhaustion and depersonalization in nurses, which are key symptoms of burnout (B\u00fcssing and Glaser, 1999).",

Robertson et al. (2004) found that nurses frequently reported their concerns about infection control but nevertheless, expressed their willingness to implement these procedures and continue working. In this regard, many nurses and healthcare providers reported that quarantining, one of the most common procedures used to control SARS, was necessary in order to protect others from infection (Robertson et al., 2004). On the other hand, when subjected to quarantine themselves, and especially when given little informational support by their respective healthcare institutions, workers reported feeling greater levels of stress, fear, frustration, stigmatization, and avoidance of others (Bai et al., 2004; Robertson et al., 2004).",

The authors posted an online questionnaire that attracted an international sample that included healthcare workers, engineers, office workers, and students. Multivariate analysis indicated that greater empathetic responding predicted significantly less avoidance behavior and significantly more preventive behavior; whereas, wishful thinking predicted only greater levels of avoidance behavior, which is less effective for coping with a perceived threat. Support seeking was not related to coping behavior (Lee-Baggley et al., 2004).",

In their sample of Peking University undergraduate students, their findings revealed that students who regarded daily stressful events as controllable applied problem-focused coping strategies (i.e., a good coping strategy-situation fit); whereas students who perceived SARS-related events as uncontrollable applied emotion-focused and problem-focused coping strategies interchangeably. Gan et al.

            "text": "Given that the research base on SARS is still relatively sparse, the extensive literature on stress, coping, and burnout is useful in understanding the impact that SARS had on nurses. Because nurses make up approximately 17% of the participants used in studies of burnout and occupational stress (see Schaufeli and Enzmann, 1998), we can generalize to some extent that the findings from this considerable body of research applies to nurses\u2019 reactions to SARS. In particular, research on nurses\u2019 reactions to hospital restructuring and downsizing has value because similar to the SARS crisis, these precarious times are novel, engender fear and uncertainty about the future, and are widely recognized as highly stressful for nurses (Begley, 1998). In longitudinal studies, researchers have consistently found an important role for organizational support in assuaging the effects of stressful events. Nurses\u2019 low perceptions of organizational support have been associated with low job satisfaction (Armstrong-Stassen, 2004; Siu, 2002), high psychological distress, high perceived-stress (Fisher, 1985), high absenteeism, high turnover (Begley, 1998), and increased burnout (Eisenberger et al., 1986; Firth and Britton, 1989; Siu, 2002). In cross-sectional studies, researchers have found evidence that low organizational support, in the form of high workload and increased time pressure, predicts increased emotional exhaustion, cynicism, hostility, anxiety, depression, somatization, work\u2013family conflict, and feelings of powerlessness (Burke and Greenglass, 2001; Escot et al., 2001; Greenglass and Burke, 2000; Greenglass et al., 2001). Astoundingly, 97% of the sample in Escot et al. (2001) reported needing more psychological support from their employers. Thus, generalizing from these findings, it is reasonable to suggest that nurses\u2019 stress reactions to SARS and their perceived organizational support are strongly related.",

Internet-mediated questionnaires represent a new and rapidly growing data collection tool in the social sciences. It affords researchers the ability to study unique phenomena that are otherwise difficult or impossible to study, and can tap into the experiences of larger specialized groups of people at lower cost to the researcher than other methods (Buchanan and Smith, 1999; Hewson, 2003; Kraut et al., 2004). Thus far, research on its psychometric properties has shown that online questionnaires are commensurate to paper-and-pencil formats in terms of reliability and internal validity (Buchanan and Smith, 1999; Hewson, 2003; Kraut et al., 2004). The main disadvantage of Internet-mediated research is that the samples it generates are self-selected; and therefore, potentially biased (Kraut et al., 2004). In general, it is difficult to ascertain whether Internet samples are representative of the group a researcher wishes to study. This puts into question the generalizability of a study's findings. Furthermore, because of the lack of physical interactivity between respondents and researchers, researchers cannot easily verify an individual's status or the veracity of their responses (Buchanan and Smith, 1999).",

In order to generate a representative sample, our partners in this project, the Registered Nurses\u2019 Association of Ontario (RNAO) encouraged all of its members to participate in the study via a posting on its website between March and May 2004. In this posting, the RNAO conveyed to its members the importance of generating knowledge about nurses\u2019 reactions to SARS and asked nurses to complete an online questionnaire about their SARS working experiences. Upon trying to access the questionnaire, nurses were prompted to authenticate their membership with their RNAO username and password. By posting the SARS questionnaire in a restricted area of the website, it is reasonable to assume that all of the respondents who completed the questionnaire were members of the RNAO, i.e., Ontarian nurses. After authenticating, nurses were led to an informed consent web page that asked nurses to read a description of the study, detailing the risks and benefits of participating, as well as thoroughly addressing issues of confidentiality and their anonymity in the sample. Once a nurse reached the bottom of this page, they were given the option of continuing on to the SARS questionnaire by clicking on an icon at the bottom of the page that read, \u201cI consent to participate.\u201d Otherwise, nurses could decline to participate and leave the website. The questionnaire itself took approximately 30 min to complete and consisted of items that tapped psychosocial issues, the quality of their working conditions, and demographics. The last item on the questionnaire asked nurses to generate a random and unique six-digit numerical code. The purpose of this was to enable us to match nurses\u2019 responses to this questionnaire with their responses to any follow-up questionnaires.",

Correlational analysis revealed several significant relationships, all of which were in the expected direction, largely corroborating patterns of findings in the burnout literature (e.g., anger correlated positively with emotional exhaustion, and negatively with vigor and organizational support; Begley, 1998; Eisenberger et al., 1986; Greenglass et al., 2001). The main finding of this study was that the model we evolved, including vigor, emotional exhaustion, trust, contact, and quarantine as predictors, explained significant amounts of variance in nurses\u2019 experiences of avoidance behavior, emotional exhaustion, and state anger. This demonstrates that regarding nurses\u2019 experiences of stress in the workplace, predictive value is increased by employing models which incorporate both psychosocial variables and working conditions.",

Of the psychosocial variables, vigor was the most influential, predicting to all three criterions. Organizational support was negatively related to avoidance behavior and state anger, while trust in equipment/infection control initiatives was negatively related to emotional exhaustion and state anger. Of the working conditions variables, greater spent time in quarantine was predictive of higher levels of avoidance behavior, and state anger, whereas greater contact with SARS patients was only predictive of greater emotional exhaustion. Importantly, these findings revealed that contact with SARS patients was not significantly predictive of avoidance behavior, as we hypothesized. Despite being marginally correlated, as shown in Table 1, multiple regression analysis showed that the relationship between contact and avoidance behavior was mediated through other important psychosocial and working conditions variables, such as vigor, organizational support, and time spent in quarantine. This is a positive finding because it suggests that the negative effects of contact can likely be lowered by improving perceived organizational support, promoting vigor as a proactive measure against stress, and paying special attention to nurses who are quarantined or isolated in times of crisis.",

It does, however, make intuitive sense when we consider that organizational support was measured with items about the availability of SARS information, whereas emotional exhaustion assessed feelings of being drained, used-up, and burnt out because of work. Thus, although organizational support, in the form of informational support has value, as indicated by its significant relationships to avoidance behavior and state anger, it does very little to alleviate emotional exhaustion which may be due to an overbearing workload and increased pressure at work. In future investigations, researchers should be cognizant of the kind of social support that is being provided, and the type of outcome that is being assessed. In our case, we were concerned with tapping informational support as a means to lessening the SARS threat; consequently, it was logical to limit our variable to cover this facet of organizational support.",

Research to date has shown that Internet-mediated questionnaires have reliability and internal validity characteristics that are proportionate to traditional paper-and-pencil questionnaire formats (Buchanan and Smith, 1999; Kraut et al., 2004). However, the main barriers to its wider acceptance as a data collection tool are the issues of sampling bias, affecting external validity, and the lack of interactivity between respondent and researcher, affecting the researcher's ability to authenticate an individual's responses (Kraut et al., 2004). In this study, we addressed these issues in the following ways. First, the questionnaire was posted on the nurses\u2019 website that encouraged their participation in the study and highlighted the importance of generating new knowledge about nurses\u2019 reactions to the SARS outbreak. Second, access to the questionnaire was restricted to Ontario nurses who belonged to a particular professional organization by requiring respondents provide a valid username and password before proceeding to the questionnaire itself. This ensured that only these nurses had access to the questionnaire, and moreover, that nurses could not contribute more than one questionnaire to the sample. Lastly, the confidentiality of nurses\u2019 responses was guaranteed on the pre-questionnaire informed consent web page. This was done to motivate nurses to respond more candidly to the questionnaire, which in turn would have increased the validity of our findings.",

The preparedness and efficacy of healthcare organizations to manage these crises over indefinite periods of time may mean the difference between minimal destructiveness of a disease running its course and catastrophic losses of life. Thus, by teaching nurses new working strategies that could help them prevent burnout, by making organizational supports congruent with nurses\u2019 specific needs, and by helping nurses reduce feelings of uncertainty and fear when these crises occur, healthcare organizations can increase the likelihood of optimal crisis management, and have the additional benefit of improving the lives of their employees, and the level of care they provide on a day-to-day basis.",
