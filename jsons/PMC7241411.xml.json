However, it is sometimes used to designate non-pneumonic infections of the lower respiratory tract alone. In patients with chronic lung disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), an infection of the bronchi often results in an exacerbation of the underlying lung illness. In these circumstances, the illness is usually designated as an exacerbation of disease (e.g., exacerbation of COPD) rather than \u201cacute bronchitis.\u201d",

These are mainly clinical classifications that broadly describe differences in the likely range of pathogens involved (Table 1\n). The commonest grouping is according to patient location at the time of acquisition of infection. Infections arising within a hospital setting may involve more drug-resistant pathogens compared to infections arising in the community. Within the grouping of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), further distinction is usually made according to whether the patient was on an intensive care unit, or intubated (ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP)) at the time of infection (Torres et al., 2017; Kalil et al., 2016). A specific category of Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) was previously advocated as describing pneumonia developing outside a hospital setting that shared features of pathogenesis, causative pathogens and antibiotic resistance patterns with nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pneumonia. This category was never fully adopted internationally and the latest evidence does not support the continued use of this classification.",

In the UK, a 34% increase in the incidence of CAP requiring hospitalization was observed from 1998 to 2005 (Trotter et al., 2008). Such trends of increasing incidence are thought to be explained by an aging population and a higher proportion of persons living with co-morbid illnesses, the latter encompassing an increase in persons with complex multi-morbidity. Some have implicated alterations in the epidemiology of causative pathogens (Quan et al., 2016). Changing patient expectations may also influence how healthcare is accessed and hospital admission policies. In contrast, in the US between 2001 and 2014, a decrease in the annual age-adjusted rate of pneumonia-associated hospitalisations was noted despite an increase in the proportion of co-existing immunocompromising conditions from 18.7% in 2001 to 29.9% in 2014 (Hayes et al., 2018).",

In addition, and perhaps more importantly, is the development of newer conjugated vaccines and high-dose vaccines that promote stronger immune responses in older at-risk persons compared to previous \u201cstandard\u201d influenza vaccines, hence offering greater protection. Influenza vaccines that are not strain-specific (so-called \u201cuniversal\u201d vaccines) and therefore less subject to mismatch are also being developed as are vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus.",

The future expectation is a shift towards targeted treatments supported by rapid diagnostics, thus enabling the use of non-antibiotic pathogen-specific therapies (such as anti-toxins) and promising the eradiation of inappropriate antimicrobial use. Immune-modulating agents may offer further benefits in relation to short-term recovery, and improved post-pneumonia care could translate into better longer-term outcomes.",
