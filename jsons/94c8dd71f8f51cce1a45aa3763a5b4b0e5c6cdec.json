We aimed to describe clinical and serological characteristics of children with HBoV hospitalized for acute respiratory tract infection and to evaluate whether differences occur between HBoV alone and in co-infection. Methods We retrospectively reviewed data from 60 children (median age of 6.2 months, range 0.6-70.9) hospitalized for acute respiratory symptoms, with HBoV detected from a respiratory sample, using a reverse transcriptase-PCR for 14 respiratory viruses (including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus A and B, human coronavirus OC43, 229E, NL-63 and HUK1, adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus1-3, and human metapneumovirus). Results HBoV was detected alone in 29 (48.3%) patients, while in co-infection with other viruses in 31 patients (51.7%), with a peak between December and January. Among the 60 patients, 34 were bronchiolitis, 19 wheezing, 3 pneumonia, 2 upper respiratory tract infection, and 2 whooping cough. Seven children (11.6%) required admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for respiratory failure. No differences was observed in age, family history for atopy and/or asthma, clinical presentations, chest X-ray, or laboratory findings in children with HBoV alone vs. multiple viral detection. RSV was the most frequently co-detected virus (61.3%). When compared with HBoV detection alone, the co-detection of RSV and HBoV was associated with male sex (P = 0.013), younger age (P = 0.01), and lower blood neutrophil count (P = 0.032). Conclusions HBoV can be detected alone and in co-infection respiratory samples of children with an acute respiratory tract infection. A cause-effect relationship between HBoV and respiratory infection is not clear, so further studies are needed to clarify this point.",

Ghietto [3] . The high rate of co-detection raises doubts on causal relationship of HBoV with respiratory infection, considering its prolonged persistence in the airways likewise. Several authors found the virus in different type of cells [20] and in respiratory samples of healthy volunteers [21] . In addition, we found 3% of HBoV detection among 21 controls without respiratory symptoms in our previous study [16] . The cause-effect relationship seems hard to be approved, but a possible help can rely on HBoV detection from the airways samples during the acute infection together with seroconversion of the anti-HBoV antibody titers [22] .",

In a previous study from our group [9] , we found that in infants with bronchiolitis, the RSV-HBoV co-detection was associated with higher severity and longer hospital stay than infants with bronchiolitis caused by RSV or RV or HBoV alone. Our study found that the co-detection of HBoV with RSV was associated with younger age, male sex, and lower neutrophils peripheral count, compared to HBoV detection alone. Considering only infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis, we confirmed our previous findings that the RSV-HBoV co-detection was associated with higher severity of the disease. Other studies confirmed the higher clinical severity presentation of RSV-HBoV co-infection in infants with respiratory infection [18] . A HBoV co-detection was registered in 42.1% patients with an acute episode of wheezing. Viral trigger in preschool wheeze is nowadays universally recognized, both for episodic and multiple trigger of wheezing [23] . Association of HBoV in respiratory samples and wheezing has been largely described in children [4] [5] [6] 17] . Calvo et al. found [19] infections caused by HBoV were clinically similar to those by RV, except for a higher necessity of oxygen support in the cases of HBoV. In our series, two out of the 19 infants (10.5%) hospitalized for wheezing had a severe clinical presentation and required admission to the PICU. HBoV was detected alone in severe cases and in all cases of pneumonia, suggesting that HBoV might play the role of a pathogen in patient with severe lower respiratory tract infection.",
