The guidelines are about the management of infection. This means that for conditions such as AECOPD, aspects of management that are unreleated to infection (e.g. use of steroids or bronchodilators) are not included. It contains the graded recommendations but also the background information for each recommendation, with details about each new cited reference and the evidence grades. Because this is an update, original data and publications have usually not been repeated and the reader is referred to the original publication [1] for this.

[21] report two or more pathogens at all ages, and as well in inpatients and outpatients, the most frequent combinations being those of bacteria with an atypical organism (29%) and two bacteria (29%); patients with mixed pneumonia are likely to have more co-morbidities and a more altered outcome. Angeles Marcos et al. [23] found that the most frequent co-pathogens were S. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae, and the most frequent combinations S. pneumoniae and either influenza or parainfluenza virus, and influenza virus with C. pneumoniae. De Roux et al. [29] reported that in the 10% of patients with mixed CAP, S. pneumoniae was the most prevalent microorganism; the most frequent combination was S. pneumoniae with H. influenzae; influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae was the most frequent association in the mixed pyogenic pneumonia group. Among the 17% of patients with mixed infections, Song et al. found 73% of patients with two different pathogens, 13% with three different pathogens and 13% with four different pathogens. The most frequent combination was S. pneumoniae with C. pneumoniae (15%). Mixed infections were found in 25% of patients with pneumococcal CAP [28]. Jennings et al. [27] found that polymicrobial infections involving bacterial and viral pathogens occurred in 15% of patients with CAP and might be associated with severe pneumonia. Johansson et al. found two or more pathogens in 35% of patients with CAP with a determined aetiology, most commonly S. pneumoniae together with a respiratory virus [18]. Evidence of concurrent bacterial infection was found in lung tissue specimens from 22 (29%) of the 77 US patients with fatal cases of confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), including 13% caused by S. pneumoniae [30].",

An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was reported in 2002, mainly in Asian countries and Canada [71, 72].

The loss of affinity for the PBPs affects all \u03b2-lactams, although this may vary substantially depending on the drug. The affinity for a given \u03b2-lactam is different for different PBPs, and conversely, one PBP has distinct affinities for different \u03b2-lactams. Therefore point mutations reducing the affinity for one \u03b2-lactam do not necessarily affect the affinity for another compound [178]. However, National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines state that a pneumococcal isolate that is susceptible to penicillin can be considered susceptible to other \u03b2-lactams. It is generally accepted that the MICs of amoxicillin and extended-spectrum cephalosporins are usually equal to or two to four times lower than the MIC of benzylpenicillin. However, pneumococci resistant to amoxicillin and or extended-spectrum cephalosporins with the MICs of these agents equal to or 1 dilution higher than the MIC of penicillin have been identified [179].",

The prevalence of resistance in many countries compromises the efficacy of macrolides in the treatment of pneumococcal infection. The prevalence of resistance will dictate the need to reassess current recommendations for the treatment of CAP.2Adequate choice and dosing of selected \u03b2-lactams is still useful in the treatment of extrameningeal pneumococcal infections. There are no documented failures in patients with extrameningeal infections due to penicillin-resistant strains treated with adequate doses of penicillins and third-generation cephalosporins. Penicillin, 2 g (3.2 mU) i.v. Q 4 h, should be adequate for strains with a penicillin MIC of \u22648 mg/L; adjust dose for renal impairment; ceftriaxone 1 g i.v. or i.m. Q 12 h or cefotaxime 2 g i.v. Q 6 h, should be adequate for strains with a MIC of \u22648 mg/L. A new formulation of Amox/Clav (2 g/125 Q 12 h) eradicated amoxicillin-resistant strains (MICs, 4\u20138 mg/L) in two RCTs. Oral cephalosporins are not adequate for the treatment of infection caused by strains with penicillin MICs >2 mg/L.3Fluoroquinolones are highly active and efficacious against respiratory pathogens; they should be used in welldefined circumstances. If the prevalence of first-step mutants is low, the use of the most potent FQ is a logical choice if resistance has to be avoided/delayed. Previous exposure to an FQ in the recent past precludes the use of a member of this class for the empirical treatment of CAP.4Macrolides show, at best, only modest activity against H. influenzae. The existence of efflux pumps leads to loss of susceptibility to this class in more than 98% of H. influenzae strains.5Among \u2018atypicals', antibiotic resistance is rare and very seldom responsible for clinical failures.6Macrolide resistance in Mycoplasma pneumoniae is rising in Japan; there is a need for European local surveillance studies.7The role of CA-MRSA in CAP is poorly defined, although emergent in Europe. CA-MRSA is usually only resistant to the \u03b2-lactams and susceptible to most other antibiotic classes. The antibiotic treatment of CA-MRSA pneumonia is not known. As suppression of toxin production may correlate with improved outcome, vancomycin alone may not be the optimal treatment for pneumonia. Thus, the combination of a bactericidal agent with a toxin-suppressing agent, such a clindamycin or linezolid, has been suggested as the optimal choice.8\nIn vivo selection of resistance means that proper use of antimicrobials is essential.\n",

Moreover, the CURB-65 has been shown to outperform generic sepsis and early warning scores [255]. In view of its simplicity and the absence of any laboratory and radiographic criterion, which may not be easily available in general practice, the CRB-65 score is recommended as tool of choice in the assessment of pneumonia severity. Systolic blood pressure is the best haemodynamic predictor; diastolic pressure may be neglected [256]. The priority of clinical judgement and the need to consider non-clinical factors for decision making about treatment settings is reinforced [257, 258, 259]. In patients residing in nursing homes, a predefined clinical pathway can help to reduce hospitalization by about 50%, with comparable clinical outcomes [260].",

It appears that all of them seem to have a significant potential to predict mortality. Some data suggest that predictive tools and biomarkers do not reflect identical processes and that biomarkers may improve predictions based on clinical parameters [276, 277]. However, the optimal use of clinical assessment, including severity scores and biomarkers, remains to be established. Currently, CRP and PCT are best available and may be implemented as an additional severity tool; however, the evidence is still limited. Among all biomarkers investigated, pro-ADM seems most promising [271, 272].",

Second, the decision to admit to the ICU is usually not exclusively based on clinical criteria but also depends on the local settings and facilities [279, 281, 282, 283].

New Legionella antigen tests have been developed and are becoming available. They show performances comparable to that of the Binax NOW test and could be an alternative for the detection of L. pneumophila antigen in urine from patients suspected of having a Legionella pneumonia [322, 323].",

Although IgM detection in the acute phase shows a moderate sensitivity, provided a specific test is used, a combination of IgM antibody detection and PCR may be the most sensitive approach to diagnose Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections, as demonstrated in the study by Martinez [334] and in the CAPNETZ study [335].

Non-response after 72 h is usually due to a complication. The evaluation of non-responding pneumonia depends on the clinical condition. There are no trials of different approaches to the non-responding patient to guide this recommendation. In unstable patients, full reinvestigation followed by a second empirical antimicrobial treatment regimen should be carried out. The latter may be withheld in stable patients. Slowly resolving pneumonia should be reinvestigated according to clinical needs, the condition of the patient and his/her individual risk factors [C3].",

Over the course of the lifetime of a COPD patient, the flora associated with exacerbations does change. In severe cases with FEV1 < 50% of normal, Gram-negative flora, including P. aeruginosa, become increasingly important as associated pathogens [458].

[167] showed that the frequency of isolation from sputum of bacteria and viruses was much higher during exacerbations than during stable periods, and that eosinophilia within sputum was higher in viral infections. Furthermore, in a longitudinal study of bacterial load in sputum amongst patients with COPD, the FEV1 decline was mirrored by an increase in sputum bacterial load [470]. A recent detailed longitudinal study found that quantitative counts of established sputum flora do not greatly change between stable and exacerbation periods in COPD patients [471]. Sethi et al. [472] have demonstrated that during exacerbations of COPD caused by H. influenzae there is a specific immune response to the infecting strain of H. influenzae.",

Although smoking seems to be a significant risk factor in otherwise healthy younger adults, measures aimed at reducing smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke should be preferred in this group.3Revaccination, once, and not earlier than 5 years after primary vaccination, should be performed in asplenic patients and can be considered in the elderly and other high-risk groups [B3].4There are not enough data to give any recommendations concerning the use of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in adults.\n",

It is also important to stress that the PPV includes 23 antigens and that a person can develop a pneumococcal disease from one of these serotypes, despite responding to all the others [530]. Previously, there have been conflicting data concerning whether a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) could result in a superior immune response in elderly patients or high-risk adults, compared with PPV [531], but a couple of recent studies do indicate that this may be the case [532, 533]. The drawbacks of PCV, however, are the limited number of serotypes, the much higher price, and the lack of data on efficacy (although a large RCT is underway).",

However, a recent double-blind randomized controlled trial among about 1000 nursing home residents in Japan demonstrated that PPV was associated with a reduction of the incidence of all-cause pneumonia by 45% and of pneumococcal pneumonia by 64% [546]. There was also a significant higher death rate among persons with pneumococcal pneumonia in the placebo group, 35% (13/37) vs. 0% (0/14). This study supportsearlier findings from recent cohort studies indicating that PPV is associated with a reduction of pneumonia overall, pneumococcal pneumonia, hospitalization for pneumonia and death due to pneumonia [544, 545, 547, 553, 554]. In contrast, some other cohort studies have found no protection against all-cause pneumonia or hospitalization for pneumonia [543, 550].",

In a large randomized controlled trial patients who previously had received one dose of PPV were randomized to receive PPV or PCV, in four different dosages [558]. Local side-effects were common, but usually mild. The frequency of local reactions in the PCV group depended on the dose given, and in the highest dosage group the risk of a reaction was comparable to that of PPV. In a prospective cohort study of 61 elderly persons (median age 75 years) revaccinated on average 5.3 years after the primary vaccination, significant increases of the geometric mean antibodyconcentration and geometric mean antibody fold increase were seen, although to lower levels than after primary vaccination [559]. Thirty-six of 61 (59%) of patients responded with a fold increase >2, to two or more of six serotypes. Early revaccination may lead to a short-lived antibody rise, which could be due to an immunological suppression or tolerance [532]. However, this suppressive effect seems to wane after some years and in studies where revaccination has been performed after 5 years or more persons have responded well [559, 560].",
