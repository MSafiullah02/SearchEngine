The signal of the scattered light is transformed into an electrical signal that is proportional to the concentration of the dispersed particles and therefore also to the antigen concentration. Measurements are done using the \u201cfixed\u2010time\u2010method,\u201d whereby a difference is calculated between 2 values measured at different times. Nephelometric analysis is always performed in the presence of antibody excess according to the principles of Heidelberger and Kendall,\n15\n thus ensuring precise results, creating minimal need for repeated measurements, and covering a wide range of measurement with the antibody excess curve.\n12\n At present, there is no standardization of measurement of CSF total protein (CSF\u2010TP) in animals, and a variety of methods and standards are utilized in veterinary laboratories. Historically, high\u2010resolution protein electrophoresis has been used for CSF albumin and IgG determination.

However, FIP was confirmed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical examination in the brain and viscera. Four cats with mild lymphocytic meningitis and neuropathologic alterations were interpreted as having possible FIP or viral meningitis of unknown viral origin. One cat had an unusual pattern of distribution of cerebral lesions, with unilateral involvement of the thalamus. However, all 4 cats had extraneural granulomatous lesions typical of FIP. The possibility that CSF examination and histopathology were done too early in the course of the disease with inadequate activation of immune defense systems was excluded. This was based on the knowledge that although clinical signs of FIP may appear acutely in some cats, the pathogenesis of FIP lesions is usually more chronic. Furthermore, IgG might have precipitated in the lesions in the form of immune complexes. This phenomenon also accounts for the fact that about 10% of cats with clinical signs of FIP are antibody\u2010negative in the blood.\n52\n\n",

In FIP, both intrathecal synthesis of specific antibodies and passive diffusion of antibodies across the BBB have been demonstrated.\n19\n, \n47\n Thus, meaningful interpretation of CSF antibody titers requires evaluation of the integrity of the BBB as well as calculation of the amount of intrathecally produced antibody.
