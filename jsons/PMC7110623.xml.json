Pneumonia is the leading cause of hospitalization and intensive care unit admissions during the Hajj [2]. Streptococcus pneumoniae was isolated in 37% of patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia during the Hajj in Saudi hospitals [3]. Attack rates of respiratory symptoms among French Hajj pilgrims have been shown to be as high as 90% [4]. Nasal carriage of S. pneumoniae among French Hajj pilgrims, as reported in 2012, was 20% before leaving the KSA as opposed to 7% before departing from France [5]. In 2013, 62% of the French Hajj pilgrims tested positive for S. pneumoniae in throat samples following participation to the Hajj and 36.3% of them had acquired the infection during their stay in KSA [4]. Evidence for the importance of pneumococcal disease at the Hajj is summarized in Table 1\n.",
