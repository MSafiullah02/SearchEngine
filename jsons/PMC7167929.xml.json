Despite their ubiquitous nature, rhinoviruses are not well described. More than 200 viruses cause the common cold, including, in addition to the rhinovirus, coronaviruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses, and adenoviruses. In about 25% of colds, the causative agent is unknown. Further, not everyone exposed to rhinovirus becomes symptomatic; 25% of infected persons do not develop symptoms (van Benten et al., 2003).",

In general, virus is deposited into the front of the nasal passages by contaminated fingers or by droplets from coughs and sneezes (Hendley & Gwaltney, 1988). The virus is then transported by mucociliary action to the back of the nose and onto the adenoid area where it attaches to a receptor that is located on the surface of nasal epithelial cells. The receptor fits into a docking port on the surface of the virus (Winther et al., 1997). After attachment, virus particles are produced and the infected cell ruptures, releasing newly made cold virus to infect other cells in the nose and start the process over again. The incubation period is 8\u201312 hr, and the time to peak symptoms is 36\u201372 hr. Small doses of virus (1\u201330 particles) are sufficient to produce infection (Douglas, 1970). Cold symptoms result from host inflammatory mediators that cause vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, manifested as rhinorrhea, congestion, sneezing, and coughing.",

Since 1977, influenza A (H1N1), influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B viruses have been in global circulation. In 2001, influenza A (H1N2) viruses that probably emerged after genetic reassortment between human A (H3N2) and A (H1N1) viruses began circulating widely (CDC, 2005b). More recently, there is growing concern about the potential for a pandemic with avian influenza A (H5N1) because of animal\u2010to\u2010human and subsequent human\u2010to\u2010human transmission (Beigel et al., 2005).",

One of the predominant features of influenza viruses is their ability to mutate rapidly (\u201cantigenic drift\u201d) or undergo genomic reassortment (\u201cantigenic shift\u201d), resulting in the need for frequent modifications of vaccines to keep pace with the rapidly changing antigenic characteristics of the virus. These two features of the influenza virus\u2014the fast and unpredictable antigenic changes of immune targets and the ability to reassort and circulate among non\u2010human reservoirs (birds and pigs, for example)\u2014are responsible for much of the global spread and persistence of the infection (Lavenu et al., 2006).",

Generally, there is a single receptor\u2010binding site, although certain avian influenza viruses like H5N1 are able to bind to different target cells, making possible the direct transfer of avian flu between birds and humans. The virus\u2010receptor complex is then endocytosed and replication occurs rapidly, with viral shedding occurring within 6 hr of infection. Infectious particles are released from the plasma membrane of epithelial cells by budding, which facilitates the rapid spread to other cells within the lung. Unlike viruses causing the common cold, however, influenza virus replicates in cells of the lower as well as the upper respiratory tract (Kamps, Hoffmann, & Preiser, 2006).",

Colds account for approximately 25 million primary care visits, 1.6 million visits to the emergency department, and 42 million missed work or school days annually in the United States (Gonzales et al., 2006; Heikkinen & Jarvinen, 2003). In fact, one U.S. study of >1,000 children attending day care reported that at any given time, 23% had a URI (Carabin, Gyorkos, Soto, Penrod et al., 1999). URI reduce alertness and slow reaction times at work, even during the incubation period and after clinical symptoms have resolved. In a survey of >3,000 healthy university students, 91% reported having at least one URI and 36.7% reported at least one influenza\u2010like illness in the previous year. These illnesses resulted in 6,023 days in bed, 7,438 missed school or work days, and >45,000 days of illness. In addition, 22.2% made a health care visit, 15.8% took an antibiotic, and 74.1% reported doing poorly on a test or assignment as a result of their illness (Nichol, D'Heilly, & Ehlinger, 2005). In a prospective cohort study of 208 families with at least one child <5 years old, 0.45 viral URI/person\u2010month were reported, with a secondary transmission rate within the household of 0.63 illnesses/person\u2010month (Lee, Friedman, Ross\u2010Degnan, Hibberd, & Goldmann, 2003). Among 383 children aged 2 months\u201312 years followed by 7 pediatricians in Toronto, 72% had symptoms of a URI during a 6\u2010month time period and medical attention was sought by 56% (Saunders, Tennis, Jacobson, Gans, & Dick, 2003).",

In a U.K. survey of 411 workers, the average missed work per episode of flu\u2010like illness was 2.8 days (Keech, Scott, & Ryan, 1998). French researchers in a prospective study reported that 38.3% of household contacts of an influenza\u2010positive index case became secondary cases, 57% of whom sought medical care at least once. The mean duration of illness was 8 days in index cases and 7 days in secondary cases seeking medical care (Carrat et al., 2002). Epidemics of influenza typically occur during the winter months and are associated with >500,000 hospitalizations and about 36,000 deaths/year (Thompson et al., 2004). Among healthy children aged 6\u201323 months in the Boston area, the rate of outpatient visits during influenza periods was 8 times higher than in non\u2010influenza periods, and the rate of hospitalization for acute respiratory disease was 2.7 times (O'Brien et al., 2004).",

While this problem has improved over the past decade, reported rates of antibiotic prescribing for viral URI still range from 30% to 78% (Mangione\u2010Smith, Wong, Elliott, McDonald, & Roski, 2005; Rutschmann & Domino, 2004). Unfortunately, the rates of inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics are similar for nurse practitioners and physicians (Ladd, 2005). Further, the prescription rate is an underestimate of this problem because high rates of unprescribed antibiotic use for viral URI and the availability of antibiotics without prescription have been reported in the community (Larson & Grullon\u2010Figueroa, 2004; Larson, Dilone, Garcia, & Smolowitz, 2006).",

Vaccination significantly reduces influenza\u2010related costs in healthy children as well as their unvaccinated family members.

Further, studies that have been conducted are generally of poor quality, almost all have been funded by manufacturers of products, and the results are inconsistent for most interventions that have been tested. Most herbal remedies commonly used by the public (echinacea, vitamins C and E, zinc products) have been shown to have little, if any, preventive effect for URI. There have been, however, several recent clinical trials of ginseng in which there was a protective effect demonstrated when compared with placebo. This potential therapy warrants further study.",
