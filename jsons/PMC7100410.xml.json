In the emergency department, the screening of common respiratory viruses was negative, blood routine examination reported a significant increasing of monocyte count, and chest computed tomography (CT) reported a ground glass shadow in the right upper lobe tip segment of the lung. After admission, 2019-nCoV-RNA was detected in throat swabs. After reporting to the local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this patient was asked to transfer to a specialized hospital designated by the government. When he transferred to the designated hospital on January 25, the local CDC recollected the throat swab samples and re-detected 2019-nCoV-RNA. Surprisingly, 2019-nCoV-RNA was not detected in two consecutive throat swabs with an interval of 1 day. Thus, this patient was released from isolation.",

Considering the previous detection of 2019-nCoV-RNA in throat swabs, we recollected throat swab as well as deep sputum samples. Undoubtedly, 2019-nCoV-RNA was detected in sputum at this time. On January 28, a slight aggravation of pneumonia was reported; antiviral drug lopinavir/ritonavir (two tablets twice a day) was prescribed. After 3 days\u2019 therapy, the situation of pneumonia became worse; thus, methylprednisolone (40 mg intravenous drip for 3 consecutive days) and aerosol interferon therapies (5 million units per time for 3 consecutive days) were added. As expected, pneumonia improved significantly. On February 8, 2019-nCoV-RNA were all negative in throat swabs, sputum, blood, and feces (Fig. 1b). On February 9, he had a normal temperature without respiratory symptoms for at least 10 days, and 2019-nCoV-RNA was still negative in feces. Thus, he was discharged and asked to observe at home for 2 weeks. The detailed clinical information was shown in Fig. 1. During hospitalization, the results of noninvasive finger pulse oxygen saturation were in normal range, even when there is significant progress of pneumonia in chest CT.",

            "text": "The first question is how to provide a qualified specimen for viral existence evaluation. Collecting the right specimen at the right time is extremely important. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is the best specimen type, but it is not realistic for almost all hospitals. In recently published literature, saliva, nasopharynx swab, sputum, blood, and feces samples are mentioned, but only nasopharynx swabs and sputum are routinely used. The 2019-nCoV in nasopharynx swab or sputum is recommended as the judgment standard of virus infection and clearance. For this case, the initial diagnosis of 2019-nCoV infection and the followed denial of 2019-nCoV infection in other hospital are both based on the results of 2019-nCoV detection in pharyngeal swabs. What is the cause for the negative result in other hospital? In addition to the possible deficiencies in sample collection and processing, the impact of disease\u2019s own progress also cannot be ignored. The longer the course of disease, the more likely the virus will disappear in throat swab. Thus, the detection of nasopharynx swab in early stage of diseases may be of more value than in late stage of diseases, and it is inappropriate to use nasopharynx swab result to determine whether the virus is eliminated in the body. For patients with negative viral detection in nasopharyngeal swab, but with a clear epidemiological history or typical clinical manifestations, we cannot easily deny or exclude the possibility of 2019-nCoV infection.",

As long as conditions permit, we strongly recommend sputum for virus detection. If necessary, we can also use some special equipment or inducer to help us collect enough sputum for measurement. Of course, for patients who really cannot provide sputum samples, nasal swabs are better than pharyngeal swabs for viral nucleic acid detection.",

At discharge, 2019-nCoV was not detected in the feces of this patient. But we cannot rule out the possibility of virus detection in his feces after discharge in the future. So, the second question is how to evaluate the results of viral nucleic acid detection in feces. Recently, scientists have isolated 2019-nCoV strains from critically ill patients\u2019 feces. In our hospital, 2019-nCoV was not detected in blood of all admitted patients (unpublished data). Thus, 2019-nCoV in feces may come from sputum swallowed by mouth, rather than from blood. But we do not know whether the persistent positive feces detection means the long-term carrying of the virus. At present, if conditions permit, it is better to do a fecal 2019-nCoV detection before de-isolation. If the detection result is positive, we may consider extending the time for isolation in hospital. Currently, negative fecal detection is required for de-isolation in our hospital. However, we still need to remind that this proposal lacks sufficient evidence at present and its rationality needs to be further confirmed.",

So, the third question is how to early predict the rapidly worsening conditions. Besides respiratory symptoms, pulmonary CT and arterial blood gas analysis are two tools for evaluating the patients\u2019 condition, and dynamic chest CT is easier to achieve for most hospitals. In this patient, the judgment of disease progression mainly depends on the deterioration of pulmonary HRCT, even without a significant increase in respiratory rate and a decrease in blood oxygen saturation. In fact, pulmonary CT is strongly recommended for assessing the presence and severity of pneumonia [4]. Thus, at the early stage of pneumonia, pulmonary CT should be done every 3\u20135 days, and this could help to accurately predict the worsening of pneumonia.",

In this patient, low-dose and short-course glucocorticoids were prescribed, and a rapid pulmonary HRCT improvement was observed.
