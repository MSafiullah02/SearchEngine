            "text": "Precipitation of second phase particles such as Ti, Nb, and V carbonitrides can have a very positive effect on mechanical properties of microalloyed steels. Low temperature precipitation (in ferrite or in \u03b1/\u03b3 interphase) leads to a distribution of fine particles, that have a strong strengthening effect (Porter & Easterling 1992). Moreover carbides and carbonitrides stable at high temperature have a pinning effect on austenite grain boundaries (grain size control) leading to optimal mechanical properties (Gladman 2002). For both strengthening and grain size control, it is essential to quantify size distribution and precipitated volume fraction.",

Electrons of the primary beam that have experienced an inelastic scattering caused by a given atomic specie only present in the precipitates can be used to produce an elementary map imaging the particles of interest (Hofer et al. 1996; Craven et al. 2000; Rainforth et al. 2002; Beres et al. 2004; Courtois et al. 2006; Mackenzie et al. 2006) with a very good spatial resolution (i.e. near 1 nm Mackenzie et al. (2006)). HAADF in TEM is another imaging method allowing nanometric particles or precipitates to be easily imaged within thin foils and/or when collected on a supporting film (such as extraction replicas in the case of precipitates). In this method, the intensity is roughly proportional to Z2 (where Z is the atomic number), and excellent contrast is obtained in the case of nanometric particles deposited on holey carbon grids (Treacy & Rice 1989), or carbon or alumina extraction replicas, respectively (Wilson & Craven 2003; Courtois et al. 2006). From a practical point of view, extraction replicas represent a very attractive method, when applicable to precipitation problems (see Bradley (1965) and references therein for a general presentation of the replica techniques). After a slight pre\u2010etching, the surface of the material is covered by a nanometric film, and the matrix is further selectively dissolved, allowing precipitates to be retained and observed on the deposited film. In the case of steels, this preparation offers two great advantages: (i) to get rid of the undesirable magnetic influence of the iron matrix during TEM work; and (ii) to allow very large numbers of particles to be measured on a single replica.",

In the first step, they were further heated at 700\u00b0C for 10 h in vacuum (quartz encapsulation). In the second step, samples were then heated at 800\u00b0C for 10 days (to allow coarsening in austenite), and finally slowly cooled down to room temperature (Fig. 1). The pertinence of this two\u2010step procedure is detailed elsewhere (Epicier et al. 2008). This state (called fully precipitated state [FPS]), was chosen as the starting point for a series of isothermal heat treatments in austenite. In order to validate the STEM approach on replicas on different precipitation states, FPS samples were heat treated at different temperatures between 870 and 1200\u00b0C, and for different holding times from 2 min to 9 days. These reversion experiments were performed either in a molten salt bath or in a furnace under quartz encapsulation. Samples were water quenched to room temperature. The obtained states will be hereafter called as partially dissolved states (PDS) (Fig. 1).",

In this work, only \u2018dark\u2010field\u2019 imaging has been performed. The intensity of these images depends in a complex way on the chemical composition, because deflected electrons have experienced different interaction mechanisms (elastic or inelastic scattering). Hence, it is difficult to establish a direct link between the intensity of the particles and their chemical composition as permitted in HAADF on the basis of Eq. 1. According to Fig. 2, the collection conditions cannot be strictly controlled as in the case of an annular detector. Nevertheless, detection angles estimated in our case are ranging from 10 to a few dozens degrees in a limited angular sector.

In the HAADF image (Fig. 6(b)), the VC precipitate surprisingly vanishes. A careful examination of expressions 1 and 2 implies that this experimental result can only be explained if the matrix thickness t (which enters into the expression of the number of irradiated atoms ni of Eq. 1) is smaller than the precipitate size, and if the particles are not totally embedded into the matrix. Computations performed varying (i) the matrix thickness; (ii) the precipitates embedding depth within matrix lead to the reasonable configuration as shown in Fig. 6(c), where each precipitate is only partly buried on 30 nm within a 50\u2010nm iron matrix. Simulated images confirm that the vanadium carbide particle cannot be discerned under those HAADF conditions (the difference in intensity between the VC particle and the surrounding Fe matrix, hardly discernable on the simulation, is about 4%).

In SEM, the contrast of the biggest particles is here different: they appear dark in the centre. This inversion of contrast is partly due to the energy of the incident beam: in TEM, incident electrons have a sufficient energy (200 kV) to pass across the largest particles without any significant losses which would decrease the scattered intensity collected by the annular detector, whereas 30 kV electrons in the SEM experience efficient back\u2010scattering or other inelastic processes for larger particles which decrease the collectable STEM signal compared to thinner particles.
