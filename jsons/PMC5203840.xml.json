The conducting airways comprise the cartilaginous airways from the trachea to the 10th generation of the bronchial tree, and the non-cartilaginous airways of the small bronchi to the terminal bronchioles until the 16th generation. Generations 17 to 23 are considered as respiratory airways, which finally end in the alveoli (Fig. 1a). The conducting airways ensure the humidification of inhaled air, sensing of irritants, trapping of inhaled particulate noxae and their removal from the surface of airways by mucocilliary clearance. The airways are lined by a pseudo-stratified columnar ciliated epithelium. The epithelia of the cartilaginous airways are composed of glands, ciliated cells and mucus-producing goblet cells with the number of glands and goblet cells decreasing and the number of mucus-producing club cells increasing from proximal to distal. In the non-cartilaginous airways, neither glands nor goblet cells are present, but an increasing number of columnar epithelial cells and club cells are found. The respiratory airways form a transition between the conducting part and the alveoli. They guide the inhaled air towards the alveoli and contribute to the gas exchange. They are lined by a non-ciliated epithelium, which is distinct from the conducting airway as well as from the alveolar epithelium. However, with respect to its architecture, it is more related to the conducting airways than to the epithelium, which lines the alveolar space. Within the respiratory section, mucus-producing cells are sparse and are completely absent as closer the epithelium is localized to the alveolus. The alveolar epithelium compromises only two types of cells, alveolar type I and type II cells. Its architecture optimises it for gas exchange.\n",

            "text": "The epithelium of the conducting and respiratory airways as well as the epithelium of the alveoli constitutes a barrier that separates the air-filled compartment of the respiratory system from the aqueous interstitial compartment. This separation of both compartments from each other is a major task of the airway epithelium; yet, at the same time, the epithelium also has to manage a regulated exchange of solutes and water between these compartments. Two main transport pathways across the epithelium\u2014trans- and paracellularly\u2014are well established. The transcellular transport pathway depends on the polarised distribution of ion channels and transporters localised in the apical and basolateral membrane. Upon resorption, Na+ enters the cell via apically localised epithelial sodium channels and is released into the interstitium via basolaterally localised Na+/K+-ATPase. Paracellular transport runs through the extracellular compartment between the lateral membranes of neighbouring epithelial cells. It depends on diffusion processes, which are driven by chemical and electrochemical gradients across the epithelial cell layer. This paracellular transport is controlled by heteromeric protein complexes, which are formed at cell-cell interfaces at the apical side of the lateral membranes between adjacent cells. These complexes are called tight junctions (TJ) and seal the lateral space at its apical side. Despite the importance of sealing the epithelium, TJs must confer a certain permeability to ensure a sufficient exchange and transport across the epithelium. The permeability of TJs depends on the protein composition and can be adjusted to be permeable for solutes of different charges, sizes and water [45, 70]. TJs are composed of occludin and various claudins with the claudin composition being the main regulator of tight junction permeability (permselectivity) [71, 109]. Claudins are proteins with four membrane spanning domains (tetraspanins) and constitute a unique protein family consisting of 27 members [42]. A loss of TJ permselectivity in the airways results in an un-controlled leakage of high molecular weight proteins and water into the airways, which finally results in the formation of alveolar oedema and respiratory distress syndrome.",

They are lined by the alveolar epithelium (Fig. 1c), which is part of the diffusion barrier across which the gas exchange occurs. To this end, the main surface of the alveolar epithelium forms an extremely thin cell layer with a unique architecture [26, 138]. Two cell types constitute the alveolar epithelium, the squamous alveolar type I (AT-I) cells and the cuboidal alveolar type II (AT-II) cells. The lateral contact between adjacent AT-I cells is sealed by a narrow band formed by TJ complexes. In contrast, the lateral contact between adjacent AT-I and AT-II cells is formed and sealed by a much broader TJ complex [138]. The cell type specificity of TJ morphology is reflected by heterogeneity of claudin expression in alveolar epithelial cells. Both alveolar epithelial cell types express cldn3, cldn4 and the splice variant cldn18-1 most abundantly [36, 74, 132]. Their phylogeny places cldn3 and cldn4 into the class of classical claudins, whereas cldn18 is a member of the so-called non-classical claudin family [72]. However, the claudin expression pattern differs between AT-I and AT-II cells. Cldn18 transcripts account for 56%, cldn3 transcripts for 31% and cldn4 transcripts for 10% of all claudin transcripts in AT-I cells. AT-II cells exhibit a different quantitative sequence. In this cell type, 67% of all claudin transcripts are cldn3 transcripts, 23% are cldn4 transcripts and only 7% of the claudin transcripts encode for cldn18 [74]. These claudins are all elevated in bronchio-alveolar lavage 24 h after acute lung injury [61] underscoring their dominant expression especially within the alveolar epithelium.",

These mice demonstrated an increased susceptibility to hypoxia and ventilator induced lung injury and an increased solute permeability of the alveolar epithelium without altering its transepithelial electrical resistance [64]. During early stages of acute lung injury, cldn4 becomes up-regulated, possibly to limit lung oedema formation [144]. A role of cldn4 in compensatory alveolar fluid clearance is further supported by the observation that increased cldn4 protein levels are associated with increased alveolar water resorption [105]. Hence, cldn4 has sealing function in the alveolar epithelium that is necessary for volume homeostasis of the alveolar liquid layer.",

Cldn18-1 variants are predominantly expressed in the lung whereas cldn18-2 variant expression is found predominantly in the stomach [94]. Cldn18 knock-down mice showed a fairly mild phenotype. Cldn18 knockout disturbs TJ formation in the alveolar epithelium which is in line with an increase in paracellular permeability [75, 78]. Despite disturbed barrier function, alveolar liquid volume homeostasis was stable and susceptibility to ventilator-induced lung injury was even reduced in knockout animals. These mild effects are possibly due to increased water and ion transport capacities and a compensatory elevation of cldn4 expression levels [78]. Therefore, cldn18-1 plays a role in TJ organisation and may also have a sealing function in alveolar epithelia.",

The pathway of water flux across airway epithelia is a matter of debate. Studies by the Verkman group, employing genetic knock-down of aquaporins, revealed a minor contribution of the transcellular, and therefore TJ independent pathway, on transepithelial water transport in the lung [83, 84, 114, 130, 131], suggesting a major contribution of TJ-dependent paracellular water flux to overall transepithelial water flux. However, other studies found that perturbations of aquaporin activity disturb transepithelial water transport and volume homeostasis in the airways [2, 32, 35, 113, 127], suggesting that TJ-independent water transport pathways through aquaporins contribute significantly to fluid transport across the airway epithelium. A more recent study now suggests that both processes occur in a different manner, where basal water transport activity is dominated by a paracellular pathway, whereas a compensatively increased water resorption is predominantly carried by an aquaporin-dependent transcellular pathway [110]. In airway epithelial cells, cldn2 localises in intracellular stores rather than at the TJs [62] and is regulated by TNF-\u03b1 [86].

Inhibition of basal NF\u03baB activity in airway epithelial cells increases cldn5 expression in the absence of inflammation [134]. This is in line with the observation that TNF-\u03b1, which activates the classical NF\u03baB signalling pathway, down-regulates cldn5 promotor activity [11, 18]. Indeed, increased TNF-\u03b1 levels attenuate cldn5 expression in a mouse model of acute lung inflammation [86]. Overall, NF\u03baB-dependent reduction of cldn5 seems to improve epithelial barrier function during lung inflammation and seems to be beneficial with respect to epithelial function. Contrary to that, virus infection-induced lung injury is associated with decreased cldn5 expression levels [10, 54, 79]. In the lung, cldn5 expression is also observed in endothelial cells of blood vessels [63], and Cldn5 is demonstrated to protect endothelial barriers from LPS-induced leakage.",

However, studies addressing the permeability properties of cldn7 revealed a more complex function of cldn7 on TJ permeability. Overexpressing cldn7 in the porcine kidney, epithelial cell line LLC-PK1 resulted in an increased transepithelial electrical resistance via reducing paracellular Cl\u2212 permeability while forming a Na+ pore. While cldn7 confers ion or charge selective pores to the TJ and reduces the overall permeability for ions, it increases the permeability of TJ to uncharged molecules [6]. Silencing of cldn7 expression in LLC-PK1 reduces transepithelial resistance and increases paracellular permselectivity for Na+ over Cl\u2212 [51]. These results agree with the results from the above-cited cldn7 overexpression experiments [6]. However, when cldn7 was silenced in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK), the transepithelial resistance decreased and paracellular permselectivity for Cl\u2212 increased over that for Na+ [51]. This indicates that the effect of cldn7 on TJs depends on its cellular background. Phosphorylation of cldn7 within its C-terminal, intracellular domain via WNK4 kinase modulates cldn7 permeability. It instead promotes paracellular ion permeability and increases Cl\u2212 permselectivity of TJ [124]. Possibly, differences in post-transcriptional protein modification explain the variability in cldn7 function observed within different cell types.",

Only in the later case, the mucosal architecture of intestinal epithelium was massively disturbed due to cldn7 knockout [30]. In airway epithelia, cldn7 localises throughout the lateral membrane of epithelial cells [24]. Possibly, organisation of lateral adhesion junctions between epithelial cells is one of the major tasks of cldn7 in the airways. This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that cldn7 regulates cell attachment by interacting with integrin-\u03b21 in human lung cancer cells [82].",

Therefore, cldn8 increases permselectivity of TJ for Cl\u2212. Cldn8 interacts with cldn4, and cldn8 is required to localise cldn4 at the TJs in MDCK cells [52]. This led to the conclusion that both claudins are required for paracellular Cl\u2212 permselectivity. Cldn8 mediated sealing of TJ to Na+ parallels Na+ absorption in human colon cells [52], and hence, it is proposed that cldn8 augments sodium resorption by preventing paracellular leakage of Na+. Investigation of cldn8 function in the lung is rather sparse. Immnunohistochemical experiments revealed that cldn8 localises along conductive and respiratory airway epithelia, where it accumulates apico-laterally at the TJs [66]. In the alveolar epithelium, cldn8 staining revealed a faint and cytoplasmic staining in some alveolar type II cells [66]. In the airway epithelium, cldn8 is up-regulated by glucocorticoids but not by mineralocorticoids [66]. It is required for recruitment of occludin to the TJs, and thereby, it confers sealing properties and Cl\u2212 permselectivity to the TJ [66].",

            "text": "The airway epithelium constitutes the first cell layer that gets into contact with inhaled noxae and has to impede impending injuries. However, it also comprises an ideal structure to sense inhaled noxae (Fig. 2). Human bronchial epithelial cells were recently identified as a source of cytokines in the lung, and therefore, the airway epithelium was proposed as a sensor of airborne noxae [27]. Bacterial and viral infections induce TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-18 [21, 77, 101, 115, 143]. In addition, allergic agents such like cationic peptides [21], proteolytic active [12, 29, 58, 59, 68, 117] as well as non-proteolytic allergens [98] induce the release of IL-6, IL-8, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and monocyte chemotractant protein 1 (MCP-1). The response to proteolytically active allergens involves store-operated Ca2+ entry in epithelial cells [58, 59], and it should be noted that bacterial exotoxins also activate store-operated Ca2+ entry [128]. Other factors, which belong to danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP), like adenosine [117], prostaglandin [20] or histamine [120], initiate IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF production and release. Further, stimuli for chemokine release from airway epithelial cells are inhaled air pollutants [47, 119] and cold [108]. More recent investigations revealed airway epithelial cells as a source of IL-25, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoieitin (TSLP). This subset of cytokines is released by airway epithelial cells upon viral [15], bacterial [33] and fungal infection [48] as well as a result of allergen stimulation [23, 53, 65, 93, 97, 102].\n",

Although IL-4 and IL-13 show similar effects on TJ in these airway epithelial cell models, depending on the investigated model, they act via different pathways. In Calu3 epithelia, IL-4 is reported to activate an EGFR-dependent MAPK/ERK1/2 pathway [100], whereas in human bronchial cell derived epithelia IL-4 as well as IL-13 act via the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway [107], most likely via binding to the same receptor, namely heteromeric IL-13R\u03b1/IL-4R\u03b1 receptor [139]. Indeed, both receptor subunits have an overlapping expression pattern in lung epithelia. IL-4R\u03b1 as well as IL-13R\u03b1 both were detected in human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo [4, 46, 129, 133, 139]. IL-13R\u03b1 expression levels are increased in bronchial biopsy specimens from asthma patients which probably confers increased bronchial sensitivity to TH2 cytokines [69].",

In mouse, lung IL-13 reduces cldn18 while increasing cldn4 expression [118]. In another human bronchial epithelial cell model, IL-13 and IL-4 are reported to reduce protein density at the TJ without causing major changes in cldn1, cldn2, cldn3 and occludin protein levels [107]. Sinonasal epithelia from patients with allergic fungal rhino sinusitis, which display high TH2 cytokine levels, showed increased levels of cldn2 which most likely contributes to the tight junction leakiness [16]. Overall, IL-4 and IL-13 have high potential to damage TJ in airway epithelia.",

Elevated levels of neutrophils are a major criterion to distinguish COPD from asthma [3]. The recruitment of neutrophils is driven via direct perturbation of epithelial cells. Airborne insults such like cigarette smoke, diesel dusts, bacterial infection and allergens induce the release of chemokines IL6, IL8, TNF, IL-1, GM-SCF, MCP-1 from airway epithelial cells [12, 20, 21, 29, 47, 58, 59, 68, 77, 98, 101, 115, 117, 119, 120, 143]. Release of these cytokines either recruit neutrophils directly [140] or induce IL-17 release from TH17 cells [137]. The outcome of neutrophil enrichment is a cytokine profile, which is dominated by TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-17, IL-18, IL-32 and TGF-\u03b2 [14] (Fig. 2).",

            "text": "Especially, TNF-\u03b1 plays a major role in perturbing tight junctions in airway epithelia. TNF-\u03b1 acts via NF\u03baB, which is considered as a major regulator of tissue inflammation [99]. In mammals, the NF\u03baB family consists of five transcription factors, p50, p52, REL, RELA and RELB, which form either hetero- or homodimers. In the resting stage, NF\u03baB dimers bind proteins of the NF\u03baB inhibitor family I\u03baB. Activation of NF\u03baB signalling induces expression and release of pro-inflammatory factors such like IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8 G-CSF, GM-CSF, TNF-\u03b1, TNF\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b2 [40]. This pro-inflammatory effect of NF\u03baB is also demonstrated for airway epithelial cells [43, 67, 103, 121, 147, 148]. Activation of NF\u03baB by TNF-\u03b1 follows the canonical or classical activation pathway, which involves NEMO, IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 mediated phosphorylation of I\u03baB and its subsequent dissociation from the p50 complex [99]. The activation of the canonical or classical NF\u03baB pathway increases paracellular permeability for instance in intestinal barrier [5] and in retinal endothelia [13]. Also, in airway epithelia, TNF-\u03b1 down-regulates paracellular epithelial barrier function [25]. The genetic modulation of TNF-\u03b1 in mice revealed that TNF-\u03b1 negatively regulates tight junction proteins, namely cldn2, cldn4, cldn5 and ZO-1 in the lung, which results in increased alveolar permeability [86]. Activation of NF\u03baB also induces a pro-inflammatory response, and thus, it induces the production and release of a variety of proinflammatory factors, which potentially interferes with TJ integrity. However, NF\u03baB has the ability to modulate TJ permeability directly. Even in the absence of inflammation, inhibition of constitutive basal NF\u03baB activity in human airway epithelial cells causes an up-regulation of cldn5 expression, disturbs TJ organisation and increases paracellular permeabilty [134]. Furthermore, neutralising antibodies for IL-6 and IL-8 did not hamper TNF-\u03b1-induced perturbations of TJs in human airway epithelial cells [43]. Thus, TNF-\u03b1 has the potency to perturb TJ function directly via NF\u03baB without further need of any para- or autocrine mechanisms.",

Inflammation is a major factor, which predisposes patients to lung injury and respiratory distress syndrome [135]. However, experiments in knockout mice for several tight junction proteins revealed that those animals developed only mild lung phenotypes but they showed an increased susceptibility for lung injury [64, 75]. Besides barrier function, decreased fluid resorption across the airway epithelium is an additional susceptibility factor for lung injury and respiratory distress syndrome and worsens the clinical outcome in patients [136]. Airway and alveolar epithelia compensates for alveolar oedema formation or elevated apical surface liquid volumes by up-regulating active ion resorption [31, 39, 49, 55, 92, 123] or via increasing transcellular water permeability [110] to facilitate fluid clearance.",

Indeed, up-regulation of transepithelial transport capacity alone did not sufficiently compensate exudate formation in a mouse model of LPS-induced lung injury. Instead, exudate clearance and lung symptoms significantly improve, when transepithelial transport capacity was increased in combination with a restoration of TJ tightness [81].

Therapeutic strategies that attenuate TJ damage during inflammation and/or support TJ restoration will improve clinical outcome of patients. Elaborating the function of TJ and their molecular regulation in the lung will enhance our understanding of the lung epithelium itself and will help to develop novel strategies to treat patients with inflammatory lung diseases.",

The claudins predominantly localised at the tight junctions (TJ) (cldn3, 5, 8), localised at the tight junctions and the lateral membrane (cldn1, 4), predominantly localised basolateral from the TJ (cldn7) and localised intracellular (cldn2) are depicted. c Scheme of the alveolar epithelium. The alveolar epithelium constitutes alveolar type I (AT-I) and type II (AT-II) cells. The tight junctions between adjacent AT-I cells are narrower than those between AT-I and AT-II cells. The most abundantly expressed claudins in AT-I and AT-II cells are cldn3, 4 and 18. Their abundance sequences for each cell type are given below",

Especially IL-13 and IL-4 are the dominating factors, which damage the epithelium during TH2-driven inflammation. Neutrophil response dominates the TH2-low inflammation. It becomes activated via neutrophil recruitment by cytokines either directly released from epithelial cells or indirectly via activation of T helper cell type 17 (TH17) cells.
