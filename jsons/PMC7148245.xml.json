In the case of entity retrieval, a natural representation would however not just represent words in context of their textual neighborhood, but in context of the knowledge graph instead. Here, we would want to apply graph embeddings instead of word embeddings, where the semantic space constructed by graph embeddings does not only encode the textual context of an entity mention, but also the context as defined through the knowledge graph. Considering Wikipedia as the knowledge graph to define the entities of interest, for example, creating a graph embedding representation does not just take the entity\u2019s page itself as context, but also its anchor text, presence in lists and/or tables, etc. It is therefore likely that graph embeddings capture more of the entity\u2019s semantic roles and as a result may distinguish better between ambiguous entities than a plain word embedding based representation.",

For every query, we re-rank the results of state-of-the-art entity retrieval methods using the similarity between the entity embeddings of the candidate entities retrieved in stage one with the entity embeddings of the entities identified in the query (using an off-the-shelf entity linker). We show that re-ranking using graph embeddings improves retrieval effectiveness, and investigate how to explain this result by comparing the structure of the two types of embeddings. We also analyze why some queries are helped by this method while others are not.",

Knowledge graphs like Wikipedia enrich the representation of entities by modeling the relations between them. Methods for document retrieval such as BM25 have been applied successfully to entity retrieval. However, since knowledge bases are semi-structured resources, this structural information may be used as well, for example by viewing entities as fielded documents extracted from the knowledge graph. A well-known example of this approach applies the fielded probabilistic model (BM25F [23]), where term frequencies between different fields in documents are normalized to the length of each field. Another effective model for entity retrieval uses the fielded sequential dependence model (FSDM [27]), which estimates the probability of relevance using information from single terms and bigrams, normalized per field.",

We considered only queries with more than 10 relevant entities, for clusters large enough to compute a meaningful score. Queries are sorted on the x-axis by the number of relevant entities. The plots clearly show that the coherence score for graph-based entity embeddings is higher than for context only ones.

The data points correspond to the entities with a relevance grade higher than 0, for 12 queries with 100\u2013200 relevant entities in the ground truth data. We use Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) [16] to reduce the embeddings dimensions from 100 to two and plot the projected entities for each query. In Fig. 2b most of the clusters are overlapping in a star-like shape, while in Fig. 2a the clusters are more separated and the ones with similar search intents are close to each other; e.g., queries QALD2_te-39 and QALD2_tr-64 (which are both about companies), or INEX_LD-20120112 and INEX_LD-2009063 (which are both about war) are situated next to each other. To observe how false positive entities are placed in the embedding space, we added the 10 highest ranked false positives to the data and created new UMAP plots. In the obtained plots, false positive entities that are semantically similar to the true positive entities are close to each other. For example, two false positive entities for the query \u201cSouth Korean girl groups\u201d are: SHINee (a South Korean boy band) and Hyuna (a South Korean female singer). Both of these entities are semantically similar to the relevant entities of the query and are also placed in the vicinity of them, although they do not address the information needs of the query. This is consistent with the plots of Fig. 2 and in line with our conclusion on the effect of graph embeddings for entity-oriented search.\n",

Each of the three queries with highest gains are linked to at least one relevant entity (according to the assessments). The losses can be attributed to various sources of errors. For the query \u201cspring shoe canada\u201d, the only relevant entity belongs to the 2.4% of entities that have no embedding (cf. \u00a74.2). Query \u201cvietnam war movie\u201d is linked to entities Vietnam War and War film, with confidence scores of 0.7 and 0.2, respectively. This emphasizes Vietnam war facts instead of its movies, and could be resolved by improving the accuracy of the entity linker and/or employing a re-ranking approach that is more robust to linking errors. The query \u201cmr rourke fantasy island\u201d is linked to a wrong entity due to a spelling mistake. To conclude, errors in entity linking form one of the main reasons of performance loss in our approach.",
