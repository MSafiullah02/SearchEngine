As of 5 th May 2020, the total number of lab-confirmed UK cases was 194,990 and there have been 29,427 covid-19 associated deaths. 1 Examination of the characteristics of people hospitalised with covid- 19 and their outcomes has given some insight into the epidemiology of the disease. [2] [3] [4] Reports have suggested that ethnicity 3,5-9 and residential deprivation 10 are associated with death from covid-19, prompting a rapid review to be led by Public Health England. 11 There is also interest in whether use of antihypertensive medications that affect the renin-angiotensin system can increase the risk of severe disease. 12 However, hospital-based studies lack a population-based control group and therefore cannot accurately determine risk factors for onset of severe disease, or easily test for independence of risk factors. It remains uncertain, for example, whether ethnicity is associated with the incidence of severe covid-19 or with a worse outcome after developing severe disease. 13 Understanding population-level risk factors for covid-19 is of major interest to the general public and public health bodies, and will underpin strategies for population-wide disease prevention.",

We are considering a positive result as a surrogate for severe covid-19 disease which required hospitalisation. For participants with multiple covid-19 tests, cases were defined as all participants with at least one positive test. Assuming severe covid-19 to be relatively uncommon, we considered the remainder of the cohort who had not been tested to be controls. We excluded participants that were tested but without a positive covid-19 test in case a proportion were false negatives and given the abundance of controls already available. Data were also available for whether hospitalisation was documented on the test request form. Absence of hospitalisation documentation on the request form was not considered indicative of lack of hospitalisation given the testing policy. However, we additionally conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding cases without hospitalisation indicated on the test request form.",

We analysed all participants with available data and no sample size calculation was carried out. We compared sociodemographic, comorbidity and antihypertensive medication data between cases and controls using univariable logistic regression. We further examined antihypertensive medications together in a multivariable logistic regression model, both with and without hypertension diagnosis as a covariable. Similarly, we examined all comorbidities together in a multivariable model. Factors which were nominally significant were then all assessed together in a single multivariable model, and those with strong associations, together with age, were taken forward to the final parsimonious model. As a sensitivity analysis, we re-ran the final model following exclusion of cases without documentation of hospitalisation on the specimen request form. We did not adjust confidence intervals or P-values for multiple testing. All analyses were conducted with Stata software, version 15.1 (StataCorp). Figure 1 presents participant flow. In total, 406,793 participants were included in this analysis (605 cases and 406,188 controls). Mean age at recruitment was 56 years (standard deviation 8; range 38 to 73 years) and mean age on 1 st January 2020 was 68 years (8; 48 to 85 years). 55% were women. Table 1 presents baseline data for the cohort. Cases were significantly older, more likely to be men and more likely to be Black or South Asian. Cases had lower educational attainment and resided in more deprived locations; 40% of cases were in the most deprived quartile of Townsend deprivation index. Cases weighed more, had a higher body mass index (BMI) and a slightly higher diastolic blood pressure. Cases consumed alcohol less frequently and were more likely to be former smokers. All comorbidities were more frequent in cases. Nearly half of cases had a history of hypertension. Cases were more likely to use all classes of antihypertensive medication.

Further analyses stratifying Blacks into African and Caribbean subgroups yielded similar effects for both groups (OR 2.95 and 3.38 respectively, both P<0.001). This suggests the increased risk is evident for both groups, contrary to a report that the association may be mainly driven by Caribbeans. 6 Suggested explanations for these differences have included the higher prevalence of risk factors including diabetes, hypertension and obesity in Black and Asian people, and differing socioeconomic factors. Nonetheless, we still observed an increased risk after adjusting for all these risk factors.

The strength of this finding is particularly surprising given that the score is based on residential postcode of the individual, so has substantial measurement error. Similarly for another socioeconomic index, those with no educational qualification had increased risk compared to those with any qualifications. Possible explanations for why people with poorer socioeconomic indices might be more susceptible to severe covid-19 include that they are a surrogate measure for poorer housing and overcrowding, or need to use public transport; the higher risk of urban compared to rural communities has been reported, although many rural areas are also highly deprived on this index.

There has been much debate as to reasons for this, including the hypothesis that human pathogenic coronaviruses bind to their target cells through angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which is expressed by various epithelial cells. It is suggested that individuals who are treated with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs), such as those with hypertension, have increased expression of ACE2 which may increase the risk of developing severe and fatal covid-19. 25 In this cohort, we were able to explore in detail the use of seven different classes of antihypertension medication. Though in univariable analyses all classes of antihypertensive medication were associated with increased risk, in detailed multivariable analyses none of these were independently associated with severe covid-19 infection after adjusting for hypertension history, age, sex and ethnicity; rather it was the number of antihypertensive medications in use that was significantly related, which is probably a surrogate for severity of hypertension. This suggests it is more likely that hypertension per se, in particular hypertension severe enough to require multiple medications, that is the main risk factor for severe covid-19. These results lend some reassurance to the consensus reports and reviews 12, 26, 27 that there is no strong evidence to implicate ACE inhibitors or ARB use in covid-19 severity and that individuals should continue with such medication to control hypertension. There were no strong associations of systolic or diastolic blood pressure with covid-19, suggesting that a history of hypertension or use of antihypertensives are more robust indicators of risk than one-off blood pressure measures. Nevertheless, questions remain as to why hypertension should be such a strong risk factor for covid-19.",

Several mechanisms for obesity-mediated risk have been suggested, including higher propensity to thrombosis, poorer immune response or excess inflammatory response. 29 Obesity decreases key operating lung volumes and this effect appears particularly pronounced in men. 30 We observed a strong association with increased risk of severe covid-19 in ever smokers, indicating a harmful impact of smoking on the risk of developing severe covid-19. This risk was mainly observed in the former rather than current smokers; this could be related to the low prevalence of current smokers in this cohort, or that participants still smoking represent a healthier subset of all prior smokers in that some former smokers may have given up due to poorer health.

While older age is a strong risk factor for covid-19 mortality, age in UK Biobank (which has a restricted age range) may not be a risk factor for acquiring covid-19.

We identified cases through the national Public Health database which collects data for all covid-19 tests, both positive and negative. After the initial contact tracing policy, from 16 th March 2020, testing was reserved for individuals hospitalised with covid-19. This was due to limited test availability and to protect services from being overwhelmed by people with mild disease. Individuals identified with positive covid-19 tests from the UK Biobank cohort therefore represent the hospitalised and most severe cases. There will be individuals in the comparison control population who are susceptible to severe covid-19 infection but who have been uninfected to date. These numbers are likely to be relatively small compared to the overall denominator. In any case, misclassification of controls is likely only to attenuate any associations observed and would not explain our significant findings. Furthermore, our results are in keeping with hospital-based cohort reports. While this is one of the first studies to prospectively examine community-level associations with severe infection, we did not have data to assess subsequent mortality; future linkage to hospital outcome data will enable these analyses. While the diversity of the UK population permits adequately powered analyses of ethnicity, our findings may not apply to non-UK populations.",
