A/J mice recover from a mild disease after 4-6 days of infection and the BALB/c mice develop an acute hepatitis and die after 3-4 days of infection. In view of studying the MHV3 binding to cells or cell extracts, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like virusbinding assay, preparing microplates with L929 cells, A/J or BALB/c mouse macrophages and also with proteins extracted from these cells. Higher MHV3 bindings were observed to proteins of BALB/c macrophages than to the A/J ones. The interferon-g (IFN-g) activation led to a reduction of MHV3 binding only to proteins of resistant A/J mouse macrophages. Our experiments contribute to the hypothesis that IFN-g activation of macrophages plays an important role against MHV3 infection by downregulating the expression of viral receptors.",

            "text": "Soon after I (Carlos A. Pereira) established my new viral immunology group at the Instituto Butantan, S\u00e3o Paulo, in 1987, I contacted Ivan Lefkovits at the Basel Institute for Immunology to ask him about the possibilities to identify macrophage proteins by 2D-gel electrophoresis. Since I was in Strasbourg and Freiburg, Ivan invited me to Basel to discuss the issue. I was especially pleased by the fact that the word 'macrophage' did not turn off Ivan's interest -the Institute was well known for the Jerneian neglect of macrophages. I was not only surprised by the friendly welcome in Ivan's laboratory, but was also impressed by Ivan's willingness to listen to our explanations -interrupted only by questions concerning the heterogeneity of macrophage populations (and also life span and protein synthetic capacity). We agreed to perform some exploratory experiments, and this initial good contact rapidly turned into an active collaboration. Ivan accepted my PhD student, Maria A. Lucchiari, to his laboratory, and in 1992, we published a paper showing that the pattern of protein synthesized in the liver was profoundly perturbed upon mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) infection [1] , and that some gene products related to the induction of antiviral state in macrophages resistant and sensitive to interferon-g (IFN-g) could be readily characterized [2] . These proteomic studies -done years before the term 'proteomics' was invented -represented a turning point in my approach to understanding the basis of anti-MHV state induced by IFN-g. A few years later, supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, we have found that IFN-g was capable of inducing a downregulation of the main viral receptor only in macrophages originated from resistant mice, explaining at least in part the cellular and molecular basis of mouse resistance to MHV infection [3, 4] .",

Among the MHV, several isolates although with a high degree of similarity regarding their structure and composition, show important differences of physiopathology. Hence, the MHV3 can induce an acute hepatitis depending on the genetic background of the host. Even low doses of MHV3 induce liver necrosis and high mortality among the BALB/c mice, but the A/J mice are capable of clearing the virus showing resistance to the infection [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The MHVA59 infection, on the other hand, induces encephalitis with chronic demyelination in several mouse strains [11] . Resistance/susceptibility to MHV3 is expressed in a cellular level by a partial restriction of MHV3 replication observed only in A/J mouse macrophages, mainly after IFN-g activation. In a molecular level, we have indications that the expression of viral receptors plays an essential role in the restriction of replication. Only resistant A/J macrophages show a decreased expression of the gene encoding for the principal viral receptor (Bgp 1a ) [3] . Our quantitative biology studies [1, 4] showing upregulated and downregulated proteins and genes in resistant and susceptible macrophages opened a great perspective for investigations of the biological role of these cells and have also confirmed the downregulation of an MHV3 receptor gene by IFN-g activation [4] .",

            "text": "Since the viral infection normally requires the adhesion of viral particles to the cell surface and internalization of the viral genome, several studies were carried out to demonstrate and characterize viral receptors on target cells. Several viruses were shown to enter the cells by using more than one receptor and isolates of MHV are capable of infecting different cell lineages using different receptors [12] by fusion and leading to cell lysis. MHV binds to a glycoprotein on the cell membrane through the 180-kDa trimer of their S-glycoprotein resulting in a fusion of their envelope with the cell membrane [13] . The main MHV receptors were characterized as glycoproteins of the carcinoembrionic antigen -the biliary glycoproteins Bgp 1a and Bgp 2 [14] . Hence, during the MHV infection, the receptor recognition by the viral S-glycoprotein confers the specificity and tissue tropism, although the subsequent steps like the membrane fusion and replication may also contribute to the degree of resistance/susceptibility [15] . Studies aiming to clarify the interaction between virus and cell-membrane proteins may represent an outstanding contribution to the understanding of resistance mechanisms.",

It correlates with previous data showing a partial restriction of MHV3 replication only in resistant A/J mouse macrophages upon IFN-g activation [3, 9] . For the MHVA59, a coronavirus that induces a quite distinct pathological process, we do not observe the same pattern of resistance/susceptibility for A/J and BALB/c mice as we do for the MHV3. In this case, we also did not observe a difference in virus binding to protein extracts from macrophages, what reinforces our hypothesis of relationship between MHV3 binding, restriction of replication and resistance in A/J and BALB/c mice.",
