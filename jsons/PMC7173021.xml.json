Two highly infectious coronaviruses (SARS and MERS) hit the headlines at about ten years' intervals. At the same time, the media provided ample coverage of seasonal influenza A virus outbreaks, such as H5N1, known as \u201cbird flu\u201d and considered the world's largest current pandemic threat around 2006, the 2009 \u201cswine flu\u201d pandemic caused by H1N1, or the threatening features of H7N9 in 2013. Shortly afterwards, the EBOLA virus (EBOV) went on a rampage in western Africa, killing over 11,000 individuals and annihilating decades of fragile economic progress. More recently, the Zika virus (ZIKV) and its neurological complications reached Latin America in 2017 with a huge epidemic in Brazil.",

Thus far, all candidates for pandemics are zoonoses, and the current meat-heavy agro-alimentary industry contributes significantly to the maintenance of animal reservoirs and an evolutionary playground for many pathogens, while the close contact between animals and humans facilitates the emergence of animal-to-human transmission as well as the drive towards antibiotic resistance. This trend is bound to continue, as food production needs to match the rapidly growing global population, which in turn also favours transmission of microbial pathogens. Furthermore, climate change is constantly broadening the geographic range of a variety of arthropod vectors, and globalization not only shuttles men and merchandise around the planet but also infectious agents. Lastly, let's not forget the pathogens that resist all our attempts at eradication. Despite almost three decades of massive investment into finding a cure and a vaccine for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the latter keeps being one step ahead, principally through phenomenal mutation strategies, nicely summarized in this issue by Nomaguchi et al. [1].",

And as for parasites, Low et al. suggest taking advantage of a relatively-unknown organelle: the apicoplast, the exclusive property of Apicomplexan parasites such as Plasmodium. This specificity plus the prokaryotic features of the plastid make it an interesting target for drugs. As there is still no efficient vaccine against malaria, the authors recommend that we turn our attention to the plastid. Interestingly, many drugs affecting the apicoplast lead to a \u201cdelayed death\u201d phenomenon, where only the second generation of parasites die - theoretically, the ideal conditions for the development for a so-called \u201csuicide vaccine\u201d [5].",

And even when the complexity of the pathogen world is narrowed down to \u201conly\u201d the influenza A virus (IAV), things stay pretty convoluted, as Downey et al. point out in their review. They emphasize the importance of using in vivo models rather than cell cultures because communication between pulmonary macrophages and epithelial cells shape the kinetics of cell death during infection, which are in turn crucial for regulating the antiviral responses [7]. This view is supported by Brizic et al., who describe insights on the neurological damage caused by the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gained from a mouse model [8]. But even when down to one receptor, complexity has still the final say. In this research paper in our collection of reviews, the group of Ojcius unravels the versatile role of the mitochondrial NOD-like receptor NLRX1 in the modulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome: it activates the NLRP3 inflammasome upon infection by pathogens but can dampen its effects in the presence of mere commensal pathogens [9].",

Quite the contrary - the advent of single cell RNA-sequencing added a new awareness of extreme complexity to the entire system. This aspect is elegantly discussed by Weigel and Dersch. Pathogens live in a constantly changing and mostly hostile environment, where resourcefulness and rapid adaptation are core requirements for survival. Hence, a mixed population is best suited to face sudden challenges. For that matter, another profound dogma change of the past decades has been the rehabilitation of \u201cjunk DNA\u201d and \u201cnoise\u201d thanks to the discovery of a huge number of long noncoding RNAs and pervasive transcription. Just as the latter is now considered raw material for evolution and adaptation, stochastic fluctuations in gene expression, exacerbated in turn by slight differences in the microenvironment and feedback loops, drive the emergence of subpopulations in a genetically identical population and can be considered a virulence strategy [14].",

A similar logic underlies the review by Vernel-Pauillac and Werts, who combine the latest insights into how Leptospira interrogans escapes the immune system with the most recent tactics for drug and vaccine development. Notably, the authors explain how computational and statistical approaches as well as the CRISPR/Cas9 technology could assist vaccine design [21]. The team of Oliveiro reminds us that sometimes the foe can become a friend, at least in bits and pieces. They make a good case for the use of serine protease inhibitors containing a Kunitz domain normally used by helminth parasites to dampen the host immune system, but which could come in very handy when the latter goes over the top [22]. In turn, Olds et al. plead for the revival of an \u201cancient universal stress molecule\u201d - abscisic acid (ABA). The versatile stress signalling molecule in plants and animals seems indeed to have many applications: being essential for T\n.\ngondii growth and development, it might be a therapeutic target; in mammals, the hormone has displayed beneficial properties in a wide range of processes, including glucose metabolism, stem cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, inflammation and depression [23].",
