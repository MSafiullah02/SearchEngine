However, it remains uncertain as to how the virus-host interaction triggers the inflammatory response resulting in vascular leakage, the hallmark of DHF/DSS, as evidenced by haemoconcentration and/or effusions in the pleural or peritoneal spaces. The fact that the Cuban, Caribbean, and African black populations which share a common ancestry are protected against DHF explains at least partly the role of host genetic variability in this disease susceptibility [8].",

[9] suggested the involvement of some host candidate genes associated with dengue infection namely, CXCR3 chemokine receptor gene and its ligands chemokine CXCL10 (IP10) and CXCL11 (I-TAC). These genes are commonly involved in the NFkB pathway. Production of these chemokines lead to recruitment of CXCR3 expressing T-cells and NK cells. On top of the in vivo study, earlier studies on gene expression also suggest the involvement of these chemokines in SARS, West Nile virus encephalitis and chronic Hepatitis C patients [10], [11], [12]. We hypothesized that the differential clinical expression of the selected chemokines in different individuals are related to the genetic variation of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 gene, and its ligands CXCL10 and CXCL11. We therefore, attempted to investigate if the risk of acquiring vascular leakage \u2013 the hallmark symptom of progression to severe dengue \u2013 is attributed to genetic variations in these candidate genes.",

Laboratory confirmation, namely IgM serological test was carried out at the respected hospitals. These tests were independently repeated at least twice to confirm the results in our laboratory in addition to IgG serological test.
