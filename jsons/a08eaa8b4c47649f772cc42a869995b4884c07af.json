E-mail: angie.au.yong.p.s@singhealth.com.sg Keywords: airway management; COVID-19; extubation; infection control; intubation; operating room; prevention EditordCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization 1 on March 11, 2020 because of its rapid worldwide spread. In the operating theatre (OT), anaesthetists are taking precautions for every patient to minimise perioperative viral transmission as infected patients can be asymptomatic. 2 Airway manipulation poses a high risk of viral transmission to humans within close contact because of the proximity of the respiratory secretions that can aerosolise from coughing and gagging. 3 Supplementary Fig 1 from Chan and colleagues 4 shows the dispersion of respiratory particles: the dispersion distance of exhaled air can range from 42 to 99 mm, and from coughing bouts after intubation up to 460 mm.",

            "text": "The Singapore General Hospital instituted guidelines for airborne and contact precautions, including (i) environmental, reducing staff during airway manipulation, regular disinfection and sterilisation, sufficient air exchange time; and (ii) personal protective equipment (PPE). We identified a potential shortcoming in that none of these measures reduced the production and spread of respiratory secretions, which contain the bulk of the viral burden. Decontamination of the OT depends on adequate cleaning of OT equipment and reduction of viral load by high-frequency air changes. There is a long period between intubation and extubation, in which respiratory droplets remain on surfaces before cleaning. We describe some practical innovations that anaesthetists can consider integrating into their workflow. These innovations are not meant to replace PPE, but aim to reduce the cumulative risk of perioperative viral transmission to all the personnel in the OT. In countries where doctors are advised to reuse PPE because of shortages, these may afford an extra degree of protection.",

A videolaryngoscope and tracheal tube can be passed under the plastic tent for intubation.

This protective tent can be modified for use in ICUs during suctioning, bronchoscopy, and other aerosol-generating procedures. The screen is similar to the tent and provides a tighter seal.
