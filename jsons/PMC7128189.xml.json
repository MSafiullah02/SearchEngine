Among confirmed cases, fever, cough and upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms occur first, followed within a week by progressive lower respiratory tract distress and lymphopaenia [5]. Patients often present to a hospital with pneumonia (or worse) and secondary bacterial infections have been reported [5], [6]. Disease can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan system failure [5]. MERS has killed approximately 40% of reported cases but this is very likely to be an inflated value [7]. No specific antivirals or vaccines exist; a range of therapeutic options have been tried with no evidence to date of clear or consistent benefit.",

Studies of health worker or household contacts of confirmed cases, adult blood donors or children hospitalized with unspecified lower respiratory tract disease have not reported neutralizing antibody to MERS-CoV [12], [13], [14]. Similarly, human sera from animal workers have not contained neutralizing antibodies [13], [15]. Here, antibody absence may reflect sampling from 2012 or earlier, before MERS-CoV had established itself. Alternatively, current serological assays may not be sufficiently sensitive to detect seroconversion in mild and subclinical disease, or such cases may not mount an immune response. However, a recent large study of sera, mostly collected after 2012, successfully identified seroconversions among 0.15% of human sera from six of the Kingdom's 13 provinces. Antibodies were present more frequently among those occupationally exposed to animals, but often without a remembered history of illness [16]. Given the low proportion, it is not surprising that a much smaller number of sera collected in 2014 did not show evidence of seroconversion among camel herders and others despite close camel contact [17]. MERS-CoV RNA is shed from mild or subclinical infections, explaining how MERS-CoV transmission could side-step the camel and also why fewer than half of human cases report camel contact [2], [18]. The description of a health worker who shed viral RNA from the upper respiratory tract for more than 40 days without signs of disease further supports the concept of occult spread [9].",
