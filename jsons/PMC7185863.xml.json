Picornaviruses share a common replication strategy requiring the translation of a polyprotein precusor that is cleaved by virally encoded proteases into the proteins that make up the viral capsid and replication machinery (Leong, Cornell, & Semler, 2002; Mason et al., 2003). The conserved 3C protease, the only picornaviral protease common to all genera, is a key player in this process and is a potential anti-viral drug target. Recent investigations have unearthed new details about the proteolytic and other roles of FMDV 3Cpro and will be the focus of this review.",

            "text": "The catalytic mechanism of picornaviral 3C proteases is an enduring puzzle (Skern et al., 2002). Although sequence alignments indicated that 3C proteases had a Cys-His-Asp/Glu catalytic triad akin to the Ser-His-Asp triad found in serine proteases, early crystallographic work highlighted intriguing differences between HRV and HAV 3Cpro on the one hand and chymotrypsin-like serine proteases on the other. In particular, the structures showed that the third member of the triad (Glu in HRV; Asp in HAV) did not interact appropriately with the catalytic His residue and therefore suggested that it had a lesser or non-existent role in catalysis than is the case for serine proteases (Allaire, Chernaia, Malcolm, & James, 1994; Bergmann et al., 1997, Matthews et al., 1994). However, the latest structural work on FMDV and HAV 3Cpro (Birtley et al., 2005, Sweeney et al., 2006, Yin et al., 2005) and on related 3C-like viral proteases (Phan et al., 2002; Zeitler, Estes, & Prasad, 2006) helps to establish that this class of enzymes all possess a Cys-His-Asp/Glu triad in the active site that is vey similar in conformation to the Ser-His-Asp triad found in chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (Hedstrom, 2002) (Fig. 2b). These structural observations argue strongly in favour of a significant role for the third member of the triad in picornaviral 3C proteases and are consistent both with its strict conservation as Asp or Glu in 3Cpro sequences and the observation that substitution of this residue is invariably severely detrimental to catalytic activity (Grubman, Zellner, Bablanian, Mason, & Piccone, 1995; Kean, Teterina, Marc, & Girard, 1991).",

Biochemical studies have found that PV 3Cpro does not possess a Cys-His thiolate-imidazolium ion pair in the active site and have therefore ruled out a catalytic mechanism similar to papain-like cysteine proteases (Sarkany, Szeltner, & Polgar, 2001). Nevertheless, definitive evidence for a general base catalytic mechanism, as found for chymotrypsin-like serine proteases, has yet to be obtained (Sarkany & Polgar, 2003). It is also still unclear why some picornavirus 3C proteases have Glu as the third member of the triad when this residue is almost invariably an Asp in serine proteases (Birtley et al., 2005). An intriguing outlying observation is that the 3C-like main protease from coronavirus only contains a Cys-His pair in the active site; the position normally occupied by Asp is taken by a hydrophobic residue (Cys or Val) (Anand et al., 2002). Clearly further work will be required to make a definitive determination of the proteolytic mechanism of FMDV 3Cpro and related enzymes.",

However, within that specificity framework there are some interesting variations. Although HRV and PV 3Cpro almost invariably cleave sequences with P1\u2032-Gly, HAV 3Cpro tolerates larger residues at this position and, in addition, exhibits a preference for a small hydrophilic residue at P2 (Seipelt et al., 1999). FMDV 3Cpro shows similar variability at P1\u2032 but is unusual in also being able to cleave sequences with P1-Gln or P1-Glu at broadly similar rates (Birtley et al., 2005); this reflects the fact that in the viral polyprotein, there are five 3Cpro cleavage junctions with P1-Gln and five with P1-Glu. Experimental analyses confirm the importance of P4, P1 and P1\u2032 positions in peptides cleaved by FMDV 3Cpro but also suggests important roles for P2 and P4\u2032 positions (Birtley et al., 2005).",

This reveals some previously undetected correlations between different positions in the sequences recognised by FMDV 3Cpro. Thus, sequences with P1-Gln typically also have P2-Lys and a largely hydrophobic residue at P1\u2032 (Leu, Ile, Thr). In contrast, in sequences with P1-Glu the preference for P2-Lys is reduced but there is strong selectivity for a small amino acid (Gly or Ser) at P1\u2032. This suggests that interactions between different subsites in the peptide binding cleft of FMDV 3Cpro may be important for specificity and, in particular, that recognition of the P1 residue is influenced by the P2 and P1\u2032 positions. The sequence specificity identified for junctions with P1-Glu (Fig. 2c) helps to explain why the sequence VRAE/VQ in eIF4AI is cleaved by FMDV 3Cpro, but the closely related sequence in eIF4AII (VRNE/MQ) is not (Li, Ross-Smith, Proud, & Belsham, 2001).",

At present we do not even properly understand the structural basis for selectivity of P1-Gln in most 3C proteases, since the residues that apparently specify P1-Gln in PV, HRV and HAV 3Cpro are also conserved in FMDV 3Cpro (Birtley et al., 2005), which can accommodate Gln or Glu at this position.",

Structural studies of the mature 3C proteases from other picornaviruses suggest that cis-cleavage at the N-terminus of 3Cpro occurs more readily than cleavage at the C-terminus since it requires less distortion of the precursor to position the N-terminal cleavage junction in the active site (Bergmann et al., 1997; Khan, Khazanovich-Bernstein, Bergmann, & James, 1999; Matthews et al., 1994). This hypothesis is consistent with the requirement for a functional 3CD precursor (Leong et al., 2002). FMDV 3Cpro may well behave similarly although it should be noted that it has a longer C-terminus (by 7\u201313 residues) than other picornavirus 3C proteases (Birtley et al., 2005), which may allow for enhanced manoeuvrability of the C-terminal cleavage junction in the precursor. Again this is an area where more work is needed; for example, the crystal structure of a FMDV 3CD precursor (proteolytically inactivated by mutagenesis) may help to test models of polyprotein processing since it should reveal the location of the cleavage junction prior to proteolysis.",

It removes the N-terminal 20 amino acids from histone H3, probably leading to a down-regulation of transcription (Falk et al., 1990). A similar depression of transcription is achieved by PV 3CDpro by a different route: this precursor protease targets both the TATA-box binding protein and transcription factor IIIC (Skern et al., 2002). It is not known if different picornaviruses target similar components of the transcription machinery. Most picornaviruses also inhibit host\u2013cell translation initiation, primarily by cleavage of eIF4G. Although the viral leader protease (Lpro) cleaves eIF4G to shut-off host cell protein synthesis in FMDV-infected cells, FMDV 3Cpro has also been reported to cleave both eIF4G and eIF4A (Belsham, Mclnerney, & Ross-Smith, 2000; Li et al., 2001). However, this occurs at relatively late stages of viral infection and its contribution to viral replication has yet to be elucidated.",

During the initation of replication of positive strand RNA synthesis, the 3B protein (VPg) is uridylylated to generate a VPg-pU-pU precursor that acts as a primer for positive strand synthesis on a negative strand RNA template. The formation of this precursor is critically dependent on the assembly of a protein\u2013RNA complex involving a conserved cis-acting replication element (located within the 5\u2032-untranslated region of the FMDV genome), the precursor 3CD and the 3D polymerase (Nayak, Goodfellow, & Belsham, 2005). Follow-up studies indicate that the formation of a functional 3B uridylylation complex in FMDV infected cells depends on the RNA binding activity of the 3C moiety of 3CD (Nayak et al., 2006). The RNA binding surface, as in other picornavirus 3C proteases, maps to a conserved basic patch on the dorsal surface of the enzyme, opposite to the active site (Fig. 2d). This patch is centred on a generally conserved 95KFRDl99 sequence but also contains other basic residues. FMDV 3Cpro can functionally substitute for 3CD within in vitro uridylylation assays but at much lower efficiency. Clearly, the structure of the complex would help elucidate the mechanism in greater detail.",

The elucidation of the structure of FMDV 3Cpro paves the way for structure-based drug design. However, this is clearly a difficult road since the structures of HRV and HAV 3Cpro were determined over 10 years ago and have yet to yield commercially viable antiviral drugs for the associated diseases.
