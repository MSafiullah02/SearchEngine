Thus, MERS-CoV load measurements can be clinically useful for monitoring disease activity, clinical progress, response to therapy, and cure, and they can also be used as a marker of prognosis [7\u201311]. The ideal approach to determining the most appropriate clinical sample for making a diagnosis, ascertaining the viral load, and obtaining the optimal genome fraction requires understanding of the natural history of the viral infection [9\u201311]. Data from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic showed low SARS-CoV loads in the upper respiratory tract and high viral loads in the lower respiratory tract [9\u201311]. The natural history of SARS-CoV infection was unique in that test results for nasopharyngeal specimens were often negative during the first week of infection, and the highest positivity rates occurred during the second week of illness, peaking at approximately day 10. This allowed definition of which and when during the course of infection clinical specimens will test positive [5, 11]. The low virus detection rate in nasopharyngeal specimens early in the course of SARS-CoV infection illustrates the importance of optimal timing of specimen collection and the optimal specimen type for diagnosis.",

In other common respiratory viral infections, such as influenza, the viral load peaks soon after the onset of symptoms [4]. There were several features of SARS that distinguished it from other viral causes of RTIs [7, 11]. The pathogenic potential, natural history, and transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV require definition before the optimal sample type can be ascertained. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 was identified as the receptor for MERS-CoV [25], and these receptors are expressed on primary human bronchiolar lung tissue; thus, the virus is able to infect lower respiratory tract tissues. Gastrointestinal symptoms are also present in patients infected with MERS-CoV [13].",

For detecting MERS-CoV, the choice of the most appropriate respiratory tract specimen for diagnostic purposes remains to be determined and requires further study of several respiratory tract sample types obtained at the same time from the same patient. Further studies are required to (1) define the natural history of MERS-CoV infection in humans and the viral load kinetics over time in various respiratory tract samples; 2) determine MERS-CoV shedding in various nonrespiratory clinical sample types, such as urine, stool, blood, or effusions from the time of infection to recovery or death; and 3) correlate viral load with intensive care unit admission and death as a composite end point. These data are required to shed further light on MERS-CoV pathogenesis, ascertain the optimal clinical samples for diagnosis, and guide optimal infection control measures. Viral load measurements could also serve as biomarkers for monitoring response to therapy, disease activity, and predict prognosis.",
