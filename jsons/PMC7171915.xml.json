We further discuss the reasons for the increased demand for bushmeat, both as a response to food insecurity and as a response to a demand for exclusive, elitist consumption. We then address the relations that occur between the commodification of wild animals and the traditional systems of knowledge and practices that have sustained continuity in wild animal use.

Processes of land use change toward intensification have in many cases led to increased contact between fruit bats and domestic animals (e.g., while roosting in trees in and around livestock paddocks, feeding on fruits in orchards) and humans (e.g., bats drinking and urinating in open palm sap containers) as well as to increased opportunities for viral spillover. The disruption of bat ecology also results in increasing numbers of fruit bats seeking food in suburban and urban areas and increasing human and livestock contact with them or their fluids [22]. All this has largely increased the probability of viral spillover from bats to humans and/or to intermediate hosts (wild or domesticated) with which bats come into contact, with global connectivity then amplifying its human to human transmission. At the same time, the consumption of bats has spread to a wider pool of urban consumers, and in southern China bats are found regularly in markets [23], where they may be in cages in proximity to other wild animals. While bats were traditionally hunted and consumed within locally based and ecologically attuned systems of knowledge, and these systems of knowledge often have norms in place to avoid over-harvesting, the commodification of bats, as with many other wild animals, leads to a race for maximum extraction that will result in further loss of biodiversity, further loss of cultural diversity of all those populations relying on bats, and further disruption of the bat-dependent ecological cycles, with further ecological turbulence.",

The globalization of the world economy (high human population densities, global transport and movement of people, spreading of information via the internet, including gastronomic information and recipes involving wild animals) has sustained these drivers and facilitates human-to-human transmission.",

This can be understood as a reflection of the encroachment of human activities into forests and of the consequent disruption of local ecologies, including the ecology of viruses and their hosts. Indeed, changes in the ecology of reservoir species can have a great impact on the emergence of zoonotic diseases. Deforestation and urbanization have likely contributed to the emergence of the Ebola virus in West Africa. The encroachment of human activities into forests provides numerous paths for the transmission of viruses from bats to intermediate (including livestock) hosts. The Hindra viruses of East Australia originated from bats and horses sharing the same environment, i.e., a horse pasture. Bats adapted to roosting in trees in pastures after the forest in which they lived was logged and transformed to the point that it could no longer sustain bat populations. Similarly, the Nipah virus appeared in Malaysia in connection with a spike in intensive commercial pig husbandry, a condition that facilitated the transmission of the virus from the bat reservoir to a swine intermediate host, and from there to humans [24]. Bat populations, displaced by shrinking forests and forest ecosystems increasingly deprived of species, may turn to fruit orchards for food and roosting, thus increasing the chance of transmission to other animals and to humans when partially eaten fruits are subsequently consumed.",

Humans become infected after exposure to infected camels or consuming the raw milk and meat of camels. Although the dynamics of transmission from bats to camels are not yet understood, they may involve the increased contact that occurs between the two species in conditions of sedentary (versus nomadic) and stabled (versus open-air) camel husbandry, conditions in which bats could roost inside stables and spread viruses to the camels below with their urine, feces, and droplets.",

Roasted, boiled, smoked, or dried, bushmeat provides proteins and fat to rural and forest inhabitants, as well as cash from its commercialization [28]. The history of AIDS tells us today that HIV-1 and HIV-2 originated from SIV, a virus that was transmitted from non-human primates to humans in Central Africa at the beginning of the 20th century. The evidence that humans who participated in bushmeat hunting, trading, and butchering could easily acquire SIV, and that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession allowed it to mutate into HIV, is robust [29\u201331]. Some studies have postulated that high-risk transmission channels, allowing the virus to adapt to humans, emerged with colonialism and the growth of large African cities, in connection to a spread of prostitution [32, 33].",

It is therefore worth noting that in several parts of Africa the demand and consumption of bushmeat has increased as a consequence of the collapse of artisanal and small-scale fisheries due to industrial overfishing (from China, Korea, the EU) and fish population collapse along African coasts [38, 39]1.",

This, connected with a demand for these foods in growing towns and cities, has driven additional extraction and the national and international trade of live animals and their meat [40, 41]. This all results in high demand for animal-derived products sold in formal and informal, rural and urban open-air markets as well as along streets and roadsides across many tropical and subtropical areas [42, 43]. The resulting market pressure on the species and on local communities often brings about the erosion of norms and taboos (e.g., regarding wild animal hunting and harvesting), the shifting of the economic value chain and of control over the resource from local producers to outsiders, the adoption of invasive technologies for harvesting, and an increase in wealth inequality within communities, thus threatening both social and environmental sustainability and resilience at multiple levels [41]. With increasing commodification of traditional and ecologically attuned systems of knowledge, these systems have often been bent to market imperatives for short-term gain, cheap resources, and cheap labor. Unsanctioned and poorly sanctioned processes of commodification (for some species all the way to wildlife farming) are threatening species previously consumed for subsistence, their population and habitat. For example, the mopane caterpillar, harvested from the mopane tree across southern Africa, has become a commodity sold in towns and cities as well as exported to Europe, and this has created stress and threats to local lives and livelihoods (as people witness the commodification of an important subsistence and seasonal resource), to the species itself (customary norms for sustainability discarded), to the mopane tree that hosts the caterpillar (trees are felled to reach caterpillars high up the canopy), and to the same savannah ecosystems of which the mopane tree is a keystone species (providing critical food to elephants, who in turn shape the ecosystem with their presence) [44]. With regard to mammals, the trade of live and recently slaughtered wild animals in \u201cwet markets\u201d (markets where live animals and freshly slaughtered meat are sold, and so named because of the large quantities of water used to slosh the floors) across many tropical and subtropical areas of the world (e.g., Peru, South-East Asia and China, Western Africa) has largely increased contact between different species of wild animals, and between them and humans. Much of this trade relates to the demand for products used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Traditional Chinese Medicine makes large use of animal products, creating an environmental impact as well as health hazards [45]. Because this medicine is widespread and growing, there is increasingly higher demand for wildlife species and for the products obtained from them [46].",

While this process intensifies the actual consumption of products, the \u201cnew rich\u201d are the ones that are the most eager in mimicking [49]. This phenomenon is more than ever evident today, in a global society that is highly unequal and confers prestige to wealthier people [50], in particular in China; a country that more than others has experienced fast economic growth and the rise of new affluent social groups [51, 52]. While the new social status is generally marked by purchasing houses and luxury goods [53\u201355], food and foodways are also transformed.

            "text": "Asia is an epicenter for wildlife trafficking and wild animal consumption. In countries like China, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Thailand, the social status, prestige, and gastronomic exclusivity deriving from ye wei (literally \u201cwild taste\u201d) is the main driver of the demand for wild meat, particularly among the wealthiest and those aspiring to be. In the cuisine of Asian countries, ye wei refers to bushmeat and game including wild and exotic animals. Historically, members of the imperial courts in the dynastic eras used to request ye wei, including symbolic and magical animals or animal parts, for their meals. Nowadays, ye wei is widely sold in Asian wet markets, offered at restaurants, and requested by wealthy consumers because of their rarity and cost. In a recent survey conducted in China, almost a third of the respondents reported consuming wildlife, with consumers with higher incomes and higher education levels having higher wildlife consumption rates [57]. The rapid urbanization and shift to a market economy in these countries, and the subsequent emergence of hundreds of millions of potential middle-class consumers wanting to emulate elitist foodways, has boosted the demand for wild meat, trade of wild animals, attendance of wet markets, and food and medicinal consumption of wild animals. These animals are sourced legally or illegally, from the wild or from wildlife farms. A source for these species is the thousands of wildlife farms that have arisen in China during the last twenty years, which can be seen as attempts to intensify \u201cwildlife production.\u201d These farms raise a number of animals for food, from peacocks to porcupines and civets, which are often believed to have powerful medicinal and magical/symbolic properties. Indeed, the SARS coronavirus has been shown to use farmed civets as intermediate hosts before jumping to humans [58, 59]. Rhino horns, tiger bones, civet and pangolin meat, porcupines, bamboo rats, totoaba bladder, shark fins\u2019 soup, and roasted bats are notable examples of this demand for wild luxury foods and/or medicinal items. Commercial chains run deep into forests to provision wealthy consumers by selling to restaurants, at \u201cwet markets,\u201d or through online platforms, where consumers can also find recipes and cooking advice. In recent years, the trade of wildlife for food and medicine has spread via the Internet, where virtual platforms and ecommerce websites sell wild animals or products obtained from them.",

Pangolins have long been hunted for food and traditional medicine across Asia and West and Central Africa [62, 63]. In Ghana, for example, people traditionally use different parts (scales, bones, head, and meat) for different purposes including spiritual protection, rheumatisms, infertility, and convulsions, while the meat was used for preparing charms for chiefs or tribal leaders [64]. In Sierra Leone, the scales, head, meat, and tail are prevalently used for food as well as for spiritual protection and to treat skin diseases and digestive problems [65]. Pangolins and their scales are similarly used (e.g., to ward off evil spirits and witchcraft) in Nigeria [66\u201368] and in Benin [69], as well as across India and Pakistan [70, 71].",

This demand causes over-exploitation that, coupled with habitat loss, threatens the very survival of the species used. Pangolin scales are regarded as a medicinal panacea (like rhino horns, and like rhino horns they are made of keratin), and their meat is considered a delicacy. The demand for pangolins in China is met by an illegal trade that is lucrative and on the rise, lately attracting wildlife traffickers who used elephant ivory as their prime generator of profits. The demand for pangolin meat and scales, due to increasing conspicuous consumption by the Asian middle class, has driven pangolins to the verge of extinction [73]. From all forested corners of the tropics, pangolins are transported to Asian markets, where stressed and likely immune depressed pangolins are caged with many other species, and also with their own pathogens. This has emptied forests of pangolins: a steady decrease of pangolins, and wildlife in general, in African forests has been reported by local hunters and traditional healers in studies in Southwestern Nigeria [67] and in Cameroon [74].\n",

These commodification processes often end up severing the links that existed between resource extraction and the carrying capacity and ecology of the surrounding environment. Populations lose their raw materials and spiritual attachment to their own restricted resource catchments, and these catchments become providers of both cash for hunters and highly-sought after products for global consumers. In the process, the same traditional knowledge, norms, and practices that have sustained a low-rate harvest of materially and culturally meaningful species change: while the knowledge and skills related to hunting and to the behavior of, for example, pangolins remain key to providing these animals to the market, the norms that regulated their harvest collapse under the pressure of demand, livelihood commodification, and the shift of decision-making from communities to individuals and outsiders. Indigenous and traditional knowledge, norms, and beliefs that regulate human access to different species in different places at different times are nonetheless central to biodiversity conservation [86]. Indeed, traditional knowledge, its nuanced understanding of ecological relationships, and the limits it sets to over-harvesting are of great importance for biodiversity conservation and for local livelihoods [87, 88], as well as being an attribute of communities with continuity in resource use practices.",

Each use of a species does not have just a material significance, but rather it is embedded in cultural and social systems that give meaning to that use and put that meaning into the context of the wider ecology on which communities depend and about which have deep knowledge. When animals and their products are divorced from their cultural ecological context and commodified at the national and international level, then the place of these animals in the local culture and ecology becomes irrelevant if they do not contribute to cash generation and profit extraction. As seen repeatedly during the Anthropocene, the severing of the dynamic link (and its constraints) between human populations and the ecology of the places in which they live opens the way for all kinds of distortions, disruptions, and global threats, including the threat of pandemics.",

            "text": "One of the mechanisms through which populations and communities try to regulate access to and extraction of resources is through taboos. The enforcement of taboos may strike a dynamic balance between the biological and ecological characteristics of a species and its rate of extraction and use. This is often achieved through cultural and social mechanisms that may be effective as long as social and cultural integrity is not replaced with and substituted by commodified livelihoods. In this way, uses and traditions may lead to wildlife conservation, as shown in several studies [74, 89]. Culture and tradition regulate the use of certain species; the replacement of cultures and traditions with Western culture and a profit-based economic system breaks those regulations, with dire effects on the targeted species. In a study about taboos among rural communities of Cameroon, Bobo et al. [74] found that local culture regulates wildlife extraction and use through social norms and taboos. Four types of taboos that regulate resource extraction can be distinguished: (1) species specific, which regulate access (e.g., hunting, fishing, gathering) to specific wild species of ecological or cultural relevance (e.g., totem species); (2) habitat, which regulate (e.g., forbid during certain times of the year) access to specific habitats (e.g., sacred forests); (3) method, which regulate the culturally sanctioned time, place, means, and ways through which an activity (e.g., hunting) can be performed; and (4) segment taboos, which impose restrictions on the consumption of certain animals by certain social groups such as women or children [87, 90, 91]. Through taboos and social norms, resource-dependent communities regulate the rate of use of the species they depend upon for their survival, thus fostering resilience and cultural and social continuity.",

Several scholars have argued, in this respect, for the important role of consumer education in food habits and choices to reduce demand for prestige meat [92]. For example, shark fin soup is a preferred dish for ostentatious wedding ceremonies, birthday parties, and business meetings in China, and the demand for shark fins (often obtained through the practice of finning, which involves cutting the shark\u2019s fin and throwing the shark back into the water) is pushing shark populations towards collapse [93, 94]. However, since about 2011, there has been an estimated 50\u201370% decrease in shark fin consumption in China, following many educational campaigns on the issue. In a survey about shark fin consumption conducted by WildAid, about 75% of the respondents did not even know the meat in the soup was from sharks, apparently because the name of the dish in Mandarin is \u201cfish wing soup.\u201d This is encouraging in relation to the importance of education. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese government has shut down wet markets all over the country and has begun a campaign of awareness concerning the importance of protecting wild species for collective health. The banning of wet markets, wildlife trade, and wildlife farming, without driving down the demand for wild meat, risks causing the trade to move underground, with a potentially even worse impact on commercialized species. Rather, demand can be reduced by informing and educating consumers about the consequences of their food desires and habits; there is no prestige in driving species to extinction. At the same time, there is the need to support alternative livelihoods for hunters, traders, and wildlife farmers if and when banning wet markets and wildlife trade. In the absence of alternative means of subsistence, any ban on wildlife trade and consumption will have a disproportionate effect on their livelihoods, pushing many of them into poverty and illegality [95]. Questions on how to alleviate poverty, and what outcomes this would have on bushmeat consumption, are nonetheless open to debate [96].",

The main traits of the Anthropocene, i.e., ecosystem and biodiversity loss, disrupted and turbulent ecologies, pervasive human activity, intensification of land use, commodification of traditional foods and knowledge, indeed also shape the conditions for the emergence of zoonotic diseases. The spread of zoonotic viruses in the last hundred years, more so in connection with attempts at wildlife farming, recalls what previously happened during the domestication process of livestock thousands of years ago. Continued contact between wild animal species and humans is known to be a source of zoonotic diseases. With increasing close contact during and after the domestication process, and with the increasing densities of human communities, zoonotic diseases like measles emerged at that time. The sanctioning of wildlife farming by the Chinese Government has probably improved the livelihoods and economic conditions of wildlife farmers, many of whom have been pushed out of the livestock sector and into wildlife farming at the forest\u2019s hedge during the 1990s by the expansion of intensive livestock husbandry [97], but may have contributed in opening up an old Pandora\u2019s Box. Many of the diseases that have plagued humans over the last several thousand years derived from our close relationships with our domesticated species. In the same way that the historical process of livestock domestication has brought us new diseases, is it possible that contemporary attempts at wildlife farming are leading us down the same path? Indeed, both processes stem from the intensification of human-animal relations (e.g., the reliance, close-proximity and handling by humans of selected species, or their trade) which leads down a path that facilitates the crossing of the species barrier by viruses present in reservoir and intermediate hosts.",
