PRV was discovered at the beginning of the 20th century and is prevalent in at least 44 countries [2]. Pigs are the natural hosts and the main source of transmission, but PRV has a broad host range and can also infect a variety of livestock and wildlife [2,3]. Recently, it has been reported that PRV can infect humans, with weakness, fever, sweating, dysphagia, and neurological dysfunction as typical symptoms [4]. PRV belongs to the Alpherpesvirus subfamily [5,6]. PR has been eradicated in several countries including the USA, New Zealand, and many European countries. However, PRV is still in circulation worldwide.",

In previous reports, we analyzed all known PRV full-length genomes and all available gB, gC, gD, and gE gene sequences. We found that PRV could be divided into clade 1 and 2 based on the gC gene. The current vaccine strain Bartha-K61 clustered with clade 1. However, the most recent PRV variants clustered with clade 2. We previously reported that variant PRV forms and recombination in China could be the source of continued epidemics [9,10]. So far, the most effective method of prevention and control of pseudorabies is vaccination. The emergence of PRV variant strains brought huge economic losses to the pig industry since classical vaccines were not completely effective against it [11,12]. The fact that PRV can persist in the host for a long time after infection makes its prevention and control challenging [13].",

Due to the large specific surface area and unique physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials, some researchers studied the effect of nanomaterials on antiviral activity. In particular, graphene oxide significantly reduced PRV replication at noncytotoxic concentrations [14]. In addition, it has been reported that lithium chloride (LiCl) and diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG) have good inhibitory effect on PRV replication [15]. Of note, although there are some studies on the antiviral effect of LiCl and DG on PRV, relatively few studies on their antiviral effect against newly emerged PRV variant virus were reported. Considering the currently wide prevalence of PRV variant in China, effective antiviral drugs against the variant PRV should be screened as soon as possible.",

In particular, germacrone antitumor effect on the human hepatoma cell line is mediated via G2/M cell cycle arrest and by promoting apoptosis [19]. In terms of antiviral activity, germacrone inhibits influenza virus (IAV), Porcine parvovirus (PPV), Feline calicivirus (FCV), and Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication [16,20,21,22]. Germacrone has inhibitory effects on H1N1, H3N2 influenza viruses, and Influenza B viruses in the early stages of the viral cycle and can protect mice from fatal infection [20]. However, it does not block PRRSV adsorption and invasion and cannot inhibit both classical and highly pathogenic II PRRSV strains [16].",

However, the fluorescent signal decreased after treatment with germacrone in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3E,F). The obtained titer values were used for estimation of the 50% effective concentration (EC50). To obtain detailed insight into the efficacy of germacrone against PRV, we next calculated the EC50 values, which reflect the concentration of germacrone that is required to abolish infectious virus particle production by 50%. Figure 3G shows the EC50 values for germacrone following infection with PRV in Vero or PK-1 cells. The EC50 values were 54.51 and 88.78 \u00b5M germacrone in Vero and PK-1 cells, respectively.

            "text": "Over the past decade, a number of novel viruses emerged in pigs in China and caused huge economic losses [28,29]. As one of them, at the end of 2011, re-emergence PR outbreaks were reported in many pig farms in China. Evidence suggests that the new epidemic is the result of a variant PRV strain [2,30]. The Bartha-K61 vaccine is inadequate to protect pigs from infection with variant PRV [8], and thus antiviral therapeutics may be a critical strategy to control variant PRV damage in the swine husbandry. PRV is an important threat to animals and possibly humans. A case of suspected PRV infection in humans occurred in China in 2017. The patient presented with fever, headaches, and visual impairment [4]. Many countries have also reported PRV interspecies transmission [3]. With the emergence of new viruses that threaten both the pig industry and public health, the discovery of new functions in existing clinical drugs is often used in the screening of modern emergency drugs. Germacrone has an antiviral effect on a variety of viruses, such as IAV, PPV, FCV, and PRRSV [16,20,21,22]. In this study, we investigated the effect of germacrone on PRV variant strain. We found that germacrone could inhibit PRV replication in a dose-dependent manner at the early stage of virus replication by western blot and IFA. We showed that germacrone could not directly kill the virus nor affect the adsorption and invasion of PRV. We also found that it could not affect the expression of nectin-1, nectin-2, and CD155, the receptors of PRV. To further investigate at which phase PRV replication is sensitive to germacrone treatment, cells were exposed to germacrone at various time points. PRV replication was impressed significantly when cells were treated with germacrone at 6 hpi. In addition, we found that the antiviral effect at 12 h was significantly higher than at 6 h, so we concluded that germacrone had the best antiviral effect in the early stage of virus replication, as in the case of PRRSV [16]. We speculate that treatment with germacrone may affect the expression of host genes or cellular factors, some of which may be required for viral replication. Therefore, we speculate that germacrone may inhibit PRV replication by affecting a cell antiviral mechanism.",

Both DG and germarone belong to traditional Chinese medicine. However, unlike DG which directly kills the virus, germarone plays a role at the early stage of PRV replication and can be used as a therapeutic drug. Although the antiviral effect of germacone is worse than that of LiCl, germacone is safer, considering that resistance develops with the use of chemical drugs like LiCl in clinical applications. We also studied the effect of germarone on the vaccine strain Bartha-K61 and found that it inhibits the replication of PRV vaccine strain Barth K61. So germacrone can be used in vaccinated pigs that are not completely protected against variant type PRV.",

Recently, it was found that germacrone has strong antiviral activity, as well as anti-inflammatory and other pharmacological effects potentially useful for clinical applications [31,32]. In particular, the germacrone and oseltamivir combination has a synergistic effect on the inhibition of influenza virus. On the other hand, there are no reports on potential antitumor activity in vivo [33]. The main possible reasons for this phenomenon are: (1) germacrone is mainly extracted and isolated from plants with relatively low yield, therefore the purchase price is high, while the dosage for animal experiments is large; (2) the water solubility of germacrone is relatively poor; and (3) the lack of an antitumor and antivirus mechanism. For all the above reasons, we need to conduct in-depth research on the antiviral mechanism of germacrone, modify the extraction and separation methods to increase the yield, and improve it to make it safer for animal use.",
