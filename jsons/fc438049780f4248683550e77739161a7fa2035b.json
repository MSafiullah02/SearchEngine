            "text": "New Zealand's Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) developed a risk analysis for Hector's and Maui dolphins, in order to inform protection options being considered by the Ministers of Fisheries and Conservation. Unfortunately, MPI's risk analysis combines several estimates that are biased, and the biases consistently act together to underestimate the level of bycatch and overestimate the species' ability to sustain impacts. In essence, the approach uses abundance estimates that are likely biased high, multiplies them by a reproductive rate that has been arbitrarily raised, multiplied by an assumed figure for calf survival, to reach a number of dolphins that would be added each year if the population were to remain stable. From this number, they subtract their estimates of bycatch, which are almost certainly biased low. The remaining number of dolphins is apportioned a cause of death according to autopsy data from 55 Hector's and Maui dolphins found dead on beaches. This is then compared to estimates of what level of takes would be sustainable, calculated using a formula that is not well understood and less conservative than the international standard (PBR, developed by the US National Marine Fisheries Service). This is a poor basis for rational management of an endangered, endemic marine mammal. A key problem with the MPI approach is that its definition of \"risk\" does not relate to the risk of population decline or extinction, and is inconsistent with the modern understanding of the behaviour of meta-populations. The approach defines risk as the likelihood of capture, which is apportioned to different areas according to fishing effort and the habitat model's outputs for dolphin distribution. The protection options are therefore targeted where high densities of dolphins and high fishing effort coincide. Large populations are allocated the highest level of protection, while small populations remain poorly protected. This approach is likely to increase the risk of local extinctions, contractions of dolphin distribution, population fragmentation, loss of genetic variability and result in increased risk to the species as a whole. Many of these points were made by an International Expert Panel in 2018. MPI have failed to provide a list of recommendations from the Expert Panel Report with their responses (if any) to those recommendations. This standard step in scientific practice, following peer review (e.g. response to reviewers' comments) has not been followed.",

While several Maui dolphins have died of toxoplasmosis (Roe et al. 2013) , it is clear that the impact of this disease has been overstated in the TMP (see Section B below). Eliminating cats in the greater Auckland area would bring many general conservation benefits (e.g. for urban bird populations). However, public opposition is likely to render this unachieveable and it is not clear whether eliminating cats would materially benefit Maui dolphin. Focussing on wild cats, as has been suggested by DOC in public meetings, ignores the fact that abandoned domestic cats become wild cats. While a domestic population remains, there will be a ready source of recruits to the wild population. For these reasons, we see the currrent toxoplasmosis action plan as having a low chance of success. Further, it is critical to ensure that efforts to study and manage toxoplasmosis do not distract attention and resources from addressing direct impacts that can be readily managed -in particular fisheries bycatch.",

Important regional populations off southeastern and northeastern coasts of the South Island have been ignored. These populations have had recent gillnet mortalities, and their low abundance renders them especially vulnerable to decline.

This is a well documented hotspot of Hector's dolphin abundance (e.g. Rayment et al. 2010) . This omission results directly from the habitat model that has been used to support the TMP (see Part B below) and the assumption that fishing effort will not be displaced in response to new protection measures. Past experience shows that fishing effort will be displaced to areas where fishing restrictions are less stringent; nearby at first, but ultimately venturing as far as fishers feel they need to. The proposed gap in protection is likely to become a focus of intense fishing activity. Because dolphin abundance there is high, this is likely to increase bycatch, and result in the area becoming a population sink. This would result in shifting, rather than solving the problem.",

When fishers shift, bycatch problems will likely to shift with them. This problem has been recognised for decades (e.g. Dawson 1991 ). The solution is to ensure there is effective protection where the dolphins are, rather than only where gillnet and trawl fisheries are currently operating. This strategy has no cost to fishers if they are not operating in a particular area currently, and protects dolphin populations from shifts in fishing effort, whether caused by regulation, stock depletion, or market pressure.",

Hector's dolphin distribution is more dispersed in winter than in summer, with respect to water depth and distance from land (Rayment et al. 2010; Clement 2014, 2016) . Turbidity was the only environmental variable available to the modelling team that had any seasonal component. Hence it was inevitable that the habitat model would suggest a correlation between dolphin distribution and turbidity. This is not an indication that turbidity drives dolphin distribution, but a demonstration that the modelling process was flawed. A better fit is likely to result from including depth and season (summer, autumn, winter, spring) directly in the model. Depth is directly relevant to Hector's dolphins, because they feed mostly on bottom-dwelling fish (Miller et al. 2013 ).",

If there had been no change in the size of the dolphin population, and no change in the spatial distribution of fishing effort, one would expect an average of about 150 dolphin deaths per year during the 1990s and early 2000s, and about 260 dolphin deaths per year during the early 1980s, based on the higher fishing effort alone.
