Dengue transmission is ubiquitous throughout the tropics, with the highest risk zones in the Americas and Asia. It is estimated that there are 390 million dengue infections annually. [1] The pathogen of dengue fever is the dengue virus (DENV), which is a singlestranded RNA virus that belongs to the Flavivirus genus. DENV is transmitted by Aedes Aegypti. There are four serotypes of DENV (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4). All of these serotypes can cause mild dengue fever and, in some cases, can lead to life-threatening complications such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). [2] DHF and DSS represent the more severe forms of the disease after DENV infection, and they are commonly reported in children. Other symptoms of DENV infection include fever, low platelet count, hemorrhagic bleeding, and vascular permeability. [3] Cur-rently, an effective antiviral therapy or a vaccine for DENV infection is not available. The need to simultaneously immunize and induce long-lasting protection against all four serotypes poses a particular challenge in the development of a vaccine.

Lycorine has also been reported to demonstrate broad-spectrum inhibitory activities against several viruses, such as poliovirus, [11] severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), [12] herpes simplex virus (type 1), [13] vaccinia virus, [14] bunyaviruses, Punta Toro virus, and Rift Valley fever virus. [15] Lycorine has been previously shown to potently inhibit flaviviruses in an in vitro model.

Lycorine primarily exerted its activity through the suppression of viral RNA replication. Mutagenesis studies revealed a single amino acid substitution (Val9Met) in the 2K peptide (which spans the endoplasmic reticulum membrane between the NS4A and NS4B proteins). However, whether the 2K peptide was the direct target of lycorine remains to be determined. Additionally, some synthesized lycorine derivatives have been investigated for their inhibitory activities against WNV.
