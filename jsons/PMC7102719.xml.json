Pandemic flu is one of the most important pathogens that cause outbreaks of disease, and it has a high risk of spreading rapidly because of the airborne nature of its dissemination. To identify the attitudes of healthcare professionals regarding work attendance during such an outbreak, a questionnaire was designed de novo following discussions with colleagues at Imperial College and with reference to the literature on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1], [2], [3], [4]. The choice of pandemic influenza was pragmatic because preparations were underway to prepare for an expected pandemic in the near future. To aid planning for business continuity, an understanding of staff attitudes toward pandemic flu is invaluable. Pandemic flu was compared with SARS, the most recent example of a global infectious disease that spread quickly around the world and affected patients and healthcare staff. Published literature was consulted to determine the lessons that had been learned. The questions for the questionnaire were empirically chosen based on the assumption that generic issues arising from the way the SARS outbreak was managed would be relevant to the management of an influenza pandemic. Subsequently, questions from a Department of Health (DH) questionnaire about pandemic flu that asked respondents about the distance of their residence from the hospital were combined with this questionnaire.",

The risk of extravagant respondents is a possibility in any survey, especially when the survey is anonymous.

Missing values are a major factor in reaching valid conclusions. There are methods for calculating these values that remove the effect of hidden bias in the data.

The first method involves comparing the result with a highly valid measure, such as the work attendance of the participants, to exclude the effect of confounding factors. The second method uses the level of correlation between the dependent and independent variables [9]. The first method was not possible because of the anonymous nature of the study; thus, we applied the second method. To ensure content validity in the second method, the questionnaire should be checked for two issues. The first issue ensures that the independent variables have a minimum level of correlation with the measured dependent variables. This procedure was used to identify irrelevant questions. The second issue involves the identification of highly correlated independent variables. If there is a high degree of correlation between these variables, the questionnaire should be checked again. If possible, it is recommended that these questions be merged, resulting in a shorter questionnaire with the same level of validity.",
