Inductive sites are where the uptake of antigens from the mucosal surface and the priming of na\u00efve T and B lymphocytes occurs. The other sites recruit several effector mechanisms including the production of secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) antibodies (Brandtzaeg et al., 2008). The inductive sites of mucosal immunity include well-defined tissues such as the mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) (Liebler-Tenorio and Pabst, 2006) and the loco-regional lymph nodes. The effector sites encompasses different and not well-delimited compartments, such as the lamina propria of the various mucous membranes that should not be considered part of the MALT (Brandtzaeg et al., 2008). The organization of the immune system in the intestinal mucosa includes non-encapsulated and concentrated lymphoid tissue (Peyer's patches of the ileum and jejunum) (Burkey et al., 2009) constituting the inductive sites that also include part of the epithelium associated with the follicles (Sato and Iwasaki, 2005). A diffuse non-encapsulated compartment, including cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells) located outside Peyer's patches but residing in the lamina propria, represents the effector sites where effector mechanisms of cell-mediated and humoral immunity take place (Tizard, 2013). Plasma cells are located mainly around the intestinal crypts and form the secretory component of the mucosal immune system, devoted to the production of protective humoral factors acting on the mucosal surface.",

Therefore the intestinal mucosal immune system has attracted much research interest in recent years. Mucosal responses are more difficult to assess than systemic responses. Mucosal immunity assays can be run through quantifying cell subpopulations (mononuclear cells, neutrophils) or by analyzing immune-related molecules (cytokines, immunoglobulins). There is no gold standard for evaluating secretory immunity in mucosal surfaces. The humoral mucosal immune system can be examined with the same techniques used for serology. A critical point is the sampling of secretions, which may be affected by serum or blood contamination, or excessive dilution by other contaminants (ingesta or enzymes) (Guy, 2002). Flushing the mucosal surface does not always allow the collection of immunoglobulins contained in the mucosal surface film, if the film is highly viscous. In these cases, scraping the mucosal surface ensures a more suitable sample for analysis compared to simple flushing, but can increase serum leakage.",

            "text": "This study quantified the density and distribution pattern of IgA-, IgG- and IgM-bearing PCs in the intestinal lamina propria of normal swine intestinal tracts. PC distribution in the intestinal mucosa along the villus-crypt axis progressively increases (s.c. vertical gradient) whereas it decreases from duodenum to ileum (s.c. horizontal gradient), and IgA-containing PCs predominate over the other two isotypes. Our results confirm the existence of the different distribution patterns of PCs in the intestine as reported by Allen and Porter, 1973, Allen and Porter, 1977 and support the application of the method to study one aspect of the mucosal immune response. From the literature, it is known that the IgA- and IgM-bearing PCs are more numerous than the IgG-containing PCs in the intestinal mucosa (Stokes and Bailey, 2000). PC distribution is not uniform along the small intestine (Allen and Porter, 1973): in the duodenum lamina propria the PCs are about tenfold more than the amounts found in the jejunum (Allen and Porter, 1973), independently of the immunoglobulin isotype (Allen and Porter, 1973, Allen and Porter, 1977). The distribution is not uniform even along the villus-crypt axis: in suckling piglets both IgA- and IgM-containing PCs are more numerous in the lamina propria around the crypt, than in the villus lamina propria (Allen and Porter, 1973). This feature is consistent with the \u201cphysiology\u201d to concentrate IgA-secreting cells at this level: primed lymphocytes migrate here, as reported by Bimczok and Rothk\u00f6tter (2006), from post-capillary venules of the lamina propria, that are numerous around the crypts. Another possible explanation is related to the distribution of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) in the intestine (Marsilio et al., 2011). From the above, the importance of displaying the exact histological location of immune cells in the mucosa is clear in order to have comparative data from normal to pathologic conditions. Of note from the results of this work is the assessment of the specificity and repeatability of the sandwich immunohistochemical technique to PCV2. The specificity of the sandwich method was proved by the absence of staining when either the viral suspension or the primary anti-PCV2 antibody was omitted. The method was planned on the basis of a technique proposed by Kipar et al. (1998) that disclosed anti-feline coronavirus-specific antibodies in PCs of the granulomata in feline infectious peritonitis, suggesting the use of a viral suspension as a preliminary step followed by a classical IHC stain directed to the virus.",

Other limiting factors of these techniques are contamination with blood or serum leakage that can provide both cells and humoral factors. The most important deficiency of these techniques is that they cannot detect the spatial distribution of immune cells in the tissue in which they are located. Another way to assess mucosal humoral immune response is to test the amounts of antibodies in intestinal lavage/fluids by serological investigations. Taking into account the different affinity of the antibodies to fluid or viscous components of the intestinal secretions (Kim and Ho, 2010), the test sensitivity can be highly influenced by the collection method.",

The presence of the stain in these cell types can be due to wild replicating PCV2, because they represent a target for the virus. However other explanations for the stain linked to the use of the viral suspension can be argued. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are known to be present on the cell surface and in the endosomal vesicles of macrophages (Ackermann, 2012). In particular, swine macrophages bear cytoplasmic TLR-9 with a high affinity for methylated CpG motifs, a DNA pattern highly shared among viruses (Vincent et al., 2007, Fairbairn et al., 2011). Moreover, macrophage cellular proteins, including complement factor C1qB, are known to interact with the PCV2 capsid (Meng, 2013). The affinity for such molecules can explain the positive cytoplasmic reaction of macrophages by the sandwich technique, but the morphological diversity of the labelled cells (plasma cells vs macrophages) is sufficient to avoid confusing macrophages with the count of PCs containing anti-PCV2 Igs. The cytoplasmic immunolabelling of endothelial cells can be due to the crossing of Igs through the endothelium similarly to the apical immunolabelling of crypt cells due to crossing of IgA; a role for TLR cannot be excluded also in endothelial cells (Snoeck et al., 2006).",

Parenteral administration of the vaccine presumably enhanced the mucosal as well as the systemic immune response. This can be considered a \u201cbooster-like\u201d effect of the vaccine and a way to explain the lower frequency of viraemia and reduction of faecal shedding in the vaccinated animals (Sarli et al., 2012).
