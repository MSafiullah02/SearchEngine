            "text": "Microbiological risk assessment (MRA) requires a dose-response relationship to translate the exposure (i.e. number of pathogen particles entering the host through a given route) into the probability of infection. Infection by an oral pathogen is defined as the multiplication of organisms within the host, followed by excretion (Haas et al., 1999) and, for the purpose of the work here does not include progression of disease or the host acquired immune response. Obtaining dose-response data for humans has generally relied on volunteer challenge experiments e.g. Cryptosporidium parvum in students (Okhuysen et al., 1998) or using outbreak data to back-calculate the relationship between measured exposures and infection rates (Teunis et al., 2004). There are limitations to both approaches particularly with emerging pathogens for which the exposure routes may not be fully elucidated, and for pathogens with serious clinical outcomes, e.g. Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV). Furthermore zoonotic viruses emerge through jumping the species barrier from an animal source to humans, e.g. Nipah virus (NiV) and EBOV, and in this respect the dose response would be for a one-off event that may be inefficient and difficult to reproduce without large numbers of animals. An additional complication is that the pathogen may adapt to the new host, such that its infectivity increases. This is well established for filoviruses in laboratory animals where the infectivity per plaque-forming unit (pfu) may change by several orders of magnitude with passaging (Gale et al., 2016), and has recently been demonstrated for EBOV Makona adapting to humans through an amino acid substitution in its glycoprotein during the recent catastrophic outbreak in West Africa (Diehl et al., 2016, Urbanowicz et al., 2016). That outbreak also raised many questions regarding the unknown potential for companion animals (cats and dogs) to serve either as a reservoir or vector for the virus and so be involved in transmission of EBOV to humans and other animals. The absence of dose-response data for EBOV in humans limits development of MRAs for the risk of infection of citizens in the EU for example from EBOV in illegally imported bushmeat. Indeed, it has been proposed that the infectivity to humans of an EBOV pfu may differ not only from bushmeat samples from different wildlife species (e.g. fruits bats and nonhuman primates) but also from different individuals of the same species depending on the degree of host adaptation (Gale et al., 2016). In effect no two pieces of bushmeat from EBOV-infected wildlife may be the same in terms of infectivity to humans, although this remains to be proved. There is clearly a need for novel approaches to calibrate dose-response relationships for the purposes of MRA for emerging pathogens.",

            "text": "The infection process of a host cell can be broken down into the component steps and modelled mathematically (Handel et al., 2014) and the probability of infection can be expressed as a function of the combined probabilities of each step (Gale et al., 2014). These steps include overcoming the initial host defenses, binding of the virion to its host cell receptor, entry to the host cell (i.e. internalisation and uncoating of the virion), and replication, capsid assembly and budding (Gale et al., 2014). Previously it was demonstrated that a dose-response model could, in part, be parameterized using thermodynamic data for some of the key molecular interactions in the infection process (Gale, 2017). The beauty of thermodynamic data is that they can be measured experimentally by biochemists (in some cases just using molecular components e.g. cloned virus protein and host receptor protein (Wang et al., 2016)) and do not involve live animal or human volunteer studies, which is a major advantage for dangerous pathogens. Furthermore the effect of amino acid substitutions in the host receptors on binding affinity can be measured directly (Yuan et al., 2015). The possibility of applying thermodynamics is further developed here for two of the key steps in the infection process of a host by a virus. The first step modelled is the probability of the virus overcoming the innate host defenses posed by mucin protein molecules and the pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) produced by the host. Mucins have sugar units on their surface which bind to components on the surface of the virus, for example the haemagglutinnin (HA) glycoprotein molecules of influenza virus (de Graaf and Fouchier, 2014) or the VP1 of norovirus (NoV) (de Rougemont et al., 2011). Mucus present in the respiratory tract hampers influenza virus infection and in the case of humans predominantly contains  \u03b12,3-sialic acid receptors. Indeed influenza viruses with  \u03b12,3 specificity were inhibited by human mucins (de Graaf and Fouchier, 2014). The PRRs include the mannose binding protein (MBP) which has carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRD) which bind to regularly repeating sugar units on pathogen surface (Taylor and Drickamer, 2006). The second step modelled here is the binding of the virus to its specific receptors on the host cell surface. The approach here is developed for a generic faecal/oral virus such as NoV and rotavirus which infects epithelial cells lining the intestine (Boshuizen et al., 2005, De Rougemont et al., 2011), but could be applied to influenza A viruses which are inhaled and infect cells of the trachea and lung (de Graaf and Fouchier, 2014).",

            "text": "This paper first gives an overview of a mechanistic dose response model to introduce two probability parameters, namely the fraction, Fv, of virus escaping the mucin defense barrier and the fraction, Fc, of host cells with bound virus. The Methods section sets out a difference equation method to model Fv and Fc as a function of the mucin: virus ratio and virus dose in the intestine, respectively. Central to determining Fv and Fc is the strength of binding of the virus to the mucin and host cell as defined by the equilibrium constants Kmucin and Ka respectively. In the Theory section, the application of published data on the binding of the virus surface envelop glycoprotein (GP) to host cell receptor (Cr) molecules or to mucin molecules is reviewed in terms of determining Kmucin and Ka in order to parameterize the dose-response. Particular reference is made to using the dissociation constant Kd which is routinely determined experimentally for virus GPs binding to Cr molecules (Gambaryan et al., 2005, Raman et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2016). It is then shown how the strength of virus/host cell binding (i.e. the magnitude of Ka) may be predicted from changes in two thermodynamic parameters, namely enthalpy (H) and entropy (S). The effects of amino acid changes at the contact surfaces of the virus GP and Cr on the enthalpy are considered with a view to the future parameterization of dose-response models based on genetic sequencing data. Entropy changes are also considered both in terms of virus binding and also in the interpretation of Kd data.",

            "text": "The model parameters and variables are summarised in Table 1\n. On ingestion of the initial virus challenge dose, Vinitial, by the host there are a number of immediate host defences in the mouth and gastrointestinal (GI) tract including the mucus barrier, decoy receptors and the innate immune system that selectively bind and hence remove the virus (McGuckin et al., 2011). For example the histoblood group antigens (HBGAs) are genetically determined glycans to which NoV selectively binds and are present on both decoy receptors in the saliva and on mucin, the main protein component of mucus (Shanker et al., 2011). The total number of viruses surviving the mucin barrier, and getting through to the intestine is given by(1)Vintestine=FV\u00d7Vinitialwhere Fv is the fraction of free virus, i.e. that not bound to mucin. As shown in Fig. 1\n, Fv can be modelled by two parameters, namely the total number, Muctotal, of mucin molecules in the mucus in the saliva and GI tract and an association constant, Kmucin (defined below) that quantifies the strength of binding of the virus to a mucin molecule. Thus by inserting Fv from Fig. 1 for a given mucin concentration into Eq. (1), the total number of free virus particles in the intestine and available to initiate infection of the epithelium may be modelled. On reaching the intestinal epithelium, a free virus particle binds to the surface of a host cell. The probability of infection of the host, phost, equals the probability of successful infection of at least one cell and is related to the number of cells (C.V) with bound virus by:-(2)phost=1\u2212(1\u2212pcell)C.Vwhere pcell is the probability of successful infection of a host cell given a virus has bound to its surface. Thus the more cells with bound virus then the greater the chance that infection will be successful in at least one of them. The probability pcell depends on ability of the bound virus to enter the cell, replicate and bud (Gale et al., 2014, Gale, 2017) and is not discussed further here. Now(3)C.V=FcCtotalwhere Fc is the fraction of cells with bound virus, and Ctotal is the number of cells in the host intestinal epithelium. As shown in Fig. 2\n, Fc is directly proportional to the total number of virus particles in the intestine, Vintestine, and is also dependent on the strength of the binding interaction between the virus and the epithelial cell surface as quantified by the association constant, Ka, which is now defined.",

This is needed to convert particle numbers in moles into concentrations for use in Eq. (5). The volume into which the pathogen enters within the host is for example the lumen of the intestine or even a drop of body fluid (e.g. blood) on a mucosal surface in the case of EBOV. For the purpose of the model, a 100 cm length of host intestine with a radius of 1 cm is simulated. The total surface area is therefore 628.3 cm2 and the volume inside the intestinal lumen is 0.314 dm3 (1 dm3 = 1000 cm3). According to Rosen and Misfeldt (1980) the density of cells in dog kidney epithelia is 6.6 \u00d7 105 cells per cm2. The total number, Ctotal, of epithelial cells over the 628.3 cm2 surface of the model intestine is thus 4.15 \u00d7 108, and the density of cells by volume is 1.32 \u00d7 109 per dm3. Dividing by the Avogadro number, L, of 6.02 \u00d7 1023 particles per mole (Price and Dwek, 1979) gives a mole concentration by volume [Ctotal] of total host cells of 2.19 \u00d7 10\u221215 M. It is reassuring to note that this is similar to the cell concentration of 4.1 \u00d7 10\u221215 M reported for the canine kidney cells in the avian influenza virus binding experiments of Nunes-Correia et al. (1999). Handel et al. (2014) in their simulation for influenza virus infection use a concentration which is \u223c100-fold higher although they simply assumed a packed collection of cells each with a volume of 20 \u00b5m3. The model here therefore takes into account the large void volume of the intestine within which a faecal-oral pathogen is diluted.",

In contrast ingestion of a 0.314 dm3 volume of water contaminated with pathogen could give a homogeneous (Poisson) distribution along the 1 m length. This is not considered further here.

This is relative to the virus concentration in the intestine which is fixed at 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221215 M. Thus 4.15 \u00d7 108 virus particles in a volume of 0.314 dm3 on dividing by L represent a concentration of 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221215 M. The dashed lines in Fig. 1 show Fv as calculated by Eq. (11) for each Kmucin value using [Muctotal] as an approximation for [Mucfree]. This is an appropriate approximation at high mucin to virus ratios. However, at mucin: virus ratios of < 1:1, [Mucfree] becomes much less than [Muctotal] as all the mucin is bound, particularly at high Kmucin values, and Eq. (11) is not applicable. As an example, the arrow in Fig. 1 shows that Eq. (11) predicts that 4.4% of virus is free (i.e. 95.6% of virus is bound) when there is 10,000-fold more virus particles than mucin molecules. This is clearly not possible. At lower Kmucin values, Fv decreases linearly with increasing mucin: virus ratio and may be modelled by Eq. (11) in good agreement with Fv calculated by the difference equation approach (symbols in Fig. 1). Thus Eq. (11) holds at low Kmucin values or at high mucin: virus ratios (irrespective of Kmucin). This is important because high mucin: virus ratios might be expected in a natural infection situation even with the high virus challenge dose used in the simulation here. From the practical point of developing MRA methodology, applying Eq. (11) is easier than the complicated difference equation approach developed for the symbols in Fig. 1. Thus understanding the limitations of Eq. (11) is important. In summary Eq. (11) fails at mucin: virus ratios of < 1:1 at the higher Kmucin values, as represented by the arrow, but is generally applicable at lower Kmucin values particularly at higher mucin: virus ratios. The results show that the value of Kmucin is critical not only in determining whether Eq. (11) can be used in MRA but also in assessing how effective the mucin barrier is in mopping up viruses.",

To investigate the effect of stochasticity, the mechanistic model developed in Table 2 is used to determine the infectious dose 50% (ID50), i.e. the value of Vinitial for which phost = 0.5. It was found that for the high affinity virus (Ka = 1013 M\u22121), the ID50 is 1574 viruses and for the low affinity virus (Ka = 1010 M\u22121) the ID50 is 1574,000 viruses (Table 4\n). The C.V value for the ID50 is 6.6 and, being much greater than 1, is in the range where stochasticity is less of an issue.

By rearranging Eq. (16) and setting Vinitial = ID50 and phost = 0.5, p1 is calculated as 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 for the high affinity and low affinity viruses respectively. These values may be used directly in the conventional dose-response model in the form of Eq. (16). Furthermore, setting Vinitial = 1 in the mechanistic model in Table 4 predicts the same probability values of 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 4.4 \u00d7 10\u22127 for the high affinity and low affinity viruses respectively suggesting that stochasticity is not a problem as expected for dose-response models which are linear at low doses.",

However, the reciprocal Kd values measured by SPR for the GP/Cr interaction cannot directly be used as the Ka values in Figs. 2 and 3. This is because Kd as measured by SPR does not take into account the number of GP/Cr contacts per virus/cell interaction and also does not allow for any changes in the entropy (S) on the binding and immobilization of a whole virus particle to a cell (discussed below). For example, Beniac et al. (2012) calculated that an EBOV virion filament of 982 nm in length would have about 1888 copies of the GP spike protein and could therefore make multiple contacts with Cr molecules on the host cell surface. The change in Gibbs free energy (\u0394Gd) for dissociation of one mole of GP/Cr contacts is related to Kd (Price and Dwek, 1979, Kastrits and Bonvin, 2013) by:-\u0394Gd=\u2212RTlnKdwhere T is the temperature and R is the ideal gas constant (8.31 J/mol/K (Price and Dwek 1979)). Since the Gibbs free energy (G) is a state function in thermodynamics, the overall change in G for dissociation of n moles of GP/Cr contacts, is given byn\u0394Gd=\u2212nRTlnKd=\u2212RTlnKdn\n",

Therefore in principle knowing \u0394Ha and \u0394Sa would enable calculation of Ka and hence Fc for a given dose of virus from Fig. 2. Bostrom et al. (2011) demonstrated how the binding affinity of an antibody could be broken down into the enthalpy and entropy terms. How this approach could be applied to a virus during infection with the aim of calibrating dose-response models is summarized as Approach 3 in Table 3. To the author's knowledge there are no data for \u0394Ha and \u0394Sa for viruses binding to host cells. However, Carneiro et al. (2002) measured the forces between vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and an artificial phospholipid (PL) bilayer (as opposed to a host cell) and obtained values for \u0394Ha and \u0394Sa of \u22124958 kJ/mol and = \u221216,062 J/mol/K respectively. Carneiro et al. (2002) explain the huge value for \u0394Ha as the result of the cumulative \u0394Has from multiple interactions due to the dense packing of G protein on the VSV virus surface. Indeed Carneiro et al. (2002) estimate seven G proteins\u2019 binding per VSV and calculate the \u0394Ha and \u0394Sa values for binding of a single G protein at \u2212694 kJ/mol and \u22122196 J/mol/K respectively.",

Viral proteins are rich in intrinsic disorder (Dolan et al., 2015) and intrinsically disordered proteins serve as host cell receptors for viruses. An example is the ephrin receptor ligand binding domain (Fong et al., 2009) which also serves as receptor for Hendra virus (HeV) and NiV (Xu et al., 2012). Thus the unbound ephrin receptor contains partially disordered loops. In the complex (bound to ephrin) these loops are ordered to form the ligand-binding channel (Fong et al., 2009). This raises the question of whether the ephrin receptor undergoes a disorder-to-order transition on HeV/NiV binding. Interestingly Xu et al. (2012) show from the X-ray crystal structure that the binding of HeV G protein involves the movement of a tryptophan \u201clatch\u201d on the ephrin-B2 receptor. There would be a change in the conformational entropy \u0394Sconf associated with this during formation of the HeV G protein/ephrin-B2 receptor complex.",

Counterintuitively, in the case of EBOV GP pseudoviruses, increasing the surface density of GP actually decreases the infectivity by about 10-fold, perhaps reflecting steric hindrance from tightly packed GP proteins (Mohan et al., 2015) blocking a conformational change that gives an increase in \u0394Sconf required for binding of GP to TIM-1 (Gale, 2017). This is consistent with the observation that EBOV GPs are well separated in space on the EBOV filament surface (Beniac et al., 2012) thus allowing plenty of space for conformational changes without steric hindrance. A demonstration of how changes in \u0394Sconf could explain the 10-fold increase in infectivity reported by Mohan et al. (2015) on decreasing the GP density may be explored with Eq. (19). Thus increasing \u0394Sa by 20 J/mol/K (irrespective of the values of \u0394Ha and T) increases Ka by 11-fold. A decrease in conformational entropy (\u0394Sconf) due to steric hindrance of 20 J/mol/K represents the ordering of just four amino acid residues on the basis of the \u22126.1 J/mol/K per residue proposed by Rajasekaran et al. (2016) for disordered proteins. Therefore blocking the disordering of just four amino acids in the EBOV GP could explain the 10-fold decrease in infectivity of EBOV GP pseudoviruses with high GP densities.",

Consideration of \u0394Srt may be of particular importance for binding of filoviruses (Gale, 2017) which comprise repeating modular units linked together into single very long filaments (Beniac et al., 2012, Booth et al., 2013). Thus Gale (2017) argued that the prior immobilisation of multiple virus units through linking together into a polyploid filament enhanced cell binding compared to that of single virus units in the case of filoviruses through a less unfavourable \u0394Srt term.

Thus, EBOV Makona in the 2013 West Africa outbreak adapted to humans (and in doing so became less infectious to bats) through substituting alanine (A) with valine (V) at residue 82 of the GP (Diehl et al., 2016, Urbanowicz et al., 2016). This is referred to as the A82V substitution. However, the changes in infectivity to humans (as measured by EBOV GP pseudoviruses infecting human cell lines) appear to be relatively small and in the range of 2-fold to 4-fold. A 4-fold increase in infectivity due to a 4-fold increase in Fc in Fig. 3 would reflect a 4-fold increase in Ka, and a change in \u0394Ga according to Eq. (18) of \u22123.6 kJ/mol. This would probably reflect changes in \u0394Ha (and not the T.\u0394Sa term) since residue 82 on the EBOV GP is between residues 80 and 83 which make multiple atom contacts directly with six surface residues on the NPC1 protein (Wang et al., 2016). Thus, the A82V substitution in the GP may change \u0394Ha by \u223c\u22123.6 kJ/mol on the basis of measured changes in infectivity. This relatively small change (compared to the \u221211 to \u221221 kJ/mol for a salt bridge) is consistent with the chemical similarity of alanine and valine.",

Indeed, replacing Phe at residue 502 of E. helvum NPC1 with Asp completely restored its binding to EBOV GP (Ng et al., 2015). From the X-ray structure, the presence of Phe at residue 502 of the NPC1 in E. helvum would cause severe clashes on binding EBOV GP (Zhao et al., 2016) such that \u0394Ha in the E. helvum NPC1/EBOV GP complex would be significantly less negative than that for binding to human NPC1 and perhaps even positive (reflecting a repulsion). Indeed, determining \u0394\u0394Ha would enable the effect of the Asp to Phe substitution at residue 502 on Ka and hence on the infectivity of EBOV to E. helvum to be assessed through Eq.

However, at high levels of (i.e. undiluted) virus, EBOV-GP VSV pseudovirus did show significantly increased infection compared to the negative controls. Thus EBOV GP is capable of mediating entry into E. helvum cells, albeit with low efficiency. This is entirely consistent with the dose-response model simulated in Fig. 2 which predicts for low Kas (105\u2013107 M\u22121) that very small fractions (10\u22127 to 10\u22125) of the host cells have bound virus at very high virus doses, i.e. 1011 to 1012. Thus some infection would be expected in E. helvum on the basis of Eqs. (2) and (3) and the probability of infection which, although low at low Ka values, would never be zero because there is no threshold Ka below which binding does not occur (Fig. 3).

Second it decreases the concentration of mucin thus decreasing the mucin: virus ratio. From Fig. 1 both these act synergistically to increase the fraction of free virus.",

The balance between activities of HA and neuraminidase proteins has a critical role in optimal viral fitness, tropism and transmission (Guo et al., 2017). The opposing effects of HA and neuraminidase in influenza A virus infectivity could be modelled through their effect on Kmucin (through kon and koff in Eq. (6)) and the mucin: virus ratio in Fig. 1. Handel et al. (2014) use differential equations to model how sticky an influenza virus should be to maximize fitness, with stickiness representing the balance between attachment and detachment. Shanker et al. (2011) proposed that local flexibility in part of the NoV surface protein could allow the virus to disassociate from salivary mucin-linked HBGA in the changing microenvironment (pH for example) during its passage through the GI tract to subsequently associate with HBGAs linked to intestinal epithelial cells. In effect the koff rates increase in Eq. (6) such that Kmucin varies in different parts of the host.",

In the model developed here a host intestine is simulated with 4.15 \u00d7 108 cells in a volume of 0.314 dm3. The initial infection process is broken down into two stages, namely escape of the virus from the innate host defense barriers (Fig. 1) and the subsequent binding of any remaining virus to its specific receptor on the host cell (Fig. 2). The two parameters, namely Fv and Fc, which quantify these stages represent probabilities which together with pcell can be used with Eqs. (1)\u2013(3) to give a complete dose-response model which calculates the risk of infection of the host from a given challenge dose (Vinitial). (Although Vintestine from Eq. (1) does not appear in Eqs. (2) or (3), it is used in Fig. 2 to estimate Fc for Eq. (3)). The difference equation approach developed here is tedious to apply to MRA and applying Eq. (7) and Eq. (11) would greatly simplify the calculation of Fc and Fv, respectively for MRA purposes. However, using Eq. (7) for Fc fails at low doses of a virus which has a high binding affinity for the host cells (Ka > 1015 M\u22121) and the difference equation approach has to be used as in Fig. 2. Using Eq. (11) for Fv is appropriate for MRA if the mucin concentration exceeds the virus concentration in the host by a factor of > 10 or if Kmucin < 1013 M\u22121 (Fig. 1).",

The work here appears to demonstrate that stochasticity in the mechanistic model is not an issue. If stochasticity issues were to arise for low doses of very high affinity pathogens (i.e. those with very high Ka), the approach should be to use the difference equation approach to determine the ID50 from which p1 can then be calculated and used directly in Eq. 16.

Approach 3 (Table 3) which uses Eq. (19) to calculate Ka is limited by the current lack of data for \u0394Ha and \u0394Sa for the virus/host cell interaction and Approach 2 using published Kd data should therefore be pursued in the absence of experimental Ka data from Approach 1. While data are available for Kd for GP/Cr binding for several viruses, Approach 2 using Eq. (17) to estimate Ka is also limited by lack of information on \u0394Sa for binding of the whole virus to cells. This is important because the magnitude of \u0394Sa for immobilization of a whole virus is likely to be huge as demonstrated for VSV binding to artificial PL bilayers (Table 3). Lack of information on \u0394Sa is therefore a major data gap, and furthermore may also have wider implications in affecting our ability to interpret measured Kd values in terms of the actual infectivity of the virus. Thus it is the Ka as determined by Eq. (17) taking into account \u0394Sa for whole virus binding which defines infectivity (see results from Table 2) and not the Kd alone. This is because \u0394Sa for binding of the whole virus to cells will be much greater than the \u0394Sa for binding of a soluble protein fragment as in Kd determinations by SPR. Indeed the \u0394Sa for binding of VSV is a huge \u221216,062 J/mol/K compared to the \u0394Srt and \u0394Sconf terms for binding of an antibody to its antigen (Table 3) which is comparable to GP binding to its Cr in terms of molecular sizes.",

However, the cell membrane of the host cell typically contains many copies of Cr and in theory each host cell could therefore bind multiple copies of the virus. Furthermore, the virus particles themselves could be ingested as a clump. Indeed in the case of EBOV, many genome copies may be linked together into long polyploid filaments (Beniac et al., 2012) which could affect the thermodynamics of binding (Gale 2017). Eq. (4) could be modified to accommodate multiple viruses binding to a single host cell (as described for ligands binding to a protein by Price and Dwek (1979)) if the number of Crs per host cell is known. It should be stressed that homogeneity in both the mucin and pathogen is assumed here for simplicity. In further developing this mechanistic model, data would be needed not only on the heterogeneity of the mucin concentration but also on the statistical distribution for the number of viruses bound per cell. For example the distribution could be Poisson such that for a ratio of 1 virus bound per host cell (representing a high Vintestine), some host cells have zero, most have one while a few have two, three or even four viruses bound. Alternatively the distribution could be over-dispersed, such that a few host cells have thousands of bound virus while most have none. Clearly, over-dispersion would decrease C.V compared to the Poisson distribution. In the model presented here for demonstrating proof of principle, the modelling of Fc as function of Vintestine assumes each host cell binds just one virus through Eq. (4). This is appropriate for two reasons. First, exposure to faecal/oral pathogens through routes such as water may involve very low numbers of pathogen per person (see Gale 2017), such that it would be unlikely that more than one pathogen would bind to the same host cell. Second, it maximises C.V and hence phost. Thus, the binding of more than one virus to a host cell may be waste of virus resource because C.V in Eq. 2 is not maximised. Binding of two viruses to the same cell will not affect pcell, unless there is co-operation between the two viruses in some way, such that one facilitates infection by the other. In this sense, the value of phost predicted through the mechanistic dose-response here is worst case. It should be noted that Gale (2017) proposed that formation of polyploid filaments in the case of EBOV did indeed enhance cell binding by optimising \u0394Sa, in effect representing a co-operation between viral particles in the infection process. This demonstrates the importance of not only considering the statistical distribution aspects of virus clumps but also the thermodynamic implications on their binding.",

(2012) found that the stability of the HeV-G/ephrin-B2 association does not strongly correlate with the efficiency of viral entry, suggesting that, for ephrin-B2-expressing cells, viral attachment is not the rate limiting step in the viral entry process. This is consistent with highly efficient binding (i.e. large Ka) such that further increasing Ka does not increase the fraction of cells with bound virus, Fc, according to Fig. 3. Hence C.V (through Eq. (3)) is constant and not rate-limiting, while a subsequent part of the infection process accommodated in pcell is less efficient than Fc, such that pcell is very small and controls the overall value of phost according to Eq. (2). Indeed, the magnitude of Ka is much more important when receptor binding is inefficient such as in the jumping of the species barrier into a novel host by an emerging virus as suggested by Gale (2017). This is confirmed by Fig. 3 with Fc increasing linearly with Ka at lower Ka values. Gale (2017) demonstrated that virus binding to its receptor is only important in controlling the probability of infection of a host cell if it is a major barrier, i.e. relatively inefficient. The Ka for a virus jumping the species barrier into a novel host species would be expected to be very low perhaps due to electrostatic repulsion as for Scenarios A and B in Table 5. The subsequent adaptation of the virus to its new host through mutation would increase Ka as suggested here in Table 5 and reported for EBOV in humans (Diehl et al., 2016, Urbanowicz et al., 2016).",

The infectivity of the new virus/host combination relative to the \u201cstandard\u201d virus/host would be directly proportional to the change in Ka (as demonstrated from results in Table 2). Thus, thermodynamics provides the link between changes in the virus/host identified through sequencing data and the risk of infection. This in theory allows predictions of the infectivity of emerging virus strains or the susceptibility of novel hosts to be assessed on the basis of the effects of changes in sequence data. It is concluded that thermodynamic approaches have a major contribution to make in developing dose-response models for emerging viruses.",
