Shopping via TV provided consumers the opportunity to experience convenience through reduced shopping costs vis-\u00e0-vis physical efforts. Unlike Internet shopping, which normally requires consumers\u2019 necessary skills in information technology, TV shopping is a relatively easier way of shopping and therefore can attract more consumers. In addition, the role of host/hostess is a distinct feature of TV shopping versus Internet shopping. Due to the host's/hostess's conversational style, face-to-face gestures, and direct address, TV shopping facilitates interpersonal relationships between the host/hostess and viewers, which furthermore motivates TV shoppers to watch or to eventually buy (Fritchie & Kim, 2003; Kim & Lennon, 2000).",

The market growth increased stably since then. However, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Asia in 2003 accelerated the development of various types of home shopping, including Internet shopping, catalogue shopping, and TV-shopping business. TV shopping enables consumer to get product information from the TV-shopping program and order products by phone without exposing to the SARS outdoor. In addition to traditional ways of product introduction and product demonstration, TV-shopping channels use live programs to promote commodities and stimulate consumer's purchase intentions. In line with technology advancement, TV-shopping industry has been developing vigorously in Taiwan. For example, the revenue of the leading TV-shopping company, ET Mall, in Taiwan has reached 240 billion NT$ (around $7.52 billion) in 2006 form 5 billion NT$ (around $0.16 billion) when established in 1999.1\nFurthermore, the number of major TV-shopping companies increased to three in 2006, and the revenue of the whole industry is expected to be over 500 billion NT$ (around $15.63 billion) in 2007.2\nUnder the circumstance of more than 85% of cable-TV penetration rate in Taiwan,3\nan on-going tremendous growth of TV-shopping industry is envisioned.",

The travel product market was at the third place of total TV-shopping market and its market share accounted for 12.7% in Taiwan in 2006.4\nThe continuingly growing market share of travel products addresses its significance and importance in order to better understand consumers\u2019 behaviors on TV travel product shopping.",

Customer loyalty is also a key component for a company's long-term viability and has been advocated as an easier and more reliable source of superior performance (Krishnamurthi & Raj, 1991). Past studies have endeavored to uncover the prominent antecedents of customer loyalty. Perceived value, satisfaction, and service quality have all been shown to be good predictors of customer loyalty (Petrick, 2004). According to Yang and Peterson (2004), only a moderate number of empirical studies have been conducted to examine the relationships among customer loyalty, satisfaction, and perceived value. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, no empirical study to date has investigated these constructs in a TV-shopping context. This study aims to reduce this gap in the literature.",

Customer loyalty can be defined and assessed by both attitudinal and behavioral measures. The attitudinal measure of customer loyalty refers to a specific desire to continue a relationship with a service provider while the behavioral perspective refers to the concept of repeat patronage. According to Oliver (1999), customer loyalty can be identified in four stages: cognitive loyalty, affective loyalty, conative loyalty, and action loyalty. In practice, it is difficult to observe and measure action loyalty. Most researchers employ conative perspective\u2014that is behavioral intentions, to measure the compromise of loyalty (Yang & Peterson, 2004).",

Value may be viewed as a consumer's overall assessment of product utility based on perceptions of what is received (benefits) compared to what is given (costs) in a service encounter (Zeithaml, 1988). According to equity theory, a customer evaluates what is fair, right, or deserved for the perceived cost of the offering, including monetary payments and non-monetary sacrifices such as time consumption, energy consumption, and stress experienced by customers (Bolton & Lemon, 1999; Yang & Peterson, 2004). It is evident that a customer's perception of receiving value for money positively relates to the satisfaction of the customer. However, there is uncertainty regarding the nature of the relationship between value and satisfaction and the implications of this relationship to future intentions.",

Involvement is in general conceptualized as enduring in nature, and it is argued that characteristics of the environment and temporary situational changes encountered by a consumer do not directly lead to changes in or affect involvement levels. There are different types of involvement in the consumer behavior literature. For example, Houston and Rothschild (1978) classify involvement into product situational involvement, enduring involvement, and response involvement, while Zaichkowsky (1985) distinguishes involvement as product involvement, advertising involvement, and purchase involvement. In this study, we are concerned about the concept of product involvement. According to Zaichkowsky (1985), product involvement is a person's relevance of the object for product category based on inherent needs, values, and interests. The product involvement would take place when the product is perceived as a reflection of consumer's self-image and a high-cost and high-decisional risk (Petty & Cacioppo, 1981). Hence, involvement relates to the consumer's perception of importance and relevance of purchasing behavior. A customer's product involvement has been found to affect the entire nature of the decision process of that customer's purchasing behavior and customers are likely to display attitudinal loyalty for high-involvement purchases (Knox & Walker, 2003). Hence, in this study the level of consumer's product involvement is hypothesized as a moderating role to examine the influence of product involvement on the relationships of perceived value\u2192loyalty and satisfaction\u2192loyalty. The last two hypotheses of the study are thus carried forth:H4The higher the level of involvement, the larger is the likelihood that perceived value will lead to greater customer loyalty.\nH5The higher the level of involvement, the less is the likelihood that satisfaction will lead to greater customer loyalty.\n",

Note that the satisfaction items in this study include evaluations pertaining to both TV-shopping channel and hotel service. Form the perspective of consumer, the consumption of a travel product is a mixed experience involving various elements, for example, travel agent and hotel, as a whole. It is worth further exploring what is the source of effect of satisfaction on loyalty, i.e. TV-shopping service or hotel service. Especially, the perceived risk associated with TV-shopping and Internet-shopping behaviors is always found to be more or less evident. Hence, we turn to examine the moderating effect of consumer's involvement level on the hypothesized relationships, i.e. H4, H5.",

The effect of perceived value on satisfaction is supported. Surprisingly, however, the findings appear to show that only the effect of perceived value on loyalty is supported, while the effect of satisfaction on loyalty is not supported. As aforementioned, the evaluations of satisfaction cover both aspects of TV-shopping service and hotel service due to the nature of travel product in this study. It is to some extent ambiguous to identify which source, TV-shopping channel or hotel, really leads to the insignificance of the relationship of satisfaction\u2192loyalty. The results also imply that TV-shopping customer loyalty can be generated by enhancing a customer's perception of product/service value. Although offering higher product/service value can lead to higher customer satisfaction, furthermore, the mediation effect of satisfaction on the value\u2013loyalty relationship, which is frequently evident in other studies, does not exist in our study's setting. To explore the relationship model in more detail, the whole sample is divided into high- and low-involvement groups and the models are re-estimated. The effect of satisfaction on loyalty turns out to be significant for the low-involvement group, while it remains unsupported for the high-involvement group. Therefore, the moderation effect of involvement only exists in the satisfaction\u2013loyalty relationship. Additionally, the moderation effect of involvement on the value\u2013loyalty relationship also exists. In other words, the higher the level of involvement, the larger is the likelihood that perceived value will lead to greater customer loyalty.",

            "text": "The findings provide some interesting insights into travel product customer behaviors through TV-shopping channels. First, due to characteristics such as intangibility of travel product, the provision of a certain amount of product information is required to reduce a customer's perceived risk. Customer satisfaction is by large related to the associated purchase experience itself and does not necessarily lead to customer loyalty to the TV-shopping channel. However, customer loyalty can be created if the TV-shopping channel provides a value product/service perceived by customers. Hence, value creation appears to be an effective strategy to retain customers. To achieve this goal, the TV-shopping channel can, for example, provide accurate and clear product comparison information among competitors in the TV program or select those travel product providers with good reputation in marketplace as alliance. Second, the effect of perceived value on loyalty is moderated by the level of product involvement. More specifically, the greater the involvement is, the greater the influence of perceived value on loyalty is. Considering customer's product involvement is of importance for TV-shopping marketing strategies. Third, for the low-involvement customers, the satisfaction mediation model\u2014that is, value\u2013satisfaction\u2013loyalty\u2014is evident. This might be due to the requirement that the information amount is in general higher for customers with high involvement than for those with low involvement. Satisfaction is largely assessed by the performance of the purchased product/service itself. Hence, for the low-involvement customers, satisfaction might lead to loyalty. Nonetheless, for the high-involvement customers, who require more information about product/service, satisfaction does not contribute to loyalty. To retain the high-involvement customers, TV-shopping marketers should make efforts to make customers perceive the value on the product/service purchased via TV shopping rather than just satisfy them. By definition, the perceived value is the consumer's overall assessment of the utility of a product/service based on perceptions of what is received and what is given, or a trade-off between perceived benefits and perceived costs (Zeithaml, 1988). Some actions such as product comparison information, product endorsement by experts or celebrities, and service recovery policy can be used to increase benefits and reduce costs perceived by customers. Furthermore, strategies such as building an integrated home-shopping channel, which consists of TV shopping, Internet shopping, and catalogue shopping, and expanding from existing visual TV-shopping channel to introducing physical stores can be implemented to attract more customers and increase their perceived value.",

Additionally, several limitations of the study are noted. Nonprobability sample with self-report data used by the study is a limitation. Probability sampling in association with demographic information is suggested for further investigation. The issue of impulse purchasing behavior made by other studies on TV-shopping behaviors is also suggested to be adopted as another moderator to examine its influences on the model in future research.",
