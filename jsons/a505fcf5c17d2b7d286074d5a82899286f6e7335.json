As only two studies provide information about the monetary cost of fellowship interviews, additional reviews were performed of articles focusing on residency interview costs. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Although limited by their retrospective nature and usual survey response rate biases, the aggregated information demonstrates the expensive nature of fellowship interviews. An interviewee would have spent approximately $6,000 for live interviews applying for surgical fellowships in 2020, adjusting for inflation. Over fifteen hundred residents from surgical specialties applied for fellowships in 2019. If there are a comparable number of fellowship applicants in 2020, the cumulative saved cost of not having live interviews would be $9 million ($6,000 x 1,500 applicants), though that total needs some correction as there are fellowship applicants who interviewed in person before the implementation of social distancing measures.",

The cumulative financial savings for institutions presuming they held interviews after the start of social distancing is over $5 million ($8,400 x 600 programs) and more when accounting for non-General Surgery subspecialty fellowship programs. found that in addition to technical difficulties, applicants expressed concerns about the limited number of faculty interviewers and inability to view the hospital; they also missed observing how surgical faculty and trainees interact. 26 Healy et al. reported that while in the minority, 15% of candidates who participated in videoconference interviews for adult reconstruction fellowship at Newton-Wellesley Hospital's Kaplan Joint Center between 2015 and 2017 did not feel they presented themselves to their satisfaction, 19% were not comfortable ranking the program, and 34% stated that videoconference interviews had an unfavorable impact on their ranking of the program. 24 These studies demonstrate that despite the reduction in financial spending, there are less quantifiable costs to applicants' abilities to convey themselves and assess a program with virtual recruitment.",

            "text": ", some of the most critical months in dictating a senior surgical resident's career are taking place with fellowship applications, interviews and match. The interview seasons of surgical fellowships have been significantly affected by the coronavirus pandemic (Figure 1). Six out of eight currently active National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) subspecialty fellowship matches are from surgical fields. 3 Likewise, eight of fifteen impacted fellowship matches in the San Francisco Matching Program (SF Match) are from surgical subspecialties. 4 Non-NRMP and non-SF Match fellowships (including the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons' Comprehensive Clinical Fellowship in Endocrine Surgery, the American Urological Association's subspecialty fellowships, the Fellowship Council's programs, and the Society of Surgical Oncology sponsored Breast Surgical Oncology Fellowship) are similarly in the course of reviewing applications, interviewing and ranking prospective candidates. 5-8 Fellowship interviews have universally moved to videoconferencing or teleconferencing in this time of social distancing. This change from live to virtual interviews impacts the costs of interviewing for applicants and training programs and is worth reviewing further.",

            "text": ", there is a decrease in the amount of time applicants are away from their residencies with virtual interviews. Oladeji et al. found that Orthopedic Surgery residents missed an average of eleven days for fellowship interviews, and program directors generally perceived this to cause a high level of disruption.17 A separate study byWatson et al.  reported fellowship interviews to be extremely disruptive to General Surgery residency programs, with 57% of residents missing at least a week and 61% needing to use vacation time.18 While virtual fellowship interviews still require applicants to ask for protected hours from their training programs, days are no longer lost to travel and there is an overall net recuperation of resident educational and clinical productivity.Potential Costs of Virtual InterviewsHowever, there is a significant upfront investment of effort by each fellowship program new to virtual recruitment. In contrast to time saved for interview applicants, there may not be savings in faculty and staff time. In fact, the program may expend more time troubleshooting connectivity problems with technical support staff and training faculty in the use of virtual platforms.24 Previous interview applicants have additionally highlighted some concerns about virtual interviews, which have been sporadically implemented in various specialties before COVID-19. 20,24-26 In a study by Pasadhika et al., applicants to the University of Arizona in the 2011Ophthalmology match were given a choice of video or live interviews.20 Interviewees responded favorably to video interviews but thought an on-site departmental tour should be mandatory for a comprehensive impression of the program. The cost reduction of video interviews was obviated when applicants completed a \"second look\" live visit. Residency applicants to the University of New Mexico in the 2011 Urology match were randomized to web based interviews or traditional live interviews; all virtual interviewees were later re-interviewed in person. Applicants in this study by Shah et al. felt less rapport with faculty and perceived virtual interviewing to be a less effective method to properly represent themselves.25 Applicants and faculty favored web based interviews as an adjunct rather than a replacement of live interviews. Pediatric surgery applicants to Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital in Saint Petersburg, Florida in the 2017 interview season participated in video interviews prior to on-site interviews.
