A time during which city governments have, to different degrees, restricted access to urban open spaces and during which officials have also acknowledged that human beings need to leave their isolated apartments and to access open space for exercise and interaction with other human and non-human beings. That the use of open space is essential for health and social reasons, was already the realization of urban planners at the end of the nineteenth century when for example the New Parks movement (Mullaly 1882) in New York led to the introduction of Central Park, a 843 acres large area carved out of the street grid in the center of Manhattan island.",
