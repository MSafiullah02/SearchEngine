            "text": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are found in a majority of living organisms and are involved in a primary defense mechanism against bacteria, fungi, and other potentially hazardous pathogens. AMPs can be found in secretion, invertebrate venoms or in the intracellular space. One example of secreted peptide is bombesin, which is secreted on the skin of the European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) [1]. Another peptide secreted by a toad is maximin H5 (Bombina maxima) [2]. There is a plenty of other antimicrobial peptides produced by various frog species [3]. Other peptides such as cathelicidins are found among the most of the mammals where they are located in lysosomes of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes playing a critical role in the innate immune defense. Other peptides are substantial components of insect toxins such as melittin, present in a honey bee (Apis mellifera) venom [4], mucroporin from scorpion (Lychas mucronatus) venom [5] and/or lycotoxin from the wolf spider (Lycosa carolinensis) venom [6].",

            "text": "Shared mechanism of a function of the AMPs is a formation of pores in the cell membrane leading to the loss of membrane potential, ion imbalance, and cell death. Due to membranolytic properties, that are not restricted to bacteria only but are as effective in eukaryotic cells, some of the peptides have been tested as the potential anticancer compounds. Many of them have been shown to have strong anticancer effects either alone or conjugated to a tumor targeting tag [4], [7], [8], [9], [10]. The ability to specifically interact with cells membranes causing a loss of membrane integrity led to an investigation of virolytic or virus inhibitory properties of AMPs. Li et al. have shown that mucroporin-M1 is active against several enveloped viruses such as measles, SARS-CoV and influenza H5N1 viruses [11]. Hecate, a mellitin analog, was shown to inhibit herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) induced cell fusion and virus spread [12]. The antiviral effect does not necessarily need to be linked to the membrane lysis as it has been shown for melittin and cecropin [13]. Both peptides suppress viral gene expression in micromolar concentrations that are well below toxic concentrations for cells suggesting a mechanism unrelated to membranolytic properties of the peptides. These results prompted a search for the new peptides with an improved antiviral and antibacterial activity, cytotoxicity, lower hemolytic activity, etc. Several approaches can be used toward these goals. Rational redesigning of existing peptides can greatly improve their desired properties. In silico computation led to the construction of hecate, a derivative of melittin, which was designed to alter the surface charge distribution without affecting its amphipathic \u03b1-helical character [12].",

The hybrid peptide was further modified to increase its proteolytic stability and enhance antimicrobial potency [18] by replacing 4 residues with tryptophan reducing hemolytic activity compared to the parental peptide. The fourth approach comprises the design of entirely synthetic peptides. The cationic KALA peptide was synthesized as an agent for DNA oligonucleotides delivery into cells [19]. It is highly charged with a repetitive amino acids motif that destabilizes membranes and binds to DNA with a high affinity. A sequential homolog of KALA is anionic peptide GALA [20]. The peptide has structure homologous to KALA peptide but the positively charged lysine residues were replaced with negatively charged glutamic acids. The peptide was designed to interact with lipid bilayer preferentially at acidic pH of late endosomes.",

            "text": "Despite the fact that many peptides have been described to have virolytic activity, they have never been comprehensively compared to each other. One of the reasons could be the biosafety concerns. Experiments with active viruses, such as Ebola or Marburg can be conducted by very few laboratories in strictly controlled biosafety environment. Even less dangerous viruses such as HIV require special laboratory environment and trained staff. In order to facilitate future research aiming at design and testing of new antiviral peptides, we designed a virolytic assay based on non-toxic and non-infectious virus-like particles (VLPs). VLPs resemble parental viruses by their structure. They usually carry some structural proteins necessary for the virus capsid assembly, virus envelope membrane derived from the host cells and virus envelope protein necessary for recognition of cellular receptors. Hence, we have constructed VLPs imitating the Ebola virus. Expression of structural protein VP40 is actually the only prerequisite for the formation and production of VLPs. Fluorescent VLPs based on filoviruses were described previously. Martines et al. [21] have constructed GFP-VP40 fusion protein for visualization of VLPs in dendritic cells. Fluorescent Marburg virus VLPs containing red fluorescent protein were used for live-cell imaging of Marburg virus-infected cells [22]. However, the aim of this work was to develop a simple system to quantify the release of the viral content or the loss of membrane permeability caused by lytic peptides. For that purpose, we cannot use fluorescent VLPs and that is why we chose an approach where the viral membrane separates an enzyme activity from its substrate. In order to achieve as high sensitivity as possible, we have used luciferase reporter being fused to a structural protein of Ebola virus VP40 and its membrane poorly permeable substrate furimazine.",

The NLuc substrate is a newly developed coelenterazine derivative furimazine [23] that has been optimized for NLuc to provide brighter fluorescence and a greater chemical stability. We have designed an assay evaluating membranolytic or pore forming properties of peptides reflecting the activity of NLuc after pre-treatment of VLPs with the peptides. The assay carried out with several different peptides is sensitive, reliable and reflects the results of infectious lentiviral vectors inactivation. It can be used for easy enzymatic screening of new peptides or membrane destabilizing drugs for antiviral therapies. VLPs can be modified with envelope proteins of a broad spectrum of viruses, therefore, cytotoxic peptides selectively targeted to inactivate specific highly pathogenic viruses can be evaluated in the common laboratories without regard for special biosafety conditions.",

The virus particles were produced with a hybrid between rabies and VSV envelope protein leading to the highest yield and infectivity for HEK reporter cells (unpublished observation). Already 24 h after the infection there were apparent differences in the infectivity of viral vectors treated with tested peptides (Fig. 2\nA). The most profound inhibitory effect was triggered by melittin and CAM-W, where at 5 \u03bcM concentration a very few of GFP-expressing cells were found (quantification of GFP fluorescence is shown in Fig. 2B). CAM-W exhibited a strong inhibitory effect even at 1 \u03bcM concentration while at the same concentration many viruses remain infectious after melittin treatment. The substantial antiviral effect was noted for other cationic peptides hecate and KALA; though the inhibition became apparent only at 5 \u03bcM concentration of the peptides. The least inhibitory peptide was SMAP29. There are surprising differences among anionic peptides. While maximin H5 had only a small effect on virus infectivity, the GALA peptide behaved as a remarkably potent inhibitor despite the fact that the peptide should achieve active conformation in acidic pH. Because we could not exclude a possibility that some peptides might increase the virus infectivity the multiplicity of infection (MOI) was chosen 0.8. Measurements of GFP fluorescence (Fig. 1B) has revealed that maximin H5 and KALA in 1 \u03bcM concentration might slightly increase the amount of produced GFP but the increase is not significant. In order to exclude the possibility that the peptides present in the diluted lentivirus samples can inhibit cells growth we have treated HEK cells for 16 h with 1.25 \u03bcM peptides, the concentration corresponding to the peptide concentration in diluted virus sample containing the highest 5 \u03bcM peptide concentration. Hoechst33258 staining confirmed that the peptides do not interfere with cells growth or the viability (Fig. 2C). The health of cells is further confirmed by the presence of multiple mitotic events apparent on Hoechst33258 stained nuclei. No morphological changes such as cells detachment or rounding were seen in the phase contrast images.",

The membrane lysis is initiated by the attachment of the peptides to the surface of the membrane.

[28] have shown that pores formed by melittin reach size of 2.5\u20133 nm allowing passage of compounds up to several kDa. It is assumed that pore formation causes loss of membrane potential and loss of ions gradients incompatible with vital cell functions. However, the proposed mechanism does not explain virolytic properties of peptides because enveloped viruses do not depend on biochemical gradients. Jackman et al. [29] propose that the lysis of the viral membrane is strain induced. The membrane enveloping the virus core is highly curved imposing substantial stress. Formation of pores then induces membrane tearing relieving the curvature induced stress.",

The data corresponds with the results of Ji et al. [18], where CAM-W at 10 mg/l (equals \u223c1 \u03bcM) has relatively low lytic activity. Unfortunately, as the authors did not analyze the hemolytic activity of the peptide at higher concentrations we cannot directly compare our results. At the concentration of 1 \u03bcM CAM-W induces hemolysis of 10% of RBCs, which was the same as melittin (Fig. 1). The complete lysis was achieved at 10 \u03bcM concentration for both peptides making CAM-W and melittin the most hemolytic peptides in the assay. In available literature, CAM-W is described as a peptide with the low hemolytic activity, however, the tests were performed with sheep RBCs [17]. Our results show that human RBCs can be lysed quite more efficiently, while equine RBCs were more resistant to the peptides-mediated lysis. Such contradictions are not uncommon. Low concentrations of ovispirin-1 and protegrin PG-1 are hemolytic for human and mouse RBCs, however, they are essentially non-hemolytic for sheep or bovine RBCs [15]. This emphasizes the flaw in the use of hemolytic tests to evaluate the potential lytic activity of peptides against viruses. The results of hemolytic assay correspond to some extend with cytotoxicity assay except for CAM-W peptide. This peptide shows lower cytotoxic activity compared to melittin, which makes it potentially an interesting antiviral compound.",

Both, anionic peptides, maximin H5 and GALA caused a very small release of hemoglobin from human RBCs but both peptides show a moderate ability to release NLuc from Ebola-like VLPs. The low hemolytic activity of maximin H5 and GALA can be explained by the fact that the assay was performed at a neutral pH where side chains of glutamic and aspartic acids are deprotonated and the peptides cannot form structured \u03b1-helix, which is a necessary prerequisite for the pore formation in the target membrane [20]. Interestingly, GALA was able to inhibit infection of cells with the recombinant lentiviruses delivering GFP gene to the infected cells. We assume that the effect is not mediated by direct lysis of the viral membrane but the disruption of the membrane is delayed and probably happens after virus internalization in the endosome and after acidification inside the late endosomes where GALA can adopt \u03b1-helical conformation.",

            "text": "Viruses are normally internalized through receptor-mediated endocytosis sequestering the virus particles into endosomes that are acidified along the endocytic pathway. The decline in pH activates the envelope proteins that initiate the process of fusion between the virus membrane and endosomal membrane resulting in a release of the virus capsid into the cell cytoplasm. However, the GALA peptide present in the endosome converts from a random coil to an amphipathic \u03b1-helix and forms a channel inside a viral membrane leading to virus inactivation. Alternatively, the peptide can embed itself into the endosome membrane forming an ion pore preventing endosome acidification similar to M2 proton channel of influenza virus [30], [31]. The insufficient change in pH of endosome can prevent the viral envelope protein from effective fusion with endosomal membrane and release of the viral cargo into the cytoplasm. The inhibitory activity of maximin H5 is minor compared to GALA. We can only speculate on the reason. One possibility might reflect a total negative charge of the peptides. Maximin H5 carries three aspartic acid residues providing charge \u22123 while GALA harbors 7 glutamic acid residues reaching net charge \u22127, which makes it far more negative and, therefore, more sensitive to pH changes. The pH dependent lysis of VLPs with anionic peptides can be probably used in the virolytic assay by adjusting pH to the values common in the late endosomes, though we have not studied the effect of pH in our system.",

Despite the difficulty with liposome preparation and artificial composition, they are valuable tool due to an easy use and possibility to devise relatively simple biochemical assays. Our enzymatic VLPs provide several advantages over liposomes. The sensitivity of the assay is comparable to the use of liposomes, however, the preparation of particles is not encumbered by the requirements for the equipment necessary for the liposome preparation. The VLPs are inherently stable and do not aggregate as easily as synthetic liposomes. Due to the fact that they are derived from live cells, the membrane composition is much more closely related to the real viruses. The VLPs can incorporate a specific viral envelope protein further mimicking the studied virus. Besides that, they contain other membrane proteins including glycosylated extracellular proteins identical to infectious viruses. Results of membranolytic assays carried out on naked liposomes can be misleading as many proteins present on the viruses or virus-like particles surfaces can interfere with the peptide. The peptides can be also sequestered by charged peptidoglycans at the virus surface effectively shielding the membrane from the peptide. In that respect, the results derived with the use of enzymatic VLPs are biologically more relevant compared to data acquired with the use of synthetic liposomes.",

Our results indicate that the use of CAM-W should be considered in similar clinical applications due to its reduced cytotoxicity compared to melittin.
