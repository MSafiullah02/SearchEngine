Most developing countries suffer shortages of well trained-health personnel which have contributed to the underperformance of health systems and primary health care. Is it possible to create saving and credit cooperatives that can support health research and health service delivery in developing countries? A concept of micro Research or microgrants was put forward where small grants could be provided to researchers in developing countries (Boccia et al. 2011; Geissler and Leatherman 2015; Kollmann et al. 2015; Seiber and Robinson 2007) . The challenges associated with this concept though, have been that most often the donors for the microgrants already have selected subjects that they are interested in, which most often are not the pressing needs in the affected countries (MacDonald and Kabakyenga 2008). Secondly, this is not a sustainable solution as microgrants are only given for a short period of time and when the grant runs out, the study is abandoned. This creates not only false hopes in the communities where the studies are conducted but also a lack of trust in groups that come with health interventions into the community due to lack of long-term benefits.",

The programme which started in Bangladesh in 1972 has over the years expanded into 10 countries in Asia (Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Philippines), Africa (Tanzania, Liberia, Uganda, Sierra Leone and South Sudan) and in the Caribbean (Haiti). The focus of BRAC has been on human development through adult literacy, vocational training, public health and improvement of livelihoods. The target populations for BRAC are the poorest of the poor, the landless, small farmers, artisans and vulnerable women. Through provision of micro loans, including follow-up and careful evaluation of their work, BRAC is a success story in the use of microfinance for human development.",

Instead of improving their livelihoods, to some microfinance has plunged them into utter poverty. This has led to lack of willingness in participating in development projects with a microfinance component. This has also led to the development of local microfinance schemes based in social networks within the community. Since members decide on the conditions of repayment, the conditions are manageable. Most people in rural areas in developing countries are already struggling with poverty and while microfinance schemes might provide financial security to some, shocks such as disease can easily affect the financial stability of a poor household. In case of illness within the household, finances might be easily channelled from businesses to support the health expenditures, thereby affecting the business. For the very poor, microfinance schemes may seem out of their reach, because they have neither the resources nor collateral to obtain the loans (Buckley 1997; Littlefield et al. 2003; Nasir 2013; Swope 2007) . Training schemes that can instill skills in disciplines such as sustainable agriculture, and how communities can use the available resources sustainably at the same time improving their livelihoods, could also be of greater benefit to the rural poor.",

The reliance on agriculture though tends to decrease when household income levels rise, as observed in sub-Saharan Africa. In India and many parts of sub-Saharan Africa and most developing countries, farmers are opting for diversification rather than farming only as the small-scale farming or land-based livelihood are proving unsustainable and cannot support their families for food and fodder for their livestock. This trend has been observed in Uganda, Kenya, Nigeria, and Malawi. Small-scale businesses such as hawking, selling of second-hand clothes, car parts and scrapped metal and goods, selling readymade food are on the rise. This small-scale market boom has also resulted in the rise of theft for those who want to make quick money. There is a common pattern in most developing countries where the very poor and those who are relatively well-off tend to have a more diverse livelihood than the middle range income earners (Ellis 1996) . When a rural household has diverse sources of income earning activities, its chances of survival financially are better than those of a household which has only one source (Ellis 1996) . But there are also cases where a household may have less diversification, that is, only one or two income sources with a strong income base and well-established platforms and are achieving more from their livelihoods.",

Human capital is an asset in diversification for rural livelihoods because the more the skills attained by a household the easier it is to diversify. At the family level, the more the skills in a household, the more they can venture into different markets thereby widening their ability to make money and support their family. At an individual level, diversification in markets and ways of making a living can also aid in raising social capital and status. Better-off families are able to diversify more favourably than poor families as they possess the financial and social capital that is lacking in the poor families. Delivery of quality education and training in rural areas is required to attain sustainable rural livelihoods. Owing to low human capital, the rural poor tend to diversify in less profitable labour markets than their wealthier counterparts. The rural poor will mostly be involved in part-time and casual labour that does not require skills. As a result the poor make very little income, which results in failure to create opportunities that could earn them more money, and they are denied opportunities to improve their status-an example of low human capital (Ellis 1996) .",
