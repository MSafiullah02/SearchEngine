COVID-19 belongs to the family of betacoronavirus and shares similar imaging and clinical features with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS); however, no cases of acute pulmonary embolism have been reported in MERS and only one in severe acute respiratory syndrome. [1] . Elevated D-dimer values are common in COVID-19 patients, even in the absence of thrombophlebitis and acute pulmonary embolism [1] . Our observation highlights the fact that in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with worsening of clinical respiratory symptoms, chest CT angiography should be performed to detect superimposed acute pulmonary embolism. All clinicians involved in this emergency should be aware of this issue.",
