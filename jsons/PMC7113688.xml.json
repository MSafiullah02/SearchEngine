Unfortunately, the current commercially vaccines fail to provide sustainable disease control and prevention (Huang and Meng, 2010, Murtaugh and Genzow, 2011, Yoo et al., 2004). Antiviral therapeutics provide a pivotal tool for combating viral infections, especially for cases in which existing vaccines fail to match the circulating virus. Therefore, an alternative measure to control PRRSV, such as pharmacological intervention, is needed. Traditional Chinese medicines provide a valuable source for promising antiviral drugs. Many natural compounds and compositions have been proven to have antiviral activities, including against PRRSV, such as flavaspidic acid AB (Yang et al., 2013), ouabain, valinomycin, bufalin (Karuppannan et al., 2012), and morpholino oligomer (Opriessnig et al., 2011).",

As shown in Fig. 1A, no appreciable cytotoxicity in MARC-145 cells could be observed at concentrations ranging from 200 to 800 \u03bcM. To test whether glycyrrhizin has antiviral activity against PRRSV, MARC-145 cells were pretreated with glycyrrhizin at the indicated concentrations and then infected with PRRSV strain WUH3 (at 0.1 PFU/cell). Plaque assays were performed to determine virus titers of the infected cells at the indicated times post-infection. As shown in Fig. 1\nB, treatment with glycyrrhizin resulted in a notably significant reduction of PRRSV titer in a dose-dependent manner at all tested time points. To further confirm the reduction of virus titer induced by treatment with glycyrrhizin, we also tested the expression of PRRSV nonstructural protein 2 (Nsp2) using western blot with monoclonal antibody against the Nsp2 of PRRSV strain WHU3 (Wang et al., 2013a). The results showed that the expression of PRRSV Nsp2 was notably significantly reduced following treatment with glycyrrhizin, and this inhibition also occurred in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the inhibition of Nsp2 expression by glycyrrhizin could be observed at all examined time points (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that treatment with glycyrrhizin inhibits PRRSV proliferation.",

To further explore the possible mechanism of action through which glycyrrhizin inhibits PRRSV infection, we first attempted to investigate the growth kinetics of PRRSV. MARC-145 cells were infected with PRRSV at 0.1 PFU/cell. Both the cells and culture medium were titrated by plaque assay at 0 hpi and every 2 h between 6 and 26 hpi, as well as 36 and 48 hpi. The results showed that infectious PRRSV could be detected in the supernatant at 10 hpi (Fig. 2\nA), suggesting that progeny virus particles were released after 8 hpi. It should be noted that there is slight difference between the virus titers of Figs. 1B and 2A. We speculated that this difference was resulted from the different cell treatment methods because cells were washed three times with PBS in the experiment of Fig. 1B when compared to Fig. 2A.",

MARC-145 cells cultured in 6-well plates were pre-chilled at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h, then were incubated for another 2 h at 4 \u00b0C with different concentrations of PRRSV (1.0, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001 PFU/cell). The virus-containing medium was replaced by fresh medium containing glycyrrhizin (800 \u03bcM) or PBS, and the temperature was shifted to 37 \u00b0C to allow virus entry. Three hours later, the cells were carefully washed with PBS to remove the non-internalized virus particles and glycyrrhizin or PBS and the cells were overlaid with 1.8% (w/v) Bacto agar mixed 1:1 with 2\u00d7 DMEM containing 0.05 mg/ml neutral red. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 72 h, plaques were counted directly. The results showed that infectious virus titers were reduced by approximately 1000-fold when glycyrrhizin was added during the penetration stage (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that glycyrrhizin inhibited PRRSV internalization to MARC-145 cells. The titers of three PBS control groups (0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 PFU/cell) are not shown because of the countless viral plaques, while the viral plaques of GL-treated groups are zero at 0.001 and 0.0001 PFU/cell. Previous work has shown that glycyrrhizin suppresses virus penetration by modifying the fluidity of cellular membranes, and through this mechanism reduces HIV-1 and IAV infection (Harada, 2005, Wolkerstorfer et al., 2009). It has been demonstrated that PRRSV makes entry into MARC-145 cells through a microfilament-dependent endocytic mechanism (Kreutz and Ackermann, 1996). Thus, glycyrrhizin most likely inhibits PRRSV penetration by interfering with the cellular membranes, eventually leading to a reduction in endocytosis. Further experiments will be needed to confirm this hypothesis.",

As shown in Fig. 2E, no noticeable differences were observed in PRRSV titers between glycyrrhizin-treated and PBS-treated cells. However, compared with the PBS control, the supernatants of cells treated with glycyrrhizin had a slight increase in virus titer. We speculate that the residual glycyrrhizin in the supernatants interferes with the penetration process, resulting in a slight increase of virus titer. Taken together, these results suggest that glycyrrhizin does not inhibit PRRSV release.",

There are multiple mechanisms by which glycyrrhizin could reduce virus yields. For example, glycyrrhizin inhibits the release of infectious HCV particles and modifies HBV-related antigens expression (Matsumoto et al., 2013, Sato et al., 1996). Furthermore, it has been intravenously used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in Japan and improves liver function with occasional complete recovery from hepatitis (Sato et al., 1996), supporting its safety. Thus, glycyrrhizin could potentially serve as an agent for preventing PRRSV infection. Further studies in live animals will be necessary to confirm the value of inhibiting PRRSV infection in vivo.",
