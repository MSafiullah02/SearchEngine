Subsequent familial aggregation, twin, and gene linkage studies have provided evidence to support this. Studies of twins allow comparisons between monozygotic twins who share 100% of their genes and dizygotic twins who share approximately 50% of their genes. The greater occurrence of asthma in monozygotic twins, even those raised in different environments, is evidence for a genetic component. In family studies, asthma is more common in children of allergic asthmatic parents than in those of nonallergic asthmatic parents, underscoring the importance of atopy. Asthma occurs less frequently in the children of parents who are nonasthmatic and nonallergic. Applying a specific risk ratio for a given family is difficult because of the different environmental variables that can contribute to the development of asthma and also the differences in the population prevalence of asthma. Generally, in the United States, if one parent has allergic asthma, the child has approximately a 20% chance of developing asthma, and if both parents have allergic asthma, the child has approximately a 40% chance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Genetics"}, {"text": "The inheritance pattern of asthma is a \"complex genetic disorder\" similar to hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Asthma cannot be classified as simply having an autosomal dominant, recessive, or sex-linked mode of inheritance. It is polygenic. Several gene linkages have been shown with asthma. These are summarized in Table 6 .1 . The primary chromosomes and regions that have been identified include chromosome band 5q31 (total IgE and eosinophils, interleukin [IL]-4, IL-5, IL-13, CD14), chromosome 6 (major histocompatibility complex, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]), chromosome band 11q13 (\u03b2-chain of the high-affinity IgE receptor), chromosome 12q (interferon [IFN]-\u03b3, nitric oxide synthetase, leukotriene A 4 hydrolase, signal transducer and activator of transcription [STAT]-6), and chromosome 13q (cysteinyl leukotriene 2 receptor). Recently, the ADAM33 gene on chromosome 20, which encodes a protein-processing enzyme (a metalloprotease) that is expressed in lung fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells, has been found to be commonly associated with asthma. In addition to the effect of the gene itself, the interaction between the gene and the environment may also have a role. Once specific sequences are identified for genetic susceptibility, the gene-environment interaction will need to be studied to help understand the importance of the relationship of the gene and the environment on the overall asthma process.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 319, "end": 326, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Genetics"}, {"text": "Pharmacogenetics is another key area in the gene-asthma relationship.

Because of linkage disequilibrium, however, individuals with polymorphisms at one genetic locus may or may not have changes at another position. Therefore, a \"bad\" polymorphism at one site may be countered by a \"good\" polymorphism at another site. At this point, however, it appears that chromosome 5 arg16/arg16 homozygous asthma patients have an increase in asthmatic exacerbations and decrease in peak expiratory flow when taking albuterol regularly. If these results are confirmed, they could have a significant effect on how one-sixth of asthma patients in the United States with the arg16/arg16 phenotype are treated. Another example of this is the lipoxygenase pathway, which results in the synthesis of the cysteinyl leukotrienes. The promoter region of 5-lipoxygenase has variants labeled \"wild type\" and \"non-wild type.\" The wild type variant is the more common and more effective enzyme and, thus, produces more leukotrienes. Because of less effective enzymatic activity, the non-wild type produces fewer leukotrienes. Consequently, blockage of the leukotriene pathway would be expected to result in better clinical outcomes in the wild type than in the non-wild type. This was borne out when the use of leukotriene inhibitors was found to increase forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) in the wild-type asthma patients compared with the non-wild type.

Persistent airway inflammation is considered the characteristic feature of severe, mild, and even asymptomatic asthma. The pattern of inflammation varies with the severity and the chronicity of the disease and may also determine the responsiveness of the patient to treatment. Many inflammatory cells, cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion proteins contribute to airway inflammation in asthma. One mechanism that initiates airway inflammation is antigen exposure in sensitized individuals. This results in the activation of the resident cells of the airways (mast cells) and the recruitment of inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophils) into the airways (Fig. 6 .1 ). The antigen binds with specific IgE antibody bound to mast cells. This binding activates mast cells to release preformed histamine and newly generated leukotrienes and prostaglandins along with transcription of numerous cytokines.

Structural changes associated with airway hyperresponsiveness include patchy desquamated epithelium, thickening of the reticular collagen layer of the basement membrane, and hypertrophy and hyperplasia of airway smooth muscle. Airway hyperresponsiveness itself, however, is not unique to asthma.

Multiple factors cause excessive airway narrowing in fatal asthma, including increased production of mucus, increased shortening of airway smooth muscle, alterations in the mechanics of the airway wall, loss of inflammatory inhibitory factors, and increased permeability from epithelial damage. One of the most common and characteristic findings is the occlusion of the bronchial lumen by mucus plugs. This occurs in airways of all sizes. Of interest, it has been calculated that the contents of the submucus glands alone cannot cause excessive narrowing; therefore, it is the accumulation of the mucus and the additional effects of smooth muscle shortening that cause excessive narrowing of the airway. The goblet cell hyperplasia that leads to excessive mucus production likely represents a reparative response to epithelial damage in an attempt to restore the normal protective barrier. The epithelial damage appears to have several sources. The inflammatory milieu results in the production of proteins, proteases, and chemicals toxic to the epithelium. Concomitant viral infections, often seen in fatal asthma, damage the epithelium. In addition to stimulating goblet cell hyperplasia, damaged epithelium results in easier access of irritants to nerve endings, enhanced penetration of allergen particles, loss of inactivation of proinflammatory peptides, and reduced mucociliary clearance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Fatal Asthma"}, {"text": "The inflammatory pattern in fatal asthma is variable, with eosinophils and T-lymphocytes as the predominant cell types. Neutrophils have also been implicated in having a major role in a subset of patients with fatal asthma. Edema of the airway is regarded as an important feature of fatal asthma, but it is difficult to quantify. Edema contributes to the increased wall thickness in fatal asthma, causing a more pronounced decrease in the diameter of the airway lumen with the contraction of smooth muscle. Similarly, one of the hallmarks of severe and fatal asthma, the thickening of the subepithelial basement membrane zone with dense deposition of collagen fibrils, exponentially reduces airway diameter with smooth muscle contraction.

Specific clues can be found in the timing, activities involved, and the environment in which symptoms occur; for example, symptoms triggered primarily at nighttime or by exercise, tobacco smoke, strong emotional expression, weather changes, aerosolized irritants, or cold air exposures are particularly helpful in establishing the diagnosis of asthma. There may be specific allergen triggers such as exposure to pollens, molds, dust mites, cockroaches, or pets. A frequent trigger for many asthma patients is a viral upper respiratory tract infection that can lead to an exacerbation of asthma and an increase in asthma symptoms that can persist for weeks after the infection has resolved.

Specific description of the respiratory difficulty 2. Details about the frequency of respiratory symptoms 6.4 On physical examination, the classic sign is expiratory wheezing or a prolonged expiratory phase. Wheeze is defined as a continuous musical sound heard during chest auscultation that lasts longer than 250 ms. Wheezes can originate from airways of any size and can be high or low pitched. In asthma, wheezes may vary in character as the degree of airway narrowing varies from place to place in the lung. Auscultation allows identification of the characteristics and location of the wheezing as well as variations in air entry among different lung regions. Wheezing requires sufficient airflow to produce the sound; hence, an asthma patient with a severely tight airway may not have a wheeze. Close attention should be paid to the chest examination. Findings that can suggest another process include a hyperexpanded chest, cyanosis, stridor, decreased inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio, and rhonchi. Crackles or other adventitious breath sounds suggest pulmonary parenchymal disease or pulmonary edema. The neck examination should include palpation for supratracheal lymphadenopathy or tracheal deviation. The cardiac examination should focus on the identification of congenital heart disease in children and congestive heart failure in adults. Nasal and skin evaluations are also helpful. The presence of pale, boggy nasal turbinates with clearish discharge is suggestive of allergic rhinitis, which likely contributes to allergic asthma. Nasal polyps are associated typically with a more severe underlying asthma and, in children, can be a clue to underlying cystic fibrosis. Skin findings of atopic dermatitis are consistent with an atopic diathesis, which often can include chronic rhinitis and asthma.

Baughman and Loudon compared recorded sounds from the neck and chest in patients with upper airway obstruction, patients with asthma, and extubated patients with no airway obstruction.

The musical sound in patients with stridor occurred during inspiration, but the sounds in those with asthma occurred predominantly during expiration. In addition, the signal was more intense over the neck than over the chest in those with stridor; for asthma patients, the reverse was true.

The air-flow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases, primarily caused by cigarette smoking. The diagnosis of COPD should be considered for any patient who has cough, sputum production, or dyspnea or a history of exposure to risk factors, primarily smoking, for the disease. The diagnosis requires spirometry; a decreased FEV 1 -to-forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio establishes an obstructive process. This alone though is not definitive, because the same pattern can be seen in asthma. The key differentiating features are the clinical presentation, lack of reversibility with treatment, exposure (primarily smoking) history, and the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (D lco ) with pulmonary function testing (Table 6 .3 ). Dlco is normal or increased 6.4 Clinical Presentation and Differential Diagnosis 205 206 6 Asthma in asthma and decreased in COPD. Some patients with asthma cannot be distinguished from those with COPD, and a subset of patients may have both asthma and COPD. The management of these patients should be similar to that of those with asthma. The primary treatment for COPD consists of bronchodilators, glucocorticoids, and oxygen therapy. The bronchodilators most commonly used are \u03b2-agonists, anticholinergic drugs, and, less commonly, methylxanthines. These medications can be used in combination in both short-and long-acting forms. For example, a patient with stage 2 COPD may use a long-acting anticholinergic agent in conjunction with a long-acting \u03b2-agonist agent daily, adding a short-acting anticholinergic or \u03b2-agonist as needed. The effect of glucocorticoids in COPD is less dramatic than in asthma. In some studies, inhaled corticosteroids cause a small increase in FEV 1 , a small reduction in bronchial reactivity in stable COPD, and a reduction in COPD exacerbations. In other studies, no significant changes were noted. Currently, a trial of inhaled corticosteroids can be instituted in those with stage 3 COPD and continued if clinical improvement is noted over a 6-month period and withdrawn if no clinical improvement is noted. Although neither chronic bronchitis nor emphysema is required in the definition of COPD, the terms are often used in describing patients with COPD. Chronic bronchitis, traditionally labeled as \"blue bloater,\" is a clinical diagnosis defined by the presence of chronic productive cough for 3 months in each of two successive years. Emphysema, traditionally labeled as \"pink puffer,\" is a pathology term that describes abnormal permanent dilatation of airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles, which results in poor oxygen diffusion into the pulmonary vasculature.

Such a response is suggestive of a diagnosis of asthma. Some patients with asthma do not exhibit a significant bronchodilator response because of marked underlying inflammation. These patients often have a low baseline FEV 1 and may require anti-inflammatory treatment to demonstrate reversibility. Methacholine bronchoprovocation testing can be performed to measure airway hyperresponsiveness. Methacholine is a cholinergic agonist that stimulates muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle and produces bronchoconstriction. In patients who have asthma, the airway smooth muscle is more sensitive to methacholine, resulting in bronchoconstriction at lower dosages, thus differentiating patients with asthma from those without asthma. Although different protocols are used for methacholine challenge, the results are often presented as the provocative concentration that results in a 20% decrease in FEV 1 . One method for performing methacholine challenge uses a 0.25-mg mL \u22121 methacholine solution for inhalation.

Conversely, variable intrathoracic obstruction, which is usually due to tumor, causes increased obstruction during expiration. This occurs because the positive pleural pressure during expiration causes compression of the airway at the site of the lesion.

It is estimated that 75% of patients with persistent asthma have some component of allergic asthma. Common allergens associated with allergic asthma include tree, grass, and weed pollens; molds; dust mites; animal dander; and cockroach. The diagnosis of allergic asthma should be suspected when the signs and symptoms of asthma correlate closely with the local patterns of pollen and mold release. When perennial symptoms of asthma are present, the temporal relationship may not be obvious because of continuous allergen exposure. Potential causes of perennial allergic asthma include animal dander, dust mite, cockroach, and, depending on the climate, pollens and molds.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Allergic Asthma"}, {"text": "In nonallergic asthma, IgE-mediated sensitivity is not present.

However, it is difficult to easily define asthma severity because it can vary over time. The two primary measures used to define asthma severity are current impairment and future risk. These two measures do not correlate perfectly with each other, and both need to be considered to adequately address disease severity. Compounding the variables used in trying to define asthma severity are the measures used to define asthma control and the responsiveness of the asthma to treatment. Also, studies suggest that measures of health care use are an important addition to the traditional measures of asthma severity. Considering all this, the American Thoracic Society sponsored an expert workshop to develop a consensus definition for severe asthma that would apply not just to the initial evaluation but also to patients receiving treatment for asthma. The definition of the American Thoracic Society is based on a combination of major and minor criteria that aim to identify subjects with inadequate control despite treatment with corticosteroids. According to this definition, subjects with severe asthma must meet one of two major criteria: (1) the use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids or (2) the requirement for very frequent oral corticosteroid use (>50% of the year). Also, two of seven minor criteria must be met: (1) the use of additional controller medications besides inhaled corticosteroids, (2) the presence of daily symptoms requiring rescue inhaler, (3) reduced lung function (FEV 1 < 80% of predicted and diurnal PEF variability >20%), (4) one or more urgent care asthma visits per year, (5) recurrent (\u22653) exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids per year, (6) clinical deterioration with corticosteroid withdrawal, and (7) a history of a near-fatal asthma event (Table 6 .6 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1876, "end": 1884, "text": "(Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Initial Evaluation of Chronic Asthma Severity"}, {"text": "The \"current impairment\" in asthma is an evaluation of the frequency and intensity of symptoms and functional limitations the patient is experiencing. The goal is to achieve minimal or no chronic symptoms, including nocturnal awakenings; minimal or no need for acute rescue therapy, such as inhaled \u03b2 2 -agonists; establishment of a normal lifestyle with no limitations on activities, including exercise; and normalization of pulmonary function. In 1997 and 2002, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) sponsored by the National Institutes of Health published comprehensive guidelines that classify asthma severity as mild intermittent or mild, moderate, or severe persistent asthma on the basis of symptoms and pulmonary function findings. Patients with mild intermittent asthma experience symptoms once or twice weekly and have normal or near-normal spirometry and PEFRs. Patients with symptoms 3 days of the week or more are classified as having persistent asthma. The degree of the asthma (mild, moderate, severe) then depends Minor characteristics 1.

With the release of new information and the development of new therapies, an update of the NAEPP guidelines was released to the public for comment in February 2007, and the completed update was released in late 2007. One significant new concept is differentiating asthma \"severity\" from \"control\" and the incorporation of these areas as they relate to risk and impairment. Severity assessment is performed to initiate therapy, and control assessment is performed to adjust therapy. Separating the two concepts dispels the common misperception that well-controlled asthma is synonymous with mild asthma and poorly controlled asthma is synonymous with severe asthma. The classification of asthma according to severity for children ages 0-4, children ages 5-12, and for those older than 12 years according to the new guideline is shown in Tables 6.7 , 6.8 , and 6.9 . Characterization of the severity is critical for outlining the initial treatment plan (see below). This is particularly important when separating patients with mild intermittent asthma from those with mild persistent asthma. For mild persistent asthma, a daily antiinflammatory medication is recommended, whereas mild intermittent asthma requires primarily a short-acting \u03b2-agonist to be used as needed. Future risk is also critical in defining asthma severity and, thus, in outlining an overall management plan. Future risk considers the likelihood of future asthma exacerbations. This is important because exacerbations account for loss of time at work or school, decreased quality of life, and much of the cost of asthma care. The other primary future risk involved in asthma is the progressive loss of pulmonary function. Contrary to previous belief, asthma is not always a totally reversible process. Severe and irreversible airflow obstruction, accelerated loss of pulmonary function, and remodeling of all the tissue elements of the airway wall can be found in chronic \"never smoker\" asthma patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Initial Evaluation of Chronic Asthma Severity"}, {"text": "Of the future risks, the one that has been best assessed is asthma exacerbations.

Although these groups overlap, the acute instigators most often include infections, allergens, exercise, vocal cord dysfunction, and medications. The chronic contributors can be remembered with the mnemonic \"airsmog\" ( a llergens, i rritants/pollutants, r hinitis/sinusitis, s moking, m edications, o ccupational exposures, o bstructive sleep apnea, and g astroesophageal reflux) ( Table 6 .10 ).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 827, "end": 834, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Evaluation of Factors Contributing to Asthma Severity"}, {"text": "Allergen exposure can affect asthma in two critical ways: as a common precipitant of asthmatic symptoms and the inception of asthma through chronic airway inflammation.

The formation of IgE antibody to the airborne allergens does not usually occur until age 2-3 years. Therefore, aeroallergen-induced asthma is uncommon until that time.

The same aeroallergens important in allergic rhinitis also contribute to asthma exacerbations. One aeroallergen in particular that appears to trigger severe asthma exacerbations is Alternaria alternata . Alternaria has been implicated as a risk factor for sudden respiratory arrest in adolescents and young adults with asthma. Tree, grass, and weed pollens can also trigger a seasonal asthma pattern. This is often associated with upper respiratory tract symptoms.

Because this virus is ubiquitous (nearly 100% of children are infected by age 2 years), additional genetic, environmental, sequential, or developmental factors must contribute to its linkage with asthma. Children who have persistent symptoms of asthma or develop asthma after an RSV infection usually have other risk factors such as a maternal history of asthma and increased IgE levels. Precisely how RSV infections pathogenically induce asthma has not been established. Chlamydia and Mycoplasma spp. are atypical bacteria associated with ciliary dysfunction and epithelial damage in airway cells. Their presence in the airway has been associated with chronic asthma. Although their presence does not provide a causal link to asthma, macrolide treatment of patients with chronic asthma, both with and without the presence of the bacteria, produced improvement only in those with the bacteria.

However, there is no test or clinical pattern that predicts an asthma flare with the use of a \u03b2-blocker. If a cardioselective \u03b2-blocker is to be used, the patient should be counseled on the possibility of an asthma exacerbation and appropriate measures should be instituted to manage a possible exacerbation. Nonselective \u03b2-blockers should be avoided. Aspirin and other NSAIDs can induce rhinorrhea and bronchospasm in a subset of patients with underlying rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, and asthma. Various terms have been used to describe this phenomenon, including aspirin intolerance, aspirin sensitivity, aspirin-induced asthma, and aspirin idiosyncrasy. Currently, it is called aspirinexacerbating respiratory disease (AERD). Aspirin and other NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1 cause this reaction. Because these reactions are dose dependent, small doses may not induce the reaction, but large doses may. Although aspirin and NSAID exposure trigger a respiratory reaction, sometimes very severe, the underlying asthma and rhinosinusitis continue in the absence of exposure to aspirin or NSAIDs. Except for sensitivity to aspirin and NSAIDs, these patients cannot be differentiated from other patients with asthma and sinus disease. The prevalence of aspirin and NSAID sensitivity among asthma patients with associated rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps is approximately 30-40%. In asthma patients without nasal polyposis, aspirin and NSAID sensitivity is approximately 10%. There is no skin test or in vitro test to identify these patients because the reaction is not IgE mediated. The reaction is mediated by COX-1 inhibition, which results in a decrease in the protective prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) and an increase in the production of inflammatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins. All the NSAIDs that inhibit COX-1 cross-react with aspirin, inducing the respiratory reaction. These include the most commonly used NSAIDs such as indomethacin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. Weak inhibitors of COX-1 such as acetaminophen and salsalate can produce respiratory reactions in patients with AERD, but this typically occurs only with large doses and only in a small proportion of these patients. Selective COX-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib and rofecoxib do not appear to cross-react with aspirin and appear to be safe for patients with AERD.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Medications"}, {"text": "For patients with AERD for whom aspirin or NSAID therapy is critical, such as patients with coronary artery disease who need aspirin prophylaxis, patients with severe arthritis unresponsive to other treatments, or patients with AERD with intractable nasal polyp formation and rhinosinusitis, aspirin can be given through a supervised, graded, desensitization protocol.

Appreciable changes in spirometry in the short term are not typically seen. Esophageal pH monitoring should be performed in asthma patients with GERD symptoms that do not respond to an empiric trial of proton pump inhibitors and in patients in whom asymptomatic GERD (silent GERD) may have a role.

The volume of the medication trapped inside the nebulizer is referred to as the dead volume of the device. This volume is typically in the range of 1-3 mL. Increasing the fill volume helps to decrease the proportion of the dose lost as dead volume. This maneuver increases nebulization time. Considering these factors, a nebulizer fill volume of 4-6 mL is generally recommended. During nebulization, the solution within the nebulizer becomes increasingly concentrated as water evaporates from the solution; therefore, per breath, more medication is delivered late in the course of treatment.

Inhaled corticosteroids should be considered a first-line treatment for patients with mild, moderate, or severe persistent asthma. As a single agent, inhaled corticosteroids are more effective than theophylline, salmeterol, nedocromil, and leukotriene modifiers in the management of asthma. The choice of a specific inhaled corticosteroid depends on the potency of the corticosteroid required and the delivery device. There is a significant difference in the potency among the various inhaled corticosteroids (Table 6 .13 ). Realization of these differences is important in initiating or adjusting therapy. For example, for a patient with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma, a more potent corticosteroid such as budesonide or fluticasone (220 \u00b5g) would be used instead of triamcinolone or beclomethasone in an effort to minimize puffs. In contrast, for a patient with mild persistent asthma, lower potency corticosteroids could be prescribed, such as fluticasone (44 \u00b5g), triamcinolone, or beclomethasone.

Even though they do not have a rapid onset of action that immediately reverses the process, the antiinflammatory properties can help prevent the exacerbation from escalating further and can shorten the time of the exacerbation. In addition to treatment with \u03b2-agonists, many patients with a mild exacerbation of asthma can be treated successfully with a higher-than-recommended dose of inhaled corticosteroid. For example, the dose of inhaled fluticasone may be increased to 220 \u00b5g, two puffs four times daily, instead of the usual top dose of 220 \u00b5g, two puffs twice daily for a 10-day period. Other inhaled corticosteroids can be used similarly by doubling or tripling the highest recommended dose. However, this strategy is less likely to work in patients who have a moderate or severe exacerbation, who overuse a \u03b2-agonist, or who have a severe upper respiratory infection exacerbating their asthma. Short courses of prednisone or other systemic corticosteroid are usually effective for establishing control of an exacerbation of asthma.

For example, a mild or moderate exacerbation that improves considerably with two treatments of nebulized albuterol is often followed by a relapse if corticosteroids, either inhaled or systemic, are not also started or increased. Corticosteroids can also be given intravenously or intramuscularly. There is no evidence that intravenous or intramuscular corticosteroids have a faster onset of action than oral corticosteroids.

The immunologic subtype can be subdivided further into immunologically mediated asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The nonimmunologic subtype is due to an irritant type of reaction, usually with large exposure to the offending substance, and is termed reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS).

The challenge may be conducted by natural exposure of the patient to the work environment or by controlled bronchoprovocation to the suspected substance in the laboratory.

With one method of monitoring, the patient records the PEFR four times daily for 2 weeks at work and for a similar period away from work. This approach has several potential problems, including reproducibility of the readings, compliance and honesty of the patients, and interpretation of the results. Similarly, spirometry can be performed, with measurements of FEV 1 in the workplace compared with measurements made on a nonwork day. This may need to be done repeatedly, because measurement of a single FEV 1 when the patient is at work instead of at home does not have sufficient sensitivity to detect a relation between work and asthma. Another method to determine the effect of the work environment is induced sputum measurement for eosinophils.

The primary recommendations include the use of inhaled corticosteroids as the preferred controller therapy for mild, moderate, or persistent asthma. In addition, for moderate persistent asthma, the combination of a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus a long-acting \u03b2-agonist or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid were considered equal treatment options. In 1979, the FDA established five categories to describe a drug's potential for causing adverse effects during pregnancy (Table 6 .21 ). These categories are based on human data, animal studies, and consideration of whether the benefit of the drug's use during pregnancy outweighs the risk.

In 1993, the Working Group on Asthma and Pregnancy recognized as treatment options during pregnancy the inhaled corticosteroids used at that time, namely, beclomethasone dipropionate, triamcinolone, and flunisolide. Because most of the experience was with beclomethasone, it was considered the inhaled corticosteroid of choice. Since then, reports have supported the overall safety of inhaled corticosteroids in pregnancy. Currently, most of the available safety data are for budesonide, which is considered the preferred inhaled corticosteroid in pregnancy. There have not been data to suggest that other corticosteroids are less safe in pregnancy; therefore, if a pregnant woman with asthma is using an alternative inhaled corticosteroid and doing well, then it is reasonable to continue with the medication. Data about the use of systemic corticosteroids during pregnancy have raised some concern. Although there is no definite increased risk of total congenital malformations, a statistically significant increased risk of oral clefts in infants of mothers treated with oral corticosteroids during the first trimester has been shown. Other adverse outcomes associated with systemic corticosteroid use include preeclampsia, low birth weight, and preterm delivery. However, it is difficult to determine if these outcomes are due to the corticosteroids or the underlying asthma.

This has also been termed, more accurately, exercise-induced bronchoconstriction , because exercise does not induce asthma, but rather exacerbates underlying asthma. Exerciseinduced asthma occurs in 80-90% of patients with asthma and occurs with equal frequency in children and adults. The prevalence of exercise-induced asthma in the general population is approximately 6-13%, and approximately 10% of patients with this condition have no history of asthma or allergic disease. The magnitude of exercise-induced asthma is correlated with the underlying degree of airway hyperresponsiveness; therefore, in many patients with mild, episodic asthma, even strenuous exercise does not cause clinically significant bronchoconstriction. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of exercise-induced asthma is not entirely clear. Under normal breathing conditions, the majority of the warming and humidification of inspired air is done by the nasal mucosa. During vigorous exercise, the large airways are recruited to provide the extra heat and humidity to condition the inspired air. As a person exercises, minute ventilation increases and, thus, respiratory water and heat loss increase. There is disagreement about the relative contributions of airway water loss versus airway cooling versus airway rewarming (after exercise). It is difficult to separate the roles of these potential triggers of exercise-induced asthma, but it has been shown that experimental inhalation of hot dry air can produce this condition but that it is attenuated when the inspired gas is humified and closer to body temperature, implying that water loss is the principal trigger. An interesting observation is that approximately 50% of patients who have exercise-induced asthma are refractory to exercise-induced symptoms if they exercise again within 60 min after the first exercise session. However, if the second exercise challenge is more than 3 hours after the first, the refractory period is lost and the symptoms are similar to those after the first exercise session. The refractory period does not occur if the patient is pretreated with indomethacin, suggesting that prostaglandins help provide protection during the refractory period. Other observations in exercise-induced asthma include an increase in inflammatory mediators, including histamine and leukotrienes C 4 and D 4 , activation of peripheral Th2-type lymphocytes, and eosinophil influx and activation.

The symptoms typically clear within 60 min after the exercise is completed. As noted above, there is a refractory period of up to 3 hours after the initial exercise. If the exercise is resumed within this time, little or no bronchoconstriction occurs. Symptoms are usually more pronounced with aerobic exercise such as with bicycling, running, and cross-country skiing, which involve a significant increase in the ventilatory rate. Activities that are less aerobic, such as weight lifting, diving, or yoga, are less likely to trigger exerciseinduced asthma.

Spirometry is then repeated immediately upon completion of the exercise and repeated 5-10 min after exercise stops. The lowest postexercise value is obtained and compared with the preexercise level. A decrease in the FEV 1 of 15% or more is considered a positive test. If spirometry is not available, peak expiratory flow rates can also be used.

Once the underlying asthma is well controlled, the treatment strategy is the same as for those in whom the exercised-induced symptoms are the only provocateur of airway hyperreactivity. The inhaled short-acting \u03b2-agonists are the primary prophylactic treatment for exercise-induced asthma. They significantly reduce or eliminate the condition in 85-90% of patients. A typical dose is two puffs of albuterol taken 15-45 min before exercise. This protects from exercise-induced asthma for approximately 2 hours, although the duration of bronchodilation is nearly 4 hours. Another approach is the use of chromones. Inhaled cromolyn or nedocromil may be considered for patients in whom short-acting \u03b2-agonists are not fully effective. The dosage can range from 2 to 6 puffs 20 min before exercise. In addition, they may have a synergistic effect when used in combination with \u03b2-agonists. Longacting \u03b2-agonists have also been shown to be effective in prophylaxis of exerciseinduced asthma. The advantage of these medications is that they may be taken hours before exercise. There has been concern about the development of tolerance to the drug over time. Leukotriene receptor antagonists have also shown benefit in exercise-induced asthma. The long half-life of these agents allows for protection from exercise-induced asthma for up to 12 hours after ingestion.

Four different definitions of the diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome have been developed: the pathologic criteria of Churg and Strauss, the clinical criteria of Lanham and colleagues, the clinical criteria from the American College of Rheumatology, and the criteria from the Chapel Hill Concensus Conference(Table 6.22 ). This syndrome is a systemic disease that develops in patients with a history of upper airway disease and sinusitis. Involvement of other organs varies but typically includes the heart, gastrointestinal tract, cerebral vessels, joints, muscles, skin, and nerves. There is no single confirmatory laboratory test for Churg-Strauss syndrome. The diagnosis depends on the clinical presentation of the disease, with its histologic hallmarks. Tissue eosinophilia is essential, and blood eosinophilia in an untreated patient is almost always present. Although perinuclear anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA) is usually detectable, its absence does not rule out the syndrome.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF30": {"text": "22 Definitions of Churg-Strauss syndrome Churg and Strauss 1951 (autopsy pathologic material) History of asthma Tissue eosinophilia Systemic vasculitis Extravascular granulomas Fibrinoid necrosis of connective tissue Lanham et al.
