            "text": "Aims: To determine the detection limit of diagnostic negative staining electron microscopy for the diagnosis of pathogens that could be used for bioterrorism. Methods and Results: Suspensions of vaccinia poxvirus and endospores of Bacillus subtilis were used at defined concentrations as a model for poxviruses and spores of anthrax (Bacillus anthracis), both of which are pathogens that could be used for bioterrorist attacks. Negative staining electron microscopy was performed directly or after sedimentation of these suspensions on to the sample supports using airfuge ultracentrifugation. For both virus and spores, the detection limit using direct adsorption of a 10-ll sample volume onto the sample support was 10 6 particles per ml. Using airfuge ultracentrifugation with a sample volume of 80 ll, the detection limit could be reduced to 10 5 particles per ml for spores and to 5 \u00b7 10 4 particles per ml for poxviruses. The influence on particle detection of incubation time, washing and adsorption procedures was investigated. Conclusions: The reproducibility and sensitivity of the method were acceptable, particularly considering the small sample volume and low particle number applied onto the sample support. Significance and Impact of the Study: Diagnostic negative staining electron microscopy is used for the diagnosis of pathogens in emergency situations because it allows a rapid examination of all particulate matter down to the nanometre scale. This study provides precise detection limit for the method, an important factor for the validation and improvement of the technique.",

Moreover, panic and uncertainty can easily be initiated using harmless mock substances in copycat attacks. Recent examples demonstrating the profound impact and consequences of even limited bioterrorist attacks include the letters containing anthrax spores that were sent shortly after the events of September 2001 (Lane et al. 2001 ) and the distribution of anthrax spores by the Aum cult in Japan in 1995 (Olson 1999) .",

            "text": "In response to these attacks, authorities worldwide increased their preparedness for dealing with bioterrorism (e.g. Nolte et al. 2004) . One major focus was to set up and improve procedures for the rapid and reliable diagnosis (or exclusion) of relevant pathogens in samples suspected to contain such organisms (Sapsford et al. 2008) . Because of a number of unique advantages, electron microscopy formed an integral part of these procedures (Hazelton and Gelderblom 2003; Miller 2003 Miller , 2004 . Electron microscopy allows the direct imaging in a sample of all particles down to a size of a fraction of a nanometre and hence the instant recognition of different morphological groups of pathogens (Hazelton and Gelderblom 2003; Curry et al. 2006) . The method provides basic information on the particulate composition of a sample and therefore gives a degree of direction and control for more precise techniques (e.g. nucleic acid amplification, immunological assays) that use specific probes to detect a pathogen but which can sometimes fail if the pathogen has mutated or if detection is impaired by inhibitors. Indeed, diagnostic electron microscopy can reveal and describe new versions of a pathogen and thereby facilitate their precise identification. The importance of this approach was clearly demonstrated by the collaborative identification of the pathogen causing SARS in which electron microscopy gave the first clue that a coronavirus was responsible (World Health Organisation 2003) .",

Samples, usually in the form of a suspension, are adsorbed onto the surface of a thin transparent plastic film supported by a metal grid, stained with heavy metals for stabilization and contrast (Miller 1986; Harris and Horne 1991) and then inspected using a transmission electron microscope. This whole procedure can be carried out within only a few minutes. Virus particles can usually be assigned to a particular virus family, while bacteria or fungi can only be recognized to a more general morphological group that provides direction for a more focused diagnosis (Gelderblom et al. 1991; Curry et al. 2006) . Most importantly, as well as being a valuable quick and simple diagnostic technique, there is a significant amount of reference data available in the literature concerning negative staining electron microscopy (Biel and Gelderblom 1999a) . However, despite having been used for many decades, quantitative data on the detection limits of the method are limited (Hammond et al. 1981; Biel and Gelderblom 1999a; Biel et al. 2004; Nitsche et al. 2007) .",

Four hundred mesh grids (Agar Scientific) coated with a formvar film and reinforced by a thick carbon layer were used as a support. All incubations were carried out using droplets (30 ll unless otherwise stated) on a sheet of parafilm. To increase the hydrophilicity and stickiness of the surface, grids were placed on a drop of alcian blue (Fluka, Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany; 1% in 1% acetic acid in water) for 10 min (Lang et al. 1981) . Grids were then washed over four droplets of double-distilled water, and the bulk of the water was removed from the grid surface using filter paper. The test suspension was brought into contact with the grid surface either by placing the grid, with the hydrophilic surface facing down, on a drop of the suspension (grid-on-drop procedure) or by adding 10 ll of the suspension to the hydrophilic surface of the grid (drop-on-grid procedure). After incubation for 10 min, grid surface was washed on four drops of double-distilled water for 5 s each. Excess water was removed from the grid surface using a filter paper, and the grid was placed on a drop of either 0AE5% uranyl acetate (spores) or 1% phosphotungstic acid at neutral pH (virus) for 5 s. Finally, grids were dried using a filter paper. To ensure that the forces applied to the adsorbed particles were reproducible, grids were held perpendicular to the surface of the filter paper for all such drying steps.",

The period between filling the tubes with the test suspension and commencing centrifugation was between 7 and 10 min (for six tubes). Centrifugation was carried out for 10 min at a pressure of 20 psi which corresponds to a centrifugal force of about 120 000 g (clearing factor is approx. 15; Beckman). These values were chosen based on a calculation of the time to fully sediment virus particles of the lowest known density [i.e. 100 Svedberg; Liebermann 1978; time (h) = clearing factor \u2044 density (Svedberg)]. After adaptors were removed from the centrifuge tubes, grids were released by inverting the adapters and adding 80 ll of double-distilled water to form a hanging drop.

To check the reliability of the detection limit, several control experiments were conducted in which suspensions at concentrations of 10 5 or 10 4 particles per ml were used for airfuge sedimentation onto grids. While detection of virus or spores was possible for all grids tested at 10 5 particles per ml (spores, n = 10 grids; virus, n = 6 grids), at the lower concentration of 10 4 particles per ml, some grids revealed no virus or spore particles in a systematical screening of 22 grid squares (five of six grids were positive for spores; four of six grids were positive for virus particles). Because the detection limit appears to be close to 10 4 particles per ml (Table 6 ) and because the likelihood of finding a particle at this concentration was high (but not 100%), an intermediate concentration of 5 \u00b7 10 4 particle per ml was tested. The resulting median particle number on the grids, together with a small interquartile range, imply successful detection of spores or virus on all grids treated with 5 \u00b7 10 4 particles per ml (corresponding to 4000 particles in the sample volume of 80 ll) using airfuge adsorption (Table 6 ). Testing grids (n = 11) with a virus suspension of 5 \u00b7 10 4 particles per ml supported this reliable detection while a similar test using spore suspension failed (2 of 11 grids were negative for spores).",

Our results demonstrate that negative staining of test suspensions of bacterial endospores or poxviruses is reproducible with regard to the number of particles detected on the grid. Alcian blue pretreatment of grids seems to be a reliable procedure because it did not add significantly to the variability of the results, possibly because the treatment is applied directly before adding the sample to the grid. Moreover, alcian blue solution can be stored for at least 6 months (at 2-10\u00b0C) without any significant loss of efficiency, reducing the risk of impaired reproducibility in practice. Pretreatment of grids by glow discharge is very popular because it renders them hydrophilic without adding any chemicals to the surface (Reissig and Orrell 1970) . However, the efficiency of binding particles to the surface is dependent on several factors of the discharge procedure (e.g. duration) and the time postdischarge (Harris 1997; Shibata and Miyazaki 2002) . It is still unclear what influence these parameters have on the detection of particles. Clearly, more experiments are needed to investigate the influence of different chemical or physical grid pretreatments on the efficiency of particle adsorption.",

Without airfuge sedimentation at least 10 6 particles per ml and applying the suspension onto the grid (drop-on-grid procedure) were necessary for reliable detection. With both poxviruses and spores, the application of a drop of the test suspension onto the grid was more efficient than placing the grid onto a drop of suspension (grid-on-drop procedure) indicating that particle density is high enough for a sufficient sedimentation by gravity. The detection limit determined here is in the range given by other studies using virus suspensions (Katz et al. 1984; Biel and Gelderblom 1999a; Johnsen et al. 2006 ). However, detection is not only influenced by the concentration of the relevant particles but also by the overall composition of the suspension. Constituents of a suspension can interfere with adhesion of the particles to the grid or can cover the particles (Kurth et al. 2008 ) thereby reducing the likelihood of detection. The detection limit proposed in this study should therefore be examined in further experiments using mixtures of test suspensions with environmental test samples (e.g. dust, soil, drying powder) and \u2044 or clinical test samples. Moreover, the detection limit for particles possessing a density lower than that of poxviruses should be determined. Experiments using clinical samples and particle estimations based on the measurement of genomic units suggest that the detection limit under these conditions may be higher (Biel et al. 2004; Nitsche et al. 2007) .",

The enrichment factor for poxviruses is similar to that given by other authors using the airfuge (M\u00fcller et al. 1981; Biel and Gelderblom 1999a) , although it is difficult to make direct comparisons because the airfuge parameters were not identical and, moreover, enrichment factors were not determined at the detection limit. Higher enrichment factors might be achieved using the particle counting EM-90 Beckman rotor (Hammond et al. 1981 ) although a direct comparison of the two rotor systems, including a critical evaluation of practical handiness, has yet to be published. Differences between the detection limit of spores and virus using airfuge enrichment may be explained by their different sizes and therefore, different susceptibilities to the mechanical forces exerted on the particles. Spores may be lost from the grid during manipulation after centrifugation, i.e. removal of the adaptor from the centrifugation tube and removal of the grid from the adaptor. Enhanced susceptibility of spores to mechanical forces is supported by the higher loss of spores (compared with virus) during washing. Several factors influence the detection limit of the negative staining method. In this study, we studied the impact of three factors: (i) procedure for applying the suspension (drop-on-grid versus grid-on-drop); (ii) incubation time and (iii) number of washing steps. In our hands, drop-on-grid always resulted in higher particle numbers than grid-on-drop. The difference between the two procedures was more pronounced with the spores than with the poxvirus test suspension, possibly because of the higher density of the spores. In this respect, it would be interesting to know at which particle density the drop-on grid procedure becomes less efficient than grid-on-drop for a given incubation time. Because both the sedimentation and the enrichment of particles at the interface between the liquid and air or the grid surface are time-dependent, it would be also helpful to know more about the kinetics of both processes.",

However, while with spores the particle adsorption followed a saturation kinetic during the 20-min observation time, with the virus an almost exponential increase in particle number was observed. This result can be explained by the different densities of the particles, leading to a faster sedimentation of spores than viruses. It is, however, remarkable that the virus suspension gave comparatively high particle numbers at short incubation times (i.e. 1 and 5 min). This difference may be because of a higher susceptibility of spores to removal from the grid by washing. As the detection limit is dependent on incubation time, a compromise between sensitivity and overall processing time must be found for each experiment or diagnostic test. Based on our experiments, a slight increase in the sensitivity of detection (i.e. by a factor of 1AE4 for spores and 2AE4 for virus) is likely if the incubation time is increased to 20 min.",

We showed a significant loss of particles only after two washing steps and after four washing steps (the standard used in this study) the loss was about 40% for spores and about 30% for virus particles. This difference may be related to the larger size of spores, making them more prone to removal than the smaller virus particles. Washing should therefore be reduced to a minimum to avoid a reduction in detection sensitivity and further testing should establish an optimal compromise between the visibility of particles and their retention on the grid.",

However, in practice, observation time is limited by the situation, especially on the time available for a diagnosis. Screening 20 grid squares systematically distributed over the grid already takes approx. 10-15 min depending on various parameters such as staining quality, particle number, size and distribution. A possible moderate gain in detection sensitivity should therefore be carefully weighed against the loss in detection speed. Moreover, while scanning across the grid in a more or less even sampling pattern, it is possible to concentrate on certain regions of the grid that show an interesting particle distribution. Open view negative staining electron microscopy may therefore find particles that are present at a low number on the grid, somewhat lowering the detection limit in practice. However, diagnostic quality is also dependent on the competence of the electron microscopist and overall diagnostic performance must therefore be regularly evaluated by blinded testing and maintained or improved by continuous practice (Biel and Gelderblom 1999a) .",

It therefore serves as an independent control for other methods applied in parallel to identify possible bioterrorism-related pathogens. Our experiments demonstrate that bacterial endospores and poxviruses, two candidate pathogens for bioterrorism, can be reliably detected up to a defined detection limit under ideal conditions, even if they are modified by inactivating chemicals.
