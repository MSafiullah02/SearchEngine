It happens mostly during adulthood, with a tendency to recurrent relapses. Often, no associated clinical condition is found, but in half of the cases, TTP is diagnosed after bacterial or viral infections, autoimmune diseases or in association with drugs.",

All are currently used and have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy and safety in TTP patients. Although the level of ADAMTS-13, after MB/light treatment, is normal [12] and similar to other pathogen-reduced plasmas or QP [[13], [14], [15]], the use of MB remains controversial, as some authors suggest it is less effective in terms of the volume of plasma required, than QP, in TTP patients [[16], [17], [18]], arguing that more TPE sessions and a larger amount of MB-Plasma, are required to achieve TTP remission.",

THERAFLEX MB-Plasma system uses a photosensitive agent (MB) and visible light at 630 nm, to intercalate into the RNA/DNA backbone of the pathogen\u2018s genome. Many of the biological effects of MB are closely associated with its unique physicochemical properties, including its redox characteristics, ionic charges, and light spectrum characteristics. As a photosensitiser, MB can have two different mechanisms of action. Excitation by light can induce singlet and triplet stages of the molecule and transfer the energy through either electrons (Type I mechanism) or energy (Type II mechanism). The Type I mechanism can lead to the formation of hydroxyl radicals and lipid hydroperoxides. The Type II mechanism proceeds through singlet oxygen resulting mainly in breakages of nucleic acids, mostly at the guanosine site, leading to oxidation and destruction of the viral nucleic acid strand breakages preventing viral replication [20]. Especially, lipid peroxidation induced by MB photosensitization has detrimental effects on membrane integrity, leading to a loss of fluidity and alterations on the functions of several ion channels, receptors, and transporters.",

The study design is unbalanced (QP group, n = 13; MBP group, n = 7) and collected during different periods (6 years, for the QP group and less than 3 years, for the MBP group). This kind of design has low statistical power and also reduces the likelihood that a statistically significant result reflects a true effect [30]. Besides, the TTP-related deaths happened between 5 and 8 days after diagnosis, in the QP group and 35 days, in the MBP group. Therefore, the QP group received fewer plasma units, during fewer episodes, and the hospitalisation time was much shorter. In small samples, extreme values may lead to a bias. However, results from the study did not reach statistical significance for the comparison of the number of TPE processes and duration of hospitalisation (p = 0.076 and p = 0.074, respectively), when removing from the analysis the three patients who died. Further, the complete remission rates (69.2 % and 57.1 %, in QP and MBP, respectively) were not significantly different (p = 0.651).",

Within-subject serial dependence between episodes, recurrence, and mortality will result, with this method, misleading the interpretation of the data analysis.

The study approach is based on episodes only, but the analysis equates episodes and patients, a potential cause of misleading results. The age, gender, remission, and mortality rates, we assessed considering the episodes, instead of patients, which is not coherent. Remission was defined as a response that eventually lasted for longer than 30 days after the withdrawal of TPE therapy, which is inconsistent with the primary endpoint. It is not clear the rationale of this definition, and no evidence-based explanation was given. Besides, no homogeneity analysis was carried out between centres, and the Mann-Whitney test used is not meaningful, given that the sample size was large enough in both TPE groups to use a parametric test [32].",

Even in those situations, splitting the data brings misleading results and confusions in the analysis of the results of a study. Likewise, the estimation of the logistic model requires basic assumptions to be met for logistic regression, including independence of errors, linearity in the logit for continuous variables, the absence of multicollinearity, and lack of strongly influential outliers [34,35], which are not mentioned in this prospective study. Besides, the resulting logistic regression model assessment using a goodness-of-fit measure is not shown. Before reaching definitive conclusions, the model's internal validity should formally quantify (i.e., replicability within the same data set) and external validity (i.e., generalizability beyond the current sample), which is not commented in their analysis. No survival analysis was found to evaluate the evolution of the patients. Eventually, remission was achieved in 97 % and 95 % episodes with MBP and QP, respectively.

Some authors suggest the reduced risk of AE of MBP compared to QP, markedly in allergic reactions cases [[41], [42], [43], [44]]. Thus, pathogen inactivated plasmas have been associated with fewer allergic reactions, febrile non-haemolytic reactions, transfusion circulatory overload (TACO) and hypotensive reactions than untreated plasma [45]. We have not found a physiopathological base for QP to be associated with a higher death rate, and this probably can only be ascertained by proteomic or metabolomic studies.
