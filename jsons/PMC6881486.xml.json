However, PJP is being increasingly diagnosed in HIV-negative patients, in whom it carries a poorer prognosis [7, 8]. A higher proportion of neutrophils in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid during PJP was associated with higher risks of respiratory complications and mortality [9, 10]. In the same way, a low lymphocyte count in BAL fluid was a risk factor for the failure of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) therapy [11]. Early adjunctive steroid therapy for severe PJP dramatically decreased mortality rates in HIV-positive patients [12, 13] but had variable effects in their HIV-negative counterparts [14\u201316]. These findings suggest that the immunological status and underlying diagnosis may influence the pathophysiology of PJP and the risk of mortality [17, 18]. However, BAL fluid cytology profiles have not been adequately evaluated as potential prognostic factor and predictors of treatment responses.",

From January 2012 to January 2017, all patients presenting an invasive fungal infection that has been diagnosed in our center have been included in a prospective registry (the French prospective surveillance programme, RESSIF network), thus PJP patients have been included in a sub-cohort. For each patient with a positive sample, the following clinical findings were prospectively investigated: dyspnea and/or cough in immunocompromised patients with interstitial syndrome by radiography or CT scan. Among all respiratory samples investigated for 6 years (n = 2446), all positive tests for Pneumocystis jirovecii samples (n = 430) were assessed by a biologist and a clinician to investigate criteria for PJP and include them in this prospective cohort. The following data were prospectively collected: age; sex; underlying disease; PJP prophylaxis; other medications including glucocorticoids taken during the past month; type of symptoms and symptom duration at PJP diagnosis and time from symptom onset to hospital admission. Secondary, the clinical data were collected for all patients from medical records: laboratory findings (white blood cell count; absolute neutrophil count; C-reactive protein [CRP] level; BAL fluid findings including the cell profile assessed by an independent cytologist on centrifuged BAL fluid samples prepared with the Wright-Giemsa and Perls stains to allow the determination of macrophage, lymphocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil, and basophil counts); presence of P. jirovecii and/or other fungi and/or bacteria and/or viruses (influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus) were recorded at PJP diagnosis. The SOFA score on day 1 and the ratio of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen over the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) on day 1 [19] were recorded for each patient at PJP diagnosis. Anti-PJP medications, adjuvant glucocorticoid therapy, oxygen supplementation, and ventilatory support provided at admission were documented. Finally, patient outcomes including 90-day mortality were recorded. The collection of follow-up data ended in December 2017.",

Lymphocytic alveolitis [21] was defined as a BAL fluid cell population containing more than 10% of lymphocytes and more than 5% of neutrophils combined with an activated macrophage phenotype, based on the diagnostic criteria for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, a condition characterised by alveolitis and migration to the alveoli of multiple cell types including activated T cells, monocytes, and natural killer cells [22].

Factors associated with all-cause 90-day mortality were identified by logistic regression analysis of patients alive after day 90 versus patients who died before day 90. Only factors reaching statistical significance (p < 0.05), with no more than 10% missing data, were included in the multivariate model. When collinearity between co-variates was detected, only the variable with the highest OR was kept into the multivariate regression model. Results are reported as log-transformed coefficients with their 95% CIs. Missing data were not interpolated. Analyses were performed on the whole population, then excluding HIV+ patients.",

The reduced severity of PJP in HIV-positive patients is more likely to be associated with the particularity of HIV-induced immunosuppression, of which pneumocystis is a hallmark of a severe adaptive cellular impairment. The co-morbidities in non-HIV patients (onco-hematology, solid organ transplantation and system diseases) may also contribute to their greater vulnerability. The immune recovery allowed by the initiation of antiretroviral therapy is probably correlated with better long-term outcomes in HIV-positive patients than in non-HIV patients whose profound immunosuppression is more frequently extended. HIV-positive patients also have lower neutrophil counts in BAL fluid samples [28], are less likely to develop severe PJP, and have lower mortality rates compared to HIV-negative patients [11, 26\u201329].

Our study suggests that future prospective studies on adjunctive treatments for PJP should focus on HIV-negative patients, notably solid organ and haematological stem cell transplant recipients, meeting criteria for severe PJP (e.g., SOFA score > 2 with a low PaO2/FiO2 ratio).

The quickSOFA, which is a simplified score based on three criteria, is easy to determine by non-intensivists and may be useful for determining when advice from an intensivist should be sought [31]. In addition to a worse SOFA score, viral co-infection at the time of PJP diagnosis was associated with higher 90-day mortality. Viral infections consisted mostly (67%) in reactivation of latent viruses (cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, or Epstein-Barr virus), suggesting that this subgroup may have been characterised by a more profound immune deficiency.

Three patient subgroups can be identified in our population, one defined by alveolitis, the other one PJP occuring in HIV-positive individuals, both having a better prognosis and the last one defined by a SOFA score above 2 on admission who have a more severe prognosis.

In murine models of CD4+ T-cell depleted mice, increased alveolar recruitment of CD8+ T cells induced by interleukin-7 therapy improved P. jirovecii clearance [34]. Lymphocyte count in BAL fluid is increased in patients with alveolitis, which was associated with a better prognosis in our study. Thus, alveolitis during PJP might reflect maintenance of an effective pulmonary immune response including CD8+ T-cell recruitment.

These findings confirm earlier results [16, 35] and further identify the absence of TMP/SMZ prophylaxis as a major risk factor for PJP in high-risk patients [29]. Providing appropriate prophylactic anti-microbial treatments to patients with immunosuppression, notably related to haematological diseases and transplantation, is crucial to improve patient outcomes. Adherence to prophylactic treatment must be supported at each follow-up visit. PJP usually develops in patients with CD4+counts below 300/mm3 [36\u201338], although the depth of lymphopenia does not correlate with PJP severity [39, 40]. A history of glucocorticoid exposure is an often reported risk factor for PJP in HIV-negative patients [41, 42]. Among our patients, over half were receiving glucocorticoid therapy at the diagnosis of PJP, in a mean prednisone-equivalent dosage of 20 mg/day. Adjuvant glucocorticoid therapy was given to most severe patients who failed antibiotic treatment alone. Given the history of glucocorticoid exposure, the effects of adjuvant glucocorticoid therapy were difficult to assess. The role for adjuvant glucocorticoid therapy in patients with PJP is debated [26, 43\u201347] and is currently being assessed in a prospective study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02944045).",

The European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia-5 group has defined severe PJP, like those defined for HIV-positive patients [49] such as PaO2 less than 8 kPa, oxygen saturation less than 91%, and radiological impairment. These criteria were only used in retrospective study of PJP patients [45]. However, these criteria have not been prospectively validated in non-HIV patients. HIV-patients less often experienced severe PJP compared to their HIV-negative counterparts, enhancing the need to propose an early severity scale adapted to this specific population. We, therefore, relied on criteria indicating hypoxemic ARF, namely, FiO2 \u2265 50% or NIV or MV. The strong association of severe PJP with higher 90-day mortality indicates that our definition successfully identified severe PJP.",
