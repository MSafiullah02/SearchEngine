In order to create short term predictions to prepare for the extent of the global pandemic we analyze infection data from the top 25 affected countries. It is shown that all country-specific infection rates follow a power law growth behavior and the scaling exponents per country are calculated. We find two different growth patterns: either steady power law growth from the very beginning with moderate scaling exponents of 3-5 or explosive power law growth with dramatic scaling exponents of 8-11. In the case of the USA we even find an exponent of 16.59. By means of data analysis we confirm that instituting strict measures of lock-downs combined with a strong adherence by the population are effective means to bring the growth rates down. While many countries have instituted measures there are only three countries (Denmark, Norway, and South Korea) so far where such lock-downs led to a significant reduction of the growth rate. In the case of Denmark we calculate the reduction of the scaling exponents to move from 6.82 to 1.47.",

As of March 25th 10:30 CET 424,048 people in over 170 countries and regions have been infected [1] . Due to its high infectivity no slowing down of the spread is currently in sight. A medical cure or vaccine is not available yet. This pandemic brings health care systems worldwide to their limits. The mortality rate is calculated to be 2.5% [2] (comparison: SARS 9.6% [3] and H1N1 influence 0.6% [4] ). As the number of infections rises many governments around the world have instituted drastic lock-downs and curfews and called for social distancing and work from home to reduce the rate at which the virus spreads.",

Therefore such models tend to overestimate the number of infected people as time progresses, simply because there are no more new people to infect in the individuals particular group. On the other hand if the disease were to spread only at the periphery of a compact region of infections then a parabolic growth t 2 would be expected [16] . It is thus to be assumed that after an initial short exponential growth a slow down should be observed where the growth of newly infected people increases less than exponentially but probably faster than t 2 as humans are not generally limited to the confines of a compact region. Given what is known about human interactions and structures mostly showing small world phenomena and scale free networks [17, 18] the assumption of a power law behavior is reasonable. Early analysis in February 2020 [19] showed this indeed to be true. After a short initial exponential growth period the number of infections, as well as the number of recovered and de-ceased patients follows a power law:",
