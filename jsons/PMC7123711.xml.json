            "text": "During transformation, the cells change their form: they lose their normal epithelioid or fibroblast-like character and adopt mainly a spherical form. The transformation-associated change of the cytoskeleton is responsible for this effect, and confers on the eukaryotic cells their shape and is involved in cell division, cell motility and cell polarity. The breakdown of intracellular microfilaments is a prevailing process. In non-muscle cells, these microfilaments consist of the globular components \u03b2-actin and \u03b3-actin, which are usually organized in long cables with a diameter of 7 nm and are cross-linked by the protein fimbrin. Actin cables form network structures beneath the cytoplasmic membrane, stabilize the shape of the cell and are also involved in the correct positioning of membrane proteins, where they are associated with other proteins such as myosin and tropomyosin, which tense the actin filaments. They are responsible for the short intracellular transport, for example, of vesicles to the plasma membrane. At the sites of the cytoplasmic membrane where the cables end, the cells form contacts with neighbouring cells, or are rooted in the surface of the base (in vitro, on the bottom of the cell culture flask). These regions are referred to as focal contacts. In the cells, there is a dynamic equilibrium of monomeric and polymeric actin. In the presence of Mg2+ and K+ ions and under ATP binding, globular actin monomers associate to filaments that are stabilized with the polypeptides \u03b1-actinin, filamin and fimbrin. During transformation, the cable-like arrangement of filaments is lost, and the actin monomers are diffusely distributed over the entire cell. This facilitates cell motility, which is necessary for tumour formation. Binding of the protein components profilin, gelsolin, vinculin and vilin has a destabilizing effect on the polymerization degree; the actin-bound ATP is hydrolysed during this process. It is unclear what regulates the changes of microfilaments at the molecular level. It is believed that increased phosphorylation of actin and vinculin is involved as it occurs in transformed cells.",

            "text": "Simultaneously with the alteration of actin filaments, a redistribution of transmembrane proteins is observed on the surfaces of transformed cells. They are connected with actin cables at the inner side of the cytoplasmic membrane and lose their position in defined groups, as a result of the collapse of actin cables. This changes, among other things, the concentration of integrins and their distribution. Integrins are membrane-anchored proteins which are connected to the actin cables by their cytoplasmic moiety. Their extracellular domains are associated with fibronectin, which in turn interacts with collagen and laminin. They make up the extracellular matrix, which mediates the interactions between different cells and is responsible for their organization and growth in cell aggregates; it ensures that cells grow as a monolayer in vitro and facilitates adhesion to the base, e.g., the cell culture dish. Owing to their low levels of integrins, transformed cells have significantly lower amounts of fibronectin on their surface and grow in cell clusters (foci). The concentrations of various ions, sugars and amino acid transporting proteins are increased on the surfaces of transformed cells. This is associated with up to tenfold increased metabolic activity in comparison with normal cells. The concentration of other membrane proteins is also altered: for example, the levels of MHC class I proteins are usually reduced, whereas the levels of proteinases (metalloproteases, cysteine and serine proteases) and collagenases (type IV collagenases, transin/stromelin) are elevated on the cell surface. These proteins are also released into the surrounding region, which augments the potential of transformed cells to invade lymphatic vessels and capillaries and the formation of metastases. As a prerequisite for metastasis, primary tumour cells have to leave the tumour to overcome the basement membrane and to penetrate into the local stroma, e.g., in metastasis of cervical carcinoma that is induced by papillomaviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). To find access to the circulatory system, to immigrate as a secondary colony into the new target organ and to proliferate there, tumour cells must induce angiogenesis, i.e. the de novo generation of blood vessels that supply the tumour with blood and all the nutrients contained therein.",

            "text": "In vitro transformed cells differ from normal cells in regard to their growth behaviour. Fibroblasts or epithelial cells which are placed in a cell culture bottle commonly attach to the plastic or glass surface. Subsequently, they divide continuously until a confluent monolayer is formed and the cells have used the entire available area completely. Then, cell division stops. In contrast to normal cells, transformed cells grow in multilayered, three-dimensional aggregates and reach cell concentrations that are five to ten times higher (foci). They are not subject to the so-called contact inhibition. If they are further cultivated in the culture bottle, an equilibrium is established between death of a subset of the cells and continuous division of the remaining subpopulation. Transformed cells grow in culture regardless of contact with plastic or glass surfaces, which is usually necessary for the proliferation of fibroblasts or epithelial cells. This property is an important feature of transformed cells. Therefore, some of these cells may also grow into larger aggregates, so-called cell clones, in a semiliquid medium such as soft agar. The ability to growth in soft agar correlates very well with the ability of transformed cells to form tumours in animal test systems. This behaviour is presumably based on the higher levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, which is synthesized in such cells. TGF-\u03b2 is a growth factor that stimulates, inter alia, the synthesis of fibronectin and collagen (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_8). The cells are thus provided with a locally limited extracellular matrix, which enables them to adhere together and to grow in grape-like aggregates.",

For this reason, the medium is supplemented with approximately 10\u201315 % fetal calf serum, which ensures that all essential components are available. Important for cell proliferation are primarily epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, various fibroblast growth factors and some hormones. These factors bind to their respective receptors on the cell surface and induce the activation of protein kinases by different signal transduction pathways, which in a tightly regulated, cascade-like process phosphorylate various cellular proteins, including transactivators. Transactivators bind to the serum response elements in the promoter region of growth-factor-dependent genes and induce their expression. The newly formed gene products initiate cell division. By contrast, transformed cells divide independently of the presence of growth factors in the culture medium. They are able to grow in media containing no or very little serum. Transformed cells produce many of the necessary factors themselves, thus stimulating their autocrine proliferation. Moreover, they often secrete tumour growth factors (TGF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2), which also stimulate autocrine cell growth (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_8). In some transformed cells, the growth factor receptors are altered in such a way that they stimulate an active state even in the absence of the respective factor, incessantly transmitting signals into the cell.",

Latent Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) transactivates the promoters, which control the expression of latent viral genes. In addition, EBNA2 induces the synthesis of various cellular proteins, including that of CD23. Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), another viral polypeptide that is synthesized during latency, is also able to do so. The CD23 protein is found in two versions: the membrane-bound CD23 is a low-affinity IgE receptor; on the other hand, the secreted form of the protein serves as B-cell growth factor and promotes proliferation of infected B lymphocytes. The Epstein\u2013Barr-virus-specific LMP1 gene product has also a number of other functions that are essential for transformation of latently infected cells. There is evidence that this envelope protein acts similarly to some of the classic oncogenes of retroviruses, and is a constitutively active growth factor receptor, which continuously triggers and maintains a signalling cascade. Apparently, it is similar to members of the nerve growth factor receptor family, which includes the TNF receptor. They constantly transmit signals into the infected cells, resulting in induction of the expression of NF\u03baB-dependent genes, among other things. As a result, apoptosis is inhibited, and increased concentrations of adhesion molecules, transferrin receptor, and CD23 proteins are induced.",

The central DNA-binding core domain consists of a variety of structural motifs that are evolutionarily conserved; this important region is responsible for the sequence-specific DNA-binding activity and the correct folding of p53, thus essentially contributing to its tumour-suppressor activity, as demonstrated by the fact that it is the target of more than 90 % of p53 mutations found in human cancers. The carboxy-terminal region contains several functional motifs, including the tetramerization domain, three nuclear localization signals, which flank the oligomerization domain, a single putative nuclear export signal located within the tetramerization domain and a basic negative regulatory domain.",

This induces the synthesis of proteins, which arrest the cell in the G1 phase and delay the transition to the S phase. For example, the protein p21 is strongly induced, and interacts with the CDK2 and CDK4, and inhibits them. CDK2 and CDK4 have the function to phosphorylate various proteins, such as RB105. If RB105 is not phosphorylated, it remains associated with the E2F and DP1 transcription factors, which thus cannot exert their transactivation functions. This prevents the cell from entering the S phase of the cell cycle and provides more time to repair DNA damage (Fig. 6.1). If DNA repair is not successful, p53 induces apoptosis in eukaryotic cells (programmed cell death), and thus also prevents tumour formation. To a certain degree, the function of p53 is comparable to the SOS response, which is induced under similar DNA-damaging conditions in bacteria. This regulatory mechanism delays replication of the bacterial chromosome, so more time is available for the repair systems to correct the DNA damage before it can be manifested as mutations in DNA daughter molecules after subsequent replication rounds.",

Mutations in only one allele of the p53 gene are usually sufficient since wild-type and mutant proteins form inactive heterotetramers. In cells carrying p53 gene mutations, further mutations occur in the entire genome because of the impaired activity of p53, and these additionally contribute to malignant transformation in a multistep process. Viruses have developed diverse mechanisms to inactivate the cell-cycle-regulating effect of p53, and to create conditions that are necessary for their own reproduction. The T antigen of SV40 (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19), the 55-kDa E1B protein of adenoviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19) and the X protein of hepatitis B virus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19) bind to p53 and prevent the formation of functionally active tetramers.

            "text": "The retinoblastoma gene was first described in children with eye cancer. In these patients, both alleles of a gene are defective; the gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 13 and encodes a protein with a molecular mass of about 105 kDa (RB105). Later, mutated forms of this protein were also detected in osteosarcomas, soft tissue sarcomas and in breast, lung and bladder cancers. Phosphorylation of RB105 and the similar protein RB107 depends on the phase of the cell cycle. The aforementioned CDK2 and CDK4 are responsible for the phosphorylation of these proteins (Fig. 6.1). They are active, i.e. proliferation-inhibiting, in their dephosphorylated state. In this form, they bind to transcription factors E2F and DP1, which as free proteins interact with DNA elements in the promoters of specific genes in a sequence-specific fashion; such genes include the genes encoding the cellular enzymes thymidine kinase, dihydrofolate reductase, DNA polymerase-\u03b1 and CDK2. All these proteins are required during the S phase of the cell cycle. The transactivation functions of transcription factors E2F and DP1 are inhibited in association with RB105. Therefore, the entry of cells into the S phase is blocked. If retinoblastoma proteins are phosphorylated, the complex with the transcription factors is dissolved. The latter can bind to the corresponding promoters and induce the expression of the genes that they regulate. Viruses that exclusively replicate in proliferating cells possess factors which influence the functions of retinoblastoma proteins. The papillomavirus E7 protein, the T antigen of SV40, the hepatitis C virus NS5B protein, and the E1A proteins of adenoviruses bind to RB105/RB107. These interactions abolish the complex formation with transcription factors E2F and DP1, which in turn become activated, and exert their transactivation activities (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19\u201310.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19).",

Cells infected with adenoviruses or Epstein\u2013Barr virus can elude the antiviral effect of interferon by synthesis of adenovirus-encoded virus-associated RNA molecules or Epstein\u2013Barr-virus-encoded RNA molecules, respectively. Both virus types also reduce the concentration of MHC class I proteins on the cell surface.

Although little is known about these processes, there is a growing body of evidence that transformation and tumour formation can solely be successful if viruses induce not only cell proliferation and have mechanisms to evade the immune system, but also prevent the induction of apoptosis. These processes are best studied in Epstein\u2013Barr virus, which has complex mechanisms for immortalization and transformation. The latent protein LMP1 induces the expression of the cellular proto-oncogene c-bcl-2 (Fig. 6.1), which in turn prevents the cell triggering apoptosis by inducing the Fas signalling pathway. The same effect is exerted by the adenovirus 19-kDa E1B protein and a protein of Epstein\u2013Barr virus which is encoded in the BHRF1 open reading frame ORF. They have sequence and functional homology to the protein Bcl2 and also counteract the induction of apoptosis (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19).
