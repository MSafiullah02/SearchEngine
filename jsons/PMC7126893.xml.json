The family Caliciviridae is classified into four genera: Norovirus (NoV), Sapovirus (SaV), Vesivirus and Lagovirus (Green et al., 2000) with a new proposed genus, Nebraska (NB)-like (Smiley et al., 2002). Caliciviruses have been identified in a number of animal species in association with respiratory, vesicular and hemorrhagic and enteric diseases. In humans, NoVs and SaVs have been associated with enteric diseases only, and are the most common cause of food- and waterborne, acute, non-bacterial gastroenteritis in humans worldwide (Green et al., 2001). Animal SaVs and NoVs also cause gastroenteritis in swine, calves and mink (Bridger, 1990, Guo et al., 2001, Saif et al., 1980).",

Electron microscopy, animal cross-protection experiments and solid-phase immune electron microscopy (Bridger et al., 1984, Dastjerdi et al., 1999, Woode and Bridger, 1978) revealed NA1 to be unrelated to the bovine enteric calicivirus, Newbury agent-2, which is the prototype BNoV. Genomic data were recently obtained from two virus strains, Bo/Nebraska/80/US and Bo/Newbury1/76/UK (Oliver et al., 2006, Smiley et al., 2002). Smiley et al. (2002) reported that the NB-like bovine enteric calicivirus is genetically most similar to SaVs and lagoviruses, and causes pathology in the small intestine of gnotobiotic calves. Oliver et al. (2006) showed that NB and NA1 viruses form a distinct clade that is independent of the 4 recognized genera. The evidence for classifying the NA1 and NB viruses into the same genus was their identical genome organization, identical composition and location of predicted ORF1 protease cleavage sites as well as the almost identical capsid proteins (Oliver et al., 2006). Until now, this potentially new genus, including NB- and NA1-like unclassified bovine enteric caliciviruses (BECs), has not been named by the International Committee on Viral Taxonomy. In this study, therefore, we use the name of these viruses as \u201cunclassified BECs\u201d with \u201cNB- and NA1-like viruses\u201d to designate the strains.",

Therefore, molecular studies have relied upon the availability of stool samples collected during outbreaks or from human volunteers and experimental animal studies. Similar to the genomes of lagoviruses and SaVs, unclassified BECs have two predicted open reading frames (ORFs) that encode non-structural and contiguous capsid proteins (ORF1), as well as a basic protein that is characteristic of the family Caliciviridae (Oliver et al., 2006, Smiley et al., 2002). The NA1 and NB viruses can be assigned into two separate genotypes, based on the genetic divergence in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene (Oliver et al., 2006).",

The paired comparisons of these viruses revealed the nt and aa sequences of the Korean viruses RdRp gene to be more homologous to each other (96.4\u2013100% nt and 95.3\u2013100% aa) and more closely related to the NB-like viruses (80.9\u201388.1% nt and 84.5\u201398.4% aa) than to the NA1-like viruses (75.8\u201378.4% nt and 79.7\u201382.8% aa) (Table 2\n). Phylogenetic analysis of the nt sequences of the partial RdRp gene from the unclassified BECs also revealed the 16 Korean RdRp gene to cluster together and closely in a branch with the NB-like strains, particularly with the PenrithC39 and Starcross93 strains (Fig. 1\n). The NA1-like viruses including the NA1, Penrith142, Starcross117, Penrith151, Penrith143 and Penrith150 strains clustered on a separate major branch (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the Korean BECs are closely related to NB-like but distantly related to the NA1-like viruses. A previous study reported that unclassified BECs can be divided into two potential genotypes, NA1-like and NB-like, according to phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp gene (Oliver et al., 2006). It was reported that both genotypes are circulating in the UK but the US has only NB-like viruses (Oliver et al., 2006). The genetic similarity of the Korean BECs to NB-like viruses from the US can be explained by the fact that from the 1960s, South Korea imports live cows mainly from countries in North American and Oceania, not from European countries. However, the possibility of NA1-like virus infections in South Korea, even with a very low infection status, cannot be excluded. Therefore, continuous monitoring and intensive study of the BECs with a larger number of bovine fecal samples will be needed.",

In addition, the Korean BECs in the phylogenetic analysis of the RdRp and capsid genes clustered together, and the other known BECs clustered on a separate branch. In contrast to genotyping by the RdRp gene, it was reported that there are no capsid genotypes (Oliver et al., 2006). Therefore, this data can support the above suggestion (Oliver et al., 2006) and suggests that the Korean BECs may have a distinct evolutionary pathway from the NB- and NA1-like BECs.",
