Events such as the 11 September attacks on the World Trade Centre in 2001, the Bali bomb attack in 2002 and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 have had a dramatic impact on organisations in the tourism and hospitality industry (Ritchie, 2004). The 11 September attacks led to a sharp decline in worldwide commercial passenger traffic and contributed to the bankruptcy of United Airlines, US Airways, Hawaiian Airlines and National Airlines (Kim & Gu, 2004). Washington's hotel industry experienced a strong decline in room sales due to the closure of Reagan National Airport following the 2001 terrorist attacks (Stafford, Yu, & Armoo, 2002). Similarly, the SARS outbreak dealt a severe blow to many organisations in the Asian tourism industry. Taiwan, coping with the third largest SARS outbreak, had a 50 percent decrease in overseas visitors reducing hotel room occupancy by 40 percent (Min, 2005) while the life, work and travelling behaviour of Chinese domestic tourists was greatly affected by SARS (Wen, Huimin, & Kavanaugh, 2005).",

An understanding of this issue is important, as it will help to explain organisational responses to different types of strategic issues, supporting a contingency approach to strategic decision-making (Dutton, 1986). It will also contribute towards a better understanding of strategy development, as it is the patterning of strategic issue responses over time that underlies the strategy formulation process (Mintzberg, 1978). Finally, this paper will assist managers to develop strategies and policies to better manage and cope with the impact of shock events in the future.",

This definition highlights three important aspects of a crisis. First, a crisis is a major, unpredictable event that is likely to interfere with normal business operations and has the potential to threaten organisational survival (Pearson, Misra, Clair, & Mitroff, 1997). Second, a crisis has a low probability of occurring and includes an element of surprise. Finally, a crisis is characterised by time pressures, requiring a quick response in order to minimise its impact.",

To preserve anonymity, we call this airport FlyRight. All Australian airports are now owned or controlled by private lessee companies and consortiums or local governments (Kain & Webb, 2003). Following privatization in 1998 airport pricing was regulated, effectively capping prices for aeronautical services for 5 years (1998\u20132002) at rates equivalent to the pricing structure prior to deregulation. Given the nature of the price cap, Australian airport operator charges fell in real terms between 1997 and 2001 (Kain & Webb, 2003).",

Prior to its collapse Ansett held a 39 percent market share (Ibisworld, 2001). According to the Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics (2004), the Ansett collapse, together with the 11 September attacks, created a climate of uncertainty in the aviation industry. By October, normally the busiest month for the Australian airlines, passenger numbers had fallen to 2.4 million, which represented a reduction of 20.8 percent compared to July 2001. Revenue passenger kilometres fell to 2.5 billion, a reduction of 21.2 percent and the number of flights decreased below 40,000, down 22.6 percent compared to July 2001 (Bureau of Transport & Regional Economics, 2004). At the time of the Ansett collapse a little over 12 million seats were available in Australia annually, a level that was only recovered in May 2004, more than 32 months later (Tourism Australia, 2005).",

According to the Managing Director, Ansett represented about 40 percent of FlyRight's revenue and had a long-term lease on about half of the terminal building. Hence, the demise of Ansett threatened the survival of FlyRight and required immediate action. The General Manager Aviation describes FlyRight's decision process following Ansett's demise as follows: Prior to the shock event we were an organisation whose revenue was based on landed tonnes. We lost 40 percent of our revenue overnight following the demise of Ansett through reduced landing fees and terminal lease fees. That crystallized in our own minds, something that we had been working through, prior to the demise of Ansett. In the face of increasing competition from airports in close geographic proximity FlyRight had been considering how to change the revenue base to move away from landed tonnes towards a passenger service charge. Ansett's demise allowed FlyRight to demonstrate to the regulatory authorities that if we did nothing we would be bankrupt.This change enabled us to move away from an ever-diminishing revenue stream, because airlines were putting more and more passengers on fewer and fewer aircraft, to a situation whereby we were charging the airlines per passenger. The airlines embraced this revenue structure because they could charge the fee as a straight airport tax, which was perceived as a fee that was beyond the airlines control. \u2026 Following the changed revenue base FlyRight went from a marginal corporation to becoming a very profitable organisation with a revenue increase of 170 percent.\n",

As the General Manager Finance and Administration explained: \u201cWe had been talking to the regulators before, a long time before Ansett, about a change in the pricing regime. When Ansett came along that gave us the means by which to push it through quickly, because without that change in the pricing regime we would not be here today. It had to change quickly because of the shock event\u201d. On 13 May 2002, the Australian Government announced that the pricing regimes at Australian airports were to be liberalised and subjected only to price monitoring (rather than price capping) by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for 5 years from 1 July 2002, allowing all Australian airport operators to seek growth in profits (Kain & Webb, 2003).",

This finding is in line with research by Khatri and Ng (2000) who found that the use of intuition was positively associated with organisational performance in an unstable environment, but was negatively correlated with performance in a stable environment. Intuition, however, requires \u201cintimate knowledge of the subject in question\u201d (Mintzberg, 1994, p. 325) which may take years to develop, whereas analysis is available whenever \u201cclever analysts can get their hands on good hard data\u201d (Mintzberg, 1994, p. 325). Hence, in addition to establishing proactive scanning and planning procedures, organisations need to develop an organisational culture that fosters intuition, flexibility and strategic thinking over a long period of time. Clark and Harman (2004) support this point by arguing that \u201ccrisis management is not about researching and planning contingencies for every possible crisis that might occur, but rather about developing the capability within the organization to react flexibly and to make the right snap decisions that will be required when a crisis does happen\u201d (p. 40).",
