Surveillance tools must generate ongoing, real-time information, which is why long-term and unpredictable risk factors (discussed below) often remain the subject of research journals and do not permeate into national and international EOCs. An integrated, remote-sensing based platform to provide early warning of EID events could ameliorate the distance between long-term trends and real-time risk.",

The field of epidemiology is intimately linked with spatial analysis since its genesis: in 1854, as cholera decimated the Soho district of London, a physician by the name of John Snow famously began tracking the cases as they emerged on a map of the city (Fig. 1\n) [8]. Geographic clusters of individual cases quickly emerged along unique corridors of the city's streets. This methodology yielded a critical insight: the clusters occurred along shared routes of water distribution [8]. The geospatial patterns, which existed neither in the lab nor in the isolated clinical context, extended the Cartesian relationship of disease transmission into another dimension. Patterns portend predictability, which offers public health officials an opportunity to intervene.",

It is critical to note that such an extrapolation would be beyond the state of what the current data support. For example, associations between ecological change and the propagation of malaria have been shown to be inconsistent, and in some cases biodiversity seems to be associated with increases in human infection rates [20]. Importantly, this example is of an endemic or established pathogen, the ecology of which no longer behaves in accordance with the body of evidence presented here. The need to distinguish between these two distinct states of infectious agents in the context of ecological change is discussed in depth by Hosseini et al. [22], who suggest that the differences between the terms \u201chazard\u201d and \u201crisk\u201d may play a role in misunderstandings. In the case of EIDs with origins in wildlife, diverse ecosystems present a hazard of high pathogen diversity; this paper is concerned with measuring the risk of an outbreak. While drivers of endemic infectious disease, especially vector-borne pathogens such as malaria, have shown promise as targets of remote-sensing based surveillance programs, these efforts must be considered separately from the approach described here as they involve different assumptions of both hazard and risk.",

However, both [46] and [47] present findings that suggest disruptions are more likely to promote outbreak events when they incur in such a way as to fragment previously intact ecosystems of a certain minimum diameter. These findings are important for the remote sensing community, because adoption and refinement of EBVs can facilitate real-time measurement of tropical forest fragmentation to a more robust degree than previous methodologies. Specifically, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and leaf area index can supplement the methodologies utilized in these studies to broaden our scientific understanding of how ecosystem change promotes spillover events. Does loss of specific keystone species in tropical forest ecosystems, such as tree species that provide food sources to bat populations, play an outsized role in promoting zoonotic spillover, or are outbreaks more likely irrespective of the nature of the disruption? Does clearing of tree species of a certain age or density matter? Further characterization with EBVs can provide important insight into these questions.",

As discussed, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and leaf area index are readily available candidates, while vegetation height and taxonomic diversity are appropriate targets for forthcoming LiDAR and hyperspectral instruments. This highlights the importance of airborne observations: as new instruments become available, data from short-duration airborne instruments will play a critical role in calibration. Finally, field-level data will continue to be the foundation of future surveillance efforts. Understanding the sensitivity and extent of ecosystem change, as well as human factors, necessary to promote an outbreak requires precise geographic identification of the index or original human case in an outbreak event. Often, this information is provided at the city or district level, which complicates the system described here.

From here, higher resolution and airborne imagery can be tasked using a \u201ctip and cue\u201d strategy to validate or invalidate alerts.
