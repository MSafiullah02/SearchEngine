While we are fully confident that this is the case, it is nonetheless clear that in previous epidemics, as well as in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, older persons are, once again, paying the heaviest toll. Indeed, in the case of the current COVID-19 crisis, in Sub-Saharan Africa, no specific measures have been taken to protect elders, as there have been in high-income countries. In African countries, the main measures taken to stem the spread of the disease include closing borders, grounding commercial flights from severely affected countries, and postponing or cancelling major cultural or sporting events. These measures, while necessary and effective (on condition that they are properly implemented and respected), actually barely affect older people, who travel less than their younger counterparts and less frequently participate in large cultural or sports-related gatherings. Conversely, older people have a leading role in collective activities of daily life, which continue unimpeded, such as prayer groups, weddings, christenings and funerals. Older people also continue to stand in for parents, minding children with whom they are naturally in very close contact. All these circumstances combine to put older people at risk of contracting a range of communicable diseases, not least COVID-19.",

Yet they are likely to draw but little benefit from the experience acquired in western countries, notably because the measures applied in high-income countries are not appropriate solutions for Sub-Saharan Africa. At present, total lockdown is the only measure that is unanimously considered to be efficacious. It has been widely implemented in western countries. Currently, the focal point of the epidemic, while we await, is either an efficacious treatment or a vaccine, either (or both) of which may take several months to emerge. The social, economic and cultural context in Sub-Saharan Africa renders total confinement virtually impossible. We also must not ignore the deleterious effect that lockdown has on social terms, isolating frail individuals and leaving them without support or resources.",

We are aware that in today\u2019s world, where social intermingling and movement is highly prevalent, it is difficult to implement targeted measures. However, giving the issue sufficient thought is a prerequisite to finding acceptable and efficacious solutions. Nkengasong and Mankoula [5] exhort us to act collectively and fast. We say hear, hear\u2014but let us not leave the older population behind when we move forward! The COVID-19 crisis is afflicting the whole world and so the search for solutions should also include the whole world, taking account of local context. Similarly, provision of resources to fight the epidemic should also occur on a worldwide scale. Indeed, the crisis will only come to an end when every country in the world has vanquished COVID-19. In this regard, and to avoid any ageism, we applaud and adhere to the suggestion of Lloyd-Sherlock et al. [3] to take age explicitly into account in the development of national and global planning for COVID-19, and to convene a global expert group for older people to provide guidance and inform our response to this urgent global health threat.",
