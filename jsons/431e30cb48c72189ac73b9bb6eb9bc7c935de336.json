As of 30.03.2020, total of 770,165 confirmed cases (including 36,938 deaths in 152 geographical territories) have been reported to the WHO, and this number is still increasing. Although COVID-19 appears to have greater infectivity and lower mortality than SARS and MERS, many uncertainties (including route of infection, viral evolution, epidemic dynamics, appropriate anti-viral treatment, and strategies for disease control) remain. On March 11, 2020 , the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic (3) . Since there is no cure for this viral disease and a long wait is needed to find a vaccine, a rigorous epidemiological measure was first taken. The largest quarantine in history was made, between 50 and 60 million people in several Chinese cities were quarantined; which included necessary hygiene measures, group meetings were canceled, schools closed, and travel banned. Some believe that a later evaluation of all the more modern epidemiological measures will show whether all of them are justified, as experts point to procedures that curb a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by another type of virus Corona.",

In the largest published clinical cohort of COVID-19 to date, acute cardiac injury, shock, and ar-rhythmia were present in 7.2%, 8.7%, and 16.7% of patients, respectively (9), with higher prevalence amongst patients requiring intensive care. CVDs may become unstable in the setting of viral infection as a consequence of imbalance between infection-induced increase in metabolic demand and reduced cardiac reserve. Patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure may be at particular risk as a result of coronary plaque rupture secondary to virally induced systemic inflammation, and rigorous use of plaque stabilizing agents (aspirin, statins, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) has been suggested as a possible therapeutic strategy. Pro-coagulant effects of systemic inflammation (10) may increase the likelihood of stent thrombosis and assessment of platelet function and intensified anti-platelet therapy should be considered in those with a history of previous coronary intervention.",

Lipid metabolism remained disrupted 12 years after clinical recovery in a metabolomic study amongst 25 SARS survivors (12) , whereas cardiac abnormalities observed during hospitalisation in eight patients with H7N9 influenza returned to normal at 1-year follow-up (13) .

Doctors quickly looked to see if any of the existing medicines were leading to an improvement in their condition. First, Chinese experts have shown that the antimalarial drug (chloroquine) is effective in patients. Then, a few days ago, French researchers showed in a very small group of patients that the concomitant administration of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin (Sumamed) had an even better effect in COVID-19 patients. Although these studies are insufficient (due to small sample size and poor clinical experimental design), they indicate that, despite the adverse effects of Azithromycin (severe diarrhea due to Clostridium difficile and prolonged QT interval on ECG), mortality due to infection with a new virus. It should be noted that in 1980, researchers at the PLIVA drug factory found a macrolide antibiotic, Azithromycin, but sold all distribution rights to the European Community and the US in 1986 to Pfizer (14) .",

There is a considerable debate among biomedical scientists and physicians as to whether patients should stop taking ACE inhibitors (ACEI: Enalapril, Lisinopril, Ramipril and others) and angiotensin receptor blocking drugs (ARB: Losartan, Eprosartan, Valsartan and others) due to their increase of ACE-2 activity and rise of the ACE-2 receptors (16) . These drugs help thousands of patients with high blood pressure, chronic heart failure, diabetic kidney damage and other vascular disorders (17) . Discontinuing these medicines could have many serious consequences, although medical opinions remain divided (18) .

Mortality was significantly higher in patients with chronic comorbid conditions. Impairment in the immune response to the virus led to severe respiratory failure, which was accompanied by alveo-capillary block due to the diffuse inflammation of the alveolar and vascular structures of the lung, as the body's immune system activates proinflammatory mediators (cytokines and others) that cause block of the alveolar activation and surfactant inactivation.

The current pandemic, however, has led to dramatic changes in the lives of every inhabitant of this planet, and the greatest challenges for each country public health and health care systems. Despite the genetic similarity, the new virus has other modes of transmission, and appears to have a greater ability to block an adequate immune response, leading to more severe forms of ARDS. After it causes respiratory symptoms, the virus infects all other organ systems (cardiovascular, hematopoietic, digestive, then the kidney, skin, CNS) through the blood (viremia) and can lead to multiorgan failure. The ACE 2 receptors, which are used by the virus to enter the cells of the respiratory system for reproduction, also have other organs, which can be affected at the very beginning of the disease. Such a condition can lead to an overreaction of the immune system with the production of a number of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, and cause \"cytokine storm\" (27) .",

MOST IMPORTANT GUIDELINES FOR PREVENTION COVID-19 INFECTION ON WEB SITES The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has developed interim guidance for businesses and employers to plan for and respond to COVID-19 (25). The interim guidance is intended to help prevent workplace exposures to acute respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19.Older adults and those with underlying chronic medical conditions seem to be at higher risk, according to the CDC. As the illness is thought to spread from person to person, experts advise washing hands, avoiding close contact with others, and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Wear a mask if you are sick or caring for someone who is (25).
