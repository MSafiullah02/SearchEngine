In the current ET practice with dromedary camels, example, hatched embryos are preferably collected on Days 7, 8, or 9 after ovulation with the intention of enhancing the recovery rate. Therefore, the protocols developed for nonhatched embryos in other species are unsuitable for freezing camelid hatched embryos.II.A much larger variation in embryo size: Embryo size not only differs between donors on Days 6, 7, and 8 but it can also vary substantially between embryos harvested from one animal. Thus, there is a challenge to develop protocols that fit different-sized embryos [27].III.A great amount of lipids in embryos: Similar to porcine embryos, camelid embryos contain a high concentration of lipids\u2014this has been shown to have an adverse effect on conventional freezing methods [28], [29].IV.The lack of a convenient and reliable evaluation system for embryo quality: The morphologic appearance of cryopreserved embryos does not always correlate to their developmental potential, and so, it is insufficient to assess the outcome of the cryopreservation and to predict ET success [27].\n",

Briefly, the results of those works have shown that camel embryos are sensitive to PROH, DMSO, and glycerol but tolerant to EG [18]. Subsequent studies were performed to determine the minimum exposure time to 1.5-M EG required to achieve cryoprotection and to compare different methods of rehydration with or without sucrose. The highest pregnancy rate (37%) was achieved when the embryos were exposed to EG for 10 minutes, cooled slowly at a rate of \u22120.5 \u00b0C/min to \u221233 \u00b0C before plunging into liquid nitrogen, and then thawed and rehydrated in 0.2-M sucrose in holding media for 5 minutes [18]. In comparison to vitrification, the relatively higher pregnancy rate from slow-frozen embryos may be due to more intact cytoskeleton integrity. Cell death associated with slow freezing was comparable to that of unfrozen control cells, but freezing caused widespread disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, indicating that levels of cell death in an embryo may not be as critical as cytoskeleton integrity for embryo survival and implantation. It appears that slow freezing maintains better cytoskeleton integrity of embryos compared with vitrification [36].",

A combination of higher concentrations of CPAs and an increased cooling/warming rate reduces ice crystal formation and thus improves the survival of biological material. Although current vitrification methods differ considerably in technical detail between laboratories or clinics, four basic components are similar in all disciplines:I.Equilibration and vitrification media: 7.5% (v/v) EG and DMSO, and 15% to 16% (v/v) EG and DMSO plus sucrose, respectively.II.Equilibration and vitrification temperature: Room temperature (22 \u00b0C\u201327 \u00b0C) or mammalian body temperature (37 \u00b0C) are used, with a principle of the higher the temperature, the faster the loading rate.III.Exposure duration: Embryos are exposed to the equilibration media for times ranging from 3 to 15 minutes, and then vitrification is achieved within 40 to 60 seconds.IV.Warming: Direct warming of carrier tools in holding media with sucrose (\u223c1 M) at 37 \u00b0C (\u223c2 minutes), and then, embryos are equilibrated sequentially in a series of solutions with decreasing concentrations of sucrose, preferably at room temperature (22 \u00b0C\u201325 \u00b0C) for up to 15 minutes to ensure complete rehydration.\n",

After a thorough examination of different parameters, an optimized protocol (7.5% EG + 0.25 M sucrose for 1 minute, a second equilibration solution 15% EG + 0.5 M sucrose for 2 minutes, followed by two drops of 30% EG + 1 M sucrose vitrification solution for 20 seconds each) was established [27]. Unfortunately, despite a high survival rate (91%) as judged by the morphologic appearance of embryos after warming and in culture, the transfer of 18 vitrified embryos (Day 7 or 8) into six recipients (three each) during the breeding season resulted in no pregnancy (unpublished data). In a subsequent experiment, 10 vitrified embryos were transferred into five recipients (two each), who had received 75 mg progesterone-in-oil (intramuscularly) for 3 days before transfer and for another 14 days after transfer when the pregnancy could be identified by ultrasonography. This exogenous progesterone was injected in case the frozen/thawed embryos did not produce enough maternal recognition of pregnancy signal to maintain the CL and prevent luteolysis. However, there was still no pregnancies, apparently indicating a total lack of developmental competence of those vitrified embryos (unpublished data). The frustrating results of these transfers imply that the current protocol still needs further modification, and importantly, that the morphological integrity of frozen embryos cannot be used to predict the success of ET outcome [27].",

However, the transfer of those embryos produced healthy offspring with a high rate of success (9/11, 82%). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that removal of lipids from embryos before cryopreservation may be vital not only for survival but most importantly to retain developmental competence [29].",

            "text": "In comparison to slow controlled-rate freezing, vitrification is a simple and advantageous technique, thus becoming the dominant approach for cryopreservation of reproductive cells [15], [17], [27], [29]. Recent achievements with in vitro survival of hatched blastocysts from the dromedary camel after vitrification are promising [27]. However, more work is required to clarify the reasons for there being different requirements for in vitro and in vivo development. To optimize further parameters, the following procedures or techniques might be considered.I.Cytoskeleton stabilization: Cytoskeleton-stabilizing agents, such as the cytochalasins (cyto-b), have been used in pig embryo vitrification to prevent cytoskeletal disruption during and after cryopreservation. The landmark success of live piglet production from embryos frozen by stabilized vitrification shows the importance of the cytoskeleton structure for retaining developmental competence of embryos [29]. However, the effect of cyto-b on the outcome of vitrification appears to be dependent on the developmental stage of embryos (e.g., hatched embryos in pig), with a narrow size range (e.g., 325\u2013375 \u03bcm). This feature may limit its broader application in vitrification, but it can be circumvented by culturing early stage embryos in vitro to meet these requirements [29]. In a preliminary experiment, Day 7 camel embryos (n = 36) were recovered and cultured with or without pretreatment with 7.5-\u03bcg/mL cyto-b. Eleven embryos were vitrified after cyto-b treatment (French straw method, [10]), and 16 embryos were not frozen but used to determine if prefreezing treatment alone caused cell damage. Without freezing, cyto-b did not affect cell viability as 12/16 (75%) transferred embryos resulted in pregnancies. However, after cryopreservation, 0/11 (0%) embryos pretreated with cyto-b and 3/9 (33%) without cyto-b pretreatment resulted in a pregnancy (unpublished data). It is obvious that cyto-b treatment does not have any lasting detrimental effects on embryo developmental competence, but that the treatment also does not provide protection for the embryo cytoskeleton during vitrification. A similar effect of cyto-b treatment on embryos has also been observed in an equine study [40].II.Development of modified carrier tools: Carrier tools that are better adapted to the larger size and special structure of zona-free camel embryos may improve results. Although a direct comparison of OPS straws versus 0.25 mL French straws was not carried out [10], it appears that a relatively larger vitrification volume is beneficial for embryo survival (Vajta G, personal communication).III.Delipidation: Removal of intracellular lipids by centrifugation and subsequent micromanipulation has been shown to be effective in the vitrification of pig morulae and early blastocysts [29]. When undertaking ET of camelids, for example, in dromedary camels, the uterus is flushed 7 to 8 days after mating to enhance the recovery rate; however, embryos are hatched at this stage. Without the protection of the zonae pellucidae, it would be difficult to centrifuge hatched blastocysts and to perform delipation. But it may be possible to collect expanded blastocysts from Day 6 donors, with two flushes at intervals of 12 hours. Collection and cryopreservation of unhatched embryos will have to be established if international exportation and transportation is intended, as current regulations allow only pathogen-free embryos with an intact zona pellucida to be exported [41].IV.Embryo size: To overcome the problems associated with the large variation of embryo size from superovulated donors, the selection of a superovulation protocol appears to be an option for producing uniform embryos. For example, superovulation of dromedary camels with two injections of FSH dissolved in hyaluronan solution produces more similar sized embryos compared to other protocols [42].V.A novel nonpenetrating CPA, carboxylated \u03b5-poly-L-Lysin (PLL): A Japanese group has recently reported that the addition of PLL in vitrification solutions significantly improved the survival rate of mouse oocytes and embryos [43]. Unfortunately, this product is not commercially available. The authors are currently collaborating with this group to see if PLL can improve the survival rate of dromedary camel embryos after freezing.VI.Automation of freezing procedures: Inconsistencies in the manual handling of samples and differences between individual embryologists can only be eliminated by full automation of the established procedure\u2014an unavoidable task of the next decade applicable to cryopreservation for all species including humans, and for all procedures in assisted reproduction [44].VII.Synchrony between donor and recipient: Apart from the quality of embryos, the optimal pregnancy rates of ET may depend on various other factors, such as the preparation of the recipient females. The degree of ovulation synchrony between donor and recipient appears to be of paramount importance for the success of an ET program. In the dromedary camel, for example, the pregnancy rate was highest (67%) when embryos were transferred into the recipients that had ovulated 24 hours after the donor, whereas the pregnancy rates dropped sharply to less than 10% if embryos were transferred to the recipients that had ovulated 72 hours behind the donor [45].VIII.Inhibition of luoteolysis in recipient females: Due to the lack of the cyclical CL and a relatively short luteal lifespan of only 8\u201310 days in camelids, prolongation of the lifespan of the CL appears to be beneficial for establishing pregnancy by allowing more time for the embryos to secrete the important maternal recognition of pregnancy signal to the mother. The oral administration of the prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, meclofenamic acid, can prevent both the luteolytic action of exogenous PGF2\u03b1 and the normal increase in periphereal plasma PMSG concentrations in late diestrus, thereby prolonging the luteal phase and improving the pregnancy rate of ET [46].\n",
