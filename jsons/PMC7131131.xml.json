From this, we infer that their personal experience is that they do not always respond accurately or at all to questionnaires. We wonder whether this holds true for all medical students, as they write as a sample of two, and also whether this is true of all cultures. Chinese students tend to comply with our requests to complete questionnaires and we have high response rates, particularly when it is an important topic, as H1N1 was at the time of the study. The questionnaire was distributed to those studying at summer school at CUHK at a time when Hong Kong was following a strategy of containment of H1N1, a strategy not adopted in Western countries. This difference of approach is just one indicator of the different cultural attitudes and responses, which also included quarantine of 300 hotel guests following diagnosis of the first case of H1N1.",

We were therefore required to minimize the impact of seeking opinions as the authorities believed we might destabilize the students. We do not believe that one always needs to reaffirm results with further qualitative study, apart from which qualitative studies at this point would not have been appropriate.",

Instead, as a framework, we utilized previous questionnaires designed by our Centre for Health Behaviours Research, such as one disseminated to investigate H5N1 avian influenza.3 We added questions pertinent to the outbreak amongst the summer school students, for which no standard instrument could have been available, and were in regular discussion with colleagues in a Hong Kong-wide group who were undertaking a series of studies, now published in a variety of journals, for which we all received national funding to explore different aspects of the H1N1 pandemic in the city.4, 5, 6, 7\n",

However, prior to the delivery, we tried to collect data via the Internet whilst all attendees were excluded from the classroom and being taught online due to the outbreak, but the response rate was rather low. In contrast, attendance on Day 24 was good and there was no particular group of non-attendees, so representation was good in terms of country of study, which was reflective of student make-up. Another factor contributing to the timing was the opportunity, during a time of dynamic changes including a national shift from a containment policy to a mitigation policy, to collect data related to the unexpected outbreak amongst our students. This foreseen opportunity provided us a means to explore more research questions related to antiviral prophylaxis and other issues.",

The majority of our respondents were of Chinese origin, and many were Hong Kong students studying outside Hong Kong and returning for the summer. We were primarily interested in the country of study as a significant factor amongst a homogeneous community of students, and its impact on compliance and perceptions towards pandemic preparedness. Our findings of the importance of environmental factors and national policies are relevant to other universities, and may have implications for other policy makers. These findings have contributed to the knowledge base, and these results were shared within our university through the appropriate administrative studies as well as through the Healthy University Network of all universities in Hong Kong.",
