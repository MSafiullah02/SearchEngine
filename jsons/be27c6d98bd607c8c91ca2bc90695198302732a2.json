A closed suction catheter with an infraglottic tip should be attached to the circuit to be used for suctioning. If disconnection from the breathing circuit is necessary, the ventilator should be switched to standby and the ETT should be clamped. After tracheal intubation, disposable equipment should be discarded, reusable equipment should be placed inside sheaths and decontaminated, and if the intubation room is separate from the OD, doffing of PPE should be performed and monitored by an observer. The room should be empty for 20 minutes before cleaning to allow aerosols to settle. In the OR, PPE should be worn until the end of the procedure, after immediately changing the outer gloves. Hand hygiene must be performed before and after all patient contact and the risks of aerosol transmission with coughing and the need for reintubation should be weighed before attempting to extubate the patient. (10, 11) Another recommendation is to avoid performing non-intubated thoracic surgery due to the lack of data of performing these procedures on patients with highly contagious diseases and because the use of this procedure would leave the airway unsecured, increasing the risk of contagion. Except for the Helmet, all types of noninvasive ventilation are associated with a risk of aerosol spread and it is recommended that both noninvasive ventilation and high flow nasal cannula be avoided in these patients.",

Patients with a known difficult airway should remain intubated. Medications that lower the incidence of coughing, such as dexmedetomidine, may be administered and the use of an N95 or surgical mask on the patient's face after extubation with an oxygen mask over it can prevent aerosolization while oxygenating the patient.

It can be transmitted by respiratory droplets as well as direct contact, and both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients can be infective. (1) Anesthesiologists, especially thoracic anesthesiologists, are at increased risk of exposure due to direct contact with the trachea during intubation, bronchoscopy, airway suctioning before, during, and after one lung ventilation (OLV), and during extubation, in patients who may present with varying degrees of respiratory infection. In this issue of the Journal, \u015eent\u00fcrk M and the European Association of Cardiothoracic Anaesthesiology (EACTA) Thoracic Subspecialty Committee have developed preliminary recommendations for the airway management of thoracic surgical patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The goals of these recommendations are to emphasize efficient airway control and to establish controlled ventilation without compromising the patient while providing maximal protection to the health care team. Tracheal intubation in COVID-19 patients is a high-risk procedure because of aerosol transmission during tracheal intubation either with a double lumen tube (DLT) or endotracheal tube (ETT) with a bronchial blocker (BB), as well as during bronchoscopy to evaluate and manage the device. Intubation is also a risk for patients",

            "text": "infectious. Other recommendations are that elective intubations are preferable over emergency intubations, that the intubation should occur in a negative pressure room with >12 air changes/minute, the level of personal protection equipment (PPE) should include a respiratory type mask and face shield or helmet and if the OR does not have a negative pressure room, the intubation should be performed in a negative pressure room followed by transfer to the OR. In a positive pressure room, the room should be placed under the least possible positive pressure with the door closed with the rest of the OR under higher positive pressure to limit the dispersion of aerosols. The intubating team should be limited to those with essential roles and should be the most experienced providers, one to manage the airway and the other to administer medications and to assist. Those not required for airway management should be outside of the room until the airway is secured. The operating room and immediate area are divided into 3 zones, the red zone, where the actual procedure takes place, a yellow zone, located outside of the operating room, where a physician with full PPE is available if help is required, and a white zone, outside of the OR, where an observer can monitor the donning and doffing of PPE. The authors also suggest different levels of PPE depending on the level of exposure. Procedures defined as having an increased risk of infection are the most aerosol generating procedures, such as intubation and bronchoscopy.During these procedures, the authors suggest the use of airborne level precautions including hair covers/hoods, a fitted filtering facepiece or N95 mask, goggles or face shield, long sleeve fluid resistant gowns, double gloves, and shoe covers, with a specific sequence for donning and doffing the PPE to avoid the spread of infection.In preparation for intubation, it is recommended that a stand be set up with single use blades, laryngoscopes, video laryngoscopes, and flexible bronchoscopes, a closed system forsuction, endotracheal tubes (ETT) and devices for OLV, including BBs and DLTs. An antiviral filter should be attached to the expiratory limb of the circuit. Patient position should be optimized before intubation and the patient adequately preoxygenated to prevent or reduce the need for mask ventilation. If face mask ventilation is required, a 2-person, low flow, low pressure technique should be used, with a 2 handed grip on the face mask to improve seal. A rapid sequence induction should be performed. Intubation should be performed using videolaryngoscopy with a single use blade and remote screen to minimize or avoid airborne spread of aerosolized secretions. The suggested algorithm for an unanticipated difficult intubation includes laryngoscopy with an ETT with a stylet, and if that attempt fails, oxygenation should be performed using a low tidal volume/low pressure technique. If the second attempt at laryngoscopy fails, the use of a second generation intubating supraglottic airway device should be considered with intubation through this device using fiberoptic bronchoscopy and a remote screen. The ETT cuff or tracheal cuff of the DLT should be inflated to seal the airway before initiating ventilation and the cuff pressure should be at least 5-10 cm H 2 O above maximal airway pressure to minimize the risks for aerosol spread. The choice of device used for OLV varies on the indication, the difficulty of intubation, the length of the procedure, and whether postoperative ventilation is required. BBs are recommended for patients where separation is required, for shorter procedures, and in patients with a potentially difficult airway, for those who arrive to the OR intubated, or when postoperative ventilation is anticipated. DLTs are indicated for patients where lung isolation and suctioning are required or the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is anticipated. If available, a DLT with an embedded camera can minimize the requirement for a bronchoscope and avoid opening the airway. For airway manipulations such bronchoscopy or airway suctioning, it is suggested that an ET-tube swivel connector with a valve that prevents leakage from the airway be used. Before opening the valve to introduce the bronchoscope or suction catheter, the anesthesia ventilator should be paused and the procedure performed under apnea.",
