Any kind of impairment in protein production, such as production of mutated protein or misfolded protein, leads to disruption of the pathway controlled by that protein. This may manifest in the form of the disease. However, these diseases can be treated, by supplying the protein from outside or exogenously. The supply of active exogenous protein requires its production on large scale to fulfill the growing demand. The process is complex, requiring higher protein expression, purification, and processing. Each product needs unique settings or standardizations for large-scale production and purification. As only large-scale production can fulfill the growing demand, thus it needs to be cost-effective. The tools of genetic engineering are utilized to produce the proteins of human origin in bacteria, fungi, insect, or mammalian host (Fig. 4.1). Usage of recombinant DNA technology for large-scale production of proteins requires ample amount of time, labor, and resources, but it also offers many opportunities for economic growth. After reading this chapter, readers would be able to understand the basics about production of recombinant proteins in various hosts along with the advantages and limitations of each host system and properties and production of some of the important pharmaceutical compounds and growth factors.\n",

In eukaryotes the sequence (analogous to \u221210\u2014consensus sequence of prokaryotes), TATAAAA, is present at \u221230 position in the promoter region. Eukaryotic promoter is shown (Fig. 4.2a) with TATA box forming the core promoter at \u221230 position (from \u221230 to \u2212100), upstream of transcription start site. CAAT box and GC box are at approximately \u221270\u201390 and \u2212100, respectively. The location of promoter is always on the same DNA molecule which they regulate. They are referred as cis-acting elements. The spacing of various elements is more important and much is dependent on locus-specific activators, either at core promoter or at distant sites. Various other signals as enhancers are also involved which are far apart from the target gene. They exert stimulatory effects on promoter activity and can be upstream, downstream or in the middle of the gene. Promoters of housekeeping genes or genes with complex patterns of expression have CpG islands rather than TATA box. The gene to be transcribed has 5\u02b9-untranslated region (5\u02b9 UTR), exons (coding region) separated by introns (noncoding region). The end has 3\u02b9-untranslated region (3\u02b9 UTR). In the cloning for gene expression, usually intronless version of the gene is used. In eukaryotes, the transcription is further enhanced by enhancers, which may be 2,000\u20133,000 bases away from the promoter region but are able to affect the rate of transcription.",

            "text": "Expression and production of eukaryotic protein require cloning of its cDNA in an expression vector and subsequent transfer of the vector in suitable host. DNA is modified, cloned, and expressed in other host for the production of the protein; thus, optimum production conditions are required in each host. However, there are yield variations in different expression systems but high-level expression of the protein may be achieved by considering the following points:The recombinant gene should be with all the necessary elements for effective transcription initiation.Use is made of strong viral or cellular promoter/enhancer for efficient driving of transcription. The usage of viral T7 promoter in bacteria can result in higher yield of recombinant proteins. Transgene may be expressed under the control of either polyhedrin promoter of baculovirus, E1 promoterof adenovirus, or p7.5 promoterof Vaccinia virus. These are suitable for wide range of cell types. Mammalian cells may use promoter and enhancer of SV40 or the long-terminal-repeat promoter and enhancer of the Rous sarcoma virus or early promoter of the human cytomegalovirus (refer to Chap. 10.1007/978-981-10-0875-7_2 for promoters and expression vectors).Polyadenylation signals are helpful in eukaryotic genes. These terminators are required for defined 3\u2032 end to the mRNA which extends by addition of poly A tail ultimately increasing the stability of RNA and facilitating its export to the cytoplasm.Removal of 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 UTRs (untranslated repeats) may influence gene expression. They may interfere with initiation of translation and their secondary structure prevents efficient translation.Kozak\u2019s consensus 5\u2032-CCRCCAUGG-3\u2032 with purine at \u22123 position and guanine at +4 position affects transgene expression.Inclusion of one intron sequence, which is located between the promoter and cDNA coding sequence, gives better yield; thus, most expression vectors include at least one intron sequence. Intron presence is of importance when transgene needs to be expressed in mammalian cells.For eliminating the slow rates of translation due to codon biasing, the gene may be converted to a high-expressing gene by changing the t-RNA codons to the most abundant ones.The integration site has a major effect on the rate of the transcription of the recombinant gene (position effect).Some selective genes like dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or glutamine synthetase (GS) gene are incorporated. The genes are involved in nucleotide biosynthesis and glutamine synthetase, respectively; the selection occurs when the appropriate metabolite is missing preventing the growth of non-transformed cells.For increasing the yield of the recombinant protein, the protein is often fused with endogenous protein sequence (see Chap. 10.1007/978-981-10-0875-7_5 for selectable markers, reporters).To aid purification, the protein-encoding DNA contains coding DNA for specific protein or peptide that can be a target for affinity chromatography.For affinity purification, two systems are readily employed, (1) glutathione S-transferase (GST)\u2013glutathione affinity and (2) polyhistidine\u2013nickel ion affinity. GST has high affinity for glutathione and protein with side chains of histidine has high affinity for nickel ions.Stable transfection gives high yield of protein. After recombinant DNA is transfected into animal cells, it either can be integrated (stable expression) into the host genome or maintained in episomal form (transient expression). In stable expression systems, the foreign gene is passed on to the next descendants, and the expression is maintained generation after generation.\n",

            "text": "The microbe of first choice for production of recombinant protein is enterobacterium E. coli. The system offers quick and easy modifications, ease of growing in manageable environmental conditions and short life cycle. The bacterial cell can tolerate and adapt to changes in the environment rapidly, thus scale-up is easier. However, the system suffers from some of the disadvantages [11,16].Human or mammalian genes cloned in bacteria cannot undergo splicing due to lack of splicing machinery, thus intron-less version of the gene is cloned for optimum results (Fig. 4.2b).The signals involved in transcription of genes may vary; thus, the gene of interest is usually fused with bacterial gene under the control of its promoter, and the protein is obtained as a fusion product, which can be later cleaved, purified, and used.Lac promoter is one of the most popular bacterial promoters. However, for high-level expression, T7 promoteris also preferred (present in pET vectors). It can drive the target protein expression to nearly 50 % of total cell protein. Gene of interest can be placed under the control of regulated promoterof phage.For translation, abundance of t-RNA is related to the frequency of appearance of different codons (codon biasing). Therefore, codons rare for E. coli may cause amino acid misincorporation or premature termination affecting the yield of the therapeutic protein. This can be solved by either site-directed replacement of rare codons to the codons (for the same amino acid) preferred by E. coli. Another approach may be co-expression of rare t-RNAs in E. coli (strains of E. coli, BL21 codon plus, and Rosetta were designed for this purpose). For addition of amino acids during the process of translation, as there are more than one codon for several amino acids, thus, codon biasing occurs which is the preference of a particular codon of amino acid in a particular species (Fig. 4.2c).Complexity: Eukaryotic cells have the advantage of producing fully functional and properly folded proteins. The antibodies with four subunits may be secreted by eukaryotic cells in fully functional form. On the other hand, it is very difficult to obtain multidomain protein from E. coli. Even if protein is obtained, the renaturation and folding in laboratory condition may either be very expensive or protein may lack its activity.Lack of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) is the problem, which cannot be solved, and is mandatory for activity of many therapeutic proteins. The glycosylation is the most common modifications, and others are phosphorylation and formation of disulfide bond, which are essentially required for the full functional capability of many human proteins. PTMs play an important role in proper protein folding, processing, stability, tissue targeting, activity, immune reactivity, and half-life of the protein. Lack of these results in insoluble, unstable, or inactive product.However, the N-linked glycosylation system of Campylobacter jejuni has been successfully transferred to E. coli, thus opening a possibility for the production of glycosylated protein in it. Certain mutant E. coli are being developed to promote disulfide bond formation (AD494, Origami, Rosetta-gami) with reduced protease activity (BLZ1).Overproduction of recombinant protein in bacteria might result in the loss of solubility and deposition of many protein species as protein aggregates or inclusion bodies. Alteration in growth conditions might render the product in insoluble form. Many eukaryotic proteins are found trapped in inclusion bodies with resistance to further processing. Success has been obtained in purification of insulin and betaferon from inclusion bodies. The retrieval of proteins using denaturating condition with subsequent refolding and renaturation might not always be easy and prove to be extremely expensive.With the E. coli host, it is very difficult to obtain protein larger than 60 kDa in soluble form.Due to certain limitations for production of proteins in E. coli, other host systems are being discussed for production of proteins.\n",

As there are differences in the promoterof E. coli and eukaryotes, thus eukaryotic promotermight not work in E. coli, and the gene is placed under the control of E. coli promoter. (b) In the eukaryotes the splicing machinery removes introns from the target gene. Whereas the E. coli does not have any such system, therefore, the intronless version of gene is used in E. coli. (c) shows codon bias in bacterial and human system. As one amino acid is encoded by more than one codon, for example, proline, where preferential codons in humans are CCA whereas E. coli prefers CCG, if the gene containing the preferential codons for humans is used in E. coli, then it might result in inefficient translation. Thus, these problems need to be taken care of while using E. coli as host",

The E. coli is unable to perform glycosylation. Fungi are simplest eukaryotic systems which can perform glycosylation. The use of fungal host (Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) for production of recombinant proteins results in hyper-glycosylation. The figure shows glycosylation pattern in human, mammalian, Pichia, and Saccharomyces systems. The hyper-glycosylations or abnormal glycosylations can make the protein highly immunogenic making it unsuitable for therapeutic purposes",
