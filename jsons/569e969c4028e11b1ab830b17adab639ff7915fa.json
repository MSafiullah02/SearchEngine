As from the 2nd week post-infection (pi), neurological disease inducing 100% mortality at 1 month was evident. At day 5 pi, viral antigen was first detected at footpad level in epidermic and dermic cells, as well as in neighbouring myocytes; labeled macrophages infiltrating small nerve branches were also disclosed. As from 10-15 days pi, viral antigen became apparent along ipsilateral sciatic nerve structures and within lumbar spinal ganglion neurons, followed by a fast viral spread throughout CNS neurons that involved spinal cord and brain.",

Virus was initially A blood, Q footpad neural tissues than in blood. At electron microscopy, the failure to find budding or mature viral particles in sciatic nerve samples was probably due to low infectivity titers, recalling similar difficulties to visualize JV in other substrates [14] . However, findings for other neurotropic viruses [13] provide an alternative explanation: JV may be picked up and uncoated at nerve terminals, and its structural components rather than whole particles carried out along axoplasm up to the first neuronal relay represented by spinal ganglion. The fact that viral antigen was present in sciatic nerve structures corresponding to probable axons as well in Schwann cell cytoplasm, suggests a double neural route, mainly by retrograde axonal flow and partly by cell-to-cell transport. Nevertheless, fast viral spread by anterograde axonal flow implying transport from the spinal ganglion to the sciatic nerve by a pathway as the one already advanced for herpes simplex [11] and Borna [3] viruses, should be kept in mind. At any rate, once JV multiplication began in ganglionic neurons, it was promptly followed by an explosive viral diffusion to ascending CNS levels, perhaps attributable to the transneuronal transfer that has been established for other viruses such as rabies [4] , herpes simplex [12, 27] , herpes suis [20] , and Borna D].",

On comparing the clinical expression following JV footpad inoculation with the intraperitoneal route, the former proved somewhat more severe than the latter (100% mortality vs 85%). Although JV is able to multiply and harbour within peritoneal macrophages [2] , these cells must circumvent the blood-brain barrier to gain access to CNS, an obstacle that may explain why neurological disease is not an invariable outcome. In contrast, by footpad inoculation, such a neurotropic virus could achieve direct contact with nerve endings, and thus be able to adopt the neural route instead of becoming a major source of viremia as other viruses that primarily multiply in striated muscle [-7, 8, 21] .",
