Restrictions during the pandemic mean that funerals carried out in this time are unlikely to match the wishes of the bereaved or the deceased. However, it is possible to adapt funeral services using online methods to ensure important people are included, even if attendance isn\u2019t possible (Table 2). After the crisis, relatives can ceremonies to remember their loved one, and culturally sensitive bereavement services held in hospitals may be helpful in for closure and to show respect for the dead(11).",

While war metaphors have limitations, we know from the experiences of clinicians in China, Italy, and Switzerland that care of patients with COVID-19 results in major ethical dilemmas and a psychological toll on the health care teams caring for them, in part due to limited resources(14, 35). Frontline staff are at risk of secondary or vicarious trauma, as a result of repeated empathic engagement with sadness and loss(36), as well as moral injury(37), resulting from actions, or the lack of them, which violate one\u2019s moral or ethical code.

Self-care strategies and individual \u2018resilience tools\u2019 such as mindfulness and reflective practice are insufficient; resilience should not become another responsibility of staff working in traumatic conditions, but requires an organisational and systemic response(40). Organisations should actively monitor frontline staff, facilitate effective team cohesion and implement strategies to support teams\u2019 day-to-day work, including informal debriefing and peer support. Single-session psychological debriefing approaches should be avoided as they may cause additional harm(39). Leaders and organisations should also make professional sources of support readily available; this includes formal bereavement counselling, which can enhance awareness about vicarious traumatisation and encourage adaptive coping strategies(36).",

Understanding the risk of trauma and moral injury to staff in the current pandemic is essential for the early identification and prevention of harm. Drawing on best available evidence, we have made recommendations for mitigating negative effects on bereaved relatives and healthcare professionals. These include proactive, sensitive and regular communication with family members alongside accurate information provision; enabling family members to say goodbye in person and supporting virtual communication; providing excellent symptom management and emotional and spiritual support; sign-posting to bereavement services; and supporting bereaved relatives to adapt funerals and seek appropriate bereavement support, as well as consistent leadership and support for health professionals in the frontline.",
