In addition, an announcement by the National Institute for Health Research has called for a pause in commencement of all new clinical trials in order to mobilise and maximise healthcare resources.1 Indeed, during this time, many of these changes will inevitably have adverse consequences on the day-to-day care of patients with cancer.",

Although both SARS and MERS largely pre-dated targeted therapies and ICI, there are a few studies specifically investigating the effect of chemotherapy during these times. For example, Chen et al. reported that of a cohort of 79 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, none of them were documented to have contracted SARS, five were possible cases (proven negative) and during that time only ten of 373 chemotherapy sessions were delayed.7",
