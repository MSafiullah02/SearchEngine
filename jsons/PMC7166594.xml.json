When we look at hPIV types among ARI patients (group 2), we found a significant number of hPIV2 cases (Table 1). This finding could suggest that hPIV2 is associated with mild symptoms; in this sense, previous reports have shown that symptoms such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia are common among children infected with hPIV1 and 3, while croup is more common in children with hPIV2 infection.15\n",

Nevertheless, cases of respiratory virus coinfection are occasionally observed, mainly during influenza seasons (unpublished data). In this sense, further studies about coinfection of hPIV and other viruses could contribute to understanding the course of the disease. In fact, studies on the association between hPIV and mortality are scarce. Though morbidity due to hPIV is low in developed countries, occurring occasionally in newborns, the elderly, or immunocompromised people,1 hPIV infection in adults has been shown to be associated with higher mortality and longer hospitalization when compared with influenza virus infection, and patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases were particularly at risk.42 In the present study, 2.43% of the patients infected with hPIV died; when only hospitalized patients with SARI are considered, the mortality rate for hPIV infection increases to 4.57% and occurs mainly in children and elderly people with underlying diseases, such as cardiovascular and/or pneumopathy; of note, these comorbidities increase the risk to virus infection, including influenza infection.9 In England and Wales,43 it has been estimated that three deaths occur per year due to infection by hPIV2 in children up to 1\u2010year old. In addition, hPIV has also been associated with mortality and a greater impact in the elderly above 75 years.44 In our study, we found a higher fatality rate among patients infected with hPIV2 (22.22%) compared to hPIV1 and 3 (8.57% and 2.74%, respectively), mainly in young infants and in the elderly hospitalized with SARI.",

Nevertheless, we were able to detect a significant number of hPIV\u2010positive cases, which reinforces the need for implementing molecular diagnostics for the respiratory virus in our region. As a matter of fact, as part of the improvement of epidemiological surveillance network in Brazil, a respiratory viruses panel to be used in multiplex\u2010PCR is being implemented in some of the reference laboratories in the country, which will include IAV, IBV, hAdV, hPIVs, RSV, human metapneumovirus, human Bocavirus, human coronavirus, and rhinovirus.",
