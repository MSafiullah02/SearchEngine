            "text": "The \u00d4Livestock Revolution\u00d5 and globalization with enormous increases in free trade of animals and food products are not a choice but a reality (Thiermann, J. Vet. Med. Educ., 28, 2001, 56). Conditions of modern life, some of them related to or being the result of globalization, ensure that factors responsible for disease emergence are more prevalent than ever. Categorization of the factors is somewhat arbitrary but are representative of the underlying processes that cause emergence. Major responsible factors include ecological changes, such as changes due to agriculture or economic development or to anomalies in climates, human demographical changes and behaviour, travel and commerce, technology and industry, microbial adaptation and change, and the breakdown of public health measures (Morse, Emerg. Infect. Dis., 1, 1995, 7). Furtheron, concerning pathogens, their most striking feature emerging and re-emerging is their diversity, ranging from viruses and prions, over bacteria and rickettsia, fungi, protozoa to helminths. As presently the epidemiological perspective does not permit reliable prediction and prevention of most damaging new pathogens, and as the evolutionary perspective only provides rough theoretical estimates for selective processes in pathogen populations, surveillance and monitoring remain the most important methods to recognize early that \u00d4something has happened\u00d5. In light of the complexity and diversity of likely new emerging diseases, such surveillance may be more broadly targeted and aimed more realistically at early recognition of disease syndromes rather than at identifying microbial diseases. The complex and rapid-paced development of international trade, coupled with increasing societal demands for not only abundant and inexpensive food as well as for protection from diseases originating from animals, demands immediate attention from the veterinary community. The inter-relationship at the minimum between animal production, animal diseases and human diseases demands that we consider our concepts, methods and structures. There exists a huge growth area for the veterinary profession; substantial need exists for trained individuals who understand the science of foreign diseases, who can facilitate emergency management operations against diseases (Brown, J. Vet. Med. Educ., 30, 2003, 112) and who can contribute to adjust and strategically develop animal production systems further.",

            "text": "During the past 25 years, the quantity of meat consumed in developing countries grew three times as much as in developed countries. This trend is forcasted to continue; it is estimated that demand for meat and milk products will double over the next two decades in the developing world. Delgado et al. (1999) estimate the annual demand for meat in the developing world to grow from 111 million tons in 1997 to 213 million tons in 2020. Over the same period, milk consumption would grow from 194 million tons to 324 million tons per year in the developing world. This demand-driven increase in animal agriculture, termed \u00d4Livestock Revolution\u00d5 (Delgado et al., 1999) will have to come from expanding intensive rearing systems in the developing world. The sector will shift from a resource (feed availability) driven system to a demand driven system, from a roughage based system to a cereal based system; livestock will loose much of its multi-functionality, and will be mainly kept for meat and milk (De Haan, 2001) . The Livestock Revolution might crowd out a large number of smallholder livestock keepers, thus eliminating one of the most powerful approaches to rural poverty reduction for more than 600 million rural poor. The crowding out is already occurring in many middle-income countries, where there is a strong concentration of production and processing (De Haan, 2001) . Intensified or even industrialized production implies that agriculture is decoupled from the surrounding natural environment; systems are characterized by integration of input supply, food commodity production, processing and marketing. Monogastric animals (pigs and poultry) will be the most important source of growth; monogastric animals have a better concentrate feed conversion than ruminant animals; their production technology further is more universal and thus more amenable to large-scale operations.",

By 2020, they may account for 80% of the world's population but two-thirds of direct consumption of meat and 60% of milk consumption.

From the 3237 existing livestock breeds in 1992, 617 breeds have become extinct since 1982, another 474 breeds are considered to be rare and endangered (Cip-Upward, 2003) . It is suggested that within a period of 100 years about 28% of livestock breed withered, became extinct or rare or endangered. Extreme examples are that almost all pigs reared under commercial farming systems in Europe and North America belong to only two or three breeds. Ninety per cent of all North American dairy cattle and 60% of all European cattle belong to only one breed, the Holstein. Organized poultry farming across the world relies on a few multinational companies who have developed a handful of breeds for their supply of stock (Tisdell, 2001) . Such narrow genetic bases pose many inherent dangers. A narrow genetic base selected for a particular favourable production trait may be unsuitable to, for example, emerging disease problems and changes in climates (environmental tolerance).",

Multifunctionality, organic farming and sustainable agriculture rather are seen as foundations for the European model of agriculture as a whole (Be\u00b4ranger, 2000) . Doubts exist whether this model of agriculture of affluent countries with surplus production of foods can be taken particularly for developing countries with shortages of foods and very few alternatives to agricultural products to enter international markets. Intensive production for these countries in the short term successfully meets demands of populations for food products at economic prices. The hidden costs of such systems like demanding huge feed imports, environmental degradation and concerns over animal welfare present all involved in animal production, processing and marketing with a plethora of interlinked problems and challenges of far-ranging significance. If this intensification is to be sustained or further increased, it will need mechanisms for effective coordination and collaboration at the international level. The foundation and chances for any success will lie in the availability of policies that are realistic and respected by all and not unduly influenced by one-sided and short-sighted economic interests. Realistically, crowding of animals into intensive units coupled with a further rise in international trade for some time will continue to exacerbate risks of new emerging diseases, food borne diseases and zoonoses.",

Epidemiologists try to assess these complex situations by using e.g. probability theory. Probability estimates change with increasing information; they tell us whether something will happen. Possibility estimates on the other hand tell us whether something can happen. Usually, when the possibility of an event is decreased, so is its probability but the reverse is not necessarily true. An event that is impossible will have a zero probability. However, if an event is improbable, it still could be 100% possible. Concerning public health risks, because no information at all or only scanty information is available, not even preliminary probability estimates can be used; it is impossible to predict the next infectious disease to emerge, and it is impossible to predict the source or risk factors involved. It only is most possible that a new infectious disease will emerge some time somewhere.",
