Since neither clinical nor radiological characteristics allow a precise diagnosis, differentiating viral from bacterial pneumonia is challenging and relies upon diagnostic microbiology [3].",

An exception is represented by influenza viruses, whose detection usually indicates a clinical disease, and for which a specific therapy is currently available [6]. In fact, the only medications approved for viral pneumonia in adults are those active against influenza, namely neuraminidase inhibitors. In this scenario, the use of rapid detection methods for influenza may help to rapidly decide whether to initiate or discontinue antiviral therapy, and are indicated for every adult patient with suspected or confirmed influenza requiring hospitalization, with or without CAP [8].",

At the moment, IDSA strongly recommends to start a standard antibacterial therapy for adults with clinical and radiographic evidence of CAP who tested positive for influenza and to re-evaluate after 48\u201372 h for an early discontinuation in selected cases [8]. Most clinicians in their daily clinical practice seemed to follow this behavior, as reported in the paper of Tatarelli et al. [7], where days of hospital antibiotic-therapy were similar in viral and bacterial infections. In this context, serum biomarkers such as procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 have been proposed to support clinicians in antibiotic prescription.",
