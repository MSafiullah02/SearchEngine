The number of licensed antiviral drugs that can be used for the treatment of highly pathogenic RNA virus infections is very limited. These are for influenza, the M2 channel inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine, and the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir. Ribavirin is licensed for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections and is also being used for the treatment of Lassa fever. There is thus an unmet need for potent inhibitors of RNA virus replication, which should have as broad a spectrum as possible. Here we will first discuss the use of licensed antiviral drugs for the treatment of infections caused by highly pathogenic RNA viruses. Next, we provide a (non-exhaustive) review of potential targets for inhibiting the replication of RNA viruses.",

This compound blocks the migration of H+ ions via the viral M2 ion channel into the interior of the virus particles residing in the endosomes (Davies et al., 1964). Acidification of the interior of the viral particle results in destabilization of the capsid and results in uncoating; amantadine prevents this acidification process and thus uncoating (Horimoto and Kawaoka, 2005, De Clercq, 2006). M2 channel inhibitors are, however, only effective against influenza A strains and resistance against the drugs develops readily (Monto, 2003). In recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in the prevalence of amantadine-resistant influenza virus strains (both seasonal influenza and H5N1 avian influenza). The extensive use of amantadine in poultry farms in Asia may be one of reasons of the high amantadine-resistance incidence (Bright et al., 2005, He et al., 2008).",

After budding from the host cell, the viral hemagglutinin interacts with the host cell receptor (a glycoprotein) bearing N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA). The neuraminidase cleaves off NANA from the cell-surface glycoprotein at a specific bond, the sialic acid linked to galactose by an alfa 2,3 or alfa 2,6 linkage. This enables the progeny virus to leave the infected cells and to spread to other host cells. Inhibition of the neuraminidase prevents virus release and thus spread of the virus (Moscona, 2005a, Moscona, 2005b).",

This provided the influenza inhibitors DANA (2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid, Fig. 2A) and FANA (2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-N-trifluoroacetylneuraminic acid, Fig. 2B) and further rational design led to the development of the neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir (Fig. 2C) and oseltamivir (Fig. 2D) (von Itzstein et al., 1993, Kim et al., 1997). Both compounds are highly potent inhibitors of the influenza neuraminidase and influenza A and B virus replication in vitro and in vivo (mice, ferrets). They are both prophylactically and therapeutically effective against influenza in humans (reviewed by De Clercq, 2006). The H274Y mutation may engender resistance of both influenza A H1N1 and influenza A H5N1 to oseltamivir but not zanamivir. In both H5N1 and H1N1 neuraminidases, tyrosine at position 252 is involved in a network of hydrogen bonds, with histidine at position 274 (Russell et al., 2006).",

The development of peramivir is supported by the US Department of Health and Human Services (http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2007pres/20070104.html). An injectable version of peramivir is being developed, as is also the case for zanamivir (see also Beigel and Bray, 2008). The availability of an injectable neuraminidase inhibitor may be an important asset in treating patients hospitalized with severe and potentially life-threatening influenza; an injectable formulation may ensure appropriate dosing which may be a concern with oral or inhaled anti-influenza agents.",

Overall, ribavirin is not very potent as an antiviral drug, and 50% effective concentrations (EC50) values are mostly (well above) 1 \u03bcM. In particular the replication of RSV is relatively efficiently inhibited by ribavirin; other viruses such as several picorna- flavi-, and filoviridae are less susceptible to the drug. Ribavirin was reported to inhibit the replication of several arenaviruses, including Lassa virus in cell culture (Huggins et al., 1984, McKee et al., 1988, Andrei and De Clercq, 1990, Gunther et al., 2004) and has beneficial effects in experimental animal models of Lassa fever (Stephen and Jahrling, 1979, Jahrling et al., 1980, Dvoretskaia et al., 1991). In vitro antiviral activity of ribavirin has also been demonstrated against bunyaviruses including CCHF virus, Rift Valley fever virus and hantaviruses (Watts et al., 1989, Huggins, 1989, Severson et al., 2003). Ribavirin inhibits the replication of coronavirus, including the SARS-coronavirus (Saijo et al., 2005, Barnard et al., 2006) and flaviviruses (Neyts et al., 1996) but has not shown efficacy in experimental infections in animals with these viruses. Likewise, ribavirin is not effective in animal models of filovirus infections (Huggins, 1989). Like other paramyxoviruses such as RSV, Nipah virus is relatively sensitive to ribavirin in cell culture and limited efficacy of the compound has been demonstrated in animal models (Snell, 2004, Georges-Courbot et al., 2006). Ribavirin has also been shown to inhibit the in vitro replication of alphaviruses such as Chikungunya and equine encephalitis viruses (Briolant et al., 2004, Markland et al., 2000).",

Inosine 5\u2032-monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase, a cellular enzyme that converts IMP to xanthosine 5\u2032-monophosphate in the de novo synthesis pathway of guanosine 5\u2032-monophosphate (GMP), is inhibited by ribavirin 5\u2032-monophosphate (Streeter et al., 1973) (Fig. 4\n). The subsequent depletion of intracellular GTP-pools compromises the supply of this nucleotide for the synthesis of progeny viral RNA. This mechanism provided a reasonable explanation for the broad-spectrum anti-RNA virus activity of ribavirin (Streeter et al., 1973). Ribavirin-resistant Sindbis virus was shown to carry mutations in the viral guanylyltransferase gene. This is in line with the observation that drug-resistant Sindbis virus replicates relatively efficiently in cells with low intracellular GTP concentrations, either induced by ribavirin or by other IMP dehydrogenase inhibitors (Malinoski and Stollar, 1981, Scheidel and Stollar, 1991).",

The poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was shown to incorporate ribavirin opposite to cytidine and uridine in the growing RNA chain (Crotty et al., 2000) and poliovirus, that was cultured in the presence of high concentrations of ribavirin (1 mM), accumulated 10-fold more mutations in its genome than virus grown in untreated cultures. The accumulation of mutations in the viral genome results in a process called error catastrophe (Crotty et al., 2001). A single mutation (G64S) in the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene was found to increase the enzyme's fidelity and to render the virus less susceptible to the mutagenic effect of ribavirin (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard, 2003). Error catastrophe has also been proposed to be involved in the antiviral activity of ribavirin against Hantaan virus replication (Severson et al., 2003) as well as the replication of foot-and-mouth disease virus (Airaksinen et al., 2003) and GB virus B virus (Lanford et al., 2001).",

Intravenously administrated ribavirin appears to be more efficacious than when the drug is given orally, which is likely related to the fact that plasma concentrations reached following oral dosing are lower. For the treatment of Lassa fever, ribavirin is effective when given in the early stages of the course of the disease, but reduced or no efficacy was noted if ribavirin was given in the late stages of the disease (McCormick et al., 1986, Schmitz et al., 2002). The drug has also been used as post-exposure prophylaxis, but there are no published data to support this use.

The lack of activity may be related to the phase of infection and severity of the disease; which may call for early intervention (see Jonsson et al., 2008). HPS is to a large extent an immunopathological syndrome; thus even the most effective antiviral may be of little utility without controlling the deleterious host response that is in full-force at the time patients seek medical attention.",

The mechanism by which ribavirin inhibits viral replication varies with the virus studied and can be considered as not very selective (GTP depletion, error catastrophe, etc.). The design of safe and more potent analogues of ribavirin with broad-spectrum activity that can be used in the treatment of a variety of RNA virus infections will therefore likely be very difficult to achieve. EICAR, the 5-ethynyl analogue of ribavirin (Fig. 3E) was shown to be in vitro roughly 10- to 30-fold more potent in inhibiting the replication of various RNA viruses (Leyssen et al., 2005). However, this improved activity came at the price of a concomitant increase in toxicity; which is explained by the fact that the 5\u2032-monophosphate metabolite of EICAR is also more potent than ribavirin monophosphate in inhibiting the IMP dehydrogenase (Balzarini et al., 1993).",

Peptides derived from the F protein (the HRN and HRC regions) that interfere with fusion intermediates of F are candidate molecules for impeding virus entry. Fusion peptides derived from human parainfluenza or Hendra virus were shown to inhibit Hendra virus replication in vitro (Porotto et al., 2006). A similar strategy would also be amenable for coronaviruses (Yan et al., 2006). The ability of peptides that interfere with the class I fusion process has led to the creation of a clinically effective peptide inhibitor of HIV-1 fusion (enfuvirtide, T-20, Fig. 8\n) and related molecules (Dwyer et al., 2007). The efficacy of T-20 as a therapy for HIV-1 infection supports the concept of designing effective therapies based on understanding the mechanism of viral fusion and the use of peptides as antivirals.",

Because of cardiotoxicity in experimental models, the development of this compound was discontinued. However, other HCV NS3 protease inhibitors were developed and excellent efficacy has been demonstrated in the clinical setting, the most advanced is VX-950 (Fig. 9B, De Francesco and Migliaccio, 2005, Forestier et al., 2007). The crystal structure of dengue virus NS3 proteases has been solved (Murthy et al., 2000) and the first inhibitors of these enzymes have been reported (Ganesh et al., 2005).",

Ruprintrivir (Fig. 10\n) is an irreversible 3C protease inhibitor, which upon intranasal administration in human volunteers, appeared to be safe and well tolerated. In experimentally induced rhinovirus colds in healthy volunteers, prophylaxis with the drug reduced the proportion of subjects with positive viral cultures but did not reduce the frequency of colds (Binford et al., 2005, Binford et al., 2007). An analogue of ruprintrivir with excellent oral bioavailability was developed; the compound appeared safe in phase I studies, but has not further progressed toward clinical development (Patick et al., 2005, Patick, 2006). The crystal structures for the main protease (Mpro) of human coronavirus was determined; this revealed a remarkable degree of conservation with the substrate-binding sites of the picornavirus 3C protease. Molecular modeling suggests that ruprintrivir and analogues may be modified to make them efficient inhibitors of coronavirus (such as SARS-coronavirus) replication (Anand et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2005).",

As in the case for the HIV reverse transcriptase, these compounds can largely been classified as nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors. Nucleoside analogues need to be phosphorylated to their 5\u2032-triphosphate metabolite to inhibit the function of the enzyme at the active site. Non-nucleoside analogues act as allosteric site inhibitors. Several nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors are, or have been, in clinical development for the treatment of infection with HCV (De Francesco and Migliaccio, 2005). The nucleoside HCV inhibitors 2\u2032-C-methylcytidine (Fig. 11A), 2\u2032-C-methyl-7-deazaguanosine (Fig. 11B) and related 2\u2032-C-methyl nucleosides exert broad-spectrum activity against single plus-stranded RNA viruses, including activity against the picornavirus foot-and-mouth disease virus (Goris et al., 2007). Other nucleoside inhibitors of HCV replication, such as 4\u2032-azidocytidine (Fig. 11C), a drug that is being developed by Roche, is solely active against HCV (Klumpp et al., 2006 and our unpublished findings). As for HCV, it is also possible to develop highly selective non-nucleoside inhibitors of the polymerase of other RNA viruses, as demonstrated for example with pestiviruses (Baginski et al., 2000, Paeshuyse et al., 2006b, Paeshuyse et al., 2007). Thus, developing potent non-nucleoside inhibitors of related viruses such as other members of the Flaviviridae or the highly pathogenic agents covered in this issue, may well be feasible.",

A polymerase inhibitor can be expected to have a resistance profile that does not overlap with those of the neuraminidase or M2 inhibitors. According to a comparative study, T-705 would even be more potent than oseltamivir when increasing the multiplicity of infection (in vitro) or using a higher virus challenge dose (in vivo) (Takahashi et al., 2003). Against avian influenza A (H5N1), T-705 was found to be less effective than oseltamivir in cell culture, but more effective than ribavirin (Sidwell et al., 2007). T-705 proved also to be effective, when administered orally, against a lethal avian influenza A virus infection in mice (Sidwell et al., 2007). It has been postulated that T-705 is converted intracellularly to the ribonucleotide T-705-ribofuranosyl-5\u2032-monophosphate (T-705 RMP) by a phosphoribosyl transferase, and, upon phosphorylation to its 5\u2032-triphosphate, T-705 RTP would inhibit influenza virus RNA polymerase in a GTP-competitive manner (Furuta et al., 2005, Fig. 13\n). Unlike ribavirin 5\u2032-monophosphate, T-705 RMP does not significantly inhibit IMP dehydrogenase, indicating that it may owe its anti-influenza virus activity mainly, if not exclusively, to inhibition of the influenza virus RNA polymerase.",

It may be assumed that the mechanism by which T-705 inhibits the replication of bunya- and arenaviruses, is similar to the mechanism by which it presumably inhibits influenza replication, that is inhibition of the viral polymerases by T-705-ribofuranosyl-5\u2032-triphosphate.",

Inhibitors of both functions have been described, but have so far not been further developed (Frick, 2007, Borowski et al., 2007, Ujjinamatada et al., 2007). We recently identified a class of thiazolobenzimidazoles (Fig. 14\n) as potent inhibitors of the replication of various enteroviruses (De Palma et al., 2007). Mechanistic studies indicate that the compounds target the picornavirus 2C gene product, which has been predicted to be a helicase/NTPase. Coxsackie virus 2C was expressed and shown to have functional NTPase activity, that, however, was not inhibited by this class of compounds (De Palma et al., accepted for publication). Nevertheless, our unpublished data suggest that the thiazolibenzimidazoles might interfere with the assembly/functioning of the viral helicase. The helicase can be considered as a valuable but yet largely unexplored target for antiviral therapy.",

The clinical efficacy of Debio-025 in the treatment of HCV infections supports the concept that molecules that prevent crucial interactions between viral and cellular factors may be interesting antiviral agents.

In fact, when administered as a single dose of 1 mg/kg on the first or second day after an Ebola Zaire virus infection in mice, 3-deazaneplanocin A reduced peak viremia by more than 1000-fold compared with mock-treated controls, and most or all of the animals survived (Bray et al., 2000). This protective effect was accompanied, and probably mediated, by the production of high concentration of IFN-\u03b1 in the Ebola virus-infected mice (Bray et al., 2002). It could be postulated that by blocking the 5\u2032-capping of the nascent viral (+)RNA strands, of which the maturation is dependent on methylation (Fig. 20\n), 3-deazaneplanocin A prevented the dissociation of these strands from the viral (\u2212)RNA genome, thereby leading to an accumulation of replicative intermediates. These replicative intermediates (containing double-stranded RNA stretches) could, according to the concept proposed many years ago (Carter and De Clercq, 1974), be implicated in the high-level production of interferon.",

C-Cyd was first described as an anti-influenza virus agent (Shannon et al., 1981), but it has also shown activity against DNA viruses [poxviruses (vaccinia)], (+)RNA viruses [togaviruses (Sindbis, Semliki forest)], (\u2212)RNA viruses [orthomyxoviruses (influenza), paramyxoviruses (parainfluenza, measles), rhabdoviruses (vesicular stomatitis)] and dsRNA viruses (reovirus) (De Clercq et al., 1990). Ce-Cyd is a more potent antiviral agent than its counterpart, C-Cyd, and, in addition, it has also proved active against picornaviruses (poliovirus, Coxsackie B, rhinovirus) and herpesviruses (De Clercq et al., 1991). The antiviral activity spectrum of Ce-Cyd extends to bunyaviruses (Punta Toro), flaviviruses (Japanese encephalitis) and arenaviruses (Junin, Tacaribe) (Marquez et al., 1988, Andrei and De Clercq, 1990). For both the antitumor and antiviral effects of C-Cyd and Ce-Cyd, the putative target is assumed to be CTP synthetase, the enzyme that catalyses the conversion of UTP to CTP, which is the final step in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. The fact that both the antiviral and cytotoxic effect of C-Cyd and Ce-Cyd are readily reversed by cytidine and, to a lesser extent, by uridine, but not at all by other nucleosides, such as 2\u2032-deoxythymidine or 2\u2032-deoxycytidine, supports this hypothesis.",

Many other (potential) interesting targets have remained unexplored. Concerted efforts of dedicated laboratories acting in international networks, such as the VIZIER network, described by Coutard et al. (this issue), that study the structural genomics of enzymes involved in RNA virus replication may be instrumental in identifying novel antiviral strategies to inhibit RNA virus resplication. For example, it may be assumed that the strictly regulated nuclear import of the eight influenza RNA segments or the encapsidation of one single copy of each of these RNA segment into the progeny viral particles, may represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention (Greber and Fornerod, 2005). Although it is technically feasible to develop drugs for the treatment of various families or genera of RNA viruses (for example flaviviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, picornaviruses, etc.), the pharmaceutical industry is unlikely to develop antivirals for diseases for which the market is too small or uncertain. Ideally, antiviral drugs should be developed that exert broad-spectrum anti-RNA virus activity. The fact that the influenza polymerase inhibitor T-705 also inhibits the replication of other RNA viruses (Gowen et al., 2007) and that 2\u2032-C-methyl nucleoside analogue inhibitors of the HCV RdRp inhibit also the replication of various other (+)ssRNA viruses, suggest that nucleoside polymerase inhibitors may likely to be broad-spectrum antiviral drug candidates. If such drugs were to be licensed for the treatment of such frequent infections as influenza or HCV, they could eventually be used \u201coff-label\u201d, or on a compassionate basis, for the treatment of other important, but less common infections with highly pathogenic RNA viruses.",
