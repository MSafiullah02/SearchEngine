            "text": "Respiratory viral infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality globally (Esposito et al., 2013, Huijskens et al., 2013). Early identification of respiratory pathogens permits rapid implementation of appropriate infection control precautions, decreased antibiotic use and where appropriate, initiation of antiviral therapies (Barenfanger et al., 2000, Heinonen et al., 2011). Traditional laboratory methods such as viral culture and direct fluorescent-antibody testing are time consuming and lack sensitivity, and are no longer the method of choice (Gharabaghi et al., 2011, She et al., 2010). Currently, molecular methods are now standard and are employed in most virology laboratories. Multiplexed assays have enabled the detection of several viral targets and permit the simultaneous identification of co-infections in patient specimens (Esper et al., 2011). There are currently several multiplex assays available commercially. Three such Health Canada approved assays include the Seeplex RV15 ACE Detection Kit (RV15) (Seegene, South Korea), the Anyplex II RV16 (RV16) (Seegene, South Korea) and the xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (xTAG) (Luminex, United States)",

During the heating period, fluorescence (F) and Temperature (T) were measured continuously.

As the RV15 is an earlier generation assay, one may have expected it to perform less effectively than its comparators in this study. In addition to this, the effect of a freeze-thaw cycle on samples done on the RV16 and xTag for virus detection and accuracy was not analyzed and is a limitation of this study. Sample input among the three assays also varied, with an input of 400 \u03bcL for xTAG and 700 \u03bcL for RV15 and RV16 respectively. There were no issues identified between the assays using the MS2 internal controls, and based on the results obtained from this study, alterations in sample input do not affect sensitivity of the assays. However, a lower sample input may be beneficial if patient sample volumes are limited. In this respect the xTAG assay may be more favorable.",

Ultimately, the ease of use, time to completion and cost of consumable materials will dictate which test methodology is preferable. Following this study, the RV16 replaced the RV15 in house, as the RV16 did not have any inconclusive results. There are however also many other commercial multiplex assays on the market. Some examples include FTD Respiratory (Fast-track diagnostics), EP Respiratory (Ausdiagnostics), FilmArray Respiratory Panel (Biofire Diagnostics/Biomerieux), Verigene\u00ae RV test (Nanosphere) and Prodesse Respiratory assay (Hologic/Gen-Probe) that have in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) indications by various licensing bodies (i.e. FDA, Health Canada, CE). Choosing an assay may be influenced by which jurisdiction it has approval for IVD. In conclusion, the RV16 was implemented in the laboratory because the inconclusive results previously obtained by the RV15 were resolved with the RV16 next generation platform. The RV16 platform also improved workflow compared to the RV15 gel-based detection to RT-PCR, which was deemed easier to interpret.",
