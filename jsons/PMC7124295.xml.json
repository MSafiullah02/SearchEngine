            "text": "Countries and cities have started to launch and implement green building schemes and policies that centered upon a building rating or assessment system, a tool that rates the performance of a building according to a specified set of criteria that usually covers site, water, material, energy and indoor environment quality and other attributes of sustainable design. Aiming to identify priorities for sustainable design, to frame environmental information, and to create a body of information about the impacts of buildings on the environment, the green building assessment systems are a type of indicators revealing key characteristics of important subsystems and elements of concern. As shown in Fig. 1\n, the green building rating systems usually cover from global environmental impacts to indoor impacts (Burnett, 2007). In recent years, these systems are expanding to assess neighborhoods, communities and cities (Sharifi & Murayama, 2013). Understanding the green building rating systems is of great importance for urban planning and design (Retzlaff, 2008). Buildings are an important part of the sustainable development and their environmental, economic and social impacts on cities are obvious. Although the environmental concern in urban planning is being given increasing attention, it remains secondary to economic and social priorities. Green building assessment systems rank environmental performance relative to typical practices, design codes, planning and engineering standards. Thus these rating systems can provide evidence for planning or policy system to judge the sustainability of buildings and to reduce the chance of arbitrary decisions (Yudelson, 2008).",

Since then, there had been a rapid increase in the number of methods throughout the world and a corresponding increase in research on building assessment systems. Some renown assessment methods or tools are U.S. Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Hong Kong Building Environmental Assessment Method Plus (BEAM Plus, formally known as HK-BEAM), Japan Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE), and China Green Building Label (GBL). The existence of the wide variety of building assessment systems provides evidence that no single system has emerged as the green building industry standard in the world (Cole, 2006). Benefits may come from the existence of so many different systems; for instance, multiple systems in practice in the same country can act as a driver for innovation. However, they might also confuse the market by sending mixed messages, and they require design professionals to be familiarized with multiple assessment methods. Furthermore, duplication and overlap among various systems and a lack of transparency and implicit assumptions can make choosing among the various systems difficult and costly (Cole, 2006).",

Early adaptation of building assessment systems to local and regional conditions was addressed in 1998 at the Green Building Challenge Conference (Cole, 1999). Several considerations for adaptation were proposed, for example, assessing building energy consumptions relative to standard local codes and usage and rewarding higher levels of performance on water or materials in specific regions where these resources are lacking or unavailable. A tendency of re-developing green building rating systems was seeking more opportunities for locally developed weighting especially in those developing countries where advanced building assessment tools were absent. For example, a hypothesis-based study has been conducted using LEED as a reference, to measure green performance of Qatari buildings in accordance to the current needs of Qatar and its future plan (Ibrahim, 2012). BREEAM, LEED and CASBEE were considered as a starting point for the development of an effective environmental assessment method intended for the establishment of environmental assessment method suited to Saudi Arabia (Alyami & Rezgui, 2012).",

They also provide access to third-party reviewers so localities do not need to review and certify the green achievements. Adaptation of international and national building assessment systems to local contexts, therefore, is a cost-effective way for cities or regions to implement green building programs if they do not have developed a system, or to underpin current green building policies if the market is accommodating for co-existence of different systems.",

However, these categories are weighed differently according to their priorities and these credits are technically different. LEED highlights public transport and low emitting vehicles, and energy and water reductions. In U.S., 28.1% of total carbon emissions come from the transportation (USGBC, 2009). Huge private car ownership and low density highlight the significance of public transport to designing a green building. However, this is less significant in Hong Kong (Hui and Yu, 2013) where over 90% of the daily journeys are on public transport, making it the highest rate in the world (Lam, 2003).While in Hong Kong, public health and ventilation attract more attention since SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) (Wong et al., 2009). Correspondingly, BEAM Plus underscores an efficient and healthy building for users. In China, green building development is deeply related to national policies such as the \u201celeventh five-year plan\u201d which advocated a society of \u201csaving\u201d. Thereby, \u201csaving\u201d is the key word of the China green building label: saving land, energy, material and water. In sum, the three systems share similar categories that embody universal consensus on a green building.

The three systems have different quantitative requirements for these aspects. For example, in the aspect of connectivity to basic services, LEED requires 10 services within 805 m; GBL requires 8 within 500 m; BEAM Plus requires 10 within 500 m.

Efficient landscaping by using adaptive plants or rainwater for irrigation is a significant part for water saving strategies in these tools. The three tools identify different baselines for calculation of water consumptions. For example, LEED sets 6 L per flush for toilets; while the default values in GBL and BEAM Plus are 6.6 L per flush and 7.5 L per flush, respectively.

For example, LEED uses ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers) standards; GBL uses national standards for different climates in China (such as Hot-summer and Cold-winter, Hot-summer and Warm-winter, and Severe Cold and Cold); BEAM Plus uses ASHRAE standards as well as a local standards such as Performance-based Building Energy Code from EMSD (Electrical and Mechanical Services Department). These standards or codes similarly use a baseline to compare proposed design. However, their baselines are quite different, and the credit scales are varying amongst the three rating systems. Through an energy modeling comparison of two office buildings in Shanghai, it is found that the yearly energy saving of the proposed design was approximately 27% from GBL system and 21% from LEED (Pan, Yin, & Huang, 2008). Another comparison study of energy performance requirements across LEED, BREEAM, BEAM Plus, GBL, etc. confirmed that LEED was more stringent in terms of default parameters in comparison with the other systems (Lee, 2012). However, no matter how sophisticated these energy performance ratings, they may be unlikely to reveal actual performance in uses (Gou, Prasad, & Lau, 2014). Therefore, the results should be carefully explained.",

Deficiency of thermal performance of the building envelope showed another cultural difference. Thermal performance of the building envelope is an essential design factor for energy saving in residential buildings.

Case1 had 21 services and Case2 had 26 services within their 500-miter radius. Encouraging non-traditional water use is an important strategy to save potable water use. For Case1, the percentage of non-traditional water use was more than 42%, much higher than the optimal requirement 5%. This is because seawater as a kind of non-traditional water is popularly used in flushing in Hong Kong. According to Water Supplies Department, seawater is used to flush toilets in 79% households in Hong Kong. Obviously, these green features are commonplace in Hong Kong.
