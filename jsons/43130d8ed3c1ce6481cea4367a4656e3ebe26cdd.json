This pioneering declaration was of particular importance given that Nigeria has more child pneumonia deaths than any other country, including India, and progress is very slow in reducing these deaths. In this respect, Nigerian leadership on pneumonia is critical and will be closely observed by many African nations, who face similar challenges. We applaud Nigeria for their leadership in pneumonia control.",
