These days, Malware can be purchased and licensed on the Internet to further customize and deploy. With hundreds of Malware variants discovered every day, organizations and users experience enormous financial losses as cybercriminals steal financial and user data. In this article surveys the human characteristics that are key to the defense chain against Malware. The article starts with the attack models/vectors that humans often fall prey to and their fallouts. Next, analysis of their root cause and suggest preventive measures that may be employed is detailed. The article concludes that while Internet user education, training, awareness can reduce the chances of Malware attacks, it cannot entirely eliminate them.",

Many other under-developed countries are moving in the developing world, and this shift is bound to bring in more new Internet users. User ignorance not only results in their exploitation but also dramatically impacts other users within social networks or the organization. The curiosity character of a user leads them to explore the Internet without care, thereby exposing them to attack vectors. Although a large proportion of Internet users are aware of the possible Malware exploits, they seem to forget their warnings and lower their guard by trusting websites and URLs (hyperlinks). McAfee Labs researchers documented a record number of Malware samples in 2019 targeting Mobiles, Mac systems, Linux, IoT, Bitcoins, JavaScript, Internet, and Macros [1]. User awareness regarding Malware security concerns is critical but can only spread gradually. Therefore social networks, Internet Service providers, online search engines should be proactive and develop more sophisticated and stringent mechanisms to thwart Malware infections. Safe and secure transmission of online information and robust users privacy should be the paramount concern of all players on the Internet. The objective of this paper is to outline the vulnerable role that humans play in the fight against Malware and identify areas for improvement. The author uses multiple approaches to document reasons for human victimization by Malware attacks.",

Figure 1 shows statistical a significant difference between men and women regarding risk averseness scale (p=0.003) and a borderline significance on privacy concerns scale (p=0.049). Internet users often trust online information, such as reviews and comments during their decision making [4] . Few factors that establish trustworthiness of a website tend to be related to showcasing the physical (face-to-face) nature of the organization or its customers such as buildings, any public organization reports, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives, user-reviews, employee testimonials, and few pictures of employees in their work place setting. Social media platforms are becoming increasingly popular news sources as they distribute information from various Internet users and numerous media outlets. An online study [5] of 357 Facebook users found that messages from trusted sources were more Fig. 1 . Risk, Privacy and trust with/without Social Networking profiles [3] likely to be propagated irrespective of propensity risk. This suggests that messages(news) can spread irrespective of it being genuinely true or false just by trusting the message source and recipient. In a study of about 126,000 Twitter stories that were tweeted (discussed/shared) 4.5 million times, the authors found that humans, not robots, were more likely to spread false news as it was more novel than true news. This shows that human fascination for the novelty of news was a catalyst for its propagation irrespective of its genuineness being verifiable. Sterrett et al. [6] studied factors such as the trustworthiness of the person who shares a story and the credibility of the news outlet reporting the story. The authors concluded that a source has a limited effect on the sharing of their news stories while the sharer has a strong impact on attitudes towards a story. Such human behavior coupled with current Internet speeds, its reach, minimal verifications, social pressure to contribute/share and the busy lives of Internet users can explain their implicit trust patterns without cross-verifying messages for their truth. Such behavior can also cause them to indiscriminately share messages with links to malicious URLs and Malware laden attachments thereby creating a perfect petri-dish for Malware authors.",

If information can be untrue, it's better to ignore and not absorb it rather than blindly following it. They argue, using both a Bayesian and a non-Bayesian analysis that in some situations, you are better off ignoring information if your uncertainty is represented by a set of probability measures. With the developing countrys population getting increasingly hitched on to the Internet, any false information posted on the Internet can easily spread, causing havoc. Also, the literacy level of the user does not determine if they can distinguish a piece of false information from a true one since they start to trust the Internet more and more. For Instance, not all information on Wikipedia [8] is accurate. Readers should be aware of this and not always trust word for word on online information unless backed by some sort of reputation scores.",

Botnets are the most common vehicle of cyber-criminal activity. They are used for spamming, phishing, denial of service attacks, bruteforce cracking, stealing private information, and cyber warfare. Botnets commonly scan large segments of the Internets address space for various reasons, such as infecting or compromising hosts, recruiting hosts into a botnet, or collating a list of future targets. The website Songsrpeople.com looks a lot like other amateur-video sites with advertisements along with content. But Web-security investigators at White Ops contend that most of the site's visitors aren't people [18] . Rather, they are computer-generated visitors, or \"bots,\" designed to fool advertisers into paying for the traffic. White Ops discovered that more than 30% of the visitors to the education portal Education.com were robots. In the past month, the site received about four million unique views, according to Quantcast [19] .",

Various versions of the Cyber Kill Chain have since been released like the including AT&Ts Internal Cyber Kill Chain Model and the Unified Kill Chain [37]. The step 5 of the \"Cyber Kill Chain\" model explains the \"Installation\" phase wherein the attacker installs Malware on the victim's computer/network. Malware needs a way to spread and achieve its intended goal. The payload is a delivery system that carries the malicious code to the victim. Few known Malware exploit techniques and payloads are outlined below; 1) Adding malicious code to hundreds of thousands of legitimate websites, which then copied Malware to visitors computers 2) Creating hyperlinks in spam messages to specially created sites that infected PCs 3) Fake antivirus software that falsely claimed the PC was infected and urged the user to pay a fee to remove viruses 4) Cryptocurrency miners secretively use the victim's compute power for cryptocurrency mining. 5) Trojans that attempted to steal financial records stored on the PC 6) The ZeroAccess rootkit, which downloaded other software that hijacked the PC for use in a botnet -a facility used to overwhelm websites with traffic and force them offline. 7) Spyware like Key loggers are malicious code that record of what was typed on the PC and then. 8) Ransomware that attempts to blackmail the PC owner into paying a ransom for the release of their computer files. 9) A vulnerability is effectively an error in the code or the logic of operation that has gone unnoticed by the developer or vendor. Vulnerabilities both that of application and Operating System are often the go-to mechanisms by Malware authors. 10) Exploit kits are malicious toolkits with prewritten code that attackers use to search for software vulnerabilities on a targets computer or mobile device. Such toolkits can also be found for sale on the darkweb. Attackers usually use a combination of exploits against different software to gain access to the computer. An exploit detection may be triggered by the user's antivirus software when the user visits a website that contains malicious exploit code -even if the user was not using the vulnerable software being targeted. This does not mean that the user had been compromised. It means that an attempt to compromise the user's computer has been made [38] .",

During these investigations, the FBI relies on their Legal Attachs or legats, who coordinate with other countries law enforcement officials. In countries where the police cooperate with the US authorities and are competent, the FBI is very open to allowing a local prosecution of a criminal. The danger is that without sufficient proven damages, judges in the U.S. can perceive the defendant as a troubled smart kid and let them off with a light sentence. Sentences with high restitution also serve to punish the criminal and help defray the damages that victims suffer. In Malware cases, prison terms average 17 months, and restitution repayments average $100,000 [6] .",

Why privacy matters can be a long discussion, but anyone who values their online privacy should be proactive in safeguarding it. People need to limit sharing their personal information online or on social media as such information can be easily misused by nefarious actors. Companies track user's online behavior across websites to serve relevant advertisements. Internet users should always be watchful about Tracking, Surveillance and Theft of their identity and private data. There are many smart ways to help protect your privacy online such as; 1) Browse in incognito or private mode. Delete Cookies when existing a browser and visit the privacy settings on browsers. 2) Use a search engine that champion privacy. 3) Update and apply patches against your applications, devices and computer whenever updates and patches are released by vendors. If possible, allow for automatic updates and patches. This is different than device \"upgrade\" which may involve cost and can be undertaken at a slower pace. 4) Use a virtual private network. 5) Watch where you click on websites. 6) Secure your mobile devices using strong disk-level encryption if already not done so. 7) Use quality antivirus software. Configure antivirus for automatic updates and scan periodically. 8) Use Firewalls (application or network). 9) Secure home network routers with strong encryption, set strong passwords and frequently recycle passwords. 10) Adjust your social media privacy settings (Facebook, Twitter etc.). 11) Secure your online/cloud storage and use encrypted connections to websites. 12) Securely dispose electronic equipment.",

While users do not want to completely lock themselves out of the Internet world, they need to strike a balance between the careful use of the Internet and safeguarding their privacy. 6 . Securing Code Mashup, Maintenance, and Securing Systems Given the prevalence of client-side code mashups, it is imperative to design a sound approach to enhance the flexibility of the current mashup programming practice with guaranteed security [44] . Since not all the applications on the Internet are well designed and built, coding standards vary by programmers, causing exploits from the Malware authors who specialize in the drawbacks of the programming language or logic. A McAfee report found that more than 90% of Malware attacks with the username/password combination of admin:admin originated from the United States [1]. Such lax security configurations of routers, IoT devices, network systems, etc. should be avoided. A proposed method is for the vendors of such systems to default their system configurations to a strong setting. Alternatively, application/functionality security settings logic should be strictly enforced by vendors to avoid weak configurations. Regular patching and upgrades is always recommended.",

Unfortunately, computer literacy does not bring about smart Internet surfing. With the growing population of new Internet users in the developing world who are not yet very computer savvy, it is easy for Malware authors to use such machines for Botnet attacks. Based on the browsing habits of a user, it would be beneficial to predict and warn if they are prone to Malware attack (high risk). Such commercial and affordable security controls, possibly driven by Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning and Machine Learning, can be valuable in attack prediction. In the smartphone world, with Android security yet to be fully fortified, hundreds of Malware thrive as the common user does not care to install anti-Malware Apps and blindly trust App stores to keep out the malicious Apps. Users, especially in the developing world, where the Internet is fast catching up, do not seem to understand and value their privacy rights. In the developing world, victims seldom report Malware crimes as they do not value their personal data or do not expect any action from the online community or their governmental authorities. This only severely limits the apprehension of Malware criminals but degrades the overall effort of law enforcement to predict and punish Malware authors. User privacy, as seen in the developed world is still not a priority in the developing world. Thus Malware authors capitalize on this gap by catering differently to the developing and developed world. Malware industry adapts and shifts to its needs as in any other criminal industry. With Malware authors being now directed by governments to fight Cybersecurity, it's bound to grow unless netizens realize and educate themselves to safe browsing tactics. While human curiosity may be difficult to curb online, ignorance and trust can be easily treated with periodic awareness and training.",
