While in the emergency department she 68 required oxygen at 6L/min via nasal cannula. The initial chest x-ray demonstrated perihilar 69 opacification. She tested PCR positive for COVID-19 and was subsequently admitted to the ICU 70 for management of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure secondary to acute respiratory distress 71 syndrome (ARDS) and COVID-19. The patient was intubated shortly thereafter due to increasing 75 Approximately 12 days following presentation to the ED, the patient developed gradually 76 worsening duskiness of the right second, third, and fourth fingertips while in the ICU. Notably, 77 the patient had had three arterial line placements on the left side (one radial, two brachial), but 78 none on the right side. The hand service was consulted and the physical examination showed a 79 mottled, dusky appearance to the distal phalanges and nailbeds of the index, middle, and ring 80 fingers. The fingers were also noted to be cool to palpation and Doppler signals were absent at The patient's fibrinogen (486 mg/dL) was also elevated 3 days prior to consultation. 88 89 Based on this presentation, the orthopaedic service recommended the continuation of the 90 patient's 25,000-unit heparin drip at 11 units/kg/hour (previously prescribed empirically 91 secondary to elevated D-dimer and then continued for a right femoral DVT) in addition to duplex 92 studies and thermal warming of the affected limb.
