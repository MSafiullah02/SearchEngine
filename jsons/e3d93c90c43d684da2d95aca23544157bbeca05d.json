Symptomatic subjects included those with URTI (ie, provider documentation or parental report of respiratory symptoms with no or negative pulmonary imaging, including chest radiograph or chest computed tomography) or LRTI (ie, provider documentation or parental report of respiratory symptoms with abnormal pulmonary imaging). All patients had a scheduled HCT date at the time the specimen was obtained, and HCT delay was determined by whether this date was changed and whether this was due to specimen results. Only patients with sole RV detection and virus negative specimens (n = 56) were included in the analysis since the aim was to evaluate outcomes of children with RV. RV-positive and virus negative children were not significantly different in terms of age, gender, or insurance status, but RV-positive children were significantly less likely to be white ( Table 1 ). The majority of children with an immunodeficiency had RV detection, but the difference in underlying disease was not significant overall. Other HCT-related variables, specimen type, and testing platform were not different between the groups. Specimens were obtained a median of 22.0 days (virus negative) and 19.5 days (RV-positive) prior to HCT.

This is a single site study, so findings may not be generalizable to children at other hospitals with different underlying conditions and chemotherapy protocols. Viruses were not sequenced, so subsequent detection could represent acquisition of a new strain rather than continued shedding. However, the high rates of RV detection in subsequent specimens highlight that waiting until RV is no longer detected may not be a feasible option for children who urgently need HCT. Additionally, RV are indistinguishable from enteroviruses on these commercial assays; however, previous data suggest that >95% are RV. 16 We present data related to the outcome of children with RV Further larger studies are needed to determine the optimal management of these patients.",

HCT delay can increase the risk of oncologic relapse and/or mortality, so risks and benefits of HCT delay must be evaluated. This study provides data to suggest that for patients with RV detection without LRTI symptoms, clinicians can consider proceeding with HCT in certain circumstances.The decision of whether and how long to delay HCT in patients with RV detection is complicated by prolonged viral shedding.Almost half of patients with RV detection pre-HCT continued to have RV detection in follow-up testing pre-and post-HCT. Thus, HCT delay until the virus is no longer detected may not be feasible or warranted for patients with high-risk underlying conditions. Our study has limitations, including a small number of patients.However, no studies have focused on RV detection pre-HCT in pediatrics, a unique population due to high rates of viral detection.Data were collected retrospectively, so clinical symptoms are limited by review of medical record documentation. Viral testing was performed at the discretion of the HCT physician. During the included years, practice patterns and decision making regarding interpretation and results of viral cultures and PCR changed over the course of the included years with guidelines published during this period.15",
