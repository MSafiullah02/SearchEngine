Healthy individuals are susceptible to an infection (S), infectious individuals carry and transmit the pathogen regardless of whether they exhibit symptoms (I), and recovered individuals remain unaffected by the disease (R). These recovered individuals are assumed to either have natural immunity or immunity attained by recuperating from the infection [11], [12], [13]. Sometimes individuals lost to the disease are mixed with those who have recovered in which case R stands for removed. Based on the described compartmentalization, the classical Susceptible\u2013Infectious\u2013Removed (SIR) model without spatial dynamics has the following form:(1)dSdt=\u2212\u03b2SI,dIdt=\u03b2SI\u2212\u03b3I,dRdt=\u03b3I, where \u03b2 and \u03b3 are infection and recovery (removal) rates, respectively. The basic reproductive number of system (1) is R0=\u03b2S0/\u03b3, where S0 is the initial number of susceptible individuals. If R0<1, the number of infectious individuals is a decreasing function of time and the disease disappears after a while; otherwise, the disease eventually outbreaks.",

            "text": "\u2022 Infections. An infection is possible if a susceptible and an infectious individual meet and stay in contact for the sufficient amount of time. This possibility is reflected in the contact and transmission rate, \u03b2, which gives the probability of an infection per unit of time spent in contact. The probability of meeting an infectious individual is simply given by the fraction of such individuals in the whole population, i.e. MI/M. The number of new infections is therefore \u03b2MSMI/M. An implicit assumption in the last expression, called the standard incidence rate, is that one susceptible individual meets only one other individual per unit of time who may be infectious with the probability MI/M and susceptible with the remaining probability 1\u2212MI/M. However, one readily envisions a situation in which a large population allows a susceptible individual to make several contacts per unit of time. To account for this possibility, the so-called contact frequency, C(M), can be introduced as a function of the population size. Two functional forms are found in the literature [11], [12], [13]. First, C(M)=\u03b3M leads to an interaction term of the form \u03b2\u2032MSMI (where \u03b2\u2032=\u03b2\u03b3 is a new parameter) called the bilinear incidence rate. In this case, the larger the population, the more contacts a susceptible individual makes. Second, C(M)=M/(\u03b3+\u03b4M) results in the infection term \u03b2\u2032MSMI/(1+\u03b4\u2032M) (where \u03b2\u2032=\u03b2/\u03b3 and \u03b4\u2032=\u03b4/\u03b3 are constants) named the saturated incidence rate. This rate is similar to the bilinear incidence rate if the population is small, but mimics the standard incidence rate (with parameter \u03b2=\u03b2\u2032/\u03b4\u2032) when the population becomes large.",

Spatial patterns have been observed empirically, thus confirming the practical value of modeling the transmission dynamics of diseases in space. For example, Grassly et al. [39] showed evidence of pattern formation in the case of poliovirus in India between 2000 and 2005. The results identified a \u201chot area\u201d for poliovirus (see Fig. 3\n(a)) and, more importantly, helped explain the underlying causes of such a phenomenon.

In this case, the results indicated a transition between stationary patterns due to the changes in local environmental conditions.",

Healthy individuals are susceptible to an infection (S), infectious individuals carry and transmit the disease although they may not exhibit the symptoms yet (I), and removed individuals neither contract nor transmit the disease (R) because they may have natural immunity, may be immune after a recovery, or may have been placed in isolation [11], [12], [65]. Having introduced these three types, we can construct an SIR reaction\u2013diffusion model in the spirit of Eqs. (2) as follows [42]:(5)\u2202S\u2202t=A\u2212dS\u2212\u03b2SpIq+D1\u22072S,\u2202I\u2202t=\u03b2SpIq\u2212(d+\u03bc+\u03b3)I+D2\u22072I,\u2202R\u2202t=\u03b3I\u2212dR+D3\u22072R, where A is the population's recruitment rate, d is the natural mortality rate, \u03bc is the disease-related mortality rate of infectious individuals, and \u03b3 is their recovery rate. The nonlinear incidence rate, \u03b2SpIq, is due to saturation or multiple exposures before an infection occurs, where p and q are phenomenological constants [66], [67]. \u22072=\u22022\u2202X2+\u22022\u2202Y2 is the usual Laplacian operator in two-dimensional space. This type of SIR models is appropriate for the transmission dynamics of infectious disease to which permanent immunity normally develops, such as smallpox [68], [69] and mumps [70], [71]. The transmission processes are demonstrated in the flowchart (see Fig. 4\n).",

Turing's instability requires that the stable, homogeneous steady state is driven unstable by the interplay of reaction and diffusion terms [73]. By assuming the constant total population size, the system (5) becomes two dimensional. Consequently, we consider just the first two equations. For this reduced system, we are interested in the positive equilibrium dented by E\u204e=(S\u204e,I\u204e). We make the following nonuniform perturbations from equilibrium E\u204e\n(6)(SI)=(S\u204eI\u204e)+\u03b5(S\u03baI\u03ba)e\u03bbt+i\u03ba\u2192r\u2192+c.c.+O(\u03b52), where \u03bb is the growth rate of perturbations over time (t), i is imaginary unit, \u03ba\u2192 is the wave vector, r\u2192=(X,Y) is a two-dimensional radius vector in the complex conjugate plane, and c.c. stands for the complex conjugate. After substituting equation (6) into the reduced system, we obtain that stability is dependent on the determinant of matrix A, whereA=(a11\u2212D1\u03ba2\u2212\u03bba12a21a22\u2212D2\u03ba2\u2212\u03bb), with aij (i,j=1,2) being the elements of the Jacobian matrix corresponding to the positive equilibrium E\u204e.",

If \u03b2 increases even further, the striped pattern turns into another spotted pattern.

It is found that relatively small noise intensity favors the appearance of the spotted pattern, where the number of spots reaches a maximum as the noise increases. Increasing the noise even further causes the striped pattern to appear and partly replace the spotted pattern. Somewhat similarly, the number of spots is an increasing function of the temporal correlation until a maximum is reached. Thereafter, spots gradually give way to stipes. Numerical simulations thus indicate that when noise intensity and temporal correlation are both large enough, the stochastic model given by Eq. (10) exhibits a noise-controlled transition from a spotted to a striped pattern. This phenomenon can also be found in other fields, e.g. chemistry [83], biology [84], and physics [85].",

In an epidemiological CA model, space is represented by a network of sites, while the state of each site is updated through probabilistic rules representing stochastic demographic events [47], [88], [89], [90]. Here, we focus on a particular CA model designed to mimic the behavior of an R-D system of equations with susceptible\u2013infectious (SI) interactions [90], [91], thus describing the transmission of infectious diseases from which one cannot recover such as HIV or HBV [92], [93], [94], [95].",

Two basic rules in this CA-SI model are:\u2022\nReactive interaction rule. If the number of susceptible individuals is higher than the number of infectious individuals at given lattice site n, then these infectives turn susceptible with probability \u03c1a such that site n becomes occupied by at most M susceptibles. This lattice site stays unchanged with remaining probability 1\u2212\u03c1a. If the opposite is true and the number of the infectives is higher than the number of the susceptibles, then susceptible individuals turn infectious with probability \u03c1d such that the lattice site has at most M infectives. Again, this site stays unchanged with remaining probability 1\u2212\u03c1d.\u2022\nDiffusion rule. Diffusion of susceptible and infectious individuals is modeled using random walk, whereby each type of individuals moves independently from the other type. This independent movement is achieved in two distinct stages. First, at each lattice site, all individuals are assigned a random velocity direction, except for one susceptible and one infectious individual who remain stationary, thus guaranteeing that a site never gets empty. Second, all individuals on a lattice move in the direction of their velocities, where the number of steps is given by natural numbers ma and md for susceptible and infectious individuals, respectively. These numbers are analogous to diffusion rates in R-D models. With these rules, in every time moment, each lattice site has at least one susceptible and one infectious individual. The maximum number of both the susceptibles and the infectives per lattice site is M.",

In our CA model, furthermore, the form of the lattice also affects the dynamics when the parameter values are held fixed.

Especially interesting are synchrony and asynchrony, both of which arise as perturbations of the spatially homogeneous (i.e. \u201cflat\u201d), endemic solutions of the model. Synchrony implies a diminishing role of heterogeneity, whereas asynchrony represents a necessary condition for global persistence of a disease even if this disease dies out locally [47], [118], [120], [121], [122]. In this context Hagenaars et al. [120] studied the relationship between spatial heterogeneity and the persistence of an infectious disease in a stochastic SIR meta-population model. This relationship is explained in terms of (i) within-patch persistence, (ii) between-patch transmissions, and (iii) between-patch coherence, whereby if (iii) is negligible, (i) and (ii) constitute what is called the \u201crescue effects\u201d theory. A general finding is that in a symmetric meta-population\u2014usually the one with constant contact rate \u03b2 within patches and another, smaller, contact rate \u03f5\u03b2 between each pair of distinct patches, where 0\u2264\u03f5\u22641 is the coupling strength\u2014increasing the level of spatial heterogeneity shortens disease persistence. Rescue effects largely explain persistence patterns if spatial coupling is weak (i.e. spatial heterogeneity is strong). With non-negligible spatial coupling (i.e. intermediate or weak heterogeneity), coherence and synchronization effects decide the fate of the disease.",

Fig. 10\nfeatures the effects of coupling parameter \u03f5 on the number of infections in a deterministic SIR (left panels) and a stochastic SEIR (right panels) model with n=2 patches. In the deterministic SIR model, the stronger the coupling, the easier to establish synchronization (Fig. 10a, b). In the stochastic SEIR model, by contrast, weak coupling is overpowered by the stochastic effects (Fig. 10c), causing the patches to drift in and out of phase. Stronger coupling, however, cancels out the random effects and forces the system to synchronize (Fig. 10d). Because synchronized systems are equivalent to spatially homogeneous ones, it is important to understand what mechanisms maintain the phase difference between patches. It turns out that seasonal forcing is one such mechanism, whereby in the simplest possible configuration (\u03f5\u21920), the system ends up with either (i) two in-phase patches or (ii) two out-of-phase patches with a one year phase difference. As \u03f5 increases, the basin of attraction for the in-phase solution expands at the expense of the same basin for the out-of-phase solution. Relatively high values of \u03f5 also have the potential to generate chaotic solutions such that the number of infectious individual in both patches exhibits oscillatory behavior with different periodicities and time-dependent amplitudes.",

Can migration cause the extinction of the disease for those parameter values that guarantee persistence in the one-patch model? To answer these questions, the authors examine four situations illustrated in Fig. 11\n; (i) small vs. (ii) high migration rate, both with zero initial density of the infectives in the second patch; (iii) small vs. (iv) high migration rate, both with large initial density of the infectives in the second patch.

An example in this context is the evolution of virulence in host\u2013parasite systems, wherein the distribution of individuals in space may be responsible for the evolution of moderate transmission rates. As Johnson and Boerlijst [123] explain, if selection takes place both at the individual level and the community level, then individual-level selection promotes ever higher transmission rates over a certain region of space, but as these rates approach a critical threshold, the host population becomes overwhelmed and dies out locally, leading also to the local extinction of parasites. The result of the described mechanism is that the landscape self-organizes into patches within which individual-level selection acts to push transmission rates up, yet between which community-level selection operates to keep transmission rates in check. Self-organization disappears with the increased mixing that makes the population more homogeneous.",

However, the same characterization is overly restrictive in some cases, especially when considering childhood diseases such as measles, rubella, and whooping cough [125], [126], which is evidenced by the discrepancies between the empirical data and the model predictions. Using the realistic parameter values, for example, the classic models predict annually recurring whooping cough epidemics, whereas the data in Fig. 12\nshow variable inter-epidemic periods. Accordingly, a question that arises in this context is how to improve the classic models to obtain a better agreement between data and predictions.",

To account for the increased mixing during school terms in a study of childhood diseases, Keeling et al. [125] considered an SIR model with a time-varying contact rate of the form \u03b2(t)=\u03b20(1+\u03b21)Term(t), where \u03b20 is the basic contact rate, \u03b21 is a seasonal correction, and Term(t) is an \u201cindicator\u201d function taking value 1 during school terms and \u22121 during school holidays. The resulting dynamics due to this \u201cdual\u201d nature of the forcing can be understood as switching between two fixed-point spiral sinks (Fig. 13\n), one arising during terms (when \u03b2 is high) and the other during holidays (when \u03b2 is low). This model is capable of producing recurring epidemics with varying periodicity and outbreak amplitude, in accordance with the empirical evidence.",

Accordingly, subsequent developments showed that seasonality in contact rates need not be large to cause disproportionately large oscillations in disease incidence. Dushoff et al. [127], seeking an explanation for the seasonality of influenza, attributed this disproportionate response to dynamical resonance. To that end, the authors studied a relatively simple SIRS epidemic model with the following structure:(15a)dSdt=N\u2212S\u2212IL\u2212\u03b2(t)ISN,\n(15b)dIdt=\u03b2(t)ISN\u2212ID, where N is the total population size (thus N\u2212S\u2212I gives the number of recovered/immune individuals), L is the average duration of immunity, D is the mean infectious period, and \u03b2(t)=\u03b20(1+\u03b21cos\u2061(2\u03c0t)) is the sinusoidally varying contact rate. Fig. 14\nshows the effect of seasonal forcing on oscillating influenza incidence with and without demographic stochasticity. A surprising result here is that large oscillations in incidence, arising due to the dynamical resonance, are sparked by undetectably small seasonal changes in the influenza transmission rate. Indeed, the ratio of the basic contact rate, \u03b20, and the amplitude of the seasonal correction, \u03b21, used in Fig. 14 is as high as 20000:1.",

Increasing \u03b21 beyond a certain threshold changes the model behavior. The number of susceptible, exposed, and infectious individuals develops self-sustained two-year periodic oscillations, the amplitude of which increases with the value of parameter \u03b21. Even higher values of this parameter lead to chaotic behavior and the appearance of irregular spiral waves. This particular spatial pattern (i.e. spiral waves) grows stably, turning more and more prominent over time. Spiral waves are also recurrent and insensitive to changes in the amplitude (\u03b21) of the seasonal correction.",

First, environmental factors that affect daily lives in a rather obvious manner, such as temperature and precipitation, often exhibit seasonal patterns. It is, therefore, only natural that models with seasonal forcings play a prominent role in epidemiological studies. However, the environment is immensely complex and thus more often than not appears random to a researcher who is powerless to account for this complexity. A relatively simple solution allowing the inclusion of environmental randomness (in the broadest sense) into epidemiological models is to resort to stochastic forcing variables. For example, in models of sexually transmitted diseases, a stochastic forcing variable could be the number of sexual partners during a given time interval. A separate issue is that diseases sometimes affect relatively small populations. In these populations, if the population size is below the critical level, non-zoonotic infections cannot persist and eventually die out due to random effects [129], [130]. Finally, it is known that exclusively deterministic approaches sometimes fail to produce even a qualitative fit to the empirical evidence. A good example of such failure is whooping cough in England and Wales [81].",

In dynamical terms, Bartlett's concept is an example of stochastic dynamics in the presence of an absorbing barrier (here, zero population size). One way to emphasize the importance of such a barrier is to consider that deterministic dynamical systems converge towards stable equilibrium points or attractors, whereas stochasticity may compel trajectories away from these attractors. If stochasticity is sufficiently strong, it may cause trajectories to touch the absorbing barrier, giving rise to an extinction probability even if a population is otherwise viable. Therefore, a key issue in shaping the disease dynamics becomes the accurate balance between determinism and stochasticity [81].",

Coulson et al. [131], for example, suggested that whooping cough is an epidemic characterized by \u201cactive\u201d noise, whereby stochasticity interacts with nonlinearity in the deterministic framework to generate patterns that neither factor can generate on its own. Nguyen and Rohani [126], however, reach a somewhat different conclusion upon using household data on incubation times to better parametrize distributions of the latent and infectious periods. These authors give a more \u201cpassive\u201d account of noise, stating that stochasticity influences the transitions between a multitude of deterministic states. Alonso et al. [132] offer yet another perspective on the epidemiology of childhood diseases, ascribing the dynamics to the amplitude of the contact rate seasonal correction and the tendency of dynamical resonance to amplify fluctuations. Especially, childhood diseases turned out to habituate the regions of parameter space in which noise amplification is high. Sim\u00f5es et al. [133] make another step forward by relaxing the random mixing assumption and placing the host population into a \u201csmall-world\u201d network of contacts. The authors find that predominantly local connectedness (i.e. spatial correlation) considerably enhances the amplitude and the coherence of the resonant stochastic fluctuations, the implication being that, if a disease spreads through local infectious contacts, then seasonal forcing is unnecessary to cause large epidemic outbreaks with well-defined periodicity (i.e. internal noise alone is sufficient).",

Examples of behavioral responses vary in range and scope; during the SARS outbreak in 2003, for instance, people reduced movement and wore facial masks out of fear of infection [135]. Similarly, the outbreak of influenza A(H1N1) in 2009 saw not only the implementation of public measures, but also responses at a personal level such as the increased use of sanitizers and the avoidance of major gathering spots [136], [137], [138]. Much attention among the general public was given to the availability of vaccine and the decision whether to get vaccinated or not [139]. Irrespective of the detailed responses to any particular disease, it is important that human behavior has the potential to directly affect the dynamics of an epidemic, including its incidence, prevalence, and ultimately fate [134], [135], [140].",

An immediate consequence of these adaptive changes is that network topology evolves over time in response to the state of the disease. Using the terminology of network science, the specific mechanism in this context is that susceptible agents prune links with their infectious counterparts and with a certain probability rewire with other susceptible or recovered agents. Introducing such a mechanism causes assortative degree mixing as a topological phenomenon and oscillations, hysteresis, and first-order phase transitions as the dynamical phenomena (Fig. 15\n).",

            "text": "An aspect of behavioral epidemiology that has received a lot of attention and more strongly relied on empirical evidence\u2014e.g. the data on the global air transportation network [142]\u2014is individual mobility [143], [144], [145], [146], [147], [148], [149]. Belik et al. [148], for instance, consider bidirectional motion between an origin and a destination in \u201cindividual mobility networks\u201d. These networks capture the fact that most individuals, even if their mobility is high, frequently visit just a limited number of places, as exemplified by commuting from home to work and back. In the model, the authors embed individual mobility networks into larger networks of metapopulations, thus obtaining the results that greatly differ from those of reaction\u2013diffusion (R-D) models. Interesting is that a propagating epidemic front exhibits saturating velocity with an increasing traveling rate, which is in sharp contrast to R-D systems. Merler et al. [146] perform a quantitative analysis of how (i) the spatial structure of the population and (ii) human mobility patterns would influence the spread of a pandemic influenza in Europe. The authors find that the high mobility of the EU population would cause an early importation of the disease from abroad, as well as synchronized local epidemics, further suggesting that the EU should be prepared for a rapid diffusion of an influenza pandemic. Sun et al. [145] resort in their analysis to a more traditional R-D approach in which a cross-diffusion term is introduced to represent the movement of the susceptibles in the direction of lower concentration of the infectives. The results show that the introduced cross-diffusion creates striped, the coexistence of striped and spotted, or just spotted patterns depending on the value of the cross-diffusion coefficient. These patterns are missing when cross-diffusion is zero, indicating that a rudimentary response of the susceptibles to the threat of infection considerably affects the disease dynamics. In addition to individual mobility, some of the most recent works focus on the heterogeneities of contact rates, for which the data from social networks (e.g. Twitter) can arguably be used as a proxy [150], [151], [152], [153]. In the context of future progress, Tizzoni et al. [153] state that an exhaustive framework for simultaneously dealing with the heterogeneities in mobility flows and contact rates is missing. Perhaps an earlier work of Eubank et al. [154] can serve as a basis for new developments in this direction.",

            "text": "Aside from the disease spread itself, human behavior also affects disease prevention\u2014mainly vaccination and several non-pharmaceutical measures [155], [156], [157], [158], [159], [160], [161], [162]. Vaccination is a primary public health measure with the potential to prevent the transmission of infectious diseases, and hence reduce morbidity and mortality from infections [163], [164], [165], [166]. In most instances, vaccination is dependent on voluntary adoption rather than being enforced on the population at risk [165], [167], [168], [169], [170], [171], [172], [173], [174]. Incorporating voluntary adoption into the models of disease dynamics completes a feedback loop as illustrated in Fig. 16\n. Because one feedback in this loop is positive and the other is negative, the overall dynamics may exhibit cycles, which is exactly the case when vaccination-related decision making is represented by, say, game theory or other related constructs [175], [176], [177], [178]. As vaccination coverage increases, herd immunity emerges and effectively prevents the propagation of the disease. Yet, as a consequence of the low disease prevalence, vaccination enthusiasm decreases and the high risk of infection resurfaces. The described phenomenon has been empirically observed and quantitatively verified [175]. Furthermore, if voluntary vaccination is implemented in network populations, a somewhat counterintuitive result [179], [180], [181], [182] is that heterogeneity acts to inhibit the disease outbreak. This result is due to the fact that large-degree nodes have a disproportional effect in attracting neighboring nodes to adopt vaccination [183]. Finally, vaccination can be treated in the context of an opinion formation process, which happens to impede the attainment of full herd immunity [184]. Unvaccinated clusters may emerge and dramatically increases the disease outbreak probability even if the vaccination level is generally high.",

In this context, Valdez et al. [186] consider intermittent social distancing as the primary preventive measure in a network population. Based only on local information, a susceptible agent is able to prune a link with an infectious individual with probability \u03b4 and restore it afterwards such that the underlying interaction topology remains unchanged. With the help of percolation theory, the authors find a cutoff threshold, \u03b4c, directly controlling the eradication of the disease. As for the adoption of non-pharmaceutical measures, an important aspect seems to be the awareness of the current state of an infection and the associated dangers [135], [187]. The spread of awareness strengthens the behavioral response, which in turn affects the trajectory of the infection and the outbreak likelihood [188]. Finally, because non-pharmaceutical measures and vaccines go hand in hand, some recent studies consider the effectiveness of integrated frameworks that combine both of these types of prevention [157], [189]. As a concluding remark, we emphasize that coupled disease-behavior models exhibit dynamics rich with surprising phenomena, yet this richness comes at a price\u2014models are complex and difficult to relate to the available data. Future studies should, therefore, utilize modern technologies to quantify behavioral parameters [190] and analyze the data on real-world human behavior in epidemiological contexts.",

This regime shifting is of considerable interest in other fields, including ecosystem management, population ecology, financial risk assessment, etc. [99], [196], [197], [198]. In ecosystems, for instance, a change in the skewness of control parameters proved to be a potential early warning signal for catastrophic regime shifts [198]. In Mediterranean arid ecosystems, the vegetation patch-size distribution obeys a power law, yet deviations from such a power law occur only at the onset of desertification, thus providing a potentially useful early warning indicator [99]. Despite their usefulness in many situations, non-linear methods may sometimes be an unnecessarily complicated tool, which is why a deep understanding of such methods is needed before they can be put to good use [197].",

A visual confirmation of the described phenomenon using the accompanying spatial patterns is shown in Fig. 17b-d.

The authors investigate the potential impact of a changing mutation rate on spatial pattern transitions and show that the infectious period indefinitely keeps evolving up and down in a cyclic fashion. These cycles in the selection are caused by a change in the spatial patterns from epidemic waves to irregular local outbreaks (Fig. 18\n).",

On the one hand, if the infectious period is relatively short, epidemic waves cause local extinctions of the disease by wiping out the host (susceptible) population. Among co-occurring genotypes at such a location, after a local extinction event, the genotype that is faster in causing the disease outbreak re-invades first and increases its domain of dominance. On the other hand, if the difference in the infectious period between co-occurring genotypes is too big, epidemic waves caused by the fast genotype are broken off by the slow genotype. As a consequence, the host (susceptible) population is prevented from going extinct and outbreaks become irregular. Selection then favors the genotype with a longer infectious period because this genotype is capable of causing more secondary infections.",

Finally, potential interpretations are offered to put pattern transitions into the context of early warning indicators and other complexities arising in spatially explicit settings. We saw that stationary patterns correspond to the stable solutions of model equations, whereas spatio-temporal patterns represent either (i) quasi-periodic or oscillatory waves, (ii) temporal or spatio-temporal chaos, or even (iii) turbulence.",

If a target wave pattern changes to the spiral wave one, the heart rate of patients suffering from cardiac disease notably increases, causing potentially dangerous fibrillation. The evidence of transitions between spatio-temporal patterns in heart disease patients, therefore, make certain aspects of the reviewed results transferable from an epidemiological domain to the study of cardiac disease.",

However, the real-world environments are heterogeneous and heterogeneity affects human motion. In the context of the transmission dynamics, spatial heterogeneity is important because it typically decreases the invasion threshold and induces the outbreak of a disease [205]. Accordingly, with the increasing availability of individual-level high-resolution data, incorporating inhomogeneities into the models of disease spreading is becoming a priority [206]. Generic reaction\u2013diffusion models are mainly concerned with the horizontal and possibly the vertical transmission of diseases [207], corresponding mostly to the expansion and contagious diffusion in the classification of Cromley and McLafferty [208]. Future models, however, need to consider mixed diffusion modes; in addition to the contagious diffusion thorough direct contacts, HIV is an example of a disease that spreads by means of the hierarchical diffusion from large urban areas to smaller communities, as well as the network diffusion driven by social and transportation networks. These alternative diffusion modes are especially needed if the models are to assimilate newly available data such as the data from geographic information systems, nowadays better known as simply GIS.",

The hierarchical diffusion, for example, means that a disease like HIV may spread between large cities sooner than from a large city of origin to its more rural surroundings [208]. The same holds for the network diffusion as well. Such distant dispersals are difficult, if not impossible, to capture using reaction\u2013diffusion and cellular automata models on which we focused herein. For this reason, we did mention some of the most important results in epidemiology obtained from network models, yet there is much potential for further development in this direction [209], [210], [211], [212], [213], [214], [215], [216]. Moreover, dispersal kernel functions [217], [218] offer another way to quantify the distance traveled by either susceptible or infectious individuals. To capture long-distance dispersal in particular, using leptokurtic (i.e. fat-tailed) distributions may be necessary. However, estimating the parameters of these distributions from the data is a challenging task warranting some caution [219], [220].",

As of lately, however, some novel types of transitions can be found in the literature. In the presence of the Allee effect, for example, transitions from stationary patterns to patch invasion are being uncovered [48]. Furthermore, transitions from stationary patterns to wave patterns may be induced by time delays or equal diffusion coefficients for susceptible, infectious, and recovered compartments [46], [221], [222]. Given that pattern transitions may serve as an early warning signal for disease outbreaks, it is of utmost importance to check the universality of these transitions for a wide variety of infections, e.g. seasonal influenza and the slew of emerging infectious diseases. Checking such universality is a formidable task, one that must be based on ample empirical evidence and in-depth interdisciplinary collaborations.",

One example in this context would be applying GIS to store, analyze, and process the spatial information on the propagation of an infectious disease [226], [227]. In this manner, it may be relatively easy to capture both temporal and spatial changes in the disease transmission dynamics. The ultimate goal would be to devise early warning systems based on the dynamical models capable of assimilating GIS (and other) data such that predicting the future course of the disease and recommending the effective control measures finally becomes a reality.",
