A set of rapid and strict countermeasures have taken, including locking down cities, limiting population's mobility and prohibiting almost all avoidable activities. In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the changes in levels of some air pollutants (mainly PM10, NO2 and SO2) in Sal\u00e9 city (North-Western Morocco) during the lockdown measures. In this context, a continuous measurement of PM10, SO2 and NO2 was carried before and during the Covid-19 lockdown period. As a consequence of the security measures and control actions undertaken, the emissions from vehicle exhaust and industrial production were significantly reduced, which contribute to the decrease in the concentrations of the studied pollutants. The obtained results showed that the difference between the concentrations recorded before and during the lockdown period were respectively 75 %, 49 % and 96 % for PM10, SO2 and NO2. PM10 levels were much less reduced than NO2. The three-dimensional air mass backward trajectories, using the HYSPLIT model, demonstrated the benefits of PM10 local emission Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 reductions related to the lockdown were overwhelmed by the contribution of long-range transported aerosols outside areas. In addition, noteworthy differences in the air mass back trajectories and the meteorology between these two periods were evidenced.",

All Moroccan cities were locked down, and the majority of industrial and commercial activities have been forced to stop their activities until further notice. For citizens, the authorities request them to stay at home and don't leave it except for very specific reasons (buy essential supplies, medical appointments\u2026). In add to these safety actions, the authorities decide also to shut down transportation and travel in and out of the country, close down schools, universities, restaurants and mosques, and to ban the mass gatherings across Morocco (Maneesh and El Alaoui, 2020) . However, some activities have been partially maintained as public service operation, pandemic prevention and control, and residential living needs. The Moroccan Government has decided to extend this sanitary state of emergency until 20 May 2020.",

These regulated pollutants arise from anthropogenic sources, including road traffic (e.g., motor exhaust; brake, wear and road erosion; resuspension due to wheelgenerated turbulence) and industrial activities (e.g., metal processing industry and waste management) (Thorpe and Harrison, 2008, He et al., 2020b) .

NO2 showed a significant decrease compared to the first period (before lockdown) when social and industrial activities were operating normally. Its rate reduction was much higher than those observed for PM10 and SO2. This could be explained by the fact that the emergency measures established by the Moroccan authorities, related to the cessation of industrial and transportation activities, had as a consequence a limitation in NO2 emission from both industrial production and vehicle exhaust, which has implicated a sharp decrease in NO2 concentrations during this period.",
