Autopsy revealed that patients 1\u20135 and 7 had coronary artery aneurysms and that patients 8 and 9 had coronary arteritis without aneurysms. Patient 6 had leukemia and developed classic clinical symptoms of acute KD. He developed fatal candidal sepsis 10 days after the onset of KD; autopsy did not reveal evidence of coronary arteritis (table 1). Patients 1, 5, and 7 were included in our previous immunohistochemical study using synthetic KD antibody A [7], as is noted in table 1. Control tissues included formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue from a 3-month-old infant with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection and from a 12-month-old infant with rotavirus infection. We also studied glutaraldehyde-fixed lung tissue from a 1-month-old infant with congenital heart disease and bronchopneumonia and compared the results with those for formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue from the same patient. The present study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Children\u2019s Memorial Hospital",

Large bronchi (completely encased by cartilage) and small, nonciliated bronchi generally did not stain with synthetic antibodies A or J. All tissues that were positive with synthetic antibody A were also positive with synthetic antibody J and had the same pattern of staining, although antibody J generally resulted in stronger staining than did antibody A. Ciliated bronchial epithelium from patient 7 did not stain with synthetic antibody A or J, nor did bronchial epithelium from the control subjects. Nonciliated goblet cells (in the same acute KD bronchi in which positive ciliated cells were present) were also negative, as were control bronchi. Although most IHC-positive bronchi showed no evidence of cellular cytotoxicity [7], some bronchi (from patients 4 and 8) did demonstrate acute bronchitis and even necrotizing bronchitis (figure 2). For patient 4, the preserved epithelial cells in damaged bronchi contained antigen (figure 2)",

Furthermore, in addition to the typical spheroidal bodies, IHC revealed pleomorphic, supranuclear, dark brown\u2013staining material with synthetic antibodies A and J (figures 1 and 2) but not with control synthetic antibody I, suggesting that the antibody was also staining lipofuscin bodies. Therefore, we also performed Fontana staining for lipofuscin. For patients 3, 5, and 6, typical black, supranuclear, granular, lipofuscin staining of the ciliated epithelial cells was observed. However, the level of Fontana staining was much less than the amount of golden yellow granular pigment observed by HE staining and the pleomorphic material stained by IHC. This indicated that the Fontana stain was staining only a relatively small portion of what appeared to be classic lipofuscin in HE sections and suggested that the material that resembled lipofuscin but that was not detected by Fontana stain was KD antigen revealed by IHC.

Inclusion bodies were not present in nonciliated cells. These structures resembled the intracytoplasmic aggregates of viral proteins/nucleic acids, such as nucleocapsid aggregates, that are observed during infection with many RNA viruses (figures 3 and 4) [9\u201313\n]. Because membranes do not survive postmortem degeneration and the paraffin-embedding process, it was not possible to determine whether the inclusion bodies were membrane bound. Furthermore, these harsh conditions would undoubtedly obscure any ultrastructural features of virus-related structures that might be present in the inclusion bodies, for example, nucleocapsids and virions. Nothing resembling intranuclear inclusion bodies or viral components was identified in the nucleus. A section of the IHC-stained block face from patient 1 was compared with the TEM image from that area; excellent correlation was observed between the inclusion bodies identified by IHC and the electron-dense inclusion bodies observed by TEM (figure 3). In patients 1, 3, and 4, in addition to inclusion bodies, many smaller, pleomorphic, electron-dense bodies were also observed. These structures were mostly homogeneous, unlike typical lipofuscin. No structures resembling bacterial, fungal, or parasitic elements were observed by TEM in the inclusion bodies, the epithelial cells, or the ciliated border external to the cells from patients 1\u20134",

            "text": "Although the coronary arteries are the most clinically significant site of inflammation in patients with acute KD, pathological studies indicate a high incidence of inflammatory lesions in many organs and tissues, including the lungs [14]. The epidemiologic profile of KD supports a ubiquitous etiologic agent, and most ubiquitous infectious agents enter the body through either the respiratory or the gastrointestinal tract. The infiltration of IgA plasma cells into the upper respiratory tract in patients with acute KD occurs in a pattern similar to that generally observed during respiratory viral infections [4]. The predominance of CD8 T lymphocytes in the inflammatory cell infiltrate during acute KD [5] implicates an intracellular pathogen as the etiologic agent. Our discovery that synthetic antibodies A and J bind to intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in acute KD ciliated bronchial epithelium leads to speculation that the antibodies bind to antigens derived from the etiologic agent of KD and that the site of primary infection for acute KD may be the medium-sized bronchi of the lungs. Although limited TEM studies have been performed on lymph nodes, kidneys, conjunctivae, and peripheral blood from patients with acute KD [15\u201318\n], the lungs have not been examined. However, if the lungs are the site of primary infection for acute KD, examination of this tissue could be particularly important to understanding the disease\u2019s pathogenesis. Therefore, we studied ciliated bronchial epithelial cells from patients with acute KD by LM and TEM",

            "text": "The detection of golden yellow, lipofuscin-like pigment in ciliated bronchial epithelium from some patients with acute KD was, at first, puzzling. Classic lipofuscin is an age-related pigment\u2014it is especially seen in adult liver, brain, and heart\u2014and consists of oxidatively modified cross-linked proteins originating from autophagocytized, indigestible cytoplasmic components [21]. Although accumulations of lipofuscin can be observed in the neurons of children with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, we were unable to find a precedent for accumulations of lipofuscin-like material in tissues from otherwise healthy infants or even infants with other respiratory infections (such as RSV infection), particularly in bronchial epithelium. The lower quantity of pigment detected by Fontana stain, compared with that observed as golden yellow granular pigment detected by HE stain, and the relatively small pleomorphic brown bodies observed in the IHC preparations suggest that the pigment observed in HE-stained sections is not classic, age-related lipofuscin but rather may be pigment formed during a process of lysosomal degradation of virus. Acute KD ciliated bronchial epithelium appears to contain large quantities of protein in inclusion bodies. The major cytoplasmic pathway used by eukaryotic cells to selectively degrade excess proteins is ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in the proteasome. Proteins not degraded by proteasomes can be autophagocytized, further oxidized within lysosomes, and, therefore, partly converted into lipofuscin. It is possible that excessive viral protein produced in the bronchial epithelial cells cannot be handled by the proteasome and that, as a result, lysosomal activity is increased. Alternatively, several viruses\u2014such as adenovirus [22], herpesviruses [23], and, potentially, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV) [24]\u2014may produce proteins that interfere with proteasome function to their advantage. Proteasome inhibition has been shown to enhance lipofuscin formation [25]. Thus, the etiologic agent of KD may interfere with proteasome function, resulting in increased lysosomal degradation of its proteins and resultant lipofuscin-like deposits containing undigested viral material",

A recent study reported detection of human CoV (HCoV) NL63 in respiratory samples from patients with acute KD by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [26], but we, in collaboration with an international multicenter group of collaborators [27], and at least 2 other independent groups of investigators [28, 29] have subsequently tested respiratory samples from children with acute KD from diverse geographic locations and reported that acute KD is not associated with HCoV-NL63.
