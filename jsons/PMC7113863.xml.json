            "text": "Neutralizing antibodies (NtAbs) elicited after viral infection or vaccination conveyed humoral protection to the population and are essential to viral defense. Thus quantification of NtAbs would be an important criterion in vaccine evaluation as well as the assessment of group protection in human populations before or after vaccination. There are traditional neutralization assay based on inhibition of cytopathic effect (CPE) for viruses that can cause CPE effect on susceptible cell lines in vitro including Enterovirus 71 (EV71) (Chang et al., 2002), Coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) as well as CVB3. However, CPE methods usually take 5\u20137 days of inoculation to let plaques develop and are labor-intensive. Modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays which significantly reduced the duration time still have its shortcomings, such as biosafety concerns raised by live viruses, limited sensitivity, and semi quantitative results due to poor linearity (Huang et al., 2010, Yang et al., 2014). However, pseudovirus based neutralization assays have distinct advantages, as single-round infection ensures superior biosafety and luciferase reporter enables sensitive quantification (Bentley et al., 2015). Pseudovirus based neutralization assays have been widely used to measure neutralizing antibodies for enveloped viruses, such as Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Montefiori, 2005), Influenza virus (Tsai et al., 2009), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-coV) (Li et al., 2003, Sui et al., 2004). Most pseudoviruses of enveloped viruses are utilizing optimized lentivirus or retrovirus pseudotyping system, while there is no common pseudotyping system for nonenveloped viruses.",

Similar strategies had been applied based on our experiences in previously established EV71 single round infection system (Chen et al., 2012). CVB3 sub-genomic replicon plasmid (CVB3 replicon) contains untranslated regions (UTRs), firefly luciferase (luc) reporter gene and all nonstructural protein regions, with a T7 promoter sequence at the upstream of 5\u2032 end used for in vitro transcription. The capsid expressing plasmid, which is designated as EGFP CVB3 (Nancy) Capsid Expresser, contains all the structural genes (VP1-4) and an EGFP reporter gene that are under control of a CMV promoter (Fig. 1\nA). A 2A protease cleavage sequence (AITTL) which was from EV71 genome were introduced both in CVB3 replicon (between luciferase gene and nonstructural genes) and EGFP CVB3 (Nancy) Capsid Expresser (between EGFP gene and capsid). Efficient protease cleavage upon viral polyprotein translation in these two sites was required for viral proteins maturation and pseudovirus encapsidation. The single round pseudovirus was produced by sequential transfection of the capsid expressing plasmid and CVB3 sub-genomic RNA transcribed from CVB3 replicon in vitro (see Section 2). The produced virus is designated as CVB3 (Nancy)-luc. These pseudoviruses can only infect cells once as they lack structural genes and their capsid was provided in producing cell in trans. Successful production of high titer CVB3 pseudovirus showed that inserted 2A sequence from EV71 could be efficiently recognized by CVB3 viral proteases.",

And CVB3 (Nancy)-Luc infection could be neutralized with mouse anti-CBV3 serum in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. S1). We next verified that antiserum from mice immunized with inactivated Nancy viruses could specifically neutralize the infection of CVB3 (Nancy)-luc, while WHO standard antisera against Polio virus, goat anti-G10/CA16 serum, mouse anti-FY523/EV71 serum, mouse anti-Coxsackievirus B5 (CVB5) serum, mouse anti-Hepatitis A virus (HAV) could not neutralize either CVB3 (Nancy)-luc (Fig. 2B) nor CVB3 (Nancy) wild type virus (data not shown) infection in vitro. Taken together, these results proved that the singe-round CVB3 (Nancy)-luc pseudovirus system could be used as a surrogate for wild type virus.

In this work, we also did a small scale serological survey of CVB3 in health adults, and compared CVB3 seroprevalence in pre-school children and adults.

Taken together, we propose that neutralizing antibodies against EV71 and CVB3 can be measured simultaneously. We next would substitute firefly luciferase reporter in CVB3 replicon with renilla luciferase reporter, and use both our previously developed EV71 pseudovirus expressing firefly luciferase and CVB3 pseudovirus expressing renilla luciferase to measure neutralizing antibodies against each virus in the same well (Duel pseudovirus expressing luciferase reporter system). This would further minimize the cost and required clinical serum volume in practice. Many enteroviruses have been found to be associated with HFMD in previous HFMD surveillance; multivalent vaccine may be needed for more effective HFMD control (Liu et al., 2014). Assays with the capacity to evaluate neutralizing antibodies to multiple pathogens simultaneously would be preferred in the future.",

We also analyzed the differences in CVB3 seroprevalence in two representative population groups and found that most pre-school children were naive to CVB3. Although more serum samples from diverse geographic areas and different ages are needed to get a more detailed view of CVB3 seroprevalence, our work provided evidences that CVB3 might impose potential public health threats and further efforts are needed for CVB3 infection control.",
