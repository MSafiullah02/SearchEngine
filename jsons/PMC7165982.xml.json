It is frequently identified alongside rotavirus in outbreaks of diarrhoea. Infection, like all the other pathogens discussed so far, is by the faecal\u2010oral route. Once in the host, the organism goes through a complicated life cycle that involves multiple stages. The cycle starts when the oocyst is exposed to gastric acid and bile salts, resulting in excystation and the release of the first life stage, the sporozoite. The sporozoites invade the intestinal epithelial cells of the ileum, where the infection is typically concentrated. From this location, the sporozoites transform into trophozoites. At this stage, asexual reproduction occurs and Type I meronts are formed. Merozoites are then released into the gut lumen. These organisms can form additional Type I meronts or Type II meronts, which form micro\u2010 and macrogamonts. Micro\u2010 and macrogamonts reproduce sexually to create thin\u2010 and thick\u2010walled oocysts. The thin\u2010walled oocysts lead to autoinfection, whereas the thick\u2010walled oocysts are excreted in the faeces resulting in environmental contamination. Oocysts shed into the environment are infective immediately, and remain viable in the environment for extended periods of time. Oocysts can be found in the faeces of calves as young as three days, although, peak shedding generally occurs at two weeks of age, and can continue to occur in adult cattle. Following infection, clinical signs typically peak at three to five days and last from between 4 to 17 days.",

Control is via excellent colostrum management, impeccable hygiene and calf group management to break cycles of infection, while treatment revolves around the use of oral fluid therapy in the most part. Halofuginone in my opinion may be employed as an adjunct to good husbandry, hygiene and aggressive fluid therapy when disease occurs, but it is neither an effective treatment nor control when used alone without other measures being taken. It is also worth remembering that Cryptosporidium infection very often causes its worst problems when present in combination with one of the viral pathogens, especially rotavirus.

Halofuginone has some effect in reducing diarrhoea in affected calves, but treatment mainly rests on rehydration, provision of electrolytes and nutritional support, and nursing care (heat lamp, dry bed) to enable the calf to recover from the disease. Removal of the affected calf into an isolation unit allows for extra TLC and may reduce the risk of disease spread. Non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatories are probably useful because they reduce gut pain and improve calf demeanour. Once disease occurs in a unit, cryptosporidia are difficult to eliminate because the oocysts are highly resistant. The scouring calf may be shedding vast numbers of oocysts, so the environment is quickly contaminated and spread throughout the group of calves is almost inevitable. Halofuginone can be used prophylactically, but it is more important to improve hygiene to reduce the challenge to calves. All\u2010in, all\u2010out policy with thorough cleaning and disinfection followed by resting of calf buildings until dry will reduce contamination, but is not always practical.

            "text": "Firstly, cryptosporidia are often only part of a diarrhoea problem. Mixed infections, especially with rotavirus, are very common. However, the involvement of cryptosporidia complicates the situation, insofar as immunity against cryptosporidia is not as well transferred via colostrum as against other infectious agents. Also, cryptosporidia are very stable in the environment and very difficult to kill with disinfectants. For these reasons, the most important measures to control cryptosporidiosis concentrate on increasing the general resistance of the calves and reducing the infectious pressure on them. Besides good colostrum intake, the subsequent nutrition plan is vital for the calf's resistance to disease. This is especially an issue in dairy calves. Dairy calves that are still fed according to traditional recommendations, about 10% of their body weight, are only getting enough energy for maintenance, which means they will not have sufficient energy to fight disease. It is generally acknowledged now that this level of nutrition is not favourable for the health and future performance of the calves, and that dairy calves should be fed at least 15% of their birth weight in milk or an equivalent amount of good quality milk replacer. Decreasing the infectious pressure starts with clean calving pens and taking the calf out of the calving area immediately into a clean, well bedded pen or hutch. In problem herds it is a good idea to keep the calves individually housed for the first few weeks, when they are most susceptible. Good hygiene with regard to the feed preparation and the feeding equipment is also paramount. Halofuginone can be used preventatively in problem herds, but it is unlikely to solve the problem if the husbandry conditions are not improved simultaneously.",

Reduce the risk of dystocia, feed good quality colostrum as soon as possible after birth (10% of body weight or 4 litres within the first 4\u20136 hrs as a minimum), continue feeding (or suckling) colostrum for 2\u20133 days. Impeccable hygiene, this may involve snatch calving or individual calving boxes, farm circumstances will dictate the precise practices but the underlying principles are always the same: hygiene and colostrum. The pooling of milk or colostrum is no longer considered best practice; nevertheless feeding all the milk produced by the cow in the first 48\u201372 hrs after calving to her calf over a longer period of time is to be encouraged. The use of waste and antibiotic contaminated milk to feed calves is to be discouraged. Where necessary and appropriate, specific colostral antibodies may be stimulated in the cow by the use of vaccination, colostrum substitutes and supplements may also be used but in my opinion are rarely likely to be beneficial. It is always worth checking the immunoglobulin transfer to calves via some recognised test, for example the Zinc Sulphate Turbidity (ZST) test, gamma\u2010GT, Total Protein or Globulin, on a regular basis. While many of these tests are less than perfect, and may even be an indirect measure of colostrum transfer, they do focus the mind of both the vet and stockman. Many calves are also underfed on milk and may even be deprived of water. It is well worth looking at the feeding regimen for calves as they develop through the first few weeks and months of life and monitoring growth rates of both those with diarrhoea and those that remain healthy. If they are not reaching target growth rates (probably in the region of 0.6\u20130.7 kg/day) then the whole nutritional programme should be reassessed.",

Without this, there is no prospect of reducing the incidence of neonatal disease in calves. A refractometer can be used to estimate serum total protein to screen calves for Failure of Passive transfer (FPT). The average calf (approximately 40 kg) must receive at least 4L good quality colostrum within 6 hours after birth, either by suckling from its dam or by bottle or stomach tube. Colostrum quality can be checked using a colostrometer, and in many herds colostrum quality is inadequate from many cows, related to yield, parity and health of the cow. Colostrum quality begins to fall soon after calving, so that if the calved cow is not milked for several hours, colostrum quality may be inadequate. Colostrum should be cooled immediately to reduce overgrowth of bacteria, and frozen colostrum must be thawed gradually. Only colostrum from Johne's negative cows should be pooled for feeding to other heifer calves. FPT is generally less common in suckler herds because colostrum quality is usually good; problems may occur with overcrowding or mismothering or where heifers fail to bond with their calves.b. Maintain excellent hygiene. The infectious agents that cause neonatal diarrhoea in calves are shed in the faeces of older animals. Contamination begins immediately after birth, so the calving environment must be clean (a dry paddock at low stocking density or a clean straw bed over sand are probably ideal). Calf housing should be thoroughly cleaned between occupants to prevent build\u2010up of infectious organisms. This is often difficult or impossible where calf sheds are in constant use, so temporary accommodation can sometimes be found so that new calves don't have to be added into a shed where diarrhoea is prevalent. Milk feeding utensils must be scrupulously cleaned after each use.c. Feed milk to the calf carefully and keep the routine constant. Milk powder should be stored dry and mixed thoroughly at the correct temperature and concentration. It is more difficult to keep the composition of whole milk constant, though many herds feed whole milk to calves without diarrhoea problems. Milk should be fed at the same time interval every day. The suckler calf is fortunate: it has a constant supply of (more or less) sterile milk at the correct temperature available whenever it is hungry, so unless teats are badly contaminated, milk should not be a source of disease. Suckled calves may occasionally gorge on milk and start a nutritional scour.d.

That means every measure that increases the resistance/immunity of the calf or decreases the infectious pressure will help.

Therefore, normal sized Holstein dairy calves should get 3 litres of the first milking of the dam within two hours of birth (Colostrum 1\u20132\u20133). It is also important that colostrum is harvested immediately after calving, since it rapidly gets diluted otherwise. For dairy calves the proper nutrition following colostrum feed is also of high importance for the resistance of the calf. Traditional feeding systems of 10% of the calf's body weight in milk leaves calves underfed and, therefore, susceptible to disease. Dairy calves should at all times get at least 15% of their birth weight in whole milk, or an equivalent amount of milk replacer.

            "text": "It is important for the farmer to understand that oral rehydration therapy is not a cure for diarrhoea, but is meant to replace the additional losses in fluid and electrolytes that the scouring calf suffers. For this to work, the calf needs to get one or two feeds of an oral rehydration solution additional to the normal milk feedings from the time the scour is first observed up to the point where the faeces are back to normal. It is important that the farmer continues to feed milk to diarrhoeic calves as long as they are drinking, since they are not getting sufficient energy and nutrients out of the rehydration solutions alone. It is also very important to make sure that the oral rehydration solution used has sufficient buffer capacity. Calves tend to get more acidotic, while they have diarrhoea, than humans. However, many of the commercially available solutions are still based on recommendations from human medicine. Oral rehydration solutions suitable for calves should have an alkalinising capacity of 60 to 80 mmol/L from bicarbonate or bicarbonate precursors (the strong ion difference (SID) can be calculated as follows: SID = alkalinising capacity = [Na+]+[K+]\u2010[Cl\u2010]). Oral rehydration solutions can safely be given by stomach tube, however, if the calves are not drinking for more than a day, or if their eyes are sunken they will need to get veterinary attention and most likely intravenous fluid therapy.",
