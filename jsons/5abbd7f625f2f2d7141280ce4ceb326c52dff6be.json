            "text": "To approach the behavior of viruses acting as populations, we must first examine the diversity of the present-day biosphere, and the physical and biological context in which primitive viral forms might have arisen. Evolution pervades nature. Thanks to new theories and to the availability of powerful instruments and experimental procedures, which together constitute the very roots of scientific progress, we are aware that the physical and biological worlds are evolving constantly. Several classes of energy have gradually shaped matter and living entities, basically as the outcome of random events and Darwinian natural selection in its broadest sense. The identification of DNA as the genetic material, and the advent of genomics in the second half of the twentieth century unveiled an astonishing degree of diversity within the living world that derives mainly from combinations of four classes of nucleotides. Biodiversity, a term coined by O. Wilson in 1984, is a feature of all living beings, be multicellular differentiated organisms, single cell organisms, or subcellular genetic elements, among them the viruses. Next generation sequencing methods developed at the beginning of the twenty-first century, which allow thousands of sequences from the same biological sample (a microbial community, a tumor, or a viral population) to be determined, has further documented the presence of myriads of variants in a \"single biological entity\" or in \"communities of biological entities.\" Differences extend to individuals that belong to the same biological group, be it Homo sapiens, Droshophila melanogaster, Escherichia coli, or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). No exceptions have been described. During decades, in the first half of the twentieth century, population genetics had as one of its tenets that genetic variation due to mutation had for the most part been originated in a remote past. It was generally thought that the present-day diversity was essentially brought about by the reassortment of chromosomes during sexual reproduction. This view was weakened by the discovery of extensive genetic polymorphisms, first in Drosophila and humans, through indirect analyses of electrophoretic mobility of enzymes, detected by in situ activity assays to yield zymograms that were displayed as electromorphs. These early studies on allozymes were soon extended to other organisms. Assuming that no protein modifications had occurred specifically in some individuals, the results suggested the presence of several different (allelic) forms of a given gene among individuals of the same species, 1.2 SOME QUESTIONS OF CURRENT VIROLOGY be humans, insects, or bacteria. In the absence of information on DNA nucleotide sequences, the first estimates of heterogeneity from the numbers of electromorphs were collated with the protein sequence information available. An excellent review of these developments (Selander, 1976 ) ended with the following premonitory sentence on the role of molecular biology in unveiling evolutionarily relevant information: \"Considering the magnitude of this effect, we may not be overfanciful to think that future historians will see molecular biology more as the salvation for than, as it first seemed, the nemesis of evolutionary biology.\"",

Viruses are found in surface and deep sea and lake waters, below the Earth surface, in any type of soil, in deserts, and in most environments designated as extreme regarding ionic conditions and temperature (Breitbart et al., 2004; Villarreal, 2005; Lopez-Bueno et al., 2009 ; Box 1.1).

Examples are the response of viruses to selective constraints (be natural or artificial), mechanisms of short-and long-term diversification, or the effect of viral load and genetic bottlenecks in disease progression. These are the types of topics addressed in coming chapters. They have as a common thread that Darwinian natural selection has an immediate imprint on them, observable in the time scale of days or even hours.

Their mutability may be an inheritance of a universal flexibility that probably characterized primitive RNA or RNA-like molecules, thought to have populated an ancestral RNA world at an early stage of life on Earth (Section 1.4.2). Thus, the presence of an RNA at any place in the replicative schemes (Group 1, 2, and 4 in Figure 1 .1) implies error-prone replication and the potential of very rapid evolution. \"Potential\" must be underlined because high error rates do not necessarily result in rapid long-term evolution in nature (Chapter 7). The polynucleotide chain or chains that constitute the viral genome has all the information to generate infectious progeny in a cell, as evidenced by the production of infectious poliovirus from synthetic DNA copies assembled to represent the genomic nucleotide sequence (Cello et al., 2002) .",

Such consequences include alterations of traits as important as host range and pathogenicity, as discussed in following chapters. How such minor changes in viruses can have major biological consequences may relate to the historical role of viruses in an evolving biosphere.

Different notions on the origin of life have been held in human history, often linked to religious debate. Opinions have ranged from a conviction of the spontaneous and easy generation of life from inanimate materials, or its beginning from a unique and rare combination of small prebiotic molecules, or its being the result of a lengthy prebiotic process, or its inevitability as the outcome of the evolution of matter in our universe (or \"sets\" of universes with the adequate physical parameters, according to some cosmological models).

This was somewhat paradoxical because chemists of the seventeenth century divided chemistry into mineral chemistry, vegetal chemistry, and animal chemistry. J.J. Berzelious put together animal and plant chemistry and named the resulting discipline \"organic\" chemistry, which he distinguished from \"inorganic\" chemistry (Berzelious, 1806) . He formulated what was known as the \"central dogma of chemistry\": \"The generation of organic compounds from inorganic compounds, outside a living organism, is impossible.\" The classical experiments of L. Pasteur provided a definitive proof that, at least under the prevailing conditions on present-day Earth, \"life comes from life\" (Pasteur, 1861) . He established what was considered the \"central dogma of biology\": \"The generation of a whole living organism from chemical compounds, outside a living organism is impossible.\" The requirement of life to generate life was, however, extended to the belief that \"living\" and \"nonliving\" were two totally separate categories in the organization of matter, and that organic compounds, and obviously proteins, could be synthesized only by living cells. This doctrine, called \"vitalism\" dominated biology for almost a century and in a modified manner it continues today regarding the interpretation of mental activity in humans (matter and spirit as \"substance dualism\"), and the attitude toward some recent developments in genetic engineering and biotechnology (for a general discussion see Silver, 2007) . Aspects of the early views on the origin of life have been addressed in several publications (Rohlfing and Oparin, 1972; Bengtson, 1994; de Duve, 2002; Eigen, 2002 Eigen, , 2013 Lazcano, 2010, among others) .",

He mimicked the conditions thought to be prevalent in the primitive Earth, and mixed hydrogen (H 2 ), ammonium (NH 3 ), and methane (CH 4 ) in a sealed reactor with an influx of water vapor. Synthesis of a number of organic compounds occurred under the influence of electrical discharges. The de novo synthesized chemicals included amino acids (glycine, alanine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid) formic, acetic, propionic and fatty acids, cyanide, and formaldehyde (Miller, 1953 (Miller, , 1987 . Several researchers followed the Miller's approach using other starting chemical mixes, and confirmed that key components of the macromolecules that are associated with living materials (notably purines, pyrimidines, and amino acids) can be made from precursors which were abundant in the primitive Earth or its atmosphere. Today, variant versions of Miller's protocol (including additional starting chemicals, aerosol spread of chemicals, freezethaw cycles, different sources of energy, electron beams, etc.) produce interesting information on the synthesis of organic molecules (Dobson et al., 2000; Miyakawa et al., 2002; Bada and Lazcano, 2003; Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2014) . Intense ultraviolet (UV) irradiation may have contributed to the synthesis of compounds relevant to life: ammonia, methane, ethane, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, sugars, nitric acid, and cyanide. Complex organic compounds (notably aromatic hydrocarbons and alcohols) are also found in interplanetary dust, comets, asteroids, and meteorites, and they can be generated under the effect of cosmic and stellar radiation. Thus, many organic compounds could have been produced within the Earth atmosphere or away from it, and be transported to the Earth surface by meteorites, comets, or rain, to become the building blocks for additional life-prone organic molecules. Places at which peptide bond formation and prebiotic evolution could have been favored are hydrothermal systems and the interface between the ocean and the atmosphere (Chang, 1994; Horneck and Baumstark-Khan, 2002; Ehrenfreund et al., 2011; Parker et al., 2011; Danger et al., 2012; Griffith and Vaida, 2012; Ritson and Sutherland, 2012) .",

These materials suggest that the surface temperature of the Earth was below 100 \u00b0C, with the presence of liquid and vapor water, and gases supplied by intense volcanism (CO 2 , SO 2 , and N 2 ). The composition of primitive rocks, together with theoretical considerations, suggest a neutral redox composition of the Earth atmosphere (relative abundances: N 2 , CO 2 > CO \u226b CH 4 , H 2 O \u226b H 2 , SO 2 > H 2 S) around the time of the origin of primeval forms of life. The possible presence of a reducing atmosphere (N 2 , CO > CH 4 > CO 2 , H 2 O, ~H 2 , H 2 S > SO 2 ) generally or locally is still debated, but increasingly viewed as unlikely. In an oxidative atmosphere yields of amino acids, nucleotides, and sugars would be lower. Either these diminished yields were sufficient or an earlier reduced atmosphere may have accumulated relevant building blocks, among other possible scenarios (Trail et al., 2011) . Despite the validity of \"life comes from life\" in the current Earth environment, the experimental facts suggest that there is no barrier for the generation of life from nonlife, provided suitable environmental conditions are met. In this line, A.I. Oparin proposed that a \"primitive soup\" could well have been the cradle of life on Earth, as described in his famous treatise on the origin of life (Oparin, 1938; English version 1953) , a concept that had already been sketched by C. Darwin. \"Protein first\" and \"nucleic acid first\" as temporal priority for the origin of life is still a contended issue, although in recent decades the preference for nucleic acids due to their superior capacity for selforganization to perpetuate inheritable messages through base pairings has been favored. Paradoxically, however, the building blocks of nucleic acids have been more difficult to obtain from primeval chemicals than the building blocks of proteins. Peptides of about 20 amino acids in length could have been easily formed under prebiotic conditions (Fox, 1988; Fox and Dose, 1992) , and the peptides or derived multimers had a potential to display catalytic activities in a protometabolic stage. Short nucleotide and amino acid polymers might have contributed to cross a complexity threshold for self-sustained replication to arise and evolve (Kauffman, 1993) . As soon as peptide-or protein-based catalytic activities developed, they had to be coordinated with oligo-or poly-nucleotide replication. This integration of genotypic information with its phenotypic expression may be achieved through hypercyclic couplings, as proposed by M. Eigen and P. Schuster (1979; Eigen, 2013) . A synchronous and sharp increase of bacteriophage Q\u03b2 RNA and proteins during E. coli infection was taken as an experimental proof of the presence of a hypercycle. However, there are multiple molecular mechanisms involved in achieving a necessary increase in viral RNA and proteins during cytolytic infections. The experimental evidence of a general principle of hypercyclic organization should not be taken to mean that Q\u03b2 is a remnant of a primitive coupling between replication and translation.",

            "text": "Substantiating the abiotic synthesis of nucleotide-or amino acid-based polymers has been arduous relative to the synthesis of monomeric organic molecules. However, work by L. Orgel and his colleagues documented that polynucleotides could be synthesized from activated nucleotides in the absence of any 1.4 ORIGIN OF LIFE: A BRIEF HISTORICAL ACCOUNT AND CURRENT VIEWS enzyme (as a review of these early developments, see Miller and Orgel, 1974) . Recent work has established that there are multiple chemical pathways for abiotic nucleotide synthesis (reviewed in Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2014) . Mineral surfaces (clay minerals, zeolites, manganates, hydroxides, etc.) have been proposed as key participants in the origin of life, by providing scaffolds for the synthesis of nucleotide and amino acid polymers (Bernal, 1951; Gedulin and Arrhenius, 1994; Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2014) . The relevant features of clays are their adsorption power, ordered structure, capacity to concentrate organic compounds, and their ability to serve as polymerization templates. Adsorption onto mineral surfaces may lower the activation energy of intermolecular reactions. Minerals with excess positive charge on their surfaces might have played a role in the evolution of RNA-like or RNA-precursor molecules. It has been suggested that mineral-organic complexes (chimeras between materials once thought to belong to unmixable categories) could have been the first living organisms endowed with a genetic program (Cairns-Smith, 1965) . Bond formation and chain extension, which are needed to synthesize nucleic acids and proteins prebiotically, are inhibited in liquid water, thus favoring mineral surfaces as potential biogenic sites. Polymer formation could have been facilitated also by heating and drying, with a key involvement of the dried phases in catalysis (reviews in Towe, 1994; Horneck and Baumstark-Khan, 2002) . On different clay types, nucleotides and amino acid polymers of dozens of residues have been synthesized, providing a realistic scenario for a transition toward primitive self-replicating entities (Ferris et al., 1996) . One of the first types of Darwinian positive selection could operate prebiologically through differential surface binding. We arrive at the paradox that while primitive polymerization reactions might have required dry surfaces, later forms of life evolved in a water-rich environment, being water the major component of cells. \"Origin\" and \"establishment and evolution\" of life have been considered either as linked processes that obey similar rules, or distinct events whose investigation requires dissimilar approaches. A distinction between \"origin\" and \"establishment\" will become pertinent also when addressing the origin versus the evolution of viruses later in this chapter and the mechanisms of viral disease emergence in Chapter 7.",

The prebiotic synthesis of potential building blocks-which might have been initiated earlier than 5000 million years ago-renders plausible the existence of a pre-RNA era that was then replaced by an RNA world in the late Hadean early Archean periods on Earth. This stage should have been followed by one in which RNA was complemented by DNA as repository of genetic information (Bywater, 2012) . Polymers other than DNA and RNA are also capable of encoding evolvable inheritable information (Pinheiro et al., 2012; Robertson and Joyce, 2012) . Heterogeneous nucleic acid molecules (including mixtures of ribo-and desoxyribo-polymers) can give rise to functional nucleic acids (Gilbert, 1986; Lazcano, 1994a; Gesteland et al., 2006; Derr et al., 2011; Szostak, 2011; Trevino et al., 2011) . RNA enzymes (ribozymes) such as RNA ligases can evolve from random-sequence RNAs (Joyce, 2004; Sczepanski and Joyce, 2014) . The critical polymerization reaction involves the formation of a phosphodiester bond and release of pyrophosphate-analogous to the reactions catalyzed by the present-day RdRps-and represent an incipient, primitive anabolism (Eigen, 1992; Lazcano, 1994a; Orgel, 2002 Orgel, , 2004 Dworkin et al., 2003; Joshi et al., 2011) . In support of a possible link between catalytic RNA activities and solid mineral surfaces in the origin of life (as summarized in Section 1.4.1), the catalytic activity of the hammerhead ribozyme of the Avocado Sun Blotch viroid was maintained when bound to the clay mineral montmorillonite (Biondi et al., 2007) .",

Present-day biological systems use only d-ribose (d from \"dextro\" or rotation of the plane of polarized light to the right) while chemical condensation reactions produce equal amounts of the d-and l-(levo) forms. Nonenzymatic template-dependent reactions can be inhibited by the incorrect enantiomer. This led to the proposal that analogs devoid of enantiomeric forms, such as glycerol derivatives, could have been the basis of the most primitive genetic systems (Schwartz and Orgel, 1985) . Theoretical studies support the notion that initial achiral conditions can evolve toward chilarity, in what has been defined as an extension of punctuated equilibrium to prebiological evolution (Gleiser et al., 2008) .",

            "text": "so profound have been the changes experienced by the Earth and its surroundings over 4 billion years. Contemporary catalytic RNAs (found in the ribosome, as part of some protein complexes, and in some viroids), as well as nucleotide-like coenzymes have been considered as possible molecular remnants of a primitive RNA world (Lazcano, 1994a) . Some authors consider the possibility that cells whose genetic material is made of RNA may still hide in some remote sites of our planet (Yarus, 2010) . For a transition from a purely RNA (or RNA like) world to an extended scenario with participation of proteins, the presence of a transfer RNA (tRNA) quasispecies and the generation of a genetic code endowed with evolutionary potential must have been critical (Eigen, 1992) . Initial theories of how the genetic code might have arisen were put forward by F. Crick, L. Orgel, and C. Woese in the middle of the twentieth century. Main proposals included a stereochemical fit between some amino acids and the corresponding bases (or codons to be), progressive evolution from a one nucleotide to a three nucleotides code, gradual incorporation of amino acids in the coding system, and the frozen accident model of codon universality (for a review of early concepts, see Crick, 1968) . New insights on the code origin have come from integrating knowledge of the mechanisms of protein synthesis with likely events in the RNA world. Primitive tRNA quasispecies (around 4000 million years ago, late Hadean, early Archean, Figure 1 .3) and tRNA aminoacylating ribozymes evolved to fit the genetic code which was later expanded in coevolution with the translation machinery (Szathmary, 1999; Rodin et al., 2011; Caetano-Anolles et al., 2013) . Recent models retain several features of the early proposals. The age of the genetic code has been estimated in 3.8 \u00b1 0.5 thousand million years (Eigen, 2013) . The present structure of the genetic code is remarkably redundant, and it minimizes the deleterious effects of mutations, suggesting that protein conservation offers a general selective advantage for most cellular entities. Code redundancy may also contribute to functional mRNA secondary structures and stability (Shabalina et al., 2006 ; see also Chapter 2).",

            "text": "The most salient attributes of living matter are reproduction, evolvability, energy conversion, and compartmentalization. Two of them are found in viruses: reproduction and evolvability. What selective forces might have led to the integration of these features? Concerning reproduction, there must have been a critical transition from the absence of any inheritable instruction (despite the presence of primitive polymers) to the first molecules endowed with \"inheritable\" information, for example, a macromolecule capable of producing copies of itself. The transition from \"noninformation\" to \"information\" is an essential question for the origin of life that implicates both theory of evolution and information. Current evidence suggests that the process that allowed such critical transformation was slow and inaccurate. Slow because the catalytic RNAs selected in the laboratory are about 10 million-fold slower than most protein enzymes (Jeffares et al., 1998; Yarus, 2010) . Inaccurate because pre-enzymatic nucleotide polymerization would rarely display error rates below 10 \u22121 to 10 \u22122 mutations per nucleotide copied (Inoue and Orgel, 1983) . Despite a likely hostile environment, no \"predators\" (be molecular such as degrading enzymes or others) were present to impede a slow accumulation of variant replicating molecules. Random and unavoidable mistakes allowed polymers to wander in sequence space with reproductive impunity until areas that promoted increased self-organization, replication, and adaptation were encountered. The adaptive potential of mutant distributions is a key concept in the quasispecies theory of the origin of life (Eigen and Schuster, 1979) , and a signature of present-day viruses (Chapter 3). Replicative innacuracy and heterogeneity appear as recurrent requirements for the major transitions and adaptedness of the forms generated throughout prebiological and biological evolution. Once a primitive molecular \"memory\" (signature sequences with some replication ability) was implemented, in the words of M. Eigen: \"....information generates itself in feedback loops via replication and selection, the objective being 'to be or not to be'\" (Eigen, 1994 (Eigen, , 2013 . In those times this was the only and simple requirement: to be or not to be. This singular transition resulted in the first replicating entities that are also termed \"replicators\" or \"replicons.\" They were selected for replicability, stability, and evolvability with trade-offs (acquisition of benefits for one of the three traits at some cost for another trait) likely playing a role at this stage (see Chapter 4 for trade-offs in virus evolution). Assuming a stage in the absence of peptides, optimization of primitive replicons should have been facilitated by the fact that the same molecule embodied both genotype and phenotype (Eigen, 2013) , again a feature of present-day RNA viruses. The genomic RNA by itself determines phenotypic traits, independently of its protein-coding activity. \"Priming\" of polynucleotide synthesis in the sense we know it today should not have been a limitation since circular RNA or RNA-like molecules could fold partially to prime their own copying. The term \"replicon\" currently refers to any simple genetic element that encodes sufficient information to be copied (i.e., viruses, plasmids, etc.), even if the copying is carried out by (or in conjunction with) elaborate cell-dependent machineries. Virtual replicons are used in computer simulations, to learn about the dynamics of natural living systems (as reviews, see Adami, 1998; Eigen, 2013) .",

The sun was about 25-30% less luminous than it is today yet it produced more UV light. Due to the absence of oxygen and of an ozone layer, the UV radiation that reached the Earth was 10-to 100-fold more intense than today, the difference being accentuated for the radiation in the 200-280 nm range. Studies of the conversion of UV radiation into DNA-damage equivalents suggest a 2-3 logarithm larger biologically relevant UV radiation during the time of the putative RNA world as compared with today's radiation (Canuto et al., 1982; Chang, 1994; Horneck and Baumstark-Khan, 2002) . In such an environment, radiation-related mutational input could have had drastic effects on replicating entities in ways that can be only roughly anticipated from the present-day chemistry. Even the simplest present-day RNA genetic systems, with their small target size, would undergo severe radiation damage. Reconstruction of protein enzyme-free nucleic acid synthesis under the radiation conditions prevalent on Earth during the RNA world development, during late Hadean and early Archean eras offers a fascinating challenge and opportunity of experimental research for the raising field of Astrobiology.",

The fact that we have first discussed the origins of inheritable information should not be taken as its being independent from the incorporation of molecules capable of supplying energy for key reactions. The primitive cellular-like organizations might have obtained energy either from organic molecules captured from the external environment ( heterotrophy) or from metabolites they synthesized endogenously using external energy (autotrophy). One line of thought considers that it is more likely that the first cells were heterotrophs, and that only later they evolved toward autotrophy, in the form of photosynthesis, which represented a major transition in the repertoire of biosynthetic pathways. According to this model, fermentation reactions were likely the first ones exploited to break energy-rich bonds, as a source of energy for primordial biochemical reactions.",

One of these proposals is that formation of pyrite from hydrogen sulfide was used by primitive cells as an energy source, resulting from reactions such as FeS + H 2 S \u2192 FeS 2 + 2H + +2e \u2212 (W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user, 1994) . Positive charges on pyrite crystals could accumulate negatively charged molecules (e.g., the products of CO 2 fixation) and undergo reductive reactions. The system might have selected surface-bound polymers rather than monomers, and given rise to biochilarity (selection of one enantiomeric form over another) because of the chiral structure of pyrite (W\u00e4chtersh\u00e4user, 1988) . Then, an evolution toward an Archean carbonfixation cycle would occur, a precursor of the metabolic cycles found in present-day archeal and bacterial organisms (Ruiz-Mirazo et al., 2014) . The picture may have been more complex, as judged by the success of mixotrophic organisms which are capable of switching from phototrophy (light-mediated break down of CO 2 for their metabolism) to heterotrophy in some extreme environments of the presentday Earth (Laybourn-Parry and Pearce, 2007).",

Here a second decisive positive selection event might have entered the scene at the stage of formation of protocells and the first individual cells (3600-3200 million years ago, Figure 1 .3; Eigen, 1992) . Lipid bilayers endowed with a splitting capacity should have been strongly selected at this stage of life development because of their power to spread. This underlines the concept that Darwinian selection need not be associated exclusively with template-copying processes (Chapter 10). Membrane traffic and reorganizations are essential for the life cycle of many present-day viruses (Huotari and Helenius, 2011). Virus particle stability and capacity to spread, associated with membrane capture and interactions, might derive from the early genomes that exploited membranebased organelles to achieve functional diversification.

Influenced by the discovery of bacteriophages by F. d'Herelle, J.B.S. Haldane proposed viruses as intermediates between the prebiotic soup and primitive cells (reviewed in Lazcano, 2010) . In those times knowledge of viruses was still superficial from todays' perspective, and lent to daring proposals coherent with viruses being perceived as simple. Despite simplicity and replication being features that could be also attributed to primitive life forms, we have to distinguish the role that virus-like entities might have played in the establishment of early life from the possibility that present-day viruses reflect how early life might have been. A reader versed in the structural and functional complexity of RNA viruses, with all the intricacies of virus-host relationships, will realize how unlikely is that present-day RNA viruses are remnants of an ancestral RNA world, at least as current evidence portrays it. Also, the conditions prevailing in the RNA world did not necessitate that a primitive replicon displays rapid replication-a trait of most present-day viruses-for it to become established, because of the scarcity of predators.",

HDV is dependent on HBV for the completion of its infectious cycle (reviewed in Quer et al., 2008; Taylor and Pelchat, 2010) . The HDV genome is a mosaic RNA consisting of a viroidlike RNA and an RNA region whose complementary RNA (antigenomic strand) encodes two forms of a structural protein termed the delta antigen. Both the genomic and antigenomic RNAs possess a strong secondary structure with about 70% paired nucleotides. The delta antigen is encapsidated by the HBV surface antigen as a component of HDV particles. Thus, HDV appears to be the result of an RNA conjunction between a viroid-like RNA and an mRNA-coding region. Such conjoined RNAs might have been the precursors of the modern eukaryotic organization into coding sequences (exons) and intervening sequences (introns) (Sharp, 1985; Robertson, 1992 Robertson, , 1996 Chao, 2007; Taylor and Pelchat, 2010) .",

At a later stage, the positively transmitted cell could have regressed toward a subcellular transmissible form. Prokaryotic cells can spread effectively among differentiated eukaryotic hosts, and tumor cells have been regarded as transmissible parasites (Banfield et al., 1965; Murgia et al., 2006; Pearse and Swift, 2006) . The observation that some \"infectious cells\" can be disseminated by insects provides a model for an early origin of vector-borne viruses. For a number of viruses, notably HIV-1, it has been recognized that transmission of virus from an infected cell into a recipient cell need not involve a prolonged stay of the virus in the extracellular environment. Infection \"synapses\" allow intimate cellto-cell contacts through which virus transmission takes place. It is estimated that synapse-mediated transmission may be 100-fold more efficient than transmission of viral particles released into the extracellular environment. Obviously, acquisition of a capacity for long-range transmission in space and time should have provided a selective advantage to a virus. Perhaps the participation of infection synapses in virus transmission is an evolutionary remnant of an early period in which the infectious entities were cells, with now the \"cell-to-environment-to-cell\" mode of transmission coexisting with the \"cell-to-cell\" mode.",

From the catalogs of regulatory sequences and proteincoding genes from cellular organisms and viruses whose functions have been identified, some viral genes, notably those encoding the viral capsid and the genome packaging machinery, appear to be devoid of a cellular counterpart. Such typical viral genes constitute what has been referred to as the \"conserved innate viral self\" (Krupovic and Bamford, 2007) , that embraces essential functions for the phenotypic traits shared by all viruses. Other viral functions do not deviate in any salient way from cellular functions. They include viral proteins involved in genome replication, and in proteolytic processing of proteins and polyprotein precursors. Comparative genomics suggests that the exchange of functional and structural modules through lateral gene transfers, together with fine adjustments mediated by mutation, have contributed to the coadaptation of cells and autonomous replicons over ancient evolutionary periods (Gorbalenya, 1995; Holland and Domingo, 1998; Jalasvuori and Bamford, 2008; Villarreal, 2008) . Even mechanisms that prompt viral variation in cell tropism (Chapter 4) have parallels in differentiated organism. As an example, a two amino acids insertion into ectodysplasin-a member of the tumor necrosis-binding family-alters its receptor specificity, and the differential expression of the two protein versions plays a role in epidermal morphogenesis (Yan et al., 2000) . Furthermore, as the number of three-dimensional structures for viral a cellular enzymes has increased to reach thousands, structural similarities between key cellular and viral enzymes (polymerases, proteases) have become apparent. Arguments in favor of either ancestral cells or ancestral viruses being the main source of what we now identify as functional modules may never be settled. Baltimore (1980) proposed that a limited number of \"archetypal\" proteins could be responsible for RNA virus function. He named as \"archetypal\" a \"positive virus polymerase,\" a \"negative virus polymerase,\" a set of \"surface\" proteins, and several \"proteases,\" among other proteins and regulatory elements. The argument that \"archetypal\" modules could spread among positive and negative strand RNA viruses was based on features and mechanisms now recognized as much more profuse than in 1980: the multifunctionality of viral proteins, their capacity to diversify by mutation, and the existence of RNA recombination (Chapter 2). Regulatory strategies were also likely shared by cells and viruses. Small micro-RNAs that now populate the cellular world can act as molecular switches for RNA viral genomes to modulate their replication and gene expression (van Rij and Andino, 2008; Diaz-Toledano et al., 2009) . A long coevolution of protocells and primitive virus-like elements that gradually yielded the continuously coevolving cells (at the individual and organismal level) and viruses we see today is a likely course of events.",

Their transfer to lower temperatures might have modulated their permeability prior to the stage at which peptide or protein transporters were inserted as membrane components. Here again, \"heterogeneities\" became important: membranes made of mixtures of amphiphiles display increased thermostability, permeability, and tolerance to divalent cations. Budding vesicles endowed with traits such as growth, division, and permeability should have been positively selected for their ability to spread favorable replicating molecules and protocellular functions. Selected protoviral vesicles became gradually dispensable for the spreading of beneficial genes, and viruses evolved from being solely beneficial entities into displaying also a parasitic behavior that exploited cell resources (compare with Sections 1.7 and 1.8). According to this model, when cells became independent units surrounded by a lipid membrane, viruses promoted selection of cells that expressed peptidoglycan molecules on their surface to decrease or prevent virus infection. This transition could mark the onset of an arms race behavior that has been associated with a survival strategy of many present-day viruses. One of the early outcomes might have been the formation of a cell wall, that allowed vertical transmission of genetic information, and rendered the cell metabolically independent. In addition, it provided an osmotic environment suitable for energy production. Genetic information and molecular devices for energy capture, storage, and use were equally important for a sustainable cellular organization. Thus, according to this theory, viruses originated from protoviral elements whose main function was to spread useful genes horizontally. The evolved viruses acted as selective agents to promote microbial evolution and then became established in an increasingly differentiated cellular world (Villarreal, 2005 (Villarreal, , 2008 Hendrix, 2008; Jalasvuori and Bamford, 2008) .",

The abundance of endogenous retroviruses in the mammalian genomes is a clear symptom of such a genetic flow. A nonfunctional viral infectivity factor (Vif) (the HIV-1 protein that can counteract the mutagenic activity of the apolipoprotein B mRNA editing complex (APOBEC) proteins; see Section 2.7 in Chapter 2) was found in the remnant of a rabbit endogenous retrovirus termed rabbit endogenous lentivirus type k (Katzourakis et al., 2007) .

            "text": "Present-day viruses reveal several mechanisms of exchange of genetic material that might have roots in early cellular evolution. Temperate bacteriophages (the prototypic example being E. coli phage \u03bb) integrate their genomic DNA in the DNA of their host bacteria. The uptake of cellular genes by viruses has been amply documented in transducing bacteriophages (those that can transfer DNA from one bacterium to another), as well as in RNA and DNA tumor viruses. Even RNA viruses that are not known to include a reverse transcription step in their replication cycle can incorporate host RNA sequences. Replication-competent, cytopathic variants of bovine viral diarrhea virus (a type species of the genus Pestivirus of the important family of pathogens Flaviviridae) can acquire cellular mRNA sequences in their genome, via nonhomologous recombination (Meyers et al., 1989) . Insertion of 28S ribosomal RNA sequences into the hemagglutinin gene of influenza virus increased its pathogenicity (Khatchikian et al., 1989) . Some defective-interfering particles of Sindbis virus included cellular tRNA sequences at their 5\u2032-ends (Monroe and Schlesinger, 1983) . Sequences related to some flaviviruses can persist in an integrated form into the DNA of the insect vectors Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti (Crochu et al., 2004) . Endogenous hepatitis B viruses (eHBVs) have been identified in the genomes of birds and land vertebrates (amniotes), crocodilians, snakes, and turtles. The evidence is that eHBVs are more than 207 million years old, and that ancient HBV-like viruses infected animals during the Mesozoic Era (Suh et al., 2014; Figure 1.4) . The existence of alternative mechanisms for the integration of viral genetic material into cellular DNA suggests an ancient origin and a selective advantage of exchanges of genetic information in shaping a diverse and adaptable cellular world (Eigen, 1992 (Eigen, , 2013 Gibbs et al., 1995; Villarreal, 2005 Villarreal, , 2008 . 1.8 VIRUS AND DISEASE",

The presence of a dsRNA mycovirus in a fungus is essential for the latter to confer heat tolerance to some plants; these findings have defined a three-way symbiosis required for an important phenotypic trait (Marquez et al., 2007; Roossinck, 2013) .

An arms race implied by the virushost interactions described in previous sections might have been the modus vivendi for viruses, only interrupted by occasional armistices. Alternatively, symbiotic and mutualistic interactions might have been the norm, only interrupted by occasional defections by killer personalities that have become the key actors of hospital wards and virology textbooks (Roossinck, 2011) . It is fashionable to favor the second model, but one can find arguments in favor of either scenario. As discussed in connection with natural counterparts of the transition toward error catastrophe in viruses (Chapter 9), cells have evolved to be able to divert some physiological activities to become part of an innate immune response against viruses. This phenotypic flexibility of cellular functions to the point of being used to confront viruses attests of transient losses of an equilibrated coexistence. Some middle-and long-term equilibrium between virus and host population numbers must be continuously restored by selective events, otherwise this book would not have been written.",

Superinfection exclusion is one of the mechanisms used by present-day cells to limit replication of a virus when another one is actively replicating (or incorporated) into the same cell. Exclusion has a biochemical interpretation in the competition of two viral entities for cellular resources, but it might have been boosted by early cellular adaptation to limit viral invasions (Chapter 4). Likewise, components of the intrinsic and innate immune response that prevent infection and disease might have been also endowed with activities that promoted cell variation for adaptability. Cellular editing activities such as those displayed by some of the adenosine deaminase acting on double stranded RNA and APOBEC proteins are also part of the innate immune response against some viruses. Not surprisingly, in turn, viruses have evolved multiple functions to counteract the host immune response (Chapter 4).",

Opportunistic invasions should lead mainly to disease-prone viruses, while long coevolutionary periods should lead to a dominance of nonpathogenic viruses. Not all viruses that have been characterized are pathogenic and, in fact, only a minority of those that exist might be. However, since only a few of the viral genomes that metagenomic surveys have detected have been characterized, it is not possible to adventure a proportion of beneficial or neutral versus harmful viruses. In the course of investigations on poliomyelitis, a search for related viruses was undertaken, and a number of new viruses later to be known as echoviruses were discovered. They were isolated because they caused cytopathology to cells in culture. The virus-containing samples were from individuals that did not show symptoms of a viral infection. The new isolates were designated as \"orphans,\" meaning viruses without disease. The term echovirus derives from enteric cytopathogenic human orphan virus. Some of them, or their close relatives, were later associated with disease syndromes, but others not. Viruses as diverse as circoviruses, polyoma, or herpesviruses colonize a considerable proportion of animals, and only some of the virus types are the direct cause of disease (e.g., postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) by porcine circovirus type 2, or cancer by some polyomaviruses, among many other examples). Disease potential is unrelated to viral genome size. PMWS is associated with the smallest mammalian DNA virus genome of only 1.7 Kb, while the almost 100-fold larger herpes virus genomes can coexist with immunocompetent humans without noticeable disease. The fact that a virus is pathogenic or not depends on intricacies of virus-host interactions that are poorly understood.",

Viruses may not damage essential cell functions, but may affect dispensable cellular functions. Studies by M.B.A. Oldstone and his colleagues on persistent infections of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in neuroblastoma cells demonstrated that the resident virus altered a differentiated cell trait while preserving vital functions (Oldstone et al., 1977) . This is one of many examples of virus-induced modifications of the so-called \"luxury\" functions of cells (Oldstone, 1984) . Later work unveiled the changes in gene expression that underlie some of these alterations. Again, there is no clear cut distinction between a virus being or not pathogenic. Disease manifestations depend on multiple host and viral factors, including coinfections with viruses or other agents. With the increase of infections by HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) experienced during the end of the twentieth century, dual infections with these two viruses are now frequent. The evolution of HCV-associated liver disease (i.e., an increasing degree of liver fibrosis) is accelerated in individuals coinfected with HIV-1. Given the number of viruses still to be discovered (Section 1.3), and the spectrum of mild to severe pathologies that can be associated with \"different\" variants of the \"same\" virus (Holland et al., 1992) , we cannot anticipate whether most or only a minority (as often assumed) of the viruses that currently replicate in our biosphere are pathogenic or potentially so (Li and Delwart, 2011 ).",
