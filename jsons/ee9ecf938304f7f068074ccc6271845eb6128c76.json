[2] Seven of the 34 operative patients (20\u00a26%) died of COVID-19 associated complications. This mortality rate is much higher than the reported overall case-fatality rate of 2\u00a23% in COVID-19 patients without surgery, [9] and also higher than the case-fatality rate of 7\u00a29% in noncardiac surgical patients without COVID-19 infection who were admitted to multidisciplinary ICU. [20] Furthermore, the average duration from the time of first symptom to death of the 7 non-survivors (8\u00a27 days, range 4 to 13 days) is apparently shorter than that reported previously. In the report of Huang and colleagues, [5] the median time from onset of symptoms to first hospital admission was 7.0 days (4.0\u00c08.0) and to ICU admission was 10.5 days (8.0\u00c017.0) and 6 patients (15% of the total of 41 cases studied) did not survive ICU. The study did not report the exact dates of patient death, but it is safe for us to say that the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was longer than 10.5 days and thus longer than that of the non-survivors in our study. In other words, it is highly likely that surgical stress occurred during the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 infection exacerbated disease progression and severity. Currently, no specialized medication is available for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and supportive measures remain the mainstay of COVID-19 treatment. Thus, the patient's immune function is a major determinant of the disease severity, and populations with low immune function, such as older people are more vulnerable and have high mortality after COVID-19 infection. [7] Surgery may not only cause immediate impairment immune function, [12] but also induce early systemic inflammatory response. [21] Similar to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, [22] the SARS-CoV infected lung could induce and increase the amount of macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, and increase the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. [23, 24] And, the high levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines has been reported to be correlated with the severity of illness in patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). [5] Consistent with these findings, the most common laboratory abnormalities in this study were lymphopenia (29 [85\u00a23%] of 34 patients) and increased hypersensitive C-reactive protein. In addition, the patients admitted to ICU showed higher counts of white blood cell and neutrophil.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 266, "end": 269, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 412, "end": 415, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 628, "end": 631, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 787, "end": 791, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1012, "end": 1015, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2002, "end": 2005, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2071, "end": 2075, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2130, "end": 2134, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2217, "end": 2221, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2399, "end": 2403, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2404, "end": 2407, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2598, "end": 2601, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Our study has some similarity to a case reported during MERS-CoV outbreak.
