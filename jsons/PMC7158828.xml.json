            "text": "The Covid-19 pandemic, following the emergence of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in China early 2020, is disrupting entire communities and particularly healthcare professionals including ENT specialists, thus raising many ethical questions. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and several countries have already prepared these questions by taking ethics into account when planning management of a hypothetical global influenza pandemic [1], most of the time without being able to offer clear guidelines. In France, the National Consultative Ethics Committee (Comit\u00e9 consultatif national d\u2019\u00e9thique \u2013 CCNE) published a document in 2009 on \u201cthe ethical questions raised by a possible influenza pandemic\u201d, a text which served as the basis for the urgent drafting of a new document, published on March 13th, 2020 concerning the Covid-19 pandemic [2]. In this text, ten important points have been identified:\u2022a call for civic responsibility, in particular a discussion on the right of withdrawal in relation to duty and general public interest, and on the importance of limiting defiant attitudes (sometimes even from healthcare professionals);\u2022the political decision-making process based on committees including scientific experts and members of civil society;\u2022measures to temporarily restrict citizens\u2019 rights based on a solid legal framework, emphasising on public information and education;\u2022special attention to precarious populations;\u2022transparent and responsible communication;\u2022continued respect of health data confidentiality;\u2022taking into account the international context with a common health crisis management policy on a European scale;\u2022promotion of research in international partnerships;\u2022an appeal to the pharmaceutical industry;\u2022necessary ethical consideration to maintain access to healthcare for all patients (in particular, on the differential treatment of patients infected with Covid-19 and those with other pathologies).\n",

In the operating room, endonasal, upper airway and mastoid surgery are also particularly at risk. Insufficient availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) poses major ethical problems between taking appropriate care of patient and endangering ENTs and their teams doing so.",

Performing flexible nasal endoscopy in the office has become complicated with an insufficient availability of FFP2 masks. The risk for the patient is twofold, of delayed diagnosis and of increased contamination risk during transport for medical reasons. National recommendations also suggest cancelling any elective surgery that can be delayed by two months. However, this decision may be difficult to take in cases of progressive diseases, especially when collective decision-making is not possible, with a significant risk of post-crisis legal actions. Even oncology cases, although prioritised, are sometimes impacted to limit necessity of ICU or tracheostomy.",

The chloroquine controversy, often more an emotionally heated than scientific debate, has recently been at the forefront of discussions between patients and their ENTs and between colleagues, overshadowing other important issues. Conversely, the numerous recommendations posted online on the National French ORL Society (SFORL) website (https://www.sforl.org/actualites-Covid-19/) and the French National ENT Academy, with the participation of the French ORL National Syndicate (SNORL) and the French ORL National Professional Council (CNP ORL) are part of a transparent and up-to-date communication strategy at a national but also international level. Professional online forums such as Doc@Doc also allow information to be relayed and experiences to be crossed leading to notable scientific advances (as was the case for anosmia).",

To continue this reflection, the Ethics Committee of the CNP ORL (CEORL), currently being rehauled, is available to collect questions from ENTs and to reflect with the ENT community on these subjects. According to the different recommendations of the French scientific societies, the CEORL certainly remains available to review certain ethical choices, would ENT specialists require it, keeping in mind that it seems of paramount importance that decisions be taken within the local teams, on a case-by-case basis and depending on the local context, which can change rapidly.",
