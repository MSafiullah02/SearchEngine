The pathophysiology is believed to be idiopathic [2] or immune-mediated phenomenon with active destruction of haematopoietic stem cells [3]. The abnormal immune response may be elicited by environmental exposures, such as to chemicals, drugs, viral infections and endogenous antigens generated by genetically altered bone marrow cells [4]. A small fraction of the genes involved in pancytopenia has been represented by the congenital BM failure syndromes (relatively rare) which lately develop in clinical syndromes as Fanconi's anemia, Dyskeratosis Congenita, and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome [5,6].",

However, this syndrome has been reported in 2-5% cases of west and 4-10% in area of more prevalent to hepatitis and Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV) in the Far East [12,13], it belongs to the area of low socioeconomic status [14,15].

Majority of the cases have been found as fulminant where the mortality rate reaches up to 85% [17]. Aetiology of the syndrome has been attributed to various agents and factors [7] which may include pathogenic viruses, autoimmune responses, liver transplantation procedure [18] bone marrow transplantation, radiation [19] and drugs administered to control the viral replication [14].",

In one study Safadi and co-workers (2001) found out that sera of eight of the patients had the existence of Hepatitis Bc IgG and/or anti-HBs antibodies which was suggested due to past exposure and immunizing effect and they were unable to establish any direct relation with acute hepatitis B [14]. As non-A, non-B hepatitis agents are usually responsible for the hepatitis associated aplastic anemia; the prevalence of anti-hepatitis C virus antibodies is similar in HAAA and aplasia of other origins [25]. HCV seropositivity has been observed in the patients developing cytopenia following non-A non-B hepatitis (NANBH). HCV viremia has been frequently observed without detecting anti-HCV antibodies in patients' blood reflecting the transfusion associated HCV infection [25,26]. However, it has also been reported that HCV is not generally implicated as a causative agent of hepatitis preceding aplastic anemia [27].",

The residing of CD8 cells in bone marrow during HAAA produces a high level of interferon gamma (INF-\u03b3) and cells derived from bone marrow locating in liver may activate these cytotoxic T cells causing their intrahepatic accumulation strongly affected by the Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interferon gamma (INF-\u03b3) causing the onlooker damage to liver cell of genetically modified mouse model.

HAAA is mostly occurring in children and it would be easier to find the HLA matched donor. As HAAA shows poor prognosis, most often it has been treated by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [26,55]. Immunosuppressive therapy has proved effective after BM transplantation. Various immunosuppressive drugs named Antithymocyte Globulin (ATG) and Cyclosporine have been administered without eliciting any acute side effects. Steroids such as Glucocorticoids have also been employed in combination with immunosuppressive medications for the treatment of the HAA patients [26]. A durable remission from HAA has been achieved by the administrating high dose of Cyclophosphamide (CY), a highly immunosuppressive, which elicits its effect by readily destroying the lymphocytes and committed myeloid cells. The haemopoietic stem cells are not susceptible to the toxic effects of the CY due to releasing the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme which inactivates the drug. However, restoration of haematopoesis process may achieved by high dose of CY which mediates autoimmune attack on haematopoiectic stem cells HSCs [13].",

Antiviral therapy for treating hepatitis B associated HAAA has been unknown yet; however it has been tested by administrating the nucleoside analogs, lamiviudine, against the aplastic anemic secondary to hepatitis B virus infection and remission occurs from the severe aplastic anemia accompanied with the hepatitis B viral infection. Interferon, an effective therapy for the hepatitis B and C viral infections, cannot be employed as a potential approach for the HAAA because of its mylosuppressive effects [21]. Acyclovir has been used for the treatment of aplastic anemia caused by the Epstein Bar virus [32]. The blood count comes to the normal range after five years of treatment [55], however, chances of recovery from hepatitis associated acquired aplastic anemia is rare [57].",

This disorder has been reported in 2-5% cases in West, 4-10% in Far East and high in area of low socioeconomic status. HAAA is not related to age, sex and severity of hepatitis, predominantly it has been found in children, adolesecent boys and in young aged men. A number of hepatitis viruses manifest the disease symptoms. Amongst the hepatitis viruses, HBV, HCV and HGV seropositivity has been mostly commonly observed in reported cases of HAAA. The causative agent of HAAA can be detected using hematological, biochemical, immunological and virological markers. The clinical features relating to HAAA are pallor and multiple skin bleeding, lymphocytopenia, hypogammaglobulin, low number of CD8/T cell ratio and increased number of cytotoxic cells, neutropenia and fever etc. For HAAA, immunosuppressive therapy is more effective after BM transplantation.",
