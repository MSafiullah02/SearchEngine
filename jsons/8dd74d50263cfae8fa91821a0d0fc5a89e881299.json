Disease-causing microorganisms are called pathogens. Infection is the process in which the microorganism multiplies or grows in or on the host. Infection does not necessarily result in disease since it is possible for the organism to grow in or on the host without producing an illness (see Chapter 29). In the case of enteric infections (i.e., diarrhea) caused by Salmonella , only half of the individuals infected develop clinical signs of illness. A frank pathogen is a microorganism capable of producing disease in either normal healthy or immunocompromised persons. Opportunistic pathogens are usually capable of causing infections only in immunocompromised individuals (burn patients, patients taking antibiotics, those with impaired immune systems, elderly patients with diabetes, etc.). Opportunistic pathogens are common in the environment and may be present in the human gut or skin, but normally do not cause disease.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "To cause illness, the pathogen must usually first grow within or on the host. The time between infection and the appearance of clinical signs and symptoms such as diarrhea, fever or rash, is the incubation time ( Table 22 .1 ). This may range from as short as 6-12 h in the case of Norwalk virus diarrhea to 30-60 days for hepatitis A virus, which causes liver disease. At any time during infection, the pathogen may be released into the environment by the host through feces, urine, or respiratory secretions. Although the maximum release may occur at the height of the disease, it may also precede the first signs of clinical illness. In the case of hepatitis A virus, the maximum excretion in the feces occurs before the onset of signs of clinical illness. The concentration of organisms released into the environment varies with the type of organism and the route of transmission ( Table  22 .2 ). The concentration of enteric viruses during gastroenteritis may be as high as 10 10 -10 12 per gram of feces.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 211, "end": 221, "text": "( Table 22", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 884, "end": 895, "text": "( Table  22", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": ""}, {"text": "Pathogenic microorganisms usually originate from an infected host (either human or other animal) or directly from the environment. Many human pathogens can be transmitted only by direct or close contact with an infected person or animal. Examples include the herpesvirus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonorrhea), and Treponema pallidum (syphilis). This is because their survival time outside the host is very brief. Pathogens transmitted through the environment may survive from hours to years outside the host, depending on the organism and the environment. Pathogens may exit a host in respiratory secretions from the nose and mouth or be shed on dead skin or in feces, urine, saliva, or tears. Thus they may contaminate the air, water, food, or inanimate objects (fomites). When contaminated air is inhaled or food consumed, the organisms are effectively transmitted to another host, where the infection process begins again. Airborne transmission can occur via release from the host in droplets (i.e., coughing) or through natural (surf at a beach) or human activities (cooling towers, showers) (see Chapter 5). Some organisms may be carried great distances, hundreds of meters or miles (e.g., Legionnaires ' disease and foot-and-mouth disease). Virus transmission by the airborne route may be both direct and indirect. Infection of a host may be by direct inhalation of infectious droplets or through contact with fomites on which the airborne droplets have settled. Hand or mouth contact with the organism on the surface of a fomite results in the transfer of the organism to the portal of entry, that is, nose, mouth, or eye.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": ""}, {"text": "Microorganisms transmitted by the fecal-oral route are usually referred to as enteric pathogens because they infect the gastrointestinal tract.

The classic waterborne diseases, cholera and typhoid fever, which frequently ravaged densely populated areas throughout human history, have been effectively controlled by the protection of water sources and by treatment of contaminated water supplies. In fact, the control of these classic diseases illustrated the importance of water supply treatment and played an important role in the reduction of infectious diseases. Other diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths may also be transmitted by contaminated drinking water.

Typhoid fever presents a very different clinical picture than salmonellosis. The onset of typhoid fever (one to three weeks) is usually insidious, with fever, headache, anorexia, enlarged spleen, coughing, and constipation being more common than diarrhea in adults.

Protozoa are unicellular microorganisms in the kingdom Protista and are classified according to their means of locomotion: flagella, cilia, pseudopodia, or no locomotion. Some are parasitic, although the majority are nonparasitic. Some undergo a sexual stage, whereas others reproduce by asexual means: fission, budding, or schizogony. Helminths belong to the kingdom Animalia and include roundworms, flatworms, tapeworms, and flukes. They are multicellular, complex organisms containing organs and tissue.
