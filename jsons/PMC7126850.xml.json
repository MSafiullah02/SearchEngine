            "text": "Post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) and edema disease are common pathological conditions affecting piglets (Rhouma et al., 2017a). Various Escherichia coli strains cause these diseases. Indeed, different serogroups (O138, O139, O141, O149, O157\u2026), adhesive factors (F4 (K88), F8, AIDA, Eae\u2026), and other virulence factors (enterotoxins LT, STa, STb, EAST\u2026) have been reported in these strains (Fairbrother and Gyles, 2012). The control of these infections must be based primarily on optimizing breeding management of the weaning piglets so as to avoid, insofar as possible, stressful conditions as they are separated from the sow, transported, mixed, placed in a new environment and provided with new feed. Prophylactic measures may also include vaccination of the sow (Rhouma et al., 2017a). However, these measures may be ineffective in preventing digestive troubles, and in the past, orally administered antimicrobials were almost systematically used to control colibacillosis. As a result, E. coli strains have developed antimicrobial resistance, particularly to the most frequently administered molecules. Of note, resistance to colistin (CST) had been detected at relatively low levels for years in commensal isolates, but prevalence was sometimes high for pathogenic strains (Kempf et al., 2016), and after a publication on the emerging mcr-1 gene in China (Liu et al., 2016), it soon appeared that this gene was also present in many other countries, particularly in pig E. coli strains (Kempf et al., 2016). As these strains are frequently also resistant to many other antimicrobials (Delannoy et al., 2017), it became necessary to develop and evaluate novel control products or measures. To our knowledge, experimental models of colibacillosis in piglets have been developed with inoculation of CST-susceptible E. coli (Madec et al., 2000; Rhouma et al., 2016, 2017b) but not with CST-resistant strains. However we believe that such models are needed to evaluate the impact or the efficacy of antimicrobials, including colistin, and alternative strategies on infections caused by strains with resistance or reduced susceptibilities to a number of molecules. Furthermore, it has been shown that acquisition and expression of the mcr-1 gene in a E. coli cell may result in gross morphological changes, including cell membrane impairment, and reduced fitness and attenuated virulence in a Galleria mellonella model. Moreover the mcr-1 mediated LPS modification reduces the stimulation of macrophages, and a lower production of IL-6 and TNF was induced with LPS extracted from mcr-1 strains compared to control LPS (Yang et al., 2017). Thus because of these potential differences of susceptibility and virulence of mcr-1 strains, we decided to develop an experimental model of colibacillosis in weaned piglets using multi-drug-resistant E. coli strains isolated from clinical cases and carrying the mcr-1 gene.",

The intent was to choose strains representative of CST-resistant isolates obtained from piglets with PWD. All three strains were hemolytic. Strains 12\u2013246, 12\u2013269, and 13\u2013220 belonged to phylogenetic groups (PGG) A, A, and E, and had markers O141-F18, O149-F4, and O139-F18 respectively. All three strains were resistant to colistin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, tetracycline, and ampicillin.

One hundred microliters of decimal dilutions were inoculated using EasySpiral\u00ae Dilute (Interscience, Saint-Nom-la-Bret\u00e8che, France) onto MacConkey media supplemented with rifampicin (250 mg/L) and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C.

The limit of detection was 100 CFU without enrichment and 50 CFU/g after enrichment. Whenever possible, two colonies (from samples positive only after enrichment) or three colonies (from samples positive without enrichment) per sample were stored. PCR was used to confirm that they belonged to the E. coli species (Bej et al., 1991), to detect the presence of the mcr-1 gene (Liu et al., 2016), and to determine their phylogenetic group (Clermont et al., 2013). For isolates which did not exhibit the expected results (presence of mcr-1 and phylogenetic group of the inoculated strain), ERIC-PCR (Rivera et al., 1995) and PFGE profiles (Ribot et al., 2006) after digestion with XbaI were studied. The susceptibility of some of these isolates was compared to the susceptibility of the inoculated strains by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) using a broth microdilution method on EUVSEC plates (Sensititre, ThermoFisher Scientific, Dardilly, France).",

O141:F18 12\u2013246 M is of type ST-10, which has already been isolated from many different sources, such as humans, animals (including swine in Italy and China), food (including pork in the USA) and the environment (water in France) (http://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/species/ecoli/search_strains). An ST-10 mcr-1 and bla\nNDM-5\nE. coli of human origin was also characterized by Zhang et al.

The O139:F18 13\u2013220 M strain belongs to ST-1, like O139:F18 isolates obtained from pig diarrhea in Hungary in 1988 (http://enterobase.warwick.ac.uk/species/ecoli/search_strains\n?query=st_search).

This group also had the highest excretion titers in the first week, and more fecal samples were found positive. However, at necropsy\u2014more than one month after inoculation\u2014the O149:F4+ inoculated strain was less frequently isolated than the other two inoculated strains, both of type F18+\nfimbriae. This may be related to the fact that susceptibility to F18+ or F4+\nE. coli may vary with the pig\u2019s age. Verdonck et al. (Verdonck et al., 2002) previously observed a similar delay, with F4+ ETEC peak excretion 2 days post-infection (PI), but no excretion 7 days PI, in contrast to the peak excretion of F18+ VTEC infection observed between 3 and 5 days PI, and excretion persisting up to 9 days PI. Interestingly, in group G3, the only two pigs found to be genetically resistant to E. coli F4 had no diarrhea and gave only a total of eight positive fecal samples out of 26, whereas 47 out of 77 samples were positive for the six pigs which were genetically susceptible to E. coli F4 (P = 0.007); their mean log10 titer was 0.6 compared to a mean of 3.0 (P = 0.0004) for the other pigs in group G3. Although all the pigs were genetically susceptible to E. coli F18, the symptoms remained relatively moderate in groups G2 and G4. The experimental model could be improved by using higher inocula doses, intra-gastric inoculation, withdrawing feed before inoculation, cold stress, pretreatment with antibiotics, co-inoculation of viruses, or inoculating piglets when younger (Madec et al., 2000), or using pigs known to be genetically susceptible to the inoculated strains. It is acknowledged that post-weaning digestive disorders are generally encountered in inadequate breeding conditions, contrary to the high-standard environment offered to our weaning piglets.",

The use of colistin-supplemented media was used to try to detect the transfer of the mcr-1 gene from the inoculated strains to commensal ones. Detection of the mcr-1 gene in colistin-enrichment broths was also performed but the sensitivity of this method was poor as previously observed in experiments with pigs inoculated with a commensal mcr-1-positive E. coli strain (Mourand et al., 2018), and needs further improvements. The three inoculated strains could be recovered from fecal and post-mortem samples up to four and five weeks respectively after inoculation. For group G4 only, a few isolates carrying the mcr-1 gene were also obtained, but their other characteristics (phylogenetic group, PFGE or ERIC-PCR profiles, and antimicrobial susceptibility) were different from those of the inoculated strain. As no mcr-1-containing E. coli was present in the non-inoculated animals, the uncharacteristic isolates are very probably commensal isolates having acquired the mcr-1 gene or plasmid from E. coli 13\u2013220 M. Other analyses are necessary to determine the precise mechanisms of this transfer, which can occur through either conjugation or transposon mobilization. Interestingly, in vitro, the mcr-1 gene was shown to be on a conjugative plasmid in E. coli 13\u2013220, but not in E. coli 12\u2013246 or E. coli 12\u2013269. The transconjugant obtained in vitro from E. coli 13\u2013220 acquired resistance to colistin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Different studies have shown that the in vitro acquisition of an mcr-1-containing plasmid does not lead to a considerable fitness cost in E. coli as measured by growth kinetics, cytotoxicity, and virulence in a Galleria mellonella model (Tietgen et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017), but a high level of mcr-1 expression compromises growth rate, fitness, and the membrane\u2019s structural integrity while increasing cellular death (Yang et al., 2017). In our experiment, most isolates from samples collected from the E. coli 13\u2013220 M-inoculated pigs shared the characteristics of this strain, suggesting that the commensal strains which had acquired the mcr-1 gene were perhaps not as competitive as E. coli 13\u2013220 M.",

Wu et al. (2018) studied the stability of various mcr-1-harboring plasmids and showed that the IncHI2, IncI2, IncX4 and IncY plasmids were maintained after 14 days of passage in a colistin-free medium, but the IncFII plasmid was lost from the E. coli DH5alpha transformant after day 5. The in vivo loss of the mcr-1 gene has already been detected for other strains (Mourand et al., 2018). Interestingly, the loss of the mcr-1 gene was not accompanied by a loss of resistance to colistin for 12\u2013246 M, suggesting that the previously described deletion in the PmrB protein, or other unnoticed mutations, probably played a role in colistin resistance. For E. coli 12\u2013269 M, the isolates lacking mcr-1 were no longer resistant to colistin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and ampicillin, suggesting that these resistance genes may be present on the same genetic element, but further analysis is needed to confirm this hypothesis, as the genes were present on contigs different from the mcr-1 contig. The loss of the colistin resistance consecutive to the absence of the mcr-1 gene also suggests that the previously detected PhoQ and PhoP mutations (Delannoy et al., 2017) have probably no impact on colistin resistance). Finally in group G4, the isolate lacking the mcr-1 gene had only lost colistin resistance.",
