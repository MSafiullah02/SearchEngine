In this research we study the epidemic patterns of this virus, from a mathematical modeling perspective. The study is based on endemic extensions of the well-known susceptibleinfected-recovered (SIR) family of compartmental models. It is shown how social measures such as distancing, regional lockdowns, quarantine and global public health vigilance, influence the model parameters, which can eventually change the mortality rates and active contaminated cases over time, in the real world. As with all mathematical models, the predictive ability of the model is limited by the accuracy of the available data and to the so-called level of abstraction used for modeling the problem. In order to provide the broader audience of researchers a better understanding of spreading patterns of epidemic diseases, a short introduction on biological systems modeling is also presented and the Matlab source codes for the simulations are provided online.",

By March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the situation a pandemic, the first of its kind in our generation. To date, many countries and regions have been locked-down and applied strict social distancing measures to stop the virus propagation. From a strategic and healthcare management perspective, the propagation pattern of the disease and the prediction of its spread over time is of great importance, to save lives and to minimize the social and economic consequences of the disease.

In choosing among different available models, the widely accepted principle is the model parsimony, which simply means that \"a model should be as simple as possible and as complex as necessary!\". The model parsimony, is also an important factor for estimating the unknown model parameters using real data. A more accurate model with fewer number of parameters is evidently preferred over a less accurate and more complex model. But how should one select between a more accurate complex model and a less accurate simpler one? Measures such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and the minimum description length (MDL), address the balance between the number of observations and the model unknown parameters to select between competing models with variable number of parameters and different levels of accuracy [8] , [9] . Finally, the physical interpretability of the model parameters and the ability to estimate the parameters such that the model matches real-world data, is what makes the whole modeling framework meaningful.",

The major application of these equations is when the rate of change of a variable is related to other variables, as it is so in most physical and biological systems. Many powerful mathematical tools exist for the analysis and (numerical) solution of models based on differential equations. Despite their vast applications, differential equations are difficult to conceive and interpret without visualization. In this context, compartmental models are used as a visual means of representing differential equations of dynamic systems. A compartment is an abstract entity representing the quantity of interest (volume, number, density, etc.). Depending on the level of abstraction, each of the variables of interest (equivalent to system states in dynamic systems) are represented by a single compartment, conceptually represented by a box. Each compartment is assumed to be internally homogeneous, which implies that all entities assumed inside the compartment are indistinguishable. For example, depending on the model complexity selected for modeling a certain epidemic disease, men and women at risk can be assumed to conform a single compartment, or may alternatively be considered as different compartments. A similar partitioning may be considered for different age groups, ethnicities, countries, etc., at a cost of a more complex (less parsimonious) model with additional states and parameters to be identified. Apparently, the available realworld data may be insufficient for the parameter identification of a more detailed (complex) model.",

More technically, a compartmental model is a weighted directed graph representation of a dynamic system. Each compartment corresponds to a node of the graph and the linking arrows are the graph edges. From this perspective, for an n compartment system, the compartment variables can be considered as state variables denoted in vector form as x(t) = [x 1 (t), . . . , x n (t)] T .

These variables are the state variables of the resulting state-space equations. 2) Linking the compartments with arrows indicating the rate of quantity flow from each compartment to another (visually denoted over the arrows connecting the compartments). 3) Writing the corresponding first-order (linear or nonlinear) differential equations for each of the state variables of the model. In writing the equations from the graph representation, the edge weights multiplied by the state variable of their start node are added to (subtracted from) the rate change equation of the end node (start node).

The numerical solution of a basic (non-endemic) SIR model is shown in Fig. 3 , with and without lifetime immunity. The time-step for numerical discretizing of the differential equations of this simulation has been chosen to be \u2206=0.1 of a day. Notice how the outbreak of a disease that does not cause lifetime immunity (such as a typical flu), can result in a constant rate of illness throughout time, after its transient period. For widespread epidemic diseases, the healthcare strategists are interested in the slopes of s(t), i(t) and r(t), rather than the total number of infected individuals (as it is currently the case for the COVID-19 Coronavirus). The prolongation of the disease spread provides the better management of healthcare resources such as hospitalization, medication, healthcare personnel, etc. For later reference, it is interesting to study the fixed-point of the SIR model (where\u1e61(t) =i(t) =\u1e59(t) = 0). Equating the left sides of (4) with zero, it can be algebraically shown that if \u03b1, \u03b3 = 0 (the non-immunizing case), the SIR model has only two fixed-points:",

The experience of the COVID-19 shows that a two-week incubation period can spread a virus worldwide and almost at any level of the society. Remember that any two of us are only six handshakes apart! 1 For this reason, an additional compartment is added between the susceptibility and infection stages of the SIR model, which accounts for the symptomless exposed subjects. Moreover, since we are also interested in minimizing the mortality rate of the disease, a termination compartment is dedicated to the passed-away population.

But it gives an idea about how the parameters can be tuned in practice, up to a reasonable order of magnitude. With this background, we now explain the interpretation of each parameter of the model. 1) \u03ba: The rate at which symptoms appear in exposed cases, resulting in transition from the exposed to the infected population. The selection of this parameter is according to the exponential law detailed above. We should add that wide screening policies adopted by certain countries (such as Germany, in the case of the Coronavirus), are external factors that can significantly accelerate the identification of the infected cases. In this case, screening is a factor that increases \u03ba. 2) \u03b1 i : The contagion factor between the infected and susceptible populations, which is related to the contagiousness of the virus and social factors such as personal hygiene, population density and level of human interactions. In order to find the range (or order of magnitude) of this parameter, we can start with the contagion factors of more known viruses, such as flu and influenza, which are more or less influenced by the same spreading factors. 3) \u03b1 e : The contagion factor between the exposed and susceptible populations. This parameter is logically far greater than \u03b1 i , since in ordinary conditions (before lock-downs and quarantine), people rarely avoid contact with a symptomless individual; nor does the individual itself avoid interaction with others. 4) \u03b3: The reinfection rate, or the rate of returning from the recovered group to the susceptible group. This happens for the cases that the body does not develop lifetime immunity after recovery, or the virus itself starts to mutate over time. This parameter is the inverse of the immunity rate of the virus. It is currently too early to comment about the immunity characteristics of the Coronavirus 2 . Although at least one case of reinfection soon after recovery has been reported, preliminary research have suggested short-term immunity of up to four months. 5) \u03b2: The recovery rate of the infected cases.

Specifically, by fitting the model over real data, the prediction of infection and mortality rates under quarantine and vaccination, and the study of the recurrent pattern of the epidemic disease over time. Non-exponential law infection distributions have also been considered in the literature [17] . This can be an interesting track of research for the study of epidemic diseases, including the family of Coronaviruses.",

A compartmental model is time-invariant (time-variant), when its rate flow factors are independent (dependent) of time. Compartmental models may be open or closed. In closed systems, the quantities are only passed between the compartments, while in open systems the quantities may flow into or out of the whole system.
