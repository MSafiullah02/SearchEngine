In the USA alone, almost 1.6 million patients require antiretroviral therapy, while in many developing countries this number is an order of magnitude greater.1 To date 25 antiretroviral drugs have been approved for the treatment of HIV infection using \u2018highly active antiretroviral therapy\u2019 or HAART.2 These compounds inhibit HIV replication, however their use is often hampered by toxic side-effects over long periods of therapy, as well as a loss of activity when faced with emerging drug-resistant virus strains. As a result, the search for new therapeutics with minimal side-effects and the ability to retain activity against drug-resistant virus strains is regarded as a critical goal for medicinal chemists.",

These compounds are highly specific, non-competitive inhibitors of HIV-1 RT, the key enzyme involved in HIV replication. Since 1996, five NNRTIs (shown in Fig. 1\n) have been approved by the FDA for clinical use: nevirapine (Viramune\u00ae, Boehringer Ingelheim), delavirdine (Rescriptor\u00ae, Pharmacia & UpJohn), and efavirenz (Sustiva\u00ae, DuPont) are classified as first generation NNRTIs, whereas etravirine (Intelence\u00ae, Tibotec) and rilpivirine (TMC278, Tibotec) are considered as second-generation NNRTIs, since they retain activity against a variety of drug-resistant virus strains.3 NNRTIs have been reported to bind to a non-nucleoside inhibitor binding pocket in HIV-1 RT (NNIBP), which is located in the \u2018palm\u2019 domain of the p66 subunit at a distance of approximately 10 \u00c5 from the enzyme catalytic site.4, 5 The pocket is primarily hydrophobic and key amino acid residues involved in inhibitor binding include aromatic (Y181, Y188, F227, W229 and Y232), hydrophobic (P59, L100, V106, V179, F227, L234 and P236) and hydrophilic (K101, K103, S105, D132 and E224) residues in the p66 RT subunit, as well as three additional amino acids (I135, E138 and T139) in the p51 subunit.3, 6 One major limitation of many NNRTIs however, is the rapid emergence of HIV-1 variants resistant to these drugs due to one or more point mutations in the RT binding site.",

Uracil analogues with various substituents in the C-6 position such as exemplified in scaffold 1 (Fig. 2) have proven to be fruitful leads for further development. Many of these analogues, for example, the 6-phenylthio-10, 11, 6-phenyl\u2013selenyl-12, 13, 14, 6-phenoxy-15, 16, 6-benzyl-17, 18, 19, and 6-benzoyluracil-15, 16, 20 derivatives such as those shown in Figure 2 have been shown to inhibit HIV replication in cell culture in nanomolar concentrations.

On the one hand, substitution of the methyl group of 2-(2-(3,5-dimethyl)benzylphenoxy)ethyl uracil with a chlorine or bromine had almost no effect on the potency of the compounds (8 vs 9 and 10). However the same substitution on the benzophenone-containing compounds led to a marked enhancement of activity. The inhibitors bearing chlorine or bromine in R3 position inhibited RT in lower concentrations in comparison to their counterparts with methyl or fluorine substituents (13 and 14 vs 11 and 12, or 17 and 18 vs 16). It is notable that these results are in agreement with the anti-HIV activity observed for the uracil derivatives.",

While these data do not directly support the results of the antiviral activity studies, which revealed different resistance susceptibility profiles for the structurally-related benzophenones 17 and 20, it is possible that this difference is due to differences in solubility for some of the compounds in aqueous media, rather than to a different mode of interaction with mutant HIV\u2013RTs.",

It was found that the maximum concentration of the compounds bearing halogens (including 17 and 20) could not exceed 2\u20133 \u03bcM in 10% DMSO solution (Supplementary data, Table S2). Assuming that the resistance index of the compounds 17\u201319 against K103N + Y181C HIV-1 strain is 50\u2013200 as was shown for benzophenones 20, 24, and 25, they should display antiviral activity against this strain at micromolar concentrations, that is, in the same range as they tend to precipitate.

            "text": "Herein we have described the synthesis, SAR, and biological evaluation of a series of potential NNRTI anti-HIV agents. Several of the uracil derivatives exhibited potent antiviral activity in infected cell culture and effectively inhibited recombinant HIV\u2013RT. Notably, the compounds did not exhibit toxicity in cell culture, and thus have high selectivity indices. Two of the uracil derivatives effectively inhibited several mutant HIV-1 RTs and also partially retained antiviral activity against several drug-resistant HIV strains. Despite these encouraging results, the poor solubility of some of the compounds hindered true assessment of their potential biological activity. Although the activity levels of the compounds towards wild-type virus and HIV-1 RT were similar to that of nevirapine, they more closely resemble the activity profile of efavirenz by retaining their inhibitory activity towards mutant RT forms resistant to nevirapine. Given the promising and potent antiviral activity exhibited by these compounds, it is clear that the benzophenone-linked uracil scaffold is an excellent lead for the development of additional compounds. As a result, current efforts are underway to improve the solubility of some of the more insoluble compounds in order to design more effective anti-HIV drugs. Those results will be reported elsewhere as they become available.",
