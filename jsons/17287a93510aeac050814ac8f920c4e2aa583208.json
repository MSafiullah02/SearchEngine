Method: A short course, including an introductory lecture and a three component competency based assessment exercise testing student's knowledge and ability in infection control measures was incorporated into the previously established training programme. The assessment exercises included a written test of students' knowledge of the Infection Control Policy, a unit management exercise and a hand hygiene assessment. The infection control competency was initially incorporated into the final term of the second year in 2004 and is now an established part of the 5-year dental undergraduate degree programme. Re-assessments were scheduled (at the start of third year) for students failing to meet the required standard as successful completion of this course was compulsory prior to students being allowed to treat their first patients. Student performance over the last 2 years on this course and during their first year on clinic were analysed to determine potential improvements in student knowledge and application in infection control. Examination results from the year 3, infection control spot test were compared with those of earlier years. In addition, the opinions, as assessed by questionnaire analysis, of dental staff and students on the infection control competency were obtained.",

Significant improvements were seen in students passing the course at their initial attempt, 42% and 78%, in the 2004 and 2005 academic years, respectively. Also subsequent testing of these students during their first year on clinic showed marked increases in awareness and knowledge of the infection control protocols. Staff and student feedback on this course was also found to be highly supportive of the introduction of the infection control competency. Conclusion: Incorporation of additional formal pre-clinical teaching and introduction of an infection competency potentially provides enduring knowledge and clinical application benefits.",

Pathogenic microorganisms have the potential to be transmitted in dental settings through (1) direct contact with blood, oral fluids, or other patient materials; (2) indirect contact with contaminated objects (e.g. instruments, equipment or surfaces); (3) contact of conjunctival, nasal, or oral mucosa with droplets containing microorganisms (aerosols) generated from an infected person and propelled by coughing, sneezing, talking or use of dental instruments, e.g. sonic/ultrasonic scalers; and (4) inhalation of airborne microorganisms that can remain in the environment for long periods (7) . It is therefore necessary that infection control procedures address issues of hand hygiene, instrument sterilisation, sharps handling and the use of protective barriers.",

Indeed, UK General Dental Council (GDC) guidelines state that dental graduates should be able to 'implement and perform satisfactory infection control and prevent physical, chemical or microbiological contamination in the practice of dentistry' (11) . In addition, the generation of qualified dentists educated in infection control procedures is important in extending compliance in private dental practices within the community. Employing dentists not only have a responsibility to protect patients, but are also required to provide a safe environment for their employees by ensuring staff immunisations, eye and face protection, surgery clothing, protection against saliva/blood splatter and inoculation injuries. Indeed, 'failure to employ adequate methods of crossinfection control would almost certainly render a dentist liable to a charge of serious professional misconduct' (12). Whilst an effective infection control programme and concerns over transmission of disease has always been an essential and integral part of the dental practice, over the past decade, guidelines for infection control have become more evidence-based, enabling strategies to be devised which can prevent disease transmission by interrupting one or more links in the chain of contamination.",

Students' infection control performance was continually assessed by dental and nursing staff during treatment clinics in years 3, 4 and 5, and formal assessment of student knowledge and skills in this area was determined by Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) in year 4 and written professional examinations in year 5 ( Fig. 1) .",

Prior to implementation students were initially informed of these teaching changes and provided with clear learning outcomes via a lecture with additional reinforcement of this information provided both by email and written memo. Student competency in infection control was determined by a three Competency assessment in the dental curriculum component assessment which included; (a) a written test, covering the key points in the 'Hospital Infection Control Policy' (Fig. 2) ; (b) a hand hygiene exercise, where, following instruction on correct hand washing technique, students' were assessed on their ability to wash their hands to a satisfactory standard using the 'Glitterbug' (http://www.arrowscientific.com.au/ glitterbug.html) hand-washing system [efficient removal of the 'GlitterBug' (fluorescent dye) was determined by ultra-violet light illumination and competency required complete removal of fluorescent dye as determined by a single examiner, using predetermined criteria]; (c) a unit management exercise which assessed students on their ability to (i) decontaminate and set-up a unit prior to treatment of their first patient, and (ii) demonstrate the correct procedure for oiling dental hand pieces (Fig. 3 ). On discussion with teaching and support staff these areas were selected as procedures that were core to infection control and which all new clinical students needed to master prior to treating patients on clinic. As this competency course assessment evolves the incorporation of other procedures will also be considered (e.g. handling of sharps). The infection control competency tests were performed over a 2-day period with half of the student cohort (n \u00bc 67 in 2004 and n \u00bc 73 in 2005) examined on each day. Student groups (n \u00bc 10-12) were rotated through each component and allowed 30 min to complete each of the three exercises. Supervision was provided by dental and senior nursing staff. To ensure consistency in student assessment a single trained examiner was used for the hand hygiene exercise and the written test, and a marking sheet was provided for the unit management exercise listing key aspects of unit set-up (Fig. 3) . Results were collated and the students' subsequently notified of their performance. Students who passed all three components were deemed competent whilst students failing any component of the infection control competency were reassessed. An immediate re-test was provided for students failing the hand hygiene exercise whilst retests for the written assessment and unit management exercise were scheduled at the beginning of the autumn term of year 3 (Fig. 1) . All students were required to have successfully completed all components of the infection control competency course prior to being allowed to treat patients on dental clinics.",

It shows that significant improvements were seen in students' results in the already established infection control spot test. In addition positive student and staff questionnaire feedback was received which indicated increased student knowledge and application in this area. It is possible that these results were achieved due to increased student understanding of the rationale for compliance with the infection control programme due to the incorporation of additional teaching. It was also notable that significantly more students passed the infection control competency test in the second year of its implementation and that there was also a marked improvement in student performance. Potentially, these results could be explicable by improved teaching of the course during its second iteration and/or the students being more aware of the need to successfully complete it prior to progression onto their clinical training, both of which indicate enhanced knowledge of infection control in patient management within the student body.",

New pathogens and risk areas constantly emerge, and as a result, infection control recommendations and guidelines are constantly changing to adapt to the new evidence base, so it is essential to have a dynamic and modifiable undergraduate curriculum. Thorough training of our undergraduate dental students in infection control is a necessity and areas that could potentially be perceived as trivial by the student cohort require particular attention. Indeed, hand hygiene may possibly represent one such area. Recent studies have shown hand hygiene to be the single most critical measure for reducing the risk of transmitting organisms (2) between patients and dental staff and in particular for controlling the spread of multi-resistant organisms. Clearly, the aim of hand hygiene procedures is to eliminate transient microflora and reduce resident microflora for the duration of the dental procedure as skin bacteria are capable of rapidly multiplying under surgical gloves if hands are not washed thoroughly with antimicrobial soap (18) (19) (20) (21) . It is therefore imperative for students to learn and adhere to high levels of hand hygiene to avoid the potential of pathogens contaminating the operator's hands during dental procedures or entering the oral cavity through torn gloves. Within the preparation of the dental unit test (Fig. 3) , we highlighted the need for careful decontamination. Specifically, we reinforced the need to ensure thorough flushing of dental unit waterlines and sterilisation of dental hand pieces and other devices. Previous studies have demonstrated that dental unit waterlines can become colonised with a variety of pathogenic microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and protozoa which potentially pose an epidemiologic risk (22) (23) (24) (25) . Dental hand pieces and other devices can also retain infectious material with the potential to subsequently transmit disease. A recent study of general dental practitioners within the UK found issues relating to instrument decontamination (26) . Indeed, recently 4089 patients from a dental clinic in Scotland were contacted due to a dentists admission of periodic use of unsterilised equipment. Subsequently, 1005 patients were screened for HBV, HCV and HIV although the investigation found no evidence of patient-to-patient transmission (27) . A separate report however did demonstrate that patient-to-patient transmission of HBV via contaminated instruments has occurred (28) .",

            "text": "It is important to be aware of pedagogical factors central to the delivery of the infection control course which may enhance the student learning experience and aid knowledge application. The incorporation of the infection control competency at this time-point within the undergraduate curriculum potentially provides benefits as it ensured students were already introduced to the subject matter. Such adequate prior knowledge has been shown to be an important prerequisite for successful learning (29, 30) . In addition, the varied modes of delivery of the teaching of the infection control competency course, including the didactic lecturing, student centred learning and 'hands-on' application, can potentially enhance student interest and facilitate a 'deep' learning approach to the subject (31); however, follow up of subsequent student cohorts will be required to confirm these findings. The limiting of student class size during the infection control competency exercise facilitates student centred teaching, enabling active engagement of the students in the learning process (13) . Combined, these approaches should assist a 'deep' rather than a 'surface' learning, enabling subsequent application of knowledge (32, 31) . Whilst it is assured that our modified curriculum will continue to guarantee all dental students have a sufficient level of knowledge to enable safe management of patients, it will be of interest to monitor the performance of the student cohorts in the latter years of the dental undergraduate course. Our preliminary data indicates potential improvements in student awareness and application and therefore it is conceivable that these benefits may be apparent in infection control assessment exercises, such as OSCE, and also importantly, during clinical procedures. Indeed it is proposed that further information will be gathered to determine any long-term benefit in infection control performance, as the students progress through the course.",
