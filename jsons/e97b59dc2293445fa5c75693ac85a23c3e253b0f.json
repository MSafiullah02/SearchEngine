It is already indicated in patients with COVID-19 and worsening respiratory status. The rapid spread of the pandemic to all continents, albeit with a nonuniform community transmission, necessitates chest imaging for medical triage of patients presenting moderate-severe clinical COVID-19 features. This paper reports the development of innovative machine learning schemes for the analysis of Chest X-Ray (CXR) scan images of COVID-19 patients in almost real-time, demonstrating significantly high accuracy in identifying COVID-19 infection. The performance testing was conducted on a combined dataset comprising CXRs of positive COVID-19 patients, patients with various viral and bacterial infections, as well as persons with a clear chest. The test resulted in successfully distinguishing CXR COVID-19 infection from the other cases with an average accuracy of 94.43%, sensitivity 95% and specificity 93.86%.",

Since December 2019 to third of May 2020, over 3.3 million cases were globally reported [1] . Despite the enormity of the present challenge, the impact of a century of gigantic advances in science, medicine and technology is manifested by the emergence of a globally adopted strategy to ensure significantly lower level of casualties. This strategy is based on (a) developing faster and more accurate diagnostic methods, (b) conducting clinical trials on possible drug treatments, and (c) developing and producing appropriate vaccines. With increasing prevalence of the disease and the nature of the outbreak, the priority is to scale up public health testing while developing new means of testing. Molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 using real-time RT-PCR test is the preferred screening/testing method [2] . While laboratorybased performance evaluations of RT-PCR test show high analytical sensitivity and nearperfect specificity with no misidentification of other coronaviruses or common respiratory pathogens, test sensitivity in clinical practice may be adversely affected by a number of variables including: adequacy of specimen, specimen type and handling, stage of infection (CDC guidelines for in-vitro diagnostics). Indeed, early reports of test performance in the Wuhan outbreak showed variable sensitivities ranging from 37% to 71% ( [3] , [4] ).",

Unlike the RT-PCR, these tests are not diagnostic testy but are meant to help estimate the proportion of the population that have had the infection and developed antibodies to it. However, recently doubts have been raised about the reliability of antibody tests. The World Health Organization's head of emerging diseases (Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove) said that while these tests measure the level of antibodies in the blood, there is no evidence they can show \"that an individual is immune or is protected against re-infection\". According to WHO, only a tiny proportion of the global populationmaybe as few as 2% or 3%appear to have antibodies in the blood showing they have been infected with COVID-19. Interested readers can find more on these issues from a variety of web reports (e.g. see [5] , [6] ).",

This paper is a follow up on our COVID-19 infection detection by texture analysis CT scan images where the FFT-Gabor scheme achieved accuracy in-excess of 95%. The choice of using CXR instead of CT (standard and Low dose) is due to the significant differences in the harmful ionising radiation dose (0.1 mSv for CXR compared to 7 mSv for standard CT and 1.5 mSv for LDCT). Consequently, CXR is a much safer option.",

The LBP-Gabor filters attained the highest and stable accuracy of 94.15% with equally impressive near equal sensitivity and specificity rates. Decision level fusion of all texture features resulted in average accuracies close to 95%, and higher than those by the individual features. These results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of the LBP transform domain to extracted features for the stated task. We have also observed the possibility of using the LBP-Gabor filtered sub-images as an additional visual evidence of the predicted decision within clinical setting. Due to the promising results, we are currently testing LBP-Gabor and FFT-Gabor texture features for Lung tumour detection.",

The additional visible features are reflected as artefacts that must have been caused by X-Rays detectible infection-caused changes in the chest and airways. These observations are clearly illustrated in the appendix displayed images, especially in the offdiagonal top-left Gabor sub-images. These artefacts are not hardly visible in the normal CXRs. Moreover, we observe notable differences in the extent of additional artefacts between the CXR's of COVID-19 infected patients from those of the patients exhibiting viral and Bacterial infection. These observations, if further confirmed, maybe useful in providing the clinician with convincing evidences of the LBP-Gabor scheme predicted decision by complementing our interface software with a visual display of some of the created sub-images.",
