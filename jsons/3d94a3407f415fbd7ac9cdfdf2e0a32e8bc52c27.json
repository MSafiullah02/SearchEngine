New cases and deaths were defined as laboratory-confirmed positive cases or deaths which were reported by a state's public health authority for the data consistency and better data-quality. 3 Each of these state authorities reported its data in different format, while most, if not all, of them followed the reporting guidelines of the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC). It is noteworthy that on April 14, 2020, the CDC updated its definition of positive cases and included probable-positive cases. 4 The impact of this change to the data released on April 20, 2020 would be minimal due to a short time-interval (many states have not adopted the criteria yet) and the confirmatory laboratory-test result. Therefore, the case/death numbers reported here might be smaller than those reported by others. For quality control of the released and curated data, the COVID-19 Tracking Project employed a 4-tier score system, which included 4 simple components, including reporting positive test results reliably, reporting negatives sometimes, for reporting negatives reliably and reporting all commercial tests. Based on the sum of these scores, each state corresponded to a letter grade A, B, C and D, with A for the best quality. All states scored A or B.",
