Thus far, one clear lesson of the current pandemic is that changing behavior\u2014sheltering at home and social distancing\u2014can quickly wield extraordinary power. Frequent hand washing, infrequent grocery shopping, and public mask wearing have become go-to practices for many people. In the Washington where we live, these rapidly adopted new behaviors and a stay-at-home order issued early on helped reduce COVID-19 cases and deaths by mid April.",

Nearly half of all American adults suffer from two or more chronic health conditions, including high blood pressure, obesity, and Type 2 diabetes (CDC 2020). And in the context of COVID-19, we know that people with chronic disease(s) suffer more severe symptoms and have a higher death rate. This unsettling reality illustrates the value of practices that underpin good health. For during a pandemic, who wouldn\u2019t want their physical and mental health to be as fully functional and robust as possible?",

When a person includes an abundance of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables in their diet it spurs certain gut-dwelling microbiota (or a person\u2019s own cells) to make an array of chemical compounds, many of which help prevent the onset of chronic diseases (Montgomery and Bikl\u00e9 2016). It\u2019s like having an inner pharmacist to imbue one\u2019s immune, nervous, and circulatory systems with preventative medicine. While pharmaceutical products play an important role in treating chronic diseases, a better course of action is to greatly reduce the need for people to rely on them in the first place.",

To support regenerative practices we\u2019ll need new products like no-till planters and cover-crop rollers in a range of sizes to handle more types of crops on farms of all sizes, as well as microbial inoculants to accelerate the biological recovery of the soil microbiome. Deploying mutually supportive practices and products gives us the best chance of solving the intertwined problems around soil health, environmental quality, and human health.",
