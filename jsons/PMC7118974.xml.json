It is helpful to elicit as much information as possible about type of accommodation expected, mode of travel between destinations, and anticipated activities. Many sources of pretravel advice are available (Table 1\n) [1], [2], [3]. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) make their recommendations available in print or on line (www.cdc.gov/travel) [4]. Adoptive families may also receive information from agencies, travel agents, airlines, and embassies; it is prudent for families to verify any information about possible outbreaks or other local situations with reliable and authoritative sources such as the CDC or World Health Organization (WHO). For example, a measles outbreak in a Chinese orphanage led the CDC to suspend adoptions from the affected orphanage temporarily [5]. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, the CDC provided up-to-date information and released travel advisories that were instrumental in informing families and adoption agencies about the status of the epidemic. Although the SARS outbreak resulted in suspension of adoptions from several countries, disruption of plans of many adoptive families, and household isolation of some newly adopted children, no cases were reported in internationally adopted children.",

Hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for almost all individuals traveling to arrange adoptions or pick up children outside the United States, because the risk of hepatitis A is intermediate to high in most countries from which children are adopted [4]. Hepatitis A vaccine is highly effective, and a two-dose schedule offers long-term protection [10]. Adults who need protection against hepatitis A and B may receive the combination vaccine Twinrix (Hepatitis A Inactivated and Hepatitis B [Recombinant] vaccine; Glaxo SmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) [11], [12]. Typhoid vaccine should be considered for travel to many of these countries, because this disease is also contracted by exposure to contaminated food and water [4]. Protection afforded by typhoid vaccines is incomplete, however, and all travelers to countries where a risk of contracting diseases associated with contaminated food and water is present should be counseled about appropriate dietary precautions. These include drinking only boiled or safe drinking water (chlorinated water, bottled water from a reliable source, or carbonated water), eating only cooked or freshly peeled fruits and vegetables, and avoiding raw or undercooked meat and seafood [13].",

All travelers can benefit from information about dietary precautions, oral rehydration, general safety precautions, sun protection, jet lag, motion sickness, animal hazards, swimming hazards, road safety, seat belt and car seat use, and what medical supplies to bring with them. Traveling to receive a child puts additional burdens on travelers, especially those becoming parents for the first time, who may never have traveled long distances with a small child. When siblings travel, attention must be paid to their needs as well as to those of the new adoptee. Bringing along another adult to care for siblings is often helpful, especially if only one parent is traveling [22]. Many sources of detailed travel advice for children are available [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28].",

When there are mild or moderate symptoms and one to two loose stools per day without blood in the stool, an antimotility agent can be added. When distressing symptoms or more frequent stools are present, an antibacterial agent can be added to the regimen. Antibacterial agents shown to be effective in traveler's diarrhea include the fluoroquinolones, although resistance rates are increasing in some areas and antibiotic-associated diarrhea is a potential side effect of concern. Azithromycin and rifaximin are also effective treatments for traveler's diarrhea [31], [32], [33].

Antimotility agents are not recommended for infants or children less than 6 years of age and should be used judiciously in older children [23]. Instead, oral rehydration is the mainstay of therapy for mild to moderate symptoms. Antibacterial agents that can be used for children are limited by resistance rates to common antibacterial agents and lack of approval of fluoroquinolones in children. At this time, azithromycin is the drug of choice for treatment of most traveler's diarrhea in children, and a dose of 10/mg/kg/d for up to 3\u20135 days is a reasonable option, although no studies have been done to ascertain the optimal dose or length of therapy. Parents should monitor the child's condition carefully. If high fever, blood in the stool, persistent symptoms, or worsening dehydration occurs, families should seek immediate medical attention. Parents should also be aware that diarrhea in the adopted child may represent infections or conditions other than acute traveler's diarrhea, such as chronic diarrhea related to parasitic infections or malabsorption syndromes. Medical care should be sought for acutely ill children in the country where the adoption is occurring. Additional evaluation for causes of chronic diarrhea can be undertaken during the child's initial medical assessment in the United States.",
