Until recently, coronavirus genetic analysis has been limited to analysis of temperature-sensitive (ts) mutants Baric 1992, 1994; Lai and Cavanagh 1997; Schaad and Baric 1994; Stalcup et al. 1998) , defective interfering (DI) RNAs Narayanan and Makino 2001; Repass and Makino 1998; Williams et al. 1999) , and recombinant viruses generated by targeted recombination (Fischer et al. 1997; Hsue and Masters 1999; Kuo et al. 2000) . Among these, targeted recombination is the seminal approach developed to systematically assess the function of individual mutations in the 3 0 -most~10 kb of the MHV genome. Methods to assemble an MHV full-length infectious construct have been hampered by the large size of the genome, the regions of chromosomal instability, and the inability to synthesize full-length transcripts (Almaz\u00b5n et al. 2000; Masters 1999; Yount et al. 2000) . This is especially problematic within the group 2 coronavirus replicase, where several regions of chromosomal toxicity and instability have hampered the development of infectious cDNAs. Full-length infectious constructs will allow for the systematic dissection of the structure and function of each viral gene, the phenotypic consequences of gene rearrangement on virus replication and pathogenesis, the development of coronavirus heterologous gene expression systems, and a clearer understanding of the transcription and replication strategy of the Coronaviridae.

Like many other positive-sense RNA viruses, the coronavirus replicase is translated as a large precursor polyprotein that is processed by viral proteinases, giving rise to~15 replicase proteins. The functions of most of the coronavirus replicase proteins are unknown. However, based on nucleotide sequence homology and empirical studies, identifiable functions include two papainlike cysteine proteases, a chymotrypsin-like 3C protease, a cysteinerich growth factor-related protein, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a nucleoside triphosphate (NTP)-binding/helicase domain, and a zincfinger nucleic acid-binding domain (Enjuanes et al. 2000a; Penzes et al. 2001; Siddell 1995) .

The enzyme Esp3I recognizes an asymmetrical site and cleaves external to the recognition sequence, allowing for traditional and \"no-see-um\" cloning applications (Fig. 2 , Table 1 ). With traditional approaches, Esp3I sites can be oriented to reform the recognition site after ligation of two MHV cDNAs, leaving the restriction site within the genomes of recombinant viruses. However, the Esp3I recognition site is asymmetrical, so a simple reverse orientation allows for the insertion of an Esp3I recognition sequence on the ends of two adjacent clones with the cleavage site derived from virtually any 4-nucleotide sequence combination dictated by the virus sequence. On cleavage and ligation with the adjoining fragment, the Esp3I sites are lost from the final ligation products, leaving a Fig. 1 . Strategy for the systematic assembly of TGEV full-length cDNA.

The traditional approach to the use of Esp3I involves the ligation of two fragments containing identical Esp3I restriction sites, resulting in a ligation product with an intact Esp3I site remaining.

The use of the \"no-see-um\" technology allows for the assembly of large DNAs from smaller subclones without the incorporation of unique restriction sites into the genome. cloned and wild-type virus. We then isolated seven consensus cDNAs that spanned the entire length of the MHV-A59 genome in the same manner as the TGEV infectious construct (Fig. 3) . This was necessary because the MHV-A59 genome contains several major regions of sequence toxicity in microbial cloning vectors, most of which map be-tween~10 and 15 kb in the MHV ORF 1a/ORF 1b polyprotein and an unstable region mapping~5.0 kb in ORF 1a. As described for the TGEV B fragment, cDNAs were isolated after intersecting the toxic domains and separating them into independent subclones. However, many subclones were still unstable in traditional PUC-based cloning vectors (e.g., pGem, TopoII) even when maintained at low temperature. Consequently, we used pSMART cloning vectors (Lucigen), which lack a promoter and indicator gene and contain transcriptional and translational terminators surrounding the cloning site. Instability appears to be associated with expression, as this entire domain (nucleotides 9,555-15,754) is also stable in yeast vectors (pYES2.1 Topo TA Cloning Kit from Invitrogen) that maintain tight regulation over foreign gene expression (Yount et al., unpublished results) .

At this time, we do not know the minimal number of 3 0 poly(A) residues necessary for transcript infectivity or whether a 5 0 methylated cap is essential. Electroporation of the genomic-length RNAs resulted in the production of recombinant MHV virus with growth characteristics identical to those of the wild-type viruses (Yount et al. 2000 . Importantly, the molecularly cloned viruses contained marker mutations engineered into the component clones. Inclusion of nuclocapsid(N)-encoding transcripts enhanced the infectivity of full-length MHV and TGEV transcripts. In MHV, N transcripts enhanced the infectivity of full-length MHV-A59 transcripts by 10-to 15-fold as evidenced by increased viral antigen expression and virus titers at 25 h postinfection . It is unclear whether MHV N transcripts, N protein, or both are essential for increased virus yields after electroporation, or whether this effect would be observed with transcripts encoding unrelated genes. Coronaviruses have been demonstrated to package low concentrations of subgenomic mRNAs, especially N transcripts, and several studies have suggested that N may function in transcription and replication and are tightly associated with the replication complex. With IBV, but not TGEV or HCoV-229E, N transcripts are absolutely essential for full-length transcript infectivity (Casais et al. 2001) .

However, it is possible that such variants might arise after RNA transfection, as a consequence of high-frequency MHV RNA recombination between incomplete and genome-length transcripts. It is likely that such variants would be replication impaired and rapidly out-competed by wild-type virus. A second limitation is that the yield of full-length cDNA product is reduced, resulting in less robust transfection efficiencies compared with the more traditional systematic assembly method. At this time, the MHV approach suffers from the large number of component clones (seven), which increase the complexity of the system and reduce the yield of full-length cDNA product after in vitro ligation.

Rather, it allows for rapid genetic manipulation of independent subclones, which minimizes the introduction of spurious mutations elsewhere in the genome during recombinant DNA manipulation. Theoretical limits of our method may exceed several million base pairs of DNA and will likely surmount the cloning capacity of bacterial (BAC) and eukaryotic artificial chromosome vectors (Grimes and Cooke 1998) .

Viral genomes that are unstable in prokaryotic vectors can also be cloned by these methods (Boyer and Haenni 1994; Rice et al. 1989) .

Using this strategy, it may be possible to reconstruct a minimal microbial genome from the bottom up. However, problems associated with isolating large DNA fragments and the introduction of large DNA genomes into environments that permit replication will likely be significant hurdles.

Seamless insertion of foreign genes into the coronavirus genome can be accomplished with Class IIS restriction enzymes. In this case, a target gene is systematically removed and replaced by a new gene (new insert). Using a primer with overlaps a unique upstream (Site A) restriction site, the upstream arm amplicon is tions (ORF 3a and 3b) that may be deleted from the viral genome without impacting infectivity (Curtis et al. 2002; Laude et al. 1990; McGoldrick et al. 1999; Wesley et al. 1991) . We have developed a rapid approach that allows seamless insertion of foreign sequences into virtually any nucleotide position in the MHV genome, based on class IIS restriction endonucleases (Fig. 4) . In this approach, flanking sequences around the target domain are amplified as separate arms linked by unique class IIS restriction site oriented as described in Fig. 3 . A third amplicon encoding the payload sequence of interest is isolated and flanked by similar class IIS sites. After restriction digestion and ligation, the foreign sequences are inserted into the backbone sequence at any given nucleotide, leaving no evidence of the restriction sites that were used to \"sew\" the new sequences into the MHV backbone.

In the case with TGEV, GFP expression was stable for at least 10 passages.

MHV has long been used as a premiere model to study coronavirus assembly and release, replication, transcription, entry, and pathogenesis. The availability of MHV and SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clones will complement the existing targeted recombination approaches by providing a tool for the mutagenesis of the replicase gene, which encode a large number of cleavage products that have not been fully characterized. The structure and function of the~20-kb MHV replicase domain will likely remain a fertile area of research for the next decade and reveal novel protein functions that participate and regulate discontinuous transcription and high-frequency RNA recombination. Although large panels of reagents are available for analyzing replicase protein expression, processing, and subcellular localization, a spectrum of genetically informative mutations have not been systematically targeted to any of these replicase proteins. Given the complexity and size of the coronavirus replicase gene, the number of potential mutants that can be generated is enormous and will likely require bioinformatic approaches for building and testing specific hypotheses. For example, the ORF1a C-terminal MHV p15 protein is highly conserved among group I through III coronaviruses and contains a large number of conserved cysteine residues and predicted phosphorylation, myristylation, and glycosylation sites (prosite, unpublished) (Fig. 7) . The original sequence report of p15 also suggested possible similarities to growth factor-like proteins (Lee et al. 1991) . Recent studies with an IBV homolog suggest that p15 exists as a dimer and accumulates on stimulation with epidermal growth factor, providing some evidence that the protein might be involved in the growth factor signaling pathway (Ng and Liu 2002) . A single amino acid mutation has been identified in p15 of the temperature sensitive mutant, LA6, an MHV-A59 mutant with a defect in RNA synthesis at nonpermissive temperature .
