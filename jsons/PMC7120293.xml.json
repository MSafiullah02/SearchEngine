Primarily, it refers simply to inflammation of the walls of vessels of any size in the lower respiratory tract. The term is, however, also used for the systemic vasculitis syndromes that commonly or predominantly present with involvement of the respiratory tract, such as the vasculitis syndromes associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). Pulmonary vasculitis is usually associated with a systemic disorder caused by a variety of immunologic mechanisms. In the context of a vasculitis syndrome, the lungs and lower airways can be affected by three major pathologic processes: (1) inflammatory cell infiltration and necrosis of the pulmonary parenchyma; (2) inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree often leading to stenoses; and (3) pulmonary capillaritis causing diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Beyond capillaritis, inflammation of vessels of different sizes in the lung, including pulmonary arteries, veins, and bronchial arteries, are comparably rare manifestations of some unique vasculitis syndromes. Clinicians should also remember that not all respiratory symptoms occurring in patients with vasculitis are caused by inflammation of pulmonary vessels or the underlying vasculitis syndrome, infection being the most important alternative diagnosis. This chapter reviews the pulmonary manifestations of the various vasculitis syndromes using the recently revised Chapel Hill Consensus definitions and nomenclature [1].",

            "text": "MPA is defined as necrotizing vasculitis with few or no immune deposits, affecting small vessels including capillaries, venules, or arterioles (polyangiitis). Necrotizing arteritis involving small- and medium-sized arteries may be present. Necrotizing glomerulonephritis is very common; pulmonary capillaritis resulting in alveolar hemorrhage occurs frequently [1]. GPA is characterized by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation involving the respiratory tract and necrotizing vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized vessels. The most commonly affected vessels are capillaries, venules, arterioles, and arteries, but the wall of the aorta can also be affected by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation [1]. For these reasons the term \u201cpolyangiitis\u201d is used for these syndromes [1]. It is the necrotizing granulomatous inflammation that sets GPA apart from MPA. The diagnosis of GPA depends on the presence of clinical, pathologic, or radiographic evidence or surrogates of granulomatous inflammation. The vasculitis of MPA is indistinguishable from that of GPA, and there may be substantial overlap between the syndromes. For these reasons, the therapeutic approach to patients with GPA and MPA is governed by the same principles, and most clinical studies and therapeutic trials have combined both diseases. ",

Focal vasculitis, thrombosis, and fibrous obliteration of vascular lumina may be seen in areas affected by this type of inflammation which affects predominantly the upper respiratory tract and lungs, but may involve any organ. Atypical and rare histopathologic features of GPA include organizing pneumonia, bronchocentric inflammation, and occasionally a marked number of eosinophils in the inflammatory infiltrates [3].

Lung nodules or mass lesions which may or may not cavitate, can be singular, but are usually multiple and bilateral. They can range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. Alveolar infiltrates should prompt consideration of DAH even in the absence of hemoptysis (see discussion later in this chapter). Unusual manifestations include lymphadenopathy, lobar consolidation, and large pleural effusions. Tracheobronchial lesions are common, may be asymptomatic, and only detectable by bronchoscopy. When airway stenoses occur, symptoms that can be mistaken for asthma include stridor or localized wheezes. Pulmonary function testing including inspiratory and expiratory flow-volume loops may provide important clues to the presence of airway narrowing. Bronchoscopic inspection of the tracheobronchial tree is recommended for patients with unexplained respiratory symptoms, abnormalities on pulmonary function test results, or radiographic abnormalities [5, 12].",

MTX and AZA are equivalent for remission maintenance, whereas another randomized controlled trial showed that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is not as effective as AZA for remission maintenance [19]. Thus, the use of MMF for remission maintenance can only be supported for patients who have failed MTX and AZA, or who have contraindications for both agents. The Wegener\u2019s Granulomatosis Etanercept trial (WGET), in which MTX was used for remission maintenance, confirmed that long-term remission remains an elusive goal for many patients, as remission was maintained in less than half of the patients [20]. The RTX in ANCA-associated Vasculitis (RAVE) trial showed that a single 4-week infusion series of RTX was as effective as 18 months of conventional cytotoxic therapy with CYC followed by AZA, even though patients in the RTX treatment arm of that trial received no further therapy following the original infusion therapy [17]. Several recent studies including the RAVE trial have shown that PR3-ANCA (versus MPO-ANCA), the diagnosis of GPA (versus MPA), and relapsing disease (versus new diagnosis) represent risk factors for subsequent relapses even when patients are maintained on AZA for maintenance therapy [17, 21, 22].",

Subglottic stenosis is often addressed with dilation procedures paired with local injection of long-acting glucocorticoids with or without mitomycin C [23]. Stenosis of the large airways may require bronchoscopic interventions, including dilation by rigid bronchoscope, YAG-laser treatment, and the placement of silicone airway stents, or balloon dilations which can be performed with the flexible bronchoscope [5]. Tracheobronchial infections, like nose or sinus infections, are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease by promoting relapses. For this reason, it is advisable to provide antimicrobial therapy based on culture and susceptibility results from bronchial washings. The application of topical glucocorticoids may spare patients with tracheobronchial involvement from ongoing oral glucocorticoid therapy. Lastly, pneumocystis jerovecii pneumonia is a well recognized and potentially fatal complication of immunosuppressive therapy for GPA that can easily be prevented [24]. Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis is recommended for all patients with GPA receiving any kind of immunosuppression including being B-cell depleted after RTX therapy [25].",

EGPA is included among the ANCA-associated vasculitides, but only 40\u201370 % of patients with active EGPA have detectable ANCA prior to treatment. If ANCA is detectable it is usually of the P-ANCA/MPO-ANCA type [26, 27]. EGPA is primarily distinguished from GPA and MPA by a high prevalence of asthma and peripheral blood and tissue eosinophilia. Three distinct disease phases which may not always follow in sequence have been described for the disease [28]. A prodromal allergic phase with asthma may last for a number of years. The eosinophilic phase with prominent peripheral and tissue eosinophilia may also last a number of years, and the manifestations may remit and recur over this time period. The differential diagnosis for patients in this phase of the disease includes parasitic infection and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. The vasculitic phase consisting of systemic vasculitis may be life-threatening. This is usually the last phase and may be masked or prevented by glucocorticoid therapy used for the management of earlier phases. Asthma usually predates the vasculitic phase by a mean of 7 years (range 0\u201361). \u201cFormes frustes\u201d of EGPA have also been described with eosinophilic vasculitis and/or eosinophilic granulomas in isolated organs without evidence of systemic disease [29].",

Even though this trial showed significantly better patient and renal survival at 6 months, there was no long-term advantage of PLEX and there were too few patients with DAH to allow a subset analysis. Only one single-center cohort study focusing on MPA with DAH in 20 patients admitted to an intensive care unit described 100 % survival of these patients when PLEX was added to standard immunosuppressive therapy [50]. The role of PLEX in severe AAV is currently undergoing further investigation.

This epitope is only accessible for autoantibodies in the basement membranes of kidneys and lungs. DAH occurs in about half of patients with anti-GBM disease and requires an additional inhalational injury, particularly smoking, to render the antigen accessible for the autoantibodies and for the development of the pulmonary disease manifestation. Anti-GBM disease rarely causes isolated alveolar hemorrhage in the absence of renal disease. Even though patients usually have serum anti-GBM autoantibodies, the diagnosis of anti-GBM disease cannot be established without histopathologic documentation of linear immunoglobulin G deposits along the basement membranes in lung or kidney. Whether anti-GBM disease represents a true vasculitis is a matter of definition. As the glomerulus is a capillary structure, its inflammation by definition represents a form of capillaritis. This is the main reason for the inclusion of anti-GBM disease in the nomenclature and definitions of the Chapel Hill classification. Yet, the prominent histopathologic finding in the lung of patients with anti-GBM disease is the \u201cbland histopathology,\u201d whereas capillaritis represents a secondary histopathologic feature that has also been described in some patients [52]. Early implementation of immunosuppressive therapy in conjunction with PLEX is the key to a favorable outcome in patients with anti-GBM disease [53].

The onset of DAH in patients with SLE is usually abrupt, but hardly ever the first sign of the disease. The disease presentation is usually rapidly progressive with pulmonary infiltrates and fever, mimicking infection, and hemoptysis may be absent. Consequently, the differentiation of DAH from infection in SLE usually requires a diagnostic BAL. Mechanical ventilation, infection, and CYC therapy were reported as negative prognostic factors in one report. The reported mortality of DAH in SLE varies between 0 and 90 % [54\u201356]. Treatment consists of glucocorticoids and CYC. The use of PLEX has been suggested, but its benefit remains unproven.",

As DAH can also occur in the context of adult respiratory distress syndrome, and hemoptysis is absent in over half of the reported patients with APS and DAH, BAL should be performed early to establish the diagnosis. Tissue necrosis from microthrombosis as well as pulmonary capillaritis has been implicated as causes of DAH in APS. The capillaritis of APS is immune-complex mediated. The coexistence of thrombosis and capillaritis with DAH represents a therapeutic dilemma, as anticoagulation may need to be interrupted to control the hemorrhage, and patients often require placement of an inferior vena cava filter. The largest single-center report comprising 17 patients and review of 24 cases published in the literature indicates a high mortality of about 40 % despite aggressive immunosuppressive therapy [57]. Glucocorticoid therapy alone is usually ineffective, as is monotherapy with agents like AZA or MMF. PLEX in addition to immunosuppressive therapy is often considered, but its efficacy remains questionable in patients with APS and DAH. Best results were obtained with cyclophosphamide or RTX, sometimes in combination.",

This lingered until he experienced significant worsening of sinusitis symptoms 3 months later. At that time he also developed epistaxis prompting an evaluation by an allergist. A couple of weeks later he developed acute left-sided hearing loss, night sweats, and migratory large joint arthralgias. By this time he had already lost 10 lb of weight due to malaise and lack of appetite. Four months after the onset of first symptoms he was hospitalized at a local rural hospital, where he was found to have dry cough, bilateral episcleritis, lower extremity palpable purpura, and nodular lesions on chest roentgenogram. A rheumatology evaluation at the local hospital led to testing for ANCA, and a nasal biopsy was obtained. Renal function and urinary sediment were normal. The ANCA test was positive for C-ANCA and PR3-ANCA, and the nasal biopsy reportedly showed \u201cgranulomas.\u201d The patient was treated for 3 days with intravenous methyl-prednisolone and dismissed on oral prednisone 40 mg twice daily to be tapered to 30 mg daily over the course of the next 3 weeks. He was scheduled for initiation of RTX infusions 375 mg/m2 as an outpatient. Scheduling difficulties led to a delay in initiation of the infusions.

Physical examination of eyes, ears, nose, heart, and lungs was unremarkable. Hemoglobin was 11.0 g/dL, white blood count 23.3 \u00d7 109/L, platelet count 405 \u00d7 109/L, and lymphocyte and CD4 count are normal. An electrolyte panel and urinalysis and microscopy were normal. The patient\u2019s only medications consisted of prednisone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis. The patient was dismissed from the emergency room for further outpatient evaluation by rheumatology the next day. A CT scan of the chest is obtained (Fig. 10.1b) and after consultation with a pulmonologist a bronchoscopy with BAL is performed. This shows progressively bloody return indicative of alveolar hemorrhage. Over the next several hours the patient\u2019s respiratory status worsens, hemoglobin drops to 8.8 g/dL, and patient is admitted to the medical intensive care unit and requires mechanical ventilation. His course is complicated by the development of bilateral pneumothoraces requiring bilateral chest tube placement. Methyl-prednisolone is given at a dose of 1 g/day for 3 days, and one dose of RTX, 375 mg/m2, is given, followed 48 h later by eight daily sessions of PLEX. Ten days after admission to the intensive care unit he is transferred to the general ward where the second chest tube is removed (Fig. 10.1c). Following completion of PLEX, he receives completion of the RTX course (the remaining three once weekly doses). Following recovery he completes the taper of the prednisone dose to complete discontinuation before month 6. He has not relapsed over the course of the last 3 years. However, he has been retreated once with RTX without glucocorticoids following reconstitution of B-cells and recurrence of PR3-ANCA positivity.\n\n",

            "text": "This case offers the following teaching and discussion points:The development of symptoms and disease manifestations is quite typical in this patient. Despite this, the diagnosis of GPA is often delayed.Glucocorticoids alone can only temporize and do not control this systemic disease process very well at doses below 60 mg daily without prompt implementation of definitive therapy.Even though the combination of ENT disease with pulmonary nodules could be interpreted as \u201cnon-severe\u201d disease allowing the choice of MTX in combination with glucocorticoids as first remission induction regimen, the severe constitutional symptoms (night sweats and weight loss) and the presence of palpable purpura suggest a rapidly progressive disease process with developing features of capillaritis. The provided information does not allow the distinction between conductive or sensorineural hearing loss, and we don\u2019t know whether the eye inflammation was merely episcleritis or early scleritis. Sensorineural hearing loss and scleritis are clearly severe disease manifestations. The classification as severe disease for treatment purposes made at the outside hospital is certainly appropriate. For a newly diagnosed patient with severe GPA, cyclophosphamide or RTX is equally effective. However, in this young man who wanted to preserve his fertility, RTX is the preferred choice for that reason.Without prompt implementation of definitive therapy, the disease progresses, and in this case DAH developed.DAH presents without hemoptysis in a large proportion of patients, and the absence of hemoptysis should not dissuade from suspecting it, particularly in a patient with preexisting diagnosis of GPA. Infection is the alternative explanation for the chest roentgenographic changes at the time of presentation to the emergency room.DAH of any degree of severity should be considered as potentially life-threatening, and patients should be closely monitored until a definitive diagnosis is established, definitive therapy has been initiated, and control of disease activity has been ascertained.Bronchoscopy with BAL for the evaluation of suspected DAH should be conducted in a safe setting, where worsening of the respiratory status that can be associated with the procedure can be treated with the necessary supportive measures.Once disease activity is controlled and the pulmonary bleeding stops, alveolar hemorrhagic infiltrates clear fast, unless diffuse alveolar damage with ARDS develops.Survivors of DAH usually experience complete recovery of lung function.The role of PLEX in this patient\u2019s course remains unclear. There is currently no data from a randomized controlled trial that applies to patients with DAH caused by ANCA-associated vasculitis.\n",
