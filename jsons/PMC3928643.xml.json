            "text": "TH1 has been suggested to be the dominant and protective immune response against malaria both in rodents and humans [1,2]. Yet the blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum can serve to immunosuppress the host\u2019s immune response to the liver stage of the parasite [3] Dendritic cell maturation is inhibited by P. falciparum-infected red blood cells (RBCs) [4]; monocyte maturation is also suppressed by malaria pigments (haemozoin), and low serum IL-12 was reported in severe malaria [5,6]. These observations suggest that the IL-12-driven TH1, IFN\u03b3-dominant response patterns seen following P. falciparum infection may not be functioning optimally; thus, against this background data, one may ask how the infected host is capable of mounting an effective TH1 response against the blood-borne stage of this parasite? An alternative pathway may be needed to achieve this host immune response.",

            "text": "To gain a better understanding of host immune response patterns associated with P. falciparum infection in humans, this study carried out transcriptional profiling using microarray analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after P. falciparum infection. The earlier analysis showed an up-regulation of gene expression for toll-like receptor signalling, NF-\u03baB, TNF, IFN-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, p38 MAPK, MHC class I and II molecules [7]. This study further analysed the data focusing on the specific type or types of host immune response induced by infection. Results indicated an up-regulation of TGF-\u03b2 and the IL-6 family gene (oncostatin M), both of which induce TH17 immune response. This study also observed an elevation in the expression of interferon gamma, NK cell cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC), which are triggered by interferon alpha/beta (TH\u03b1\u03b2), instead of IL-12 (TH1). These results suggest multiple immune pathways may be activated following infection with P. falciparum. For the purpose of this study have classified these additional pathways as: TH\u03b1\u03b2 and TH17 immune response. The TH\u03b1\u03b2 pathway is not generally recognized within the immunology community as a distinct T cell maturation pathway while the TH17 response pattern has only recently been recognized [8]. However, TH\u03b1\u03b2 responses in which \u03b1 and \u03b2 interferons drive a succession of cellular process leading to mid-moderate IFN-\u03b3 production and NK cell and ADCC activation have been described in the host response to viruses but they have not been shown to play an important role in the maturation of the anti-malaria adaptive immune response.",

Macrophage activation is characteristic of traditional TH1 immune response, while NK activation (natural cytotoxicity and ADCC) is more characteristic of TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response. In addition, TH17 immune response is typical immunological pathway against extracellular bacteria and fungi. Pathogens may induce ineffective host immune response for immune evasion.

            "text": "Although macrophage/monocyte activation is traditionally considered to be a strong marker for classic TH1 type immune response, this study surprisingly found that express levels of most macrophage activation genes were relatively unchanged or slightly suppressed after P. falciparum infection (Table 2). These data support the hypothesis that there may be two pathways involved in the induction of TH1 types of immune responses: a TH\u03b1\u03b2 interferon driven path and IL-12 driven path (see Discussion). Most macrophage activation and proliferation-related genes were unchanged (Table 2). IL-12 is clearly the major cytokine needed to initiate a strong classic TH1 type immune response, and IL-12 expression levels remain unchanged over the course of this study (Table 2). This observation suggests that the induction of a TH1-type anti-malarial immune response may be driven by cytokines other than IL-12. Like IL-12, other traditional TH1 cytokine: IL-3, M-CSF, and GM-CSF can also cause macrophage proliferation but these genes are also not up-regulated in response to infection with P. falciparum (Table 2). In contrast, many macrophage inhibition-related genes were up-regulated after malaria, including haem oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), JunB, and IRF1. JunB, PU.1 and IRF1 suppress macrophage proliferation. As indicated above, a macrophage differentiation inducer, MafB, is up-regulated after malaria. Its antagonists, JunB and PU.1, were also up-regulated, so the effect of MafB could be suppressed. PU.1 up-regulation can drive monocytes to differentiate into dendritic cells instead of macrophages. Although macrophages can also express Fc receptor genes, this study thinks these Fc receptor expression after malaria should mainly occur in NK cells. The Fc receptor signalling pathway (ADCC signalling pathway) in NK cell was all up-regulated (Table 1). Also, DAP12 up-regulation can suppress Fc receptor signalling in macrophages, so it is less likely that these up-regulated Fc receptors belong to macrophages. Although IL-10 itself was not up-regulated, many IL-10 downstream genes were up-regulated as shown in Figure 1 of the previous analysis results [7]. IL-10 can activate NK cells and de-activate macrophages. HMOX1 is the major downstream effector molecule to mediate IL-10 inhibition of macrophages. HMOX1 was up-regulated after malaria. HMOX1 generates CO molecule to mediate anti-inflammatory effects in macrophages, which is opposite to nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS), which generates NO molecule to cause inflammatory effects. Argininesuccinate synthetase (ASS) is the rate-limiting enzyme to synthesize arginine, the substrate of iNOS. iNOS is the central mediator representing macrophage classical activation, and unchanged ASS and iNOS express levels support the notion that macrophages are not being activated after malaria infection. In the study, macrophages were inhibited rather than activated after malaria. In summary, many elements of TH1 immune response were up-regulated following infection with P. falciparum, including: interferon alpha/beta inducible genes, interferon gamma inducible genes, NK cell-related genes (NK cell cytotoxicity), ADCC-related genes, TH1 chemokines, and CD8 T cell-related genes. However, macrophages appear to become de-activated and do not appear to proliferate after malarial infection.",

These observations suggested STAT1 up-regulated Fc receptors. There is negative correlation between STAT1 and STAT4. Although some previous studies found that STAT4, IL-12R, and Fc receptors are co-expressed, STAT4 is not correlated or even negatively correlated with these up-regulated Fc receptors in malarial infection. Fc receptors suppressed STAT4 expression or STAT4 suppressed Fc receptors (Table 5). Rank correlation has also been done, but there were no significant results.

This study selected IL-4, IL-12, TGFB1/IL-6, IL-17, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 as the central gene markers to explore possible networking among the 2,894 genes under analysis in this study. This study was able to identify only a few up-regulated genes in this cluster that centred on IL-4 (Figure 3) or IL-12 (Figure 4). In contrast, gene networks centred on TGFB1/IL6, IL-17 (Figure 5), or IFN-\u03b1\u03b2 (Figure 3) were more dramatically altered during the malaria disease cycle. These results further support a model for malaria immune response in which IL-17/IFN-alpha/beta plays a more central regulatory role than IL-4 and IL-12. Figure 6 shows a sketch of the major pathways of host immune response that are felt to play a role in recovery from malaria based on the observations made in this study, as well as those made by other investigators in previous research. The changes in their expression levels during the early, acute and recovery stages of P. falciparum infection are summarized in Figure 1. As shown in Figures 1, 7, 8 and 9, the expression of genes related to TH2 immune response were unchanged following malaria infection, with most changes occurring in genes related to the TH17 and TH\u03b1\u03b2 driven pathway of anti-malaria immune response.",

            "text": "Host immune response can be categorized into TH1, TH2, and TH17 immune response pathways. TH1 immune responses (Type 1 immune response) are IFN-\u03b3 and IgG-mediated and they play an important role in host responses to viruses and intracellular bacteria/protozoa. TH2 immune responses are IL-4 and IgE-mediated immune response are important to host responses to helminths; TH17, initiated by TGF-\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-17 are important in host responses to extracellular bacterial pathogens [9-11]. In this research, these data suggest that there should be a new immunological pathway derived from the original TH1 immune response: TH\u03b1\u03b2. TH\u03b1\u03b2 is named after IFN\u03b1/\u03b2. In this model, TH\u03b1\u03b2 is triggered by interferon alpha/beta + IL-10 and TH1 is triggered by interleukin 12. Based on previous work by others, TH\u03b1\u03b2 is important in host immune response against virus infection; TH1 is important in host immune response against intracellular bacteria/protozoa. Different types of host immune response have different effector cells. In TH2 immune response, the effector cells are mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, IgE/IgG4 secreting B cells, and IL-4 secreting CD4 T cells. In TH17 immune response, the effector cells are neutrophils, IgA/IgM/IgG2 secreting B cells, and IL-17 secreting CD4 T cells. In TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response, the effector cells are NK cells, IgG1 secreting B cells, CTL, and IL-10 (+++)/IFN-\u03b3(+) secreting CD4 T cells. In TH1 immune response, the effector cells are macrophages, IgG3 secreting B cells, CTL, and IFN-\u03b3(+++) secreting CD4 T cells. Similarly different types of host immune response use different STAT proteins to initiate specific immune reactions. IL-4 activates STAT6 in TH2 immune response. TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 activates STAT3\u03b2 in TH17 immune response. Interferon alpha/beta and IL-10 activates STAT1 and STAT3\u03b1 in TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response. IL-12 activates STAT4 in TH1 immune response [12]. TGF-\u03b2 and IL-2 activate STAT5 in regulatory T cell (Treg) immune response. Based on these data, malaria infection appears to induce a mixed TH17 and TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response which best fits with a model in which both pathways are activated during the onset and recovery from malaria infection.",

            "text": "Others have shown that TGF-\u03b2 with IL-6 can induce TH17 immune response [10,11]. TH17 lymphocytes also produce large amounts of IL-8, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1, which recruit and activate neutrophils. Due to\u2019 previous analysis, toll-like receptor 1, 2, 4, 7, 8 are up-regulated after malarial infection. TLR1/2/4 mainly induce anti-extracellular bacteria TH17 immune response. TLR7/8 binding to single strand RNA mainly induce anti-virus TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response. In addition, this study found a lot of heat shock proteins are up-regulated after malarial infection. Heat shock proteins, mainly HSP60 or HSP70, can activate TLR2/4 for inducing TH17 immune response. In this study, TGF-\u03b2, IL-1, and IL-8 were strongly up-regulated in acute malaria (Table 3). Although IL-17 was not up-regulated, the IL-6-related cytokine family gene oncostatin M, was up-regulated in acute malaria infection. oncostatin M can up-regulate STAT3\u03b2, a key mediator in TH17 immune response [13]. Thus, it appears that TH17 immune response can be induced in malaria infection. Up-regulated TGF-\u03b2, IL-6, or TNF are associated with a higher frequency of malaria complications and an overall poor malaria prognosis. A previous study revealed that neutrophil-related genes were up-regulated in children after acute P. falciparum malaria infection [14]. They also reported up-regulation of IL-6 receptor, C3AR1, C5R1, FPRL1, PBEF, and IL-1\u03b2, which are important components of TH17 immune response. Neutrophilia has been observed in falciparum malaria, and elevated white blood cell counts are associated with severe malaria [15]. Gene network analysis of TGFB1/IL-6 or IL-17-related gene expression after malaria infection also suggested that malaria was TH17 dependent. Falciparum malaria often causes complications such as acute renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Neutrophil over-activation in TH17 immune response is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria, acute renal failure, and ARDS [16-18]. Thus, malaria-induced TH17 immune response could be related to both malaria-induced cerebral malaria, acute renal failure and ARDS.",

The major difference separating TH1 immune response and TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response are the effector cells involved. In the mouse model, interferon alpha/beta suppresses macrophage proliferation and neutrophiles and NK cells play a more prominent role, in contrast, IL-12 enhances macrophage proliferation and human derived macrophages can inhibit NK cells [19,20]. In addition, interferon alpha/beta increases NK cell blastogenesis, so alpha/beta interferon enhances NK cell proliferation [21]. Thus, interferon alpha/beta and IL-12-mediated immunological events can be distinguished by the different effector cells they enhance, NK cells or macrophages [22].",

Although administration of IL-12 can provide 100% protection against malaria parasite challenge, IL-12 plays a limited role in natural immune response against malaria in mice [1]. Active immunosuppression is well documented during malaria infection in mice [3]. IL-12 expression is down-regulated in this model [23]. According to an IRF1 knock-out study, mice can initiate TH1 immune response by bypassing the need for IL-12 production through the use of an alternate interferon alpha/beta driven pathway [24]. Based on recent microarray studies in malaria-infected mice, there is no evidence of IL-12 up-regulation following infection. Instead, interferon alpha/beta and its related genes were found to be significantly up-regulated [25,26], thus providing further evidence at the gene level that interferon alpha/beta can substitute for IL-12 in the induction of malaria-specific interferon gamma TH1 type immune response after infection in rodents. However, the IFN\u03b1\u03b2 driven TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response only can produce mid-to-moderate IFNg, and IL-10, the main effector molecule in TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response, antagonizes the effect of IFNg upon macrophages. Because the ideal traditional TH1 immune response cannot be triggered in natural malarial infection in human to clear out the protozoa, malaria parasites can cause severe illness in human.",

Administration of IL-12 to human subjects suppresses NK cell proliferation [29]. Macrophage activation serves to inhibit NK cell function, while NK cell activation serves to inhibit macrophage proliferation [19,30]. Given these observations, it is reasonable to speculate that these two effector cells belong to different immunological pathways. In the present study, this study found that a number of genes involved in the NK cell proliferation were up-regulated over the course of the malaria disease cycle (Table 1). In addition, as in the mouse model, genes associated with macrophage proliferation were not up-regulated following infection with P. falciparum. Increased NK cell populations have also been reported previously in acute malaria infection [31,32], thus, it appears that the interferon alpha/beta-NK cell pathway of TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response is preferentially enhanced after P. falciparum infection, while the IL-12 driven pathway appears unaffected. Other TH\u03b1\u03b2-related cytokines also can cause NK cell activation or proliferation including IL-10 and IL-15, respectively [33].",

            "text": "In human malarial infection, it has been shown that serum IL-12 levels are inversely correlated with malaria parasitaemia [6]. The more severe the malaria is, the lower IL-12 expression levels become. The uptake of malarial pigment (haemozoin) can down-regulate IL-12 secretion in human monocytes [5]. Malarial PGE2-like molecules can also down-regulate IL-12 secretion [34]. Up-regulation of CD36 by malarial infection can inhibit dendritic cell maturation with decreasing IL-12/IL-10 ratio [4]. Although haemozoin, in certain studies, can activate TLR9, which is for traditional TH1 immune response, TLR9 was not detected in this study. In previous microarray analysis of human malarial infection, interferon inducible genes were up-regulated with unchanged IL-12 expression [14,35]. Other important components of TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response included up-regulation of HMOX1, FAS, BCL6, TNFRSF10A, and MIP1\u03b1 were noted in Griffiths\u2019 research [14], which studied the peripheral blood leukocytes from Kenyan children with acute falciparum malaria. In this microarray study, this study ound up-regulation of interferon alpha/beta, interferon gamma, NK cell activating receptors, Fas, TRAIL, Fc gamma receptors, ADCC-related genes, IL-15, granzymes, and TH1 related chemokines (IP10, CXCL9, CXCL11, CCL3, CCL4, CCR1). These observations are, in general, consistent with the development of TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response characterized by NK cell activation induced by alpha/beta interferon following P. falciparum infection. Genes associated with TH1 immune response driven by IL-12 and macrophage activation (iNOS up-regulation) were unchanged after malarial infection. Gene coding for a number of macrophage de-activation molecules were up-regulated, including TGF\u03b2 receptor, CD36, CD163-Haem oxygenase1, and CD47-SIRP\u03b1. These molecules can actively suppress macrophage activation. When given alone and prior to malaria infection, IL-12 can provide 100% protection against experimental Plasmodium infection through the activation of macrophages, which help to control the liver stage of infection [1]. However, based on the data collected during the course of the current study, it also appears that infected individuals defend malaria through an alternate TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response, involving alpha/beta interferon and the activation of NK cells [36]. Interferon gamma plays a central role in immune response against malaria. However, the natural host immune response is suboptimal because IFN-\u03b3 is not the main effector in TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response. The major effector cells of TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response are NK cells, and the major effector cells of traditional TH1 immune response are macrophages.",

TH2 immune response is induced by STAT6 activated by IL-4. TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response is induced by STAT1 & STAT3\u03b1 activated by IFN-\u03b1\u03b2. TH1 immune response is induced by STAT4 activated by IL-12. TH17 immune response is induced by STAT3\u03b2 activated by TGF-\u03b2/IL-6 to induce downstream PMN related genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IL1, IL8). In TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 can suppress STAT6. IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 also suppress iNOS and IL-12 via IL-10 dependent mechanism. Up-regulated STAT1 can suppress GATA3 and STAT4. STAT1 can up-regulate IRF1, T-bet, IgG Fc receptors, Fas, C3a receptor. IRF1 induced TRAIL, T-bet induced NK cell killer receptors, and Fas can enhance NK cell cytotoxicity. Up-regulated IgG Fc receptors can mediate ADCC. In T cell, T-bet can up-regulate IFN-\u03b3. Up-regulated IFN-\u03b3 can activate STAT1 signalling via IFN-\u03b3 receptor. However, the IFN-\u03b3 receptor is suppressed during lymphocyte maturation. Thus, TH\u03b1\u03b2 immune response can be separated from TH1 immune response.",
