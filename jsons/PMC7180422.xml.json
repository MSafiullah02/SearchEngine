To contain this epidemic, Wuhan was locked down on January 23, 2020. Wenzhou, which has a population of 9.3 million and is located in southeastern China approximately 600 miles from Wuhan, is the most affected Chinese city outside of Hubei. Approximately 48 800 people traveled from Wuhan to Wenzhou from January 10 to 23, 2020. As of February 15, 2020, there were 502 confirmed cases of COVID-19 but no deaths reported in Wenzhou. To stop the spread of COVID-19 in Wenzhou, multiple community containment approaches were implemented beginning January 24, 2020, including quarantine, isolation, traffic control, and social distancing (Figure). This decision analytical model examined several key epidemiological features of imported COVID-19 cases in Wenzhou.",

Comparison of simulated and reported cumulative cases revealed that our model mimicked the actual spread well. Our estimates suggested that the epidemic would gradually vanish in late February and end in early March after the implementation of community containment approaches in Wenzhou. Then, we used our model to evaluate the impact of 4 different measures on total cumulative number of cases 6 months later. Our simulation showed that the intensity and starting time of control and prevention measures had major impacts on the spread of COVID-19. It is essential to prevent coronavirus transmission between susceptible and infected individuals by quarantine, isolation, and fewer contacts. The total mean (SEM) cumulative number of cases 6 months later would decrease to 440 (16) if the quarantine of infected individuals from the general population before they develop clinical symptoms (ie, asymptomatic individuals) was increased by 50% from the baseline. In contrast, the mean (SEM) number of cumulative cases would increase to 15 576 (1554) if measures were delayed for 5 days after the first diagnosed case. Similarly, the epidemic curves were constructed in Wuhan, suggesting that the COVID-19 epidemic would not stop until early April 2020.",

These findings suggest that quarantine of asymptomatic individuals is as important as isolation (hospitalization) of infected individuals with symptoms. Therefore, it is recommended that countries with severe epidemics strengthen epidemiological investigations and increase quarantine of close-contact individuals, especially when medical resources are scarce. A limitation of our epidemic analysis is that it is data-driven and limited by its applicability; however, these data have important implications in forecasting and preventing the potential spread of COVID-19 outbreaks in other countries.",
