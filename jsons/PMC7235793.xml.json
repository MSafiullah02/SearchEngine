            "text": "A growing body of evidence, especially over the last twelve years, suggests that the composition and function of the microbiota in different human body habitats play vital roles in human development and immunity [1,2,3]. The vagina and cervix have the lowest biodiversity, with a colonized epithelium dominated by Lactobacilli [4], thus being an interface that plays a protective role between the host and the environment. The cervix serves a pivotal role as a gatekeeper to protect the upper genital tract from microbial invasion and subsequent pathology. Recent studies have indicated that changes of the cervicovaginal microbiome [5,6,7], such as bacterial vaginosis [8,9], cervical inflammation [10,11] and vaginal pH [12,13], play a role in the susceptibility to cervical Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection and the development of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia due to the profound shifts in the relative abundances of protective bacteria [10]. Although cervical cancer is preventable mainly by vaccination, detection, and treatment of lesions, it remains an important public health problem, being the fourth and the second most common cancer in women globally and in developing countries, respectively (1). In Latin America and the Caribbean, it remains the number one cause of mortality due to malignant neoplasms among 20- to 40-year-old women (2), three times higher in Latin America than in the United States (US) (3). According to guidelines established by Healthy People [2], women that have had a Pap test in three subsequent years need to be at ~90%, however, in some areas of the world such as Latin America, this does not happen, with women often lost to follow-up even before treatment occurs.",

            "text": "Guidelines for genital care include coming to clinics for a Pap smear for HPV typing and cervical cytology, and for those who meet the guidelines, a return for a second visit to receive colposcopy and biopsy. These are invasive and expensive methods, and the approaches explained in this article are innovative and have the potential to be useful in advancing the field. A persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) types is a common, but not sufficient to cause cervical cancer [14,15]. High risk (hr) HPV infection often requires lifestyle factors for cancer development, such as smoking or oral contraceptive use [14], however, the reasons for hr HPV promotion and persistence are not completely understood. A gap in our understanding of HPV infection and carcinogenesis resides in the insufficient understanding of the true microbial community structure, preventing our ability to control the microbiota for therapeutic purposes. As widely known, the cervicovaginal microbiome also plays a role in disease pathogenesis in combination with HPV, namely genital dysbiosis, a modifiable risk factor for cervical disease [3,4,5,6]. A comparison of the vaginal microbiome in women of different ethnicities within the U.S. mainland indicates different relative abundances of the four main groups of Lactobacillus and anaerobic bacteria [4]. Different studies have described that infections with HPV are associated with an increase in Atopobium vaginae and G. vaginallis [5,11]. Other Latino populations, like Mexicans, have shown Sneathia spp. as a cervical biomarker for neoplasia [7]. Not only is bacterial biota associated with HPV, but studies have also found an important role of fungal signatures such as that of Malassezia for hr HPV infections and an increase in Sporidiobolaceae and Sacharomyces in atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) lesions [5,16]. Thus, non-Lactobacillus dominant communities, with a concomitant increase in pH and related to high-grade dysplasia, perturb amino acid and nucleotide metabolisms and drive inflammation and HPV infections. The combination of the microbiome with metabolome can become even more informative than classical HPV typing. Recently, microbial inventories via sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, have been complemented with metabolomics, adding a layer of information regarding the metabolic activities of the microbiome that helps elucidate the etiology of the microbiome-mediated disease [17,18]. Metabolites produced by commensal microorganisms may affect host metabolic processes, with both pathogenic and protective consequences. Multi-kingdom colonization (bacteria, Archaea, fungi, and viruses) associated with HPV infections in the vagina and cervix can produce metabolites which translocate through the host\u2019s barriers, that could influence systemic health effects in women at risk of developing cervical cancer. Indeed, recent findings suggest that cervical microbial metabolic changes may influence systemic health effects in women at risk of developing cervical cancer [18]. Recent data has been emerging on the usefulness of coupling microbiota inventories with systemic metabolomics in biofluids such as urine (that can be self-collected), thus easy to obtain and minimally invasive. Indeed, biomarkers for cervical cancer may be exfoliated as debris in urine, a kind of liquid biopsy\u2014which could facilitate diagnostics [1]. It is, therefore, important to develop protocols to help integrate information between the microbiome, viral pathogenesis, and immunity affecting cancer progression. Additional to microbiota analyses, one could develop shotgun metagenomic methods to understand the full diversity more accurately, including Archaea and viral composition affecting the dysbiotic or disease status. Indeed, shotgun approaches are useful methods that can non-specifically detect HPVs and other highly divergent viruses (specifically DNA viruses), using rolling circle amplification (RCA) [19], or even using meta-total RNA sequencing (MeTRS) methods based on shotgun sequencing of total RNA, which could reveal the extent of RNA viruses [20] (even the novel coronavirus\u2014SARS-CoV-2), which could lead to new methodologies to reveal the impact of the new virus on the microbiome and the immune response responsible for carcinogenesis. It is crucial to develop more microbiome/metabolome studies to understand cancer progression. The early detection and treatment of genital dysbiosis may facilitate better management of the disease [12]. As such, new quick tests that could monitor genital health based on the use of vaginal secretions and even urine could be useful. Dysbioses of the genital microbiome result in high pH due to the decrease in fermenting Lactobacillus, and create a genital microbiome/metabolome fingerprint, which in the future could be detected with different applications [21,22]. These metabolomic profiles require advanced diagnostics and point-of-care applications for which big data from microbiome and metabolome are needed. Here, we provide a unique and detailed guide for the development of multi-omic integration studies of the bacterial microbiota and urine metabolomics to understand possible biological associations with the host\u2019s urinary metabolites. This article discloses detailed materials, methods, sample processing, and data analyses. The coupling of two omic methods is a useful approach to understand the association of the human microbiome with health status and risk of disease severity, and for the development of new point-of-care testing technologies.",

At first use of the PCR master mix (vial A1), it is recommended to mix the contents of the vial on a Vortex mixer and aliquot the contents in ready-to-use portions of 40 \u03bcL. This further reduces the risk of contamination. After aliquoting, store at \u221220 \u00b0CPrepare the tubes/96-well plates (depending on the number of samples) considering the number of the samples to process and include negative and positive controls provided in the kit. Mark each PCR reaction vial/PCR plate.Spin down the liquid in the tubes with the processed specimen for 15 s at 14,000 rpm in a minicentrifuge.Add (one by one) 10 \u03bcL of the supernatant of the processed sample to the appropriate vials with PCR master mix. The vials intended for the HPV negative and positive PCR controls remain closed. Cap each vial after the addition of DNA before proceeding with the next.Mix HPV positive PCR control (vial B1) on a Vortex mixer, add 10 \u03bcL to the appropriate vial, and close the vial.Use clean filter tips for each sample and mix each sample with the PCR mix by pipetting up and down a few times.Insert the vials into the automatic thermal cycler and run the appropriate cycling program:9 min at 94 \u00b0C\n40 cycles of:\n30 s denaturation at 94 \u00b0C45 s annealing at 52 \u00b0C45 s elongation at 72 \u00b0C3 min at 72 \u00b0C (final elongation)Keep the amplified products at 2\u20138 \u00b0C for short-term storage or freeze at \u221220 \u00b0C for long term storage. In the second step, the amplified fragments undergo a line probe assay by reverse-hybridization assay performed by using the portion of the kit named RHA kit HPV SPF10-LiPA25. In this second step, the biotinylated amplicons are denatured and then hybridized with specific oligonucleotide probes immobilized as parallel lines in membrane strips. After immobilization of the oligonucleotides on the strips, these were washed, and streptavidin alkaline phosphatase (SAP) is added to bind to the biotinylated hybrid formed, yielding a purple precipitate in the strip that visually determines the specific HPV type compared to the kit-provided controls. The LiPA strips are visually inspected and interpreted following the standardized reference guide provided by the kit\u2019s manual.Prewarm the vials with the hybridization Solution (HS) and the Stringent Wash Solution (SW) to at least 37 \u00b0C but must not exceed the hybridization temperature of 49 \u00b0C (all crystals should be dissolved before the opening of the vial).Use 2 mL of hybridization solution for each strip + 15 mL in excess for each run.Use 6 mL of stringent wash solution for each strip + 30 mL in excess for each run.Rinse solution (RS) should be prepared by diluting the concentrated rinse solution 1/5 (1 part concentrated solution + 4 parts of water). Prepare 10 mL rinse solution for each strip + 55 mL in excess.Conjugate (C) solution and substrate solution should be prepared by diluting the concentrated conjugate or substrate 1/100 in conjugate diluent or substrate buffer, respectively. Mix gently.Prepare 2 mL conjugate solution and substrate solution for each strip + 5 mL in excess for 22 or less strips.In order to reduce the excess of buffer for each run with 22 or less strips, use a 50 mL conical tube and place it in the bottle provided with the ProfiBlotTM 48 T. When testing more than 22 strips an excess of 20 mL for each run is needed.Use 2 mL of substrate buffer for each strip + 5 mL in excess for each run with 22 or less strips. In order to reduce the excess of buffer for each run with 22 or less strips, use a 50 mL conical tube and place it in the bottle provided with the ProfiBlotTM 48 T.When testing more than 22 strips an excess of 20 mL for each run is needed.All vessels used to prepare conjugate and substrate solutions should be cleaned thoroughly and rinsed with water.The next step is a stringent wash using rinse solution and conjugate.Remove the tray from the water bathAspirate the liquid with a pipette. Add 2ml prewarmed SW to each strip.Shake the strips for 10 to 20 s at room temperature (RT). Aspirate the solution.Repeat the washing step.Aspirate the solution.Add 2ml of SW to each strip.Incubate in the shaking water at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min. Close the lid of the bath.Aspirate the Stringent Wash Solution.The final step is the strip color development. These steps will be at RT on a shaker (not on a water bath).Wash each strip twice for 1 min using 2 mL of Rinse Solution (RS). Aspirate.Add 2 mL of C (conjugate solution) to each sample and incubate for 30 min while shaking. At this point, prepare the substrate solution (S).Aspirate the C solution.Wash each strip twice for 1 min using 2ml of RS. Aspirate.Wash once more using 2 mL of substrate buffer (SB). Aspirate.Add 2 mL of the S solution an incubate for 30 min in the dark (cover with aluminium foil) while shaking. Stop the colour development by washing the strip twice in 2 mL of water while shaking for 3 min.Remove and place the strip with forceps in absorbent paper.Wait for the strip to dry completely.Compare strip bands with the interpretation sheet provided with the kit.",

It allows users to keep track of multiple studies with multiple omics data, and use stringent quality criteria PHRED scores (quality score of the nucleotides generated by automated DNA sequencing) with an ASCII offset of 33, and the user can choose the length of the reads for trimming, demultiplexing and binning using a given database (Greengenes, SILVA, or the Ribosomal Database Project-RDP). The usefulness of this platform is that it allows data to be directly made public via EBI (the European Bioinformatics Institute), a great service offered by the QIITA team at the University of California San Diego (UCSD).After the OTU table is prepared in QIITA, an alternative is to use QIIME2 for analyses or R packages such as Bioconductor [29] or the quick tool microbiomeanalyst (https://www.microbiomeanalyst.ca) for preliminary analyses [30].Reads matching chloroplast, mitochondria, and unassigned sequences should be removed as well as rare singletons.Downstream taxonomy plots, alpha and beta analyses should follow a given rarefaction level considering a minimum number of reads shared by most samples.Taxonomic barplots, alpha richness (number of OTUs/Operational Taxonomic Units) and geometric diversity boxplots (Shannon index of equitability [31]), can be built using R\u2019s ggplot package [32].Heatmaps can be built using the plot_heatmap function from the heatmap library [33].Additional analyses can be plotted using a microbiomeanalyst that integrates multiple R programs [30] and also includes LEfSe (Linear discriminant analysis effect size) analyses [34].For beta diversity, samples can be visualized using pairwise Bray\u2013Curtis distance between samples using the R package [35] with vegdist function in vegan [36]. The global differences in bacteria can be visualized with Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) or non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Alternatively, beta diversity can be visualized using UniFRAC [37].\n",

Storage is recommended under the vacuum at RT.Glass inserts decrease the surface area inside the vial allowing to achieve maximum sample recovery and easier sample removal.De-assemble the screw cap and remove silicone septum. Perforate it using scissors and mount the vials onto a rotary vacuum evaporator. This step is required to minimize sample cross-contamination during evaporation.Preparation of the reference pool quality control samples. Prepare a large pool sample during the preparation of sample extracts by aliquoting 100 \u00b5l from each 1 mL authentic subject sample. After a collection of a large pool sample, aliquot all for 1 mL in separate vials (thread 8-425), label all as reference quality controls and process similar to authentic subject samples. Continue as instructed in Section 3.3.7. The derivatization solution without the sample only, and empty vials, must also be included as quality controls in the analysis to ensure that identified metabolites are derived from the sample [46].Attach the glass vials to the rotary evaporator [47].Derivatization Solution 1 must be freshly prepared.During derivatization, avoid contact with moisture, which will result in metabolite degradation. If samples are not dried, it is necessary to proceed to additional evaporation as said in Sections 3.4.9\u20133.4.11.Derivatization Solution 2 must be used from freshly opened vials.If an analysis is performed after samples preparation, wait two hours before injecting the first sample into the GC-MS.The sample concentration must be adequately adjusted to give sufficient chromatogram, then it needs to be concentrated before injecting the sample into the gas chromatograph. The dilution of a sample (1:50) was found to be sufficient for the analysis. However, if the signal is too low, the concentration could be increased. Derivatization solution without the sample only, and empty vials, must also be included as quality controls in the analysis to ensure that identified metabolitesMS detects the mass of the molecular ions and the masses of the fragment ions. The database contains extensive information on many compounds including the masses of fragment ions that help to perform successful metabolite identification. In addition, to ensure a valid peak identification, data can be also processed using a deconvolution method, which is a signal processing technique that estimates the relative area corresponding to each peak when multiple peaks overlap within the same spectral region. This is especially important for low abundant metabolites that might co-elute with abundant major peaks. For general quadrupole mass spectrometers, data deconvolution by the freely available software AMDIS is recommended (http://chemdata.nist.gov/mass-spc/amdis/).Some of the metabolite\u2019s so-called \u201cmissing values\u201d will not be identified in chromatograms. Therefore, when composing the table for the analysis, missing values should be presented as empty values or NA without quotes.MetaboAnalyst is a web server designed to permit comprehensive metabolomics data analysis, visualization, and interpretation [39]. The web interfaces of MetaboAnalyst are designed to be self-explanatory. Therefore, most steps are documented on top of the corresponding pages. Available tutorials and sample data sets complement the information by providing step-by-step instructions for several most common tasks.This step is strongly recommended for metabolomics datasets with a large number of variables (more than 2000 metabolites) since many of them are from baseline noises. Usually, the GC/MS analysis of brain tissues could identify less than 60 variables.The normalization procedures are grouped into three categories. The sample normalization allows general-purpose adjustment for differences among your sample, which can include the protein content in the sample or intensity value of internal standard spiked into the derivatization mixture before GC/MS analysis. Data can be further transformed by \u201clog\u201d or \u201ccube root\u201d and/or scaled via \u201cmean centering, autoscaling, Pareto scaling, and range scaling\u201d (please see the description of each in the MetaboAnalyst program). According to [48] autoscaling and range scaling performed better than the other pretreatment methods and showed biologically sensible results in chemometrics analysis. Data transformation and scaling are two different approaches to make individual features more comparable that can be used individually or in combination. Scaling is a useful procedure when variables are of very different orders of magnitude [49].Detect outliers. This can be carried out by visual inspection of the PCA plot to identify samples-outliers outside the Hotelling T2 95% confidence ellipse [40]. Many outliers could be corrected by normalization or excluded from the analysis. In many cases, outliers are the result of operational errors during the analytical process. If those values cannot be corrected, they should be removed from the analysis, but always justified [39]. Please refer to MetaboAnalyst.ca tutorials, or FAQ to select the statistical analysis method.Well-predicted metabolites were identified by the Community Metabolic Potential (CMP) scores model in groups by examining of the total pool of metabolites with positive model slope and a model p-value < 0.1. Given that MIMOSA2 is prone to false negatives because its model is approximate, it requires a weak statistical threshold (p-value < 0.1) to capture more relationships of possible interest [18,41,42].

            "text": "We are assisting a new stage of microbiome research, which moves beyond the typical 16S profiles listing bacteria associated to a given body site or disease, and offers the novel integration of other omics approaches, towards a better understanding of community functions in the disease, and interactions with the host. Emphasis is now given to the causality of microbiome research and the development of mechanistic understandings of the influence of microbiota, including their metabolic activities. Thus, the integration of metagenomics and metabolomics is becoming a very promising approach in the exploration of associations between the host microbiome and circulating metabolites with the aim of understanding the complex bacterial interactions with the host and their contributions to systemic health. Using urine as a liquid biopsy is gaining more popularity. Indeed, evidence suggests that biomarkers for cervical cancer may be exfoliated as debris in urine, which could facilitate diagnostics [50]. Since circulating metabolites are finally excreted through urine [51], recent studies suggest that exploring the association between urine metabolome and host microbiome (gut or even cervicovaginal) may complement sequencing-based approaches with a functional readout of the host microbiome and its interaction with host [52,53]. Indeed, a recent study coupling gut microbiome and urine metabolomics suggests that gut bacterial compositional changes could eventually be monitored and probed using urine metabolomics [52]. In addition, the application of the current protocol for functional characterization of vaginal and cervical hr HPV microbiota and urinary metabolome has identified species-contributors to the pool of several circulating urinary metabolites associated with cervical cancer development [18]. The high throughput analyses of these two datasets could be key for the development of new tools (like portable devices) to give women feasible self-testing, and to allow them to be informed of their cervicovaginal dysbiosis via vaginal or urine metabolomic screening, which could benefit low-income countries, and those with a lack of access to cervical surveillance.",
