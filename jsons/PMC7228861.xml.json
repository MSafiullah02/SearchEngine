In our transgender and gender diverse communities, we have identified the need to collect and map these resources, gather them into an accessible and updatable format, and disseminate them among our participants as well as provide direct and tailored referrals. To this end, the UCSF Center of Excellence for Transgender Health, the UCSF Center for Sexual and Gender Minority Health, and the UCSF LGBT Resource Center teamed up to present a Grand Rounds webinar on COVID-19 information and resources specific to our communities.",
