The field of proteomics aims at studying the expression, structure, and function of all proteins on the whole genome level. It has been estimated that human genome consists of 19 000 genes coding for \u223c500 000 proteins.1 Over 80 % of all proteins do not exist in isolation, but rather interact with one another to form stable or transient complexes.2 Protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs) thus play a central role in virtually all biological processes, such as metabolism, transport, structural organization, signal transduction, cell\u2010cycle control, immune recognition, and gene transcription.3 Completion of a genome sequencing project is normally accompanied with a vast growth of unannotated proteins. Identification of PPIs assists in functional assignment of novel proteins by situating them relative to other proteins in cellular pathways or functional classes,4 derives a better understanding of the biological relevance of protein functions, and provides key information from which to elucidate the functioning of a living cell under both physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, investigation of PPIs on a large scale, that is, so\u2010called interactomes, is the foundation for systematic analysis of cellular networks. Cells can be envisioned as a complex web involving innumerable PPIs. Mapping PPI networks for model organisms and human to elucidate the organization of the proteome is one of the important goals for systems biology research, which paves the way to unravel the functional, logical and dynamical aspects of cellular systems.5\n",

            "text": "The theory of fluorescence polarization (FP) was first described in 1926,17 and it is based on the observation of the molecular movement of fluorophores in solution. When a fluorophore is excited by polarized light, it emits light with unequal intensities along different axes of polarization. The degree of polarization is inversely related to molecular rotation of the fluorophore, which is largely dependent on molecular mass. Typically, larger masses show slower rotation.18 With adequate experimental design, an FP assay can be used to measure binding and dissociation between two molecules if one of the binding molecules is relatively small and labeled with a fluorophore (Figure 1 A). Commonly used fluorophores for an FP assay include fluorescein, rhodamine, BODIPY (boron\u2010dipyrromethene), and Cy5 (cyanine\u20105) dyes, or their derivatives. Complex formation leads to an increase in FP signal (in millipolarization units, mP), which can be measured by a microplate reader. A binding curve can be generated by plotting mP values against multiple concentrations of the labeled molecule. Then, the dissociation constant (K\nd) between two binding molecules can be determined from the curve.\n",

As PPIs are often governed by a small number of \u201cbinding epitopes\u201d, for example, hot spots, utilizing short truncated motifs containing such epitopes mimics the interactions between two complete protein molecules and thus facilitates experimental measurements. Such an FP assay also provides an opportunity for the detection of inhibitors targeting the PPI.22 For instance, an FP competition assay has been developed to identify inhibitors targeting the MDM2\u2013p53 peptide interaction,23 to screen small molecules that inhibit the ZipA\u2013FtsZ peptide interaction,24 to screen natural product extracts that disrupt the binding of antiapoptotic Bcl\u20102 family members to Bim BH3 peptides.25 The advantages of an FP assay are its low cost, simple mix\u2010and\u2010read format without wash steps, and the high\u2010throughput screening (HTS) capacity of the assay when carried out in a multiwell plate (96/384/1,536).

            "text": "Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is a quantum electromagnetic phenomenon that occurs at a metal\u2010dielectric interface. When a photon of lights hits the metal surface (typically a gold film) at a certain angle of incidence, the light energy is transferred to collective excitations of free electrons, called surface plasmons, and generates electromagnetic waves that propagate along the interface. Resonant transfer of light energy to surface plasmons leads to a sharp attenuation in the reflected light. The angle of incidence at which minimum reflection occurs is defined as the SPR angle. A slight change near the interface (e.g., a change in refractive index in the vicinity of the metal surface) leads to a change in the SPR angle.27, 28 A biosensor system based on SPR has become one of the most popular sensing technology for measuring molecular interactions. In an SPR experiment, the bait protein is first immobilized onto the sensor chip, which is then perfused with buffer solution containing analytes. If interaction occurs, the accumulation of analytes on the sensor surface induces an increase in the refractive index at the sensor surface, and the SPR angle is shifted (Figure 1 B). During dissociation, the inverse effect is observed. The RU (termed response or resonance unit) is recorded to describe this signal change, where one RU is equivalent to a critical angle shift of 10\u22124 degree.29 Since the first commercial SPR\u2010based analytical instrument launched by Biacore AB in 1990, other competing SPR biosensor systems have been developed by manufacturers such as Affinity Sensors, IBIS Technologies, Texas Instruments, Aviv, and BioTul AG.30 As the interface between the sensor surface and the interacting proteins to be studied is a vital component of this surface\u2010sensitive sensor system, several robust and reproducible sensor chips from Biacore are commercially available, such as the CM5 chip (carboxymethylated dextran covalently attached to a gold surface) for immobilization via amine, thiol, aldehyde, or carboxyl groups of proteins, the NTA chip (carboxymethylated dextran pre\u2010immobilized with nitrilotriacetic acid) for immobilization of His\u2010tagged proteins, SA chip (carboxymethylated dextran pre\u2010immobilized with streptavidin) for immobilization of biotinylated proteins.31\n",

A potential limitation is its sensitivity to interfering effects such as nonspecific interaction between the sensor surface and analyte.35 Additionally, the requirement for immobilization might disturb the interactions under measurement. The SPR technique has traditionally been used in low\u2010throughput studies as standard SPR biosensor only contains three to four flow cells on a single sensor chip. Nowadays, SPR imaging (SPRI) is extended towards HTS. By utilizing protein array technology and a charge\u2010coupled device (CCD) camera to make images based on the intensity of reflected light, SPRI has been developed to simultaneously process hundreds or thousands of samples.28, 36 Furthermore, using the SPR technique coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) enables the discovery of novel PPIs.[27, 37]\n",

Various NMR parameters providing angular or distance data are primary sources of conformational information, including (1) chemical shift perturbation, which is the chemical shift (resonance frequency) change of a nucleus in the protein induced after addition of an interacting partner. In particular, heteronuclear single\u2010quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR experiments are widely used to delineate protein\u2013protein interfaces;39, 40 (2) the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) is the NMR equivalent of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), discussed later in Section 3.1, referring to the transfer of nuclear spin polarization from one nuclear spin population to another via dipolar cross\u2010relaxation, the intensity of which is proportional to the inverse\u2010sixth power of the distance between two nuclei. Many precise NOE\u2010derived distance constraints between two proteins with tight interaction (K\nd\u226410 \u03bcm) can be used to determine the full 3D structure of the complex;41, 42 (3) paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE), arising from magnetic dipolar interactions between the unpaired electron in a paramagnetic center and a nearby NMR\u2010active nucleus, provides long\u2010range distance information that can complement NOE restraints;43, 44 (4) residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), reporting on relative orientations among internuclei vectors irrespective of their distance separations, can provide orientation restraints for structural characterization of protein complexes.45, 46 Other NMR data includes cross\u2010saturation, pseudo\u2010contact shift, J coupling, and so on.

Neither is there any need for immobilization or modification of proteins.73 However, extreme care must be taken in the use of a buffer in an ITC experiment, that is, both interacting proteins in the sample cell as well as the syringe should be dialyzed in an identical buffer to minimize the artifacts generated by mismatched buffer components.74 The main parameters extracted from ITC experiment include association constant (K\na), enthalpy change (\u0394H), reaction stoichiometry (n), heat capacity change (\u0394C\np), free energy change (\u0394G) and entropy change (\u0394S).75 These data help us better understand both the affinities and mechanisms of PPIs, for example, estimating the hydrophobic effect of a residue at protein\u2013protein interface by calculating changes in solvent portion of the binding entropy,76 determining exact contributions to binding including solvation, protonation, and structural rearrangements,77 validating oligomeric state of a protein during binding events according to stoichiometry data.78\n",

            "text": "Microscale thermophoresis (MST) emerged as a new powerful technique for quantitative analysis of PPIs in free solution, which has been applied widely in academia and industry. This technique detects the directed motion of molecules in a microscopic temperature gradient, an effect termed thermophoresis. This effect is highly sensitive to binding\u2010induced changes in various molecular properties, such as size, charge, conformation or hydration shell.84 In a typical MST experiment, one of the interacting proteins is fluorescently labeled. It is normally done by using N\u2010hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) dye to react with a primary amine group on the labeled protein, or a recombinant protein fused to a fluorescent protein such as green fluorescent protein (GFP). Alternatively, MST can be performed in a label\u2010free manner, in which the intrinsic UV\u2010fluorescent signal of the aromatic amino acid residues is detected. A MST instrument uses an infrared (IR) laser to heat a defined sample volume inside a capillary and produces a temperature gradient spanning 2\u20136 K. The thermophoretic movement of the fluorescent protein is measured by detecting the fluorescence emission of the heat spot within the sample before, during, and after the IR laser is switched on. Before heating, the initial fluorescence is recorded at a constant level. Once the IR laser is switched on, the increase of temperature leads to an abrupt decrease in fluorescence intensity, so called temperature jump (T\u2010jump). After that, the fluorescence decreases slowly (thermophoresis) until reaching a steady state. When the IR laser is switched off, the fluorescence recovery (inverse T\u2010jump and back\u2010diffusion) is observed85, 86, 87 (Figure 1 D). During this procedure, both T\u2010jump and the thermophoresis process can be affected by a binding event due to changes in size, charge or hydration shell. Hence, MST can be applied to determine dissociation constants of PPIs via titration, in which a constant concentration of fluorescent protein and varying concentrations of its nonfluorescent binding partner are applied.84, 88, 89\n",

Thereafter, several other versions of BRET with different substrates and energy donor\u2013acceptor pairs have been developed, for example, BRET2, with GFP2 (a blue\u2010shifted variant of GFP) as the acceptor and a modified coelenterazine, DeepBlueC, as the substrate for Rluc, leading to increased spectral separation between donor and acceptor emission.132 Extended BRET (eBRET) enables the investigation of PPIs in real time over extended timescales by using a protected form of coelenterazine h, termed EnduRenTM.133 BRET3 exhibits several fold improvement in light intensity by using RLuc8 and mOrange as the donor and acceptor, respectively.134 NanoBRET, with a coelenterazine derivative (furimazine) as the donor and a chloroalkane derivative of nochloro TOM (NCT) dye as the acceptor, provides improved spectral resolution and greater light intensity.135 Sometimes microscopic imaging for BRET is limited due to its low level of light emission from bioluminescent reactions.

It has been widely applied as a diagnostic tool in medical sciences, a quality control in various industries, as well as a quantitative method for assessing PPIs at physiological conditions and screening for PPI inhibitors.187, 188, 189 To measure a PPI in the direct ELISA format, the protein of interest is noncovalently coated to a polystyrene microwell plate through passive adsorption. After washing away excess free protein, the remaining available binding surfaces of the wells are blocked with nonreacting protein such as bovine serum albumin (BSA). Then, the sample solution containing the binding partner protein is added and incubated in the wells to interact with the immobilized protein. After another washing step, a primary antibody against the binding partner protein with an attached enzyme, for example horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or alkaline phosphatase (AP), is applied as a detection antibody. Finally, a substrate for the enzyme is added, which elicits a chromogenic or fluorescent signal upon enzymatic reaction. The amount of the binding partner protein bound to the immobilized protein is quantified through absorbance\u2010 or fluorescence\u2010based readout190 (Figure 2 H). ELISA can also be performed in an indirect format in which the binding partner protein is detected by a primary antibody and an enzyme\u2010linked secondary antibody, or in a sandwich format in which the protein of interest is coated to the plate through a pre\u2010coated \u201ccapture\u201d antibody.

For protein purification, affinity tags such as His*6, GST, FLAG, maltose binding protein, are fused to either the C or N terminus of these proteins, which can facilitate purification by using specific resins.

Biophysical methods, such as AUC and ITC, are often based on long\u2010standing physical principles. They have started to show good performance in studying the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic aspects of PPIs owing to dramatic improvements in instrumentation. Biochemical methods, such as affinity chromatography, are also frequently applied together with MS techniques to identify the binding partners of the protein of interest. During the past decade, genomics revolution has assisted in the construction of genome\u2010scale cDNA and ORF collections, which facilitates PPI identification and PPI network mapping on a large scale with high\u2010throughput genetic methods, such as Y2H, phage display, and protein microarray. It should be kept in mind that all methods have their own limitations, and these can lead to false positives and negatives in detection. Therefore, validation of PPIs using methods based on different techniques is recommended to produce reliable results. For example, potential PPIs discovered by genetic methods can be further confirmed by biochemical assays. Finally, it is important to note that, since experimental measurements have generated a wealth of data, there is an increasing demand for publicly accessible databases that collect and record such data in some standard formats. More powerful bioinformatic tools are also much needed to convert raw data into useful knowledge.",

When a fluorescently labelled small molecule is excited by polarized light, it emits lights with a certain degree of polarization that is inversely proportional to the rotation rate of the fluorescent molecule. A small molecule rotates fast, so the emitted lights are depolarized. Its rotation is greatly decreased when it binds to a larger molecule, so the emitted light remains polarized. B) Surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In an SPR biosensor, an incident light beam hits a prism covered with a thin gold film at a certain angle, leading to the phenomenon of SPR. Perturbations at the gold surface on the sensor chip, such as the interaction between the bait immobilized on the surface and the prey flown over the surface, result in detectable SPR angle shifts. C) Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). An ITC instrument is composed of a reference cell and a sample cell, both of which are surrounded by an adiabatic jacket. During measurement, a protein molecule loaded in the syringe is titrated into the sample cell containing its binding partner, causing heat changes in the sample cell. This heat change can be quantified by the electric power required to maintain the isothermal condition between two cells. D) Microscale thermophoresis (MST). The sample solution containing fluorescent molecules inside a capillary is heated by a focused IR\u2010laser, which is coupled into the path of fluorescence excitation and emission. A series of processes, including initial state, T\u2010jump, thermophoresis, steady state, inverse T\u2010jump, and back\u2010diffusion of fluorescent molecules can be detected through the temperature gradient.",

            "text": "Figure 2: Illustration of some biochemical methods for PPI detection. A) Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a CFP\u2010fused bait and a YFP\u2010fused prey, where CFP and YFP act as the donor and the acceptor fluorophore, respectively. If the bait and the prey do not interact, excitation of CFP results in light emission (475 nm) by CFP only. When bait\u2013prey interaction occurs, CFP and YFP are brought into proximity, leading to energy transfer from CFP to nearby YFP. Then, YFP emission can be detected at 528 nm. B) Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) between a Rluc\u2010fused bait and a EYFP\u2010fused prey, where Rluc and EYFP act as the donor luciferase and the acceptor fluorophore, respectively. If bait and prey do not interact, only the blue\u2010emitting spectrum (480 nm) of RLuc can be detected. When bait\u2013prey interaction occurs, bioluminescence energy generated by Rluc in the presence of its substrate (coelenterazine) is transferred to EYFP, which in turn generates light emission at 530 nm. C) AlphaScreen. Upon excitation at 680 nm, a photosensitizing agent on the donor bead converts ambient oxygen to singlet oxygen. When bait\u2013prey interaction brings the donor and the acceptor bead into close proximity, energy is transferred from singlet oxygen to thioxene derivatives on the acceptor bead, resulting in light emission at 520\u2013620 nm. D) Protein\u2010fragment complementation assay (PCA). Complementary C\u2010terminal and N\u2010terminal fragments of GFP are fused to the bait and the prey, respectively. If the bait and the prey do not interact, the fragments remain unstructured and lack functional activity. When the bait\u2013prey interaction occurs, two fragments are brought together to form a full\u2010length GFP with the native structure and function. E) Pull\u2010down assay. In a GST pull\u2010down assay, the bait is expressed as a GST\u2010fused protein, and it is incubated with cell or tissue lysate containing the prey. The GST\u2013bait\u2013prey complex is captured by glutathione\u2010coupled beads and eluted for analysis by SDS\u2010PAGE. F) Tandem affinity purification (TAP). In this type of assay, the TAP tag (including CBP, a TEV cleavage site, and ProtA) is fused to the bait, and then the whole construction is introduced into the host cell. The TAP\u2013bait\u2013prey complex is isolated from cell lysate via affinity column containing IgG beads. After washing, TEV protease is added to release the CBP\u2013bait\u2013prey complex, which is then immobilized on calmodulin\u2010coated beads. After washing, the native complex is eluted by chelating calcium using EGTA. G) Co\u2010immunoprecipitation (Co\u2010IP). The bait\u2013prey complex in cell or tissue lysate is captured by beads functionalized with a bait\u2010specific antibody, and then co\u2010precipitated, washed, eluted, and analyzed by SDS\u2010PAGE. H) ELISA. In the case of direct ELISA, the bait is immobilized on a microwell plate, and then cell lysate containing the prey is applied to the wells. After incubation and washing away unbound proteins, the bait\u2013prey complex is detected by an HRP\u2010conjugated antibody against the prey. Finally, a substance of the HRP enzyme is added, which in turn produces detectable fluorescence\u2010 or absorbance\u2010based signal via the enzymatic reaction. I) Proximity ligation assay (PLA). The bait and prey are recognized by their respective PLA probes consisting of antibodies and single\u2010stranded DNA oligonucleotides, where the free oligonucleotide ends are brought into proximity. An oligonucleotide connecter is added to hybridize to the complementary oligonucleotides on the PLA probes. A ligase seals the nick between two PLA probes and forms a new DNA strand that can be amplified by PCR.",

The remaining phages are then eluted, amplified by bacterial infection, and enriched in repeated selection cycles, that is, the \u201cpanning\u201d process. B) The yeast two\u2010hybrid (Y2H) system. The binding domain (BD) and activation domain (AD) are two separate fragments of the transcription factor GAL4. They are fused to the bait and prey, respectively, where BD is responsible for binding to the upstream activating sequence (UAS) and AD is responsible for activation of transcription. The bait\u2013prey interaction brings BD and AD into proximity to form an intact and functional transcriptional activator, which in turn recruits the basal transcriptional machinery and induces transcription of a downstream reporter gene lacZ. C) Protein microarray. A library of proteins is spotted onto a solid surface. This array is then incubated with a labelled bait.
