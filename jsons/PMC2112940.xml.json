SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV.2, 3 Its emergence affected more than 8000 individuals and caused more than 800 deaths within a few months.4 This signifies just how rapidly a contagious illness can spread in the more mobile and highly interconnected world in the 21st century. Remarkably, the world has witnessed how concerted international cooperation allowed health experts to identify the novel etiologic agent and contain the SARS epidemic just months after its emergence. Currently, there is no known SARS transmission anywhere in the world. At the same time, there is no guarantee that this outbreak will not strike again in an even more severe form. Thus far, no effective therapy exists for this viral infection.",

SARS-CoV 3CLpro is functionally analogous to the main picornaviral protease 3Cpro and there have been significant drug-design efforts against human rhinoviral 3C protease which is also a cysteine protease.10 We recently described structure-based design of a number of potent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors.11 These inhibitors were designed based upon modification of AG7088, a potent inhibitor of the human rhinoviral 3C protease.12 While AG7088 does not exhibit inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro, the modified inhibitors are active in enzymatic assays as well as in cell culture assays.13 The X-ray structure of inhibitor-bound SARS-3CLpro revealed important molecular insight into the ligand-binding sites of enzyme.11 The inhibitors bind to SARS-CoV 3CLpro through covalent bonding with the active site cysteine 145 residue. Based upon this molecular insight, we have now modified our initial inhibitors to accommodate specific ligand-binding site interactions in the S4-subsite of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro active site. Herein we describe the synthesis, biological evaluation, and X-ray structures of inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV 3CLpro for two potent peptide and peptidomimetic inhibitors (Fig. 1\n).",

His-172 makes hydrogen bond with the P1-lactam-NH, and the Glu-166 nitrogen makes a hydrogen bond with the ketone of the inhibitor.11 The P4-oxazole group appears to fill in the S4-hydrophobic pocket. Based upon this X-ray structure, we subsequently speculated that the replacement of P4-oxazole with a Boc-Serine P4-ligand would promote additional hydrogen-bonding interactions in the S4-site. This will result in further enhancement of inhibitory potency. We have also evaluated the corresponding peptide-derived inhibitors for our studies.",

The reaction components, with the exception of substrate, were incubated for 20 min and the reaction was initiated by the addition of FRET-substrate [AlexaFluor\u00ae 488-cys]-Glu-Ser-Ala-Thr-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Leu-Ala-[Lys-QSY\u00ae-7]-Ser, giving a final substrate concentration of 1 \u03bcM.11, 16 The IC50 values for inhibitors were determined by measuring the rates of reaction with increasing inhibitor concentrations. As shown in Table 1, our structure-based incorporation of P4-Boc-Ser in place of P4-oxazole in inhibitor 2 resulted in (inhibitor 3) significant enhancement of enzymatic inhibitory potency, while its antiviral activity was not improved. It exhibited antiviral activity similar to inhibitors 1 and 2. This difference of activity may be due to the presence of peptide-like features in the inhibitors. Peptide-like molecules often exhibit poor passive transcellular diffusion across cell membranes. Antiviral assays followed our previously published protocol.11, 18 We have compared the binding affinity of the corresponding peptide-based inhibitors incorporating both P4-oxazole and P4-Boc Ser. Peptide-based inhibitors (4 and 5) with P2-Leu and P2-Phe have displayed 20-fold enzymatic potency enhancement over the respective inhibitors (16 and 17) containing P4-oxazole.",

A stereoview of the inhibitor-bound structure is shown in Figure 2\n. The X-ray structure reveals that the inhibitor is covalently bonded to the enzyme via a C\u2013S bond (1.77 \u00c5) to the active site cysteine (Cys-145). The P1\u2032-ethyl ester carbonyl is within proximity to Thr-26 oxygen (3.38\u00c5). The Leu-27 side chain makes hydrophobic contacts with the P1\u2032-ligand. Furthermore, the P1-lactam NH forms a hydrogen bond with the imidazole ring of His-163. The P3-carbonyl group of 3 forms a hydrogen bond with the NH of Glu-166. The P4-Ser side chain is within hydrogen-bonding distance of Glu 166. This may explain its enhanced binding affinity over the oxazole-bearing inhibitor 2.",

An X-ray structure of the 3-bound enzyme provided critical molecular insight into the ligand-binding site interactions in the active site. It appears that the P4-Boc-Ser is involved in important hydrogen-bonding interactions in the S4\u2032-subsite. The present molecular insight will facilitate the design of more effective inhibitors. Further investigations are in progress.",
