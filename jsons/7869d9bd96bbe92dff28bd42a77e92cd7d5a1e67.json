            "text": "Background: Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) show variable sensitivities in clinical settings. We aimed to compare three digital RIDTs and one conventional RIDT. Methods: We assessed 218 nasopharyngeal swabs from patients between neonates and 90 years old in 2016. Three digital RIDTs were BUDDI, Sofia Influenza A+B Fluorescence Immunoassay, Veritor System Flu A+B assay. One conventional test was the SD Bioline Influenza Ag A/B/A(H1N1/2009). All test results were compared with those from the Anyplex Flu A/B Typing Real-time Detection real-time PCR. The four RIDTs were tested with diluted solutions from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) to compare lower detection limit. Cross-reactivity of four RIDTs within other respiratory viruses was identified. Results: For influenza A, BUDDI, Sofia, Veritor, and Bioline showed 87.7%, 94.5%, 87.7%, and 72.6% sensitivity, and 100%, 97.7%, 96.5%, and 100% specificity. For influenza B, BUDDI, Sofia, Veritor, and Bioline showed 81.7%, 91.7%, 81.7%, and 78.3% sensitivity, and 100%, 95.3%, 100%, and 100% specificity, respectively. Each RIDT could detect diluted NIBSC solution, according to the level of dilution and specific influenza subtypes. Cross-reactivity of four RIDTs with other respiratory viruses was not noted. Conclusions: Sofia showed the highest sensitivity for influenza A and B detection. BUDDI and Veritor showed higher detection sensitivity than a conventional RIDT for influenza A detection, but similar results for influenza B detection. Further study is needed to compare the test performance of RIDTs according to specific, prevalent influenza subtypes.

            "text": "Seasonal influenza infection can be a burden on public health authorities. Rapid diagnosis is an important initial step in the appropriate management of influenza disease. Traditionally, viral cultures, serological tests, rapid antigen tests, and molecular methods have been used to diagnose influenza infection. 1 Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) have been used widely in the clinical setting because they can be handled readily and at relatively low cost, although they have low and variable detection sensitivities. Thus, a negative RIDT result does not confirm a status free of influenza virus infection. The clinical sensitivities of these tests have been reported to range from 20% to 90%, according to sample collection method, storage and transport, specimen type, swab and transport media used, and degree of adherence to manufacturers' recommendations for test procedures. 1 The performance of RIDTs is also dependent on the prevalence of the influenza viruses circulating in the population. 2, 3 Furthermore, clinicians should be cautious about using RIDTs in certain patient populations and with respect to how the results should be interpreted. [3] [4] [5] Thus, further validation of RIDTs should be provided before routine clinical use. In this study, we compared three RIDTs with digital readout systems, and one conventional RIDT, with respect to the detection sensitivity and relative limit of detection according to influenza subtype.",

Briefly, an antibody colloidal gold probe was applied on the conjugate pad, and influenza antibody was immobilized to a nitrocellulose membrane as the capture reagent to prepare the RIDT strip test. Equal volumes of specimen in UTM (75 \u03bcL) and reagent buffer (75 \u03bcL) were mixed thoroughly and five drops (100 \u03bcL) of mixed sample was loaded into the test device. In 15 minutes, the BUDDI device reads the intensity of the reaction band. If the band intensity is higher than a cut-off level, BUDDI reports a positive result of influenza infection. This test required less than 30 minutes to accomplish the qualitative detection of influenza antigen. The results of the BUDDI system can be transferred to a central laboratory or the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) via an appropriate wireless network.",

The system comprises a unique reagent tube containing mucolytic agents and a detergent solution, a test device, and a digital reader. When nasal or nasopharyngeal swab specimens are processed with the reagent tube and added to the test device, influenza A or B viral antigens bind to anti-influenza antibodies conjugated to detector particles in the test strip. The antigen-conjugate complex migrates across the test strip to the reaction area, and is captured by antibodies against influenza A, influenza B, and a control antibody on three separate membranes. 6 For this study, 75 \u03bcL of specimen in UTM was mixed with an equal volume of lysis buffer (75 \u03bcL). Three drops (80 \u03bcL) of the mixed sample were placed into a Veritor test device cassette and allowed 10 minutes for incubation.

Second, the mean age of the enrolled individuals was relatively young, at 10-32.2 years, for a random selection within a specific period. Cruz et al. 2 reported that the performance of RIDTs have been known to be better in children compared with adults (approximately 13% higher), maybe due to higher viral loads and longer viral shedding in children compared with adults. We also identified the higher sensitivity of four RIDTs in children group than those of adults in our study. Third, test results were compared only with those of real-time PCR, which could have false positives and negatives. Also, only nasopharyngeal swab specimens were included, without considering specimen variations. However, for the first time, this study presented the detection sensitivity of a newly developed digital readout system, BUDDI. The BUDDI had the same detection sensitivity as a previously launched RIDT (Veritor), and higher sensitivity than a conventional RIDT. However, BUDDI showed less sensitivity than Sofia. Also, BUDDI could detect more than other RIDTs in terms of specific influenza biotypes, such as influenza A A/Texas/36/91, A/Beijing/262/95, and A/Sydney/5/97.",
