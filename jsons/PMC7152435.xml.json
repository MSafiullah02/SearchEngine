Hyenas as a group communicate through vocalizations, body posture, and scent marking, the last of which is highly developed in the brown hyena and consists of two components, which dry to different colors and consistency on prominent vegetation (Figure 51-1\n).",

They live in small clans composed of several females, males, and offspring. Clans are rather female bonded, and females are believed to be related (Wiesel, personal communication). Nomadic males are believed to maintain genetic diversity by ranging across clan territories. Males and females are morphologically similar. All clan members participate in communal raising of offspring. Although they are predominantly scavengers, brown hyenas actively hunt and consume Cape fur seal pups (Arctocephalus pusillus) along the Namibian coast.24 In more arid areas, brown hyenas also consume plant material such as Tsama (Citrullus lanatus) and gemsbok cucumbers (Acathosicyos naudinianus).15 Diamond mining, vehicular trauma, and human encroachment threaten existing populations of the brown hyena. Estimates of population size range from 5000 to 8000 in the wild and an estimated 800 to 1000 individuals in Namibia. Brown hyenas are not housed in North American zoos and are rarely exhibited in international zoos.",

The genitalia of both sexes appear similar; the female exhibits a peniform clitoris; the vagina has fused with the urethra into a common urogenital tract and terminates in a phallic opening.12, 16 Modification of the labia has developed into a false scrotum, containing organized adipose tissue. This modification of the reproductive tract is under the androgenizing effects of androstenedione.8 This modification appears to enforce maternal dominance of clan society.15 Females of this species are larger than their male counterparts. Spotted hyenas are well known to scavenge carcasses from lions but will also actively hunt prey as big as zebras.5 Spotted hyenas are not known to eat herbage. Hunting, human encroachment, and vehicular trauma contribute to declining populations across their range. Current estimates place the wild population between 27,000 and 47,000 individuals.13 The spotted hyena is occasionally exhibited in North American zoos.",

Underground burrows are frequently used for raising cubs or providing shelter during daylight hours. Territorial boundaries are marked, as in other hyenas, through anal gland secretions placed on prominent vegetation. Scent marked areas increase in density around dens and latrines. Aardwolves prefer open dry areas with short grass, especially overgrazed farmland.5 Population estimates are not available, but aardwolves are widely distributed and are thought to be common, but rarely seen animals. No significant threats to the population seem to exist, although wire snares, hunting, and human encroachment may impact local aardwolf densities.

The relatively weak hindlimbs sustain long distance loping, which is advantageous when hunting faster, but less so when hunting prey with endurance or distance scavenging. The jaws of the brown, spotted, and striped hyenas are very powerful, able to crush most long bones of large prey items. The brown hyena is also able to break ostrich (Struthio camelus) eggs, whereas the spotted hyena cannot.1 The dental formula of the hyenas is: incisors (I) 3/3, canines (C) 1/1, premolars (P) 4/3, and molars (M) 1/1,17 whereas that of the aardwolf which is uniquely adapted to an insect diet, is: I 3/3, C1/1, P 3/2-1 and M 1/1-2.13 All hyenas have four digits on the forelimbs and hindlimbs, with the exception of the aardwolf, which has five digits on the forelimbs and four on the hindlimbs. The pelage is a mix of spots, stripes, and muted shades of brown and black; long and shaggy in the aardwolf, brown (Figure 51-2\n), and striped hyenas and short and sparse in the spotted hyena (Figure 51-3\n). Scent marking is the most important form of communication among hyenas. The anal glands are highly developed and large in each species and secrete a pheromone-laced sebaceous paste on prominent vegetation. Scent marking is used to define territories, signal potential mates, and identify conspecific and contraspecific individuals.5, 17\n",

The brown hyena is a nocturnal, silent, solitary forager.15 However, large carcasses attract several hyenas. As opposed to the spotted hyena, brown hyenas generally feed singly, rather than in groups, even on larger carcasses. Individuals wait in the distance until the conspecific finishes (Wiesel, personal communication). In most instances, black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) arrive at the bait first; vocalization of larger groups of jackals may attract hyenas to the site. Jackals will commonly signal a hyena's approach by nervously looking in the direction of the hyena.",

            "text": "Camouflage, a low-profile silhouette, and absolute stillness are required for success of immobilization of hyenas. Use of advanced lighting, in the form of infrared technology, facilitates darting. Commercially available remote delivery systems work well, and dart placement is paramount to success. A well-placed dart in the neck or shoulder affords consistent success. A combination of ketamine (2\u20133 milligrams per kilogram [mg/kg]) with medetomidine (0.035\u20130.045 mg/kg) is effective within 3 minutes and causes recumbency of the animal within 7 minutes on average.22 This combination provides rapid smooth induction, good muscle relaxation, stable heart rate and rhythm, slight to moderate pytalism, and 40 to 50 minutes of stable anesthesia. Pulse oximetry trends are undetectable initially (Figure 51-4\n) but elevate to the mid-90th percentile 20 to 30 minutes after induction without supplementary oxygen,22 although supplemental oxygen is advisable, if available. Regurgitation is common upon reversal in field situations; this is likely caused by ingestion of bait just prior to immobilization. Application of a bland ophthalmic ointment protects the eyes during times of blowing sand and debris. Covering the eyes and placing plugs in the ear canal also assists in providing consistent recumbency (Figure 51-5\n). On occasion, an anesthetized hyena may require 30 to 40 mg of supplemental ketamine administered intramuscularly to facilitate completion of medical procedures. Reversal is achieved with atipamezole at five times the dose of medetomidine. Atipamezole given intramuscularly produces reliable recovery within 5 to 10 minutes. Blepharospasm, followed by purposeful movement of the head and cervical spine, is an indication of impending recovery. In general, the hyena ambulates away with mild ataxia, which rapidly resolves to normal ambulation within an additional 3 to 5 minutes. It is important to wait at least 50-60 minutes from induction, if possible, before reversal to achieve an uncomplicated, smooth recovery. It is advisable to monitor the hyena until complete recovery as black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) or other brown hyenas may injure the hyena until it is fully recovered.22 Recovery without reversal is prolonged, up to 90 minutes in undisturbed individuals.",

Canine distemper virus (CDV) has been documented in asymptomatic and symptomatic wild spotted hyenas; the symptoms were associated with an outbreak in African lions.2, 9 Animals exhibited epiphora and nasal discharge, hematochezia, ataxia, lethargy, and respiratory distress.9 Feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus, canine parvovirus or feline panleukopenia, feline immunodeficiency virus, and feline coronavirus were detected in wild spotted hyenas in the Masai Mara of Kenya over an 8-year period.11 In a serosurvey of 30 brown hyenas in Namibia from 1997 to 2010, 43% of adult hyenas were seropositive for CDV, as opposed to none of the sub-adults.25 Additional sampling for canine parvovirus, feline panleukopenia virus, rabies, Ehrlichia canis, and Neorickettsia risticii were negative in these same animals. Fecal direct flotation for ova and parasite examination of numerous stool samples collected from latrines and individual wild brown hyenas in 2011 were surprisingly scant; only one sub-adult demonstrated infection with low levels of coccidea.25 Numerous ectoparasites and endoparasites of Hyaenidae have been reported in the literature,18 and captive individuals should be screened and treated routinely for clinical parasitemia. Cardiomyopathy caused by Trypanosoma cruzi has been documented in an aardwolf.6\nDirofilaria sp. parasites have not been reported in the literature. Intraspecific aggression, resulting in traumatically induced wounds are common in hyenas and occasionally need medical care.4, 23 Hyenas are well known for ingestion of foreign bodies, so appropriate measures should be taken to prevent ingestion.1, 7 Pacing on hard substrates predispose to ulceration of digital pads,23 so appropriate substrate and proper management should be provided to prevent stereotypical behaviors leading to this condition.",
