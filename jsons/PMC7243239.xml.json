Our future, 'a better normal', could and should reflect the innovations in health driven by the COVID-19 response. Our future is not one of predictions but a series of pragmatic, evidence-based choices. The choices we face with respect to pace, proximity, preparedness, protection and equity have impacts that will be felt by patients and practices, with repercussions for clinical, business and service models.",

A determined revision of the current activity-driven clinical approach provides time to concentrate on personalised prevention advice, as well as the provision of effective, highly skilled treatment. The necessary bold clinical leadership prepared to grasp this opportunity to optimise time with patients offers a less rushed, more considered, team-based approach to oral healthcare delivery.",

In line with a diminishing risk of sustained COVID-19 transmission in the population, a stepwise resumption of oral healthcare and an iterative approach to how such care is delivered is to be anticipated. As we progress through the conditions-based transition, with the risk-assessed limitations on AGPs, we will need to support our patients in understanding the rationale behind the alternative management options and in appreciating the benefits of minimally invasive oral care (MIOC). Armed with the MIOC philosophy, with patients fully engaged in the shared decision-making, the opportunity to actively apply MIOC in the post-pandemic era brings us all a step closer to breaking the 'repeat restoration cycle'.1 The presciently titled article '\"MI\"opia or 20/20 vision?'2 published in the British Dental Journal is recommended reading, as is '\"Minimum intervention\" - MI inspiring future oral healthcare?'3",

With technology being used to minimise footfall into our hospitals, could it be exploited effectively in the oral healthcare sector? Our post-pandemic care model could be complemented with virtual oral healthcare at scale. Limitations in face-to-face care may well be surmounted with innovative augmentation of recall/review periodicity and online video communication services as an intrinsic element of engaging with patients to deliver prevention, reinforcing good oral health habits as patients stabilise ahead of any surgical intervention.",

In scoping and drawing up appointment schedules, through and beyond transition, consideration will need to be given to the oral health needs of shielded groups. Within the available capacity, access to care will need to prioritise vulnerable and marginalised groups. For those that are not regular attenders, we must sustain the urgent dental care (UDC) system and augment this with domiciliary care. In meeting this requirement, it would not be unreasonable to expect practices to contribute to sustaining a UDC network.",

The anticipated phased recovery of services may be just the vehicle for greater flexibility in commissioning and scaling up reforms to contract. The COVID-19 oral health legacy should be the realisation of Professor Jimmy Steele's 2009 vision4 of oral healthcare services melded with the clinical philosophy of MIOC into our working lives and daily routine practice.",

While we have a well-established reputation for rigorous IPC, COVID-19 reminds us that we must address both the physical safety and emotional support of our highly valued oral healthcare workforce. Without a physically and psychologically safe environment, high-quality oral healthcare is not possible. In assuring this broader sense of a safe environment, we will rebuild the confidence of the public and our patients in seeking our care, safe in the knowledge that they are protected, at all times, while in our clinics.",
