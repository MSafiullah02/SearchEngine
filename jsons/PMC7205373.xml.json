Healthcare is not immune to this cultural shift. Armed with smartphones, up to 80% of Americans have searched the internet for health-related information and up to 40% doubt a professional opinion when it conflicted with web-based findings [1, 2]. However, little is known about the source and substance of medical information on social media platforms. Even less is known about which sources are the most influential. As a response to the proliferation of these unsourced (and potentially unreliable) accounts, a growing number of physicians and professional societies have turned to social media to disseminate evidence-based information and to promote their practices.",

Indeed, an analysis of Twitter users found that influencers rival their own supports (e.g., friends) in building user trust, with 56% of users trusting the opinion of an influencer over friends [6]. While physicians and healthcare organizations would be the most ideal influencers within the healthcare social media space, building influence is intricate and time consuming. Busy physicians often do not have the time to cultivate consumer engagement, create content, network, and perform frequent maintenance.",

While other platforms, such as Facebook, are more popular overall, Instagram and Twitter were chosen for their consistent use by women of reproductive age [7]. Furthermore, since accounts and posts are likely influenced by news and events, the timeframe of 1 week was chosen to ensure all variables were collected within the same temporal window. The NYU Langone Health self-certification form from the Institutional Review Board was used to determine that the research question and design for this study did not qualify as human subjects research.

However, these factors were ultimately excluded as they are not readily accessible to the general public. It is also important to note there is no standard or accepted definition for an influencer, even within a single social media platform. Therefore, based on marketing data and the concepts of influencer tiers [9] and that the fertility webspace would be smaller than the reach of a mega-influencer, such as a celebrity, influencer status was defined as greater than 10,000 followers per Instagram account [10] or a verified check mark on Twitter account, which is a blue badge placed by Twitter administration on accounts confirmed to be of public interest legitimizing their authenticity [11]. Authenticity and public interest are not in of themselves criteria for being an influencer, but given the account holder must apply for the blue badge and it must be confirmed, it was chosen for this study as the best marker in the current publicly available metrics.",

The model utilized high or low activity (defined as > 50 posts/month on Twitter and > 10 posts/month on Instagram) as well as inclusion of the most frequent content in posts per platform (promotion, inspiration, education on Twitter; personal story, inspiration or promotion on Instagram). Figure 3 depicts the nodal tree from the CART analysis; on both platforms an account with high activity was the best predictor for classification as an influencer. Promotional content on Twitter and inspirational content on Instagram were the next best classifiers but were not the most predictive of classification. Logistic regression utilizing the same variables confirmed that only high activity per platform was significant for being an influencer (Twitter B \u2212 1.25, p < 0.002; Instagram B \u2212 1.32, p < 0.004).",

We found that the majority of accounts in the fertility-related social media landscape are patients, inspirational accounts, and/or support groups, and that these accounts were more influential than the physician, academic society, and fertility clinic accounts. Additionally, we found that the most frequent content were individual stories and inspirational posts. However, even armed with the most popular content, the majority of fertility specialists did not meet criteria for being a social media influencer. Overall, Twitter accounts did have a higher proportion of posts providing educational facts and even research articles. However, the authors of these posts were most often individual patients and less likely to be physicians. In turn, while a patient may share an interesting study article or new treatment, the interpretation of the study\u2019s findings or the new treatment\u2019s appropriate usage may be incorrectly communicated. Together, these findings provide an important message to all those in the fertility community. First, this serves as a reminder to consider the type and source of information that patients may come to us with and how this knowledge was acquired. Second, physicians should be aware of what is being discussed within the fertility webspace to engage with our patients on these topics to ultimately strengthen physician-patient relationships. Finally, we hope these findings engage all board-certified or eligible REI physicians providing information in this space to ensure reliable and correct messaging regarding fertility care, research, and treatment to empower patients to make self-informed decisions.",

            "text": "The topic of social media and influence in medicine has been discussed in other domains of healthcare. A review of the literature shows many fields, ranging from epilepsy, cardiovascular medicine, and plastic surgery as well as pathology [12\u201315], have investigated this area and come to varying conclusions on efficacy and implications. A review of published literature on social media in healthcare by Gupta et al. found 139 articles and abstracts and reviewed 26 of these publications from Plastic Surgery publications [15]. The authors concluded that the while social media can be beneficial, the role of an influencer in medicine must be delicately balanced within the ethics of medicine, and this balance has not yet been fully addressed in terms of best practices [15]. An analysis of the use of social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Doximity) and their associated use within academic Pathology programs showed high utilization with opportunities for networking and employment but had similar cautions of potential patient privacy issues. For example, when sharing relevant stories or images, one must ensure informed consent has been obtained [14]. However, other fields, for example Cardiovascular Medicine, continue to highlight the potential and perspective social media can offer, with worldwide instantaneous communication to perhaps educate patients prior to their office visits, and present a vision for best practice and the future of medicine as it grows with social media [13]. While the platforms and landscape may change, digital connectivity and social media is likely here to stay. Physicians may be able to benefit from practice in this space to improve communication with patients and dispel inaccurate information dispersed by others within social media. In particular, given the perpetual \u201cyouth\u201d of those presenting to fertility clinics, and that these cohorts are often avid consumers of new technology, staying connected and competent within social media will likely be paramount for the modern fertility physician.",

            "text": "Our study has three important implications. First, it shows that fertility and infertility are a highly active area of social media. In our opinion, this activity level will continue to evolve and expand and, therefore, it may behoove REI physicians not only to participate in this space but also to establish themselves as effective and trustworthy communicators with their patients who are, most likely, already utilizing social media. Second, armed with this information, we believe that REI physicians can be proactive and creative to gain more influential status. Many of the accounts included in this study were extremely active and collaborative with their platforms, but perhaps there are better, more effectual ways we can guide our efforts to obtain wider or more \u201cinfluential\u201d platforms. Finally, we believe that our results show that REI physicians can be \u201csmarter\u201d about managing their posts. One of the great aspects of social media is that each platform allows people to frame their own experiences however they so choose. In fact, the recently launched professional society, Association for Healthcare Social Media or AHSM, was created specifically for the use of social media by health care professionals with the goal of \u201cpositively influencing public health and health care through social media\u201d [16]. If physicians, REI included, could combine education with patient stories or inspirational content on a more frequent basis, our collective voice as healthcare influencers could be much more powerful and possibly, as suggested, provide a boost for dissemination of publication and academic promotion [17].",

However, our study has several limitations. Due to the nature of the study design, our data only represents a static moment in time and therefore does not characterize the dynamics of social media. Additionally, our study does not consider the evolution of an individual account over time or which accounts may be \u201cbecoming\u201d influential. This temporal bias is further highlighted with the restriction to 5 posts reviewed per account. We acknowledge that inclusion of all posts for each accounts would be a better representation of each account; however, this was simply not feasible in the design of the study. The nature of social media and its fast-paced and constantly changing nature make capturing these variables difficult.",

It is possible that the content and \u201cinfluential\u201d factors from these private accounts differ significantly from those with public access. However, we hypothesize that these accounts, while likely extremely active, have a similar post content and frequency. Second, the search function for Instagram only queries the handle and the first line of the user biography. Therefore, many users who had bios with included search terms but not in the \u201csearchable\u201d area were also excluded. This is an important limitation. However, we argue that this is how a novice user on the platform would be using the interface and may be the best representation of the most accessed accounts. It could also be an important point to all future social media users on how to be \u201cbest searched.\u201d The methodology for verifying REI-BC certification was not able to verify individuals that are REI board eligible such as REI Fellows or recent graduates prior to the certifying exam. However, no such individuals were identified by the search methodology for this study, and thus, this limitation was not encountered. Nonetheless, we recognize the limitation remain that the content and influencer information from these private and \u201cunsearched\u201d accounts were not included in our study. Finally, we recognize that there are metrics other than the number of followers that play into social media influence, such as reach and engagement. However, these metrics are not publicly available, whereas follower number is. Thus, our methodology was restricted by the nature of publicly available metrics, yet still represents the organic user experience.",
