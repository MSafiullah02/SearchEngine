Influenza is classified into three distinct subtypes based on antigenic differences: influenza A, influenza B and influenza C. Influenza A infects a range of species (humans, swine, equine, avian, marine mammals) and is responsible for large pandemics, whereas influenza B and C are generally restricted to human species. Viral nomenclature has been standardized and consists of influenza type, place of initial isolation, strain and year of isolation (e.g. A/HK/156/97) (1, 3).",

Two of the most important gene products are the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA is produced by RNA segment 4 and is responsible for host\u2010cell membrane attachment and membrane fusion. The NA is produced by RNA segment 5 and cleaves sialic acid from the cell surface, thereby allowing for cleavage of viral progeny from infected cell surfaces. There are at least 15 antigenically distinct HA types that have been described in influenza A (H1\u2013H15) and at least 9 NA (N1\u2013N9) types. The majority of human diseases are caused by only a few HA (H1, H2, H3) and NA (N1, N2) subtypes.",

This may be secondary to activation of immunological mechanisms, including the upregulation of pro\u2010inflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20106 and IL\u20108 (2). Some studies of kidney and liver recipients have reported a high incidence of acute rejection following infection with influenza (4, 5). However, while associations between influenza infection and rejection have been reported, a causal relationship has yet to be established. The most suggestive data is in lung transplant recipients, in whom community\u2010acquired respiratory viruses have been implicated as triggers for acute rejection and for the development of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) (7). In a prospective study of 50 lung transplant patients with community\u2010acquired respiratory virus infections, a higher incidence of acute rejection and BOS was observed when compared with controls without such infections (8). The overall rate of progression to viral pneumonia in these patients was 8%, but was predominantly observed in patients with influenza and para\u2010influenza but not in those with coronavirus or rhinovirus infections.",

Minor variability is referred to as antigenic drift; viruses produced by antigenic drift may have substitutions in the antibody\u2010binding site and may cause re\u2010infection and epidemics. Larger changes may occur by reassortment of the segmented genome when two influenza viruses simultaneously infect a host cell, producing a virus with new subtypes of surface proteins (9, 10). This \u2018antigenic shift\u2019 is responsible for pandemic influenza in a na\u00efve population. Pandemic influenza may also arise due to a direct mutation of an avian virus into one capable of efficient human\u2010to\u2010human transmission, as described in Figure 1 and below (9, 10).",

            "text": "In the past century, three pandemics of human influenza occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968 (Figure 2) (11). Of these, the 1918 pandemic resulted in the greatest loss of life, estimated at 40 million worldwide. Influenza virus from the last two pandemics emerged as a consequence of reassortment events between two viruses (9, 10, 11). In the 1957 pandemic, a reassortment event involving an avian H2N2 and human H1N1 viral co\u2010infection resulted in a transmissible pathogenic new human influenza virus that contained the avian HA and NA genes, and one of the avian polymerase genes. The 1968 pandemic influenza virus appears to have originated from a similar reassortment event that resulted in a transmissible H3N2 virus. Recent data show, however, that the highly virulent 1918 pandemic influenza virus (\u2018Spanish flu virus\u2019) did not arise from similar mechanisms. Taubenberger et al. (12) recovered RNA fragments from paraffin block and frozen tissue of patients who died in the 1918 pandemic. By assembling and characterizing the sequences of the eight gene segments from this virus, they have shown that the 1918 highly virulent pandemic virus was an H1N1 virus, in which all eight genes appear to be of avian origin. This data suggests that the 1918 virus resulted from cross\u2010species infection from an avian species to humans, with subsequent adaptation of this avian virus to allow for efficient human\u2010to\u2010human spread. Remarkably, only a 10\u2010amino acid difference was found between the polymerase proteins and the avian influenza consensus sequence. Tumpey et al. (13) used reverse genetics to reconstruct the virus and demonstrated that the 1918 virus is 100 times as lethal in mice as any other human influenza virus.",

Another important difference is the increasing numbers of people with compromised immune systems. This includes organ and stem cell transplant patients, and those with other forms of immune compromise, resulting in yet another unknown variable in the pandemic influenza story.

All 15 HA and 9 NA subtypes are maintained in the aquatic bird population, where viral replication occurs in the gastrointestinal tract and virus is shed in feces at high titers (11, 14). Although a number of avian influenza viruses have been responsible for occasional human disease, the current outbreak of H5N1 is most concerning in terms of its pandemic potential (15). H5N1 was first recognized as a cause of human disease in Hong Kong in 1997, in connection with a poultry outbreak in live\u2010bird markets (16). A total of 18 human cases occurred with a 33% mortality. After a quiet period, the virus re\u2010emerged in 2003 (17). Since then, the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus has caused unprecedented outbreaks in poultry stocks throughout Asia (18). These outbreaks are in fact the largest and most severe outbreaks in domestic poultry in recorded history. In addition, the detection of virus in migratory birds (19), and the recent spread of the virus to Europe suggest that migratory birds are directly spreading highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. The outbreak of avian influenza (H5N1) through South East Asia and its progressive spread westward have resulted in increasing concern about the threat of a new worldwide influenza pandemic (15). In fact, the WHO has warned that we are now closer to a global pandemic than at any other time since the 1968 pandemic (Figure 2).",

The disease in humans seems to have an unusually aggressive clinical course with rapid deterioration, primary viral pneumonia and multi\u2010organ failure (17, 21, 22). Case fatality has been high (95/175 patients or approximately 54%), often despite the initiation of early therapy. Most cases have occurred in previously healthy children and young adults (17). It has been suggested that an exuberant host pro\u2010inflammatory response may contribute to excessive tissue injury (23). Recent population\u2010based analyses in rural Vietnam have suggested that milder forms of avian influenza may be common, although this needs to be confirmed with seroprevalence studies (24).",

Eventually, H5N1 may undergo sufficient genetic changes to allow efficient human\u2010to\u2010human transmission, resulting in the next influenza pandemic (9, 10, 15). In fact, the H5N1 virus has undergone antigenic changes (drift) since it first emerged in 1997. Specifically, changes to the HA have been shown by sequencing and antigenic characterization of recent isolates as compared to earlier isolates (25). This may represent the process of adaptation of the virus to the human host. The virus also appears to have expanded its host range to other mammals including domestic cats (26). All that appears necessary for the next pandemic is a genetic change sufficient to allow for easy human\u2010to\u2010human transmission.",

For example, during the SARS outbreak in Toronto, closure of the transplant program occurred due to several concerns (30). Transmission of SARS within health care facilities resulted in concerns about recipient (or living donor) safety as a result of admission to the hospital. Finally, with any new disease outbreak, concerns about transmission of infection from donor to recipients are present. Recent cases of West Nile virus and rabies transmission highlight such concerns, but transmission is theoretically possible in the setting of a disease outbreak of avian influenza. While lung transplantation would logically be the most likely setting in which such transmission would occur, virus may be present in other organs. For avian influenza, case reports of extra\u2010pulmonary manifestations have included encephalitis and gastrointestinal symptoms (31). Experimental infection of cats with H5N1 demonstrated viral replication in multiple extra\u2010respiratory tissues (32).",

Pandemics can cause large surges in the numbers of people requiring or seeking medical or hospital treatment, temporarily overwhelming health services. The CDC predicts that a \u2018medium\u2010level epidemic\u2019 could kill up to 207 000 Americans, hospitalize 734 000, and sicken about a third of the U.S. population. This will lead to issues of resource allocation, especially given the limited number of ventilator ICU beds available at any given time. It is estimated that during an outbreak of pandemic influenza, ventilator capacity would be quickly outstripped very early in the course of the pandemic. High rates of worker absenteeism can also interrupt other essential services, such as health\u2010care delivery, law enforcement, transportation and communications. During past pandemics, attack rates reached 25\u201335% of the total population. The 1918 pandemic killed at least 40 million people. In the United States, the mortality rate during that pandemic was around 2.5%. Overall, it would be unlikely that a transplant program could remain active even in a limited capacity during the midst of an influenza pandemic. This would mean that in addition to those dying directly due to influenza, loss of life would occur in potential organ recipients who are unable to receive life\u2010saving transplant procedures.",

The vaccine is produced from virus grown in embryonated hens' eggs, and contains 15 \u03bcg each of two circulating strains of influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2) and 15 \u03bcg of an influenza B strain. Vaccines elicit a strain\u2010specific response and have reduced efficacy against viruses that have undergone antigenic drift and are ineffective against those that have undergone antigenic shift. Increases in antibody titer are seen in approximately 90% of healthy adults who receive vaccine (1). However, the immunogenicity of this vaccine in patients on exogenous immunosuppression is questionable. Although somewhat conflicting, data from several studies show that neutralizing antibody response is suboptimal and ranges from 15\u201386% (34, 35, 36, 37). Indeed, influenza may occur despite vaccination in organ transplant recipients (23). One study showed that two doses of influenza vaccine increased immunogenicity from 68% to greater than 80%, although this data was uncontrolled (38). A live attenuated vaccine has been shown to have similar immunogenicity as the inactivated vaccine in young immunocompetent adults (39). This has not been evaluated in transplant recipients primarily, since live vaccines have generally been contraindicated in transplant recipients due to their ability to cause severe disease. There is also no convincing data to suggest that vaccination plays a role in organ dysfunction or is a trigger for rejection (36, 40).",

Mammalian cell lines have been used to culture influenza for vaccines, but due to their high pathogenicity, work with these virus subtypes requires a high level of biocontainment and safety (41). Various strategies to overcome these limitations are being assessed, such as the use of baculovirus\u2010expressed HA, or using reverse genetic systems to generate reassortant strains (41, 42). However, conventional surface antigen vaccine candidates have been found to be poorly immunogenic in clinical studies, and use of whole virus or adjuvants may be necessary (41).

However, the effectiveness of these drugs is limited due to emerging resistance. The H5N1 strains from South East Asia have mutations in the M2 gene that confer drug\u2010resistance (43). The NA inhibitors, zanamivir (inhaled) and oseltamivir (oral) have similar efficacy for prevention of influenza A, including strains that are resistant to amantadine. These drugs work via specific and potent inhibition of influenza NA enzyme activity, which is responsible for cleavage of sialic acid residues and release of viral progeny from infected cells (44). These drugs appear to be safe in transplant recipients and do not appear to interact with commonly used immunosuppressive medications. Retrospective data in transplant populations (primarily HSCT patients) have shown that these drugs are likely effective in reducing progression to viral pneumonia, reducing viral shedding and reducing mortality (although emergence of resistance during therapy has been reported) (2, 4, 45).",
