            "text": "The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) calls for and welcomes possible treatment strategies using drugs on the market. It is very efficient to apply computer-aided drug design techniques to quickly identify promising drug repurposing candidates, especially after the detailed 3D structures of key viral proteins are resolved. The virus causing COVID-19 is SARS-CoV-2. Taking advantage of a recently released crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease in complex with a covalently bonded inhibitor, N3 (Liu et al., 10.2210/pdb6LU7/pdb), I conducted virtual docking screening of approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical trials. For the top docking hits, I then performed molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using an end point method called MM-PBSA-WSAS (molecular mechanics/Poisson\u2212Boltzmann surface area/weighted solvent-accessible surface area; Wang, et al. Chem. Rev. 2019, 119, 9478; Wang, et al. Curr. Comput.-Aided Drug Des. 2006, 2, 287; Wang; Hou J. Chem. Inf. Model. , 2012, 52, 1199). Several promising known drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease, including carfilzomib, eravacycline, valrubicin, lopinavir, and elbasvir. Carfilzomib, an approved anticancer drug acting as a proteasome inhibitor, has the best MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy, \u221213.8 kcal/mol. The second-best repurposing drug candidate, eravacycline, is synthetic halogenated tetracycline class antibiotic. Streptomycin, another antibiotic and a charged molecule, also demonstrates some inhibitory effect, even though the predicted binding free energy of the charged form (\u22123.8 kcal/mol) is not nearly as low as that of the neutral form (\u22127.9 kcal/mol). One bioactive, PubChem 23727975, has a binding free energy of \u221212.9 kcal/mol. Detailed receptor\u2212ligand interactions were analyzed and hot spots for the receptor\u2212ligand binding were identified. I found that one hot spot residue, His41, is a conserved residue across many viruses including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The findings of this study can facilitate rational drug design targeting the SARS-CoV-2 main protease.",

            "text": "A great application of drug repurposing is to identify drugs that were developed for treating other diseases to treat a new disease. Drug repurposing can be achieved by conducting systematic drug\u2212drug target interaction (DTI) and drug\u2212drug interaction (DDI) analyses. We have conducted a survey on DTIs collected by the DrugBank database 5 and found that on average each drug has 3 drug targets and each drug target has 4.7 drugs. 6 The analysis demonstrates that polypharmacology is a common phenomenon. It is important to identify potential DTIs for both approved drugs and drug candidates, which serves as the basis of repurposing drugs and selection of drug targets without DTIs that may cause side effects. Polypharmacology opens novel avenues to rationally design the next generation of more effective but less toxic therapeutic agents. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) has been playing essential roles in modern drug discovery and development. To balance the computational efficiency and accuracy, a hierarchical strategy employing different types of scoring functions are applied in both the drug lead identification and optimization phases. A docking scoring function, such as the one employed by the Glide docking program, 7 is very efficient and thus can be utilized to screen a large library, but it is not very accurate. On the other hand, the molecular mechanical force field (MMFF)-based scoring functions are physical and more accurate but much less efficient. With the ever increasing computer power, MMFF-based free energy calculation methods, such as the end point MM-PBSA (molecular mechanics Poisson\u2212Boltzmann surface area) and MM-GBSA (molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area) methods 2,3,8\u221221 and the alchemical thermodynamic integration (TI) and free energy perturbation (FEP) methods, 22, 23 have been extensively applied in structure-based drug discovery projects. We have developed a hierarchical virtual screening (HVS) to balance the efficiency and accuracy and improve the success rate of rational drug design. 8, 24 The newly released crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease 1 provides a solid structural basis for identification of drugs that might interact with this protein target. In this work, I applied multiscale modeling techniques to identify drugs that may be repurposed to target SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Flexible docking and MM-PBSA-weighted solvent-accessible surface area (WSAS) were applied as the first and second filters, respectively, to improve the efficiency and accuracy of HVS in inhibitor identification for SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Compared to the experimental means, CADD-based approaches are more efficient in providing possible treatment solutions for epidemic disease outbreaks like COVID-19. The detailed ligand\u2212residue interaction profile, as well as the decomposition of binding free energy into different components, provides insight into rationally designing potent and selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease.",

            "text": "2.1. Docking Screening. The crystal structure was first treated using the protein structure preparation wizard provided by the Schrodinger software, followed by docking grid generation. Glide flexible docking was performed using the default settings except that the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds was rewarded and the enhancement of planarity of conjugated \u03c0 groups was turned on. The cocrystal ligand, N3, was covalently bonded to Cys145. I generated a new version of N3, N3\u2032, by breaking the covalent bond and filling in open valence. I then evaluated whether Glide flexible docking can reproduce the native binding pose. In addition, a data set of approved drugs was prepared using DrugBank, 5 and a set of PubChem compounds that are structurally similar to lopinavir were enriched for docking screenings. Lopinavir, a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 protease, 26 was found to be effective in treating COVID-19 patients. Top hits from the docking screenings were advanced to the next HVS filter, MM-PBSA-WSAS. The 3D-structures of the screening compounds were generated using the OpenBabel software. 27 2.2. System Setup for Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation and Free Energy Calculation. MD simulations were first performed for a docking hit for two purposes: (1) studying the relative stability of the ligand residing in the binding pocket; (2) sampling a set of conformations for MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy calculations and MM-GBSA residue\u2212ligand binding free energy decomposition analysis. A MD system consisted of one copy of SARS-CoV-2 main protease, one copy of docked ligand, 17597 TIP3P 28 water molecules, and about 50 Na + and Cl \u2212 ions depending on the charge state of the ligand. The whole system was neutralized. For the force field parameters, the partial atomic charges of ligands were derived using the RESP 29 program to fit the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potentials generated using the Gaussian 16 software package. 30 The other force field parameters of ligands come from GAFF, 31 and the AMBER FF14SB 32 force field was employed to model the viral protein. The residue topologies for ligands were prepared using the Antechamber module 33 implemented in the AMBER software package. 34 For the covalently bonded N3 ligand, I applied the residuegen program to generate nonstandard amino acid residue topology.",

The least-squares (LS) fitted RMSDs of the ligands (green curves) are around 2 \u00c5, which is reasonable for large ligands like SARS-CoV-2 main protease inhibitors. A ligand's no-fit RMSD was calculated by first performing LSfitting for the main chain atoms of the receptor, and the resulting translation\u2212rotation matrix was applied to the ligand, and then the RMSD was calculated directly. Evidently, the ligand no-fit RMSD measures not only the conformational changes but also its translational and rotational movements inside the binding pocket. The ligand no-fit RMSDs (blue curves) are larger than the LS-fit values; however, those values around 3\u22124 \u00c5 are still acceptable for large ligands. It is pointed out that sometimes the LS-fit and no-fit RMSD values are overestimated due to rotation of symmetrical functional groups of a ligand.

The comparisons between the crystal structure and the representative MD conformations are shown in Figure 5 for the native ligand N3 and in Figures 6\u22128 for the other ligands. As shown in Figure 5 , the benzene motif located in the dashed red cycle was inserted between two hot spot residues (His41 and Met49) for the MD structure, which is quite distinct from the crystal structure, which shows that the benzene motif has no direct interactions with His41 and Met49. I believe that under physiological conditions, the benzene motif becomes less solvent exposed and has more favorable interactions with His41 and Met49 by inserting itself between the side chains of the two residues. It is known that histidine has versatile roles in protein interactions. 43 After the sulfide bond is formed as a result of nucleophilic attack on catalytic Cys145 by the N3 ligand, His41 can stabilize the ligand\u2212protein interaction by forming \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 stacking interactions between the His41 and the benzene motif of N3.

            "text": "The outbreak of highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19 demands identification of multiple treatment plans as soon as possible. Computational drug repurposing studies can provide treatment options in a short period of time. For this study, amounts of computational time used for individual tasks are as follows. Docking screenings of all 2201 approved drugs with a single CPU core (Intel Xeon CPU E5-2683) took 11 h. For each docking hit, we need to perform ab initio calculations to derive point charges. The ab initio calculation using wB97XD/6-31G*//HF/6-31G* consumed about 1 day using four CPU cores; then it took us about 1.2 days to sample 120 ns using one GTX-1080 ti GPU; the following MM-PBSA-WSAS calculation consumed 1 day. Therefore, equipped with sufficient numbers of CPUs and GPUs and the current hardware, we can finish the drug repurposing screenings within 4 to 5 days using a reliable HVS strategy. Given that the inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease have relatively large sizes, the screening time can be even shorter for other drug targets with smaller ligands. Another consideration is the availability of high-quality drug target structures. Luckily, a high-resolution crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 protease in complex with a ligand was resolved quickly, allowing us to conduct this drug repurposing screening. If no high-quality structure is available, one can rely on homology modeling techniques, probably with a reduced success rate of identifying repurposing drugs. Take SARS-CoV-2 main protease as an example: I performed structural alignments using an internal program that takes a multiplesequence-alignment (MSA) as an input. The MSA was generated by using the Promals3D web server. 45 The structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease is found to be most similar to those of SARS-CoV protease (PDB 3TNT 46 ) and less similar to MERS-CoV protease (PDB 5WKK 47 ) ( Figure 9A ). In comparison, the structure of hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3/4A (PDB code 3M5L 48 ) is quite different from the main proteases of coronaviruses: the RMSD of 2.26 \u00c5 between HCV and SARS-CoV-2 is much larger and with only 108 residues participating the least-squares fitting ( Figure 9B ). I also compared the sequences of the four proteases around the seven hot spot residues, which are colored in red in Table 3 . It is shown that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share all seven hot spot residues. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have four of the seven hot spot residues in common, while HCV NS3/4A and SARS-CoV-2 have only one hot spot residue (His41) in common. Even though the sequence identity is low between SARS-CoV-2 main protease and HCV NS3/4A, as shown in Figure 9B , the cocrystal ligands, N3 (green sticks) for SARS-CoV-2 and ITMN-191 (brown sticks) for HCV NS3/4A, largely overlap. This suggests that homology models can be constructed using Modeller 49 with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and even HCV NS3/4A as templates.",

MM-PBSA-WSAS Binding Free Energy Calculations. I measured the ligand binding affinity using the end point MM-PBSA method. Considering that the ligands of SARS-CoV-2 main protease are flexible molecules with large sizes, the contribution of the binding free energy from the conformational entropy change due to protein\u2212ligand binding cannot be neglected. Instead of applying normal-mode analysis to estimate the entropic effect, I applied an efficient method called WSAS 4 to calculate this energy term. This scoring function is therefore called MM-PBSA-WSAS. The calculated binding free energies and the Glide docking scores are summarized in",
