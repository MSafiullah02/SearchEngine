The NAHLN is a cooperative effort between the USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians. It is comprised of laboratories that provide diagnostic services for different diseases, using common testing methods and software platforms to process diagnostic requests and share information. Results of laboratory accessions tested at NAHLN laboratories for PEDV were voluntarily sent weekly to APHIS for compilation and reporting purposes. In April 2014, similar reporting for PDCoV was initiated and eventually combined with the PEDV report. From March 30, 2014 to July 9, 2015, 733 positive laboratory accessions for PDCoV were reported from 17 States (USDA, APHIS, website, 2015). A positive accession does not necessarily represent a single positive herd as multiple accessions may be submitted from a single herd. In June 2014, the USDA published a Federal Order mandating the reporting of PEDV and PDCoV by producers, veterinarians and laboratories. The Federal Order required the inclusion of premises identifier data to allow for more accurate monitoring of disease incidence and spread. From June 2014 to July 9, 2015, 70 premises in 13 States have been confirmed with PDCoV (USDA, APHIS, website, 2015).",

Up to 50 cases per month per lab and up to 2 samples per case could be included. Samples from the same case could be pooled in groups of 5. Samples were tested from each month in the date range and from as wide a geographic distribution as possible. Each sample result was to be accompanied by the date of sample collection, State in which the farm submitting samples was located, operation type (sow/boar, nursery, suckling, and grower/finisher) and, the results of any previous diagnostic testing. Data from the three laboratories was combined and the FREQ procedure in SAS used to determine relative frequencies.",

The questionnaire was unusual in that it asked cross sectional questions at the operation level (e.g., inventory) as well as animal and time level (e.g., number of suckling pigs with clinical signs in the first week of the PDCoV outbreak). There was room in the questionnaire for identification of only two types of ill pigs. When there were more than two types of pigs ill on the operation that observation was split. This resulted in additional rows of data being created using the original farm identification number. Operation level information was replicated in the second row but animal information differed to reflect the third or more ill animal type. This resulted in 56 observations in the final edited dataset rather than the original 42. For subsequent operation level estimations such as average inventory, only one observation was used and identified as operation type. Estimates of morbidity, case fatality, and clinical signs were included and identified as ill pig type. SUDAAN (http://www.rti.org/suddan) was used to complete the statistical estimation due to its ability to estimate standard error automatically.",

Most operations, independent of operation type, experienced PEDV infection before PDCoV infection. Participants were asked if changes to biosecurity protocols were made in response to either this operation becoming infected with PEDV or concerns about PEDV in general (Table 4, Table 5\n). Specific changes to protocols of personnel entering the pig facilities due to prior PEDV infection included applying disinfectant to the entry mat, requiring hand sanitizer, placing lunches in double bags, requiring use of rubber boots, prohibiting cell phones from entering pig facilities, requiring disposable boots and foot baths, requiring semen deliveries be made off site, and changing down time for employees from 48 to 72 h. Responses for changes to protocols for trucks, equipment and drivers due to prior PEDV infection included biosecurity reviews, delivery and pickup route changes, increased down time for trucks, and requiring trucks to always be washed and disinfected and dried for 24 h and in some cases heated. Responses for changes to feeding practices included changing premix vendors, flushing feed lines after mixing diets that contained porcine products, and eliminating all or some porcine products from the feed (e.g porcine sprayed dried plasma).",

Samples testing PDCoV PCR positive in August and October of 2013 indicates that PDCoV was present at least 3\u20136 months prior to the reports of clinical outbreaks on farms. It has been suggested that the PDCoV, similar to other enteric coronaviruses in swine, does not survive well in warmer temperatures. The earliest detections in August and October may not have propagated or spread rapidly across the US due to warm summer and fall temperatures.",

Thachil et al. (2015) described a new ELISA test for PDCoV and following retrospective serological testing of 395 banked samples submitted for gastrointestinal disease with this ELISA suggested that PDCoV has been present in the US since 2010. The results from this serologic testing are based on an estimated test specificity of 95%, based on a negative population cohort of 30 animals.

There has not been a separate effort to update this research for PDCoV. Most sites had multiple deliveries of feed, company service person visits, and renderer entry. Most also had pigs picked up for some reason such as permanent removal to an abattoir. Lowe et al. (2014) described how this stream is a concern since the prevalence of PEDV in vehicles leaving a harvest facility appeared to increase as the prevalence of contaminated trucks came into the facility. It is fortunate that sites in the study changed truck protocol to include trailer heating based on the work of Thomas et al. (2013). Other researchers suggest that the transportation of dead animals (e.g., rendering) inherently has a high risk for transmission of PEDV and probably PDCoV (Henry, 2014).",
