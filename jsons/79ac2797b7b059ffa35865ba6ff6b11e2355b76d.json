A range of antigen detection systems are available, varying in sensitivity, complexity, and expense, and each may have a role to play depending upon the laboratory setting. Technical advancements to eliminate false-positive results in solid-phase IgM assays have provided an awareness of very early IgM responses in diseases such as rubella, hepatitis A, and mumps. When clinical specimens contain large numbers of virus particles, a rapid diagnosis is easily made using electron microscopy. Detection of antigens, virus particles, and IgM responses is creating increased demands for viral diagnostic services in primary care settings. Other approaches using sensitive probes for viral nucleic acids or enzymes will also serve as viable laboratory techniques in the future.",

            "text": "summarizes several reported techniques for the detection of viral antigens. Gel diffusion, rheophoresis, and immunoelectrophoresis (IEOP) employ gels in which antigen and antibody move toward each other, resulting in a line of precipitation. Thin-layer immunoassay (TIA) involves the adsorption of a thin layer of globulins onto a polystyrene surface [1, 2] . This surface then has the characteristics of an immunosorbent which is able to bind antigens. The antigen/antibody interaction is visualized on the plate by exposing it to water vapor. Immune complexes are hydrophilic and the background is hydrophobic; thus differences in condensation patterns are easily recognizable to the naked eye. Latex agglutination (LA), indirect hemagglutination inhibition (IHI) or reverse passive hemagglutination (RPHA), and solid-phase aggregation of coated erythrocytes (SPACE) [3] are all based on the principle of coating a visible marker such as latex particles or erythrocytes with antibody. These tests are usually performed by mixing specimens with the coated surfaces and allowing time for settling. SPACE is a solid phase variant of the test (Fig. 1) . These tests are relatively rapid, sensitive, and simplistic. A commercially available LA test for rotaviruses has enabled the immediate processing of stool suspensions from children admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis during winter months when a large number of specimens are submitted to the laboratory (greater 757 than 15 per day) and routine electron microscopy (EM) becomes cumbersome. The LA test usually allows rapid identification of more than half of the infections and the negatives can be examined for other agents by EM.",

Specimens, after fixation, are stable and can be dispatched without time limitations because infectivity is not a factor. The test may be performed by a direct method in which antiviral antibody carries the fluorescent label, or an indirect method where an unconjugated antiviral antibody is detected by a labeled anti-species antibody. Either or both techniques may be used, depending upon the diagnostic situation. For example, if only one antigen is being sought, a direct method might be a better choice (i.e., herpes encephalitis) (Fig. 2 ). This patient, as well as several others, have yielded a positive identification of herpes simplex virus (HSV) antigens in brain biopsy before the administration of antiviral chemotherapy. Investigation of a patient with respiratory infection when several respiratory viruses may be circulating in the community would require the use of an indirect technique employing several an- (Fig. 3 ). The technique is dependent upon highly specific reagents, a fluorescent microscope, and a certain amount of expertise and patience. Its value has been demonstrated for the diagnosis of respiratory infections on admision to our pediatric wards but success is dependent upon collection of appropriate nasopharyngeal specimens containing infected cells. Radioimmunoassay (RIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are based on similar principles employing a solid phase coated with a capture antibody (CA) against a specific virus. Like IF microscopy, direct or indirect techniques have been developed [7, 8] . RIA employs radioactively labeled anti-sera (i.e., iodine) and a gamma counter is necessary to read the results. The ELISA technique employs an enzyme attached to an indicator antibody (IA) which causes a color change when the appropriate substrate is added. This technique may be read by the naked eye or in a spectrophotometer, depending upon the quality and quantity of analysis that is required.",

            "text": "Solid-phase immunoassays (RIA and ELISA) are the most sensitive techniques available for the detection of antigens in clinical specimens. Their optimal use for rapid viral diagnosis appears to be in a situation where several specimens might be examined for an antigen in a given run. Most techniques require a day or overnight incubation to perform the test. Most of these techniques employ one of the three methods shown in Fig. 4 : (1) competitive, (2) direct, or (3) indirect. In the competitive assay [9] , enzyme-labeled antigen is mixed with the test sample containing antigen, which competes for a limited amount of antibody attached to the solid phase. Unbound antigen is washed away and the difference in indicator activity between the specimen and the control is compared. In a direct assay the clinical specimen is added to a solid phase which has a CA attached to it. Unbound antigen is washed away before the addition of conjugated detector antibody (DA). The indirect test is similar to the direct assay employing a CA and DA, but the DA is not conjugated. Instead, a third conjugated IA, which is anti-species to DA, is used. This approach has become popular for ELISA because of the availability of IA enzyme conjugates from commercial sources. A number of solid phases have been used, including test tubes, microtiter plates, beads, filter paper discs, and resins. The type of solid phase will dictate the kinds of instrumentation to be used in manipulation of the various steps in the procedure. Immunoassays have been successfully applied for the detection of hepatitis A virus (HAV) [10] , hepatitis B virus (HBV) [11] , rotavirus [12, 13] , adenovirus [14, 15] , herpes simplex virus (HSV) [16, 17] , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [18] , influenza A virus [19, 20, 21] , cytomegalovirus (CMV) [22] , and Coxsackie viruses [23, 24] , and commercial kits are becoming available for several. Table 2 shows a small comparison of the ability of EIA and electron microscopy (EM) to detect rotavirus in stools from patients with gastroenteritis. Thus we have used EIA for rotavirus antigen detection in clinical specimens to facilitate processing large numbers of specimens as cited above employing LA.",

Using polyclonal CA and group-and type-specific monoclonal antibodies to HSV as detector reagents, we were able to establish cutoff values (.05 or .025) in an ELISA test which identified a virus isolate as HSV (Fig. 5 ). By constructing optical density ratios with the reactions to the two monoclonals ( Fig. 6 ) all isolates falling above 1.5 were type 1 and below were type 2. In a comparison with an IF technique and restriction endonuclease analysis the ELISA test was 100 percent sensitive and specific for identification and typing (Table 3 ). Thus this methodology enables us to obtain a more rapid diagnosis when needed by assaying infected cell culture fluids after 24 hours' incubation and providing virus typing at the same time.",

Density gradient centrifugation and column chromatography are probably the most accurate means available for the separation of IgM. However, these techniques are relatively complex, time-consuming, and expensive to perform. Consequently not many laboratories would employ them on a routine basis. Absorption of the serum with a preparation of staphylococcal protein A (SPA) has been used with varying success for the detection of rubella-specific IgM in order to diagnose recent infection [25] . Similarly, 2-mercaptoethanol has been used to destroy IgM in sera. A comparison is then made of treated and non-treated sera for the measurement of antibody responses. Both of these techniques, although easy to perform, have their problems with specificity of reaction. The products of separation in any of these methods are usually assayed in standard tests such as hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), RIA, ELISA, and so on.",

            "text": "There is a trend toward the development of assays which will separate and measure in the same test (Table 5 ). IF was one of the earliest approaches to IgM measurement using infected cells to trap IgM from serum [26] [27] [28] [29] . This approach has the difficulties of creating a uniform expression of antigens and elimination of adsorption of immunoglobulins to Fc receptors expressed on the surface of virusinfected cells. Thus more recent approaches use inanimate solid phases (see section on antigen detection) and indicators conjugated with isotopes, enzymes, erythrocytes, or latex particles. Figure 7 illustrates the principles of IgM measurement using a capture antigen on the solid phase. The antigen may be adsorbed directly or stuck to the solid phase with immunoglobulin or a combination of immunoglobulin and SPA. Captured IgM is then indicated by an anti-IgM conjugate (direct test) or through an indirect method. Table 6 summarizes most of the capture antigen IgM systems that have appeared [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . Most of the publications have appeared on Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), CMV, and rubella virus. For the diagnosis of rubella, it is now possible to employ sensitive and specific IgM ELISAs on a single serum. Thus we have incorporated this test into our serological battery of tests on patients presenting with signs and symptoms compatible with rubella and on others whose serological profile contain a negative rubella PHA response and a positive hemagglutination inhibition or ELISA (IgG) response. Renal allograft patients are investigated in our laboratory for primary or reactivated BK papovavirus (BKV) infection by testing serum for BKV IgM antibody using a capture antigen RIA. Figure 8 illustrates specific IgM detection employing antibody to IgM on the solid phase. This captures all IgM from the serum, but the specific viral IgM can be targeted by the subsequent addition of viral antigen. The presence of trapped antigen is then indicated (direct or indirect) by a conjugate. If the viral antigen has the ability to hemagglutinate, erythrocytes can be used as indicators. Table 7 summarizes the various capture antibody systems that have been described [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] . A majority of the papers have appeared since 1978, and most are in the area of rubella serology. Tests for hepatitis A and rubella IgM have found their way into routine use due to commercial efforts. Figure 9 shows a modification of the capture antibody method employing an enzyme-labeled antigen [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . The technique has been described for CMV, EBV, VZV, and HSV (Table 8 ) and appears to have the advantages of simplicity as well as high levels of sensitivity and specificity. Another approach that has been described is shown in Fig. 10 . This competitive antibody blocking test passively adsorbs the test serum to the solid phase then blocks reactive sites in one of the wells before adding antigen and indicator. Differences are then indicative of IgM presence or absence.",

A single serum collected during the acute phase of illness can be tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HAV IgM. The presence of either of these markers thus provides a diagnosis within a day. The presence of core antibody (anti-HBc) and absence of anti-HBs (antibody to surface antigen) may mean recent infection with HBV, and a second serum should be requested or a test performed on the first serum for anti-HBc IgM. By the process of elimination of HBV, HAV, CMV, and EBV the patient may be diagnosed as having non-A, non-B hepatitis. Assays for detection of markers of non-A, non-B may soon become available [74] . Using the tests illustrated in Fig. 11 we have had many occasions to perform \"stat\" testing on health care workers' and patients' sera involved in a needlestick accident and to provide recommendations for the appropriate use of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). Similar testing has identified HBsAg mothers and recommendations for the use of HBIG and vaccine for their babies. Identification of HAV cases have enabled appropriate immunization of their close contacts with immune serum globulin. DETECTION OF VIRAL PARTICLES Electron microscopy (EM) techniques are most applicable for the investigation of infections when virus may be present in specimens in concentrations of at least 107 particles per ml [75] . Specimens such as feces, vesicle fluid, brain tissue, wart tissue, urine, or serum can be negatively stained with minimum preparation to yield positive results.",
