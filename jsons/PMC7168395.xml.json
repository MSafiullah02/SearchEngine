The presence of this virus was recently described in Dutch children and tentatively called human metapneumovirus (hMPV).\n1\n Clinical symptoms of infection are reported to resemble those of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) infection. We therefore investigated whether the virus was present in Australian children.",

All NPA specimens were initially negative for hRSV, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 and adenovirus by direct fluorescent antigen testing and subsequent viral culture. These negative NPA specimens were then screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for hMPV, based on the known sequence of the virus.\n2\n Sequencing of the PCR product in all three positive samples was 100% homologous with the known hMPV sequence. Viral growth was subsequently detected in culture from two of these samples, and confirmed as hMPV, using the method of van den Hoogen et al.\n1\n Co\u2010existent infection with coronavirus, rhinovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae was excluded by PCR screening of the three hMPV isolates using validated in\u2010house methods based on established protocols. Clinical features of the infected children are summarised in the Box.",

Only 25%\u201333% of NPA specimens collected from our population with suspected respiratory tract disease yield a positive result for a known viral or bacterial pathogen.
