COVID-19 spread rapidly from China, reaching a pandemic and putting the world on alert. SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in 211 countries, areas or territories, and >1,200,000 cases have been confirmed, with an estimated mortality risk of ~5.5% (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). In India, ~5000 patients were confirmed with SARS-CoV-2, with an estimated mortality risk of ~2.5% and an escalating incidence rate increasing daily. Unfortunately, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19 at this time, and current management includes travel restrictions, patient isolation, and supportive medical care. However, scientists are endeavoring to discover drugs and vaccines for COVID-19, but a better understanding of the underlying pathobiology is required.",

In a case series of 21 patients with COVID-19, congestive heart failure was the second most common baseline comorbidity (42.9%) [3]. A new study reported that COVID-19 can cause heart injury, even in people without underlying heart issues [2]. However, while the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are dominated by respiratory symptoms, cardiovascular involvement can occur through several other mechanisms [4]. Acute cardiac injury is the most frequently reported cardiovascular abnormality in COVID-19, and it occurs in ~8\u201312% of all patients [5]. The presence of underlying CVD and/or development of acute cardiac injury might confer an increased risk of death (Table 1).",

Approximately 20% of patients had cardiac injury. A similar study demonstrated factors associated with outcomes in 187 patients with COVID-19. They showed that 35% had underlying CVD (hypertension, coronary heart disease, or cardiomyopathy), and 28% showed evidence of acute myocardial injury (defined as elevated troponin T). Furthermore, mortality was significantly higher in individuals with high troponin T levels than in those with normal troponin T levels. In addition, patients with high troponin T levels were older and had more comorbidities, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathy, and chronic kidney disease [2].",

Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and their isoenzymes as well as the protein troponin I (TnI), which exhibited better cardiac specificity, are linked with injury of the heart muscle. Chen et al. reported that among the 99 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 13 (13%) presented elevated CK, and 75 (76%) showed elevated LDH [7]. Wang et al. revealed the clinical characteristics of 138 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, showing elevated TnI in 10 (7.2%), whereas 23 (16.7%) had arrhythmia [8]. In addition, Guan et al. demonstrated that 13.7% of COVID-19 patients showed elevated CK levels, and 37.2% showed increased LDH levels [9]. Although SARS-CoV-2 potentially invades alveolar epithelial cells, resulting in an acute systemic inflammatory response [4, 6], the exact etiology and mechanisms of elevation of cardiac biomarkers among patients with COVID-19 have not yet been reported. The identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional receptor for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, provides clues about their indirect association with cardiovascular pathology. The ACE2 receptor, the binding point for SARS-CoV-2, is abundantly found in myocytes. Therefore, myocyte damage from a direct viral attack could very well be the predominant mechanism.",

The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 can result in alteration of ACE2 signaling pathways, leading to acute myocardial and lung injury.
