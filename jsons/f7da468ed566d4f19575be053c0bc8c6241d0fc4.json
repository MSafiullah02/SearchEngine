This paper focuses on studying the dense deployment based air pollution monitoring using IoT enabled low-cost sensor nodes. For this, total nine low-cost IoT nodes monitoring particulate matter (PM), which is one of the most dominant pollutants, are deployed in a small educational campus in Indian city of Hyderabad. Out of these, eight IoT nodes were developed at IIIT-H while one was bought off the shelf. A web based dashboard website is developed to easily monitor the real-time PM values. The data is collected from these nodes for more than five months. Different analyses such as correlation and spatial interpolation are done on the data to understand efficacy of dense deployment in better understanding the spatial variability and time-dependent changes to the local pollution indicators.",

            "text": "Air pollution is one of the world's largest environmental causes of diseases and premature death [1] . Out of different air pollutants, particulate matter (PM) has been identified as one of the most dangerous pollutants. Because of long-term exposure of PM, every year millions of people die and many more become seriously ill with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases [2] . The issues are more aggravated in a developing country like India, where large sections of the population are exposed to high levels of PM levels [3] . With increasing urbanization, the situation is only going to get worse. Recent study in [4] has also shown that a small increase in long-term exposure to PM2.5 leads to a large increase in COVID-19 death rate. Therefore, it is important to develop tools for monitoring PM so that timely decisions can be made. In this paper, the focus is particularly on monitoring mass concentrations of PM2.5 (fine PM or particles with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 \u00b5m) and PM10 (coarse PM or particles with aerodynamic diameter between 2.5 \u00b5m and 10 \u00b5m) as these two PMs are mostly linked with human health impacts [3] .",

Also, these stations provide temporally more coarse data (hourly or daily). This in turn leads to low spatio-temporal resolution which is not enough to understand the exposure of citizens to pollution, which is non-uniformly distributed over the city. Second issue is that the measured pollution data at the monitoring stations and estimates at other locations are not readily available [6] . This lack of access to information results in lack of awareness among the citizens regarding the pollution in their area of residence or frequently visited locations such as home, office, schools and gardens.",

The low-cost portable ambient sensors provide a huge opportunity in increasing the spatio-temporal resolution of the air pollution information and are even able to verify, fine-tune or improve the existing ambient air quality models [7] . It has been shown in [6] that a low-cost monitoring system, which is not as accurate as a traditional and expensive one, can still provide reliable indications about air quality in a local area. IoT along with dense deployment of such lowcost sensors can provide real-time access of pollution data with high spatio-temporal resolution. Government and citizens can use this information to identify pollution hot-spots so that timely and localized decisions can be made regarding reducing and preventing air pollution.",

In [7] , [8] , the performances of different low-cost optical PM2.5 sensors such as Nova SDS011, Winsen ZH03A, Plantower PMS7003, Honeywell HPMA115S0 and Alphasense OPC-N2 have been evaluated. Authors in [3] presented regulatory PM2.5 and PM10 data availability along with the current status of the national monitoring networks and plans. In [2] and [8] , very few (six and three, respectively) IoT nodes measuring PM2.5 and PM10 were deployed in different geographical regions of Santiago, Chile, and Southampton, UK respectively, to examine the suitability of low-cost sensors for PM monitoring in urban environment. However, there is a dearth of actual deployment and measurements of dense IoT network to map fine spatio-temporal PM variations, which is precisely the focus of this paper. This paper focuses on studying the dense deployment based air pollution monitoring using IoT enabled low-cost sensor nodes in Indian urban conditions. For this, eight sensor nodes measuring PM2.5 and PM10 are developed and deployed in IIIT-H campus, which is 0.267 km 2 . A web-based dashboard is developed to easily monitor the real-time air pollution 1 . One of the eight deployed nodes is co-located with commercially available and factory-calibrated sensor node with a view of calibrating developed sensor nodes. The data is collected from these nine nodes for approximately five months. Correlation analysis is done to understand correlation between different nodes in this denser (than traditional) deployment. For spatial interpolation, inverse distance weighing (IDW) scheme is used on these nodes for the data collected before and during the bursting of firecrackers on the main night of Diwali (one of the most popular festivals in India) to show the variability pattern in a small campus, hot spot detection and need for a dense deployment to provide better local pollution indicators.",

In this paper, density based clustering algorithm in [16] has been employed to identify the outliers and the vectors with outlier have been dropped. Environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity can affect the working of laser based PM sensors like SDS011. For example, there is overestimation of PM values at higher humidity. As such, these points also act as outliers and the corresponding vectors are removed using the density based clustering. \u2022 Data averaging helps to look past random fluctuation and see the central trend of a data set.

If both sets of quantiles have come from the same distribution, the scatter plot form a line that's roughly straight. Many distributional aspects like shifts in location, scale, symmetry, and the presence of outliers can be detected from these plots. For two data sets that come from similar populations whose data distribution functions differ only by shifts mentioned earlier, the data points lie along a straight line displaced either up or down from the 45-degree reference line.

However, using nearest measurement point to approximate the PM value at a location of interest may lead to erroneous results given the variability of pollution levels and weather in different locations in an urban environment. This can be mitigated by using spatial interpolation to estimate the PM values at unmeasured locations using known values at the measurement locations. In this paper, we have used IDW, which is one of the simplest and popular deterministic spatial interpolation technique [17] . IDW follows the principle that the nodes that are closer to the location of estimation will have more impact than the ones which are farther away. IDW uses linearly weighted combination of the measured values at the nodes to estimate the parameter at the location of interest. The weight corresponding to a node is a function of inverse distance between the location of the node and the location of the estimate. In this paper, weights have been chosen to be inverse distance squared.",

It has been shown that correlation coefficient between some nodes in the same campus have low values demonstrating that the PM values across a small region may be significantly different. Moreover, the IDW-based spatial interpolation results on the day of Diwali show significant spatial variation in PM values in the campus ranging from 96 to 382 for locations just a few hundred meters apart for PM10.

The deployment period of the nodes has been more than five months from 26 October 2019 to 10 April 2020. Four important observations can be made from this figure. First, a clear peak can be observed for all nodes on 27 October 2019 resulting from the widespread burning of firecrackers during the celebration of Diwali festival. Dominant peaks can be seen at Node5-FLYG and Node4-FCYQ, where residents of the campus burst crackers. However, the peak in PM values due to fire-crackers died down in next few days. Second observation from the figure is that the PM values again started increasing with the onset of winter in November 2019 and peak in December 2019 and January 2020 during peak winter with temperatures in Hyderabad between 10-30 \u2022 C. Third observation is that as the winter weakens inFebruary2020, the PM values in general started decreasing. Final observation is that the PM plots show very low values of PM in March and April 2020. This can be attributed to the drastic reduction in traffic and construction activities in and around campus as the State and Central Government gradually started increasing restrictions to prevent spread of Covid-19 from the first week of March and finally declared nationwide lockdown since 22 March 2020 till 30 April 2020. Kendall's correlation between the nodes for PM2.5 and PM10. Kendall's correlation coefficients \u03c4 between the nine sensor nodes have been calculated using five minute PM10 samples. The significant variation between correlation values highlight the spatial variability between the PM values at different nodes. The maximum amount of correlation has been shown by the Node6-FTBG and Node8-Library. The least correlation for both PM2.5 and PM10 is shown by Node2-Maingate and Node9-OBH, which are farthest from each other by about 600 m. Node5-FLYG and Node6-FTBG also show very high amount of correlation of 0.9223 and 0.8926 for PM2.5 and PM10 values, respectively. Node5-FLYG and Node6-FTBG both are placed in similar geographical conditions (facing an open ground). Node9-OBH shows very less correlation in most of the pairs of nodes, as the node is located far inside the residential block of the campus with close to zero vehicle frequency. Kendall's coefficients have also been calculated between the Node1-Airveda and the six CPCB stations deployed across the city and the values are shown in the Table II. The kendall's coeffiecients vary from as low as 0.17 to maximum being 0.68 in the case of PM2.5 and 0.37 to 0.47 in the case of PM10. In general the values are lesser than 0.5 which implies very weak relationship between the stations. The nearest CPCB station from the Node1-Airveda show Kendall tau values of 0.47 and 0.68 for PM10 and PM2.5 respectively indicating the very low relation between two locations which are approximately only 3 km apart. This shows the necessity for local PM monitoring for a better understanding of the street-level values.",
