However, the extreme user-POI matrix sparsity and the varying spatio-temporal context pose challenges for POI systems, which affects the quality of POI recommendations. To this end, we propose a translation-based relation embedding for POI recommendation. Our approach encodes the temporal and geographic information, as well as semantic contents effectively in a low-dimensional relation space by using Knowledge Graph Embedding techniques. To further alleviate the issue of user-POI matrix sparsity, a combined matrix factorization framework is built on a user-POI graph to enhance the inference of dynamic personal interests by exploiting the side-information.

A great number of Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) have consequently been established e.g., Foursquare, Gowalla, Facebook Places, and Brightkite. The LBSNs often provide POI services that recommend users new POI venues that meet specific user criteria. In this paper, we develop a high quality personalized POI recommendation system by leveraging user check-in data. There are three technical challenges listed as follows: Spatial Reasoning. A user's current geographical location limits their choice of check-in POIs [13] . Many approaches model relations between a user's current geographical location and their preferences with respect to the surrounding POIs. h + r = t u + r t = e 1 and e 1 + r l = v u + (r t \u2022 r l ) = v",

However, the traditional collaborative filtering techniques such as Matrix Factorization (MF) cannot deal with the above problems in a unified manner.

However, previous studies do not offer insights on the following challenges: (1) how to construct a user-POI graph that utilizes the user check-in data with side information, such as spatio-temporal data and semantic context information, to leverage data sparsity problem; (2) how to effectively integrate a translation-based embedding model with a traditional recommendation system to improve the quality of POI recommendation.",

In [22, 25] , geographical locations are used to improve the performance of POI system which highlights that there is a strong correlation between user checkin activities and geographical distance.

[27] proposed a collaborative KG-integrated movie recommender framework to learn the latent and visual representations. Palumbo et al . [16] proposed entity2rec to capture a user-item relatedness from KGEs with the goal of generating top-k item recommendations. Qian et al . [18] adopts KGE to model the side information in POI recommendation system. Their work only focuses on embedding the user and POI entities, and mapping the spatio-temporal patterns as a translation matrix. Although their work explored KGEs and RS, it did not integrate graph embedding with the traditional MF model. Compared with our proposed model that combines the spatial and temporal information with semantic contents in a semantic relation embedding space, these KG embedding-based recommender models have limited expressive abilities as they model the key parameters (e.g., spatial and temporal information) as a simple matrix. Finally, noteworthy is the family of Graph Convolutional Networks with models such as GCN [7] , GraphSAGE [5] , adversary GCN [20] , kernel-based CKN [14] as well as generic graph embedding approaches such as DeepWalk [17] and Node2Vec [4] which all have the capacity to model graph-related tasks.",

We traverse all the training triplets for 1000 rounds on both Foursquare and Gowalla datasets. Fig. 2 reports the performance of the POI recommendation models on Foursquare and Gowalla datasets, respectively. We present the performance for k = {1, 5, 10, 20}. Figure 2 presents the results of algorithms in terms of P rec@k, Rec@k and F 1@k on Foursquare and Gowalla datasets. The figure show that the proposed GERec model outperforms all baseline models significantly for all metrics at different k values. Specifically, when comparing with the traditional MF models, GERec outperforms the Rank-GeoMF, which is the MF baseline with the best performance, by 50% and 47% in F1-score@10 on Foursquare and Gowalla, respectively. When comparing with translation-based models, our proposed model also improves the POI recommendation performance significantly. GERec outperforms STA, by 20% and 25% in F1-score@10 on both datasets. This demonstrates the capability of our graph-based GERec model to generate high quality POI recommendations. Although GeoSoCa exploits social influences, geographical locations and user interests, the simple kernel density estimation results in the poor performance. This validates the effectiveness of our GERec solution, especially our proposed step which exploits and integrates the user-POI interactions and spatio-temporal patterns to tackle the sparsity in the user-POI check-in data. The learned embeddings are well integrated into the combined matrix factorization model. Thus, GERec achieves the best performance among all compared baseline models. The user-POI graph constructed from Gowalla dataset has fewer relation edges than the Foursquare graph, as Gowalla relation patterns r tl have fewer regions in the relation paths than Foursquare.",

Table 2 shows the impact of the length of time slot on Precision@k and Recall@k. The length of the time slot affects the quality of POI recommendations. When the length of time slot changes, the relation paths change and the entire graph needs to be computed again. We split day activities into different lengths. The parameter h denotes the length of each time slot in hours. The larger length of time slot the less the time influence on recommendation results. We report the top-k recommendation precision and recall for each time slot on the Foursquare and Gowalla datasets. From the experimental results we observe that the POI recommendation accuracy improves when the time slot length increases. The recommendation accuracy reaches a peak point for 8 h long time slot. Then, it starts decreasing as the time slot keeps increasing. The reason for the improved accuracy is that the larger time length, the denser the data. Hence, there are more user check-in records at each time slot for generating recommendations. However, the recommendation accuracy decreases as the length of the time slot reaches 8 h. This is because when the length of the time slot is large enough, it may reduce the influence of temporal pattern. Moreover, we study the impact of varying dimension d of the relation embedding by setting it to {70, 80, 90, 100, 120} ( Table 3 ). The best parameter is determined according to the mean rank in the test set. The accuracy rate increases gradually when the dimension increases. Specifically, the accuracy keeps increasing until the dimension reaches 100, then it remains stable. ",

To overcome the sparsity of the user-POI interaction data, we develop an embedding function which bridges gaps between the translation-based embedding model and traditional MF-based model.
