Several infectious outbreaks have been simulated through this model, assessing related risks in a systematic manner [18, 19].

On the other hand, activity driven networks (ADNs) describe contact processes that evolve over time-varying networks [25], when timing and duration of connections happen over short time scales [14, 26\u201329], comparable with the dynamics of the process running on the network nodes.",

The chapter is organized as follows. In Sect. 14.2, we offer a review of the working principles of the original ADN formulation. Toward a more realistic treatment of behavioral factors, in Sect. 14.3 we study the effect of individual behavior on the spreading of the epidemic in an SIS process, summarizing our published work [35]. Our findings are then successfully applied in Sect. 14.4 to model the 2014\u20132015 outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Liberia. After a calibration phase, the model is used to offer a one-year prediction of the case count, which is confirmed by field data. A what-if analysis on the effect of timely sanitary intervention is also presented, borrowing from our published work [36]. In Sect. 14.5, we examine a mathematical framework that we recently established in [37] for the analytical treatment of ADNs, which enables the analysis of the network dynamics beyond the computation of the epidemic threshold. Finally, conclusions and potential lines of future work are presented in Sect. 14.6.",

In other words, we run our EVD model by only changing the time when the transition between Phase 1 and Phase 2 takes place. We consider the following possible dates: early July (day 76), early June (day 46), and early May (day 16). Figure 14.8a displays the forecasted cumulative case counts associated with the selected times. As expected, anticipating the implementation of more effective intervention policies drastically reduces the epidemic spreading. For example, the outbreak would have ended with a 72% reduction of the total Ebola cases (i.e., 2,830 rather than 9,922) by anticipating the increase in the level of interventions to day 76.\n\n",

Figure 14.8c shows the number of hospitalized persons as a function of time for the same instances considered in Figs. 14.8a,b. To implement a desired intervention policy at a given time, the number of available hospital beds must be larger than or equal to the number of persons that should be theoretically hospitalized. Therefore, the peak value of the number of hospitalized persons predicted by the model can be used to estimate the numbers of beds that should be made available in the country. Figure 14.8c suggests that anticipating the implementation of more effective intervention policies reduces the size of the infrastructure that should be available. While the mid-August timing is estimated to require 331 beds, anticipating it to early in July would have only required 91 beds.",

To verify this claim and demonstrate the correspondence between continuous- and discrete-time epidemic models, we consider two different dynamics on real-world phenomena, modeled through ADNs: flu spreading in a university campus and trend diffusion on Twitter. System parameters are obtained from case studies [25, 98\u2013101], as detailed in [37]. We compare the outcome of Monte Carlo simulations averaged over 200 trials for both the continuous- and the discrete-time processes, along with the integration of the deterministic ODE system (14.6). In both examples, the activity distribution is discretized over k = 59 equidistant activation classes. Figure 14.9 demonstrates the equivalence of our approach with respect to traditional ADNs in Monte Carlo simulations, along with the validity of system (14.6) to exactly predict the epidemic spreading.\n\n",

Simulation results in Fig. 14.11 demonstrate the accuracy of the bounds in capturing the transient response. Higher endemic equilibria seem manifest into tighter prediction bounds during the transient, albeit the upper bound becomes conservative as time progresses. In general, the predictions of the endemic state from k\n\u2217 = 2 are less precise than the simpler closed-form results for k\n\u2217 = 1. This is related to the solutions of the ancillary ODEs (14.9a) and (14.9b) leaving the bounds for k\n\u2217 = 1. With this in mind, the overall prediction accuracy could be improved by combining the bounds in Figs. 14.10 and 14.11.\n",
