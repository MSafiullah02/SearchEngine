Currently, genitourinary remodeling may be performed using one\u2019s own non-urologic tissues such as digestive tract, skin, or different parts of the body; tissues or heterologous materials such as bovine collagen; and homologous tissues and/or synthetic materials (Atala 2008). All of these materials often lead to various post-reconstruction complications resulting from the rejection of transplanted tissue or potentially different performance parameters that cause system failure. This state of noncompliance can lead to metabolic complications, in addition to infection and other issues (Atala 2007). Therefore, definitely replacing lost or damaged urologic tissue with healthy tissues by reconstructive surgery can improve the genitourinary system. This can be achieved using tissue engineering and stem cell techniques (Selim et al. 2011; Orabi et al. 2013).",

            "text": "In bladder tissue engineering, scaffolds have been synthesized with the appropriate batteries and then stem cells will be cultured on the scaffolds and differentiate into the smooth muscle cells (SMC). Scaffold as a synthetic extracellular matrix (ECM) simulate the biological and mechanical activities of the natural ECM (Green and Elisseeff 2016). In fact, biomaterials can provide a three-dimensional (3D) and nano-scale space for the cells to transform into new tissues with proper functions and structure, as well as allowing the targeted delivery of the cells and bioactive factors (Ma 2008). Several natural and synthetic polymers have been introduced for use in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (O\u2019Brien 2011). Chitin and its acetylated compound are the most abundant natural polymers after cellulose. Chitosan has been studied numerously to produce the scaffolds for various tissue engineering applications in bone, skin, and cartilage. Because of its antibacterial, antiviral, non-toxic, and high tensile properties and also its biocompatibility and biodegradability (Islam et al. 2017), polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA) is the most abundant water-soluble synthetic polymer, produced from polymerization of vinyl acetate monomer to polyvinyl acetate and then hydrolysis to PVA. The polar nature and water solubility, non-toxicity, desirable adhesion properties, and high tensile strength make this polymer suitable for use in natural composites (Kadajji and Betageri 2011). It is one of the few polymers with simple carbon-carbon interconnections between the constituent units, which is perfect for biodegradation if suitable conditions are available (Marin et al. 2014). Collagen is the most abundant protein in the natural ECM of most tissues, and it is also widely used among natural polymers for use in polymeric scaffold construction. Collagen has a regular nanometer fiber structure with an overall 3D structure. The easy access to collagen and its unique structure led the researchers to pay special attention to this polymer (Dong and Lv 2016). Collagen is well adapted to the human biological system and its immune responses are quite similar to that of the host tissue. In addition, the collagen can be extracted from healthy tissues.",

Bio-factors can be selected among growth factors, differentiation inducers, and other natural macromolecules. In this study, curcumin was selected as a bio-factor since its intrinsic toxicity is low and it has also numerous pharmacological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties (Anand et al. 2007). Curcumin has also been traditionally known as a lipid lowering agent, liver protector, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, protease inhibitor, free radical scavenger, and so on (Bengmark 2006).",

Tissue regeneration requires a sufficient number of cells that do not stimulate the immune response. Different types of cells are used for tissue engineering applications, which can be classified into non-stem cells or adult cells and stem cells. Each of these cells has its advantages and disadvantages. Although mature cells are undeniably important for tissue engineering, the aggressive method of providing and low proliferative potential of these cells has led researchers to use stem cells as a promising alternative source of cells that target tissue (Caplan 2007). Stem cells can be embryonic or adult, although embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are thought to be much more potent than adult stem cells (ASCs), there are several ethical and medicinal arguments for their use in humans. In addition, the invasive method of ASCs preparation, with age-dependent proliferative and differentiating features, has led to the introduction of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for use in regenerative medicine in recent decades (Takahashi and Yamanaka 2006; Appasani and Appasani 2011). These cells are produced by reprogramming the patient\u2019s somatic cells and have proliferative and differentiating features such as embryonic stem cells, while lacking embryonic and adult stem cell problems.",

            "text": "Tissue injury and organ loss caused by degenerative diseases or neoplasia is still a major challenge. Appropriate methods to replace damaged tissues require a variety of techniques that face many difficulties. Generally, end-stage limb failure is treated with the intended tissue transplant, but the results are usually not fully satisfactory due to immune suppression complications, increased number of failed transplants, and reduced number of organ donors (Abouna 2003; Greenwald et al. 2012). Therefore, discovering other ways to replace or repair damaged tissues and organs is essential. Regenerative medicine and tissue engineering are working to understand the mechanisms of tissue regeneration, and to find a way to regenerate damaged tissues (Wobma and Vunjak-Novakovic 2016). It can be possible to repair the function of vital organs by improving the ability of the tissue to regenerate itself, or by developing alternative biological tissues that are able to compensate for the correct function of the missing organs (Baddour et al. 2012). Our goal in this project was to design a nanofibrous scaffold with appropriate morphological, mechanical, and physiological properties for use in the bladder tissue engineering. Previously, we used Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (Ardeshirylajimi et al. 2018), poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) (Mirzaei et al. 2019), and polyacrylonitrile/polyethylene oxide (PAN/PEO) (Fakhrieh et al. 2019) nanofibrous scaffolds for bladder tissue engineering, despite good results in stem cell differentiation into smooth muscle cells, but scaffolds were not mechanically appropriate for the bladder tissue engineering. Herein, we used a combination of natural and synthetic polymers to make the scaffold more similar to the bladder, chitosan was selected as a natural polymer with unique properties, collagen was selected as the other natural polymer found in abundance in the bladder matrix, and PVA as a synthetic polymer was also selected to improve structural and mechanical properties of the tissue engineering scaffold. In addition, a natural active ingredient called curcumin was also used to take advantage of its intrinsic properties to improve the stem cell differentiation process into bladder SMCs. Fabricated scaffolds demonstrated the fibrous structure with interconnected pores without any bead, with proper curcumin release and absolute biocompatibility for use in tissue engineering applications. In the presence of the curcumin, protein adsorption, cell attachment, and cell viability were increased significantly. However, the highest amounts of these parameters were detected in the curcumin-incorporated nanofiber group, which showed a synergic relationship between curcumin and nanofibrous structure. In agreeing with our results, Golchin et al. demonstrated that incorporating the curcumin in chitosan/PVA/ carbopol/PCL improved biological behavior of the nanofibers and in addition mesenchymal stem cell viability was also increased while cultured on the curcumin-incorporated nanofibers compared with those nanofibers without curcumin (Golchin et al. 2019).",

            "text": "According to the results obtained in this study, human iPSCs viability and its SMC differentiation potential were increased in the presence of curcumin. On the other hand, chitosan/Col/PVA nanofibrous scaffold has also a great potential to support SMC differentiation of the human iPSCs. With the combination of these two factors by incorporating of curcumin in the nanofibers, SMC differentiation potential of the human iPSCs was significantly increased compared with the other groups. These characteristics of the fabricated nanofibers could also be the results of the presence of different natural and synthetic biopolymers in its structure.",
