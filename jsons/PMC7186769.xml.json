Our swipe cards have been deactivated for an initial period of 4 weeks, taking in the planned 2-week mid-semester break, denying us access to our offices and campuses. Our Facebook feeds consider the question of productivity for an academic under lockdown; an email update on the situation helpfully suggests making use of all this time at home to \u2018get on with our research\u2019. We know we are incredibly privileged to be among the few in our communities who can continue to work at all, and go on being paid as normal.",

The pandemic is pedagogical; it is a lesson or test for humanity. It makes us look again at everything we thought was important: it is not only a medical but also an existential crisis, a crossroads, a crack in the facade of \u2018reality\u2019 that underpins the system we have been calling \u2018business as usual\u2019. The variation in response seen in different \u2018Western\u2019 countries provides evidence of the differing philosophies on which they are based: the stark choice between people and profit laid bare, the emptiness of neoliberal rhetoric now becoming embarrassingly apparent. The UK PM, who boasted in early March of visiting hospitals and shaking hands with infected people, is now in ICU, ill with the virus for nearly a fortnight. Lack of preparedness and an initially laissez-faire approach have precipitated a terrible demonstration, still unfolding at the time of writing (April 2020), of the limits of \u2018American exceptionalism\u2019 (Levitz 2019).",

It appears the UK and US initially considered allowing the infection to take its course in the population under the belief that it would quickly become less virulent, and the community would develop natural herd immunity, as happens for the host of viruses with which humans already cope, with sick and old people being the most affected. This kind of thinking was predicted long ago by Jonathon Swift in his satirical \u2018modest proposal\u2019 that babies born to impoverished families could be the basis of a useful edible product for consumption by the wealthy (Swift 1995).",

It is also a crisis for education: how can teaching and learning proceed as normal in such an abnormal world? Presence is fundamental to the interpersonal relationships that underpin education, and which cannot be replaced by use of technology. Yet, if we have always accepted correspondence and home schooling as viable alternatives for families under certain circumstances, such as living in remote locations or as a matter of political/religious preference, there is a logical argument that such arrangements could feasibly become the \u2018new normal\u2019 of schooling.",

The neoliberal tendency towards \u2018presentism\u2019 engenders an amnesia that denies access to history for explaining the reasons for current conditions. But the expansion of economistic thinking to the entire planetary system, on which the current form of neoliberalism is based, also denies access to modes of thought that would prepare for possible futures (such as so-called \u2018black swan\u2019 events), based on realistic estimations of human behaviour and motivation. \u2018Access denied\u2019 refers to the denial of the full spectrum of human cognition and creativity in the genres and frameworks available to scholars and thinkers of all stripes, under globalised neoliberal policy conditions.",

The Black Death of the fourteenth century had huge economic results, effectively ending the feudal system in much of Europe. There had been cracks in the system beforehand, but the Black Death, by altering the relationship between employer and labourer, speeded its uneven demise. Although serfdom did not cease in Russia until the nineteenth century, through most of Western Europe, the financial relationships between aristocracy and labourer were forever altered. What analogous results might arise from this pandemic? Will the social and financial status of frontline essential workers through the pandemic\u2014nurses, health assistants, grocery workers\u2014be improved?",

Will we experience something similar to this reaction? Is the now widespread acceptance of the role of technology and its accompanying surveillance a likely outcome of this experience? What will be the spatial effects of \u2018stay in place\u2019? Will we head towards some kind of intellectual cottage industries, somewhat like the early industrial revolution, with the computer replacing the spinning wheel, as big employers such as universities see the possibility of not providing space or equipment to white collar workers?",

Eyam paid a huge toll itself, but won the eternal gratitude of its neighbours\u2014and, incidentally, made a living for itself centuries later, by capitalising on the tourists fascinated by its history. It seems Aotearoa New Zealand could become the Eyam of the twenty-first century, but by providing an example of good leadership and effective use of science and scientists, rather than by sacrificing itself. This exemplary pandemic response in itself is a tribute to the quality of our education system that has evolved over the last 200 years. We have an educated population, despite the presence of a few \u2018idiots\u2019\u2014and an educated leadership. Our ability to pull together is a priceless result.",
