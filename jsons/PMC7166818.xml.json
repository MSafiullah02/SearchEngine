            "text": "Dyspnoea is defined as laboured or difficult breathing and is a common reason for the emergency presentation of feline patients in veterinary medicine. Early clinical signs may be difficult for owners to appreciate until the signs have become severe. Therefore, dyspnoeic cats are frequently presented as acute emergencies. Investigations to discover the underlying aetiology must be balanced with the status of the cat (Tseng and Waddell 2000) as stress can be detrimental in these patients. Frequently supportive treatment and stabilisation of the patient is necessary before further investigations can be undertaken.",

            "text": "Feline dyspnoea can be due to upper airway disease, lower airway disease, pulmonary parenchymal disease, pleural disease, mediastinal disease, cardiac diseases, thoracic damage and extra\u2010thoracic diseases. Upper airway disease includes stenotic nares, rhinitis, nasal neoplasia, laryngeal disease and tracheal lesions (Schachter and Norris 2000, Jakubiak and others 2005). Lower airway diseases include extraluminal airway compression, foreign bodies, chronic bronchitis/asthma and smoke inhalation (Corcoran and others 1995, Foster and others 2004). Pulmonary parenchymal disorders include bronchopneumonia, aspiration pneumonia, non\u2010cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, intrapulmonary haemorrhage, pulmonary thromboembolism and pulmonary neoplasia (Ohn and others 2004, Schermerhorn and others 2004, Grandi and others 2005). Pleural diseases, most commonly pleural effusions, have a variety of aetiologies, including infectious [for example, feline coronavirus infection or feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), bacterial pyothorax], neoplastic or cardiac. Mediastinal disease includes neoplasia, toxins (for example, paraquat and warfarin poisoning) and infections. Common neoplastic causes are lymphoma and thymoma (Patnaik and others 2003, Jakubiak and others 2005). Cardiac disease includes acquired disease (particularly the cardiomyopathies such as hypertrophic, dilated, restrictive, unclassified and arrhythmogenic right ventricular primary forms, and secondary cardiomyopathies) and congenital cardiac diseases (Ferasin and others 2003, Chetboul and others 2006, Schrope and Kelch 2007). Dyspnoea in cardiac disease is usually associated with pulmonary oedema or pleural effusion. However, congenital right to left shunting cardiac defects may result in dyspnoea due to chronic hypoxaemia. Thoracic damage can result in dyspnoea from pleural effusion, pneumothorax, diaphragmatic hernia, pulmonary contusions or rib fractures. Extra\u2010thoracic diseases include anaemia or heatstroke (Luis Fuentes 1998, Martin and Corcoran 2006). The diseases listed cause dyspnoea via obstruction of airways, restriction of lung parenchyma, parenchymal impairment, pulmonary oedema, pleural effusion, ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch and haematological disorders.",

In addition, a T4 assay was performed in cases suspected of having acquired heart disease. Bronchoscopy and broncho\u2010alveolar lavage (BAL) were performed in dyspnoeic cases where a respiratory cause was suspected once these cases were stable enough to tolerate anaesthesia. In cases with a suspected infectious cause for pleural effusion, fluid cytology, bacteriological culture and feline coronavirus serology were performed.

For categorical variables, comparison between groups was made after constructing contingency tables using chi\u2010squared test or Fisher's exact test. Demographics of the LUSATH Feline Hospital Population were compared with the dyspnoeic population. In analysing the numbers of pedigree cats, all breeds were grouped and compared with all non\u2010pedigree cats (domestic short or longhaired; DSH, DLH). In investigating any differences between age when comparing the age of the dyspnoeic population with the hospital population, ages were grouped as < 2 years, 2 to 5 years, 6 to 10 years, 11 to 15 years and >16 years. Neutered cats were included in their gender group, to compare total numbers of males and females, because very few entire cats were present in the dyspnoeic population.

In our study, despite the apparently acute presentation, cats with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were more likely to survive to discharge than cats with other forms of primary cardiomyopathy, which has not been documented previously. In an earlier study, cats with HCM, UCM and moderator band cardiomyopathy had better long\u2010term survival than those with DCM and RCM (Ferasin and others 2003). Our population had a mean age of 6\u00b74 years, similar to the previously mentioned study (6\u00b78 years).
