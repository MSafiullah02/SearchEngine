Economists, however, have not addressed it much, except for Fudenberg and Levine (2006).\n3 The authors look into how superstitions can persist if people are rational, and which types of superstitions would be more likely to persist. They construct a game-theoretic model with rational learning, taking superstitions as beliefs on events off the equilibrium path. They characterize the conditions under which a false belief can persist. Two important implications follow. First, under the rationality assumption, some superstitions can persist. Second, in equilibrium, persistent superstitions in turn do affect the behavior of people. The second implication is important, and it forms the theoretical basis of this paper.",

They find that houses ending with a \u201clucky\u201d number are more expensive. Chau, Ma, and Ho (2001) investigate the lucky number \u201c8\u201d in determining real estate prices.

First, our data cover two distinct periods: before and after a major policy change in 2006, which is the introduction of an entirely different type of license plates. It provides us a unique opportunity to study the change in the value of superstitions in response to the policy change. We also link the data to the stock market index and examine whether the value of superstitions varies with the macroeconomic environment. Second, we estimate plates of different types separately, rather than jointly as in Woo and Kwok (1994), and Woo et al. (2008). In addition to being a strategy to disentangle the effect of superstitions from the effect of conspicuous consumption, a point discussed in Section 3.1, our estimation strategy allows us to ask how the value of superstitions changes across different types of plates, a question addressed in Section 4.2.1. It is important to note that although we use a different estimation strategy, our estimated coefficients are consistent with those in Woo and Kwok (1994), and Woo et al.

There are companies bidding plates in auctions, aiming at trading them for profit.\n14 Their valuations of a plate, therefore, depend on their estimates of its future price. These bidders\u2019 valuations have a common value component. This leads to the possibility of the winner\u2019s curse: the winning bidder is the most optimistic one who over-estimates the future price.\n15 The common value component makes it non-trivial to map winning bids to social cost.

We continue to observe this in Table 9. The change we look into is the premium on replacing a \u201c4\u201d with an \u201c8\u201d on a plate. On average, such number replacement adds 107.7% to the price of ordinary 3-digit plates before 2006 but only 52.6% after 2006, which is a percentage drop of 51.16%. The corresponding figures are 59.9% to the price of ordinary 4-digit plates before 2006 and 43.7% after 2006. The percentage drop was 27.05%. Ordinary 3-digit plates respond to the introduction of personalized plates in a bigger magnitude compared with ordinary 4-digit plates.",

We conjecture that the value people attach to superstitions change across different macroeconomic environments, but the changes are asymmetric in positive and negative superstitions. By positive superstitions, we mean the false belief that some logically unrelated items or actions bring good luck. Negative superstitions are the opposite case. We are not aware of any theory that distinguishes positive superstitions from negative superstitions.",
