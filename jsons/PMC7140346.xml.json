TME consists of tumor cells, tumor stromal cells including stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells and immune cells like microglia, macrophages and lymphocytes and the non-cellular components of extracellular matrix such as collagen, fibronectin, hyaluronan, laminin, among others [2, 3]. As the heart of TME, tumor cells control the function of cellular and non-cellular components through complex signaling networks to use the non-malignant cells to work for their own benefit. The consequence of such crosstalks is reflected in tumor formation and maintenance as well as deficient response to therapy and multi-drug resistance (MDR). The non-malignant cells in the TME are known to promote tumorigenesis in all phases of cancer development and metastasis [4, 5].",

However, clinical trials have not yielded consistent conclusions [28, 29]. While several studies have shown that greater pericytes coverage corresponds to a better diagnosis [30], others indicated that therapeutic targets involving pericytes may exacerbate the process of tumor metastasis [31\u201334]. In this line, Semb et al. showed that in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) Bret/ret. mouse model, pericyte deficiency causes the spreading of metastatic insulinoma-derived cells [31]. Likewise, Kalluri et al. reported that genetic knockdown of tumoral pericytes in breast cancer upsurges pulmonary tumorigenesis in NG2-TK mouse model [34]. In contrast to these reports, it is shown that the production of pericyte by cancer cells promotes the growth of glioma tumor. In this regard, analysis of human specimens has revealed that glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) are responsible for producing the majority of vascular pericytes to reshape the perivascular niche to support vascular function and tumor growth.

This can be achieved in part by using microfluidic systems that can recapitulate more complex biological interfaces that would otherwise be unattainable by two-dimensional (2D) systems to study the dynamic interaction of pericytes with different TME components under normal or pathological conditions. For example, a 3D self-organized microvascular model of the human blood-brain barrier (BBB) with endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes resembles the characteristic of a physiologic BBB similar to those of the rat brain, with perfusable and selective microvascularization and lower permeability than the conventional in vitro model [37].

Considering their origin, tumor-derived endothelial cells (TECs) can be produced directly by differentiation of cancer cells, where they allow ECs to migrate into the tumor or eventually leave the tumor. However, in this review, TECs are ECs that benefit tumors, regardless of their location (in- or outside the tumor site) and/or their cell of origin. TECs are not only involved in the angiogenesis process to support primary tumor growth, but also promote tumor progression, metastasis and drug resistance [41]. TECs contain stem cell-like populations and overexpress MDR1 and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and become resistant to chemotherapeutics such as paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil in vitro [43, 44].",

In fact, inhibitors of these pathways can target and block proliferation and pathological angiogenesis in vivo [53]. Moreover, TEC can be used for cancer vaccine development. In this sense, Nomura et al. developed a dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy, capable of targeting TECs. Prophylactic vaccination with DCs pulsed with lysates of TECs (positive for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity) isolated from the lung with metastases was shown to significantly suppress lung metastasis in the B16/BL6 mouse melanoma model.

In addition, 3D microfluidic system has enabled a high resolution, real-time imaging, and precise quantification of endothelial barrier function, which is essential for investigating the interaction of tumor cells during the metastasis process. The results indicated that secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) by macrophages can impair endothelial barrier as validated by a higher number and faster dynamics of TC-EC interactions in highly invasive fibrosarcoma cells [56]. Equally, 3D systems enable studying the organ-specific preference of metastatic cancer cells and the underlying molecular pathways/interactions. For example, a 3D vascularized organotypic microfluidic system is used to analyze organ-specific human breast cancer cell extravasation into muscle- and bone-containing matrices through a microvascular network concentrically wrapped with mural cells. The results indicated inhibitory role of adenosine on extravasation as blocking A3 adenosine receptors increased extravasation rates of breast cancer cells into the myoblast, mimicking microenvironments compared with untreated cells [57].",

A recent study on organoid and mouse models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma demonstrated the opposing roles of tumor-secreted ligands including transforming growth factor\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) and interleukin 1 (IL1) to produce two distinct CAF subtypes characterized by either myofibroblastic or inflammatory phenotypes. In this report, activation of IL1/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling generate inflammatory CAFs while TGF\u03b2 signaling antagonizes this process by downregulating interleukin 1 receptor, type I (IL1R1) expression and promoting differentiation into myofibroblasts [73]. Furthermore, tumor-stroma interactions are studied by 3D systems, in which CAFs derived from squamous carcinoma cells of the hypopharynx (FaDu) and head and neck cancer patients were incorporated into the tissue roll for the analysis of cellular environment and response (TRACER) platform. Results demonstrated that co-culture of CAFs with FaDu cells increased proliferation rate and invasive cell migration at 24 h and 48 h of culture with negligible effects on radiation resistance [74]. Moreover, in vitro organotypic microfluidic chip can be used to mechanistically investigate the TCs-CAFs interactions by co-culturing of breast cancer and patient-derived fibroblast cells in the 3D tumor and stroma regions, respectively. In this 3D model, CAFs were shown to enhance invasion and migration speed by inducing expression of a new candidate gene, glycoprotein nonmetastatic B (GPNMB) in breast cancer cells [75].",

An example for the exploitation of CAFs is demonstrated in a study in which the off-target distribution of anticancer nanoparticles (NPs) to fibroblasts, that creates an obstacle to the effective management of desmoplastic tumors [79\u201382], was exploited to selectively deliver therapeutics cargos to cancer cells. In this preparation, NP damage is used for selective delivery of plasmid coding cytotoxic proteins (the secretable TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (sTRAIL) DNA complexes) loaded into liposome-coated protamine. A further experiment in xenograft model of human desmoplastic bladder carcinoma showed that this strategy led to 70% of CAFs as sTRAIL-producing cells. This was sufficient to remodel activated CAF into resting cells, meanwhile eliciting apoptotic effects on the nest of adjacent tumor cells. Thus the use of NP to modify CAFs can be an effective strategy to treat desmoplastic cancers (Fig. 2b) [83].",

It has been recognized that TAMs may have both promoting (M1 type) and impairing roles (M2 type) when interfering with cancer treatments [92]. By producing migration-stimulating factors, TAMs give tumor cells the ability of motility and metastasis [93]. In this line, a study in human colorectal cancer (CRC) specimens and in vitro co-culture, revealed that TAMs induce EMT program to enhance CRC invasion, migration, and CTC-mediated metastasis by producing IL6 to activate JAK2/STAT3 axis and inhibit the suppressive role of miR-506-3p on FoxQ1 expression. This in turn leads to CCL2 production to promote macrophage infiltration. Blockade of IL6 or CCL2 demolishes this loop as evidenced by reduced mesenchymal CTC-mediated metastasis and macrophage migration, respectively [94]. Surprisingly, when interacting with apoptotic cancer cells in conditioned medium, TAMs inhibits TGF\u03b21-induced EMT and thus tumor invasion, which is considered the antitumor role of TAMs [95].

TAM targeting, in turn, can be achieved by barricading the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), which is essential for the recruitment, differentiation and survival of TAM [103] (Fig. 2c) [104]. Inhibitors of CSF1R can reduce TAM or cause phenotypic alterations that might hinder the growth and progression of cancer cells [92, 105\u2013107]. This formulation is found as a promising approach in treatment of a variety of cancers including breast, lung, colon and melanoma in preclinical settings [92]. Targeting functional TAM molecules also provides an effective therapeutic strategy. An interesting example is to block Fc receptors on TAM which avoid depletion of anti-PD1 antibodies and therefore enhances the efficiency of the checkpoint therapy [92, 108]. However, repression of Fc receptor may impose overall immunosuppressive effects, since these receptors are expressed in various immune cells such as myeloid cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes [109].",

Dynamic crosstalk is mediated by growth factors, chemokines and metastatic CTCs tethered to and released from the ECM, as well as metabolic changes of the cells within the tumor bulk [120, 121]. ECM may act as a barrier for drug delivery through increased tissue stiffness and desmoplasia or a gate for breaching the basement membrane to promote metastasis [2, 122]. Furthermore, the ECM of distant organs can be remotely shaped into permissive/restrictive soils by soluble factors/CTCs/exosomes from primary tumors to facilitate the seeding of metastasizing cancer cells (See for review [9]).",

Synthesis of collagen can be regulated by cancer cells, mutated genes, signaling pathways/receptors, and transcription factors [123]. Collagen in turn influences tumor cell behavior through integrins, tyrosine kinase receptors, discoidin domain receptors, and some signaling pathways [124]. Other partners in close contact with collagen involvement in cancer are microRNAs (miRNAs) [125] and exosomes [126]. Moreover, collagen interaction with other ECM molecules including fibronectin, laminin, hyaluronic acid, and MMPs influences cancer cell activity [127]. In addition, hypoxia, which is common in collagen-rich tumors, promotes cancer progression [124].",

In this context, the role of desmoplasia and stromal fibroblasts on anti-cancer drug resistance is being investigated, wherein highly invasive breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) were embedded in microwells surrounded by CAFs encapsulated within collagen I hydrogel. Combined administration of tranilast (anti-fibrotic drugs) and doxorubicin significantly diminished tumor growth and invasion, as validated by reduced stiffness of the stromal matrix, disrupted fibronectin assembly and reduced collagen fiber density [128]. Also, bi-transgenic tumor model confirmed the role of stromal collagen condensation as indication for mammary tumor initiation and progression. Furthermore, studying epithelial-stromal interactions in normal mammary glands, mammary tumors, and tumor explants in 3D culture revealed the role of collagen reorganization at the tumor-stromal interface to facilitate local invasion [129].",

For example, LOX enzymes are widely used to block collagen crosslinking in various preclinical settings [130, 131]. Alternatively, ECM components can be used to ensure a precise tumor drug delivery [132]. Tenascin-C, a300 kDa large glycoprotein, is overexpressed within the ECM of numerous cancer cells such as breast, colon, lung, and ovarian. Its concentration in healthy ECM is almost low-to-none [133]. It also derive proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis stages of tumor progression [134]. Dal Corso et al. introduced a study in which a non-internalizing antibody against tenascin-C was exploited to transport anthracycline (PNU159682), a chemotherapeutic agent, into the ECM of cancer cells (Fig. 2d). In the case of intravenous injection, the antibody-drug conjugate was found to bind to tenascin-C and the drug was discharged when the protease-sensitive linker between the antibody and the drug was cleaved. This in turn resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition of epidermoid carcinoma mouse xenografts [135]. Likewise, Chen et al. designed liposomes bound to tenascin-C peptide, as well as being loaded with navitoclax, a tiny molecule capable of causing apoptosis in CAFs. Such liposomes were capable of regulating the tumor ECM through efficiently removing CAFs, rendering the ECM accessible for doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles that were administered later [136].",

This formulation allowed drug targets to bind to the tumor stroma to exert their effects locally and gained a promising efficacy and safety profile compared to the unconjugated molecules tested in several mouse models.

Mechanistically, tumors secrete IL-6 and IL-8 cytokines to attract CTC while CTC infiltration into mammary tumors is mediated by MMP1/collagenase-1 and the actin cytoskeleton component fascin-1. Consequently, tumor self-seeding leads to enhanced angiogenesis, tumor growth, stromal recruitment through seed-derived factors including the chemokine CXCL1, anaplasia, tumor size, and vascularity.

Another study, involving 6712 breast cancer patients showed a decrease in the number of CTCs only in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+) or HER2- patients but not in the triple-negative ones and nor in patients who underwent surgery. Therapeutic regimes including metastatic treatment, adjuvant treatment, neoadjuvant treatment, or combination therapy were equally effective in reducing CTC positivity and the chance of disease progression [151]. In summary, despite uncertainty about the analytic validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility of CTCs, their status is a valuable indicator of the efficacy of cancer therapy, which may aid clinicians to make decisions for further personalized therapy.",

CTCs usually express simultaneously over one immune checkpoint [153], hence the blockage of multiple immune checkpoints can immediately confine more biomarkers among CTCs with higher immune recognition avidity. In this sense, Lian et al. described a unique set of checkpoints, CD274 and CD47, on CTCs which camouflaged these cells from being detected by immune cells and corresponding apoptosis. Their results indicated that simultaneous administration of anti-CD274 antibody (also known as PD-L1 or B7-H1) and anti-CD47 checkpoints antibody can respectively block the signal of \u201cdon\u2019t find me\u201d for immune evasion and \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d for phagocytosis on CTCs. Thus, these combination shifts immune evasion to immune activation, which resulted in enhanced anti-tumor growth activity and reduced CTCs metastasis in 4 T1 tumor mouse model in vivo [153].",

The aptamer-conjugate impeded metastasis and displayed enhanced bio-stability against endogenous nucleases in vivo.

The production and release of exosomes from the tumor cells transmits a great deal of information with regards to the molecular and genetics properties, from the tumor cells to healthy ones or other abnormal cells residing nearby or at distant sites specifically designed to promote tumor invasion, metastasis and drug resistance [174]. That, bidirectional transport of exosomes containing different species of RNA (e.g. miRNA) and proteins between cancer stem cells and the fibroblast-rich microenvironment is shown to promote the growth of the tumor and the metastatic outbreak in breast carcinoma models [172]. Besides, exosomes are involved in acquired drug resistance, as evidenced by the observation that the transfer of the oncogene MET by exosomes modify surrounding icotinib-sensitive cells to promote icotinib-resistant lung cancer cells, that produce MET-containing exosomes and elicit the migration and invasion properties in vitro [175].",

The discovery of exosomes and uncoupling their roles has opened a new paradigm in understanding preferred cancer cell interactions. Now, new discoveries point to the role of exosomes as media for predicting organ-specific metastasis. In this perspective, exosomes from mouse and human lung-, brain- and liver-tropic tumor cells fuse preferentially with resident cells namely lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells, brain endothelial cells and liver Kupffer cells at their predicted destination. Furthermore, uptake of tumor-derived exosomes prepares organ-specific cells to serve as pre-metastatic niche. Notably, the injection of exosomes from lung-tropic models can redirect the metastasis of bone-tropic tumor cells. Moreover, these exosomes display differential integrin expression, and blockade of integrins \u03b1v\u03b25 and \u03b16\u03b24 dampen exosome uptake, as well as liver and lung metastasis, respectively. Finally, integrin-mediated uptake of exosome activates Src phosphorylation and pro-inflammatory S100 gene expression in resident cells [176].",

This formulation resulted in the deviation of ovarian tumor cells into the device, thereby capturing the cells and inhibiting further tumor metastasis [187]. Another interesting exosome-trapping system is reported that can specifically recognize, drag and dump blood-borne A549 lung cancer cell derived-oncogenic exosomes (A-Exo) into small intestine. In this design, EGFR-targeting aptamers coated on positively charged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN-AP) can specifically identify and bind negatively charged A-Exo. Nanoparticle-A-Exo conjugates can cross hepatobiliary layers and Oddi\u2019s sphincter into the small intestine, as validated by significant drop in circulatory A-exo, higher accumulation in the intestine and decreased lung metastasis in mice (Fig. 5) [188].\n",

Accordingly, exosome-producing cells can be fabricated to express and display transmembrane-anchored tumor-specific ligands on the surface of the exosome. In this regard, Limoni et al. fashioned exosomes conjugated with the chimeric protein against HER2+ cancer cells. To this, the transduction of HEK293T cells was performed by a lentiviral vector carrying-LAMP2b-DARPin G3 chimeric gene, where lysosomal associated membrane protein (LAMP) was served as anchoring chimerization with the ligand (DARPin for Her2 targeting) [189]. These exosomes delivered therapeutic siRNA into the targeted breast cancer cell lines resulting in 70% decrease in TPD52 gene expression in SKBR3 cells [190]. More recently, exosomes have also been targeted to deliver DOX to HER2+ cancer cells to evaluate the anticancer effects of DOX-loaded targeted exosomes in a murine tumor model. The results of this study indicate that targeted exosomes are favorably uptaken by HER2+ cells compared with HER2\u2212 cells and have the potential to be used as a competent drug delivery system [191].",

Intracellular contents are packaged into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies, thus bypassing unwanted inflammatory responses such as the release of self-antigens into the surroundings. Nuclear fragments that are not engulfed by apoptotic bodies act as self-antigen and are the source of the autoimmune system-related diseases, e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus [218\u2013220].",

Following the engulfment of apoptotic bodies by different cell types (macrophages, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, dendritic cells, and endothelial cells) subsequent internalization, devouring, and destruction of corpses occur in the lysosomes [221]. Since apoptotic cell engulfment could cause the generation of molecular memory by macrophages, apoptotic bodies are thought to accelerate intercellular communication via transferring cellular factors [222]. The entry of apoptotic bodies is thought to play important role in genetic alteration and diversity of the tumor cells. Further, the horizontal transfer of DNA might cause changes in the genetic information leading to malignancy [223]. Additionally, apoptotic bodies may also protect the circulating nucleic acids from enzymatic degradation [224].",

Such an effect action has also been described in conditioned medium from macrophages exposed to UV-killed cancer cells, which display TGF\u03b21-induced EMT inhibition, migration, and metastasis. Interestingly, apoptotic 344SQ (ApoSQ) cell-induced PPAR\u03b3 activity in macrophages was shown to increase the exosomal PTEN levels, which was further taken up by recipient lung cancer cells. In syngeneic immunocompetent mice, a single injection of ApoSQ cells can inhibit lung metastasis as reflected in enhanced PPAR\u03b3/PTEN signaling both in tumor cells and in TAMs. Thus, the injection of apoptotic cancer cells can be used as an additional therapeutic option against cancer in addition to other strategies for identifying and targeting tumor-related dead cells (Fig. 2h).",

Since anti-tumor immunity suppression is progressively tied to key metabolic pathways\u2019 activities and intratumoral metabolite levels in immune cells [227], the way by which CAF secretome could affect metabolism and immune cells function in the TME requires further investigation [228].",
