            "text": "Covid-19 appearance and fast spreading took by surprise the international community. Collaboration between researchers, public health workers and politicians has been established to deal with the epidemic. One important contribution from researchers in epidemiology is the analysis of trends so that both current state and short-term future trends can be carefully evaluated. Gompertz model has shown to correctly describe the dynamics of cumulative confirmed cases, since it is characterized by a decrease in growth rate that is able to show the effect of control measures. Thus, it provides a way to systematically quantify the Covid-19 spreading velocity. Moreover, it allows to carry out short-term predictions and long-term estimations that may facilitate policy decisions and the revision of in-place confinement measures and the development of new protocols. This model has been employed to fit the cumulative cases of Covid-19 from several Chinese provinces and from other countries with a successful containment of the disease. Results show that there are systematic differences in spreading velocity between countries. In countries that are in the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak, model predictions provide a reliable picture of its short-term evolution and may permit to unveil some characteristics of the long-term evolution. These predictions can also be generalized to short-term hospital and Intensive Care Units (ICU) requirements, which together with the equivalent predictions on mortality provide key information for health officials.",

When the 2 outbreak is caused by a new agent able to cause a pandemy, the challenge is even 3 greater and should involve the whole research community as well. Globalization plays 4 a double role in this context: on the one hand, it increases the risk for the outbreak to 5 evolve towards a pandemic; on the other hand, sharing of data and strategies enhance 6 the chance to control it. The new SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory 7 syndrome coronavirus 2) has put the international community at the edge of a global 8 disaster. National and local governments are working with public health agencies hand 9 with hand in order to slow down and, eventually, control the spread of Covid-19 [1] . 10 Daily availability of data about Covid-19 confirmed cases in different regions is a 11 unique opportunity for basic scientists to contribute on its control by carefully 12 analyzing dynamics and tends. In particular, mathematical models are widespread 13 and consolidated tools to extract information of data and help making predictions [2] . 14 Classic SIR and SEIR models (i.e., compartment models that divide a population into 15 Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Recovered) are being currently employed to 16 evaluate and predict the spreading of the epidemic episodes [3] . They have been 17 employed in the description for example of the Ebola epidemic on 1995 [4] and 2014 [5] 18 and in the more recent SARS epidemic on 2003 [6] among others. After the SARS 19 epidemic on 2003, in order to account the control efforts of the governments, some 20 modifications were introduced on the SEIR model to evaluate control measures [7, 8] . 21 Furthermore, the analysis of SEIR models have been already employed for the 22 modeling of the Covid-19 spreading in China in a effort to fit the characteristic 23 values [9, 10] . However, during the development of the epidemic, strong control 24 measures are luckily conditioning such dynamics and thus hindering the soundness of 25 this approach. Furthermore, SIR and SEIR models are regulated by the limitation of 26 the susceptible population, constrain, which in the case of Covid-19, seems to be 27 unnecessary [11] . 28 There is, however, another approach based on the phenomenological comparison of 29 the curve of cumulative cases with a typical function for growing processes. Evaluating 30 the trend of the curve during the last days, allows the future short-time behavior 31 tendency [12] . In fact, the use of a growing function has some important advantages. 32 Typically, the first growing function chosen is the Verhulst equation [13] which is the 33 solution of the logistic population model and the generalization of the model [14, 15] or 34 the Richards model [16] which have been employed in several epidemic spreading like 35 smallpox, influenza, Ebola, among others [14] . Some of these types of dynamical 36 phenomenological growth models to study epidemic outbreaks have been compared in 37 the initial phases of the Covid-19 epidemic for the short-term forecasting [17] . 38 A similar growth model is the Gompertz function [18] where the main difference is epidemic episodes [19, 20] [21] . The methodology and the results here discussed were 56 employed for the writting of daily reports [22] and the prediction of cases for hospitals 57 and intensive care units (ICUs).",

It is specially useful in situations where there is no deep knowledge of the 337 internal structure of the epidemics and when key properties of the epidemics are not 338 known. Precisely, the lack of knowledge regarding the different pathways of contagion 339 or its dependence on social measure makes the fitting of quantitative predictable 340 model impossible. Complex models with a lot of parameters to fit are, in this type of 341 epidemics, exercises trying to unveil possible scenarios, but never a real quantitative 342 tool. No model can predict the reaction of the population to a particular measure, nor 343 even properly assess the parameters of mobility when even basic immunity questions 344 remain unsolved. This is what makes our results about the large degree of confidence 345 in terms of short-term predictions of the evolution of the Covid-19 epidemics so 346 important. Our work has important ramifications since it can predict and, at the same 347 time, assess, changes in the dynamics of the pandemic. The prediction procedure 348 adapts to changes in any of the structural properties of the system. Changes in the 349 diagnose testing needed to detect a case, in social measures or in the way of counting 350 cases just introduce variation in the model that fade away as the new properties 351 emerge again. We have clearly shown in this paper that this changing structure is 352 properly captured with the decreasing nature of the growth given by parameters \u00b5 0 353 and a, and the final number of cases K. The highly complex and unknown nature of 354 key elements of the epidemics does not prevent us prediction its evolution in the 355",

While the Logistic equation produces a symmetric bell-shaped function for the new cases, the Gompertz model gives rise to an asymmetric function with a fast growth of new cases combined with a slow decrease which is more similar to the distribution of new cases observed in different countries during the spreading of some epidemic. We show in this manuscript that the asymmetric nature of the Gompertz model is the proper framework to study epidemics 49 where control measures are at the heart of its evolution since it captures the dynamic nature of the variation due to social distance measures.",
