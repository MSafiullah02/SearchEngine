Humanitarianism can be a form of virtue ethics but it also often a humanistic response to evident social problems. The ethos of humanitarianism is embedded in nearly all religions. In a humanitarian approach, people respond to human suffering and realise human fulfilment by acting in a virtuous manner based on compassion, empathy, or altruism. The virtues might be specific or broad. Examples of specific acts are charitable tithing among Baptists or zakat (charitable donations) among Muslims. Broadly proscribed virtues encompass such human qualities as generosity, honesty, trustworthiness, integrity, and fairness. Among the wealthy, these virtues might be expressed as philanthropy, which often focuses on health.4\n",

Health could be valued because it generates utility directly, or because good health is instrumental to other utility-generating states, including opulence, or both. Many contemporary health policies are based on a form of utilitarianism in which good health is valued as instrumental to maximising aggregate utility. For example, the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health calculated the costs and benefits of burdens of disease and argued that investing in health would generate economic growth, thereby enhancing incomes and aggregate utility.6\n",

It can show how improving the health of the deprived can be \u201cin everybody's interest\u201d\u2014including the self-interest of people not inclined to altruism. Its difficulties, however, are several. First, the instrumental valuation of health demeans it as an intrinsically valued goal in all societies. Second, people's self-assessments do not necessarily match their observed health status. For example, the self-reported morbidity rates in the Indian state of Kerala, where life expectancy is 70\u201375 years, are significantly higher than in Bihar, where life expectancy is significantly lower; and self-reported morbidity in the USA is higher still.7 Third, it is rather difficult, even theoretically, to aggregate very different kinds of utility together into a single entity.

Sen argues that equity in health should be assessed in terms of health capabilities and achievements rather than health-care activities. After all, health care is a human activity; what people actually value is the capability to attain good health. He further notes that equitable social processes should inform evaluations of equity in the health space. In some equity domains, such as gender, completely equal distribution of health achievement could be considered unfair because women\u2014whose lifespan in the absence of gender discrimination exceeds that of men\u2014should, under an equity framework, enjoy longer life expectancies.",

Equitable approaches to health have carried considerable power in mobilising support for health components of international development. Striking disparities in health achievement and emotively powerful arguments of preventable suffering can animate the public and political leaders. An example is the recent call for public funds to expand antiretroviral treatment to HIV-positive people in poor countries. The disparity between the health of those with access to life-saving drugs and the avoidable deaths among all others evokes the moral imperative to alleviate preventable human suffering caused by the inequitable access to antiretroviral drug therapy.",

Ensuring a minimal threshold of health might similarly fit well with humanitarianism and human rights, and equity and justice values will require action on behalf of the most disadvantaged.

Tuberculosis, especially multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, became recognised as a health crisis when it achieved rapid transmission in New York City. Yet tuberculosis\u2014before, during, and after the New York crisis\u2014kills 2 million people annually, most of whom are poor. Because of informational selectivity, tuberculosis is a silent crisis among the world's poor, invisible to the rich and powerful. Similarly, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) achieved front-page news because of its lethal nature and the paralysing effect it had on global commerce. Yet, \u201cSARS-like\u201d health catastrophes take place daily in thousands of rural villages in low-income countries.

Their aim seems to have been advocacy for certain types of health actions rather than for clarification of distinctive moral schools. De Cock21 argued that a public health rather than a human rights approach should frame responses to HIV/AIDS in Africa, but again this analysis is based on a very narrow example of both ethical schools. We argue that clarity in thinking is essential, because different moral schools do indeed raise distinct considerations and it can be useful to evaluate these carefully.

By contrast, he advocates an approach that \u201cenlists silence, on certain basic questions, as a device for producing convergence despite disagreement, uncertainty, limits of time and capacity, and heterogeneity\u201d. Sunstein's approach has the advantage of opening space for dialogue, exchange, and discussion, thereby promoting deliberative democracy, political accountability, and reason-giving. Incompletely theorised agreements satisfy diverse constituencies who might have very different reasons, including incompatible values, for supporting a particular activity.",

In the former case, the programme would invest heavily in building health clinics and outposts, and perhaps in increasing the ratio of medical personnel per citizen. This sounds very appealing until one recognises that a country may have many rural health outposts, and many doctors on salary role, but if these doctors do not turn up to work, and the outposts do not have adequate pharmaceutical supplies, the population's health outcomes might remain very poor. On the contrary, to achieve an equitable distribution of health outcomes it would be necessary to make sure that the investment in health care results in better health across the population. It would also then be necessary to address broader social determinants of health, such as that raised in Michael Marmot's24 intriguing research on the under-recognised relation between socioeconomic inequality and health.",

Such advertisements tend to view the poor as helpless victims, rather than people who could be empowered to care for themselves.

Yet this is only one of the ways in which moral values can support global health initiatives, and is not necessarily the most powerful. Discussions on whether to frame the objective of global health initiatives in terms of access to health care, or capabilities for good health, or utility maximisation, help to clarify what global health initiatives seek to accomplish. Criteria such as efficiency, or equitable treatment for men and women, clarify which alternative actions to realise similar goals should be selected. Consideration of how health activities contribute to or block non-health objectives such as the support of agency, or the rights to self-determination, clarify the importance of how health initiatives are carried forward. Thus global health may be far easier to achieve if we pause to follow through different moral analyses and thereby clarify what, which, and how global health initiatives can best proceed.",
