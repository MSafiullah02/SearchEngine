            "text": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) exhibits a Type I interferon (IFN) antagonistic function. This study characterizes Type I IFN antagonism mechanism of NS5 protein, using proteomic approach. In human neuroblastoma cells, NS5 expression would suppress IFN\u2424-induced responses, for example, expression of IFN-stimulated genes PKR and OAS as well as STAT1 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation. Proteomic analysis showed JEV NS5 downregulating calreticulin, while upregulating cyclophilin A, HSP 60 and stressinduced-phosphoprotein 1. Gene silence of calreticulin raised intracellular Ca 2+ levels while inhibiting nuclear translocalization of STAT1 and NFAT-1 in response to IFN\u2424, thus, indicating calreticulin downregulation linked with Type I IFN antagonism of JEV NS5 via activation of Ca 2+ /calicineurin. Calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A attenuated NS5-mediated inhibition of IFN\u2424-induced responses, for example, IFN-sensitive response element driven luciferase, STAT1-dependent PKR mRNA expression, as well as phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1. Transfection with calcineurin (vs. control) siRNA enhanced nuclear translocalization of STAT1 and upregulated PKR expression in NS5-expressing cells in response to IFN\u2424. Results prove Ca 2+ , calreticulin, and calcineurin involvement in STAT1-mediated signaling as well as a key role of JEV NS5 in Type I IFN antagonism. This study offers insights into the molecular mechanism of Type I interferon antagonism by JEV NS5.",

Two peptide peaks of thioredoxin (Spot ID 10) with a MASCOT score of 86 and sequence coverage of 19% in MS analysis were sequenced by Q-TOF MS analysis and identified to match within thioredoxin residues 86-94 and 98-105 ( Fig. 3B and C) . Lysates of both cells treated with varied IFN\u2424 concentrations were analyzed by Western blot with monoclonal antibodies against cyclophilin A and calreticulin (Fig. 3D) , indicating IFN\u2424 treatment increased 18-kDa immuno-reactive bands as cyclophilin A in NS5-expressing, but not vector control cells. On the other hand, IFN\u2424 treatment slightly reduced protein levels of calreticulin in NS5expressing compared to vector control cells.

Intracellular Ca 2+ levels in cells transfected with both control and calreticulin siRNA were stained with FLUO3/AM, then analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 4A) . Intracellular Ca 2+ levels were 4.9-fold higher in NS5-expressing than vector control cells posttransit transfection with control siRNA. Importantly, calreticulin silence by siRNA caused sharp (1.8-and 5.5-fold) increase of Ca 2+ levels in NS5-expressing and vector control cells, respectively. Immunofluorescent analysis indicated IFN\u2424 treatment increasing expression and nuclear localization of STAT1 in vector controls transfected with control siRNA; calreticulin silence decreased STAT1 in nuclei of vector controls (Fig. 4B) . By contrast, NS5 expressing cells with or without calreticulin silence showed no significant change of expression and subcellular localization of STAT1 in response to IFN\u2424 (Fig. 4C) . To elucidate effect of calreticulin silence on calcineurin-NFAT signaling, NFAT-1 nuclear localization in both types of cells was analyzed by immunofluorescent staining with anti-NFAT-1 antibodies ( Fig. 4D and E). IFN\u2424 treatment induced nuclear translocalization of NFAT-1 in vector controls; calreticulin silence definitely reduced NFAT-1 nuclear localization in response to IFN\u2424, indicating downregulation and gene silence of calreticulin linked with increase of intracellular Ca 2+ and reduction of STAT1 and NFAT-1 nuclear localization, as well as activating Ca 2+calcineurin-NFAT signaling.",

Combined treatment of IFN\u2424 and CsA induced death of both cell types, implying that calcineurin inhibition by CsA attenuates IFN\u2424 antagonistic activity of JEV NS5 protein. In dual-luciferase reporter system, single CsA treatment activated ISRE-driven promoter in NS5-expressing cells, not vector controls (Fig. 5B) . Combined treatment of CsA and IFN\u2424 induced higher ISRE-driven promoter activity than single CsA or IFN\u2424 treatment in NS5-expressing cells (Fig. 5B ). Single CsA treatment had no effect on ISRE-driven promoter activity in vector controls; combined treatment of CsA and IFN\u2424 showed less ISRE-driven promoter activity than single IFN\u2424 treatment in vector controls. Transcriptional factor IRF-3 bonded with ISRE of ISG15 promoter, then directly induced ISG15 mRNA expression, while STAT1 was involved in PKR gene regulation [33, 34] . To analyze association of IRF-3 and STAT1 with CsA effect on activation of ISRE-driven promoter, relative mRNA fold change of IRF-3 dependent gene ISG15 and STAT1 dependent gene PKR was quantified by real-time PCR. Single IFN\u2424 treatment induced 20.7-fold upregulation of PKR mRNA in vector controls, only 4.7-fold increase in NS5-expressing cells. Combined treatment of CsA and IFN\u2424 had a similar level of PKR mRNA in vector control cells; PKR mRNA expression rose by 9.1-fold in NS5-expressing cells (Fig. 5C ). Relative PKR mRNA fold change indicated similar pattern as ISRE-driven promoter activity in response to single or combined treatment ( Fig. 5B and C) . Single IFN\u2424 treatment raised mRNA levels of ISG15 in NS5-expressing cells more than in vector controls; combined treatment with CsA and IFN\u2424 upregulated ISG15 mRNA expression, similar to single IFN\u2424 treatment (Fig. 5D) .

Silencing of calcineurin significantly increased STAT1 nuclear translocalization in NS5-expressing cells stimulated by IFN\u2424. Control siRNA did not reduce Type I IFN antagonistic activity of JEV NS5 (Fig. 7B) ; calcineurin silence induced twofold increase of PKR mRNA over control siRNA in NS5-expressing cells stimulated by IFN\u2424 (Fig. 7C) . Calcineurin-dependent expression of IL-4 was tested in NS5-expressing and vector control cells (Fig. 7D ). Due to calcineurin activation by JEV NS5 (Figs. 5 and 6) , relative IL-4 mRNA level in NS5-expressing cells was nearly 50% higher than vector controls in response to IFN\u2424 (Fig. 7D) . siRNA silencing of calcineurin significantly decreased IL-4 mRNA in both types of cells, even stimulated with IFN\u2424. Results confirmed activation of Ca 2+ /calcineurin signaling as a critical mechanism of Type I IFN antagonism by JEV NS5.",

            "text": "JEV induces no Type I IFN response (vital to pathogenesis) in cell culture. This study dealt with JEV NS5, previously reported as antagonistic toward members of Type I IFN pathway. We first demonstrated that JEV NS5 expression in human medulloblastoma cells inhibits (a) IFN\u2424-induced ISRE promoter activities, (b) IFN\u2424-stimulated gene expression, and (c) suppression of IFN\u2424-induced nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of STAT1 (Fig. 2 ). Significant suppression of STAT1 phosphorylation at Tyr701 was responsible for Type I IFN antagonism of JEV NS5 proteins, in agreement with prior studies: WNV and TBEV NS5 proteins suppressing tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and DEN NS5 protein suppressing tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2, blocking formation of STAT1/STAT1 homo-or heterodimers in Type I IFN-induced JAK/STAT signaling pathway [8, [10] [11] [12] [13] 35] . Recently, interaction of TBEV NS5 with PDZ protein scribble (hScrib) was associated with JAK-STAT interference, vital for an antagonist of IFN response [15] . Proteomics approach to identify NS5-induced protein profiling indicated downregulation of calreticulin plus upregulation of cyclophilin A, Hsp60, and STIP1, as linked with activation of calcineurin (Fig. 3 , Table 1 ), suggesting the key of host cellular factors in Type I IFN antagonistic function of JEV NS5 protein. Calreticulin is a Ca 2+ -binding chaperone in ER, as a key upstream regulator of calcineurin in Ca 2+ -signaling cascade [36] . NS5 downregulated Ca 2+ -binding chaperone calreticulin, confirmed by Western blot and quantitative realtime PCR (Fig. 3D and E) , as correlating with increased release of Ca 2+ from ER into cytosol (Fig. 4A) , as well as gene silencing of calreticulin raising intracellular Ca 2+ levels in controls. Promoter of human calreticulin gene comprised AP-1, Sp1, and H4TF-1 sites, plus four CCAAT sequences, binding with c-Jun/c-Fos, specific protein 1 (Sp1), H4TF-1, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein transcriptional factors [37, 38] regulated by p38 MAPK and ERK1/2. Western blot indicated JEV NS5 protein suppressing phosphorylated levels of ERK1/2, not p38 MAPK, in response to IFN\u2424 (Supporting Information Fig. 3) ; JEV NS5 protein affects transcriptional activation of calreticulin promoter by reducing ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Downregulation and siRNA-mediated silence of calreticulin reduced the nuclear translocalization of NFAT-1 in response to IFN\u2424 (Fig. 4D and E) , indicating activation of calcineurin by calreticulin downregulation and silence. Among upregulated proteins, cyclophilin A is involved in virus replication and virion maturation [39] , significantly interacting with calcineurin and inhibited its phosphatase activity in the presence of CsA [40, 41] . Hsp60 is one calcineurin-interacting protein [42] . STIP1, an Hsp70/ Hsp90-organizing protein, as a cochaperone binds to both Hsp70/Hsp90, correlated with calcineurin regulation [43] . SARS-CoV NSP1 overexpression strongly induced production of interleukin 2 by activating calcineurin/NFAT pathway; calcineurin inhibitor CspA strongly inhibited pan-coronavirus replication in vitro [41] . Proteomics results and the above literature survey led us to hypothesize calcineurin as involved in Type I IFN antagonism of JEV NS5. Because induction of ISG15 was IRF-3-dependent, PKR expression is STAT1-dependent in response to Type I IFN [33, 34] , IFN\u2424 upregulated expression of ISG15, but not PKR in NS5-expressing cells (Fig. 5C and D) , implying NS5 specifically inhibited STAT1-mediated signaling. Combined CsA and IFN\u2424 treatment as well as siRNA-mediated calcineurin silence restored IFN\u2424-induced STAT1-mediated responses in NS5-expressing cells, for example., PKR mRNA expression, STAT1 phosphrylation at Tyr701, nuclear translocation of STAT1 (Figs. 5-7) . These affirm Type I IFN antagonism of JEV NS5 correlating with downregulation of calreticulin in which activated Ca 2+ -dependent calcineurin phosphatase inhibits STAT1-mediated signaling. HBV-induced upregulation of calreticulin was identified as antagonizing Type I IFN responses: inhibiting STAT1 phosphorylation and reducing PKR mRNA expression [44] . Calreticulin, an ER Ca 2+ -binding chaperone, might be involved in viral pathogenesis, offering a potential target for development of antiviral agents.",

Interestingly, single treatment with CsA slightly induced ISRE-driven promoter activation, STAT1 nuclear translocation in both cell types, and inhibition of JEV replication in vitro by 4.3-fold (Figs. 5B, 6B and C, and 8B). This indicated inhibition of calreticulin/calcineurin pathway by CsA eliciting antiviral innate immune responses. CsA with distinct immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory mechanisms from IFN antiviral mechanisms sharply reduced IFN antagonistic function of JEV NS5 via inactivation of calcineurin-mediated pathways. Single and combined treatment of CspA analogs and IFNs should be further tested in vitro and in vivo for evaluating antiviral efficacy.",

Replication of WNV, DEN, and YF viruses in cyclophilin A knockdown cells was less efficient; transsupplying of wild peptidyl-prolyl isomerases domain of cyclophilin A rescued viral replication in cyclophilin A knockdown cells [35] . In HCV replication complex, cyclophilin A was recruited to maintain optimal conformation between RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and template binding [45] . A chaperone system was likewise required for viral replication assembly and RNA binding, for example, interaction of HSP 90 with herpes simplex virus Type 1 polymerase [46] and hepatitis B virus reverse transcriptase [47] . Cyclophilin A was suggested as a molecular chaperone to keep flavivirus replication complexes in active conformation. In our laboratory, coimmunoprecipitation assays also proved direct interaction of JEV NS5 with cyclophilin A (data not shown). Likewise, overexpression of cyclophilin A induced IFN\u2424 production, linked with suppressed rotavirus replication via activation of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases independent but JNK-dependent signaling [48] . Cyclophilin A could thus be crucial for maintaining JEV NS5 functional structure.",
