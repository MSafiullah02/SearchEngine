Recommendations exist for general airway management procedures (including tracheal intubation, bag-mask ventilation, and laryngeal mask insertion) in patients suspected of, or infected with SAR-CoV-218,19 (Table 1). Several of these recommendations also highlight the importance of teamwork, preparation, communication, and safety verifications in addition to procedural approaches20. Use of novel devices for airway management, such as barrier enclosures (ie, boxes, drapes) may help to limit aerosolization during intubation, extubation, and/or with use of oxygen delivery devices (Fig. 1). Yet they still remain unproven and may introduce challenges, such as limited range of motion or impaired visualization21,22. Further investigation is needed to define the role of such devices.",

If a nebulized solution of local anesthetic is used for topicalization, this can theoretically cause aerosolization and may compound the risk of infection to health care providers26. The perceived risk of nebulizers is not universally accepted, and previous studies performed during the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak did not link the use of nebulizers to the transmission of infection23,27. Nonetheless, the procedure can cause gagging and coughing, which increases the risk of the droplet and aerosol spread. Flexible laryngoscopy by surgical providers is similarly considered to be a high risk28. Given these risks, current guidance from the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation recommends avoiding awake endoscopic (fiberoptic) intubation in patients with suspected coronavirus (SAR-CoV-2) infection, unless specifically indicated19.",

During the pandemic, we recommend against jet ventilation for rescue in a cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate event. In such instances, a scalpel bougie technique is preferred to aerosolization without a secured cuffed tube. Also for laryngotracheal procedures, consideration should be made for intermittent apnea techniques that permit mechanical ventilation through a closed airway circuit.

Nonetheless, HFNO has been utilized in many intensive care units, based on the premise that it may obviate the need for intubation in some patients; this stance continues to be debated33,38,39. If HFNO is used, the patient should ideally be placed in a negative pressure environment; although devices that limit aerosolization or distribution are also an option40. Prior investigation with HFNO in simulation did not find it to increase the risk of droplet and contact infection34, however, in the operating room, intermittent apnea should be utilized over apneic oxygenation via HFNO whenever possible. If HFNO is utilized, facemask protection should be placed on the patient to limit aerosolization. In patients with COVID-19 and severe respiratory compromise, the use of HFNO to maintain apneic oxygenation is unlikely to be as effective as in healthy patients41,42.",

On the basis of these presented cases and reviewed reports, the American Academy of Otolaryngology\u2014Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS reference) recommended that endoscopic transnasal surgery should only be performed for urgent/emergent needs. If preoperative COVID-19 testing is performed and the patient is found to be positive, surgery should be delayed until the infection is cleared. In addition, given the possibility of false negatives and risk with surgery, respiratory PPE should universally be utilized for these cases.",

As an AGP, tracheostomy timing aims to minimize risk of viral exposure by considering timing, procedural approaches, and use of PPE. Tracheostomy should not be performed in patients with unstable pulmonary status nor sooner than 10\u201321 days weeks from initial intubation, preferably once the viral load has decreased (viral RNA can sometimes be detected by PCR for up to 20 days from symptom onset; however, the immune response is often activated and this virus is typically culture negative at these later time points). In addition, clinicians should bear in mind that days intubated will usually underestimate the duration elapsed since infection45. Still, there is a lack of high-quality data on the degree of aerosolization with open versus percutaneous tracheostomy techniques. Several recommendations are considered important to optimize success and patient and provider safety during tracheostomy procedures (Table 4)52.",

In a review of the 2009 Influenza A Pandemic (H1N1), the CDC recommended that providers involved in AGP wear at a minimum an N95 respirator and may consider a powered air-purifying system (PAPR). The PAPR was shown to provide 2.5\u2013100 times greater protection than the N9553. The N95 efficacy is limited by the potential for face seal leakage, which is not always predicted by fit testing. Following the SARS-CoV-1 outbreaks in 2003, it was found that 9% of health care workers that intubated patients contracted SARS54, suggesting that aggressive measures were required to protect health care workers from the viral transmission. The PAPR system is not without drawbacks as it requires appropriate assembly, maintenance, donning, doffing, and handling once it enters into the care setting and becomes contaminated. It may also limit hearing and communication, interfering with procedures. Regardless of the choice of respirator used, appropriate training and handling to prevent contamination are key to optimize its efficacy.",

Antibody tests have been positive in 90% of infected individuals by 11\u201324 days after infection61,62.

Despite improvements in serological detection, a further consideration is that the degree and duration of protection afforded through immunity after infection with SARS-CoV-2 remain uncertain56,63. While COVID-19 infection remains prevalent, testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals is advisable before proceeding with head and neck surgical procedures.
