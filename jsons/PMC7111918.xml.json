He observed that mice inoculated with murine leukemia virus not only developed leukemia, but also adenocarcinomas of the parotid gland (Gross, 1953). Newborn mice injected with extracts of parotid gland cancer tissue developed a variety of solid tumors. Because of this property, the new infectious agent was originally named murine SE polyomavirus after the Greek for many (poly) for and cancer (oma) (Stewart et al., 1957).",

So far, no polyomavirus infections have been recognized in fish, amphibians or reptiles, although polyomaviruses-like particles have been observed in these species, and the genome of a virus infecting the Japanese eel contains one open reading frame that shows homology to polyomavirus LT-ag (Essbauer and Ahne, 2001, Mizutani et al., 2011). Eight genuine human polyomaviruses (HPyV) have been described so far: BKPyV, JCPyV, KIPyV, WUPyV, Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV), HPyV6, HPyV7, trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus (TSPyV), and HPyV9 (Allander et al., 2007, Gardner et al., 1971; Gaynor et al., 2007; Padgett et al., 1971, Feng et al., 2008, Schowalter et al., 2010, Scuda et al., 2011, van der Meijden et al., 2010). HPyVs seem to be harmless in immunocompetent individuals, but have been associated with nephropathy (BKPyV), PML (JCPyV), and trichodysplasia spinulosa (TSPyV) in immunocompromised patients and with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCPyV) (Brew et al., 2010, Hirsch and Steiger, 2003, Feng et al., 2008, van der Meijden et al., 2010).",

The resulting LT- and st-ag proteins are involved in viral DNA replication and transcription (Gjoerup and Chang, 2010, Moens et al., 2007). Two major late transcripts encode the capsid proteins; one of the transcripts is translated into VP1, while the other gives rise to VP2 and VP3 by using two different start codons (Imperiale and Major, 2007).",

One of these polypeptides was first identified in the SV40 genome and is encoded by an open reading frame upstream of the genes for the capsid proteins. Because the existence of this gene product could not be demonstrated at first, this gene was referred to as agnogene and its putative 66 amino acids protein as agnoprotein (derived from the Greek \u201cagnosis\u201d meaning without knowledge) (Jay et al., 1981). Later studies confirmed the existence of the SV40 agnoprotein and expression of agnoprotein or the presence of a putative agnogene has been described for several other polyomaviruses (Table 1). This review will elaborate on the structure and function of agnoprotein and will discuss the importance of this protein for polyomaviruses.",

BKPyV and JCPyV agnoproteins display high similarities with the SV40 agnoprotein, especially in the N-terminal region (\nFig. 1). In contrast, none of the recently detected human polyomaviruses KI, WU, MCPyV, HPyV 6, HPyV7, TSPyV, and HPyV9 seem to encode agnoprotein (Allander et al., 2007, Feng et al., 2008; Gaynor et al., 2007; Schowalter et al., 2010, Scuda et al., 2011, van der Meijden et al., 2010). Some other mammalian polyomaviruses encode agnoprotein (Table 1). The late region of Avipolyomavirus genomes encode a fourth protein that was originally designated as agnoprotein (Johne and M\u00fcller, 2001). However, this structural protein is present in the virion and has no functional homology to the agnoprotein of mammalian polyomaviruses and is therefore currently referred to as VP4 (Johne and M\u00fcller, 2001).",

For BKV and JCV, phosphoacceptor sites have been mapped to Ser-7, Ser-11, and Thr-21 (Johannessen et al., 2008, Sariyer et al., 2006). Ser-7 and Ser-11 are also conserved in SV40, SV40 Ri257 and SA12 agnoprotein, while Thr-21 is conserved in SA12 agnoprotein, and replaced by Ser-21 in SV40 agnoprotein. BKPyV, JCPyV, SV40, SV40 Ri257 and SA12 contain a conserved Ser or Thr at position 45 (44 in SV40 Ri257), but the in vivo functionality of this phosphoacceptor site is not known. Agnoproteins encoded by other non-human polyomaviruses also contain putative phosphoacceptor sites, e.g., agnoproteins of the chimpanzee polyomavirus strains Ta, Az and Bob comprise conserved Thr-3, Ser-15, Ser-20, Thr-26, Ser-32, Thr-44, Thr-46/48, and Ser-53/55 (\nTable 3).

Replacing Ser-11 with either non-phosphorylatable alanine or phospho-mimicking aspartic acid in BKPyV agnoprotein reduced the ability of these mutants to propagate compared to wild-type virus (Johannessen et al., 2008). JCPyV DNA encoding an agnoprotein in which Ser-7 was replaced with Leu or Ser-11 with Phe has been amplified from single patients in Russia and Ethiopia, respectively (GenBank accession numbers BAB93095.1 and BAE02911.1, respectively). A BKPyV isolate with deletion of residues 9\u201312 (removing Ser-11) has also been reported (Chen et al., 2004). These findings may indicate that virus genomes carrying mutations affecting these phosphoacceptor sites can still sustain viral replication. However, since the agnogene sequences were amplified by PCR, it is not known whether actual infectious virus particles were present in the human samples or whether viral DNA was released from dead cells. Alternatively, several viral strains may circulate in the same patient and strains that express wild-type agnoprotein can rescue strains expressing the phosphoagnoprotein mutants. Indeed, it has been shown that agnoprotein in trans can rescue propagation of SV40 and BKPyV strains that do not express agnoproteins in cell culture (Carswell et al., 1986, Myhre et al., 2010).",

Expression levels of single T21A, double S7A/S11A, and triple S7A/S11A/T21A mutant proteins were higher than those of wild-type JCPyV agnoprotein, whereas BKPyV S11A agnoprotein was less stable than wild-type or the phosphomimicking S11D mutant protein (Johannessen et al., 2008, Sariyer et al., 2006). Results from both studies suggest that agnoprotein degradation is modulated by residue-specific phosphorylation. Sariyer et al. did not examine the stability of JCPyV S11A agnoprotein, but phosphorylation of Ser-11 may increase the stability of agnoprotein, while phosphorylation of Ser-7 and Thr-21 may trigger degradation. Phosphorylation of a substrate can stimulate its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome (Hunter, 2007). It is not known whether phosphorylation of agnoprotein leads to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, but in silico prediction algorithms of ubiquitin-conjugated sites show that agnoproteins of different polyomaviruses contain putative lysine ubiquitin acceptor residues (Table 3, (Lee et al., 2011; Tung and Ho, 2008)).",

Saribas and colleagues demonstrated that the amino acids spanning from 17 to 42 are absolutely required for JCPyV agnoprotein oligmerization (Saribas et al., in press). This region is extremely well-conserved in BKPyV, SV40, SA12 agnoprotein, suggesting that this domain may also be involved in oligomerization of these proteins. Interestingly, viral particles were efficiently released from SVG-A cells transfected with JCPyV DNA lacking the nucleotides encoding amino acids 17\u201342 of agnoprotein, but were mostly deficient in DNA content (Saribas et al., in press). SV40 mutants with deletions in agnoprotein removing this oligomerization domain replicated less efficiently than wild-type virus (Barkan and Mertz, 1981). These results suggest that agnoprotein dimerization/oligomerization is implicated in viral encapsidation of JCPyV DNA. The exact residues necessary for oligomerization have not been mapped, but JCPyV, BKPyV and SV40 strains with specific amino acid substitutions in the 17\u201342 region have been isolated (see Table S1), indicating that these residues may not be involved in agnoprotein oligomerization. It is, however, likely that several amino acids are required such that one single substitution will not abrogate agnoprotein oligomerization.",

Experimental studies demonstrated that agnoprotein resides mainly in the cytoplasm and perinuclear region, although a minor fraction is also detectable in the nucleus (Carswell et al., 1986, Endo et al., 2003, Johannessen et al., 2008, Myhre et al., 2010, Nomura et al., 1983, Okada et al., 2001). The agnoproteins of BKPyV, JCPyV, SV40, and SA12 contain a putative Leu-rich nuclear export signal (NES) in the central region of the protein and a stretch of basic amino acids (R or K) which may represent a classic nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Fig. 1, (Fu et al., 2011; Lange et al., 2007)). Chimpanzee agnoprotein possesses a bipartite motif (RRRRX5RX4RK) with two stretches of basic amino acids, while the N-terminal regions of MyPyV, squirrel PyV and sea lion PyV agnoproteins are R/K-rich. A putative NES motif is lacking in agnoproteins of the latter. Studies with agnoprotein mutants in the NES are required to confirm the functionality of this motif.",

On the monolayers of such droplets, proteins (e.g., caveolin-1) accumulate which lend structure and attribute a particular function to the droplet (Brown, 2001).

The physical interaction of JCPyV agnoprotein with LT-ag downregulates both LT-ag mediated viral gene expression and DNA replication (Safak et al., 2001). At the late stage of viral infection, expression and replication of the viral genome has to cease in order to prevent disproportionate production of genome copies and capsid proteins and to optimize efficient assembly (Safak et al., 2001). JCPyV agnoprotein was shown to interact directly with PP2A, which required agnoprotein residues 18\u201336 (Sariyer et al., 2008). PP2A dephosphorylated PKC-phosphorylated agnoprotein. The authors demonstrated that JCPyV agnoprotein also binds st-ag, but the agnoprotein domain necessary for interaction with st-ag was not mapped, implying that is not known whether PP2A and st-ag can bind their common substrate simultaneously or in a mutually exclusive manner. However, dephosphorylation of agnoprotein by PP2A was a result of st-ag-mediated inhibition PP2A, rather than st-ag preventing PP2A to bind to agnoprotein. JCPyV deficient in st-ag or encoding st-ag lacking its unique C-terminal domain (and thus the PP2A binding region) are replication incompetent (Sariyer et al., 2008, Bollag et al., 2010). JCPyV genomes encoding agnoproteins in which the PKC phosphoacceptor sites Ser-7, Ser-11, and Thr-21 were substituted by non-phosphorylatable Ala were also severely impaired with respect to replication (Sariyer et al., 2006, Sariyer et al., 2008). siRNA-mediated depletion of PP2A strongly reduced JCPyV replication in SVG-A cells and reduced agnoprotein levels (Sariyer et al., 2008). All these observations illustrate the biological importance of the PP2A:st-ag:agnoprotein link for the viral life cycle.",

Depending on the relative concentration of st-ag, PP2A, and agnoprotein, different complexes can be envisaged during the viral life cycle. This will affect the phosphorylation states of agnoprotein in a time-dependent manner. During the early phase of infection, there will be an excess of st-ag compared to agnoprotein and hence st-ag will predominantly bind and inactivate PP2A. This will impede PP2A-mediated dephosphorylation of agnoprotein. As the viral life cycle of PyV progresses, more agnoprotein will be synthesized, such that the likelihood to form agnoprotein:st-ag complexes is increased. This will prevent st-ag from binding and inactivating PP2A. As a result, PP2A may dephosphorylate agnoprotein. Strikingly, viral proteins of both RNA and DNA viruses have been shown to physically interact with PP2A and interfere with cell proliferation and survival. While HIV-1 Vpr, Adenovirus E4orf, and hepatitis C virus NS5A proteins induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by binding PP2A (Georgopoulou et al., 2006, Li et al., 2009, Godet et al., 2010), PP2A inactivation by Epstein-Barr virus EBNA-LP protects against apoptosis (Garibal et al., 2007). HTLV-I Tax and HPV E7 protein also binds and inactivates PP2A, but the biological consequences for the viral life cycle remain unknown (Pim et al., 2005, Hong et al., 2007).",

One of these is heterochromatin protein 1\u03b1 (HP1\u03b1). The nuclear envelope is composed of an inner and outer lipid layer spiked with several proteins. The inner nuclear membrane is connected to the nuclear lamina, which is composed of lamins A, B1, B2 and C. The lamin B receptor is a part of the inner nuclear membrane and binds HP1\u03b1. This interaction is thought to contribute to the reassembly of the nuclear envelope after cell division (Stewart et al., 2007). The N-terminal region of JCPyV agnoprotein can associate with HP1\u03b1, resulting in dissociation of HP1\u03b1 from the lamin B receptor. This alters the nuclear envelope and facilitates nuclear release of progeny virus particles (Okada et al., 2005). Although the N-terminal region is 90% identical with BKPyV agnoprotein, no co-localization with HP1\u03b1 in primary human renal tubule epithelial cells was observed (Myhre et al., 2010, Unterstab et al., 2010). This may indicate that the JCPyV agnoprotein amino acid residues critical for the interaction with HP1\u03b1 are not conserved in BKPyV agnoprotein.",

Interestingly, JCPyV agnoprotein co-localizes with the cytoskeletal protein tubulin, which oligomerizes to form microtubules.

Hence, agnoprotein operates to shut off viral expression by targeting YB-1. The authors also demonstrated that YB-1, which is predominantly found in the cytoplasm in uninfected SVG-A cells, translocates to the nucleus during viral infection (Safak et al., 2002). Interestingly, the nuclear YB-1 concentration increased as viral life cycle proceeded, and decreased as the infection cycle approached its termination (Safak et al., 2002).

            "text": "Changes in agnoprotein expression affect the expression of other viral proteins. Deletions in SV40 agnogene, removal of the complete JCPyV agnogene or mutation of its start codon (the tetranucleotide CATG spanning the agnoprotein start codon was converted into TCGA) all caused a drop in the levels of VP1 and LT-ag (Barkan et al., 1987, Akan et al., 2006). Akan and co-workers argued that the agnogene contains critical cis-acting DNA elements to which transcription factors bind and regulate viral gene expression. Hence, deletion of the agnogene might remove these binding sites and affect transcription of the LT-ag and VP1 genes. However, as changing the tetranucleotide sequence CATG into TCGA will not destroy as many putative transcription binding sites as deleting the whole agnogene, it is possible that agnoprotein itself can affect the expression levels of LT-ag. How the lack of agnoprotein influences the expression of LT-ag is not completely understood, but it could be at the transcriptional level (e.g., agnoprotein interferes with the proteins involved in transcribing the early genes) or at the post-transcriptional level (e.g., agnoprotein affects the stability of LT-ag). Another mechanism by which agnogene DNA sequences can modulate the expression of VP1 is at the post-transcriptional level by acting as an upstream ORF (uORF). Several groups have shown that the synthesis of some proteins can be modulated in part by translation of uORF encoded within the leader region of mRNA (Geballe and Sachs, 2000, Morris and Geballe, 2000). Similarly, the coding sequence of agnoprotein may act as an uORF that controls the translation rate of VP1 and hence the amount of VP1 synthesized in infected cells. Indeed, Three groups independently observed higher intracellular protein levels of VP1 in cells infected with SV40, JCPyV or BKPyV mutants in which the translation initiation codon of agnoprotein was destroyed than in cells challenged with wild-type virus (Johannessen et al., 2008, Sedman et al., 1989, Suzuki et al., 2010). This indicates that the agnoprotein ORF reduces the translation of the downstream ORF VP1.",

            "text": "Agnoprotein is expressed during later stages of viral infection and it can therefore be assumed that it is involved in completing the viral life cycle by stimulating viral maturation and/or viral release. Although the exact function of agnoprotein remains unresolved, several findings indicate that this protein is implicated in viral maturation and release. First, cells infected with SV40 agnoprotein deficient mutants displayed an abnormal nuclear localization of VP1. Agnoprotein was shown to facilitate the perinuclear-nuclear localization of VP1 (Carswell and Alwine, 1986, Resnick and Shenk, 1986). Transfection of cells with mutant SV40 or JCPyV genomes unable to express agnoprotein due to mutation of their ATG codon results in the release of progeny virions deficient in DNA content (Resnick and Shenk, 1986, Sariyer et al., 2006, Suzuki et al., 2010). Viral early and late protein expression and viral DNA replication are reduced compared to cells transfected with wild-type SV40 or JCPyV DNA. Expression of agnoprotein in trans restored viral expression and replication (Myhre et al., 2010, Sariyer et al., 2011). Vero cells transfected with the genome of a mutant BKPyV strain Dunlop that does not express agnoprotein can still produce infectious virus particles, although less efficiently than wild-type virus (Johannessen et al., 2008). On the other hand, Vero cells transfected with recombinant BKPyV Dunlop genome in which the non-coding region was replaced with non-coding regions of isolates from renal transplant patients were unable to produce infectious virions (Myhre et al., 2010). The NCCRs of these clinical BKPyV isolates were rearranged and had large deletions in the 5'end of the agnogene. The recombinant viral genomes expressed VP1, but not agnoprotein and after transfection, they produced virus-like particles in the nucleus which were not released from the cell. When released by artificial lysis of the cells these virus-like particles turned out to be non-infectious (Myhre et al., 2010). Deletion of JCPyV agnoprotein still resulted in efficient release of virus-like particles from SVG-A transfected cells (Sariyer et al., 2011), while Suzuki and colleagues, using the same cells, observed a strong decrease in the release of virus particles (Suzuki et al., 2010). The reason why some groups find that cells transfected JCPyV and BKPyV genomes not encoding agnoprotein release virus particles, while other investigators cannot, remains unclear.",

            "text": "Viruses such as poliovirus, rotavirus, HIV-1, HTLV-I, influenzavirus, Coronavirus, Sindbis virus, SARS and Bluetongue all encode proteins that promote release of progeny virions. These proteins, referred to as viroporins, are small (60\u2013120 amino acids) proteins that possess at least one hydrophobic transmembrane domain able to form an amphipatic \u03b1-helix (Gonzalez and Carrasco, 2003). The Sawa group showed that JCPyV agnoprotein acts as a viroporin that enhances viral release. Amino acids 8 (R) and 9 (K) were crucial for viroporin activity (Suzuki et al., 2010). This N-terminal RK motif is conserved in the agnoprotein of squirrel polyomavirus (residues 3 and 4 and residues 8 and 9) and of bovine polyomavirus (residues 11 and 12), but not in the closely related BKPyV, SV40 and SA12 (Fig. 1). Another group showed that SV40 VP4, a protein encoded by an internal open reading frame in the VP2/VP3 coding sequence, acts as a viroporin (Raghava et al., 2011). Both JCPyV and BKPyV have a putative VP4 ORF, but the expression of this protein has not been demonstrated. The other human polyomaviruses that do not express an agnoprotein also lack this VP4 ORF (Van Ghelue et al., in press). In addition to its viroporin function, the viroporins Vpu of HIV-1 and M2 of influenza virus impair the secretory pathway (Henkel et al., 2000, Tokarev and Guatelli, 2011). Similarly, BKPyV agnoprotein also interferes with secretion through its interaction with \u03b1-SNAP (Johannessen et al., 2011).",

Stable expression of agnoprotein in the rat oligodendrocyte cell line CG4-OI compromised the release of chemokine CXCL5/LIX, and to a lesser extent IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and Fractalkine. Neurons treated with conditioned medium from CG4-OI cells displayed a higher survival rate than cells challenged with medium from agnoprotein-expressing CG4-OI cells. Treatment of neurons with conditioned medium from agnoprotein-expressing CG4-OI cells induced apoptosis and was associated with activation of the p38MAPK and GSK3\u03b2 pathways, while the ERK1/2 pathway was inhibited (Merabova et al., 2011). The mechanism responsible for reduced CXCL5/LIX levels in medium of agnoprotein-expressing CG4-OI cells was not examined, but may result from agnoprotein's ability to interfere with transcription (Khalili et al., 2005, Johannessen et al., 2008). JCPyV agnoprotein may also compromise secretion of CXCL5/LIX through interference with intracellular transport as was shown for BKPyV agnoprotein through interaction with \u03b1-SNAP (Johannessen et al., 2011).",

The dermotropic MCPyV, HPyV6, HPyV7, and TSPyV do not encode agnoprotein. In accordance with human papillomaviruses, they may infect cells in the basal layer of cutaneous skin. For human papillomaviruses, hair follicles may represent an important site of infection (Doorbar, 2005). Interestingly, MCPyV, HPyV6, HPyV7, and TSPyV have been found in hair follicles (reviewed in Moens et al., 2011). Mature papillomavirus particles are not released until the infected cells reach the upper skin layer (Doorbar, 2005). This may also be the case for these human PyV and therefore these viruses do not depend on the viroporin properties of agnoprotein.",

Shedding a limited number of infectious virus particles may prevent the destruction of the infected host cell and enable PyV to evade the immune system. This may allow the virus to establish a persistent infection. The agnoproteins of BKPyV, JCPyV and SV40 may function as uORFs that reduce VP1 production, while virally encoded miRNA downregulates LT-ag expression. Both mechanisms allow the virus to control the number of progeny virions produced in an infected cell. The new human polyomaviruses MCPyV, HPyV6 and HPyV7 all lack agnoprotein, but they seem to be continuously shed in high numbers (e.g., 2\u00d7106 MCPyV genome equivalents and 5\u00d7103 HPyV6 genome equivalents) from the skin of healthy individuals (Schowalter et al., 2010). However, intracellular retention of viral antigens occurs until the infected cells reach the uppermost epithelial layers. Virions released in this way may avoid encountering the immune system. Therefore these viruses do not need agnoprotein to control the amount and the way progeny virus particles are released.",

            "text": "The role of agnoprotein remains enigmatic in many ways, but abrogation of agnoprotein expression impairs viral propagation (Shenk et al., 1976; Myhre et al., 2010; Sariyer et al., 2011). Despite its small size, agnoprotein seems to be a multifunctional polypeptide implicated in viral transcription, replication, assembly and maturation and release. Agnoprotein accomplishes these tasks either by itself (viroporin), through interaction with other viral proteins (LT-ag) or by associating with cellular proteins. The functional implications of interactions with cellular partners are not completely understood. The expression and function of agnoprotein in PyV other than BKPyV, JCPyV and SV40 has not been addressed. Studies aimed to elaborate the role of these putative agnoproteins in the viral life cycle are necessary. Besides their crucial role in viral replication, BKPyV and JCPyV agnoproteins have been detected in tumors. Moreover, cell culture studies have shown that agnoprotein can affect cell cycle progression and DNA repair (Del Valle and Khalili, 2010; Khalili et al., 2005). Thus, agnoprotein may be an attractive target for viral therapy in malignant and non-malignant (e.g., nephropathy, PML) diseases. Antibodies raised against peptides encompassing the putative agnoprotein of non-HPyV may help to determine whether agnogene in these viral genomes is expressed. The low degree of similarity of these agnoproteins with BKPyV and JCPyV agnoprotein may indicate that they interact with non-related cellular proteins and fulfill other functions. Finally, the identification of novel PyV in other species and humans may reveal new members of the Polyomaviridae encoding agnoprotein and unveil the co-evolution with their hosts.",
