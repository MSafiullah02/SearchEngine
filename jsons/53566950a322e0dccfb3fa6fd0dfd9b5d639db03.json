Additionally, 22 of the included COVID-19 patients did not exhibit any symptoms and were only found to be positive via the results of the SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. Most patients had systemic, respiratory, and digestive symptoms. Fever, dry cough, and fatigue were the three most common symptoms. On admission, most patients had white blood cell and neutrophil counts in the normal range and lymphocyte counts below the normal range. About a quarter of COVID-19 patients had differing degrees of hepatic function abnormality and one in ten patients had kidney function abnormality. Most patients had increased CRP, decreased albumin, and increased LDH. The vast majority of patients also had bilateral pneumonia in CT imaging.",

The mortality rate in our study was lower than that indicated in a previous report but higher than that reported in another study (5, 11) . This heterogeneity is probably due to differences in the case inclusion criteria. However, our results were closer to the mortality rate indicated by official national statistics, which is 3.97%. Cumulative studies confirmed that older age was associated with poor outcomes in COVID-19 patients. In our study, older patients were prone to have severe COVID-19 symptoms, unimprovemrnt, and were more likely to die in hospitals. Based on previous findings in animal studies, older animals were shown to have stronger host innate immune responses to SARS-CoV infection (12) . The unsatisfactory control of viral replication and more prolonged proinflammatory responses in older individuals due to age-dependent defects was found to lead to a marked decline in cell-mediated immune function and reduced humoral immune function, which potentially leads to poor outcomes (13, 14) .",

In our study, approximately one in six COVID-19 patients had digestive symptoms, especially diarrhea, which is more than was reported in a previous study (11) . The digestive symptoms of most COVID-19 patients were mild, which seemed to be inconsistent with the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. A possible explanation is that SARS-CoV-2 in the sputum of COVID-19 patients is transmitted to the digestive tract through swallowing. There, under the action of various digestive enzymes, the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 in the digestive tract is weakened and the virus is degraded into fragments that only cause mild digestive symptoms but not serious gastrointestinal damage.",
