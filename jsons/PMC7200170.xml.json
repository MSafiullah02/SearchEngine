While this link may look obvious for multiple sclerosis, due to its auto-immune nature [5], it is less so for disorders due to the accumulation of neurotoxic aggregates, like Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Influenza epidemics are associated with neurological manifestations, and the H5N1 virus reportedly induces Parkinsonian pathology in mice, both findings possibly explained by the activation of inflammatory pathways [4]. However, the exact mechanisms of these effects and whether coronaviruses show a similar action remain unclear. The current Covid-19 pandemic provides an unprecedented opportunity to disentangle the link between viral/infectious diseases, inflammation, and the risk of brain disorders, as mentioned here below.",

Hyposmia is a common symptom of different neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders [6] and has been associated with levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), an inflammatory biomarker deeply investigated in brain disorders [7]. Of note, IL-6 action is blocked by tocilizumab, a drug currently used to inhibit cytokine storm in Covid-19 patients [8]. A recent study revealed c-reactive protein levels above the low-grade inflammation threshold (> 3 mg/l) for three out of four patients presenting with loss of taste and olfaction, which were reported to be more intense and long-lasting than those in common cold disease [2]. Therefore, accumulating evidence suggests systemic inflammation may be a potential pathway to explain neurological sequelae of Covid-19, a hypothesis which should be investigated more in depth.",
