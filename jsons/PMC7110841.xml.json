BCV can cause diarrhoea in calves and winter dysentery in adult cattle as well as respiratory disease of variable severity (Stair et al., 1972, Saif et al., 1986, Saif, 1990, Alenius et al., 1991). Infection with BRSV can lead to outbreaks of severe respiratory disease (Verhoeff et al., 1984, Elvander, 1996, Viuff et al., 1996).",

It is possible that factors such as latency/reactivation, low level circulation of virus within and/or between herds or reservoir hosts may play a role. Sequencing indicates that virus within herds during an outbreak is identical, but varies both temporally and spatially between outbreaks, suggesting that outbreaks are caused by \u2018new\u2019 virus rather than through latency or the existence of carrier animals (Larsen et al., 2000, Liu et al., 2006, Bidokhti et al., 2012).",

In order to control these infections better, it is important to clarify further some aspects of their epidemiology and to evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic procedures. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, very few longitudinal studies charting the epidemiology of BCV and BRSV infections in cattle herds have been performed. Van der Poel et al. (1993) investigated BRSV infection in six dairy herds over a 1-year period and found a rise in titres but not seroconversion in antibody-positive animals during the summer period. H\u00e4gglund et al. (2006) conducted a 1-year serological study of calves in a region of southern Sweden where both BCV and BRSV are endemic and found seroconversion to occur in animals mainly during the winter.",

Sampling a subset of young animals has previously been used in testing for bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVBV) (Houe, 1992). Bulk tank milk (BTM) is also convenient way of monitoring infection status in dairy herds, and the relationship between the BTM antibody titre and the serological status of young animals has previously been evaluated for BVDV (Houe, 1994). However, such an approach has not been used to investigate if there is an association between BTM antibody concentrations and the serological status of young animals to BCV or BRSV.",

However, it is likely that either the farmers and/or veterinarians involved in the sampling would have become aware of such new infections. Given how readily both BCV and BRSV transmit within a group of cattle, herds negative in primiparous pooled samples were likely to have been free from the active spread of infection for at least 2 years (corresponding to the age of the cows included).

We concluded that the measurement of antibodies to BCV and BRSV in BTM is an effective method of monitoring herds in areas where virus circulation has been very low or absent for a long time period. However, our findings also suggest that the use of primiparous pooled milk samples is more effective in identifying susceptible herds in the early phases of control programs in endemic areas and for the purposes of animal trading/movement.
