It may be a local phenomenon. As yet data is only available from this department. It will be shown that this side difference is reflected in the 5 year survival. The season of presentation. Evidence will be presented that: carcinomas removed in this district in the first half of the year are smaller than those found later; that their histology and oestrogen receptor content differ; and that these differences are accompanied by characteristic differences in nodal histology. The possibility that the latter are basic to the problem will be discussed. Lymph nodes metastases in the axilla are sometimes the initial clinical manifestation of an occult carcinoma of the breast. Usually such lesions are obviously carcinomatous, and their morphology is often suggestive of origin in the breast. It is well known that some metastatic infiltrative lobular carcinomas may mimic diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Less well documented are the lesions in this study, in which a nodular and sclerosing morphology, combined with a non-cohesive character of the carcinoma may superficially simulate nodular sclerosing lymphomas. A retrospective survey of breast carcinomas with axillary nodal metastases showed that 'nodular sclerosing' nodal tumours were restricted to cases of infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the breast. These distinctive metastatic tumours, although uncommon, merit attention in view of the inconspicuous nature of some infiltrative lobular carcinomas in the breast. Their prompt recognition in cases of isolated axillary lymph node enlargement may obviate unnecessary investigations in the search for other primary origins. Use of periodic acid-Schiff staining and antisera to epithelial membrane antigen can facilitate the diagnosis of these metastatic tumours. The presence and distribution of the pentraxin known as amyloid P component (AP) in the human adult breast was studied using a direct immunohistochemical technique. AP was invariably present. It was constantly associated with elastic fibres and with areas of elastosis. AP was not detected in any of the epithelial basement membranes. From these and other studies it is evident that AP is not particular to amyloid disease but is ordinarily a constituent of both normal and disease-affected connective tissues. The pentraxin known as amyloid P component (AP) is ordinarily present in human adult connective tissues. An identical, or closely similar, macromolecule is present in human adult serum but only very low levels are detectable in umbilical w r d blood. It was therefore decided to investigate the presence of AP in connective tissues of the very young. This was done using a direct immunofluorescent technique on frozen sections of skin from a series of obstetric. surgical and post mortem specimens. AP was not detected in foetal, neonatal or very young infant dermis. It was first detectable in the third year of life and approximated to the adult pattern by the fourth year, In this respect AP differs from other known connective tissue ligands, such as fibronectin and laminin, which first appear early in foetal development.",

Nonetheless, over 40 purportedly human breast tumour cell lines have been reported, and proved of some value in laboratory studies of human breast carcinoma. With few exceptions these cell lines are essentially monomorphic in tissue culture. In contrast, PMC42, a novel human breast tumour cell line established from a pleural effusion of a patient with metastatic breast cancer, exhibits an extremely pleomorphic growth pattern in monolayer culture. Eight morphological cell types have been observed, in both phase contrast and electron microscopic studies. The relationship between these cell types and those found in the normal and neoplastic human breast will be discussed with reference to the possibility of PMC42 representing a stem cell population.",

Human breast organoids obtained by enzymatic digestion of reduction mammoplasties and identical to those used to prepare cultures, have now been established in immunologically incompetent mice. Using antibodies to keratin, myosin, laminin and type IV collagen it has been possible to demonstrate the maintenance of the normal relationship between epithelial and myoepithelial cells with the production of basement membrane materials. The epithelium continues to proliferate beyond 3 mth and the distribution of monoclonal antibodies which react with luminal membrane antigens, e.g. M8 and M18, is as reported in the normal resting breast. This model is being studied in conjunction with in vitro techniques to define the responses of the buman tissue to both physiological and carcinogenic manipulations.",

            "text": "It has previously been shown that the monoclonal antibody, Cal, reacts with most malignant cells but few normal cells. The epitope to which it binds has been designated Ca. Using the Cal monoclonal, it will be shown that Ca is expressed in normal placenta, apocrine glands, sweats ducts, sebaceous glands, type I1 pneumocytes of lung, and epithelia of fallopian tube and urinary tract. It is also found in certain non-neoplastic conditions of breast and cervix. In the latter tissues the staining reaction was confined to the membrane of cells. By comparison in malignant preinvasive lesions of cervix, and possibly breast, Ca is cytoplasmic and membrane in distribution. Therefore, the qualitative expression of this antigen differs in malignancy and in non-neoplastic disorders. Furthermore it will also be shown that Cal reacts with all secondary cancers found in bone marrow so far examined. These malignant cells, whether isolated or in clusters, all express positive membrane and cytoplasmic staining. No cells in normal marrow, or in marrow disorders per se, react with Cal. This indicates that Cal screening of marrow is a much more effective way of picking up malignant cells than standard technology. The distinction between reactive and neoplastic mesothelium is often difficult to make using standard histological techniques. Since it has been suggested that the Cal antibody may be helpful in the diagnosis of malignancy, we have assessed its value in a series of needle biopsies of pleura where the pathological diagnosis has been confidently established. We studied a total of 24 cases; 11 of these were proven mesotheliomas, 8 contained purely reactive mesothelium and five were metastatic carcinomas. All the blocks examined were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded and each was stained by an indirect immunoperoxidase method using an antibody concentration of 0.5~~g/ml. 7 out of 11 mesotheliomas examined and 4 out of 8 reactive biopsies showed positive staining. Of the five metastatic carcinomas two adenocarcinomas (from colon and ovary) and one squamous cell carcinoma stained positively. However, another squamous cell carcinoma and a small cell anaplastic carcinoma failed to stain. There was no appreciable difference in the pattern of staining between reactive and neoplastic mesothelium. In both instances staining was focal; in all positive cases cell membrane staining was present and in several cases cytoplasmic staining was also seen. These results suggest that the Cal antibody is of little value in distinguishing malignant from reactive mesothelium.",

However, brain tumours fluoresce brightly, so it is supposed that administration of the tumour photosensitiser. haematoporphyrin derivative (HpD), followed by cranial illumination would specifically destroy brain tumours without damaging normal brain tissue. However, we have found that mice given HpD and illuminated through the intact skull with red light (630 nm) die within hours with cerebral oedema and necrosis of neurones. Cerebral photosensitivity persists for weeks after administration of HpD, so it cannot be due to persisting circulating porphyrins. Further, it is not due to damage to the choroid plexus or paraventricular regions as necrosis is sharply delimited to superficial areas of cerebrum or cerebellum in the illuminated area.",

Battersby Department of Pathology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9AG Among the various forms of sclerosing lesion in the breast the radial scar deserves interest because of the compositional similarities with tubular cancers. There is a radial arrangement of hyperplastic or cystic parenchyma around an elastotic distorted centre containing haphazardly scattered ductules. Study of biopsy and mastectomy material discloses a general incidence of about lo%, most commonly at age 40-60 yr and also occurring bilaterally. Found both singly and in large numbers scattered throughout the breast, they are usually less than 5 mm and only rarely as much as 10 mm. Although readily recognised from their elastotic centre, supravital staining and subgross stereomicroscopy greatly assist identification of early stages. Ultrastructural studies show myofibroblasts at the centre of the lesion in early phases of development which probably occurs at the point of duct branching. There is also an unusual disturbance in the organisation of the epithelial stromal junction, with focal disruption of the basal lamina and deposition of filamentous and fibrillary material including collagen and elastin. The consequences of impaired parenchymal stromal barriers may be significant when associated with persistent or renewed myofibroblast activity. distinguishing between malignant and nonmalignant lesions. We identified 20 paraffin blocks each from different cases described as normal breast, benign disease and malignant disease (N=60). Each was stained with the immunoperoxidase method using the Cal antibody at a concentration of 50pg/ml. The cytoplasm, free border, and luminal content components were systematically graded; both duct and acinar epithelium were scored separately. Review of these sections showed that the Cal antibody invariably stained at least one of these components in all 20 normal breasts examined. Similarly examination of 13 fibroadenomata showed some positively staining epithelial component in 12. In epitheliosis (N=9), co-existing with cancer, a wide range of staining was found from undetectable to maximum. Luminal border staining was a frequent feature of epitheliosis but some severe epitheliotic lesions did not stain at all. All cancers studied (N-20) were positive in a focal manner. Cytoplasmic staining was a strong feature of carcinomata but since normal tissue sometimes had positive cytoplasmic staining this feature was of limited diagnostic use. A striking feature of the breast sections was the luminal border staining of apocrine epithelium, regardless of whether this epithelium was metaplastic, included in a fibroadenoma, or within a normal gland of the overlying breast skin. Further tests on glands situated in the overlying dermis showed that a substantial portion of normal sweat glands stained positively; as did part of each sebaceous gland. Benign tumours of apocrine glands (syringocystadenomata papillifera and a tubular hydradenoma) were also found to stain along the luminal border. In conclusion the extent of staining of normal tissues compromises the assessment of borderline malignancy by the Cal antibody. entirely resolved. We have studied a series of 10 biopsies of mammary Paget's disease, together with sections of the tumours from the same patients' mastectomy specimens, using two commercially prepared monoclonal antibodies raised to human milk fat globulin membrane (HMFG-1 & 2). These antibodies stain normal and neoplastic mammary epithelium and do not stain normal epidermis. A third monoclonal antibody (L61), with specificity for cytokeratins, was also employed in this series. Formalin fixed paraffin wax embedded sections of routine biopsy material were stained using an antimouse Idperoxidase conjugate as the second antibody. In all cases the neoplastic breast epithelial cells showed variable surface and cytoplasmic staining, whilst the normal duct epithelial cells showed surface staining only with HMFG-1 & 2. Cytoplasmic staining of intra-epidermal Paget's cells was seen with both of these antibodies. Therefore Paget's cells present in the epidermis exhibit antigens characteristic of neoplastic breast epithelium. This is supportive evidence for a ductal origin of intra-epidermal Paget's cells.",

Jones Department of Pathology, Southampton University, General Hospital, Southampton SO9 4XY In pleural biopsies even when adequate material is obtained, there is frequently a problem in distinguishing malignancy from reactive pleurisy. This problem is magnified in the case of malignant mesothelioma which either may closely simulate mesothelial hyperplasia and fibrous pleurisy or otherwise may be indistinguishable from carcinoma. Human milk fat globule antigens (HMFG 1 and 2) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) can be demonstrated in a wide variety of carcinomas. The immunoperoxidase (PAP) technique was used in this study to demonstrate these antigens, using monoclonal antisera to HMFG 1 and 2 and polyclonal antiserum to CEA, in paraffin embedded formalin fixed tissue from 12 malignant mesotheliomas, 16 pulmonary carcinomas, 5 reactive pleuras and 3 reactive pleural fluid clots. 26 out of 28 of the tumours were positive with two or more of the antisera. Human milk fat globule staining did not discriminate between mesotheliomas, carcinomas of any type or blastomas. CEA did not stain any of the mesotheliomas. Sections from normal and reactive pleura did not stain with any of the antisera, although normal epithelial cells stained strongly for HMFG 1 and 2. Further work is being carried out on reactive mesothelium. The high proportion of tumours which express these markers, and the observation that reactive and normal mesothelial cells and fibrous pleurisy do not, make this profile of antisera of great potential value in distinguishing malignancy from reaction in the pleura. polyclonal antiserum to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). The spun deposit was washed three times and then cytocentrifuged. Blood stained fluids were first centrifuged over Ficoll. Specimens were selected by examination of a Diff Quick stained slide to exclude poorly cellular samples and transudates. 29 were negative for carcinoma on routine cytology. 18 of these were negative with all three antisera but 6 showed peripheral staining of reactive mesothelial cells with HMFG antisera. 5 showed diffuse or granular intracytoplasmic staining with one or more antisera; all 5 were from patients with proven carcinoma. 22 were positive for carcinoma on routine cytology. One of these was equivocal and was later shown to be due to mesothelial hyperplasia. 14 (64%) showed positive staining with one or more antisera. 8 were negative with all three antisera: these included the false positive case and two in which scanty malignant cells were identified only in sections of the clot. CEA was the most specific marker for carcinoma. It had the disadvantage of also staining polymorphs. HMFG 1 and 2 were less specific because they stained mesothelial cells particularly in patients with liver disease. This staining was qualitatively different from that seen in carcinoma cells but must be regarded as a disadvantage of this use of these antisera.",

However investigation of the precise mode of action of this cytoplasmic protein is restricted by the current inability to detect its presence in a steroid-free environment. To provide an alternative method of detection and assay, which avoids the use of radiolabelled glucocorticoids, a monoclonal antibody to the rat glucocorticoid receptor has been produced. The heat-activated glucocorticoid-receptor complex from rat liver has been isolated and partially purified by affinity chromatography on DNA-cellulose. BALB/c mice were immunised with repeated doses of the purified preparation the spleen cells isolated and fused with NS1 mouse myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol. The hybrid cells were cloned and those producing antibodies against the receptor identified by radioimmunoassay and subsequently injected into BALB/c mice to generate ascites tumours yielding substantial quantities of monoclonal antibodies. Each of these antibodies is being characterised to confirm its specific glucocorticoid receptor binding activity and to establish the antigenic site and the affinity to various physiological forms of the receptor. The antibodies will be used for histochemical and biochemical analysis of receptor distribution and function in cells and tumours of varying glucocorticoid sensitivity. ",

The patients are already prone to respiratory and other infections so it is important to determine whether the barbiturate interferes with lymphocyte function since this may indicate an immunosuppression that will put the patient at further risk. The effect of thiopentone (very short acting barbiturate), 5 intermediate acting drugs and phenobarbitone (long acting barbiturate) on the growth of lymphocytes was studied in PHA stimulated culture of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal subjects: there was no intersubject variation in response and the barbiturates generally ranked similarly in potency in the various tests. Barbiturates interfered with lymphocyte activation by reduction both in the percentage of cells responding to stimulation and in volume growth rate in a dose-dependent manner. The DNA synthesis rate of 72 h cultures was also reduced and flow cytometry showed interference with cellular RNA and DNA growth, Thiopentone and pentobarbitone were most potent in reduction of lymphocyte growth at concentrations comparable to the blood levels required for therapeutic effect. Other intermediate acting barbiturates appeared to be relatively non-toxic to lymphocytes in tissue cultures at comparable concentrations and these drugs may be safer agents for reduction of intracranial pressure. and developed immunohistochemically with a second antibody and a stain for peroxidase. In Mantoux reactions from 2 subjects with healed pulmonary tuberculosis the inflammatory infiltrate at 96 h was arranged predominantly as foci around dermal blood vessels and consisted mainly of T cells carrying the T3 marker. The correct OKT4:OKT8 ratio (c 3.40) in the focal infiltrate is higher than in the peripheral blood lymphocytes. There is also a diffusely scattered scanty infiltrate of lymphocytes between the dermal collagen fibres in the Mantoux reaction and these migrating cells mainly carry the T8 marker: the OKT4:OKT8 ratio for the whole section is substantially lower (1.31-2.00). During the development of a Mantoux reaction from 48 h through 72 h to 96 h the lymphoid infiltrate becomes progressively more dense but the distribution of the subpopulations remains stable. The same approach was used to study biopsies of patch tests from 11 patients with delayed hypersensitivity (DH) reaction and 9 with irritant reactions. There was no clear cut histological distinction between the biopsies in the two groups since the perivascular infiltrate occurred in all lesions and was mainly composed of lymphocytes. The focal infiltrate was somewhat more extensive in the DH patients who also showed much more extensive T8 cell migration beyond the perivaxular foci: PMN were more numerous in the irritant reactions. Six patients with reactions that did not fall clearly into either group on clinical criteria were studied: 3 had appearances similar to the DH patients and 3 bore a similarity to the irritant reactions.",

Previous studies have shown a prevelance of lymphocytic thyroiditis which varies with age, sex and ethnic origin and shows a variable relationship to the presence of thyroglobulin and microsomal autoantibodies. 163 thyroid glands were removed at post-mortem from unselected adult patients in two Southampton hospitals over a 6-mth period. The whole glands were weighed, sliced and examined histologically to determine the presence and severity of thyroiditis, the results being expressed morphometrically using a simple technique involving a microcomputer, a digitiser pad and a projecting microscope. The clinical notes were reviewed in each case. Autoantibody levels were retrieved from the notes if performed within a year of death. In a small proportion of cases antibody titres were established by analysing samples of blood taken at post-mortem. In women the mean thyroid mass was 18.7 g whilst in men it was 22.4 g. Varying degrees of thryoiditis were prc;ent in 56% of women and 24% of men. The significance of these findings and the autoantibody results will be discussed and related to previous reports of similar studies on other ethnic groups.",

Wyllie Department of Pathology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh Apoptotic cells are rapidly phagocytosed either by tissue macrophages or by adjacent epithelial cells. In this study the changes on the surface of an apoptotic cell leading to its recognition by macrophages were investigated. An in uitro assay was established that allowed quantification of the binding of Balb/c mouse thymocytes to Balbk mouse peritoneal macrophages. Thymocytes rendered apoptotic by exposure to methyl prednisolone in culture bound in significantly greater numbers than did non-apoptotic thymocytes. This binding could be fully inhibited by N-acetyl glucosamine but not by mannose, suggesting a role for a macrophage surface lectin. The binding was neither temperature nor serum dependent. There were definite differences between the characteristics of the binding of damaged erythrocytes and of apoptotic thymocytes to peritoneal macrophages. This indicates that the recognition of altered self cellsa prerequisite for their phagocytosismay be mediated by several different nonimmunological mechanisms. The signals whereby senescent erythrocytes are recognised by macrophages and removed from the circulation are poorly understood. However, both Fc and C3 receptors as well as the galactose binding lectin on the surface of the macrophage have been implicated. Human erythrocytes incubated in normal saline at 37\" for 24 h were used as a putative model for senescent erythrocytes and their binding in uitro to Balb/c mouse peritoneal macrophages was quantified. Little binding of fresh erythrocytes was observed, whilst saline injured erythrocytes were bound in large numbers. This binding was not mediated by macrophage Fc or C3 receptors. Free galactose in the medium did not inhibit binding but partial inhibition was obtained with L-fucose and to a lesser extent with N-acetyl glucosamine, arabinose and N-acetyl galactosamine. The binding was temperature and divalent cation dependent and inhibited by sodium azide. The results show that macrophage recognition of damaged cells does not require serum factors and if macrophage surface lectins are involved the specificity depends upon structures more complex than a single monosaccharide.",

The cells isolated from the skin express Ia and bear FC and C3 reactors and have membrane ATPase activity. They have dendritic rather than macrophage morphology.

Pigment was identifiable in neonatal animals and occurred in the absence of any other abnormality. Its appearance under the light microscope and its tinctorial and histochemical properties indicate that it can be classified with the lipofuscins. Ultrastructural studies have shown that the pigment is contained within lysosomes. Susceptibility to pigmentation showed dominant autosomal inheritance. Splenic lipofuscinosis was prevented either by a deficiency of melanin or by homozygosity for a non C57BL allele close to the c-p region of chromosome 7. The presence of a C57BL allele at a locus on another chromosome is necessary for lipofuscinosis to occur. The precise histogenesis, chemical composition and functional significance of the lipofuscins have not been firmly established and there is controversy about the relationship between lipofuscin and melanin. Murine splenic lipofuscinosis provides a source of readily accessible material and is a suitable model with which to investigate these problems. produced by osteoblasts, act physiologically as direct inhibitors of osteoclastic bone resorption: they induce an identical change in the behaviour of isolated osteoclasts (inhibition of motility) to that caused by calcitonin, an inhibitor of bone resorption; they act, like calcitonin, through cyclic AMP; they induce complete immotility in osteoclasts, and bone resorption is known to involve motile processes. We have also found that PGs exert a stimulatory effect on osteoclasts if osteoblasts are also present: when PGs were added to isolated osteoclasts, osteoclastic motility was inhibited for several hr, after which osteoclasts became refractory to further inhibition and gradually recovered previous levels of motility; if osteoblasts and osteoclasts were co-cultured the period of direct inhibition of osteoclasts by PGs was more transient, and was followed not merely by a gradual return to normal motility but by a sustained increase in motility beyond that seen in the control period before PGs were added. Osteoblasts thus have the capacity both to inhibit (through PGs) and stimulate (by an unknown mechanism) osteoclasts, and addition of PGs from an external source (such as inflammatory or tumour cells) may disturb the homeostatic control of osteoclasts by osteoblasts: recognition by osteoblasts of excessive levels of environmental PGs may cause a homeostatic increase in osteoclastic stimulation by osteoblasts, while the sustained high levels of PGs cause osteoclasts to become refractory to the inhibitors.",

We prepared slices of human cortical bone using a diamond-impregnated wheel, and settled osteoclasts onto these slices. We found that the osteoclasts formed characteristic pits and depressions in the bone surface during incubation. Bone resorption by these osteoclasts appeared to be intermittent, with alternating episodes of resorption and migration leaving 'footprints' of resorbed bone. Although both organic and mineral components of bone were resorbed, bone mineral was resorbed more deeply, leaving organic fibres lining the surface of the pit. Our observations are compatible with the view that the mineral component of bone is responsible for the initiation of enzyme release by osteoclasts: when mineral is resorbed beyond the organic component the osteoclast ceases resorption and recommences migration until fresh exposed mineral is contacted. This technique makes it possible, for the first time, to analyse the properties of the substrate which induce bone-resorptive behaviour in osteoclasts, and to assess the direct and indirect effects of hormones and cells on the induction, stimulation and inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption.",

By contrast, infectious virus entered and replicated within S-phase and asynchronous cells with equal efficiency.

Specimens of colon were immunostained with specific antibodies to natural PHI and VIP. Immunostaining was quenched by absorption of each antiserum with the corresponding peptide (10 nmol/ml) but not diminished by addition of VIP to the PHI antiserum or PHI to the VIP antibodies. PHIimmunoreactivity occurred exclusively in nerves, which were similar in appearance and distribution to those containing VIP-immunoreactivity, but were less numerous. The nerves were present in each layer of the colonic wall and PHI-immunoreactive ganglion cells were seen in the sub-mucous plexus. Examination of serial 3 Fm sections revealed four apparent cell populations. Those containing VIP formed approximately 50% of all ganglion cells. Roughly one-half of these also contained PHI. The third most numerous type were non-immunoreactive cells whilst a minor population displayed predominantly PHI immunoreactivity. Thus, variable concentrations of these peptides occur within neurons. It can be concluded that some ganglion cells of the human gut contain PHI and VIP, indicating their possible co-storage or common origin from a single precursor molecule.

Ngaione specifically causes injury to the periportal parenchymal cells under these conditions and the initial fibrogenic reaction takes place in this zone. This is followed by rapid development of regeneration nodules in the periportal zone which becomes separated from the apparentty normal centrilobular zone by a continuous midzonal band of connective tissue. With time and increase in the ngaione dose, the cells of the centrilobular zone remote from the central vein gradually undergo degeneration and necrosis at the midzonal margin, allowing the zone of fibrous tissue to increase in width. Finally, the centrilobular parenchyma is completely lost and entirely replaced by new connective tissue. The liver then consists of regeneration nodules which are resistant to the toxic ngaione, and connective tissue containing the hepatic vasculature and bile ducts and ductulesnamely, the complete picture of cirrhosis. Apart from the short time needed to produce the model, few, if any, animals become sick or die in the course of development of the lesion, and for a substantial part of the induction period the metobolically important centrilobular parenchymal zone remains undamaged. This is in contrast to what occurs with CCI, and other well-known hepatotoxic agents which specifically and extensively damage the centrilobular zone and which often results in low yields of cirrhotic animals.",

Neither nodules nor carcinomas were observed at this time in control rats given the nitrosamines or phenobarbitone alone. In previous work we added a dietary change to the system in order to induce cell division soon after nitrosamine administration. This step is unnecessary for maximum tumour production using 30 mg/kg DEN. However, using 15 mg/kg DMN we find that adding dietary change produces hyperplastic nodules and/or carcinoma in all animals, 415 having carcinomas, while in the absence of dietary change, although almost all animals have hyperplastic nodules, only 2/11 of these had carcinoma.

We have therefore chosen to study the cell surface proteins of several cultured lymphoid tumour lines for the presence of specific antigens or changes in the glycoprotein patterns compared to normal cells. The surface glycoproteins of 2 lymphoblastoid, 2 lymphoma, 2 leukaemia and 1 myeloma cell lines were radiolabelled with using the Iodogen method. After being hypotonically swollen the cells were homogenised to remove the cell membranes which were then purified using sucrose gradient centrifugation. The membranes were solubilised in SDS prior to electrophoresis on SDS-gradient polyacrylamide slab gels which after fixation and stairing were dried onto filter paper and used for autoradiography. The results obtained on the autoradiographs will be discussed. Since 1979 fresh tissue from all lymph node biopsies received in the University Department of Pathology in Leeds has been stored in liquid nitrogen. During this period 131 lymph nodes have been subjected to cryostat sectioning and staining with a variety of monoclonal antibodies. The antibodies used were directed against immunoglobulins, Tcell subsets, Ia antigens and endothelium. Antibody localisation was demonstrated by an indirect immunoperoxidase technique and all of these sections were assessed independently by 2 observers. Polyclonal staining of immunoglobulin light chains was observed in all patients with Hodgkin's disease and nodes exhibiting reactive hyperplasia. The presence of light chain restriction was used to define the B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas; in these cases the commonest phenotype was IgM, D heavy chains and either kappa or lambda light chains. None of the B-cell lymphomas exhibited both kappa and lambda staining. Some preliminary information will be given about the response to treatment in groups defined by their cell surface membrane phenotype.",

All previous studies have used paraffin embedded tissue sections giving considerable shrinkage (area loss 29%, linear loss 16%) and compression artefacts (area loss 11%, linear loss in direction of cut 7%). In our hands glycol methacrylate embedded sections provide shrinkage and compression free sections. Inability to apply constant pressure fixation to small surgical specimens has been overcome by the way in which data is handled. Selection of airways for morphometric measurements is considerably complicated by angle of cut and the effects of disease processes. This problem has been overcome by sampling from standard areas close to the pleura and by excluding the 30% most elliptical airways from all cases. Using the data on basement membrane circumference combined with the maximum to minimum diameter ratios it is possible to create a theoretical lumen area for each airway on the bais of constructing a smooth ellipse of equivalent circumference and maximum to minimum diameter ratio. The ratio of measured to theoretical lumen area may be indicative of airway tone in life. We have studied the peripheral airway epithelium of 16 smokers and 4 non-smokers in surgically resected specimens with 1 p. Toluidine blue stained araldite sections for light microscopy and by electron microscopy. Goblet cells were found in the bronchioles and terminal bronchioles of both smokers and non-smokers. A significant increase in goblet cell number was noted in the bronchioles of smokers (mean 6.7% of total epithelial cells) compared to non-smokers (mean 1.2% of total epithelial cells, PcO.01). In terminal and respiratory bronchioles the goblet cells were again more fequent in smokers but this failed to reach statistical significance. Clara cells were present in all patients in bronchioles, terminal bronchioles and respiratory bronchioles. In bronchioles. the Clara cells were significantly more frequent in non-smokers (mean 8.3% of total epithelial cells) than in smokers (mean 4.3% of total epithelial cells, P<O.Ol). Similarly there were significantly more Clara cells in terminal and respiratory bronchioles of non-smokers.

Tissue was embedded in glycol methacrylate and cut at 2 F for autoradiography and additional tissue embedded in araldite after osmification and cut at 1 p and used to aid in the identification of the cell population. Fragments of lung tissue ranging in size from 1 mm3 to 150 mm3 were found to have good penetration of label throughout the fragments and did not show the 'rim' effect which we have previously seen with fragments of tumour under comparable conditions. Of the cells with labelled nuclei the largest proportion (48%) were found in the interstitial compartment of the lung, comprising: fibroblasts, smooth muscle monocytes, pericytes and mast cells. As expected, of the two types of alveolar epithelium; the type I1 pneumocytes accounted for the great majority of the labelled cells. Similar proportions of endothelial cells in alveolar walls were labelled and a small number of inflammatory and airway epithelial cells (less than 8%). 10% of the labelled cells could not be clearly indentified. There were no differences in the proportions of labelled cells between smokers and non-smokers. NSE has been found in neurons and neuronendocrine cells throughout the body. In neurons of the central nervous system, NSE-immunostaining has been correlated with maturation, appearing late in development. We therefore investigated the developmental pattern of NSE in the human respiratory tract and compared it to nerves and cells containing classical neurotransmitters or peptides. Trachea, bronchus and lung were obtained from fresh human abortuses, 7-16 (n=19) and 17-24 wk gestation (n=11), from neonates (n=9), infants (n=6) and adults (n= 15). NSE-immunostaining was present in neuroblasts and nerve fibres in the earliest foetus examined (8wk). It remained as the neuroblasts matured into ganglion cells and the nerve fibres extended to end organs. Acetylcholinesterase staining was weak in neuroblasts, becoming stronger as they matured into ganglion cells. Dopamine-P-hydroxylase-positive nerve fibres appeared at 18-20 wk, while VIP-immunoreactive nerve fibres were seen only late in development and particularly after birth. NSE-immunoreactivity was present in well developed neuroendocrine cells in the airway epithelium at 8 wk gestation and increased in number up to birth, gradually declining in adult lung. Bombesin-immunoreactivity was detected in these cells later than NSE-immunoreactivity. NSE-immunoreactivity is thus present from early gestation, appearing before classical neurotransmitters or peptides, and should prove useful in investigating the developmental pattern of the lung neuroendocrine system in health and disease.

Trachea, bronchus and lung were obtained from adult cats ( n = l l ) , rats (n=8), guinea-pigs (n=6) and human adults (n=15). Antibodies to natural porcine PHI and NPY were raised in rabbits. Preabsorption of each antiserum with its corresponding peptide abolished the immunostaining whereas addition of related peptides did not. PHI-immunoreactive ganglion cells and nerve fibres were present throughout the respiratory tract of all species, in the adventitia, around seromucous glands, in smooth muscle and blood vessels. NPYimmunoreactivity was localised to nerve fibres in the adventitia of blood vessels and airway smooth muscle. Radioimmunoassay showed significant concentrations of PHI and NPY in the mammalian respiratory tract. For example, PHI levels were high in the trachea and bronchus (32 k 9 pmol/g and 34 k 9 pmol/g in cat) with lower concentrations in the lung (19 k 2 pmol/g in cat).

We have attempted to use NSE immunostaining to detect SCCL cells in cytological smears and cell buttons prepared from serous fluids, sputum, endoscopic biopsies and electron microscopy. Five fixatives (formol saline, Bouin's fluid, glutaraldehyde, methanol, acetone) were employed on smears, two (formol saline, methanol) on cell buttons which were then wax-embedded. Antibody to rat brain NSE was raised in rabbits and characterised by absorption with antigen. Best results for NSE-immunostaining were obtained with smears fixed whilst still wet in methanol or formol saline for 20 min. Sections from cell buttons and endoscopic biopsies all had much weaker NSE-imrnunoreactivity than corresponding smears. Cells from all other lung tumour types examined were negative.

In contrast, expression of these antigens was much higher in metastases occurring 2 yr and longer (up to 14 yr) after treatment of the primary melanoma. These findings suggest that loss of HLA-A, B, C and Pzm expression on melanoma cells may be associated with progression of malignancy. HLA-DR-antigens were not detectable on nevi, but were locally and in some cases more diffusely present in half of the cases of primary cutaneous melanoma and all cases of metastatic melanoma. The staining pattern of various monoclonal antibodies against HLA-A, B, C and of those against HLA-DR antigens respectively were superimposable. Therefore, the differences in expression of histocompatibility antigens between nevocellular nevus and primary cutaneous melanoma and between primary and metastatic melanoma appear to be related to other factors than the specificity of the antibodies used by various investigators.",

The survivors have fewer (C3) lymph nodes involved by tumor and thinner primary tumors. However, some of these patients die of their disease even though hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained slides show melanoma in relatively few lymph nodes. We considered that light microscopy might underestimate the number of nodes involved by tumor. Sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph node tissues were stained with anti-S-100 protein antiserum in an immunoperoxidase assay with amino-ethylcarbazole as indicator. 650 nodes from 30 lymphadenectomy specimens were examined; 82 contained melanoma on HE staining (12.5%) and 308 were tumor positive when stained for S-100 protein (47%). An increased number of tumor-containing nodes was identified in 16/30 patients -9 were advanced from the good to the bad prognosis group and 6 of those died of melanoma. In the remaining 7, detection of more positive nodes did not alter prognosis category. Both techniques predicted favorable outcome with comparable accuracy (HE 11/13, 85%; S -100 protein 8/13, 61 %) but an unfavorable outcome was predicted more accurately using the S-100 protein approach (HE 6/17, 35%, S-100 protein 12/17, 71%) (p<0.05). Thus underidentification of tumor-containing lymph nodes is one source of error in the assessment of prognosis for patients with Stage I1 melanoma.",

When D3 was used to stain synchronous cultures of a chimp liver cell line the intensity and pattern of staining varied through the cell cycle. Immunoblotting of intermediate filament preparations from various sources indicated that the D3 determinant is present on several related polypeptides rather than a single polypeptide as described for our other antiintermediate filament antibodies. Preliminary studies indicate that immunoblotting of nuclear matrix proteins and cytoplasmic filament preparations from the same cell-line with D3 show a reaction with different polypeptides. This is the first time an antiintermediate filament antibody has been reported to react with the nucleus as well as cytoplasmic filaments and may help to elucidate the function of intermediate filaments particularly in diseases such as alcoholic liver disease where there is marked disruption of the cytoplasmic intermediate filament system.",

The justification for the use of this technique is tenuous since it has never been the subject of a properly controlled trial. Furthermore the survival rate after intracardiac injection is small. On theoretical and experimental grounds the optimal site of injection is the cavity of the left ventricle, other sites being ineffective or even counterproductive. In a series of 16 randomly selected postmortem referals in whom there had been a total of 34 attempted intracardiac injections, it was apparent that in only 16.5% of attempts was the left ventricle successfully entered. The majority of the injections entered the right ventricle or the left lung. Other structures damaged by the needle included the left anterior descending artery, the pulmonary artery and the aorta. In a further series of 16 cases, 32 intracardiac injections were attempted at postmortem and the needle tracts delineated with dyes. The left ventricle was successfully entered in 60% of attempts. This study would suggest that successful puncture of the left ventricle is infrequent during resuscitation and that there is room for improvement in technique.

Fine needle aspiration cytology is a simple and cheap technique which is being used with increasing regularity in Great Britain to provide a rapid and reliable pre-operative tissue diagnosis of breast masses. The value of the cytologist's report depends partly upon his skill as a microscopist but largely upon the quality of the smears submitted for examination. In an ideal world the aspirate would be taken and the smears would be prepared by pathology staff. In reality this is not always possible and so our clinical colleagues must perform the technique in many cases. We have produced a short video demonstration to instruct clinical staff who are going to use the method and to help avoid unnecessary negative smears resulting from poor technique. Certain tetracycline analogues such as doxycycline interfere with the growth of mitogen stimulated lymphocytes at concentrations comparable to therapeutic blood levels, whereas others like tetracycline have no obvious effect even at suprapharmacological concentrations. Doxycycline does not affect the initial recruitment of cells during lymphocyte activation, but has a progressively increasing influence on DNA synthesis during replicating growth. The metabolic basis of this effect is not yet understood. but it is different from that of the bacteriostatic action. The cytological appearance of 3-day PHA stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal donors was studied in cultures exposed to doxycycline and tetracycline (1-15 Fgiml, therapeutic range of blood levels 3-5 kg/ml) from the onset or for the last 6 h before harvesting: comparable, but less severe changes were found in the latter group. In cytocentrifuge smears stained with the Wright method, the main abnormality noted in cells cultured with 3-7 k g doxycycline/ml was the frequent occurrence of clusters of small vacuoles in the cytoplasm of stimulated cells, but at 15 kg/ml the number of 'blast' cells was reduced although some healthy mitotic cells were still seen: tetracycline produced much less severe damage than doxycycline at the same concentration. In TEM, cells cultured with doxycycline showed numerous cytoplasmic fat droplets, increased prominence of Golgi apparatus, abundant lysosomes and obvious membrane whorls and residual bodies: tetracycline had much less severe effects. Experiments to study the cause of the increased membrane turnover will be described.",

Anecdotal reports and previous publications had suggested that gastric cancer in North Wales, the area in the U.K. with the highest incidence, was of the diffuse/genetic type. We, therefore, decided to compare the relative proportion of the two histological types in North Wales, and the lowest incidence area, Norfolk. We found that the rates of intestinal to diffuse cases (ratio 1/D) in North Wales (380 cases) was 2.30 and in Norfolk (153 cases) was 1.89 (P>O.l). This is similar to the ratios reported elsewhere in Europe. In North Wales most of the diffuse type gastric cancer was found in the urban and coastal districts; in the rural areas nearly all the cancer was of the intestinal type (I/D 4.8). This difference was not reflected in Norfolk where the two types were more evenly distributed. These results suggest that the high incidence of gastric cancer in North Wales is not genetically determined and indicate that in that area there are causal environmental factors.

On thin sections and in immunoblotting experiments our monoclonal antibodies showed different specificities. In normal tissues clone 80 stained all types of epithelia except myoepithelium and podocytes of glomeruli. Clone 78 stained mainly squamous epithelium. Clone 77 stained differentiated squamous epithelium transitional epithelium, ductal epithelium and parenchymatous epithelium. These results confirm the heterogeneity of cytokeratins. In neoplasms clone 77 was positive with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Clone 78 stained squamous cell carcinoma and well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Clone 80 stained all epithelial tumours, including anaplastic carcinoma and is therefore useful in tumour diagnosis. To date, a detailed study of the distribution of different peptides in the guinea pig spinal cord has not been made, We therefore carried out a comprehensive mapping study of substance P, M-ENK, NPY and VIP in (cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral) levels of the spinal cord. Five guinea pigs were perfused intracardially with p-benzoquinone '0.4% w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline. After laminectomy, cryostat sections (15 pm) taken from the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral regions were immunostained using the PAP technique with antisera to substance P (1/8OOO), M-ENK (1/1OOO), NPY (1/1600) and VIP (1/8OOO). Substance P-immunoreactive fibres were strongly immunostained and particularly abundant in laminae I and 11. Fibres were seen in moderate amounts in the dorsolateral funiculus, laminae V and X . The distribution of M-ENK roughly parallelled that of substance P; fewer M-ENK-containing nerve fibres were seen. NPY was mainly distributed in the dorsolateral funiculus and laminae V; Some nerve fibres were also seen in laminae I and 11. VIP-containing fibres were found in laminae I and 11, where they were more abundant than in other areas. VIPimmunoreactive cell bodies were occasionally seen in lamina X. In all levels of the spinal cord the distribution of the peptides investigated showed a similar pattern. These results will expand our knowledge of peptidergic pathways in the guinea pig spinal cord and provide a basis for the study of changes in these peptides in experimentally induced pathological conditions. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a newly discovered peptide which is widely distributed in neuronal cell bodies and terminals of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Its distribution is similar to that of adrenergic nerves and, in some cases, the peptide and amine have shown co-localisation in the same cell. We report here on the immunocytochemical localisation of NPY-immunoreactivity to fibres in the uvea of guinea pig and rat, and on its relationship to sympathetic nerves. Whole mount preparations of iris and choroid were immunostained using an NPY antiserum, while adrenergic nerves were immunocytochemically identified with antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). In the iris of both animals, NPY-immunoreactivity was localised to a dense plexus of fibres in dilator and constrictor pupillae muscles, and surrounding the irridial blood vessels. NPY-immunoreactive nerves were also seen throughout the choroid of both species, mainly along and around the numerous blood vessels. In both iris and choroid the number and distribution of NPY-immunoreactive fibres was very similar to that observed for TH-immunoreactive nerves. These results confirm the presence in the eye of NPY-immunoreactive nerves, whose morphological similarity to TH-immunoreactive nerves is consistent with the neurophysiological findings, which suggest a modulatory action of NPY on adrenergic neurons.

In order to correlate the presence of substance P-containing nerves with the onset of neurogenic response we investigated the distribution of substance P in the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, sciatic nerves and skin of the hind leg in young rats from day 1 of birth to day 15 (n=10).

In the lumbar spinal cord substance P fibres were present from day 1 and increased in number in dorsal and ventral spinal cord with time. Substance P-containing cell bodies were visible in the dorsal root ganglia from day 1 but were most obvious at day 2, when a large number of the small cells were substance P positive. At day 15 fewer substance P-containing cell bodies were seen. In the sciatic nerve and the dorsal roots positive fibres were present at all stages. Similarly in the skin (innervated by the sciatic nerve) numerous substance P-immunoreactive fibres were visible from birth onwards.

In all species the localisation of VIP-containing fibres was similar. In cervical and thoracic regions, few VIP-immunoreactive nerves were present in the dorsal horn, intermediolateral cell columns and around the central canal. In lumbosacral segments a greater density of VIP-immunoreactive fibres were apparent in the dorsal horn.

The C-terminal flanking peptide (P) consists of 21 amino acids, with aspartic acid (D) at the N-terminal and asparagine (N) at the C-terminal and was thus named PDN 21. PDN occurs in the normal human thyroid and in medullary carcinoma of thyroid. It is reported to display a calcium-lowering activity similar in potency to that of calcitonin (hence its new name, katacalcin). As calcitonin has been found in neuroendocrine cells in human lung, we have investigated whether katacalcin also occurs in these cells. Lung tissue was obtained from human abortuses, 7-16 (n=19) and 17-24 wk gestation (n=11), from neonates (N=9), infants (n=6) and adults (n=15). Antibodies to synthetic katacalcin were raised in rabbits and controls included prior absorption of the antiserum with katacalcin which abolished immunostaining. Addition of calcitonin or other known pulmonary peptides did not diminish immunostaining. Serial paraffin sections were immunostained for katacalcin and calcitonin respectively, using the PAP technique. Numerous katalcin-immunoreactive cells were found in the airway epithelium of human neonatal lung, with fewer cells in foetal or adult lung. All katacalcin-containing cells were also immunoreactive for calcitonin. We have therefore demonstrated that the C-terminal flanking peptide of the human calcitonin precursor is present in the human lung and is co-localised with calcitonin in the same mucosal endocrine cells.",

The sub-gross analysis revealed that in most age categories there was an uneven distribution of total epithelium within the breast with lower exceeding upper quadrants.

The technique has been described as 'living pathology'. Unfortunately the planes of section used in life bear no relation to the standard pathological dissection. Since the planes of echo-cardiography are governed by access between ribs or above the sternum, pathologists who wish to collaborate with the clinician must perforce adopt new techniques. If the heart is fixed before dissection by pressure perfusion via the aorta a specimen is obtained in which the aortic and mitral valves are in the closed position. Not only can correlation with echocardiograms be made but the pathology of aortic root dilation and mitral valve prolapse is strikingly demonstrated. Transection of the specimen in the long axis through the anterior cusp of the mitral valve gives a plane identical both to M mode and 2D echocardiograms. The left ventricular outflow and apical or posterior aneurysms are demonstrated in a manner identical to that seen in life. Transection of the ventricles in the short axis allows measurement of cavity size and wall thickness. The measurements correlate well with those taken in life.

In order to solve these problems, computer programmes were developed in collaboration with a local company (Strathand Limited). These were designed to permit automatic encoding of data during report generation and the storage and retrieval of such data on the basis of name, accession number, SNOMED ' T and 'M' codes, special related ultrastructural codes and predetermined flags of interest. Such a system has been designed to run on an ACT Sirius I microcomputer and appears to represent a useful model for a records system in general histopathology. Although developed initially for the relatively small case load of the E.M. unit (up to 1, OOO cases per year) it could be adapted to meet the demands of a routine histopathology department with a case load of up to perhaps 15,000 cases per year. The capital cost of such an extended system is likely to be of the order of f30,000440,000.A retrospective study of post-mortem material in Accra has shown that 11% of nontraumatic deaths in subjects over 20yr was due to stroke, (9.8% of which were haemorrhagic), while hypertensive heart failure and mycardial infarction accounted for 7.5% and 0.5% respectively. To explain the high occurence of haemorrhagic strokes in Accra, a study was carried out of the cerebral vasculature using a modification of the post-mortem arteriographic technique of Ross-Russel (1963) and Cole and Yates (1967) . 310 cases were studied. Of 284 injected cases, 159 were hypertensives (56%) and 125 controls (44%). 30.8% of the hypertensives showed microaneurysms, compared to 11.2% of controls. All 310 cases were studied for other vascular abnormalitites including haemorrhages and macroaneurysms. There were 37.6% haemorrhages among the 181 hypertensives compared to only 1.6% of 129 controls. The Circle of Willis and its branches showed macroaneurysms in 16.6% of hypertensives compared to 8.5% of controls. The significance of these findings together with other relevant findings will be discussed in relation to work already carried out elsewhere. ",

In an attempt to localise renin in the vascular walls, we injected partially purified mouse renin (1 Goldblatt Unit) into rats that had undergone nephrectomy 17 hr earlier. Cryostat sections, 6 p n thick, postfixed in cold acetone, were stained by the indirect immunofluorescence method with monoclonal antibodies to mouse renin (diluted 1 :600). Positive immunoreactivity was observed among the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of the descending aorta, meningeal, uterine and penicillinate arteries. However, the walls of pulmonary arteries and inferior vena cava were devoid of any renin-like immunoreactivity. It is suggested that circulating renin can gain access to the media of systemic arteries, at which site it might influence blood pressure in certain situations.The number and intensity of immunostaining of these was more apparent later. The appearance of substance P in the periphery at these early stages, when the neurogenic inflammatory response cannot be evoked, suggests that either these substance P-containing nerves are not yet fully functional or that some other factors are necessary for neurogenic oedema. while the extent of peptidergic innervation has only been assessed by subjective evaluation. We describe here a new approach, which allows quantification of both endocrine and nerve elements in the intestinal mucosa. Mucosal samples were dissected from the intestinal wall, weighed and fixed in p-benzoquinone. The number of villi (or crypts) was counted in each and cryostat sections were cut oblique to the luminal surface. The line density (length per unit volume) of immunostained nerve fibres was assessed by counting the number of cross-sectioned fibres per unit area. From sample weight, villuskrypt number and line density, the nerve supply (length of fibres per villuskrypt unit) was calculated. From paired samples, thin mucosal strips were immunostained whole and microdissected into single villi and/or crypts for direct counting of endocrine cells. In 6 samples of human colon the mean number of enteroglucagon cells ranged between 6 and 15 per crypt, the length of VIP-containing nerve fibres between 17 and 50mm per crypt. In conclusion, this newly developed approach allows the integrated evaluation of endocrine cell populations and peptidergic nerve supply.",

We describe here the occurrence and distribution in this organ of nerves reactive to antisera against VIP and two other newly discovered peptides, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and PHI, by means of immunocytochemistry. The tissues were obtained from patients (n=9) aged 40-80yr old undergoing hysterectomy. VIP, NPY and PHI were immunostained in nerves which were mainly associated with blood vessels, smooth muscle and located in the submucosa of the vagina and the cervix, where they surrounded glands. Nerves containing VIP and NPY were the most abundant and showed some differences in distribution. VIP-immunoreactive nerve fibres were fine and widely distributed, while some NPY-immunoreactive nerves formed bundles and were more concentrated around blood vessels throughout the tissue. PHI-immunoreactive nerves had a similar distribution to VIP nerves but were less numerous. Ganglia, reactive either to VIP or to NPY antisera. were seen at the junction between the vagina and the uterus. These peptideimmunoreactive nerves were more dense in the tissues from younger patients than from the post-menopausal ones. The significance of these nerves in the female genitalia needs to be elucidated. ",

Immunocytochemical studies have shown the peptide to have a widespread yet discrete distribution and have revealed NPY-immunoreactive fibres in long projecting pathways in the brain. The stria terminalis is the major efferent pathway from the aitiygdaloid complex and possesses NPY-immunoreactive fibres in both its dorsal and ventral portions. We have examined the possible terminal projection of these fibres by experimental lesions of the stria terminalis pathway. Observations were made on cryostat sections of rat brain fixed by perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunostained for NPY by the peroxidase anti-peroxidase technique. Stereotactic knife lesions were performed under Sagatal anaesthesia to transect the stria terminalis unilaterally at co-ordinates 4.0-5.0 mm anterior, 2.5 mm lateral and 5.00 mm depth with respect to the intraaural line. The contralateral stria served as an internal animal control. Rats were allowed to survive post-operatively for 10 days. A loss of NPYimmunoreactive fibres after lesioning was observed most predominantly in the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis and anterior commissure. Fewer fibres wealso apparent in the preoptic regions of the hypothalamus. The majority of NPY fibres in the stria terminalis, therefore, form a diffuse amygdalofugal projection to the forebrain, terminating most abundantly in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and preoptic hypothalamus. NPY may play a role, therefore, in amygdaloid control of hypothalamic function. ",

Histology was available for 133 and 14 (10.5%) were judged to have benign disease. The 119 carcinomas were assessed for histological type and other features namely elastosis, fibrosis, necrosis, vascular or lymphatic invasion and nuclear grade. A similar classification was carried out on 1050 consecutive primary breast carcinomas treated from 1960 to 1970, and the same histological features eveluated for 200 who survived for less than 10 yr. There was a predominance of special histological types in the survivor group (54%) in contrast to the 200 dying within 10 yr (10.5) and to the major consecutive group of 1050 (24%). Taking other factors influencing survival into account by multivariate analsis the most significant histological feature identifying long term survival was special histological type. In addition to non-invasive cancer, the special invasive histological pure (or classical) types more common in the survivors were those of tubular, cribriform, medullary and lobular types.",

M.Forrest Departments of Pathology and Clinical Surgery, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9AG Screening for breast cancer among women aged 45-64yr has been carried out in Edinburgh since 1979 as part of a randomised trial. 147 cancers have been diagnosed in 'invited' well women and 100 of the mastectomies have been studied to assess the frequency of multifocal cancer. The method employed serial 'bread loaf' slices and their radiographs for multiple paraffin block selection to give a reconstruction map for the distribution of other foci of cancer. Multifocal cancer was detected in 33 cases (33%) the incidence being similar among the non-invasive and the invasive cancers. It was possible to identify the other foci as other primaries in all but two instances. In non-invasive cancer other foci were more likely to be confined to the reference tumour quadrant (RTQ) whilst the invasive cancers showed other quadrant turnour (OQT) more frequently. One case with an occult invasive focus occurred in the non-invasive cancers. Of 5 microinvasive cancers, the 2 with OQT had a reference lesion diameter greater than 25 mm. The nipple region was involved in 11 cases; in 4 of these it was the region of primary involvement, but in 5 of the others there was multifocal cancer involving OQT. Histological type of invasive cancer was not a reliable index on multifocal disease on its own, nor was lymph node status. These results have implications for selection into trials of conservation therapy and suggest that cases of non-invasive carcinoma or of invasive carcinomas less than 20mm that are lymph node negative will do best. Such cases comprise 55% of cancers occurring in a screening programme. N-7ooO Trondheim, Norway Depositions or particles consisting of inorganic material are commonly encountered in tissue sections, especially lung biopsies, but also in liver, skin and other sites. The identification of this material may be of great importance for diagnosis. Traditional methods include the use of more or less specific staining procedures as well as examination in polarized light. The important potential of energy dispersive X-ray microanalyis (EDX) has not been much exploited. This is probably in part due to the cumbersome and time-consuming processing currently in use for electron microscopy. However, paraffin sections may be directly examined in the electron microscope using t.he STEM mode giving an image which is very similar to the light microscopic appearance of the same section. A 3 km section is cut from a paraffin block and floated on water in the conventional way. The previously marked area of interest is carefully located on a Formvar/poly-1-lysine coated 'grid retainer'. The latter consists of a grid glued onto a perforated graphite plate which fits directly into the specimen holder of the electron microscope, Following deparaffinization and appropriate staining the section is mounted in water or glycerine and examined in the light microscope. Particles to be analyzed are sought and their precise localization recorded by drawing or photography. After dehydration and drying the same section is examined in the electron microscope and X-ray spectra obtained. This method has recently been established in our laboratory, and the results obtained so far seem very promising.",
