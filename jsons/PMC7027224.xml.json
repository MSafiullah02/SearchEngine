Up to recent generation antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), they are all based on the concept of monoamine deficiency in depression, and therefore increase levels of serotonin, norepinephrine and/or dopamine through different mechanisms. However, their limited efficacy has been under intense debate [3], and patients continue to experience low remission rates, delayed therapeutic onset, limited effectiveness in milder depression, intolerability and relapses [4]. The potential antidepressant effects of amantadine, an old enigmatic drug, have been addressed suggesting a versatile pharmacodynamics profile, but whether it acts through low-affinity non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonisms targeting glutamate, or other/combined modes, remained to be determined [5]. A completely novel capacity of amantadine as antiviral compound against human Borna disease virus (BDV-1) strains coincided with antidepressant effects in a BDV-infected patient with therapy-resistant bipolar depression [6]. This serendipitous discovery and further supportive open trials [7, 8] led us to conduct a \u201cproof of concept\u201d randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over trial reported here. The novel rationale included a paradigm shift which cross-linked both depression with BDV-1 infection, and anti-BDV capacity of amantadine with antidepressant efficacy in infected patients.",

Only BDV-1, the evolutionarily youngest prototype of the species Mammalian 1 bornavirus [10], has made it around the globe. BDV-1 strains (classical BDV-1 in humans and mammalian animals) have highly conserved RNA genomes (< 5% divergence) [11, 12], differing largely from a variegated squirrel 1 bornavirus (VSBV-1) which was proposed to underlie three human cases of fatal viral encephalitis in highly exposed squirrel breeders [13]. Classical BDV-1 strains are non-cytolytic, have target cells in brain and blood establishing life-long persistence, and share the ability to cause neurologic and behavioural disorders in mammalian hosts [14]. Although the majority of infections follows a sub-clinical course [15], even deadly outcomes are possible triggered by impaired immune defence [16, 17]. Unexpectedly, BDV-1 caused fatal encephalitis recently occurred in transplant recipients who had received organs from a BDV-1 infected healthy donor [18], and another case was reported unrelated to transplantation [19].",

Their acknowledgement was, however, constrained by misconception [25]. Serum antibodies (AB) and BDV-specific RNA in PBMCs worldwide indicated higher infection prevalence of psychiatric patients than controls in many but not all studies [26\u201338]. Failure of detection of any these markers in psychiatric patients occurred as well [39]. A recent meta-analysis indicated a 3.25 times higher likelihood of BDV infection for depressed than healthy people [40].

Inclusion criteria were BDV-1 infection and a current depressive episode. Infection variables were determined at the Robert Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany for at least two consecutive time-points prior to study entry (see Additional file 2: Study history and disclaimer). Of 36 patients allocated to intervention, 18 each were randomly assigned to either Group A (amantadine) or Group P (placebo) in period I (weeks 1\u20137; 6 weeks treatment, 1 week wash-out) of the trial. Amantadine sulphate (totally 200 mg) was given orally and twice daily (100 mg/morning and 100 mg/midday). Two patients of Group A and one patient of Group P discontinued intervention in period I. For the cross-over period II (weeks 8\u201314), 16 remaining patients of Group A received placebo and 17 remaining patients of Group P received amantadine (totally 33 patients).

ES values of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 were proposed to represent small, medium, and large effects, respectively [3, 49]. Amantadine efficacy in our trial even tripled overall ES values of 0.32 and 0.31, respectively, found for antidepressants including SSRIs in independent meta-analyses [55, 56]. According to a more recent analysis comparing three widely prescribed SSRIs which revealed a better ES magnitude (0.5) after excluding suboptimal doses [57], our trial came up with at least double ES values. Antidepressants were compromised by selective reporting of positive results [56]. Of seventy-four RCTs on twelve antidepressants involving more than 12,000 patients, studies judged positive by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (51%) were 12 times as likely to be published as were studies with non-positive results according to FDA (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the overall mean ES values were significantly different between published and unpublished studies reviewed by the FDA (0.37 and 0.15, respectively) [56]. Beyond this criticism, each drug was shown by meta-analysis to be superior to placebo although less than indicated by the literature. Their clinical significance, however, of overall 0.3 is still on debate, based on whether a sharp cut off of 0.5 proposed as medium ES value were used [55] instead of a more continuous measure for drug efficacy [3]. Whatever effect sizes of antidepressants were deemed beneficial in RCTs that of amantadine appeared to outreach them all. Like for total HAMD-21, amantadine was significantly superior to placebo across all measured single items of HAMD, with a large mean ES of 0.834 (week 7) for depressed mood, feeling of guilt, suicidal behaviour, work and activities, psychic anxiety, sexual function, and day-variations.",

A large study using the UK General Practice Research Database of the years 1993\u20131999 revealed that the risk of suicidal behaviour was increased in the first 4 weeks of antidepressants, particularly during the first 1 to 9 days [52]. A similar time-frame was found by a Swedish register-based nationwide case-crossover study, reporting a peak in suicide risk during the second and third week after initiation of SSRI therapy [53]. It is therefore of particular interest that in contrast in our study, amantadine significantly reduced suicidal behaviour as early as by 2 weeks of treatment (p = 0.039, ES = 0.662), earlier than the total HAMD score, thereby getting beyond the above safety gap of SSRIs.",

Ketamine, a non-competitive high-affinity NMDA antagonist of glutamate and licensed anaesthetic agent, has emerged as a promising candidate, since a single sub-anaesthetic intravenous dose (0.5 mg/kg) has elicited rapid improvement in depressed patients after 24 h, lasting 1\u20132 weeks. However, a broader application needs to address ketamine\u2019s critical obstacles that is whether the rapid anti-depressive effects can be maintained over longer periods and self-administered application modes can be developed [58]. In view of our findings, amantadine appeared the by far more promising option compared to ketamine. Provided the early drop of suicidal behaviour holds true in larger RCTs, it could help saving patients\u2019 lives. At least, earlier suggested adverse safety effects considering short-term psychotropic effects [5] could be ruled out. Likewise, the unexpectedly long 12-months post-study sustainability of beneficial amantadine therapy argued against mainly short-term psychotropic modes of action, the more since reduced severity and duration of further depressive episodes correlated with dropped cumulative infection measures over time (p < 0.001).",

With respect to whole Group A, even 80% were responders after cross-over. This was doubling the primary response of patients to placebo treatment in Period I (35.3%) (Group P).

However, due to amantadine\u2019s known antidepressant effects [5], the main mode of action needs to be further clarified. Notably, amantadine had also been shown to have significant anti-manic effects in BDV-infected bipolar I or bipolar II inpatients in a pilot trial. The overall symptom reduction after 18 days was 79.2% (p < 0.001), and the treatment was well-tolerated [61]. Anti-manic efficacy of amantadine was unexpected given its reported pharmacological properties [5]. This argued again in favour of the drug\u2019s anti-BDV capacity eliciting anti-manic clinical effects, even though reduced blood BDV activities could not be measured due to the too short observation period [61].",

We could demonstrate a strong quantitative relationship of pre-treatment CIC and AB with PAG. Similarly validated assay results using the same EIA system were recently reported in a Lithuanian study [62]. In our trial, pre-treatment PAG- and CIC-levels correlated with AB-level reduction in the first treatment period. Notably, the initial infection load (PAG and AB) had a strong significant predictive value for short-term clinical improvement (primary response; RDHAMD) after 7 weeks. In contrast to these direct virus and host-derived variables, pre-treatment levels of their combined product (CIC) displayed no correlation to the short-term clinical improvement, but did so on the long run. Decreased CIC together with decreased PAG and AB correlated with 12-months post study clinical improvements.

In practical terms, an important outcome of our study revealed that high PAG and AB levels in depressed patients could predict who will be likely to benefit from antiviral treatment. In so far, the study provided clear correlative evidence for a significant contribution of the infection to depression. The antiviral in vivo efficacy of amantadine had been previously demonstrated independently of clinical effects in remitted BDV-1 infected patients with affective disorders, applying a double-blind placebo-controlled design over 14 weeks.

An attempt to question specificity reported failure to detect antigens [69], but used an inappropriate procedural approach, and did not determine through parallel experiments using recombinant proteins whether his approach met the same detection level (1.5\u20133.0 ng antigen/mL) achieved in our antigen-EIA [47].

            "text": "In conclusion, infection variables prior and post amantadine therapy were shown to be interlocked with clinical outcomes, supporting the rationale of cross-linking BDV-1 infection with depression. However, the extent to which the antidepressant efficacy of amantadine is based on its antiviral capacity against BDV-1 infection in vivo, needs to be further evaluated. This could be addressed in future studies using other antivirals with known anti-BDV-1 but lacking antidepressant effects, such as the nucleoside analogues ribavirin and favipiravir (T-705). Early ribavirin in vitro studies had used human OL cells and rat glia cells (C6) persistently infected with laboratory strains V and He/80, respectively. They found a > 90% titre decline in both cell/virus systems within 3 days, applying 20 \u03bcM ribavirin up to 13 days, but a rapid virus recovery within 2 days after drug removal [70]. Recently, favipiravir, a new potent antiviral drug against a wide spectrum of viruses, was shown to be more effective than ribavirin against BDV-1. Favipiravir rapidly reduced BDV-1 infection at 200\u2013400 \u03bcM to almost undetectable levels by 21 days using a recombinant virus system in Vero cells, and natural virus in OL cells persistently infected with He/80 at 400 \u03bcM by 28 days [71]. Equivalent in vivo plasma levels of favipiravir (446 \u03bcM; 70 \u03bcg/mL) have been successfully applied in a lethal non-human primate model against Ebola virus disease, reducing the median viral load at day 7 by 2\u20133 logs [72]. In contrast to amantadine, however, the clinical application of both these drugs is associated with the risk of significant adverse effects. With respect to ribavirin, namely headache, fever, muscle pain and irritable mood were known, the latter most unfavourable in the treatment of depressed patients. Favipiravir has a risk of dose-related haemolytic anaemia, teratogenicity, and embryo-toxicity.",

            "text": "To further address the rationale of a mainly antiviral mode of action for amantadine, we extended in vitro efficacy studies of amantadine (1-aminoadamantane) to the closely related derivative memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane). Alike amantadine, memantine came into focus as low affinity non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist with neuroprotective activity, but failed to show antidepressant effects in double-blind placebo- controlled RCTs [73, 74]. Here, we could show in vitro that amantadine was able to prevent infection (ID50) of rabbit cells with human BDV strain Hu-H1 [20] at concentrations as low as 2.4 to 10 ng/mL (0.005 to 0.025 \u03bcM), while memantine failed up to a 100,000 fold higher concentration (200 \u03bcg/mL; 500 \u03bcM). Interestingly, the in vitro medium dose of amantadine which abrogated replication of the same human strain by 4 weeks (0.4 \u03bcg/mL; 1 \u03bcM), corresponded exactly to the in vivo blood level achieved through the dose of 200 mg amantadine orally daily applied in patients of our trial. In contrast, laboratory-adapted str. V [14] was insensitive to amantadine treatment up to the highest dose of 1.2 \u03bcg/mL (3 \u03bcM), consistent with largely different biological properties of natural and non-natural strains [22, 23]. It should be noted that the remarkable insensitivity of BDV-1 laboratory strains observed earlier by different researchers [75\u201377], had quite a while led to a general questioning of amantadine\u2019s anti-BDV efficacy. Here, we could finally dispel anybody\u2019s doubts by demonstrating the fundamental differences between a natural human isolate and a highly adapted laboratory strain in parallel in vitro experiments. Virus-host differences had also been suggested to impact the antiviral potency of ribavirin, even though only two laboratory strains with comparable adaptations had been compared [70].",

Memantine neither acted as antiviral in vitro, nor elicited antidepressant efficacy above placebo [73, 74], whereas amantadine did so in this and previous open trials [6\u20138]. It therefore appears plausible that amantadine\u2019s contrasting bipartite capacity may be part of a common chief mode of action, unrelated to that of memantine. Notably, experimental animal evidence suggested a key impact of BDV-1 infection on the glutamate system, targeting non-NMDA receptors of the kainate-type (KARs), specifically KA1 [78]. KARs were thought to be involved in neuronal plasticity, indispensable for memory functioning and learning [79, 80]. This would be consistent with cognitive deficiencies found earlier in BDV-1 infected rats [81]. Against this background, it appeared not too speculative that depression, amantadine, and BDV-1 infection might be linked through crosstalk at different glutamate receptor sites.",
