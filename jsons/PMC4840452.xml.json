Intestinal tissues from each ileal compartment, including the PPs, were collected from all animals (n = 5) at one month post-infection (age = 40\u201344 days) and prepared for transcriptome profiling using RNA-Seq. A total of 300,676,396 paired-end sequence reads were obtained from the 10 samples. On average, ~89% of these reads were mapped to the bovine reference genome (UMD3.1, Supplementary Table S1). The quality of RNA-Seq data was evaluated via the genomic regions of reads, the RNA-Seq 3\u2032/5\u2032 bias and the sequencing depth. Approximately 78% of the reads were derived from exonic and intronic regions, gene upstream and downstream regions, whereas 22% were derived from intergenic regions (Fig. 1A,B). In addition, the coverage of reads along each transcript revealed no noticeable 3\u2032/5\u2032 bias, confirming the acceptable quality of sequencing data (Fig. 1C). The number of detected genes increased along with increasing sequencing reads and the gene number eventually plateaud, revealing that the most expressed genes were detected by RNA-Seq (Fig. 1D).",

There were 16 genes that displayed significantly different alternative splicing events between control and infected compartments of all four animals (Supplementary Table S3). Among them, an alternative first exon event was detected (adjusted P < 0.05, Fisher\u2019s exact test, \u0394PSI > 10%) in the mRNA of monocyte to macrophage differentiation-associated (MMD) (Fig. 4A). In MAP-infected tissues, the expression (fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads (FPKM)) of exon 1A (the first annotated exon in bovine genome UMD 3.1) decreased among all 4 animals (log2FPKM in MAP-infected vs. log2FPKM in control: 6.0 vs. 3.8 in Animal #1; 5.6 vs. 4.3 in Animal #2; 5.8 vs. 4.6 in Animal #3; 6.0 vs. 4.2 in Animal #4) (Fig. 4A), while the expression of exon 1B (the alternatively spliced form for the first exon) increased in all animals (log2FPKM in MAP-infected vs. log2FPKM in control: 1.3 vs. 3.6 in Animal #1; 1.5 vs. 3.2 in Animal #2; 1.7 vs. 3.1 in Animal #3; 1.0 vs. 3.4 in Animal #4) when compared to control tissues (Fig. 4A). In addition, an intron retention event was detected (adjusted P < 0.05, Fisher\u2019s exact test, \u0394PSI > 10%) in adenosine deaminase (ADA) transcript (Fig. 4B). A higher expression of intron 4 (intron region between exon 4 and exon 5 of the ADA mRNA) were detected in MAP-infected tissues among all 4 animals, compared to that of control tissues (log2FPKM in MAP-infected vs. log2FPKM in control: 1.7 vs. 0.8 in Animal #1; 1.2 vs. 2.4 in Animal #2; 0.7 vs. 2.0 in Animal #3; 0.5 vs. 1.9 in Animal #4) (Fig. 4B). Subsequently, further protein sequence analysis (translate RNA sequence to protein sequence) on the above alternative spliced forms of MMD and ADA mRNAs in infected tissues revealed the potential introduction of stop codons, when the detected alternative splicing events happen (Supplementary Table S4). The multiplex reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was further performed to verify the differences between MAP-infected and control tissues in alternative spliced forms of above two genes. The primers and probes were designed to target the identical isoforms that were detected by RNA-Seq. Using the primers and probes designed; only two isoforms were detected for both genes (data not shown). The ratio between the expression of isoform 1 (exon 1A + exon 2) and isoform 2 (exon 1B + exon 2) for MMD decreased significantly (P = 0.0031, paired t-test) in infected tissues (0.21 \u00b1 0.05) when compared to control tissues (0.10 \u00b1 0.05) (Fig. 4C). Similarly, the ratio between the expression of isoform 1 (exon 4 + exon 5) and isoform 2 (exon 4 + intron 4 + exon 5) for ADA decreased significantly (P = 0.037, paired t-test) in infected tissues (8.26 \u00b1 4.02) when compared to control tissues (1.48 \u00b1 0.48) (Fig. 4D).

Our analysis reveals that alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs may be a potential mechanism by which MAP evades macrophage killing by altering macrophage maturation and lysosome functions. Especially, MMD, a marker gene of macrophages maturation22, displayed an increased frequency for an abnormal first exon that could disrupt protein synthesis in the infected tissues, when compared to control tissues. MMD is an ion channel protein and decreased synthesis of this protein may block macrophage maturation23. Furthermore, retention of the fourth intron in ADA mRNA can produce a truncated protein, resulting in defective lysosome functions24. Together, these two splice variants can result in a failure of macrophage maturation and lysosome function, reducing MAP clearance from the site of infection during the early stage of infection. Changes in alternative splicing events following bacterial (Escherichia coli, in vitro), viral (Sendai virus, in vitro), and parasite (Crithidia bombi, in insect) infections have been reported previously, but the impacts of splice variants on protein expression levels are not well studied18252627. Thus, it is necessary to confirm that these two alternative splicing events observed in the present study impact macrophage protein expression levels during MAP infection, in vitro and in vivo. It is worth to mention that the alternative splicing data presented in this study is preliminary due to the high variations among individuals and lacking of the validation at protein expression level. Besides, RT-qPCR results revealed higher expression of the abnormal isoform of MMD (expression of isoform 1/expression of isoform 2 < 1) in both MAP-infected and control samples comparing to those detected by RNA-seq. Although RNA-Seq detected the increase of the abnormal isoform of MMD in MAP-infected tissues, it revealed higher expression of normal isoform of MMD in both MAP-infected and control samples. Such controversy between RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR may due to the inaccuracy of RNA-Seq in detection of low abundant transcripts, since it has been reported that RNA-Seq cannot accurately detected the abundance of transcripts that have reads number less than 10028.",

            "text": "In addition to the influence on macrophages, MAP infection also may have altered toll-like receptor (TLRs) signalling pathway and downstream inflammatory responses by altering miRNAs expression. The expression of miR-146 b, which inhibits the activity of intermediate molecules of the TLR-pathway, such as interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 2 (IRAK2) and TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)29 was significantly increased in infected tissues. The upregulation (fold change = 3.22) of miR-146 b in infected ileum may be one of the mechanisms by which MAP disrupts TLR signalling, following the infection. This is consistent with a previous in vivo study that reported inhibition of the TLR signalling pathway at 12 hours after MAP infection in the ileum30. Our results suggest that subversion of TLR signalling may be sustained throughout a persistent MAP infection and increased production of miR-146 b may play a key role in this process. There were no significant differences in the expression of TLR signalling molecules (IRAK1, IRAK2 and TRAF6) at the mRNA level, when comparing infected and control compartments. It is still possible, however, that protein expression of these molecules may have been reduced due to post-transcriptional regulation by miR-146 b. Future studies using antibodies to detect TLR signalling molecules (miR-146 b target genes) in MAP-infected tissues may provide in depth understanding on the role of miR-146 b during early infection. Moreover, miR-146 b was negatively correlated with its predicted target genes, interleukin 4-receptor (IL4R) (r = \u22120.67, P < 0.01) and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) (r = \u22120.59, P < 0.01). SYK activates the NF-\u03baB-mediated transcription of cytokines3132. Their negative correlation with miR-146 b indicates that inflammatory responses triggered via the TLR-signalling pathway may also be inhibited by miR-146 b. These observations suggest that miR-146 b may be able to regulate host responses to MAP infection at multiple stages. Overall, the miRNA results provide further supporting evidences to a previous study reporting the inhibition of TLR-signalling pathway and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, following MAP infection1.",

            "text": "The RNA-Seq data also suggested that the most relevant function of DE genes in infected ileum was related to \u201cendothelial cell proliferation\u201d. The upregulation of genes, such as cadherin 13 (CDH13), semaphorin 6B (SEMA6B), dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and integrin alpha 1 (ITGA1), are consistent with increased proliferation of endothelial cells in the infected tissues3334353637. Activation of endothelial cell proliferation was also suggested by the detected changes in miRNA expression. We identified four DE miRNAs, including miR-1247, miR-137, miR-196 b, and miR-433, with target genes involved in \u201cproliferation of endothelial cells\u201d. For example, increased expression of miR-196 b, an ileum-specific miRNA in young calves38, has been reported to increase endothelial cell proliferation in cancer39. It is intriguing to consider the possibility that the tissue specificity of this miRNA in the gastrointestinal tract of young calves may contribute to the proclivity for MAP infections to persist in the ileal region of the small intestine. Furthermore, the negative correlation between miR-196 b and secreted protein, acidic, cysteine-rich (SPARC) (r = \u22120.65, P < 0.05), an inhibitor of the proliferation of endothelial cells40, suggests that upregulation of miR-196 b in infected tissues may increase the proliferation of endothelial cells by inhibiting SPARC expression. Proliferation of endothelial cells after MAP infection is one of the causes of granuloma formation6, which is a significant feature of JD in ruminants1. Granulomas mainly consist of MAP-infected macrophages and provide an organized and protected microenvironment within which MAP can establish a persistent infection in the host41. Although, no granulomas were histologically visible at one-month post-infection in our study (data not shown), a previous study reported that granulomas were observed at 3 to 4 weeks after mycobacteria infection42. Nevertheless, this study revealed that MAP infection promotes endothelial cell proliferation by changing both mRNA and miRNA expression at the site of infection and these transcriptional changes may support granuloma formation during a persistent infection of MAP.",

This observation is consistent with a previous study that reported the absence of detectable immune responses during the subclinical stage of MAP infection in ileum43. The proliferation of regulatory T cells was proposed as a potential mechanism for the suppression of an adaptive immune response43. However, similar to Roussey and colleagues44, our analysis did not reveal any significant transcriptional changes related to T cell function at one-month post-infection. More detailed studies are required to determine whether there is either the induction of adaptive immune responses in the ileal PPs or recruitment of mucosal effector cells to the site of MAP infection during the subclinical stage of disease.",

            "text": "Pathogen infection leads to host metabolic changes to meet the increasing energy demand associated with a variety of defense responses. Moreover, the pathogenicity of MAP is determined by its capacity to adapt central metabolism to utilize host-derived nutrients45. Thus, a persistent MAP infection may alter host metabolism at the site of infection and decrease nutrient absorption by granuloma formation. One of the host metabolic responses during an infection is the increased level of glucose consumption by innate immune cells, such as macrophages and this demand is met by glycogenolysis in muscle tissues, which breakdown stored glycogen into glucose46. Macrophages utilize glucose to produce reactive oxygen species when phagolysosome activity is increased for clearance of intracellular pathogens, which can deplete stored glycogen in infected tissues46. The transcriptome profiling revealed both a disruption in macrophage functions and a potential disruption of glucose metabolism in the MAP infected ileal compartment. Twenty-one DE genes observed in the present study that were related to glucose metabolism disorders revealed a downregulation in glycogen breakdown into glucose. This suggests a reduction in glycogenolysis or increased glycogen reserves in tissue with MAP infection. To validate these potential changes in host energy metabolism and their link to the MAP infection, we measured glycogen concentrations in MAP infected and control ileal tissues. Glycogen concentrations were increased in infected (0.35 \u00b1 0.10 \u03bcmol/g tissue) vs. control (0.27 \u00b1 0.044 \u03bcmol/g tissue) tissues, but this change was not statistically significant. Moreover, glycogen concentrations in the MAP infected compartments were positively correlated (r = 0.9, P = 0.04) with the expression of ADA. This observation suggests a possible link between increased glycogen production and genes related to lysosome functions. It will be necessary, however, to follow these changes throughout a longer course of infection to substantiate a causal link between glycogen accumulation and truncated-ADA protein production during MAP infection.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the present study provides insights into new molecular regulatory mechanisms by which MAP may evade host immune responses during the early subclinical stage of infection. We identified DE miRNAs and alternative splicing events that may contribute to host molecular regulatory mechanisms that permit persistent MAP infection during early stage. The surgically isolated intestinal segment model system enabled identification of significant changes between infected and non-infected ileum tissues within the same animal. The overall effect of MAP infection on mRNA expression was limited at one-month post-infection, and DE genes were primarily related to \u201cendothelial cell proliferation\u201d. Furthermore, two genes related to macrophage function (MMD, ADA) were confirmed to be differentially spliced in MAP-infected compartments, suggesting a possible mechanism by which MAP escapes the host innate immune response. Profiling miRNA expression revealed that miRNAs might be more responsive than mRNA during the early stage of MAP infection. The integration of DE miRNA with DE mRNAs revealed potential miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs (miR-196 b and SPARC; miR-146 b and IL4R; miR-146 b and SYK) that were related to MAP-associated changes in \u201cendothelial cell proliferation\u201d, \u201cbacteria recognition\u201d, and \u201cactivation of inflammatory responses\u201d. These miRNAs, especially if they are released into the circulation system from infected tissues, may provide potential biomarkers to diagnose subclinical-stage MAP infection. Future studies are needed to further validate the alternative splicing isoform changes at the protein level, to identify the changes in the morphology or number of endothelial cells, and to explore the mechanisms that miRNA regulated mRNA expression in the MAP-infected ileum tissue during the same early infection stage as well as in the later infection stages.",

Five male, Holstein calves that were 10\u201314 days old were inoculated with MAP using surgically isolated intestinal segments. Briefly, a 30\u201335-cm segment of intestine was surgically isolated, proximal to the ileo-cecal fold, and subdivided into three equal compartments using silk ligatures. The distal compartments were injected with 1 \u2212 3 \u00d7 108 CFU of MAP strain K10 in a final volume of 5 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The proximal compartment of the intestinal segment was injected with 5 ml PBS. After surgery, calves were treated with 1.1 mg/kg flunixin (Banamine; Schering Plough Canada Inc., Pointe Claire, Quebec, Canada) for 3 days and with 3 to 4 mg/kg enrofloxacin (Baytril; Bayer Inc.) for 5 days. Calves were fed a whole-milk diet for 4 weeks. One-month post-infection, tissues from the distal (infected) and proximal (control) compartments were collected immediately after euthanizing calves. Each intestinal compartment was opened longitudinally, the contents removed, and longitudinal strips of intestinal tissue measuring 0.5 cm by 3 cm were collected into cryovials, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at \u221280 \u00b0C.",
