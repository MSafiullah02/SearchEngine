Due to the severe ARDS unresponsive to assisted non-invasive ventilation the patient underwent ETI and was transferred to an isolation ward of the intensive care unit (ICU); the infection of SARS-CoV-2 virus was confirmed thereafter by an RT-PCR assay of a nasal swab. After few days of mechanical ventilation, the patient suddenly developed a cardiac arrest followed, after resuscitation, by acute hemodynamic deterioration. Urgent echocardiography showed a severe dysfunction of the right cardiac chambers highly suggestive for acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Due to rapid deterioration of the hemodynamic condition a CT-scan was not performed, and he was immediately transferred to our cardiac surgery room. Moreover, the need for isolation in dedicated COVID-positive units or hospitals may limit access to examinations such as ECG, echocardiography or CT-scan and hemodynamic instability can be dismissed because of the widespread viral organ involvement (3, 4) .",

Current management of significant PE is focused in reducing clot size through systemic/catheter directed thrombolysis or removing the clot entirely with percutaneous suction or surgical embolectomy (6) . The American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) suggest surgical embolectomy in case of hemodynamic instability or failed/ contraindications to thrombolysis, patent foramen ovale, thrombus in transit in the right sided cardiac chambers and also patient that are predicted to die before realizing the benefits of thrombolytics (7) . In our patient the rapid progressive hemodynamic deterioration forced us to an urgent surgical approach aimed to achieve complete clots removal. A systemic thrombolysis could have been certainly easier, but we believe that in such unstable condition was unlikely to offer the same effective and prompt hemodynamic improvement.",

The complete clots removal resulted in a rapid improvement in pulmonary artery systolic pressure. The intervention was performed using 59 minutes of cardioplegic arrest with a mild hypothermia. Patient was under hydroxichloroquine sulfate and INN-Darunavir plus Cobicistat as pharmacological therapy. At 32-days of follow-up he is in stable hemodynamic conditions without any inotropic support and has been transferred from ICU in regular ward in spontaneous ventilation. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been resolved as confirmed by two RT-PCR assays of nasal swab. COMMENT Out from our knowledge this is the first report of interstitial SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia complicated by massive acute PE. The prolonged immobilization associated with respiratory failure, dehydration combined with sepsis and pro-coagulant condition of the acute infection might expose SARS-CoV-2 patients to increased risk of severe complications including acute PE.",
