Metagenomic surveys of viral communities exemplify the high diversity and varying origins of microbes in wastewater, with sequences from over 50 different viral families recovered, as well as numerous sequences too divergent to classify [2, 5] . DNA metagenomes from wastewater are dominated by unknown sequences and bacteriophage sequences that likely represent viruses infecting gut bacteria, while RNA metagenomes contain eukaryotic viruses infecting plants (Virgaviridae family; likely of dietary origin), followed by viruses infecting humans, insects, and rats. While wastewater is dominated by microbes that are not pathogenic to humans, there are many types of viruses, bacteria, protozoan parasites, and helminth worms that can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, are waterborne, and cause human infections of varying severity and symptoms (e.g. respiratory, encephalitis, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, dermatitis) ( Fig. 1A ; [1, 3, 4, 6] ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 185, "end": 188, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 465, "end": 468, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 469, "end": 472, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 473, "end": 476, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 477, "end": 480, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 720, "end": 723, "text": "[2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 724, "end": 726, "text": "5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1421, "end": 1424, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1427, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1428, "end": 1430, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1433, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1411, "end": 1418, "text": "Fig. 1A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Microbial diversity of wastewater"}, {"text": "Presently, norovirus and rotavirus (viruses), Salmonella and Campylobacter (bacteria), Ascaris (helminth), and Cryptosporidium (unicellular parasite) are among the most prevalent and widespread known human/zoonotic enteric pathogens [1, 3, 4, 6] . However, the emergence of additional waterborne pathogens (e.g. microsporidia, mycobacteria, parvoviruses, coronaviruses, picornaviruses) is of growing concern [7, 8] . The frequent lack of an identifiable etiological agent of gastrointestinal (GI) illness (reviewed in [9] ) and the prevalence of novel viruses dominating sewage [10, 11] further highlights the threat of additional pathogens present in wastewater to public health and economic productivity. Given the high incidence and concentration of pathogens in feces and wastewater, it is not surprising that the World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes acute gastroenteritis as one of the leading causes of human morbidity and mortality worldwide [12] . Furthermore, it is estimated that enteric viruses, particularly norovirus and rotavirus, are largely responsible for these infections and deaths due to their resistance to typical methods of disinfection, low infectious dose, and long persistence in the environment and on fomites [3, 4, 7, 13] . Since as few as 18 viral particles can cause infection, an individual infected with norovirus can excrete up to five billion infectious doses (e.g. 10 5 -10 11 viral copies/g feces) into wastewater [13] . Given the high impact of enteric viruses on public health, this commentary will focus on the relation of enteric viruses to current and emerging paradigms in water quality monitoring, current methods used for enteric virus detection, and the growing need for methodological improvements (Fig. 1 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 233, "end": 236, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 237, "end": 239, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 240, "end": 242, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 243, "end": 245, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 408, "end": 411, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 412, "end": 414, "text": "8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 518, "end": 521, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 578, "end": 582, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 583, "end": 586, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 955, "end": 959, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1246, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1249, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1252, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1256, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1457, "end": 1461, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1751, "end": 1758, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Human pathogens in wastewater"}, {"text": "The main sources of fecal pollution into surface waters include feces and shedding by wild and domestic animals, domestic wastewater, and direct shedding during human recreation (Fig. 1A) . According to the WHO, improvements in water management could alleviate 10% of the worldwide disease burden, resulting in net savings of approximately US$ 72.7 billion each year until Millennium Development Goals for improved sanitation and drinking water are met [10] . Although developing countries suffer disproportionately from enteric pathogen-associated mortality and morbidity, illness due to enteric infections still has significant impacts on health and socioeconomics in developed countries with advanced wastewater and drinking water treatment [12, 14] . Therefore, a primary, longstanding goal for protecting human health worldwide is accurate identification of the presence of wastewater pollution and prediction of risks to the public associated with contaminated drinking, shellfish harvesting, and recreational waters. Since the early 1900s, non-pathogenic enteric bacteria (FIB; e.g. Enterococcus, fecal coliforms, and Escherichia coli) have been used throughout the world as indicators for the presence of enteric pathogens and have been utilized for subsequent prediction of human health risk due to microbial pathogens ( Fig. 1B ; [14] [15] [16] [17] ). The traditional monitoring approach for recreational water management depends upon routine monitoring of FIB using culture-based methods and subsequent beach closures when FIB concentrations exceed allowable limits. FIB concentrations are also used to determine microbial quality of both treated and untreated wastewater and to calculate the associated health risks associated with reuse in agriculture [1] . For example, the 2006 WHO guidelines suggest using quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRA), with an assumed ratio of 0.1-1 human norovirus or rotavirus per 10 5 E. coli, to calculate human health risk of viral infection from wastewater reuse in agriculture. Although this method is known to be flawed (see below), FIB are still widely used as an indicator of enteric pathogens and human health risks due to their consistent presence in wastewater and the readily available, low cost, culture-based methods for detection that require minimal laboratory training [14] [15] [16] [17] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 453, "end": 457, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 744, "end": 748, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 749, "end": 752, "text": "14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1340, "end": 1344, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1345, "end": 1349, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1350, "end": 1354, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1359, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1766, "end": 1769, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 2340, "end": 2344, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2345, "end": 2349, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2350, "end": 2354, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2355, "end": 2359, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 178, "end": 187, "text": "(Fig. 1A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1330, "end": 1337, "text": "Fig. 1B", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Water quality monitoring 2.1 Traditional monitoring approach with FIB"}, {"text": "Despite their convenience and widespread use, it has been recognized since 1979 that FIB do not consistently correlate with the presence of enteric pathogens, particularly those that are not bacteria, or with human health risks in any water matrix (Table 1 ; [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] ). Even with the introduction of quantitative PCR (qPCR) to measure FIB, the lack of a consistent correlation between FIB and human health risks continues to hold true in the majority of studies. One exception is a recent study that demonstrated a correlation between qPCR-derived Enterococcus concentrations and the incidence of GI illness due to recreational activities at a beach exposed to pointsource wastewater pollution [18] . The general lack of correlation between FIB and enteric viruses is not surprising due to differences in stability and persistence of these microbes. In comparison to enteric viruses, FIB are more susceptible to wastewater and drinking Simple, Rapid Virus Detection Needed to Complement Current Technologies water treatment, are excreted by all warm-blooded animals, and have higher die-off rates in the environment, even though they can replicate and persist in the sediment after a contamination event (Fig. 1A) . Drinking water, shellfish harvesting areas, recreational water, and wastewater designated for reuse that are considered safe based upon FIB concentrations can actually contain high concentrations of human enteric viruses [10, 15-17, 20, 21] . Furthermore, FIB-based QMRAs for wastewater reuse have been shown to greatly underestimate the risk of norovirus illness; in one study, actual norovirus concentrations were 1000-fold greater than those predicted by the FIB-norovirus ratio [21] . The lack of an indicator to encompass all sources of fecal pollution and the heterogeneous distribution of FIB as well as their highly variable ratio with nonbacterial pathogens in wastewater and environmental waters has significantly hindered improvements in microbial safety related to drinking water, wastewater reuse, shellfish consumption, and recreational waters [14, 15, 22 ].", "cite_spans": [{"start": 259, "end": 263, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 264, "end": 268, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 269, "end": 273, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 274, "end": 278, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 279, "end": 283, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 284, "end": 288, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 289, "end": 293, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 721, "end": 725, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1464, "end": 1483, "text": "[10, 15-17, 20, 21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1725, "end": 1729, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 2101, "end": 2105, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 2106, "end": 2109, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 2110, "end": 2112, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 248, "end": 256, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1231, "end": 1240, "text": "(Fig. 1A)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Shortcomings of the current FIB paradigm"}, {"text": "As a result of the inadequacy of FIB monitoring to determine human health risks associated with enteric pathogens, particularly viruses, alternative approaches to traditional microbial quality monitoring have been recommended (Fig. 1C) . These holistic approaches incorporate sanitary surveys that inform water quality studies, which directly quantify reference pathogens (e.g. norovirus, rotavirus) and drive exploratory QMRA and subsequent management decisions [6, 15, 19, 21, 23, 24] . Three main lines of evidence suggest that this approach will improve water quality monitoring efforts. First, the power of incorporating actual enteric virus measurements into exploratory QMRAs with multiple scenarios for driving site-specific microbial safety guidelines for recreational waters was recently demonstrated [15] . Similarly, the need to quantify enteric virus concentrations and resulting health risks was also highlighted to improve QMRAs for wastewater reuse and consequent public health guidelines [21] . Finally, the utility of incorporating specific enteric viruses and/or a viral indicator to identify wastewater pollution/poor microbial quality and to better predict human health risks related to wastewater exposure has been demonstrated throughout the world [14-16, 22, 24, 25] . Furthermore, improvements in microbial safety depend on improved treatment processes, enteric pathogen modeling, and QMRAs that directly measure reference enteric viruses and/or an improved viral indicator instead of relying upon FIB-to-model pathogen ratios [3, 15, 19-21, 23, 24] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 463, "end": 466, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 467, "end": 470, "text": "15,", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 471, "end": 474, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 475, "end": 478, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 479, "end": 482, "text": "23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 483, "end": 486, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 811, "end": 815, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1005, "end": 1009, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1271, "end": 1290, "text": "[14-16, 22, 24, 25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1552, "end": 1574, "text": "[3, 15, 19-21, 23, 24]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 226, "end": 235, "text": "(Fig. 1C)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Emerging holistic management approach"}, {"text": "Due to the hypervariability of environmental persistence and epidemiology of individual enteric viruses, it is unlikely that a single viral indicator will be sufficient to represent all enteric viruses [7, 14, 22, 25] .

Additionally, several different bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria), particularly F-specific RNA coliphages, have been proposed as indicators for enteric viruses (reviewed in [22] ); however, none reliably correlate with the presence of enteric viruses in the environment or throughout disinfection processes [16, 17, 20, 25] . The fairly consistent, relatively high concentrations of adenoviruses and polyomaviruses in wastewater make them possible indicator viruses (Table 1) ; however, their low concentrations in contaminated environments still present methodological difficulties for detection [3, 14, 16] . Metagenomic studies have shown the dominance of plant viruses (family Virgaviridae) in human feces and wastewater [2, 5, 11, 27] . Consequently, the use of a pepper plant pathogen, pepper mild mottle virus, has also been proposed as an alternative enteric virus indicator due to its high concentration in wastewater (average 10 6 particles/mL) and dietary (i.e., human infection-independent) origin in feces [14, 25, 26, 28] .

Additionally, the availability of userfriendly, point-of-use tests will enable individuals to ensure their own microbial safety.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "World Health Organization, WHO Guidelines for the Safe Use of Wastewater, Excreta, and Greywater", "authors": [], "year": 2006, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Raw Sewage Harbors Diverse Viral Populations", "authors": [{"first": "P", "middle": ["G"], "last": "Cantalupo", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "Calgua", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Zhao", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Hundesa", "suffix": ""}], "year": null, "venue": "mBio", "volume": "2011", "issn": "5", "pages": "180--00111", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Molecular Detection of Pathogens in Water -the Pros and Cons of Molecular Techniques", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Girones", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Ferr\u00fas", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Alonso", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Rodriguez-Manzano", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2010, "venue": "Water Res", "volume": "", "issn": "15", "pages": "4325--4339", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Waterborne Human Pathogenic Viruses of Public Health Concern", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Ganesh", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Lin", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2013, "venue": "Int.
