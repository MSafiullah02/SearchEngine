Real-time data is noisy and very often hampered by systematic errors in reporting. Detailed epidemic models may contain a large number of empirical parameters, which cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we show that the cumulative number of deaths can be regarded as a master variable, and the parameters of the epidemic such as the basic reproduction number, the size of the susceptible population, and the infection rate can be determined. In the SIR model, we derive an explicit single variable differential equation for the evolution of the cumulative number of fatalities. We show that the epidemic in Spain, Italy, and Hubei Province, China follows this master equation closely. We discuss the relationship with the logistic growth model, and we show that it is a good approximation when the basic reproduction number is less than 2.3. This condition is valid for the outbreak in Hubei, but not for the outbreaks in Spain, Italy, and New York. The difference is in the shorter infectious period in China, probably due to the separation policy of the infected. For more complex models, with more internal variables, such as the SEIR model, the equations derived from the SIR model remain valid approximately, due to the separation of timescales.",

In this situation, low dimensional, effective models of epidemic dynamics with the least number of variables and parameters are needed for robust modeling and forecasting [6] . Such models naturally arise in statistical mechanics, where the behavior of coupled micro-systems with many parameters and variables, can be reduced to the dynamics of a few macroscopic variables on large scales.",

Similarly, the number of recovered patients is dependent on the case definition, which in turn depends on the testing protocol and frequency. The number of fatalities seems to be a better characteristic. Even if there can be differences in various administrative districts, how the deaths are counted, we can hope that it is done consistently, and the relative numbers are accurate even if the total number can be debated. There is also some variability in this data, and sometimes deaths appear in the statistics with a few days delay.

To get data points right from its peak, we have to look at examples where the outbreak passed its peak (at the time of the writing on April 17, 2020). We have found only three cases where this already happened with great certainty: China, Italy, and Spain. In these countries, a lockdown has been implemented, and the disease can spread only in a small fraction of society, where infected people are locked down with susceptible ones. The rest of society is not in contact with the epidemic. The number of people affected is N , and if all of them get infected, N D = pN people expected to die. The value of p is unknown. It is estimated [7] from the data of countries, where there is extensive testing in places such as South Korea (p \u2248 0.02) and Iceland (p \u2248 0.004). We expect to extract the parameters \u03b2, \u03b3 and the number of people in danger of dying D max . In Fig.2 , we show the daily number of fatalities as a function of cumulative deaths for Spain, Italy, and New York. We also fit our model to the data and showed the parameters in Table1. The parameters are very similar for all three cases. The parameter 1/\u03b3 \u2248 17 days is in good agreement with the typical length of the disease till recovery or death. The basic reproduction number R 0 \u2248 5 is somewhat elevated, but it is also realistic for people in close contact with the infected (for example, family members and doctors) in the lockdown situation. According to the model, the lockdown works as expected. We have to stress, that in absence of a complete lockdown and social distancing, this otcome is not guaranteed and the epidemic can change its course when social distancing is lifted.",

What can be the explanation for these differences in the parameters? For example, the recovery time 1/\u03b3 \u2248 6 days is much shorter than the natural recovery period observed in Europe and New York. The likely explanation is that the lockdown in China has been implemented differently. Once someone tested positive or symptoms appeared, they got immediately separated and isolated in designated quarantine facilities. This way, the period in which the patient could infect others has been reduced to an average of 6 days from 17 days in Europe and New York. The basic reproduction number fell accordingly.",
