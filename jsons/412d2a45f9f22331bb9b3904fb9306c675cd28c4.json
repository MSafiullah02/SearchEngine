The results illustrated that roscovitine inhibited multiple subtypes of influenza strains dose-dependently, including A/WSN/1933(H1N1), A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) and A/FM1/47 (H1N1) with IC 50 value of 3.35 \u00b1 0.39, 7.01 \u00b1 1.84 and 5.99 \u00b1 1.89 mM, respectively. Moreover, roscovitine suppressed the gene transcription and genome replication steps in the viral life cycle. Further mechanistic studies indicated that roscovitine reduced viral polymerase activity and bound specifically to the viral PB2cap protein by fluorescence polarization assay (FP) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Therefore, we believed roscovitine, as a PB2cap inhibitor, was a prospective antiviral agent to be developed as therapeutic treatment against influenza A virus infection.",

It tends to come during the winter season and often times swing across countries over the course of months as an epidemic, causing significant morbidity and mortality as the patients may develop severe respiratory infections, pneumonia, meningitis, etc. In addition to a direct impact of the virus itself, influenza also may bring complications such as bacterial super-infections and cardiovascular events that cause numerous infected individuals death [1] . New strains of the influenza virus can be transmitted from animals to human, and the virus often evolved rapidly over time, which makes vaccine development more difficult in general. On the other hand, because of continuous antigenic drift and antigenic shifts in the influenza viral surface glycoproteins, a vaccine formulated for one subtype of influenza maybe ineffective in the following year due to a new epidemic strain. Hence, human influenza viruses continue to pose important threats to human health in the modern society. Various prevention and treatment methods of influenza have been widely studied around the world.",

However, both classes of drugs face the increased drug resistance challenge. Thus, despite the utility of these antiviral drugs, novel antivirals are in demand due to the emergence of adverse effects and the increased resistance of new influenza strains. For example, the US FDA approved Xofluza (baloxavir marboxil), an influenza virus polymerase inhibitor, for the treatment of influenza with symptoms of less than 48 h in people at the age of 12 or over.",

We conducted the further experiments with A/WSN/1933(H1N1) virus strain. Compared with viral infection group, the cytopathic effect (CPE) was decreased significantly (Fig. 1b) . Besides, the number of plaques, the expression of viral mRNA and fluorescent spots showed the analogous downward trend in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1cee) . Furthermore, at 12 h and 24 h post-infection, the expression of viral NP and PB2 protein were reduced obviously (Fig. 1f) . Simultaneously, an obvious reduction in the progeny viral particles of the roscovitine-treated supernatant was observed by plaque assay (Fig. 1g) .

As reported previously [8] , one life cycle of the influenza virus was around 8-10 h, and was divided into three main steps: virus entry (0-2 h), viral gene transcription and genome replication (2-8 h) and progeny viral release (8-10 h). To explore the period of viral life cycle disturbed by roscovitine, Beas-2B cells were treated with roscovitine at different time intervals during one viral life cycle (Fig. 2a) . As shown in Fig. 2b and c, the compound could greatly lessen the expression level both viral protein and mRNA at 2-5 h or 5-8 h time interval, indicating it blocked viral gene transcription and genome replication stage. Because of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) playing an important role in viral genome transcription and replication stage, we conjectured the antiviral ability was relevant to interfere with viral RdRp activity.",

Under the treatment of above host factors inhibitors, the process of influenza virus snatching 5 0cap structures from host's pre-mRNAs synthesized by RNAP-II will be affected. Therefore, we supposed roscovitine may exert antivirus by inhibiting RNAP-II activity. To confirm this, we explored the phosphorylation level of carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) to estimate the effect on RNAP-II. As shown in Fig. 3a , roscovitine played weakly inhibition ability of the CTD-ser2 domain up to 20 mM, whereas the viral M2 protein expression markedly reduced at 2.5 mM.

As showed in Fig. 3b , the activity of reporter gene decreased in a dosedependent manner, revealing that roscovitine inhibited polymerase activity. The viral RdRp is one part of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). Once translocated in the nucleus, the primary roles of vRNPs are to transcribe viral mRNAs for the production of viral proteins and to replicate full-length complementary genomic RNA (cRNA) for amplification of vRNA and generation of progeny vRNPs [10] . Therefore, the synthesis of vRNA and cRNA will be affected when the activity of viral RdRp is cut down.

            "text": "With the rapid evolving and stealthy spreading mechanism of different subtypes of influenza, it is essential to explore possible antiviral chemicals against the viruses. Meanwhile, novel antiviral drugs development is an important complementary tool in addition to vaccines, aiming to improve therapeutic efficiency and reduce the drug resistance. However, drug development is an expensive, risky, labor-intensive and time-consuming process. It usually takes 10-15 years on average and costs a billion dollars or more to complete a development process [13] . Therefore, it is indispensable to exploit alternative use of existing drugs that have been on the market and approved for indications on other diseases, as well as drug candidates under clinical trials. Roscovitine has been reported to act on a wide variety of cancer cell lines and induce apoptosis. Moreover, it is currently considered as a potential drug to treat neurodegenerative and retinal degeneration diseases, lung inflammation and kidney diseases. Besides, the compound was also shown to inhibit HSV and HIV infection [14] . Thus, it is regarded as an efficient potential drug candidate. In this paper, we focused on the antiviral effect of roscovitine on IAVs and demonstrated its antiviral activity as a promising PB2cap inhibitor.",

            "text": "Generally, IAVs possess a single-stranded, eight-segmented RNA genome of negative polarity (vRNA) and accomplish one life cycle including viral attachment, entry, gene transcription and genome replication, packaging of progeny viruses and release period [15] . After virus entry in the host cell, vRNP complexes are imported in the nucleus, where transcription and replication take place. The vRNP complexes constitute the core of the virus and consist of RdRp, NP and vRNA segments, representing the minimal transcriptional and replicative machinery of influenza [10, 16] . RdRp of IAVs is highly conserved among all strains and subtypes during evolution. As a new drug class for antiviral therapy in patients with influenza, the RdRp inhibitors are characterized by continuous effective activity and great patient compliance [17] . For instance, Xofluza inhibits viral replication by targeting the endonuclease function encoded by the PA subunit of the viral RdRp and was approved by the FDA in October 2018, which represents a novel mechanism of action being studied and approved in almost two decades [18] . In this article, we found roscovitine exerted the antiviral effect by targeting to virus itself, and as a competitive inhibitor, it could diminish the combination of FITC-m7GTP with PB2cap (Fig. 4a) . PB2 subunit is one part of RdRP and plays a critical role in the initiation of transcription by binding to 5 0 -cap domain of host pre-mRNAs, called cap-snatching process. The PB2 subunit cap-binding domain (PB2cap, residues 318e483) is responsible for the binding ability and considered a valid target for development of new anti-influenza compounds [19] . VX-787 presents broadspectrum anti-influenza activity by disrupting PB2 cap-binding activity [20] . Furthermore, the PB2cap antivirals may considerably minimized the emergence of escape mutants, which are urgently indispensable on the edge of a new devastating pandemic. According to this study, roscovitine might influence PB2cap function to exert antiviral activity by FP assay. Next, SPR assay was used to further confirm the result. And the binding ability of roscovitine was approximately 60-fold stronger with PB2cap than that of positive compound D715-2441, a PB2cap inhibitor we reported previouly ( Fig. 4b and Fig. S5 ). Molecular docking in this study demonstrated that it bound to the cap-binding pocket of PB2 via the residues Phe-323, His-357, Lys-376, Phe-404, Met-431 (Fig. 4c) , consistent with a part of m7GTP-binding residues [19] .",

What's more, roscovitine disturbs viral replication by targeting viral conserved sites of PB2cap. Notably, as a drug candidate, roscovitine has gone through several phase I and II clinical trials with good safety profiles for cancer therapy, and there are plenty of antiviral activity studies conducted on roscovitine as well. Thus, exploring the therapeutic effect of roscovitine in the treatment of influenza is feasible and promising. Furthermore, re-investigating the existing kinase inhibitors as potential antivirals and finding its potential mechanism may provide a wide application prospect against viral infection disease, such as influenza A virus infection, as well as the coming pandemic COVID-19 disease, which caused by another RNA virus, the SARS-CoV-2.",
