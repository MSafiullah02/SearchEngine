            "text": "The central nervous system (CNS) is an immune privileged organ because of the lack of endogenous dendritic cells (DCs) (Ransohoff et al., 2003). In many pathological conditions including stroke, traumatic injury, encephalitis, and demyelinating autoimmune disorders, however, a massive infiltration of peripheral immune cells occurs in the CNS. Although natural killer (NK) cell-related gene expression is readily detected within the CNS (Bryceson et al., 2005; Lund et al., 2007), evidence of direct demonstration of the presence of NK cells in human CNS tissues is still lacking. This is partly because of the lack of suitable antibodies for staining human NK cells in situ (see Chapter 31). Visualization of NK cells in mouse brains during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was achieved using anti-NK1.1 mAb (PK136) (Hammarberg et al., 2000). Antibodies such as Ly49 have been successfully used for staining NK cells in lymphoid organs (O\u2019Leary et al., 2006). Suitability of these antibodies for staining CNS NK cells needs to be verified in additional studies.",

            "text": "Although direct visualization of NK cells in CNS tissues is technically challenging, there is little doubt that NK cells, as with other types of lymphocytes, enter the CNS during inflammatory processes. In fact, it has been reported that NK cells are among the earliest recruited cells during adoptive transfer EAE (Kerfoot and Kubes, 2002; Wekerle and Fierz, 1985). Chemokine receptors such as CCR2, CCR5, CXCR3, CX3CR1 as well as lysophospholipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are involved in the rapid NK-cell mobilization that occurs in inflammatory conditions (Ajuebor et al., 2007; Hokeness et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2006; Inngjerdingen et al., 2001; Jiang et al., 2004; Khan et al., 2006; Kveberg et al., 2002; Lavergne et al., 2003; Martin-Fontecha et al., 2004; Thapa et al., 2007; Wald et al., 2006; Walzer et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2007), and several of these chemokine receptors (CCR5, CX3CR1) are directly involved in NK cell homing to the CNS (Huang et al., 2006; Martin-Fontecha et al., 2004; Thapa et al., 2007). The biological implication of chemokine-guided homing of NK cells during CNS inflammation is discussed in greater detail in the following section.",

Initially, it was demonstrated that NK cells could readily kill syngeneic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons by a perforin-dependent mechanism (Backstrom et al., 2000, Backstrom et al., 2003). Ventral spinal cord neurons and hippocampal neurons of the CNS were resistant to lysis. The resistance to NK cell-mediated lysis of the latter neurons was not related to protection by MHC class I molecules, since similar \u03b22-micro-globulin\u2212/\u2212 neurons were equally resistant to lysis (Backstrom et al., 2003).",

The prerequisite for NK cell killing is its activation via signalling from activating receptor ligand pathways. NK cell activation generally appears to be elicited by a distinct set of molecules that have weak homology with MHC class I molecules. The activating receptor NKG2D which differs dramatically from other NKG2 receptor proteins is of particular interest since it, in contrast to other NK cell-activating receptors, is constitutively expressed on NK cells. The endogenous ligand of NKG2D in the mouse was recently identified as retinoic acid early inducible gene-1 (RAE-1)-encoded proteins and minor histocompatibility antigen H60 (Cerwenka et al., 2000; Diefenbach et al., 2000; Malarkannan et al., 1998\n). Differential expression of NKG2D and its ligand on neuronal cells from the peripheral system or the CNS appears a key mechanism underlying variable susceptibility to NK lyses. RAE-1, the product of which is a ligand for the NK cell-activating receptor NKG2D, was expressed at high levels in the DRG neurons. In contrast, RAE-1 was expressed only at very low levels in the resistant CNS-derived neurons. Blocking NK cells with anti-NKG2D antibodies inhibited NK cell-mediated killing of the DRG neurons.",

Indeed, progressive motor and sensory neuropathy developed in a patient with chronic NK cell lymphocytosis (CNKL) (Noguchi et al., 2005). A sural nerve biopsy revealed infiltration of NK cells into the nerve fascicles, and demyelinating changes with secondary axonal degeneration. The infiltrating NK cells were adjacent to myelinated fibres, showing damage of Schwann cell membranes. Treatment with oral prednisolone resulted in rapid improvement of sensory disturbance and weakness with a significant decrease of NK cells in the blood and disappearance of the conduction block. These observations suggest that the infiltrating NK cells may directly damage myelin and Schwann cells, thus causing demyelination.",

The migration of NK cells to the CNS during inflammatory responses and lack of inhibitory signal MHC class I expression within the CNS invites prediction that direct cytolytic effects of NK cells contribute to oligodendrocyte damage and demyelination to CNS diseases such as MS. Antel and colleagues demonstrated using in vitro assays that human oligodendrocytes, as well as other glial elements (astrocytes, microglia), were susceptible to injury mediated by peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cell preparations (MNCs), which were enriched for NK cells by depleting CD3+, with or without CD19+ cells through the use of either magnetic beads or cell sorting (Antel et al., 1998; Morse et al., 2001). Cytotoxic effects of the NK cell-enriched effectors were dependant on pre-exposure of these cells to IL-2. Furthermore, it was found that autologous oligodendrocytes were as susceptible to injury mediated by IL-2-activated NK cells as were heterogonous oligodendrocytes.",

In addition to direct cytotoxicity, cytokine release by NK cells may also participate in tissue damage as well as in regulating T cell immune responses. Interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by T cells and NK cells that has been implicated as a deleterious factor in MS, the immune-mediated demyelinating disorder. In vitro, purified developing and mature oligodendrocytes die in the presence of IFN-\u03b3 by apoptosis and necrosis, respectively. Transgenic expression of PLP/SOCS1 (proteolipid protein regulating suppressor of cytokine signalling 1), brings about diminished oligodendrocyte responsiveness to IFN-\u03b3 attributable to the targeted expression of SOCS1 in these cells (Balabanov et al., 2006). Consequently, oligodendrocytes in the PLP/SOCS1 transgenic mice are protected against the injurious effect of IFN-\u03b3. Although both NK cells and T cells produce IFN-\u03b3, NK cells are the principal sources of early IFN-\u03b3 production prior to T cell activation. This time kinetic might be particularly relevant for early oligodendrocyte damage during inflammation.",

Infection of susceptible mice (SJL) with TMEV causes a biphasic disease characterized by grey matter inflammation followed by late chronic demyelination (Roos and Wollmann, 1984; Rosenthal et al., 1986). After inoculation, CNS TMEV titres were higher in SJL mice compared with C57BL/10 mice, correlating with a 50% lower NK cell activity in the SJL mice than in the C57BL/10 mice (Paya et al., 1989). Clinically, SJL mice are much more susceptible than C57BL/10 mice to TMEV. When resistant (C57BL/10) mice were depleted of NK cells using either mAb NK1.1 or polyclonal anti-asialo-GM1, TMEV induced the development of diffuse encephalitis and meningitis early in the post-infection period. However, the second phase of TMEV-induced CNS disease (demyelination) was observed only in resistant C57BL/10 mice treated with anti-asialo-GM1. Experiments with beige/beige mice of C57BL/10 background showed a mild degree of grey matter inflammation but no demyelination (Paya et al., 1989). NK cells are critical effectors in protecting against TMEV-induced grey matter disease, whereas a different population of either NK1.1\u2013NK cells, or other activated lymphocytes, may be critical in resistance or susceptibility to demyelination.",

Typically, infection results in a life-long latent infection of the host (Halioua and Malkin, 1999; Whitley, 2002). The transmission of HSV-2 in the human population includes asymptomatic shedding of the virus even in the presence of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and the production of a viral glycoprotein that indirectly elicits NK cell death (Bellner et al., 2005; Posavad et al., 2000; Wald et al., 2000). In a mouse model of HSV-2 infection, it was shown that mice deficient in CCR5 (CCR5\u2212/\u2212) displayed a significant reduction in cumulative survival following infection in comparison with wild-type HSV-2\u2013infected controls. Associated with decreased resistance to viral infection, CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice yielded significantly more virus and expressed higher levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), CXCL1, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5 in the vagina, spinal cord, and/or brain stem than did wild-type mice. In addition, when comparing wild-type HSV-2\u2013infected mice with CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice prior to or after infection, there were significantly more NK cells (NK1.1+ CD3\u2212) residing in the brain stem and spleen of infected wild-type mice. Functionally, NK activity from cells isolated from the brain stem of HSV-2\u2013infected wild-type mice was greater than that from HSV-2\u2013infected CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice. Further, antibody-mediated depletion of NK cells resulted in an increase in HSV-2 levels in the vaginal, spinal cord and brain stem tissue of wild-type mice but not CCR5\u2212/\u2212 mice (Kveberg et al., 2002). Collectively, the absence of CCR5 expression significantly impacts the ability of the host to control genital HSV-2 infection, inflammation and spread associated with a specific reduction in NK cell expansion, infiltration and activity in the nervous system.",

Susceptibility of the pregnant host to toxoplasmosis may be attributable to a type 2-cytokine bias that is maintained during gestation (Shirahata et al., 1992). Cell-mediated immune responses involving CD4 and CD8T cells and NK cells play a protective role in T. gondii primary infection (Goldszmid et al., 2007; Scharton-Kersten et al., 1998; Scorza et al., 2003; Scott and Trinchieri, 1995; Subauste et al., 1992). To clarify the roles of NK cells and IFN-\u03b3 in protection against primary congenital toxoplasmosis, Abou-Bacar and colleagues (2004) used recombination activating gene 2 knockout (KO) (RAG-2\u2212/\u2212) mice, which lack T and B lymphocytes, in comparison with the wild-type BALB/c model. RAG-2\u2212/\u2212 mice had a significantly lower risk of foetal toxoplasmosis than BALB/c mice. This protection was associated with an increased number of maternal NK cells, IFN-\u03b3 secretion by spleen cells, and decreased parasitemia. In the RAG-2\u2212/\u2212 mice, NK cell depletion increased the rate of foetal infection. These data suggest that a partially protective immunity against congenital toxoplasmosis is achieved owing to the increased number of NK cells in RAG-2\u2212/\u2212 mice (Abou-Bacar et al., 2004). Protective effect of NK cells was confirmed in another study using the SCID model (Kang and Suzuki, 2001).",

Malignant melanoma is the third most common type of cancer that metastasizes to the brain (Prins et al., 2006), which presents clinicians with few treatment options. Although nearly a dozen melanoma antigens specifically recognized by T cells have been identified, melanoma cells are still able to avoid immune destruction in most instances. Because the generation of an effective anti-tumour immune response requires both the presence of foreign antigen and a costimulatory molecule or signal, tumour cells displaying tumour antigens may avoid immune detection because of the absence of appropriate costimulation. Thus, anti-tumour immune responses might be achieved by more effective local delivery of costimulatory molecules. Activation and expansion of NK cells may independently lyse tumour cells, or provide T cells with costimulatory molecules including cytokines, and overall enhance antigen presentation to T cells.",

The specific receptor for IL-2 on NK cells allows several approaches to deliver IL-2 intrathecally and activate NK cells. Ewend and associates carried out a study in C57BL/6 mice that were simultaneously given intracranial injections of tumour and of irradiated B16F10 melanoma cells transduced to secrete IL-2 (Prins et al., 2006). IL-2 therapy generated antitumour responses capable of extending the survival of animals that received simultaneous intracranial tumour challenges either locally or at distant sites in the brain. Non-transduced melanoma cells had little effect. Elimination of T-cell and NK subsets using gene KO mice and antibody-depletion techniques demonstrated that NK cells were most important for the initial anti-tumour response, whereas CD4+ T cells were not necessary. These studies demonstrate that local IL-2 therapy in the brain not only generates an immediate local antitumour immune response, but also establishes long-term immunologic memory capable of eliminating subsequent tumour challenges within and outside of the CNS. Furthermore, the antitumour response to paracrine IL-2 in the brain differed significantly from that in the flank, suggesting that the intrinsic CNS cells involved in initiating immunity within the brain have different cytokine requirements from their peripheral counterparts.",

As receptors governing NK cell action and effector functions are being elucidated, more sophisticated means of manipulating NK cells have been generated.

Accordingly, activating the innate immune system by forcing glioma cells to express danger signals such as NKG2D ligands is a promising strategy of immunotherapy for these tumours. The remaining challenges would be to down-regulate HLA-E expression on glioma cells and suppress production of TGF-\u03b2 by glioma.

Consequently, the function of myelin sheaths becomes compromised and neurological impairment occurs. The pathogenesis of MS is mirrored, in part, in EAE, which can be induced in susceptible strains of mice with neuron-antigens and complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant. The roles of NK cells in the pathogenesis of MS and EAE have been investigated. In patients with MS, NK cells (CD56 and CD57) are present in the peripheral blood with reduced numbers and cytolytic activity (Shibatomi et al., 2001; Trinchieri, 1989). This finding is not unique to MS and similar phenotype of NK cells have been documented in many other types of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, etc (Shibatomi et al., 2001). In parallel, patients with MS and other autoimmune diseases have defective functions of \u2018regulatory cells\u2019, including NKT cells and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) (La Cava et al., 2006). A reduced number and/or compromised function of NK cells, NKT cells and Treg cells invite a hypothesis that autoimmunity is associated with a result of global defective regulatory cell functions in these patients.\n",

CX3CR1 is expressed almost exclusively by CNS glial cells (Boehme et al., 2000; Cardona et al., 2006). Thus, germ-line deletion of CX3CR1 leads to impaired homing of NK cells to the CNS. This model would be ideal in addressing CNS inflammation/autoimmunity in relation to NK cells. Interestingly, upon immunization, CX3CR1-deficient mice with reduced NK cells in the CNS and intact NK cells in the periphery developed their wild-type controls. Thus, lack of CNS NK cells alone is sufficient to cause exacerbated CNS inflammation and autoimmunity (Huang et al., 2006). It is also conceivable that chemokine guided NK cell homing to CNS might serve as pathway that can be therapeutically targeted (Figure 28.1\n).",

In these patients or in EAE animals, NK cells may contribute to the demyelination through bystander damage while controlling the infection.

A close survey of the literature reveals multiple steps where NK cells can regulate inflammation and intervene in the loss of self-tolerance. Importantly, the findings also caution against inferring a similar role for NK cells in all types of autoimmune phenomena or during separate stages of the same disease (Flodstrom et al., 2002; Yokoyama and Plougastel, 2003). NK cells can both promote and inhibit autoreactive T cells. These possibilities have been extensively reviewed recently (Shi and Van Kaer, 2006). The specific CNS anatomical location, as reflected by diverse CNS APCs and multiple antigens may also influence the outcome of autoimmunity. As with EAE, it appears that NK cells control T cell proliferation in an antigen non-specific manner, both in the periphery and within the CNS (Shi, et al., unpublished). Recently, it has been demonstrated that human NK cells kill resting but not activated microglia via NKG2D- and NKp46-mediated recognition (L\u00fcnemann et al., 2008). This study emphasizes the potential importance of interactions between NK cells and CNS resident APCs. However, whether the regulatory effects of NK cells can be attributed to the action of NK cells on APCs, directly on T cells, or both, is not known and currently under investigation.",

This process is tightly controlled by a number of chemokines and chemokine receptors. There is ample of evidence that NK cells within the CNS contribute to the control of infections and might limit progression of certain tumours. Bystander neuronal and/or glial cell damage can occur. In certain autoimmune conditions of the CNS, NK cells appear to have an inhibitory role. Activation and expansion of NK cells through engaging IL-2 receptors on NK cells not only inhibit several CNS tumours, but also might slow the progression of MS and other autoimmune diseases (Bielekova et al., 2006; Li et al., 2005). Furthermore, the ability of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 to ameliorate MS in humans and IFN-\u03b3 to inhibit EAE in mice may reflect the ability of these cytokines to transiently activate NK-dependent regulatory responses. However, because IFN treatment also upregulates Qa-1 expression on T cells (Ota et al., 2005), the short duration and usually modest nature of these therapeutic effects may reflect a Qa-1-dependent decrease in NK cell activation and associated immunoregulatory activity (Lu et al., 2007).",
