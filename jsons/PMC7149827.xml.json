In impoverished urban populations in South America, ARI symptoms may be present on an almost continuous basis, making it difficult to determine symptom-free days and estimate attack rates.3, 4 The most striking disparity between developing and developed countries with regard to ARI epidemiology is the case-fatality rate of lower respiratory infection (LRI), mainly pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and influenza,5, 6 in children under 5 years of age, which may reach 16% in some areas.1\n",

Except for a few more recent reports, human rhinovirus (HRV) and human coronaviruses (HCoV) have not been tested in prospective studies conducted in tropical countries. A pathogenic role has been well established for most respiratory viruses, but there is considerable overlap of clinical and pathological features between different viral diseases. Therefore, a direct role of certain viruses in the pathogenesis of a specific respiratory illness is not possible to establish on clinical grounds, which is further complicated when multiple respiratory viruses are detected simultaneously in the same specimen.22 Detecting viral genomes in respiratory secretions does not necessarily correlate with viral replication and may reflect latency or prolonged shedding unrelated to the current symptoms. Therefore, approaches based on the detection of viable viral progeny or markers of active viral replication should be used in studies of pathogenesis of respiratory viruses.",

In influenza A viruses, the envelope M2 protein serves as an ion channel that facilitates RNA release. Transcription of the negative-strand genomic RNA into positive-strand messenger RNA (mRNA) and complementary RNA (cRNA) is mediated by a viral RNA polymerase complex in the nucleus. cRNA serves as a template for the synthesis of negative-strand RNA genome segments, and mRNA directs viral protein synthesis. Newly assembled nucleocapsids acquire an envelope as they bud through the cell surface and only viruses with a full set of genome segments are infectious.35\n",

Recent studies show that temperature and humidity play a central role in the timing of influenza circulation in Brazil, where the seasonal wave of influenza activity travels southward from the sparsely populated equatorial region to the densely populated southeast.45 High temperature and humidity tend to reduce aerosol transmission of influenza virus46 and thus the reproduction number of influenza outbreaks in tropical regions is reduced as compared to temperate areas.47\n",

By July, there were nearly 90 000 laboratory confirmed cases and 382 confirmed deaths globally. The 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 displaced seasonal influenza A(H1N1) and generated fear that its crude mortality rate could surpass that of seasonal influenza in a population lacking neutralizing antibodies. However, total mortality was comparable to that attributed to seasonal influenza, with most deaths associated with predisposing conditions, such as obesity and underlying pulmonary disease, although severe disease was seen with unusually high frequency in younger ages and pregnant women, with a case-fatality rate less than 0.5%.53\n",

The severity of illness broadly correlates with upper respiratory tract viral loads. Constitutional influenza symptoms are due in part to the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Levels of interferon (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), interleukins and chemokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, MCP-10, MIP-1\u03b1 and MIP-1\u03b2) are increased in nasal secretions, and IFN, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 are increased in blood in human influenza.36 The tissue tropism of a strain of influenza virus depends, among other factors, on a combination of susceptibility of its HA to be cleaved by, and tissue availability of, proteases, thus rendering the virus infectious.59 Extrapulmonary dissemination of virus has been uncommonly documented in humans, but systemic spread is a regular feature of highly pathogenic avian viruses in chickens and sometimes in rodents or other mammalian hosts. Serum and secretory antibodies directed to HA and NA appear 10 days post infection and correlate with durable protection against reinfection by homologous strain. Vaccine-induced protection may last for up to 2\u20133 years against homotypic virus. Infection also induces cell-mediated immunity detectable 3\u20136 days later, which seems to be important for recovery.36 Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response against internal proteins may provide some degree of heterosubtypic immunity.",

Amantadine is excreted in an unchanged state in the urine, while rimantadine is extensively metabolized after absorption and less than 10% of the dose is excreted unchanged in the urine. Elderly persons need only half the dose to achieve similar plasma levels. Amantadine or rimantadine may cause gastrointestinal upset and central nervous system (CNS) side effects. CNS intolerance is more common with amantadine and, when severe, can be manifested as agitation, psychosis, seizures, and coma. Mild complaints include insomnia, dizziness, anxiety, dry mouth, anorexia, and nausea and are reversible upon discontinuation. Amantadine and rimantadine are marketed as 100 mg tablets and 10 mg/mL syrup. The recommended dose is 100 mg twice daily for adults <65 years of age (100 mg per day for patients \u226565 years). For children under 10, a rimantadine dose of 5 mg/kg per day (maximum, 150 mg per day) has been suggested.37 Dose reductions proportional to the creatinine clearance (ClCr) are suggested for patients with renal insufficiency (amantadine for ClCr less than 60\u201380 mL/min/1.73 m2; rimantadine for ClCr less than 10\u201320 mL/min/1.73 m2). Resistance of seasonal influenza A viruses to adamantanes, due to single nucleotide mutation in the M2 gene, is widespread,65, 66, 67 leading the CDC to recommend the suspension of their use in the United States in 2006.",

Zanamivir is generally well tolerated, but may rarely induce bronchospasm, particularly in those with influenza and preexisting airways disease.37 Oral oseltamivir treatment dosage for adults and children older than 12 months and weigh more than 40 kg is 75 mg twice a day for 5 days, but may need an extended period if the patient is immunocompromised. Oseltamivir dosing is reduced to 60 mg twice a day for children weighing 23\u201340 kg; for 15\u201323 kg, dosing is 45 mg twice a day; if <15 kg, then 30 mg twice a day. For infants 3\u201312 months of age, the recommended oseltamivir dose is 3 mg/kg twice a day. For infants <3 months, data are limited in this age group, but a 3 mg/kg dose twice a day would be recommended in the severely ill. The goal of early implementation of antiviral treatment is to reduce illness severity, shorten time to resumption of daily activities by 1\u20133 days, and reduce complications leading to antibiotic prescription and hospitalizations by 50% in adults. In children 1\u201312 years of age, oseltamivir reduces the frequency of otitis media and, consequently, antibiotic prescriptions. Side effects include mild nausea or emesis. Dosage of NAIs does not need to be adjusted for the elderly;36 however, a dosage reduction is required for patients with creatinine clearance <30.",

During the 2007\u20132008 influenza season, unexpectedly high rates of primary resistance to oseltamivir were detected predominantly in Europe, associated with H274Y mutation in the NA gene. Oseltamivir-resistant viruses remain susceptible to zanamivir and adamantanes.70, 71, 72, 73 For 2008\u20132009 seasonal influenza A(H1N1), treatment recommendations should include zanamivir or combination treatments for those at high risk for sequelae of influenza.74 In 2009, the CDC recommended that zanamivir, or a combination of oseltamivir and rimantadine, are more appropriate options than oseltamivir or amantadine alone for the treatment of seasonal influenza A(H1N1).75 The majority of the 2009 A(H1N1) pandemic viruses were susceptible to NAI; but there are sporadic cases of oseltamivir resistance, 80% of them in viruses from patients with prior exposure to oseltamivir therapy or prophylaxis.34 Recommendations for the clinical management of 2009 H1N1 infections have been proposed by the WHO.76 In addition to H274Y mutation, a mutation at amino acid 136 of the influenza virus A(H1N1) NA protein has been linked to reduced susceptibility to zanamivir.77 Rapidly emerging influenza viruses resistant to NAI highlight the need for development of novel antiviral agents for the treatment and prevention of influenza virus infections. Peramivir, a new NAI for parenteral use, is currently undergoing clinical trials with promising results.78 Novel therapeutic approaches currently under study are T-705, a selective inhibitor of influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,79 and DAS181, a sialidase fusion protein.80, 81\n",

Approved prophylaxis dose is once daily (i.e., one half of treatment dose) for oseltamivir or zanamivir which should be started as early as possible and continued for 7\u201310 days for post-exposure prophylaxis.76 However, reports of high rates of influenza resistance to antiviral drugs should prompt more rigorous judgment in the decision to use antiviral prophylaxis. Antiviral agents, especially the neuraminidase inhibitors, could significantly help in the control of a future pandemic of influenza, by reducing lower respiratory complications, hospitalizations, and person-to-person transmission. Availability of antivirals also pose a limitation in resource-constraint settings.87 Therefore, policies to ensure a stockpile of these drugs, as well as directions to optimize their use, are important issues to be considered.32\n",

The most frequent HRSV illness in children over 3 years of age and adults is characterized by symptoms of URI often with low-grade fever. Exacerbations of chronic pulmonary diseases and wheezing episodes can also be seen in adults.110 Neurological complications including seizures and encephalopathy occur rarely in severe HRSV infections requiring intensive care.111 HRSV, as well as influenza and parainfluenza, also contributes to wheezing and asthma exacerbations in infants.112, 113, 114, 115 HRSV has also been increasingly recognized in LRI in the elderly, mainly interstitial pneumonia, with prolonged cough and dyspnea in patients with chronic pulmonary conditions.116\n",

Replication in the bronchiolar epithelium causes necrosis of ciliated cells, syncytia formation, peribronchiolar inflammation with abundant lymphocytes and macrophages, impairment of secretion clearance, small airway obstruction and lung hyperaeration.89 HRSV nonstructural proteins NS1 and NS2 counteract production of type I interferon (IFN), contributing to pathogenesis.117 HRSV may also modulate surfactant expression in human pulmonary epithelial cells, which can contribute for disease severity.118 Pneumonia frequently coexists with bronchiolitis, evidenced by interstitial mononuclear infiltrate, eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions in epithelial cells, and multinucleated giant cells. The innate immune response to HRSV is triggered by recognition via Toll-like receptor (TLR)4, TLR3, TLR2 and RIG-I, resulting in expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.119 HRSV infects dendritic cells (DCs), causing them to lose their ability to stimulate HRSV-specific T cells.120 B-lymphocyte-stimulating factors derived from infected DC and epithelial cells are determinants of the mucosal antibody response and disease progression.121\n",

For example, the genomic variant B7h was associated with fatal lower respiratory disease in a study in South America.259 Adenoviruses may cause persistent infection in epithelial and lymphoid cells and this helps to keep viral circulation in the population.244 HAdV glycoprotein E3 interferes with expression of class I MHC molecules, reducing display of viral epitopes on cell surface and contributing to persistence.260 In addition, HAdV protein E1A inhibits interferon response and reduces HAdV-induced apoptosis of infected cells.261\n",

Pathogenesis studies have been hampered by the lack of growth of the virus in routine cell cultures and of experimental animal models of infection, hence Koch's postulates have not been fulfilled. Furthermore, detection of HBoV in asymptomatic individuals or in association with other respiratory viruses with established pathogenic potential complicates the diagnosis.217, 281 However, similar to other parvoviruses, HBoV may cause persistent infection with prolonged shedding.282 HBoV causes viremia, which is uncommon in other respiratory viral infections.274 HBoV DNA has been found in 32% of tonsils and adenoids removed from children.283 HBoV DNA has been detected as single agent in feces from 0.8\u20137.8% of children with gastroenteritis without ARI symptoms.277, 278, 284, 285 The role of immune response in pathogenesis and protection against infection remains unclear; but both Th1 and Th2 cytokines are increased in children with bronchiolitis and HBoV.286\n",
