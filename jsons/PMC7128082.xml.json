For solid feces, place a very small sample into a drop of saline on the slide, and mix with a wooden applicator stick. For samples obtained by rectal lavage, simply place a drop of the lavage fluid on the slide. Place a cover glass over the drop. The wet mount should be thin enough to read newsprint through it. Too much feces will make a dense mixture that cannot be assessed. When examining the slide, adjust the contrast to see the minute aspects of the specimen.1 Scan the entire slide at low magnification (ie, 10\u00d7) for eggs, cysts, and larvae. Trophozoites are generally identified at 20\u00d7 and 40\u00d7 magnification, while motile bacteria may be assessed 100x under oil emersion.1 After initial examination, iodine may be wicked under an edge of the cover glass to stain organisms. Iodine will kill motile organisms but may aid in their identification. Motile organisms seen on wet mount can often be structurally assessed on stained, dry mount slides.1 Wet mount slides should not be sent to pathologists because they will rapidly dry and become unreadable. Instead, send dry mounts with a clear description of your findings on the wet mount.5\n",

Prepare the slide with a very small amount of fresh feces. It is a common mistake to make fecal smears too thick. Thick areas do not stain well and tend to fall off during processing. Solid feces should be mixed with saline, as discussed in \u201cWet Mounts\u201d section, or a drop of rectal lavage fluid may be placed directly on the slide.1, 5 The sample should be spread thinly and evenly across the slide, using the same smearing technique as preparing blood smears. The slide should be air-dried, not heat fixed, to preserve cellular morphology. Stain the slide with wright-Giemsa or Diff-Quik (Hamilton Thorne Biosciences, Beverly, MA). If necessary, a portable hair dryer can be used to speed the drying process.5 Scan the entire slide at low magnification. Cellular morphology and bacteria are best assessed at 100\u00d7 magnification under oil. Consider special stains based on initial fecal cytology and the clinical presentation. For better bacterial morphology, consider Gram stain. If there is a clinical suspicion of cryptosporidiosis, consider acid-fast stain. Slides that are to be preserved for later reexamination may be fixed with methanol for later staining or processed with a fixative stain, such as merthiolate iodine-formalin.1, 5\n",

Samples may be mixed for analysis to save money. An ELISA is used to detect antigen in feces. The assessment of a single stool sample approaches but is not higher than the diagnostic sensitivity of 3 zinc sulfate floats. Similar indirect immunofluorescence assays are also available. Motile flagellated trophozoites may be detected on wet mount cytology of fresh feces (<5 minutes) or duodenal fluid. Sensitivity of this method is low because trophozoites are intermittently shed, and only a small amount of feces is examined. Giardia may be confused with other motile trophozoites, such as trichomonads. However, they may be identified by their characteristic bouncing motion.

They can also be identified on dry-mount cytology (Fig 6).9 Because not all Serpulina spp are pathogenic, diagnosis requires identification of typical organisms on cytology, a consistent clinical presentation, and elimination of other possible etiologies.24 It is important to differentiate Serpulina spp from motile treponeme-like spirochetes. S pilosicoli may be identified by ELISA and PCR methods in research settings.24 Complete response to antibacterial therapy within 2 to 3 days may support the diagnosis.9\n",

The specificity of the assay is good, but it cannot differentiate vaccine strains of Parvovirus from virulent strains. This leads to false-positive tests after vaccination.
