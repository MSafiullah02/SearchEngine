The principal design of transformation vectors is similar in both phylogenetic groups. Although important additions to the list of species transformed in their plastomes have been made in algae and in higher plants, the key organisms in the area are still the two species, in which stable plastid transformation was initially successful, i.e., Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and tobacco. Basic research into organelle biology has substantially benefited from the homologous recombination-based capability to precisely insert at predetermined loci, delete, disrupt, or exchange plastid genome sequences. Successful expression of recombinant proteins, including pharmaceutical proteins, has been demonstrated in Chlamydomonas as well as in higher plants, where some interesting agronomic traits were also engineered through plastid transformation.",

            "text": "Plants are defined as the organisms containing plastids. Plant cells are operating and functioning through the integrated expression networks of nuclear, mitochondrial, and plastid genes. The capability of using genetic transformation for changing components of the integrated networks allows -in basic research -to study the interplay between the different genomes. In applied research, genetic transformation can optimize plants for their performance in natural or artificial environments and can introduce new functions such as the production of recombinant proteins or novel metabolites. Stable genetic transformation of plastids was first introduced for Chlamydomonas almost 20 years ago (Boynton et al. 1988; Blowers et al. 1989) , and was successfully applied to the higher plant Nicotiana tabacum L. (tobacco) soon afterwards (Svab et al. 1990 ). In both species transformation involves a single or very few plastid DNA molecules initially, which leads to cells or organisms containing genetically different plastomes. These are termed \"heteroplasmic\" (Fig. 1) . Distribution of plastid DNA molecules (and, in higher plants, plastids) among the daughter cells originating from mitosis is a statistical process. As a consequence, segregation of different plastid DNA molecules occurs. Under appropriate selection this process leads to cells (organisms) containing only transformed plastomes, which are called \"homoplasmic\" (Fig. 1) . Several hundred original scientific reports and numerous reviews (Table 1 ) on research in the area have been published in the meantime. This review attempts at serving as a reference article and at providing an actual update on this research.",

            "text": "The basic technology of genetic transformation of plastids was developed for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and most of the technical features, like transfer of DNA via particle bombardment and some of the selection markers used, were directly applicable for higher plants. One could argue therefore that Chlamydomonas can serve as a model for plastid transformation in higher plants. This view is attractive since, due to the presence of only one plastid per cell and the much shorter generation time, in Chlamydomonas it takes only four to six weeks to reach homoplasmy, where in tobacco four to six months are necessary. As pointed out by Maliga (1993) , there are however some important differences in plastid biology between single-celled algae and higher plants, which need to be kept in mind when trying to directly transfer techniques between the different groups of organisms. These differences include, e.g., the size of the genome and the genes present, the number of genome copies per cell, and the number of nucleoids per plastid. The morphology and intracellular location of plastids, and the occurrence of tissue specific plastid forms in higher plants are further differences. Furthermore, the fate of plastids before and after fertilization, the option to switch between photoautotrophic, mixotrophic and heterotrophic growth conditions in Chlamydomonas, whereas the target tissues for plastid transformation in higher plants always are heterotrophic in vitro cultures, and, finally, the shorter time to reach homoplasmy ( Fig. 1 ) in the single-celled alga as compared to higher plants (Table 2) are also factors different in the two model systems.

            "text": "Stably transformed lines have primarily been generated by using two methods to deliver transforming DNA into plastids, the particle gun-mediated biolistic process and treatment of isolated protoplasts with polyethylene glycol (PEG) [for a detailed description of the particle bombardment process see e.g. Boynton et al. 1988; Lutz et al. 2006a; for PEG treatment, see Kofer et al. 1998a) ]. The mechanism of entry of the transforming DNA is assumed to be by mechanical impact: microprojectiles supposedly, after passing the cell wall, penetrate the organelle's envelope, thus, carrying the DNA inside. It is not known whether or how a chloroplast envelope would reseal after penetration. The mechanism of DNA entry after PEG-treatment is even less clear. The assumption is that PEG produces transient 'holes', in the plasma membrane through which DNA can enter into the cell (Paszkowski et al. 1984) . This would lead to deposition of plasmids into the cytosol, although it remains completely unknown how the DNA could subsequently reach the inside of the plastids. If, however, there is transfer of DNA from the cytosol into the plastids, then it is conceivable that also with particle bombardment plasmids are primarily delivered into the cytosol and enter the organelle afterwards. Particle bombardment (Boynton et al. 1988 ) is the method primarily used for the genetic transformation of plastids in algae as well as in higher plants. PEGtreatment of protoplasts (Golds et al. 1993) was successfully used in a number of higher plant species (see Table 9 ). In tobacco, plastid transformation is highly efficient irrespective of the methods used for DNA delivery. Another, but less efficient, technique is vortexing of cell-wall deficient algal cells with glass beads (Kindle et al. 1991) . A femtosyringe-based microinjection procedure was used to deliver a GFP gene into plastids (Knoblauch et al. 1999; van Bel et al. 2001) , and transient expression was clearly achieved, stable transformants were, however, not described. Earlier reports on Agrobacterium-mediated plastid transformation were never subsequently confirmed (de Block et al. 1985; Venkateswarlu and Nazar 1991) .",

Note, that gene products detected in experiments analysing transient expression might at least in part be due to transcription from sequences integrated via cointegrate formation (Klaus et al. 2004) , if vectors containing extended plastome sequences were used. Daniell et al. (1990) reported expression of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase in bombarded tobacco suspension cells, but no expression was found after electroporation of suspension cell-derived protoplasts. The expression was assigned to plastids (supposedly leucoplasts and not chloroplasts). Transient expression of GUS following particle bombardment in tobacco Daniell et al. 1991; Seki et al. 1995) or PEG-treatment of leaf protoplasts in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia (Sp\u00f6rlein et al. 1991) was also reported. In the protoplasts, the GUS protein, which was co-purified with plastids, was proteinase stable, in contrast to protein derived from a nucleo/cytosolic reporter construct. GFP served as a reporter for transient expression after particle bombardment (Hibberd et al. 1998 ) and after femtosyringe-mediated microinjection (Knoblauch et al. 1999) . Expression is quite cumbersome to detect and difficult to quantify after particle bombardment or microinjection. Thus, a versatile, reliable and easy to use system for quantitative transient expression studies is still missing.",

            "text": "The organelle's recombination system requires sequences on the transformation vector with sufficient homology to the target plastome to allow for homologous recombination. Such 'homologous flanks' are generally about 1 kbp in length. Shorter flanks would presumably reduce recombination efficiency, while significantly longer flanks cause technical problems with vector construction. Expression cassettes in plastid transformation vectors require regulatory elements, such as promoters, 5' UTRs, ribosome binding sites and 3' UTRs, which are compatible with the plastid gene expression machinery. A heterologous transcription system can also be used, consisting of a foreign RNA polymerase and an expression cassette, which is equipped with a suitable promoter (McBride et al. 1994) . Further modifications consist of a \"downstream box\" for enhanced translation efficiency (Kuroda and Maliga 2001a; Herz et al. 2005 ), fusion and/or purification tags for enhanced protein stability and facilitation of protein extraction , and protease cleavage sites, if authentic starting amino acids are required for a desired protein end product (Staub et al. 2000) . Artificial operons may contain one or more cistrons (Staub and Maliga 1995a; L\u00f6ssl et al. 2003; Arai et al. 2004; Quesada-Vargas et al. 2005; Herz et al. 2005) . A plastid transformation vector for the insertion of a dicistronic operon is depicted in Fig. 2 . A selection marker gene is certainly also required for the transformation process. If the second cistron is used for this purpose, it is safe to assume that the protein encoded by the first cistron is also transcribed in the selected lines, due to read-through transcription. Alternatively, a selection marker cassette could be positioned elsewhere on the same transformation vector or on a different transformation vector and used in a co-transformation approach, which works efficiently in plastid transformation (Carrer and Maliga 1995; Herz et al. 2005) . Up to four genes combined in a single operon were successfully introduced into the tobacco plastome (Nakashita et al. 2001; L\u00f6ssl et al. 2003; Arai et al. 2004; Quesada-Vargas et al. 2005) , and it might be possible to co-introduce and co-express even higher numbers of cistrons.",

Interestingly, the level of expression may even be higher if transcription is controlled by an endogenous rather than a separate promoter. It is also possible to use incomplete expression cassettes on cotransforming, separate transformation vectors, since complete and functional expression cassettes can be assembled from such \"split vectors\" by homologous recombination inside the plant after transformation (Herz et al. 2005) . Lutz et al. (2004) demonstrated that the integrase of phage phiC31 can be used for integrating foreign DNA into the tobacco plastome, if in a preceding transformation step suitable recognition sequences (attB) had been introduced into the target plastome. The real advantage of this approach remains to be demonstrated. Integration of attB elements relies on the endogenous recombination system -which was speculated to be rate-limiting -and the integrase has to be supplied either via another stable transformation or transiently.",

In Chlamydomonas, Kindle et al. (1994) found highly amplified plasmid copies that were capable of correcting a photosynthetic growth defect. Suzuki et al. (1997) analyzed the transformed lines further and found characteristic rearrangements in both copies of the inverted repeat. Attempts to generate plastid transformants using vectors without any homology to the recipient plastome failed. Re-transformation of the lines that contained amplified plasmid copies with standard-type vectors surprisingly led to loss of the amplified plasmids. Thus, the mechanisms leading to establishment of plasmids apparently capable of autonomously replicating in plastids are presently not understood. Interestingly, plastid transformation in Euglena gracilis (Doetsch et al. 2001 ) also involved episomal elements. In tobacco, a potentially autonomously replicating element, NICE 1, was described (Staub and Maliga 1994, 1995b) . However, as correctly stated by the authors, replication of this element could have also occurred while integrated into the plastid chromosome (see also: Klaus et al. 2004 ). Interestingly, M\u00fchlbauer et al. (2002) did not find any influence on plastid replication activity after inactivation or deletion of the NICE 1 sequences from the tobacco plastome.",

This needs to be considered when designing transformation vectors, since undesired loss of sequences might follow otherwise Zou et al. 2003) . On the other hand, direct repeat-mediated loop-out recombination can also be used for marker removal as initially shown for Chlamydomonas by Fischer et al. (1996) and later for higher plants by Iamtham and Day (2000) and Durfourmantel et al. (2006) . The marker is maintained as long as a selective pressure is present. After removal of selection, marker gene sequences are excised; however, transformants cannot be distinguished phenotypically from wild type lines. Therefore, this system benefits from the availability of a secondary selection system, e.g., herbicide resistance (Iamtham and Day 2000) . Interestingly, the same approach can be applied for targeted gene inactivation in chloroplasts (Kode et al. 2005 (Kode et al. , 2006 . In a different approach, Klaus et al. (2004) used transformation vectors with a different architecture. They positioned the selection marker cassette outside the homologous flanks, such that the marker can never become stably integrated. This approach was stimulated by their observation that recombination via a single flank occurs routinely, leading to the formation of vector co-integrates, which are later resolved through secondary recombination events. Secondary recombination within co-integrate structures automatically results either in plastomes identical to those of the acceptor lines or marker-free plastomes containing the gene of interest. Klaus et al. (2004) applied phenotypical selection using pigmentation. Alternatively, use of a secondary selection marker, PCR screening or other visible markers could also be conceived as a means to assist in detecting the regenerates containing the gene of interest. A difference in using vectors with the marker gene in the vector backbone lies in the fact that loop-out recombination can only occur after integration of vector sequences into the plastome, whereas in the process described by Fischer et al. (1996) and Iamtham and Day (2000) the marker gene might be lost even prior to the transformation event itself. Whether this might reduce transformation efficiency, is not known.",

Thus insertion of the marker, i.e., disruption of the essential gene, could not be driven to homoplasmy and segregation allowed for the recovery of lines containing the gene of interest but not the marker gene. Ye et al. (2003) used two different vectors in tobacco and a scheme, which was initially based on spectinomycin as the selective inhibitor and subsequently on an herbicide. The rational behind this scheme is that initial selection with herbicides is not possible in plastid transformation, whereas after enrichment for transplastomes, the level of herbicide tolerance might be sufficient to, in a heteroplasmic situation, allow for segregation of lines, which carry the herbicide but not the antibiotic resistance genes. Indeed, 20% of the recovered lines fulfilled this criterion.",

CRE recombinase, derived from the P1 bacteriophage, mediates insertion or excision of sequences, provided that recognition elements, loxP sites, are present on the recombination substrate molecules. Marker gene removal, thus, requires directly repeated loxP elements flanking the marker gene in the plastome. CRE recombinase can be expressed from a nuclear expression cassette, translated in the cytosol and then introduced into the plastid through the organelle's import machinery. When executing this approach, additional plastome rearrangements were found that were not necessarily only due to 'cryptic' lox sites in the plastome (Corneille et al. 2003 ) but were either based on short direct repeats or on recombination 'hot spots'. CRE recombinase seems to generally increase recombination activity in the plastome. Introduction of the recombinase into the transplastomic lines can either be established by Agrobacterium-mediated stable or transient (Lutz et al. 2006a (Lutz et al. , 2006b nuclear transformation or by crossing a transplastomic line with a suitable nuclear transformant. Marker removal through Agroinfiltration-based transient expression (Lutz et al. 2006a (Lutz et al. , 2006b ) is efficient and clearly preferable since removal of stably integrated expression cassettes from the nuclear genome is not necessary. In addition, plastome rearrangements no longer occur once the CRE recombinase is absent.",

(1988) immediately opened the door for the systematic inactivation of chloroplast genes of unknown function. The first targeted gene disruption affected PsaC, a subunit of PS I, which was shown to be essential for PS I activity (Takahashi et al. 1991) . At the same time and as mentioned above (3.2), the chloroplast tscA locus was mapped by biolistic complementation of the mutant strain H13 and shown to encode a small RNA which is required for the trans-splicing process generating mature psaA mRNA and, thus, active PS I (Goldschmidt-Clermont et al. 1991) . In the meantime, 36 genes of the C. reinhardtii genome have been inactivated, which are listed in Table 3 , representing an updated version of the one published by Grossman et al. (2003) . Only six genes turned out to be essential, i.e., could not be brought to homoplasmy. These include three genes for subunits of the chloroplast-encoded RNA polymerase, a ribosomal protein gene, the clpP heteroplasmic Boudreau et al. 1997b gene and ORF1995. Recently a procedure was described which allows the analysis of the function of such essential genes by reducing the gene product levels. This strategy, named translational attenuation, is based on the finding that reduced Su et al. 2005 protein synthesis rates which are obtained after alteration of the AUG start codon can already cause severe phenotypes (Chen et al. 1993) . Correspondingly, after mutation of the clpP initiation codon to AUU the degradation of the cytochrome b 6 f complex was affected suggesting that ClpP is involved in quality control of this photosynthetic complex (Majeran et al. 2000) . Most inactivated genes encode photosynthetic functions and, thus, are not essential for cell viability on acetatecontaining medium (Table 3) .",

Antigenicity was demonstrated suggesting that transplastomic C. reinhardtii cells might be a source for mucosal vaccines (Sun et al. 2003) . In addition, a fully active human antibody directed against glycoprotein D of the herpes simplex virus was expressed in the alga (Mayfield et al. 2003) verifying that pharmaceutical proteins can be synthesized in C. reinhardtii chloroplasts.

However, despite the presence of suitably-sized homologous flanking chloroplast DNA sequences, the transforming DNA was not stably integrated into the chloroplast genome but, instead, was inherited as an episomal element during continuous selection on antibiotics (Doetsch et al. 2001 ). Further work is required to elucidate the potential of this transformation system, which represents the first one for an alga containing complex chloroplasts, a feature that developed during secondary endosymbiosis (Delwiche 1999) .

Single crossover events have been observed after homologous recombination-mediated integration of a mutant AHAS gene conferring resistance to the herbicide SMM (see 3.2) into the chloroplast genome. However, homoplasmy was not reached under the applied experimental conditions leaving the question open whether transformants can be maintained under non-selective conditions. Interestingly, transformation rates were shown to significantly increase after synchronization of cell cultures in light/dark regimes and particle bombardment immediately after the dark phase (Lapidot et al. 2002) . This procedure might be valuable also for other algal species, which have so far not been accessible to chloroplast transformation.",

The light-regulated psbA control elements (promoter, 5'-UTR and 3'-UTR) are also frequently used Fernandez-San Millan et al. 2003) . These control elements have been shown to generally generate superior expression levels. Very high expression levels could also be obtained with the T7-system (promoter and 5'-UTR) relying on nuclear expressed and plastid imported T7-polymerase (McBride et al. 1994) or with operon extension vectors under the control of strong endogenous promoters (Staub and Maliga 1995a; Herz et al. 2005) .

Therefore, inducible expression in plastids cannot be achieved using endogenous plastid control elements. External control was first described using a plastid transgene under control of the phage T7 promoter in combination with T7 polymerase encoded by a nuclear transgene and imported into the organelle (McBride et al. 1994) . Controlled expression is achieved to a certain extent (Magee et al. 2004a) , and negative effects observed during constitutive expression of genes of interest (L\u00f6ssl et al. 2003) were avoided, when the same genes were transcribed by an ethanol induced T7 polymerase (L\u00f6ssl et al. 2005) . The system is, however, not optimal. The T7 promoter is recognized in in vitro experiments by the nucleus encoded plastid RNA polymerase (Lerbs-Mache 1993) . This would, if true also in vivo, lead to background expression in the non-induced state. Furthermore, expression of some plastid genes is altered in the presence of T7 polymerase even if the genes do not contain a T7 promoter (Magee and Kavanagh 2002) , and the low level of expression typical for most nuclear inducible promoters in the absence of an inducer may be sufficient to cause an undesirable phenotype (Magee et al. 2004a (Magee et al. , 2007 . Buhot et al. (2006) reported using the eubacterial E. coli groE heat shock promoter, which is not recognized by the plastid transcription machineries. Controlled expression was achieved through transient expression from a nuclear expression cassette of a chimeric sigma factor that mediates the interaction of the plastid encoded plastid RNA polymerase (PEP) and the eubacterial promoter. It remains to be seen how the system performs if combined with an inducible nuclear promoter.",

Thus, a gene of interest lacking an own start codon is brought into contact with the non-excised start codon of the excised marker gene. The advantage of the system lies in the fact that it is not sensitive to read-through transcription. Control is executed by generating a translatable open reading frame and GFP was used as the reporter protein. Prior to excision there is no detectable GFP, while accumulation of GFP is found to constitute up to 0.3% of the total cellular protein after excision. Again, a transgene expressed from the nucleus is required to trigger plastid expression: primary transplastomic lines harbouring an inactive gene of interest were transformed in a second step in their nuclear genome using Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer. Once the activation has occurred it cannot be reversed, and it remains to be seen, how the approach can be adapted for practical purposes. A direct induction system, which is independent of nuclear gene expression, is based on constitutive repression of a plastid transgene by the lac repressor and induction with isopropyl-\u00df-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) . Increase of the level of reporter protein (GFP) was about 20-fold. This system is also not optimal, since there is low-level expression in the non-induced state. It is, however, attractive, since post-harvest induction is possible , avoiding spraying of IPTG in the open field, which might be ecologically undesirable.",

With one exception all the direct selection markers provide resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotics spectinomycin, streptomycin, and kanamycin. These compounds inhibit protein synthesis by specifically binding to the organelle's prokaryotic 70S ribosomes. Pioneering work with tobacco transformation was achieved using plastid marker genes isolated from plants that were resistant to streptomycin and spectinomycin (Svab et al. 1990; Staub and Maliga 1992) . Two specific point mutations in the rrn16 gene (Spc + and Str + ) and one mutation in the rps12 gene (Str + ) alter ribosome structure and prevent antibiotic binding. Similar gene sequences, cloned from the Solanum nigrum plastome, have been successfully used for transformation of tobacco (Kavanagh et al. 1999 ) and more recently tomato ). However, much higher efficiencies of transformation have been reported using dominant chimeric antibiotic resistance genes. The most universally used marker is the aadA gene, which detoxifies spectinomycin and streptomycin (Goldschmidt-Clermont 1991; Svab and Maliga 1993) . Translational fusions between aadA and gfp (FLARE-S) have also been used to generate bifunctional proteins that can be used for visual tracking of the transformation process (Khan and Maliga 1999) . Marker genes giving resistance to kanamycin, nptII and aphA-6 (Huang et al. 2002) have also been described. A novel approach for cotton plastid transformation involved the simultaneous use of nptII and aphA-6 to detoxify kanamycin. The double gene/single selection strategy was shown to be more efficient than using the aphA-6 gene alone (Kumar et al. 2004b) .",

            "text": "Higher plant plastid transformation necessitates the development of selection systems to meet highly demanding criteria. Selective advantage must be generated on two levels, that of the plastid and that of the individual cell. A typical tobacco mesophyll cell contains as many as 100 plastids each with up to 100 plastome copies (see Table 2 for an overview of plastid biology). Although the precise mechanism of plastid transformation is unknown, it can be speculated that it is a rare event, perhaps initially only occurring as one transformed molecule within a single plastid. Appropriate selection conditions must be chosen to amplify the transformed molecules such that they become the dominant plastome type. The removal of all wild type plastomes can prove difficult and sometimes very time consuming. Conventionally this has been performed by making cycles of repeated regeneration from leaf explants on selection medium, such that cell division and organelle segregation ultimately lead to stable homoplasmic tissues . Dix and Kavanagh (1995) have described the possible benefit of using plastid genes carrying point mutations to speed up the process of selecting for homoplasmic transformants. Recessive-type markers as opposed to dominant selectable markers such as aadA do not cause localized detoxification of the selection agent, which could conceivably maintain heteroplastomy. However, much lower transformation frequencies are generally obtained using genes carrying point mutations compared to the dominant selection markers. A novel selection system was described by Klaus et al. (2003) to improve selection of transformants and also accelerate segregation towards homoplasmy. Firstly, homoplastomic pigmentdeficient mutants were produced following site-specific deletion of photosynthesis-related genes using the aadA gene and spectinomycin selection (see section 4.4). These acceptor lines were propagated in vitro and used as an alternative to wild type plants for re-transformation using reconstitution vectors carrying aphA-6 together with foreign sequences of interest. Transformants recovered after kanamycin selection had a wild type appearance due to complementation of the previously deleted plastome sequences and these regenerants could clearly be distinguished from untransfomed tissues. Surprisingly, PCR showed that the primary regenerants were already homoplasmic, suggesting that green tissues have a strong selective advantage over pigment deficient ones.",

The absence of a glycosylation system and the prokaryotic nature of the plastid expression system make the plastid compartment an unsuitable system for some proteins, whereas many others have been successfully expressed.

Given the differences in methods of quantification, the reported levels of expression need to be interpreted with some care. Most of the reported expression levels are maximum values, which were obtained under optimal conditions. Stable proteins such as GUS accumulate in planta such that the highest levels are found in mature plants (Herz et al. 2005) , whereas proteins more susceptible to degradation like interferon or VP6 (Birch-Machin et al. 2004 ) occur at higher levels in young leaves. Depending on the regulatory elements, light conditions also influence the expression level (Fernandez-San Millan et al. 2003; Watson et al. 2004; Herz et al. 2005; Wirth et al. 2006) . In general, the expression level in plastids is higher than with conventional nuclear expression in plants, but lower than the levels obtained with recent transient expression technology (Gleba et al. 2005 ). However, it should be clear that no expression system is universally suitable for every protein. The characteristics of the protein of interest have to fit with the chosen expression system. Unfortunately, this cannot be predicted in advance, and needs to be tested experimentally. As such there are also examples for proteins, which could not be expressed in plastids like haemoglobin (Magee et al. 2004b ), \u00df-zein (Bellucci et al. 2005) , or haemagglutinin (Lelivelt et al. 2005) .",

High transcript levels do, however, not necessarily result in high levels of translated protein (Magee et al. 2004a (Magee et al. , 2004b . There is growing evidence that correct folding and proteolytic stability of the target protein are more important determinants of the expression level than transcription and translation efficiency (Birch-Machin et al. 2004) . When GUS was fused to the N-terminus of interferon\u03b3 the expression level increased from 0.1 to 6% and the half-life of the fusion protein increased from 6 to 48 hours compared to the unmodified interferon-\u03b3 although both versions were under the control of identical regulatory elements .

            "text": "Unlike in many other expression systems, codon usage plays only a minor role in the plastid expression system of N. tabacum, probably because of the relatively balanced codon frequency (Maliga 2003) . Nevertheless, heterologous gene expression was modestly increased (up to 2.5-fold), if the codon usage was adjusted to the relatively AT-rich plastid genome of tobacco (Ye et al. 2001; Tregoning et al. 2003) . On the other hand, at least in vitro translation efficiencies do not always correlate with codon usage (Nakamura and Sugiura 2007) . Although mRNA editing occurs in resident plastome genes, no editing of heterologous genes has ever been observed. Staub and co-workers (2000) established an elegant expression system for mature somatotropin in plastids by fusing the mature somatotropin domain to an ubiquitin domain, which is only processed to mature protein by endogenous cytosolic ubiquitin-protease during the extraction procedure but not in the intact plastid. However, one additional amino acid was removed from the N-terminus in most of the processed somatotropin. This could arise from incorrect processing by cytosolic ubiquitin-protease or from a secondary protease activity. In fact, most endogenous proteins expressed in plastids are processed post-translationally by methionine-aminopeptidase and/or peptide-deformylase (Giglione and Meinnel 2001) . In the case of the RUBISCO large subunit even two N-terminal amino acids are removed post-translationally (Houtz et al. 1989) . Currently, little is known about post-translational modifications of recombinant proteins in plastids. Analysis of recombinant hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) in plastids showed that the starting methionine was cleaved off, but no further modifications were detected (Dufourmantel et al. 2007 ). However, when tetanus toxin (TetC) was expressed in tobacco plastids the initiator methionine was not removed posttranslationally, but around half of the TetC was expressed as a slightly larger, modified protein (Tregoning et al. 2003) . Comparative analysis of mature aminoterminal sequences of twelve recombinant proteins expressed in chloroplasts suggests that recombinant proteins comply with the N-terminal processing rules proposed for endogenous plastid proteins (Fernandez-San Millan et al. 2007) .",

The main fraction of the protein was lipidated but unlipidated protein and lipoprotein variants were also present. Another important aspect is the correct formation of disulfide bonds, which can be achieved in the cytosol of prokaryotic hosts like E. coli only in specially modified strains (Bessette et al. 1999) . It was shown that all disulfide bonds of somatotropin where formed correctly inside plastids (Staub et al. 2000) , making it a suitable host for disulfide-containing proteins.",

However, expression in chloroplasts seems to be much higher compared to other plastid types, such as amyloplasts or chromoplasts. Expression of an AAD-GFP fusion protein (FLARE-S) was detected in non-green tissues including petals and roots of transplastomic tobacco (Khan and Maliga 1999). However, the expression level of GFP in potato tubers was only 0.05% TSP compared to 5% TSP in green tissues (Sidorov et al. 1999) . Kumar et al. (2004a) , on the other hand, report only a minor decrease of BADH-expression in carrot roots compared to carrot leaves. In transplastomic tomato fruits the expression level of the aadA selection marker un-der control of the constitutive 16S-promoter was half as high as in the green leaves (Ruf et al. 2001) . High expression of recombinant HPPD under control of the light-regulated psbA promoter and 5'-UTR was reported in transplastomic tobacco leaves, but also at a lower level in seeds and petals, whereas no expression was detectable in roots (Dufourmantel et al. 2007 ). In soybean expression of Bt-toxin was detected in leaves, stems and seeds but not in root tissue (Dufourmantel et al. 2005) .",

But in the case of EPSPS (5-enolpyrovylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) expression, transplastomic lines showed no higher resistance to the herbicide glyphosate than nuclear transformants, despite much lower expression levels of EPSPS in the nuclear transformants (Ye et al. 2001 ). The reason for the different resistance levels might be the alternative mode of action of glyphosate (inhibitor of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis) and isoxaflutole (inhibitor of tocopherol-and plastoquinonebiosynthesis). Glyphosate is toxic for all cell types whereas isoxaflutole is only toxic to photosynthetic cells. Thus, plastid expression of HPPD is particularly well suited since only expression in the chloroplast is needed whereas plastid expression of recombinant proteins in non-green tissues is generally much lower, limiting the efficiency of EPSPS in these cells (Dufourmantel et al. 2007 ). Plastidic expression of PAT (phosphinothricin acetyltransferase) resulted in high tolerance to the herbicide phosphinothricin, an inhibitor of glutamine biosynthesis Kang et al. 2003b) .",

It has often been proposed to use plant-made vaccines directly as edible vaccines, taking advantage of cheap production cost and easy application (Tregoning et al. 2004; Daniell et al. 2005a; Daniell 2006) . However, edible vaccines would have to face the high standards of pharmaceutical production and potential risk of amalgamation with food plants (Fox 2006) . It is, therefore, more likely that for human vaccines, the proteins would be extracted, purified and for-mulated as with existing production procedures. Nevertheless with an increasing world population the need for cheap vaccine production also increases, making plastid expression systems an attractive alternative.",

However, despite numerous additional publications describing improvements in the efficiency of tobacco transformation the transfer of the technology to other plants has proven relatively difficult. Table 9 summarizes the current status of higher plant plastid transformation. It should be stressed that in addition to tobacco, fertile homoplasmic plants have only been described for N. plumbaginifolia, tomato, soybean, Lesquerella, cotton, petunia, and lettuce. Furthermore, with four exceptions (potato, tomato, soybean, and lettuce) the remaining species are all documented as single publications only. As such there is no great depth of knowledge in the field regarding reproducibility and potential for improvement. The favoured method for transformation has been particle bombardment using explants as target tissue (e.g. leaves, callus, or suspension cells). Various efficiencies have been observed using this approach, as many as 40 leaf bombardments were needed to obtain a single plastid transformant from Arabidopsis (Sikdar et al. 1998) , whereas in soybean (Dufourmantel et al. 2004 ) and, recently, in tomato (Wurbs et al. 2007 ) one transformant per shot or better have been described.",

However, it is readily apparent that even the best efficiencies reported are generally much lower than those typically obtained in tobacco, where bombardment can yield one to fourteen transformants per shot with leaves Daniell et al. 2001c ), four or more events per plate of bombarded cell suspension cells (Langbecker et al. 2004) , and three to 47 transformants can be obtained for every million protoplasts treated with PEG (Koop et al. 1996) . There are several reasons given in the literature for the lower transformation efficiencies observed in non-tobacco species, including, reduced activity of plastid homologous recombination (Sikdar et al. 1998 ), a focus on green tissues containing fully developed chloroplasts (Bogorad 2000) , and use of heterologous elements for vector construction (Skarjinskaia et al. 2003) . While the influence of these factors cannot be excluded there is no collective evidence that any are limiting progress in the field.
