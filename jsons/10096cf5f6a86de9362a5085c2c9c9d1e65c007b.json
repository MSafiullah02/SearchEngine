In Almaty, a city-scale quarantine came into force on March 19, 2020, which was a week after the first COVID-19 case was registered in Kazakhstan. This study aims to analyze the effect of the lockdown from March 19 to April 14, 2020 (27 days), on the concentrations of air pollutants in Almaty. Daily concentrations of PM 2.5 , NO 2 , SO 2 , CO, O 3 , and BTEX were compared between the periods before and during the lockdown. During the lockdown, the PM 2.5 concentration was reduced by 21% with spatial variations of 6-34% compared to the average on the same days in 2018-2019, and still, it exceeded WHO daily limit values for 18 days. There were also substantial reductions in CO and NO 2 concentrations by 49% Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 and 35%, respectively, but an increase in O 3 levels by 15% compared to the prior 17 days before the lockdown. The concentrations of benzene and toluene were 2-3 times higher than those during in the same seasons of 2015-2019. The temporal reductions may not be directly attributed to the lockdown due to favorable meteorological variations during the period, but the spatial effects of the quarantine on the pollution levels are evidenced. The results demonstrate the impact of traffic on the complex nature of air pollution in Almaty, which is substantially contributed by various nontraffic related sources, mainly coal-fired combined heat and power plants and household heating systems, as well as possible small irregular sources such as garbage burning and bathhouses.",

The spatial reductions varied between 6% and 34% during the lockdown period compared to the other years (Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. S2 , Supplementary File), and this might be attributed to the removal of traffic emissions with their varying contributions to the spatial locations. Almaty is located at an altitude between 600 m and 1300 m due to its proximity to the mountains. A previous study by (Kerimray et al., 2020) depicted that the PM 2.5 concentration was correlated with the elevations of the monitoring stations (R 2 =0.64). In this study, PM 2.5 concentration levels during the 2020 lockdown did not have a correlation with the elevation (R 2 =0.23), distance to CHP-2 (R 2 =0.1), or distance to CHP-3 (R 2 =0.22) (Fig. S2, Supplementary File). A previous study by (Kerimray et al., 2020) used data from 11 monitoring stations for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 9 PM 2.5 , while in this study, data from only 7 stations was used (due to the absence of full datasets for March months in 2018-2020). However, the spatial model results shown in Fig. 3 show that the spatial profiles have similarities-lower levels in the south and higher levels in the northbut their variation ranges are significantly different. The weak correlations with distance to CHP-2 (R 2 =0.10) and CHP-3 (R 2 =0.22) could be due to many contributing factors, including the long distance of the sampling sites from CHP-2, several contributing sources of emissions located at different places, complicated topography, and varying wind directions.",

Station 16 is at the lowest elevation above sea level (647 m) compared to the locations of the other stations. This station is located at the border of Almaty and administratively belongs to the Almaty region; however, it was included in this study. Station 16 is only 2.5 km away from the coal-fired CHP-3 and is located near major roads. The impacts of traffic and CHP-3 emissions are evident at this location (Kerimray et al., 2020) . The high levels despite the absence of the traffic contribution (38 \u03bcg m -3 ) demonstrate that coal combustion (especially close location to CHP-3) is the primary source impacting the station.

The correlation of the benzene and toluene concentrations with the distance from CHP-3 was stronger than the correlation with the elevation (Fig. 5) , and this may indicate the dominant contribution of CHP-3 to BTEX pollution in the city. According to the environmental reports of CHP-3 in 2015, coal consumption at CHP-3 was expected to increase in the future due to the rising demand for electricity (Department of Ecology of Almaty region, 2015). There were substantial increases in benzene and toluene during the lockdown period compared to the average during the 2015-2019 years, while some reductions were observed in ethylbenzene and o-xylene concentrations.

In 2015, the obtained T/B ratios were <1 in 18 out of 36 measurements, indicating that sources of BTEX were both vehicle exhaust and coal combustion (Baimatova et al., 2016) . The T/B found in most of the analyzed samples in 2016 (30 from 36 measurements) and 2018 (31 from 35 measurements) were \u22651, suggesting that BTEX mainly originated from transport-related sources. The T/B of the vast majority of collected samples in 2017 (33 from 36 measurements) and 2019 (23 from 35 measurements) were <1, which indicated that BTEX mainly originated from coal burning (Ibragimova et al., 2019) .

Thus, the effect of the lockdown, which started on March 19, 2020, on the average concentration change is not evident if such a decline in PM 2.5 happens annually as a result of temperature change, and this decline was the same as in the previous years without a lockdown (2018 and 2019). Thus, the reduction of the PM 2.5 concentration during the lockdown period of March 19 -April 14, 2020, compared to that during the preceding period of February 21 -March 18, 2020, can be possibly attributed to the more frequent rains, increasing temperatures, lower frequency of temperature inversions, increasing wind speeds and changes in its direction. The sharp reductions of the PM 2.5 concentration onMarch 22, April 2, April 9, and April 14 (2020) can be associated with rains on those days(Fig. 1).",
