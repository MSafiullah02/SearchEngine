            "text": "More than 2\u00b77 million individuals worldwide have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and 187 000 have died from the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as of April 25, 2020. 1 Despite the common use of immunosuppressive medications, it appears that patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a similar risk for COVID-19 to the general population. 2 The management of IBD during and after the pandemic is challenging. The main concerns from a clinician's perspective are the risk for COVID-19 in patients with IBD (especially in those taking immunosuppressive medications or with malnutrition), timely follow-up and monitoring of disease, choice of and change in medical and surgical therapy, feasibility and availability of endoscopic assessment, and protection of healthcare providers against SARS-CoV-2 infection. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Additional concerns have been raised from the patients' perspective, including medical, psychosocial, and financial factors. Therefore, we did a survey involving patients with IBD to analyse their feedback on their care during the early and late phases of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The anonymous questionnaire was designed by clinicians, registered nurses, and patient representatives and was posted on the China Crohn's and Colitis Foundation's patient portal.",

Measures to curtail the virus, such as shelter-in-place, government mandates for postponing elective procedures, restriction of transportation, and the reassignment of gastroenterologists or IBD health-care providers, can interfere with routine or emergent care. Most patients with IBD experienced stable disease during the early and current phases of the outbreak and those individuals did not have to change their medications. Our survey data suggest that the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on medical management of IBD was largely related to logistics. Restructuring IBD care, such as personnel reassignment, infusion service availability, drug delivery, and telemedicine, have been proposed as being important for IBD management during such a pandemic. 8 Our survey shows that a quarter of patients sought care via telemedicine with their IBD physicians. There was also increased use of online delivery of oral medications.",

Our survey suggests that although patients' moods were affected by concerns about psychosocial and economic issues, their disease course was not affected. Respondents were concerned about the risk of infection and worried about access to health care. More than 50% of respondents had mood changes and their mood changes appeared to improve as the pandemic trend was flattening. More than 80% of employed respondents had to work from home and 40% of the respondents reported a reduced income. The financial impact can be long lasting, which could affect the affordability of and adherence to medical care. This could eventually alter disease outcomes.",
