With huge number of asymptomatic potential virus carriers, the initial policy of home isolation was not sufficiently effective and was complicated by growing fear and helplessness.

Large public venues like stadiums and college/school dorms were converted into preliminary medical facilities to admit suspected carriers and verified patients who remained asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic. The facilities were named Fang Cang hospital, a name derived from the concept of military container shelter. The goal was to admit at earliest time all those who should be isolated or monitored. Within a matter of days, 16 such facilities were functioning at capacity with 13,000 admissions in Wuhan alone. The facilities are staffed with medical professionals who can identify clinical deterioration at the earliest stage and immediately initiate necessary responses including transferring to higher-level hospitals designated for treating COVID-19. Supplies are provided by the government agents and daily activities of the in-patients are organized to minimize psychological stress. Establishment of Fang Cang hospital is the crucial measure that has begun to curb the rapidly uprising trend in the curve of accumulated cases.",
