This pertains to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on chromosome 19q13.2 which affects the gene for 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase C. This SNP has been linked to increased susceptibility to KD. A direct clinical correlate has been the use of calcineurin inhibitors in patients with refractory KD. The pathway associated with transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) signaling has been linked to increased risk of coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs). A direct clinical correlate of this has been the initiation of clinical trials for use of atorvastatin in KD. The third pathway relates to a SNP in the FCGR2A that has been identified in KD patients of European descent and appears to influence susceptibility to this disease.26\n",

The acute stage of KD lasts approximately 2\u20133 weeks and is characterized by edema of endothelial and smooth muscle cells with an inflammatory cell infiltrate, which is initially polymorphonuclear and later replaced by macrophages, lymphocytes (primarily CD8+ T cells) and plasma cells. The inflammatory process affects all three layers of the vascular wall, with destruction of internal as well as external elastic lamina. When the weakened arterial wall can no longer withstand its internal pressure, it becomes dilated and deformed, thereby leading on to aneurysm formation. Thrombi may develop in the vascular lumen further obstructing the blood flow. Over time, healing occurs in the vessel wall and this results in fibrosis and marked intimal proliferation which may manifest on imaging as stenotic lesions.",

Myocarditis is also common in this phase. Pericarditis, hydrops of the gallbladder and perineal desquamation are other early features of KD. There may be redness and crusting at the BCG inoculation site (more common in infants).\nSubacute phase (2\u20134 weeks): Most of the acute symptoms subside by this time. Periungual desquamation is typically seen in this phase. In some children arthritis of one or several joints can develop. CAAs are most commonly seen during this phase.\nConvalescent phase: By this time, all clinical signs have generally disappeared. This phase lasts for approximately 6 weeks. By the end of this phase, the acute phase reactants (especially the CRP and the elevated platelet counts) settle down.

            "text": "KD remains a clinical diagnosis and no laboratory investigation is pathognomonic. However, several laboratory parameters may support the clinical diagnosis.\nHematological: Leukocytosis, shift of differential leukocyte count towards left and toxic granulation of neutrophils are particularly seen during first week of illness. Rarely neutropenia can occur.1 The platelet count is usually normal in the first week of illness. Thrombocytopenia, which may appear during early phase of the disease, is a significant risk factor for development of coronary artery aneurysm. Presence of thrombocytopenia in KD indicates development of disseminated intravascular coagulation or macrophage activation syndrome.28, 35 Thrombocytosis, which is characteristic of the disease, usually appears in the second week, and peaks in the third week. In uncomplicated cases platelet count gradually normalizes by 4\u20138 weeks. The mean peak platelet count is 7,00,000/mm3 but, it may be as high as (even more than) 1 million/mm3. Anemia, which is normocytic and normochromic, can be detected in 50% of patients within the first 2 weeks of illness. It is more common with prolonged active inflammation and a significant predictor of development of CAAs.28, 36\n\nUrine examination: Sterile pyuria, usually of urethral origin can be found in 33% of patients with KD.13\n\nBiochemical abnormalities: Up to 40% of patients with KD can have mild elevations of transaminases and in 10% there can be hyperbilirubinemia.28 Hypoalbuminemia is more common and its presence indicates a severe form of disease. Several alterations in the serum lipid profile have been described in children with KD, and some of these may persist for several months after the acute episode.28\n\nCerebrospinal fluid examination (CSF): CSF examination is not mandatory for the diagnosis of KD. In 50% of patients it demonstrates mononuclear cell predominance with normal glucose and protein levels (aseptic meningitis).28\n\nImaging studies.\nEchocardiography: Two dimensional echocardiography remains the gold standard for detection of CAAs in KD. During the acute stage the coronary arteries appear \u2018bright\u2019 on echocardiography. CAAs include aneurysms, ectasia and stenoses. For accurate assessment of CAAs, Z scores need to be calculated. However, echocardiography has some significant limitations. It is highly operator dependent and there is no gainsaying the fact that inaccuracies may creep in if the operator is not appropriately trained. Further, performing echocardiography on a sick and irritable child requires skill and patience. Echocardiography can only delineate the proximal sections of coronary arteries, and the circumflex artery may be very difficult to view.\nDual source CT coronary angiography: This is a recent advancement in the accurate detection of CAAs in patients with KD with minimal radiation risk. The important advantage over echocardiography is its ability to detect proximal as well as distal arterial abnormalities. With modern technologies available with such machines the radiation dose can be reduced to minimal levels (<1 mSv).37 At our center, we have started carrying out this investigation in cases wherein echocardiographic findings are equivocal. We have also used this modality for follow-up of patients with large CAAs detected on echocardiography.\n",
