As our health-care system faces this outbreak, the most pressing issues facing neurosurgeons involve (1) the decision to cancel elective cases and outpatient clinics, (2) organizing staff (including advanced practitioners and resident physicians) to minimize exposure risk, and (3) handling neurosurgical emergencies in situations where intensive care unit (ICU) bed availability is compromised by an increasing number of COVID-19 patients.",

Only articles in the English language were considered for this literature review. Once all relevant articles were identified, we extracted epidemiological information regarding the scheduling of surgical cases14 and the need for ICU care.15-17 We then used these data to form a multi-disciplinary panel from our institution in the departments of surgery, anesthesia and peri-operative care, critical care, hospital administration, and neurosurgery (\u201cevidence review panel\u201d (ERP)). In addition to this literature review, we sought the advice and expertise from neurosurgeons who had direct experience in China caring for neurosurgical patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. These neurosurgeons provided first-hand knowledge of how neurosurgical cases were scheduled during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. We included these recommendations as discussion points in our ERP. Because no patient data were used for this report, Institutional Review Board approval and patient consent was not sought or obtained. The Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence checklist was used when preparing the treatment algorithm.",

The green, yellow, and red levels represent the lowest, moderate, and highest levels of surge, respectively. The black level corresponds to the need for significant resources outside of our institution. As Figure 1 indicates, in the green level, all elective cases proceed as scheduled. In the yellow level, the OR schedule is capped for 3 wk to 75% of capacity, yielding a 25% reduction in all elective and procedural cases. During this time, all outpatient procedures should be designated to an off-site hospital where COVID-19 patients are not expected to be admitted. In addition, there is a hard cap on the number of cases requiring post-operative admission. In the red level, these numbers are more strict. Namely, there is a 50% reduction in all elective case scheduling, and a 12 patient limit on postoperative admissions for all surgical cases (including non-neurosurgical cases).

Indeed, although it may be straight forward for neurosurgeons to predict what cases should be classified as an emergency, it will reduce ambiguity if the entire team is also aware of such cases. To that end, we developed a checklist that can be applied to neurosurgical case during the COVID-19 pandemic (Figure 3). Previous work has shown that checklists help organize surgical staff during times of crisis, such as guiding action during \u201cred alerts\u201d from neuromonitoring during spinal surgery.21 Here, we adapt the checklist strategy to organize surgical staff around the common goal of booking cases during the outbreak (Figure 3). Distribution of the checklist to all surgical staff will facilitate effective communication and the ease with which appropriate neurosurgical cases can be scheduled.",

As of March 18th, the UCSF Office of Research will institute a shutdown of all noncritical research activities. Understanding that the needs of long-term viability of many research programs will require management of essential animal lines, equipment, liquid nitrogen stocks, and certain long-term experiments, they are permitting 1 to 2 designated key personnel who will be responsible for this essential maintenance. Larger laboratories are allowed to name up to 3 to 4 key personnel. It is advised to select key personnel whose commute does not depend on public transportation. In mouse facilities, breeding is to be reduced to a minimum. There will be no increases in cage counts permitted. For other facilities housing aquatic, avian, or United States Department of Agriculture-covered animals, basic animal care and husbandry operations are to continue.

Furthermore, although several studies address the general strategies to cope with the strain that COVID-19 may place on the hospital system,6,15,17 specific recommendations for surgical practice are sparse. And, while the ACS lays out general principles,20 a detailed COVID-19 surgical treatment algorithm has not been previously published. Thus, our tiered volume limiting approach to restricting OR access based on the current surge level of the virus is novel. This volume limiting approach allows for dynamic resource allocation. By contrast, an alternative model would be to rank every type of surgical case ahead of time, and then triage cases based on these rankings. However, the volume limiting approach is more fluid, and allows surgeons to triage on a case-by-case basis, permitting more flexible operative plans based on the surge level, OR availability, and need for emergent cases. Thus, although neurosurgeons may feel pressure to cancel cases due to fear of intra- and perioperative COVID-19 transmission, these algorithms and checklists identify objective criteria for doing so.",
