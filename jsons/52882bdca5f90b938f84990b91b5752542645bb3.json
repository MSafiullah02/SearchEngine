Non-covalent, reversible capturing can be achieved by employing genetically engineered fusion tags (for example, GST (Glutathion S-Transferase), FLAG (DYKDDDDK peptide) or Strep-tag (WSHPQFEK peptide)) once an appropriate binding reagent (antibody), specifically targeted against the fusion tag, has been attached to a sensor chip. Biotinylated molecules can also be captured site-directed on a streptavidin surface with high affinity; however, because of their high affinity, a complete regeneration applying rather mild conditions may be problematic. For reversible capturing of GST-tagged fusion proteins, a commercially available anti-GST antibody (GST capture kit, BR-1002-23, Biacore) is commonly used (Zimmermann et al. 2008) . Thus, the interaction pattern and/or the functionality of the fused protein can be influenced by the high molecular weight of the GST-fusion tag (~26 kDa).
