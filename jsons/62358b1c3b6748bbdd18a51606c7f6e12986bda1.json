            "text": "Intervirology 2008;51:342-351 343 Coronavirus polyprotein pp1ab is a large polypeptide. The C-terminal part of the pp1ab shares relatively high conservation among coronaviruses. Polyprotein pp1ab is processed into more than 15-16 non-structural proteins (nsps) by polyprotein-encoded 3-cystine-like proteinase (3CLpro) and papain-like proteinase (PLP). These nsps form replication complexes where coronavirus genome replication and transcription take place. Bioinformatics analysis predicted the existence of another six enzymes, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), NTPase/helicase, exoribonuclease (ExoN), endoribonuclease (endoRNAse), 2 -O -methyltransferase (2 -O -MT) and ADP-ribose-1 -phosphatase diesterase [8] . Among these enzymes, endoribonuclease has gained much attention since the discovery that the endoribonuclease activity of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) nsp15 is similar to that of Xenopus XendoU [9] , which requires manganese as a cofactor to cleave uridylate-containing ssRNA [10, 11] . Due to the sequence conservation of SARS nsp15 within the order Nidovirales , U-specific Nidovirales endoribonuclease (NendoU) was engineered to refer to Nidovirales endoU to indicate its relation with XendoU [11] . The activity of recombinant NendoU has been identified for human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) nsp15 [11] , mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 nsp15 [12] , and equine arteritis virus (EAV) nsp11 [13] . Unlike XendoU, which is a monomer that cleaves ssRNA, NendoU functions as a hexamer that cleaves both ss-and double-stranded (ds)-RNA [12, [14] [15] [16] . Reverse genetics with point mutation revealed that NendoU might be involved in genome replication and sgRNA transcription, but its exact role requires further investigation [11, 13] .",

The underlined sequences are restriction sites used for cloning the gene into the expression vector pTriEX1.1 (Novagen, Gibbstown, N.J., USA) to construct plasmid pTrinsp15 for the production of C-terminal His-tagged fusion protein. The PCR reaction consisted of 1 ! PCR buffer (Promega, Madison, Wisc., USA), 200 M each of dNTPs, 200 n M of nsp15F and nsp15R, 2 l of cDNA, and 2.5 of Taq polymerase in a final volume of 50 l. PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94\u00b0 for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 93\u00b0 for 10 s, annealing at 55\u00b0 for 30 s, and extension at 72\u00b0 for 1 min. A final extension at 72\u00b0 for 10 min was included before the completion of the reaction. The PCR product was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified by Zymo DNA Clean & Concentrator-5 (Zymo Research, Orange, Calif., USA). Purified PCR product was digested with Nco I and Kpn I overnight and purified again. 2 l of purified digestion products were cloned into pTriEX1.1, which was treated in the same way as for the nsp15 PCR product. The ligation reaction was carried out at 16\u00b0 overnight, and 2 l of the reaction was transformed into TOP10 chemically competent cells according to the vendor's procedure (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA). Positive colonies were screened by PCR and enzyme digestion. Plasmid pTrinsp15 was isolated with QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif., USA) and submitted for DNA sequencing at the Genomic Core Facility, Purdue University. The plasmid was then transformed into BL21 (DE3) chemically competent cells for nsp15 expression. The predicted fusion nsp15 contained 377 amino acids (aa) including 338 aa from nsp15.

The deduced amino acid sequence of the TCoV nsp15 is shown in figure 1 a in alignment with nsp15s from other coronaviruses. From the alignment, it was found that important residues associated with nsp15 activity are conserved among the nsp15 polypeptides. To express the recombinant TCoV nsp15, plasmid pTrinsp15 was transformed into BL21 (DE3) cells. A typical expression pattern of TCoV nsp15 in BL21 (DE3) is shown in figure 1 b. After 3 h of induction with IPTG, there was no obvious nsp15 expression ( fig. 1 b) . After purification through Ni-NTA resin, a single band around 43 kDa was seen on SDS-PAGE. Western blotting with mouse anti-His mAb revealed that this band was His-tagged and was thus the expected fusion nsp15. We used this purified nsp15 for all other experiments. Figure 2 a shows that total RNA from BHK cells was rapidly degraded by nsp15. The degraded RNA formed smears, and as incubation time progressed, the degrad- ed RNA became smaller and smaller, indicating that the total RNA was randomly degraded by nsp15. However, nsp15 did not degrade either ssDNA or dsDNA ( fig. 2 b) , supporting characterization of nsp15 as a ribonuclease. Figure 3 shows that TCoV nsp15 quickly degraded poly(U) 50 but did not degrade poly(A) 50 . Figure 3 also shows that nsp15 did not degrade ssRNA oligo TJ1 which contained no U in the sequence. However, nsp15 degrad-ed TJ2, which contained UU in the middle of the sequence. Collectively, these data clearly demonstrated that nsp15 cleaves U-containing ssRNA with poly(U) as the preferable substrate. Figure 4 a shows degradation of hairpin RNA by nsp15. The hairpin RNA had a dsRNA region of 29-nt and a loop of 8-nt in the middle of the sequence and extra 3-nt at the 3 end. There were 14 potential cuts for nsp15 within the dsRNA region and two potential cuts within the loop region. When the reaction was incubated at 4\u00b0 for 12 h, there was almost no degradation of the RNA. When the incubation temperature was increased to 25\u00b0, two degraded bands appeared, indicating some degradation. The band sizes suggested that the RNA was cut at the loop region to generate dsRNA that separated into two different-sized ssRNA bands on the gel. When the incubation temperature was increased to 37\u00b0, the degradation rate increased greatly. Within 30 min, the input RNA was degraded and two product bands appeared. After 60 min, there was only one band detected. Two hours later, the band was weak and a smear appeared, suggesting the RNA was cleaved at the loop region containing the unpaired U. Although there were several Us within the dsRNA region, cleavage at these positions seemed unlikely.",

Figure 5 a shows that in the absence of added Mn 2+ , nsp15 cleaves ssRNA as quickly as in its presence, raising the question of whether divalent metal ions are required for nsp15 RNase activity.

Because TCoV is a group [12] . One possibility is that Mn 2+ enhances affinity between nsp15 and the RNA molecule. Recent data from SARS-CoV showing that Mn 2+ increased interaction between a SARS nsp15 mutant protein, H234A, and a synthetic RNA, rU16 [24] , are consistent with our hypothesis. RNA zymography demonstrated that the active form of the TCoV nsp15 is a hexamer. This was consistent with results obtained for SARS and MHV NendoU [12, 14] . Our data also revealed for the first time that disulfide bonds are involved in the formation of a trimer or hexamer and are essential for the enzymatic activity of the TCoV nsp15 ( fig. 6 ). The monomer or trimer showed no RNase activity. Intramolecular disulfide bonds within the TCoV nsp15 were observed. The hexamer form of NendoU was demonstrated in SARS and MHV NendoU [12, 14] . Recent crystal structure analysis revealed that the hexamer of NendoU of SARS-CoV and MHV was formed by two trimers through back-to-back interactions [12, 16] . Our zymography results about the TCoV nsp15 as well as data from other NendoU indicate the in vitro active form of the NendoU is a homohexamer; whether this is the case in vivo requires further investigation.",

Using reverse genetics, a point mutation in HCoV-229E NendoU resulted in a lack of viral genome replication and transcription [11] . However, no rescue experiment was performed to demonstrate that it was the RNase activity of the enzyme which caused the failure in genome replication and transcription. In EAV, extensive site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that the loss of the whole NendoU was lethal for the virus, while point mutations of the enzyme mostly affected the production of sgRNA [13] . Considering that the coronavirus genome is ssRNA, having two RNases (nsp14 and nsp15) in the genome seems peculiar for the virus. For the RNases to exert their functions but not degrade viral genomic RNA and sgRNA, the activity and specificity of the RNases must be under tight control. Therefore, it is expected that viral or cellular proteins play roles in regulating NendoU activity and specificity.",
