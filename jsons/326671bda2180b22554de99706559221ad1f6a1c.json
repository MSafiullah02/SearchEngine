To be clear, this self-isolation strategy is the correct and necessary one and is supported by modeling that highlights how reducing human-to-human contact could help to lessen the impact of the disease(2). However, the call for self-isolation has resulted in the reduction of in-person social interactions on a magnitude that the world has not experienced since the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918-1919. This social isolation will likely lead to an increase in depression, a link that has been established with previous studies in humans (3) and nonhuman mammals such as prairie voles (4) . Social isolation secondarily limits access to mental health resources, preventing many who need psychological help from getting it. Put together, there is an urgent demand for more accessible mental health services during this COVID-19 self-isolation period.",

For instance, high frequency (>5Hz) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for treatment resistant depression (TRD). Treatments typically require a TMS operator to hold a TMS coil over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to noninvasively pass electromagnetic pulses into this brain region that is under-activated in depression. A recent variant of this treatment for depression is using 360 pulses of daily low frequency (1Hz) rTMS to the right DLPFC, with the specific intention of evaluating this treatment paradigm for at-home administration (5) . Preliminary results using this approach have been promising, with 37.2% of patients having a 50% or greater reduction in depression symptoms after four weeks of daily treatments(5).",

These head-worn TMS coils could possibly allow future patients to selfadminister treatment without the presence of a TMS operator, opening up the possibility for athome use. These head-worn TMS coils also appear to be effective. In a single-blind trial, 15 daily sessions of rTMS with head-worn TMS coils significantly reduced depression scores compared to a sham stimulation condition and were non-inferior to standard TMS coils (6) . Other researchers have investigated the use of custom-built helmets that could hold existing, commercially available TMS coils over a stimulation target such as the DLPFC(7). These possibilities are intriguing but need further evaluation, particularly for the feasibility of selfadministered TMS. Thus, at-home rTMS should be further developed but may not translate quickly to at-home use during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Transauricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) uses a portable stimulation device that passes small electrical pulses (typically 1-12mA) through an electrode that is placed on vagal nerve afferents that project from the ear to the cortex. taVNS for depression builds on implanted cervical VNS, which is an effective and durable treatment for depression. In a recent single-arm feasibility trial, 10 sessions of 30 minute, 12mA taVNS to the bilateral mastoid processes produced an average drop of 19.75 points on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) in 12 patients with major depressive disorder (8) . There is a push for moving taVNS technology to at-home settings, which could help in this instance to mitigate the likely mental health burden of self-isolation to combat COVID-19. However, more evidence of the feasibility of self-administration and efficacy of this approach are needed before it is used at home.",

Several large, double-blind, randomized-controlled tDCS trials for depression have been conducted with mixed but promising results. In one trial, 22 sessions of daily 30 minute, 2mA tDCS over bilateral DLPFCs reduced depression scores by 9.0 points on the HDRS, significantly more than in a sham stimulation condition and non-inferior to the 11.3 point drop from escitalopram (9) . tDCS is particularly compelling as it has already been evaluated for at-home, self-administered use for multiple conditions including Parkinson's Disease(10) and could be easily adopted for depression due to self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
