Overall, without treatment, about 10% of individuals with LTBI will develop active TB disease at some time in their lives.2, 3 However, the underlying mechanisms of LTBI and its reactivation remain largely unknown. Host immune response against Mtb is complex and multifaceted. Identification of immune mediators which contribute to LTBI and reactivation is useful for early diagnosis, prevention and treatment of TB disease.",

Briefly, PBMCs were resuspended in appropriate volume of cold MagCellect buffer and labeled with negative selection biotinylated antibodies. Labeled cells were incubated with MagCellect Streptavidin Ferrofluid and MagCellect Magnet. CD4+ T cells were then enriched by depletion of unwanted cells. To achieve high purity of isolation, CD4+ T cells were negatively selected again from the above enriched cells. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the purity of isolated CD4+ T cells was more than 90% (Fig. S1). All samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until further use. Four samples of each group were used for microarray expression analysis and all samples were used for real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).",

No template control (containing all the reagents except template) was run to reduce the possible cross contamination from reagents as well as surfaces and no amplification control (including all the reagents other than reverse transcriptase) was used to eliminate genomic DNA contamination.

Role of lncRNAs in TB infection was just beginning to be explored and it was difficult to synthesize our results to reach a definitive conclusion based on this single study. As only 4 samples from each group were extensively evaluated, future studies are necessary to replicate, expand these findings in more patient samples. Moreover, further investigation of lncRNA roles may help to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of LTBI and its reactivation.",
