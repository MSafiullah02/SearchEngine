            "text": "The abdominal region is the large part of the body extending from the diaphragm to the pelvis. It includes the abdominal and pelvic cavities, bound by bone and muscle. The peritoneum is the largest and most complexly arranged serous membrane in the body. It forms the lining of the peritoneal cavity, which extends in abdominal cavity and contains the gastrointestinal tract; major abdominal organs, such as the liver, spleen, pancreas, urinary bladder, ovaries, and uterus; and many nerves, vessels, and lymph nodes. The peritoneum extends caudally in the pelvic cavity in males and females (as vaginal tunic and vaginal process, respectively). It is a serous membrane, divided into the parietal peritoneum, which covers the inner surface of the abdominal wall (the abdominal fascia) and the pelvic and scrotal cavities; the visceral peritoneum, which covers the abdominal, pelvic, and scrotal organs; and the connecting peritoneum, which extends between organs or between an organ and the parietal peritoneum, forming peritoneal folders that are divided into mesenteries, omenta, and ligaments. The purpose of the peritoneum is to provide a frictionless surface over which the viscera can move. It also serves as a site of fluid transport. A capillary film of serous fluid separates the parietal and visceral layers of the peritoneum from one another and lubricates the peritoneal surfaces. The retroperitoneal region extends dorsal to the peritoneal and pelvic cavities from the diaphragm to the pelvic inlet. It is bordered dorsally by the vertebrae and paraspinal muscles and laterally by the muscular abdominal and pelvic walls. The kidneys, ureters, and adrenal glands are considered to be retroperitoneal organs. The descending aorta, caudal vena cava, lumbar lymph nodes, cisterna chili, lymphatics, fat, and much of the abdominal wall musculature are also are also located in the retroperitoneum. The retroperitoneal cavity communicates cranially with the dorsocaudal mediastinum and caudally with the pelvic canal. Familiarity with these connections is important because diseases can spread easily among different body regions. MDCT studies performed with isotropic imaging and dorsal and sagittal reformation can fully delineate the peritoneal and retroperitoneal spaces and extent of diseases.",

In humans, contrast-enhanced MDCT is the primary imaging modality for the assessment of peritoneal pathology. Early detection of peritoneal changes is essential for the management of several neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions in veterinary patients. Contrast-enhanced MDCT scans with near-isotropic or isotropic resolution are necessary for fine evaluation of the abdominal cavity in dogs and cats. Most peritoneal and retroperitoneal pathological processes originate in the peritoneal and retroperitoneal organs. Therefore, a multiphasic approach (including the arterial phase and portal venous phase) provides adequate results in most instances. Performance of a third delayed series may be helpful for interpretation of pelvic pathological processes (e.g., prostatic, rectal, and vaginal diseases).",

It may be primary or secondary and generalized (i.e., diffuse) or localized (i.e., involving a small portion of the peritoneum). Primary septic peritonitis may occur as the result of the hematogenous spread of microorganisms; the most common example is feline infectious peritonitis caused by coronavirus infection (Fig. 1). Secondary septic peritonitis in dogs and cats results from gastrointestinal rupture (perforation, rupture, and surgical dehiscence), intraabdominal (hepatic, pancreatic, splenic, and prostatic) abscess, pyometra rupture, and penetrating injury. Noninfectious secondary chemical peritonitis can be caused by contact of irritants with the peritoneum in cases of urinary tract disruption (sterile uroabdomen); bile leakage caused by gallbladder rupture, hepatic torsion, or hepatobiliary surgical complication (bile peritonitis); and pancreatic disruption with leakage of exocrine pancreatic secretions (sterile bile peritonitis) (Figs. 2, 3, and 4).\n\n\n\n",

However, several acute and chronic peritoneal diseases have overlapping clinical and imaging features. In humans, three major patterns of peritoneal thickening are possible: smooth regular (uniform thickness, smooth interface with omental fat), irregular (nonuniform thickening of focal segments, irregular interface with omental fat), and nodular (well-defined nodules of variable diameter with soft tissue attenuation). Although inflammatory and neoplastic conditions may have similar CT appearances, the patient\u2019s clinical history and the analysis of the CT peritoneal pattern together with associated ancillary findings aid interpretation and differential diagnosis. Smooth uniform thickening is the prevalent pattern in most cases of acute peritonitis. Granulomatous peritonitis can show a diffuse nodular pattern that may mimic a malignant condition (Fig. 5). Peritoneal/omental necrosis and steatites may form mass-like lesions, which could be confounded with malignancy (Figs. 6 and 7). These MDCT features, described in humans, are similar to those we find routinely in dogs and cats, and they have been reported on in recent veterinary studies.\n\n\n",

The identification of the organ of origin of large masses can be easy when the mass is completely inside or clearly connected to it (Fig. 23). However, huge masses may occupy the majority of the abdominal cavity and show relationships with various organs. The role of MDCT in the assessment of masses possibly requiring resection is to demonstrate the organ of origin (if any); establish whether the tumor extends beyond that organ, invading/infiltrating adjacent organs or tissues; identify any vascular encasement/invasion and the affected vessel; and identify any evidence of local or distant metastasis (Fig. 24). In addition, it demonstrates any important anatomical displacement that may be problematic during surgery.\n\n",

Assessment of the displacement of normal anatomic structures is useful. Dorsal or lateral displacement of retroperitoneal organs, such as the kidney and ureters, may suggest a peritoneal origin. In contrast, ventral displacement of retroperitoneal organs and ventral displacement or encasement of major vessels (aorta, caudal vena cava) or their branches strongly suggests that the tumor has arisen in the retroperitoneum (Figs. 25 and 26). CT signs of large abdominal masses described in humans may be helpful for the assessment of such masses in veterinary patients as well. These are the \u201cbeak sign,\u201d in which the mass causes the edge of an adjacent organ to become beak shaped, meaning that it arises from that organ; the \u201cphantom organ sign,\u201d in which a small organ with a huge mass arising from it becomes undetectable; the \u201cembedded organ sign,\u201d in which part of a hollow organ appears to be embedded in the tumor; and the \u201cprominent feeding artery sign,\u201d which is particularly useful for the assessment of hypervascular lesions supplied by arteries that are sufficiently prominent to be visualized on CT (Figs. 27, 28, and 29).\n\n\n\n\n",

Direct inguinal hernia occurs when tissue protrudes through weakened or injured abdominal wall muscles, in a hernia sac formed by the parietal peritoneum. This kind of hernias is encountered commonly on MDCT examinations of patients with pelvic trauma and in non-traumatized dogs (Fig. 31). Indirect inguinal hernia is generally congenital and refers to the herniation of tissue into the inguinal canal through the deep inguinal ring in the tunica vaginalis. The organs most commonly involved in inguinal hernia are the omentum, small intestine, bladder, and uterus (Fig. 32).

The most common presentation is acute intestinal obstruction of small bowel loops, which develops through normal or abnormal apertures, such as foramina or defects in the mesentery or visceral peritoneum. MDCT signs differ depending on the subtype of internal hernia. These hernias result in the abnormal positioning of the stomach and/or bowel loops, which show signs of obstruction or strangulation. High-quality MDCT images obtained using a multiphasic approach are necessary for the evaluation of the mesenteric vasculature, which can show engorgement, twisting, and stretching (Fig. 33). Volumetric datasets must be assessed thoroughly to exclude inflammatory and neoplastic gastrointestinal conditions. Thin-slab MIP and VR are helpful for accurate image interpretation, especially for evaluation of the course and patency of the mesenteric vasculature.\n",
