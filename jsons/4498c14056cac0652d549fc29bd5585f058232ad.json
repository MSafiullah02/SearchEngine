Although for complex algebraic varieties, Chow rings are in general much more complicated than ordinary cohomology, it is shown in many cases that CH * (BG) is simpler than H * (BG; Z). On the other hand, Totaro [16] shows that the cycle class map (1.1) factors as where MU denotes the complex cobordism theory, and the second map T is the Thom map. The first mapcl is called the refined cycle class map. Therefore, the BP theory, being a p-local approximation of the MU theory, plays the role of a bridge between the Chow ring and the ordinary cohomology of BG. Indeed, it is an interesting problem to find out for which G is the refined cycle class map cl : CH * (BG)c l \u2212 \u2192 MU * (BG) \u2297 MU * Z an isomorphism. For this to hold, it is necessary that BP * (BG) concentrates in even dimensions. This property is studied for various G by Kono and Yagita [11] .",

In Section 3 we give some results on the ordinary cohomology of BP U n , most of which are proved in [5] and [6] , and presented in slightly different forms.
