The computing resources considered included the various databases currently available and the software that has been or might be used in analyses of these data. The various different kinds of databases identified as relevant included those holding ethnobotanical and/or chemical and/or pharmacological and/or toxicological data on the herbs used in Chinese medicine, as well as those that hold data on known or potential molecular targets for the herbal constituents. The software tools considered as relevant included programs that provide for (a) virtual screening of natural product libraries and chemical libraries, (b) pattern recognition, (c) bioinformatics studies relating to TCM and (d) the various data visualisation and statistical analysis packages for proteomics/genomics/metabolomics studies involving TCM.",

For the purposes of the review, in-silico studies were defined as those involving virtual screening and/or cheminformatics, but more widely would also include those involving bioinformatics and the various different types of \u2018omics\u2019 studies. The view was universally held that any such studies could not be fruitfully performed by non-specialists \u2013 even though the software tools were often easily accessed and easily used by those unfamiliar with computational chemistry. It was unanimously accepted that the performance of in-silico studies in CHM research necessitated close interaction between computational chemists and CHM experimentalists. Such interaction is common in the cross-disciplinary areas of molecular pharmacology and structural biology, and in-silico CHM research would thus present no exception.",

Over recent years the information available for Chinese herbs has increased quite dramatically, and the phytochemical classes found within individual plants are often characterised by a large variety of closely related constituents, many of which have been investigated in detail over the past few decades. A catalogue of the databases currently available and relevant to computational studies of CHM is presented in Table 1, Table 2\n. The databases listed include those holding (a) botanical information on TCM herbs, and the composition of TCM formulae and their usage, (b) information on the phytochemical constituents of plants (including those used in TCM and others), and (c) information on known and potential protein targets of the phytochemical constituents of herbs used in TCM. The databases containing category (a) and/or category (b) data are shown in Table 1; those containing data in category (c) are shown in Table 2.",

For intensive use, a CD/DVD version of a database is much preferable to a database accessed online (via the internet).\u2022It is important to distinguish between databases where users can output a list or batch file of chemical structures from a search, and those where this is not possible. It is often the case, for example, particularly with commercial databases, that structures have to be downloaded individually, and this must be regarded as a significant limitation/deficiency.\u2022The nature of the available chemical data held within the database is crucial to consider since this will impose limitations on the type(s) of database search and/or the type(s) of analysis that can be performed. It is important to discriminate between those databases that hold only 2D chemical structure data, those that hold 3D data on single conformers, and those that hold 3D data on multiple conformers. It is also important to discriminate those databases in which compound stereochemistry is unequivocally defined and those where stereochemistry is unspecified.\n",

(2007b) have used multiple decision trees to fish for compounds in Chinese herbs on the basis of structural similarity to known phytochemical inhibitors of targets involved in several disease processes, including inflammation, HIV and diabetes; they used Random Forest models to discriminate phytochemical inhibitors from 8000+ compounds found in 240 herbs. Target compounds that could not be distinguished from the known inhibitors for a given target on the basis of three different RF models (each employing a different set of molecular descriptors), were flagged as potential inhibitors of that target. Despite stringent selection criteria, around 62% of the plant species were hit at least once, with 50% of these predicted to have constituents active against two or more targets. Literature searches performed to corroborate these predictions, subsequently showed that 29% of the predicted classes within these herbs were supported by recent data, with \u223c80% of publications providing new information distinct from that used in constructing the RF models.",

            "text": "Inverse docking and target fishing are in-silico screening techniques that are used to identify protein targets ab initio. These techniques can thus be viewed as particularly pertinent in studies of phytochemicals. Indeed, two of the computer programs available have been specifically developed Chinese medicine in mind, to aid in elucidating the targets of TCM constituents. The first of these, INVDOCK (Chen and Zhi, 2001), is similar as regards docking methodology to Kuntz's DOCK program (Shoichet and Kuntz, 1993); it makes use of a database of protein cavities derived from PDB entries, and query compounds are tested for fit against some or all of these cavities to identify potential targets. The algorithm uses a shape matching alignment of the query compound to each protein cavity, with torsion optimisation and energy minimisation using the AMBER force field then employed to refine the fit. Protein cavities are defined using overlapping spheres following the approach of Kuntz et al. (Shoichet and Kuntz, 1993), and the database now holds \u223c9000 entries. Validation of the methodology, using phytochemicals with known targets (including ginsenoside Rg1, baicalin, quercetin, emodin, catchin and allicin), identified \u223c50% of the targets for which experimental data exist (Chen and Ung, 2002, Chen et al., 2003). INVDOCK has also been used to identify possible targets of the cytotoxic compound ganoderic acid D from the Chinese fungus Ganoderma lucidum (lingzhi), following investigation of its effects on expression of 21 different proteins. The results obtained suggest that it might bind eight of these receptors directly (Yue et al., 2008).",

This approach does have the drawback, however, that compounds that might find alternative modes of binding to the selected protein targets will not be identified as hits. The first use of this type of PDB-based pharmacophore method for target fishing for plant constituents was reported by Rollinger et al. (2009).

The databases and software that are currently available have been extensively reviewed elsewhere (Kouskoumvekaki and Panagiotou, 2011, Fiehn et al., 2011, Kamath et al., 2011), and the following section provides just a few selected examples.\u2022The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) is considered the most complete bioinformatics and chemoinformatics medical information database (Kouskoumvekaki and Panagiotou, 2011) with more than 6800 metabolite entries; it is fully searchable with tools for viewing, sorting metabolites and pathways, and provides customised, clickable metabolic maps, as well as disease information (Wishart et al., 2009).\u2022BiGG, Biochemical Genetic and Genomic knowledge base, is a metabolic reconstruction of human metabolism using both genetics and literature-based data to assess whether a reaction is present, providing confidence level data and Boolean relationships between genes, proteins and reactions (Schellenberger et al., 2010).\u2022The Small Molecule Pathway Database (SMPDB) is an interactive, visual database containing a limited number of small-molecule pathways found in humans, most of which cannot be found in any other pathway database. The SMPDB is used in metabolomics, transcriptomics and proteomics studies (Frolkis et al., 2010).\u2022\nGenomics Portals provides a database of human, mouse, and rat genomics data with basic analytical visualisation tools (Shinde et al., 2010).\u2022Examples of proteomic databases include GPDE, Griss Proteomics Database Engine, PRIDE, Proteomics IDEntifications database, and PeptideAtlas (Griss et al., 2011).\u2022Some databases are dedicated to specific fields of study. For example, T3TB, the Toxin and Toxin-Target Database, provides descriptions, mechanisms of action, and information on toxins and toxin-targets (Lim et al., 2010). CEBS, Chemical Effects in Biological Systems, is an integrated public repository focused on toxicogenomics, integrating data describing histopathological and biological measures with microarray and proteomics data (Waters et al., 2008).\n",
