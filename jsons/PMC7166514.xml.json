[12] demonstrated that CD13 is distributed homogeneously on single malignant melanoma cells but relocates to the zones of cell\u2010cell contact in homotypic cellular aggregates and to cell substrate adhesion sites, with filopodia showing a strong CD13 signal, suggesting a role for this molecule in cellular adhesion. It is surprising that although myeloid cells express the highest levels of CD13, a possible role for CD13 in monocytic intercellular interactions has been largely unexplored. In the promonocytic cell line U\u2010937 and in primary human monocytes and macrophages, we have reported that CD13 accumulates in zones of the membrane presenting filopodia and redistributes to the zones of contact between monocytic cells and their phagocytic targets [13]. These phenomena could be associated with a role for CD13 or its possible ligands in adhesion\u2010related functions in myeloid cells.",

For example, in immunobiology, cell\u2010cell and cell\u2010matrix interactions are crucial for antigen presentation, cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, leukocyte homing, and transendothelial migration [14, 15]. In tumor cell biology, during the postintravasation phases of tumor cells, HA has been proposed to play an important role in the establishment of metastasis by some types of tumors. For instance, Glinsky et al. [16] reported that heterotypic adhesion of breast and prostate metastatic cells to the endothelium and subsequent homotypic cell adhesion participate in hematogenous cancer metastasis. Finally, in angiogenesis, homotypic adhesion of endothelial cells is considered to be a crucial step in extension of new vessels [17].",

In this cell type, several monoclonal antibodies (mAb) capable of inducing HA have been described using U\u2010937 cells as a model. Among them are antibodies against CD98 [18], CD43 [19], CD147 [20], and CD29 [14, 21, 22].

An equal volume of medium, with or without the indicated inhibitor, was added to each well, and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for different periods of time (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 24, 48, and 72 h).

Aggregation was quantified by light microscopy and is presented as percentage of aggregation (number of cells in aggregates/total number of cells\u00d7100). As the size of the cell aggregates after 4 h of incubation made optical quantification impossible, images of each well were captured using a camera attached to a Zeiss Axiovert microscope, and quantification of cells in aggregates was performed using the colony\u2010counting function of Quantity One software (Bio\u2010Rad, Hercules, CA). Data are presented as aggregation indexes (AI) = [number of cells detected by the software as blue colonies in each image (aggregated cells)/total number of cells detected\u00d7100].

Settings of the software were adjusted to detect as blue colonies all aggregates formed by more than three to four cells, which present optical densities (OD) high enough to avoid erroneous detection of two close cells as aggregates. Thus, AI obtained by quantification with the software are lower than, but comparable with, the percentage of aggregation obtained by visual counting. Both evaluations always correlated consistently.

            "text": "For our initial evaluation of CD13 in monocytic cell adhesion, we used the U\u2010937 cell line as our model system, as it has been studied extensively in HA. To preclude the previously described functional cooperation between Fc receptors for IgG (Fc\u03b3Rs) and CD13 [13], we used F(ab)\u20322 fragments of the 452 antibody in all experiments. Initial experiments indicated that incubation of U\u2010937 cells with intact anti\u2010CD13 mAb 452 or its F(ab)\u20322 fragments induced HA (expressed as the percentage of aggregation=the number of cells in aggregates/total number of cells\u00d7100) in a dose\u2010dependent manner (\nFig. 1A\n). The percentage of cells in aggregates reached a plateau at antibody concentrations between 0.09 and 3 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 1A) and decreased with higher or lower concentrations. Aggregates were smaller in size at the lowest HA\u2010inducing concentration of the 452 mAb (0.09 \u03bcg/ml, Fig. 1A, open arrow). Therefore we chose the minimal dose required to induce aggregates of maximum size as our working antibody concentration throughout the study (3 \u03bcg/ml, Fig. 1A, solid arrow). It is important that Fab fragments of the 452 antibody were not able to induce HA of U\u2010937 cells, suggesting the necessity for CD13 cross\u2010linking for the induction of aggregation (not shown).",

Cellular aggregation peaked after 24 h of incubation with the mAb 452, and cells began to disaggregate after 48 h at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 1D).

As a control, we used bestatin, a well\u2010known inhibitor of aminopeptidase activity, which preferentially targets CD13 in the cell membrane [25]. As optimal induction of HA occurs at subsaturating antibody concentrations, we measured activity at saturating and optimal HA doses. As previously reported for myeloid cell lines [24], saturating concentrations of the WM\u20104.7 mAb had no effect on cell\u2010surface CD13 enzymatic activity (Fig. 3A, WM\u20104.7s), MY7 and 452 had a small but significant effect (MY7s, 452s), and bestatin and WM\u201015 mAb (WM\u201015s) inhibited activity by \u223c50% (residual enzyme activity is a result of other peptidases on the cell surface) [24]. In contrast, at doses optimal for HA induction, none of the aggregation\u2010inducing mAb inhibited enzymatic activity (452HA, MY7 HA, and WM\u201015HA, Fig. 3A). In addition, chemically blocking enzyme activity with inhibitory doses of bestatin neither induced aggregation nor affected HA induced by the 452 mAb (not shown). Furthermore, as shown later, EDTA, which is an irreversible inhibitor of APN enzymatic activity, had no effect on CD13\u2010mediated HA either. Taken together, these results indicate that anti\u2010CD13\u2010induced HA is independent of CD13 enzymatic activity.",

The binding sites of two of the three HA\u2010inducing mAb are known: WM\u201015 binds to the zinc\u2010binding domain of the enzyme, and MY7 binds to an epitope distinct but close to this domain [3, 23]. The binding epitope of the other HA\u2010inducing mAb, 452, is not known. WM\u20104.7 mAb, which is unable to induce HA, is known not to bind to the zinc\u2010binding domain [23]. With these data in mind, we carried out competition assays by flow cytometry. Preincubation of U\u2010937 cells with the 452 mAb efficiently blocked the subsequent binding of the MY7 mAb, suggesting that the epitopes recognized by both mAb are the same or close to one another (Fig. 3B). In contrast, preincubation of cells with the 452 mAb did not interfere with binding of the WM\u20104.7 mAb (Fig. 3C). Binding of the WM\u201015 mAb was not blocked by the 452 mAb (Fig. 3D) or by the MY7 mAb (not shown). Thus, as the epitopes recognized by WM\u201015 and MY7 (and consequently, 452) mAb are known to be closely located [23], these results suggest that the HA\u2010inducing capacity of the three mAb depends on their binding to a specific site, which lies close to the enzymatic active site of CD13.",

After 4 h, anti\u2010CD13 aggregation in the presence of anti\u2010CD29 mAb was 80.9% higher than that induced by the anti\u2010CD13 mAb alone. However, after 24 h, cells aggregating in the presence anti\u2010CD13 alone, reached the same levels of aggregation as those with the combination of anti\u2010CD29 and anti\u2010CD13 mAb (Fig. 5A). After 48 h, the anti\u2010CD13 mAb\u2010induced aggregation begins to decrease (Fig. 5B) until it disappears at 72 h (Fig. 5C). However, in the presence of the anti\u2010CD29 mAb alone or in combination with the anti\u2010CD13 mAb, cells remained aggregated at these incubation times (Fig. 5D).

Finally, the decrease in CD13\u2010induced cellular aggregation after 48 h (Fig. 5B) was also prevented by anti\u2010CD11a (Fig. 5E) and anti\u2010CD54 mAb (not shown), resulting in aggregates which persisted up to 96 h of incubation. These results suggest that although anti\u2010CD13 mAb\u2010induced aggregation appears to be independent of integrins, ligation of these molecules can increase it, apparently by stabilizing the cellular aggregates induced by anti\u2010CD13.",

Cells were preincubated for 2 h with a range of at least eight different concentrations of each inhibitor before the addition of the anti\u2010CD13 mAb. AI was determined at 4 and 24 h at the concentrations of inhibitors at which cell viability was not affected. The whole range of concentrations was tested in at least three independent experiments, and representative results are shown in \nFigure 7A\n. The most prominent effect was obtained with herbimycin, which completely inhibited CD13\u2010mediated HA, suggesting that Src kinases are indispensable for the process. Inhibitors of PI\u20103K, MEK\u20101, and p38 also inhibited HA importantly (79.39\u00b15.01%, 91.90\u00b10.18%, and 68.5 \u00b1 7.2%, respectively). Genistein inhibited HA in 35.88% \u00b1 3.92, and the lowest inhibitory effect was obtained with the PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I and Ro\u201031\u20108220 (48.72% and 43.10%, respectively). These results support the involvement of MAPK in CD13\u2010induced HA. As Grb2 is a common upstream adaptor protein involved in the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway, we tested a possible physical association between CD13 and Grb2, which binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues through its Src homology 2 domain. Sos is a guanosine 5\u2032\u2010diphosphate\u2010guanosine 5\u2032\u2010triphosphate exchange protein that binds Grb2 through proline\u2010rich sequences, providing a link between Grb2 and MAPK, usually through the activation of Ras. As shown in Figure 7B, Grb2 and Sos coimmunoprecipitate with CD13 from lysates of resting and aggregated U\u2010937 cells, further supporting the use of this signaling pathway by CD13 in monocytic cells. A lower amount of Grb2 and Sos was found to coprecipitate with CD13 from lysates of aggregated cells than from resting cells. The significance of the observed decrease in the association of Grb2 and Sos with CD13 after HA is, at present, unknown. As mentioned above, at high cellular densities, the aggregation and disaggregation phenomena occur faster. Thus, the observed decrease in the association of Grb2 and CD13 could probably be related to the disaggregation process. Figure 7C depicts a hypothetical signaling cascade, which may occur after CD13 cross\u2010linking on the cell membrane according to the data presented here, which coincide with the previous report of Santos et al. [26].",

Most of the functions so far attributed to CD13 have been reported to depend on its enzymatic activity. Thus, the observed differences in the ability of anti\u2010CD13 mAb to induce HA could be related to their distinct effect on APN activity. However, our results would argue that HA occurs independently of CD13 enzymatic activity for several reasons. First, the two anti\u2010CD13 mAb with the highest capacity to induce aggregation (452 and MY7) have little effect on the enzymatic activity at saturating concentrations or most importantly, at optimal doses for induction of HA. Second, the high concentrations of the WM\u201015 mAb required to inhibit enzymatic activity do not induce HA. However, this mAb induces HA at lower concentrations, which have no effect on APN activity. Third, the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin neither induces aggregation nor blocks HA induced by the 452 mAb at doses at which it inhibits enzymatic activity in these cells. Finally, CD13\u2010mediated HA is insensitive to EDTA, which is an irreversible inhibitor of zinc\u2010dependent APN enzymatic activity [27, 28]. Therefore, CD13\u2010induced monocytic aggregation appears to be independent of enzymatic activity. Similarly, CD13 enzymatic activity is not required for its role as a viral receptor [29, 30], suggesting that this surface molecule may have an array of functions that are independent of its enzymatic activity.",

In support of this theory, competition experiments revealed that the 452 mAb binds to an epitope overlapping with that recognized by the MY7 mAb. Previous epitope mapping studies have shown that MY7 and WM\u201015 mAb bind to different but closely located epitopes, which lie near the enzymatic active site [23], suggesting that binding to a specific site on CD13 close to the active center is necessary to induce aggregation. Accordingly, the WM\u20104.7 mAb, which is known to bind to an epitope distinct from the zinc\u2010binding domain and different from that recognized by the HA\u2010inducing mAb, does not induce HA. Furthermore, the MY7 and WM\u201015 mAb, but not the WM\u20104.7 mAb, block binding of the human coronavirus 229E to CD13 [3, 29, 30], again supporting the conclusion that both mAb bind to closely spaced epitopes. It is interesting that it has been reported that binding of the anti\u2010CD13 F23 mAb (which is blocked by the WM\u201015 mAb) induces a conformational change in the extracellular domain, resulting in the exposure of cryptic epitopes [31]. Therefore, it is possible that binding and cross\u2010linking of CD13 by the aggregation\u2010inducing mAb could trigger a proadhesive signal transduction cascade and a conformational change, which results in the exposure of a cryptic epitope responsible for binding or dissociation of an adhesion\u2010related ligand.",

Thus, we evaluated possible changes in integrin expression and possible cross\u2010inhibition of CD13\u2010mediated HA by integrin\u2010specific antibodies. As opposed to HA mediated by CD29 [14], CD43 [19], or phorbol 12\u2010myristate 13\u2010acetate [32], CD13\u2010mediated aggregation is independent of the integrins lymphocyte function\u2010associated antigen\u20101/intercellular adhesion molecule\u20101 (CD11a\u2010CD18/CD54) and CD29. The expression of these molecules was unchanged during CD13\u2010induced aggregation, and the respective mAb did not have a significant inhibitory effect on it. On the contrary, antibodies directed against CD29, CD11a, and to a lesser extent CD54, appeared to stabilize cellular aggregates, as they remained intact for longer periods of time. We used an anti\u2010CD29 mAb capable of inducing a HA response that lasted up to 96 h (not shown). This suggests that aggregation induced by the anti\u2010CD29 mAb alone is more stable, and thus, in the presence of both mAb, the longer duration and the increase in CD13\u2010induced aggregation may be the result of the sum of two independent phenomena. Conversely, neither the anti\u2010CD11a nor the anti\u2010CD54 mAb used had the property of inducing aggregation by itself (Fig. 5A), which rather suggests a stabilizing effect of these molecules after ligation by the specific antibodies. As EDTA blocks integrin\u2010mediated adhesion, the observation that EDTA has no effect on CD13\u2010mediated HA further supports the conclusion that this phenomenon does not depend on integrins.",

To answer this question, we tested the effect of temperature, 2\u2010D\u2010glucose, and sodium azide on CD13 mAb\u2010induced aggregation. Incubation of cells in the presence of optimal doses of the aggregation\u2010inducing antibodies at 4\u00b0C completely abrogated aggregation. In addition, 2\u2010D\u2010glucose at the concentrations commonly used to block glycolysis had a clear, inhibitory effect on aggregation. These results suggested that CD13\u2010mediated HA is an active and energy\u2010 and probably signal transduction\u2010dependent process. The MY7 and WM15 mAb had been shown to trigger signal transduction involving tyrosine and MAPK in U\u2010937 cells [26]. Our results show that the 452 mAb is also able to trigger a signal transduction cascade, which most probably, is involved in HA. The data obtained with chemical inhibitors clearly implicate tyrosine kinase and MAPK pathways in the signaling cascade involved in HA. The involvement of tyrosine kinases in the process, demonstrated here by inhibition of the HA by herbimycin and by the partial inhibition by genistein, suggested that the Grb2/Sos/Ras/MAPK pathway was involved. Here, we show that the two upstream components of this signaling cascade, Grb2 and Sos, coprecipitate with CD13 in monocytic cells. We have found a constitutive association among these molecules, which persists during aggregation and decreases when cells start to disaggregate. The link between CD13 and Grb2 is still to be identified. As part of the population of CD13 resides in lipid rafts, and the adaptor linker for activation of T cells (LAT) is highly enriched in these domains in monocytic cells, the possibility of this protein being the bridge between CD13 and the MAPK pathway can be proposed. New experiments are necessary to test this hypothesis.",

This result is in keeping with reported results indicating that colchicine and nocodazole (another regulator of microtubule dynamics) increase mobility and activation of integrins and that nocodazole alone induces aggregation of the macrophage cell line J774 [33], although colchicine did not induce aggregation of U\u2010937 cells in our hands. Although our current results strongly suggest that CD13\u2010mediated aggregation is independent of integrins per se, the stabilization in the cellular aggregates at long periods of incubation observed by coincubation with anti\u2010integrin antibodies could be similar and perhaps even related to the effect observed with colchicine. It is also tempting to propose that a distinct type of microtubule\u2010dependent mechanism operates during HA, for example, a similar release of CD13 from cytoskeletal constraints with a consequent increase in its mobility in the cell membrane. When comparing CD13\u2010mediated aggregation with aggregation induced by other molecules in U\u2010937 cells, it is interesting that the same doses of colchicine, which enhanced aggregation induced by CD13, block aggregation mediated by CD98 and CD29.",

The fact that CD13 is polarized only when cells are in close proximity further strengthens this conclusion. Also, CD11a, which stabilizes the CD13\u2010induced cellular aggregates at long incubation times, does not redistribute to the zones of cell\u2010cell contact, demonstrating that the CD13 redistribution observed is specific and not dependent on bivalent antibody\u2010mediated cross\u2010linking.

Future work will focus in determining the molecular mechanisms directing this process and its possible physiological and physiopathological implications. For example, CD13 and several molecules known to mediate HA have been shown to participate in immune responses, as anti\u2010CD13 mAb block dendritic cell (DC)\u2010mediated T cell activation in vitro [34]. In light of our data, it is tempting to propose a role for CD13 in the stabilization of such cell\u2010cell interactions. Under these circumstances, CD13 could act as a signal regulator [35] or costimulatory molecule, which by definition, decreases the threshold for activation of the immunoreceptor by stabilizing cell\u2010cell contacts and/or increasing the presence of the receptor in signal\u2010controlling membrane domains (i.e., lipid rafts), as we have proposed to occur during Fc\u03b3R\u2010mediated functions [13, 35]. In other cell types, HA also has an important role. Thus, in DC, HA has been shown to be a mechanism of intercellular communication involved in the interchange of maturation signals and in antigen transfer [36]. It is interesting that DC have been shown to express high levels of CD13, and CD13 participates in DC maturation [34, 37, 38, 39]. Thus, it could be interesting to determine the relationship between CD13\u2010mediated HA and maturation. Another cell type in which HA plays key roles is neutrophils. In these cells, HA occurs upon activation and is of great relevance in many processes, such as acute inflammation and acute coronary syndromes [40, 41]. CD13 has been shown to participate in both processes. Finally, because of the role of CD13 as a viral receptor [3, 4], it would also be interesting to determine the implications of CD13\u2010mediated aggregation in viral infection\u2010related cell fusion and syncitium formation. It is interesting that the mAb that induce HA are the ones reported to block viral infection [29, 30], and the mAb that does not induce HA is known not to inhibit viral infection.",

U\u2010937 cells were incubated with Texas Red\u2010labeled anti\u2010CD13 mAb 452 (0.39 \u03bcg/ml) in a glass\u2010bottom culture dish in RPMI\u20101640 phenol red\u2010free complete medium. Time\u2010lapse imaging at 2\u2010min intervals was performed in a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope equipped with a Zeiss heater temperature control system and including an objective heater (original magnification, \u00d763). Images were analyzed and exported using the Zeiss LSM Image Browser 3.5.0.223. Numbers represent the incubation time in minutes. Time 0 corresponds to 10 min of incubation at 37\u00b0C with the mAb before the beginning of imaging. The cell indicated by the green asterisk relocates CD13 to the zone of its membrane, which is closer to the two surrounding cells; however, as soon as those cells begin to migrate away, polarization of CD13 is lost. The cell marked by the blue asterisk polarizes CD13 to the zone of its membrane, where it starts to approach the surrounding cells, that proximity is lost (4\u2010min image), and the cell turns clockwise (10\u2010min image) until it relocates the zone of polarized CD13 toward its new aggregation partners (28\u2010min image). The cell marked by the white asterisk progressively moves from the center of the field toward the aggregate, showing increasing levels of CD13 polarization along the way. At 10 min of incubation, one cell approximates to its left, and it turns counter\u2010clockwise, showing CD13 polarized to that side at 13 min. As this contact is not established, it turns clockwise again until it ends, establishing contact with the rest of the main aggregate at the right half of the field. The cell marked by the yellow asterisk is clearly not polarized at the beginning of incubation, but as soon as it makes contact with its aggregation partner, it starts turning counter\u2010clockwise, until at the end of incubation, it shows CD13 completely polarized to the zone of cell\u2010cell contact. Finally, the cell marked with the green asterisk polarizes CD13 during the period of time at which it is in close proximity with other cells. However, as the other cells move away, this cell loses its polarity and stays in the same place during all the incubation. This indicates that movement of cells does not occur at random. As a control, a FITC\u2010labeled anti\u2010CD11a was used during anti\u2010CD13\u2010induced HA, and no redistribution of CD11a was seen at any time of incubation (last image).",
