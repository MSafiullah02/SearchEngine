Some authors have demonstrated a strong relation between viral infection [2], [3], [4] and recurrent pharyngotonsillitis. There are many viruses involved in the pathogenesis of pharyngotonsillitis including adenoviruses, parainfluenza viruses, rhinoviruses, herpes simplex viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, Epstein\u2013Barr viruses (EBV), influenza viruses, coxsackie A viruses, corona viruses, and cytomegaloviruses [2], [3], [5], [6]. In spite of high prevalence of viral infection in adenotonsillar tissue, the methods to detect viruses make this approach difficult in routine practice [2], [3], [5], [6].",

            "text": "Commonly causing infectious mononucleosis, EBV is a member of \u03b31-herpesvirus and has a genome comprised approximately 172 nucleotide base pairs [7]. EBV has a linear genome which is characterized by a distinctive sequence reiteration. At the termini there are 20 copies of a 500 bp repeated sequence that is complementary and therefore permits circularization of the linear genome to form the EBV episome. EBV episome is the molecular basis for latent infection. It is a circular intracellular form of genome that maintains a persistent relationship within the cell, like an autonomous piece of DNA situated in the chromatin [7], [8]. EBV is B-lymphotropic and has the ability to transform memory B-cells into blast cells, with permanent proliferation, leading to tonsillar enlargement [9]. EBV is associated not only with infectious mononucleosis but also with benign diseases, such as oral hairy leukoplakia, and malignancies, such as Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma and breast carcinoma. It is recently being associated with autoimmune diseases, such as lupus erythematosus and multiple sclerosis [7], [10], [11]. For these reasons, our study is designed to identify the magnitude of EBV infection and types and pattern of distribution of EBV-infected cells in tonsils and adenoids among UAE population which will be of great help in future planning to prevent this infection.",

Forty-six paraffin blocks of tonsillectomy specimens and another 46 paraffin blocks of adenoidectomy specimens were available for this study. The available Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemical stained sections were reviewed. The age, sex, and clinical presentation were obtained by reviewing all the histopathologic reports and request forms of all cases. For the detection of EBV, two methods were used to increase the specificity and sensitivity of detection, the streptavidin-biotin immunohistochemical immunoperoxidase method to detect Epstein\u2013Barr virus latent membrane antigen type I (EBV-LMP-1) and in situ hybridization (ISH) for EBV encoded RNA (EBER).",

With each batch of cases studied, positive and negative control slides were also run. The positive control slide was a known case of EBV positive HL to which a specific EBER oligonucleotide probe was added. The negative control slide was another section of the same case of known EBV positive HL to which a random probe consisting of fluorescein labeled oligonucleotide cocktail was added. In addition, for each case studied two sections were used; the EBER oligonucleotide probe was added to one section, and the random probe was added to the other. Using this random probe as a negative background control alongside the EBV probe contributes to the validation of staining obtained by the EBV probe. If this negative control slide showed significant background staining in a particular case, the slide having the EBER probe was considered non-interpretable and the test was repeated for that particular case.",

In this study we show that EBV is prevalent in 43% of tonsils and 15% of adenoids. It is interesting to see all our cases are children, a finding seen by Endo et al. too [21], indicating that tonsillar and adenoidal hypertrophy occur mainly during this age group. It is well known that EBV has a tropism for the oral and nasopharyngeal tissues, and leads to lymphocytic proliferation [21]. The role of oropharyngeal epithelial cells as a reservoir of EBV was already suggested [21]. We show EBV only inhabits B lymphocytes in tonsils and adenoids, but not T lymphocytes or epithelial cells indicating that B lymphocytes are the main reservoir for EBV. Hudnall et al. [22], showed EBV to be rarely found within epithelial cells and T lymphocytes in EBV-infected tonsils.",

In peripheral blood, the virus is present in small resting memory B cells with latent gene expression limited to EBER, LMP2a, and perhaps EBNA1 [19]. It is well known that the interleukin 10 (IL-10) coding sequence is highly homologous to the EBV open reading frame BCRF1\n[23]. BCRF1 protein, also termed viral IL-10 (vIL-10), inhibits the synthesis of T-helper 1 cytokines [24] and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) activity [25]. Therefore, EBV-associated antigen-specific CTL activity might be down-regulated by vIL-10 in EBV-infected areas of the tonsil. Hence, EBV is much more likely to survive in the face of immune surveillance in the tonsils, suggesting that the immune response to EBV in tonsils may be different from that in peripheral blood [25]. The prevalence of EBV infection in tonsils varies according to the detection method. Studies using the ISH for detecting EBER found 26%, [26] 29%, [3] and 65% [27] association of the EBV with tonsillitis. While in our study the prevalence of EBV infection in tonsils is 43%, which is intermediate between these studies and reflects a possible geographical difference in the prevalence of EBV.",

            "text": "Identification of a high prevalence (43%) of EBV-EBER in tonsillectomy specimens in children suggests that the tonsils are the main reservoir for the EBV, and that this virus may be involved in tonsillar enlargement. On the other hand, the prevalence of EBV in adenoids (15%) is lower than in tonsils (43%), which indicate a lower association between adenoid hypertrophy and EBV infection. This finding is different from that found by Endo et al. [21] which found the prevalence of EBV to be higher in adenoids (57%) than tonsils (29%) by using similar method for detection (ISH), suggesting sampling and geographical differences. In this study, the immunohistochemical staining method was used to detect LMP-1 in tonsils and adenoids with the aim of strengthening our results in combination with EBER-ISH. The results are not encouraging since we detect EBV in only 5 cases (11%) and in few cells within the interfollicular area. This finding is less than that reported by Dias et al. [16], indicating a lesser expression of LMP-1 in EBV infected cells. In addition, it indicates that using EBER-ISH is the gold standard for detecting EBV in tissue. Moreover, the use of EBER-ISH in the detection of EBV is more suitable since we can use it on paraffin-embedded tissue, which allows us to test archive material when required. This makes ISH superior to immunohistochemistry in the detection of EBV in tissue.",

Few follicles contained numerous EBER-positive cells. These results are consistent with previous reports of EBER-positive germinal center B-cells in tonsils [30]. It has been suggested that germinal center centroblasts may be a site of EBV persistence [31]. The presence of EBV-positive B-cells in germinal centers is reportedly more common in tonsils from areas endemic for EBV related lymphomas; leading to the suggestion that EBV-infected germinal center B-cells may be more prone to malignant transformation, perhaps due to somatic hypermutation [30]. In this study EBER-positive cells were found within germinal centers of tonsils and adenoids, and some of these cells were atypical and large and might be a precursor for malignant transformation. Although the pattern of distribution of EBER-positive B lymphocytes in the interfollicular regions is random, they have 3 distinct patterns within lymphoid follicles; either within germinal center cells, or mantle zone cells or in the interphase between them. The interphase pattern is very interesting and involves some follicles which have one or more EBER \u2013positive atypical cell within the germinal center. The interphase EBER-positive cells are distributed circumferentially in a round shape at the interphase between germinal center cells and mantle zone cells (Fig. 1C and D) as if they were generated from cell division of EBV-infected germinal center cells and moving outside the lymphoid follicle. Whether this pattern has any role in EBV-persistent infection in tonsils and adenoids or carrying any risk for future malignant transformation needs to be determined in future studies.",

            "text": "On the other hand, EBER was not identified within T-lymphocytes when we use triple staining for EBER, CD20 and CD3 (Fig. 4). Hudnall et al. [22], shows that EBV is rarely found in T lymphocytes in EBV-infected tonsils. There is some controversy regarding the role of oropharyngeal epithelial cells in EBV infection. It has been suggested that primary and persistent EBV infection might be mediated through oropharyngeal epithelial cells [32]. The support for this perception has come mainly from infection detected in desquamated oropharyngeal epithelial cells from patients with infectious mononucleosis by in situ hybridization [33]. However, there is now increasing evidence pointing to B lymphocytes as the likely site of persistent EBV infection, and also as the possible target of primary EBV infection [34]. Several studies have demonstrated EBV replication within the upper epithelial cell layers in oral hairy leukoplakia and are not accompanied by detectable latent infection of basal epithelial cells [35], [36]. Thus, these results do not support the idea that EBV persists in epithelial cells. In our study we do not identify EBV in epithelial cells of tonsils and adenoids whereas it is only detected in B lymphocytes. We think that EBV infection might be mediated through oropharyngeal epithelium at early stages of acute infection but later on, the virus might have left epithelial cells or the infected epithelial cells died as a result of host antiviral immunological reaction, hence we do not have EBV persistence and latency within epithelial cells in our samples. On the other hand, we believe that B lymphocytes are sites of primary infection and latency in tonsils and adenoids.",
