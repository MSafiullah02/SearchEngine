            "text": "PEDV is a disease of swine causing major losses to the industry in the US and worldwide (Gerdts and Zakhartchouk 2017). Newborn piglets are especially susceptible with attendant high mortality. The disease was first identified in Europe in the early 1970s, then in Asia in 2010, and in the United States in 2013. It continues to be a major problem in the United States, China, and many other countries. PEDV is a positive strand enveloped RNA virus of family Coronaviridae with a genome of 28 kb. The virus is divided into phylogenetic genotypes GIa, GIb, GIIa, GIIb, and GIIc (Guo et al. 2019), with GIa containing older strains such as CV777 and GIIa most prevalent in the United States. The spike protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein that binds the cellular receptor aminopeptidase N and recognizes sugar moieties. Although the spike protein is not actually cleaved, it is divided into subunits known as S1 and S2, largely based on homology to other related viruses (Chang et al. 2002; Sun et al. 2008). The S1 moiety contains a high number of neutralizing epitopes and is further subdivided into subdomains S10, S1A, S1B, S1C, and S1D.",

There is a clear need for a low-cost and more effective vaccine for PEDV. In particular, a subunit vaccine based on the spike protein as the primary immunogen is desirable due to its several neutralizing epitopes. A number of prototype vaccines based on different portions of the spike protein have stimulated promising immune responses in animal studies (Oh et al. 2014; Makadiya et al. 2016). These include immunogens based on the S1 moiety (Oh et al. 2014) (Makadiya et al. 2016), the S2 moiety (Okda et al. 2017), and a smaller portion known as the core neutralizing epitope or COE (amino acids 499\u2013638) that has been identified as containing neutralizing epitopes (Chang et al. 2002). However, the existing and many prototype vaccines require injection, which is labor-intensive and not likely to induce the strong mucosal response thought to be required for better protection against transmission across the mucus membranes. In addition, although progress has been made (Van Noi and Chung 2017), the protein has been difficult to produce at high levels in several recombinant systems (Makadiya et al. 2016; Piao et al. 2016).",

Precedent for oral immunization for PEDV includes a number of studies expressing PEDV S or N proteins in probiotics such as Lactobacillus. Feeding of these products elicits an immune response and protection upon challenge in a mouse model (Di-qiu et al. 2012; Hou et al. 2018). The PEDV spike protein has also been produced in tobacco (8\u201320 \u00b5g/g wet weight or up to 5% total soluble protein (TSP)), rice (0.083% TSP), and other plants, and elicits an immune response with neutralizing activity against the virus in mice (Bae et al. 2003) (Kang et al. 2005) (Huy et al. 2012; Huy and Kim 2019). If this protection could be achieved in a system in which the antigen is stable during production and transport, and that does not require purification of the antigen away from other toxic compounds, a significant reduction in cost would be achieved, which could facilitate adoption of oral vaccines.",

            "text": "Direct oral administration with minimal processing makes maize grain a good option for commercial operations assuming it provides effective protection against the desired pathogen. The maize system has many inherent properties making it amenable to development of practical low-cost oral vaccines for livestock. In addition to high expression levels, a plant-produced antigen should be stable to allow for a low cost of production and storage. Seeds such as maize grain have evolved to maintain proteins in a stable environment, allowing germination after years of dormancy, in contrast to vegetative tissue or fruits that undergo degradation shortly after harvest. This stability has been demonstrated for recombinant proteins that retain activity after being stored for years in the grain and allows for long-term storage, transport at ambient temperatures, and processing of the grain at will rather than a requirement to process large batches immediately upon harvest (Hayden et al. 2012). Stability can be further increased by removal of oils by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), a process we have demonstrated for other antigens (Hayden et al. 2014). Bioencapsulation of the antigen in maize grain has been shown to help maintain antigenic determinants during passage through the digestive system leading to a higher immune response relative to purified protein, and the immune response may also be enhanced upon SFE treatment, as has been shown in other cases (Hayden et al. 2014). Early studies with a spike protein from another coronavirus, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), demonstrated that an orally-delivered maize-based candidate vaccine elicits an immune response and provides protection on challenge in pigs (Lamphear et al. 2004). Several other maize-based vaccines have also shown efficacy in animal trials (Hayden et al. 2015) and safety in a human clinical trial (Streatfield et al. 2002). There is also one report of expression of the PEDV spike protein COE in maize, which elicited an immune response in mice (Man et al. 2014).",

Maize flour containing S1 with an ER-targeting signal was orally administered to piglets and elicited a neutralizing serum antibody response.

The nucleotide sequence of the coding region was outsourced for commercial gene synthesis by GenScript. Six different constructs were prepared (Fig. 1) with varying subcellular targets and fusions. The native signal sequence was replaced with a barley alpha amylase signal sequence (BAASS) for cell wall targeting in constructs PDA, PDC, PDD, PDK, and PDM, and with a vacuolar targeting sequence in construct PDB. The S1 coding region (aa 23\u2013738 for constructs PDA, PDB, PDC, and PDB or aa 23\u2013789 for constructs PDK and PDM) was synthesized for transfer into the maize transformation vector pSB11 (Komari et al. 1996) using an NcoI site overlapping the initiating ATG and a PacI restriction site in the terminator region to add the coding region downstream of the promoter. For the other constructs, smaller portions of the coding region containing, for example, the KDEL ER targeting sequence, were commercially synthesized to exchange with portions of the full-length coding region by restriction digestion with EcoRI and HindIII and ligation. All constructs except one, PDD, incorporated the S1 coding region under control of a promoter derived from the maize globulin-1 gene (pr25 or pr44) which target expression to the embryo. In construct PDM an engineered version of the pr25 promoter, pr44, contains two extra copies of the 5\u2032 region of pr25 (Hayden et al. 2012).

            "text": "We have demonstrated relatively high levels of accumulation in maize grain of the PEDV spike protein S1 with an ER-targeting signal. Current estimates of expression are at least 20 mg/kg seed. Although limited availability of suitable reagents have precluded development of an ELISA at this time, in future work we will continue refine the accuracy of this estimate. Typically, at least a tenfold increase in expression can be achieved through a program of traditional back-crossing into elite germplasm and selecting the highest-expressing ears at each generation (Hood et al. 2012). Thus we can predict long-term yields of the antigen to be at least 200 mg/kg and most likely higher. With average grain production at 200 mg antigen/kg seed and a dose of 20 mg, one acre can produce 0.8 kg antigen or 40,000 doses. Therefore a typical small farm of 160 acres can produce over 6 million doses. This level of scale-up can allow for the cost-efficient production of a subunit vaccine, especially as this antigen has been very difficult to express in other systems. More critically, however, we have also shown that after the virus challenge, maize-produced and orally delivered S1 was able to elicit serum neutralizing antibodies in pigs at levels similar to those elicited by the commercial injected vaccine post-challenge. Prior to the virus challenge, little serum neutralizing antibody response was detected in the group fed maize-produced S1 or control maize. This observation is similar to earlier results with TGEV that showed significant titers only after the viral challenge. Presumably, this is due to a response below the limits of detection after the first boost of the vaccine. The maximum SNA titer 15 days after challenge and 8 weeks after primary immunization was 192 to 271, or 7.6 to 8.0 converted to a base-2 log scale. Several variables make direct comparison difficult, but in one study by Oh et al. (2014), injection of recombinant S1 protein let to SNA levels of approximately 8 to 32 on a log2 scale at three and six weeks after primary immunization, respectively. In the study by Makadiya et al. maximum titers of approximately 90 (unconverted titer) are reported after injection of purified recombinant protein (Makadiya et al. 2016). In a more recent report (Choe et al. 2020), a similar neutralizing antibody titer of 7\u20138 on a log 2 scale was obtained on oral immunization with S1-containing microspheres. The work presented here indicates that the orally-delivered S1 produced in maize can elicit a response similar to other subunit vaccine delivery systems.",

Once the system is established for one PEDV strain it should be possible to prepare new maize lines expressing the S1 protein from different strains with different sequences as needed.",

Promoters pr25 and pr44 target expression to the embryo and promoter pr39 targets expression to the endosperm. The BAASS signal sequence targets expression to the cell wall but addition of the KDEL sequence causes the protein to be retained in the ER. Construct PDB contains a signal sequence targeting expression to the vacuole. The spike protein coding region from the Colorado 2013 strain is either amino acids 23\u2013738 (S1) or amino acids 23\u2013789 (S1ext). All constructs contain the PinII terminator sequence.

The protein was transferred to PVDF membrane and incubated with polyclonal rabbit antibody raised to commercially synthesized COE portion of the spike protein (shown as a positive control at the right). Note that in all cases except PDC T3 generation, T1 generation seed crossed to untransformed maize is shown and half of the seed are expected to be positive. PDC T3 has been self-crossed leading to expression in all seeds. The predicted sizes for PDC, PDK, PDM and the COE are 81.2 kDa, 97.6 kDa, 87.4 kDa, and 16.1 kDa respectively. The expected segregation pattern with a robust band in approximately half the seed in T1 generation plants and not in untransformed maize (not shown) is indicative of specificity, while other non-specific bands were observed in all seed. However, the bands for maize-produced S1 run at a higher apparent molecular weight than predicted, possibly due to post-translational modifications such as glycosylation",
