The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has even recently resorted to recommending the use of scarfs or bandanas instead of necessary masks and N95 respirators [3, 5] . In turn, many hospitals are relying on community donations, including selfmade masks and makeshift face shields, all of which puts health care workers at major risk of infection.",

According to the American Medical Association Code of Medical Ethics, physicians have a professional obligation to act in the best interests of patients and to do no harm, even in the face of greater 3 than usual risks to their own safety, health, or life [6] . This leads to a difficult question: should we provide care without adequate protection? During the Black Plague of the Middle Ages, many of the already few health care professionals at the time left their practices and moved with their families to rural retreats -along with many others -in order to avoid becoming infected in crowded cities while treating patients [7] . SARS-1 (2002-2004) did not reach the global scale of SARS-CoV-2, but nevertheless stimulated consideration of important ethical issues in the provision of care. At that time, shortages of PPE and a lack of sufficient dedicated infectious disease specialty care led to a disproportionate surge of health care worker infections early on during the SARS outbreak in East Asia [8] . In 2015 Ebola's high case-fatality rate put West African low-income countries with fragile health systems and limited health care supplies at extremely high risk, costing the lives of hundreds of health care workers [9] .",

The consequences of providing care without adequate PPE, however, are also grave -health care workers potentially become ill, infect their colleagues, patients, and families, and are removed from the workforce. This not only decreases the human resources available to care for a population in crisis, but also transforms health care workers into vectors for the disease they are working to eradicate. Without PPE, providers cannot perform their ethically-required duties towards their patients. Those who seek to avoid doing harm by caring for patients under these circumstances are at risk of perpetuating an arguably greater harm. Moreover, a substantial loss of workforce as a result of a lack of PPE, especially those more vulnerable to a complicated CoVID-19 disease progression, leads to a loss of skilled workers, experienced teachers, and specialists after the pandemic ends. Reports from China and Italy illustrates the loss of many health care workers across all disciplines and the cross-training of, for example, surgical specialists to cover emergency departments and intensive care units [10, 11] .",

The existing supply of PPE should be conserved as much as possible, which implies canceling elective surgeries, limiting participation of non-essential medical personnel in direct patient care, re-using PPE, and allocating PPE only for higher risk exposures. To help ensure adequate supplies of PPE for those on the front lines, community donations, existing manufacturers, newly converted factories, and in-house innovations can be engaged.",

Examining the integrated surveillance data from Italy and Spain earlier in the country's outbreak, 20% of infections were seen in health care workers. In the mass shortage of PPE, studies comparing non-medical grade masks with medical masks demonstrated significantly higher rates of infection amongst health care workers using nonmedical-grade masks due to poor filtration and moisture retention [13] . Furthermore, in a study comparing medical-grade surgical masks with N95 respirators, the use of medical-grade surgical masks was associated with significantly higher rates of CoVID-19 infection [14] . Thus, while some protection is better than none, the shortage of PPE and the risks to health care workers spread as quickly as SARS-CoV-2 itself. We can learn from the experiences of our colleagues across the planet. The pandemic is global and its lessons on the importance of protecting the health care workforce are global as well.",
