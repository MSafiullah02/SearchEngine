Indeed, the overall mortality rate of septic shock remains particularly high in cirrhotic patients, ranging from 60% to 100% [5-7], raising the question of indications of aggressive and extensive organ failure support in such patients.",

Of note, the most significant improvements in survival from septic shock have been achieved in vulnerable subgroups including elderly patients, those with malignancies [9,10] or neutropenia [11]. Cirrhotic patients are usually excluded from interventional trials in sepsis, but it is likely that such a high-mortality subgroup would particularly benefit from therapeutic advances in septic shock. In addition, great strides have also been recently achieved in the management of specific complications of cirrhosis. Whether the survival gain achieved by therapeutic advances in septic shock also extends to cirrhotic patients has not been assessed. In order to determine the trend in mortality of cirrhotic patients with septic shock and the impact of related therapeutic interventions, we performed a retrospective single-center study over a 14-year time period.",

All patients with histological or clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis and presenting with septic shock at the time of ICU admission or within the first 48 h in the ICU were included. Septic shock was defined as a microbiologically proven or clinically suspected infection, associated with acute circulatory failure requiring vasoactive support despite adequate fluid filling [12]. Senior staffing remained quite stable over the 14-year study period. ICU admission decisions were taken on by both the intensivist and the referring hepatologist throughout the study period. Therefore, only patients with end-stage liver disease declined for liver transplantation were not admitted to the ICU. End-of-life decisions to withhold or withdraw life support were taken on collectively when all participants were convinced that maintenance or increase of life-sustaining therapies was futile and that death would irremediably occur in a short-term manner.",

As soon as infection was recognized, patients were promptly treated with empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic combination, depending on the site of infection, known colonization and previous antibiotic treatment. Antifungal therapy was added if fungal infection was suspected or documented. Antimicrobial treatment was narrowed after identification of the responsible pathogen. In addition, source control measures, such as surgery or removal of infected catheters were applied when necessary. Hemodynamic management included fluid resuscitation combined with continuous infusion of vasoactive drugs (mostly norepinephrin, while associated cardiac dysfunction prompted the use of either a combination of norepinephrin and dobutamine or epinephrin). Terlipressin was not used in combination with other vasoactive drugs. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were performed in case of respiratory failure or coma. Renal replacement therapy (RRT), through either intermittent hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration was initiated in case of acute renal failure, severe metabolic acidosis, or other life-threatening metabolic disorders.",

Thus, patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were mechanically ventilated using a protective strategy with low tidal volume of 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight [13]. More generally, the plateau pressure was limited to 30 cm H2O in all ventilated patients. Intensive insulin therapy was used to maintain blood glucose between 4.4 and 8.1 mmol/L [14]. Low-dose corticosteroids (200 mg hydrocortisone per day) were administrated in vasopressor-dependent septic shock for 5 to 7 days [15]. Patients with at least two organ dysfunctions were considered for treatment with activated protein C in the absence of contraindication [16]. In order to assess whether these therapeutic advances resulted in improved survival in cirrhotic septic patients, we divided the whole cohort in two near-sized period groups, 1997-2004 (first period) and 2005-2010 (second period), in between the first guidelines of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign were published.",

Child-Pugh score was computed prior to the current acute complication whereas MELD score was computed on the first day in the ICU. We also collected the infection characteristics including microbiological and clinical documentation and adequacy of initial antibiotic regimen within the early 48 h following the onset of infection, the organ failures supports including type and volume of fluid loading, mechanical ventilation and RRT, as well as adjuvant treatments of sepsis (intensive insulin therapy, low-dose glucocorticoids and activated protein C). The Simplified Acute Physiology Score 2 (SAPS II) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score were calculated on the first day in the ICU [21,22]. Outcomes were in-ICU, in-hospital, and 6-month survival rates. Vital status was assessed using the medical records or the administrative hospital database.

Multiple mechanisms concur to confer an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections and subsequently to multiple organ failure in cirrhotic patients. Bacterial translocation increases with the severity of liver disease and represents the main mechanism of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Furthermore, it may sustain the septic process in every type of infection as suggested by the increased levels of endotoxin observed in cirrhotic patients [26]. In addition, innate immune cells display functional abnormalities such as increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS [27] or alcohol-induced defective phagocytosis [28].

Although the true benefit of some of these interventions have been addressed by additional studies, they have been included in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines [8]. This international guideline-based performance improvement program promoted early recognition and management of sepsis and showed that increased compliance with the guidelines was associated with an improved survival rate [31]. In the same way, a continuous decrease in the mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock patients has been reported in large unselected cohorts that mostly comprised non-cirrhotic patients [1,32,33].

            "text": "Differences in survival between the two periods occurred early in the course of the disorder and were thereafter maintained. The rate of inadequate antibiotic treatment was low and similar between both periods. Most patients received an initial combination antimicrobial treatment of \u03b2-lactam associated with either aminoglycosides or fluoroquinolones. An initial single dose of aminoglycosides was commonly subsequently replaced by fluoroquinolones to limit harmful side-effects. Indeed, some retrospective studies suggest a benefit of combination antibiotherapy, most especially of betalactams and aminoglycosides, for septic shock in general cohorts as well as in cirrhotic patients [7,34]. Survival improvement was more likely related to changes in the early management of shock and organ failures. With respect to fluid resuscitation strategies, the majority of patients from the recent period received albumin and consequently received less crystalloids. Albumin resuscitation was associated with higher Child-Pugh and MELD scores (P = 0.04 and P = 0.03 respectively, data not shown), suggesting that albumin was preferentially indicated to patients with advanced stages of cirrhosis. The role of albumin resuscitation in sepsis remains challenging. A meta-analysis suggested that fluid resuscitation with albumin compared to crystalloids was associated with improved survival in patients with severe sepsis [35]. Specifically, albumin resuscitation has been shown to reduce mortality and renal impairment in cirrhotic patients treated for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis [36]. Accordingly, frequent albumin resuscitation in the recent period of our study was also associated with less frequent recourse to renal replacement therapy. Altogether, these results and ours suggest a possible benefit of albumin resuscitation in cirrhotic patients with severe sepsis, that remains to be prospectively investigated. The frequent use of low-dose corticosteroids was also a hallmark of sepsis management during the second period. Indeed, adrenal dysfunction frequently occurs in patients with septic shock and is associated with hemodynamic instability, renal dysfunction, and increased mortality [37]. However, the use of low-dose corticosteroids in septic shock remains controversial because of discrepant efficacy data and a possible higher risk of nosocomial infections [15]. Of note, this treatment has been specifically addressed in cirrhotic patients with septic shock. In a case-control study, resolution of shock and survival were higher in hydrocortisone-treated cirrhotic patients [38]. However a randomized controlled trial in septic shock cirrhotic patients was stopped for futility at interim analysis because hydrocortisone did not reduce mortality and was associated with an increase in adverse effects such as shock relapse and gastrointestinal bleeding [39]. In addition to sepsis-specific therapies, general measures for ICU patients such as ventilation with low tidal volumes and glucose control with intravenous insulin therapy were also routinely implemented during the second period.",

            "text": "Cirrhotic patients are commonly perceived as poor candidates for ICU admission because of the very high mortality rates associated with organ failures [40,41]. A general improvement in outcome for cirrhotic patients in the ICU has been recently reported regardless of the type of acute complication [42,43]. Several factors may explain this progress, including a better selection of patients on the basis of previous functional status and advances in the management of acute complications such as variceal bleeding [44], hepatorenal syndrome [45], or septic shock as highlighted in the present study. The extent of organ failures clearly represents a major determinant of outcome, and the performance of SOFA score that nearly reached significance in our multivariate model is in accordance with previous studies [6,46]. Most importantly, we also identified the stage of the underlying liver disease assessed by the Child-Pugh score as an independent prognostic factor of septic shock. Until now, the discrimination of the Child-Pugh score calculated at the time of ICU admission had remained inferior to organ failure scores [6,46,47]. As a matter of fact, we computed Child-Pugh score prior to the acute complication in order to reliably assess the stage of liver disease without any interference from new-onset organ failures. This finding carries major practical implications for the decision-making process. Indeed, this could allow a better selection of patients likely to benefit from intensive care, on the basis of underlying disease's status and realistic therapeutic options including liver transplantation. Nevertheless, an accurate individual prognosis prediction of cirrhotic patients is often difficult at the time of ICU admission, but can be markedly refined after a few days [6,46]. In the light of improved outcomes and limited performance of initial prognostic prediction, critically-ill cirrhotic patients with a reasonable long-term prognosis should be offered a broad intensive care access policy with subsequent reappraisal based on the nature of the acute complication and the evolution of organ failures.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations that we acknowledge. First, the design was retrospective despite most data were prospectively collected through computerized patient data management system. Therefore, we can only report an association between changes in care and patient outcome over the study period. Second, it was carried out in a single center, with a hepatology unit that is closely involved in the decision-making process and in the management of critically ill cirrhotic patients while in the ICU and after discharge. Third, the limited number of patients may limit the external validity of our findings. However, our survival rates in the latter period are similar to those reported by Arabi et al. (hospital survival 24%) [7] and Levesque et al. (ICU survival 36%) [6]. Fourth, indications for ICU admission or end-of-life decisions might have evolved over the study period, and we cannot exclude that patients from the recent period were more carefully selected or referred earlier to the ICU. Nevertheless, the functional status, the stage of the underlying liver disease and the severity scores were similar between both periods. In addition, arterial blood lactate level as an indicator of prolonged systemic hypoperfusion also suggested similar duration and severity of shock before ICU admission. Altogether, these results suggest that improvements in survival were more likely related to changes in care. Fourth, we failed to link the recent improvement in survival with a single therapeutic change, suggesting that it is more likely related to a combination of interventions. Alternatively, some unrecognized or non-collected data might also influence the outcome. For instance, the functional status assessed by the performance status prior to the acute complication is a major prognostic factor in critically-ill cancer patients [48], and might be more accurate than the Knaus scale in this setting. In the same way, the nutritional status might also be of importance in these patients [49].",
