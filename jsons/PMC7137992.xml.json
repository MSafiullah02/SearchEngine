CDC staff work with peers in Ministries of Health and other host country entities to implement effective national programmes in HIV care and treatment, tuberculosis\u2013HIV integration, maternal and child health, HIV prevention, and HIV counselling and testing. Through PEPFAR, CDC is also strengthening public health systems through focused investments in local workforce capacity and health systems that are essential to the scale-up and sustainability of priority PEPFAR programmes and to the strengthening of the broader public health system. For example, growing HIV treatment programmes were shown to be positively correlated with increased rates of facility deliveries by non-HIV infected women.2\n",

President Obama announced in December, 2011, ambitious new targets for priority evidence-based interventions that were to be realised in just 2 years' time: PEPFAR, in 2013, was committed to directly support 6 million patients receiving treatment, an increase of 50% over the previous target; provision of therapy to 1\u00b75 million pregnant women to prevent vertical infection of HIV; and to cumulatively reach 4\u00b77 million men with voluntary medical male circumcisions.3, 4 CDC and its partners worked to make these bold targets a reality. PEPFAR has directly supported 6\u00b77 million patients receiving treatment; provided more than 1\u00b75 million pregnant women with antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV during the preceding 2 years; and with cumulative support of 4\u00b72 million medical male circumcisions, was on track to achieve that target by the end of 2013.5\n",

Option B+ not only reduces mother-to-child transmission to less than 5% but also maintains the mother's health, provides lifelong reduction of HIV transmission to uninfected sexual partners, and prevents mother-to-child transmission in future pregnancies. Other African and Caribbean countries are now initiating this approach. Although each country must weigh the potential effect and costs of Option B+ in reaching the goal of elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission, this approach could overcome barriers such as inadequate immunological testing capacity, substantial distances between antenatal clinic and ART-initiation sites, and human resource constraints.6\n",

With PEPFAR's reauthorisation in 2008, CDC worked to further strengthen programme sustainability, country stewardship, and local implementation of core programmes. CDC worked with Ministries of Health to transition service delivery of HIV/AIDS care and treatment to local stewardship in 13 countries. As of February, 2012, these countries had contracts or awards in place with indigenous partners to establish local country ownership of their ART programmes. The transition of treatment programmes to indigenous partners is consistent with CDC's approach across programme areas of working through partner Ministries of Health and other local entities. 61% of CDC's PEPFAR programme funding goes through indigenous entities, and this share should continue to grow as CDC provides the technical support and capacity building to maintain continuity and quality of treatment services.",

The virus is of low pathogenicity in poultry, and subclinical avian infection has complicated animal control efforts. Although no sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred, it is too early to be certain of the full effect that this novel virus will have on human or animal populations.

The US Government committed more than US$3 billion in new funds for post-earthquake relief, recovery, and reconstruction; facilitated MSPP's rapid detection of Vibrio cholerae within days of its introduction; and contributed to an effective emergency response20 to the worst national cholera epidemic in the modern era.25 After these back-to-back crises, in early 2011 MSPP, CDC, and other organisations identified seven measurable public health effect goals to transform health services and disease outcomes.26\n",
