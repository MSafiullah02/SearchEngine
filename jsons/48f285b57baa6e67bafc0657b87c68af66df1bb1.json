Infants infected with SARS-CoV-2 are more severely affected than are older children. Compared with older age groups, higher proportions of children under 1 year of age are hospitalised (62%) and admitted to intensive care (5%). 4 There is currently a paucity of detailed data on neonates and premature infants infected with SARS-CoV-2. Reports of infection in neonates born to mothers with active infection have generally shown a mild clinical course. 5, 6 The infant described in this report was severely unwell at presentation. Evidence of renal, liver, and bone marrow dysfunction during the early stages of admission (and rapid recovery) were probably a reflection of the shocked state in which the infant presented, rather than the effect of the virus itself or thromboembolic disease. Notably, despite recovery of marrow function, lymphopenia persisted-a frequently reported observation in adult COVID-19. We cannot rule out the possibility of a bacterial co-infection contributing to disease severity. However, within the context of the disease progression and the results of thorough microbiological investigation, S epidermidis (cultured from a blood sample taken at admission) was considered to be unlikely to be a diseasecausing pathogen. The deterioration in respiratory function over the first week and progressive X-ray changes consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome are similar to the findings in severely affected adults. The institution of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide on day 8 of admission probably improved the ventilation-perfusion mismatch, somewhat relieving the hypoxaemia. Similar adult treatment strategies have involved continuous inhaled epoprostenol to achieve vasodilation in ventilated areas of the lung. It is unclear to what extent ventilating in the prone position was of benefit, as there was temporal overlap of this manoeuvre with the modifications in ventilation described above. We cannot rule out the possibility of pulmonary thrombi (commonly identified in adult disease) contributing to the deterioration, because no CT scan was done.",

At the point of respiratory deterioration, our patient's blood IL6 concentration was high (113 pg/mL [normal range <6\u00b73 pg/mL]). In an adult cohort in Germany, the risk of respiratory failure was 22 times greater in adults with an IL6 concentration of >80 pg/mL compared with those with lower IL6 concentrations. 8 Respiratory improvement in this infant appeared to be associated with a decrease in IL6 concentration, ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase, rather than a decrease in viral load, suggesting that the host pulmonary inflammatory response might have been important with regard to respiratory failure. At the point of respiratory deterioration, remdesivir was also prescribed. Remdesivir is a prodrug of a nucleotide analogue that inhibits viral RNA polymerases, and in-vitro testing has shown activity against SARS-CoV-2. 9 Outcomes of an adult cohort with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir have recently been published, although viral load in these patients was not reported. 10 The stable viral load in our patient does not suggest that remdesivir was important in the clinical improvement of this infant. No side-effects from remdesivir were apparent at the time of writing. SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe disease in infants, resulting in multiple organ injury. The severity of respiratory disease might be related to the host inflammatory response, as seen in adults with COVID-19. Detailed monitoring of the inflammation is recommended in paediatric severe disease, modulation of which might represent a potential avenue of treatment.",
