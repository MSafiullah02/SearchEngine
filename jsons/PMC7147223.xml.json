Whilst the majority of effort is aimed at infection, there is also need for clinical research on how to best manage seriously ill patients with COVID-19 [1]. Current available therapies - including non-specific anti-virals, antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections and sepsis, and corticosteroids to reduce inflammation - fail in severe disease where the hallmark is the cytokine storm induced by COVID-19 in the lung, visible as inflammatory lesions with ground-glass opacity on CT scan. Virally-triggered acute cytokine release of IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A and TNF\u03b1 induces pulmonary oedema, dysfunction of air-exchange, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, and often secondary infection, leading to death.",

For COVID-19, the case fatality rate (CFR) remains unknown until the number infected is determined, but WHO estimates 0.3\u20131%, which is higher than 0.1% for influenza A. The accruing epidemiological analyses, linked with country-based mitigation strategies, and with estimates that about 80% COVID-19 patients have mild or asymptomatic disease, 14% severe disease, and 6% critically ill, underpin a continuing need for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia in the long term.",

Using nanotechnology synthetic stem cells are available as \u201cLIFNano\u201d with 1000 times increase in potency compared to soluble LIF [7]. In EAE, a preclinical model of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), treatment with LIFNano treversed paralysis within 4 days (Fig. 2\n), a time line in accord with that reported for beneficial effects in COVID-19 pneumonia using MSC therapy. Previous studies using neural stem cells (NSC) to treat EAE showed benefits that were solely dependent on NSC-derived LIF [reviewed in 7]. As an emerging alternative to cell-based therapy, such as LIFNano meet the need for a high volume and off-the-shelf therapeutic agents able to rejuvenate damaged tissues and suppress cytokine storm in pneumonia.

Previous Studies had shown that LIF is particularly important for the epithelial STAT3 activating capacity of pneumonic alveolar lining, and that treatment with exogenous LIF [9] or LIF over-expression [10] can limit pulmonary inflammation in response to LPS or hyperoxia. The Quinton experiment illustrated here investigates the requirement for endogenous LIF to protect against acute lung injury. Lungs were collected from mice 24 h after intratracheal inoculation of Escherichia coli co-instilled with anti-LIF or control IgG.
