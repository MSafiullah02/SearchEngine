Launching of the malaria elimination programme in the GMS has led to a steady decline of malaria burden in the GMS in recent years [2]. However, this ambitious plan encounters multiple challenges such as antimalarial multidrug resistance, cross-border population mobility and parasite introduction, and asymptomatic Plasmodium infections as the reservoir for malaria transmission [3\u20136]. In addition, Plasmodium vivax has become the predominant parasite in the GMS, and its proportion has been increasing [7]. Thus, new and integrated intervention strategies to reduce malaria transmission are needed. Among them, transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs) are considered an integral component of the measures for malaria control and elimination [8\u201311].",

            "text": "Gametocytes developed in the human host are the obligative stage for the transmission to mosquitoes [12]. After a mosquito takes an infected blood meal, male and female gametocytes are activated in the mosquito midgut to develop into gametes. Fertilization between a microgamete and a macrogamete produces a zygote, which then transforms into a mobile ookinete. The ookinete traverses the mosquito midgut wall and starts sporogonic development in the mosquito. Although the molecular mechanisms of fertilization are poorly understood, this process is a promising target for the interruption of transmission [13]. Several proteins involved in the fertilization process have been identified, including P47, P48/45, P230 and HAP2 [14, 15]. HAP2/Generative Cell Specific 1 (GCS1), first identified in the plants Arabidopsis thaliana and Lilium longflorum, is a class II viral fusion protein with a cysteine-rich extracellular region [16\u201318]. HAP2/GCS1 is highly conserved in a wide range of species, such as the green alga Chlamydomonas and Plasmodium [19]. The N-terminus of this protein interacts with proteins expressed on the female gamete, whereas the C-terminus interacts with sperm plasma membrane during fertilization [20]. In Plasmodium, HAP2 protein is located specifically on the surface of activated male gametes [18, 19]. It is an essential component for gamete fusion, since hap2 gene knockout in the rodent parasite P. berghei abolishes fertilization [19, 21]. Recent studies identified a conserved \u2018cd loop\u2019 segment within the HAP2/GCS1 protein, corresponding to amino acids (aa) 174\u2013205 in PbHAP2 and aa 178\u2013207 in P. falciparum HAP2, which is critical for membrane fusion during fertilization [16, 22, 23]. Antibodies raised against \u2018cd loop\u2019 segment of both PbHAP2 and PfHAP2 protein showed evident transmission reduction activity (TRA) in mosquito feeding assays [21, 24]. Meanwhile, like other surface-located vaccine candidate antigens, naturally acquired antibodies against HAP2 are detected in malaria exposed individuals [24]. Altogether, these results suggest that HAP2 is a promising TBV candidate.",

Primers for pvhap2 gene amplification were designed using the pvhap2 sequence (PlasmoDB ID: PVX_094925), located on chromosome 8 at nucleotides 651,355 to 654,032 of the P. vivax Salvador-I (Sal I) reference strain (Additional file 2: Table S1). The pvhap2 sequence corresponding to nucleotides 13\u20132574 (aa 5\u2013858) was amplified by PCR using the primer pair pvsHap2-1F and pvsHap2-1R for the primary PCR, and the primer pair pvsHap2-nest-F and pvsHap2-nest-R for the nested PCR. Primary and nested PCR was conducted in a reaction volume of 20 \u03bcl including 1\u00d7 KOD-Plus-Neo buffer (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), 200 \u03bcM dNTPs (Toyobo), 1 mM MgSO4 (Toyobo), 10 \u00b5M of each primer, 1 \u03bcl of gDNA or primary PCR product (1:1000 dilution), and 0.4 units of KOD-Plus-Neo DNA polymerase (Toyobo). The cycling conditions for both primary and nested PCR were as follows: one step at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min; 39 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 15 s, and 68 \u00b0C for 1 min; and an extension step at 68 \u00b0C for 5 min. The PCR products were separated in 1.5% agarose gel in the presence of SYBRTM Safe DNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and visualized under UV light. PCR fragments were purified with QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol and sequenced in both directions using primers listed in Additional file 2: Table S1 on a 3730XL DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, USA). To verify the sequencing accuracy, purified PCR products from two independent amplifications of each isolate were sequenced in both DNA strands. Sequencing results of samples with double peaks at one single site were considered as mixed infection and excluded from further analysis. All nucleotide singletons (substitutions appearing only once among the sequences) were re-sequenced from new PCR products for verification. The nucleotide sequences were deposited in the GenBank database under the accession numbers MT087312-MT087446 (China-Myanmar border), MT087488-MT087538 (Myanmar) and MT087447-MT087487 (Thailand). In addition, 52 pvhap2 sequences from Iranian P. vivax isolates (GenBank: KM594259-KM594288 and KU743361-KU743382) were included for comparison [26].",

Additionally, nucleotide diversity was also estimated on a sliding window of 90 bases with a step size of 3 bp implemented in DnaSP v6.10.01 [28]. Natural selection was determined by calculating the dN-dS difference using the Nei & Gojobori\u2019s method with the Jukes & Cantor correction as implemented in MEGA X, and significance was determined by a Z-test [27]. A positive value of dN-dS shows positive natural selection, whereas a negative value indicates purifying selection. The Tajima\u2019s D test [29], Fu & Li\u02bcs D* and F* tests [30] were performed using DnaSP v6.10.01 to determine departure from neutrality [28]. McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test [31] was performed using the Plasmodium cynomolgi hap2 gene (PlasmoDB ID: PcyM_0814900) as an outgroup [28]. Meanwhile, to detect selection acting on specific amino acids of the protein, codon-based test was performed by using HyPhy package implemented in the Data Monkey Web Server [32]. Fisher\u2019s exact test was applied to test for significant non-randomness (P < 0.05), and the skew from randomness was calculated as the neutrality index.",

Significant negative value of Tajima\u2019s D (\u2212 1.9897, P < 0.05) observed in Myanmar isolates indicated purifying or directional selection (Table 4). Although Tajima\u2019s D value was also below zero in the China-Myanmar border and Thailand populations, the tests showed no significant departure from neutrality (Table 4). In comparison, both Fu & Li\u2019s D* and F* tests identified significant deviation from zero in pvhap2 genes in the three populations, suggesting expansion in population size and/or purifying selection (Table 4). Consistent results were obtained with the McDonald-Kreitman\u2019s test using the P. cynomolgi hap2 gene as the outgroup, which showed an excess of synonymous substitutions within the pvhap2 sequences relative to synonymous substitutions from the outgroup species, albeit the result was significant only in China-Myanmar border population, suggesting functional constraint occurring at certain residues in this protein (Table 4).",

Previous reports have demonstrated the \u2018cd loop\u2019 region of HAP2 protein is essential for gamete fertilization [16]. Of note, two non-synonymous mutations (K129N and Y133S) were found within the loop region (108\u2013222 aa) of the Pvhap2 protein, which corresponds to the HAP2 orthologues in P. falciparum (178\u2013195 aa) and P. berghei (174\u2013191 aa).

Given the essential function of the \u201ccd loop\u201d in mediating membrane fusion, these results suggest that functional conservation of the same region within the HAP2 protein in P. vivax may limit the accumulation of amino acid mutations [16, 22].

Pairwise comparison showed considerable differentiation between China-Myanmar border and western Myanmar populations. Alternatively, this divergence may reflect an evolutionary trend of the parasite populations through time, as the parasites from western Thailand (83.0%), China-Myanmar border (68.3%) and western Myanmar (36.5%) were collected in 2011, 2016 and 2018, respectively. It is possible that this longitudinal decrease in D637N prevalence may be associated with host immunity since HAP2 is shown to be naturally immunogenic and antibodies against this protein are present in endemic populations [24]. Interestingly, codon-based selection tests detected positive selection at three codons in the western Myanmar parasites, including codon 637, suggesting potential targeting of these codons by host immunity. Of note, D637N is located in an epitope region (625\u2013651 aa) of the Pvhap2 protein; thus, this mutation may alter the immunogenicity of the HAP2 protein. Future experiments are needed to show whether this amino acid substitution could interfere with fusion function (gamete fusion) or protein recognition by host antibodies.",

            "text": "Pvhap2 showed lower genetic diversity (ranging from 0.00018 to 0.00075 for all global isolates analyzed) [26] compared to other sexual stage transmission-blocking antigens reported in P. vivax such as pvs28/25 (\u03c0 = 0.0034/0.0013, Yunnan Province of China, [43]; \u03c0 = 0.0041/0.0023, Myanmar, [44]), pvs48/45 (\u03c0 = 0.00173, global isolates, [45]), and pvs230 (\u03c0 = 0.00118, global isolates, [46]). This high level of conservation may be a consequence of the essential function of this protein in fertilization. Although not significant, the negative value for the dN-dS in nucleotide sequences of pvhap2 gene from the GMS suggests purifying selection may act on this gene. Allele-frequency-based tests further indicate that pvhap2 was influenced by purifying selection. Further, when zoomed in specific regions of the pvhap2 gene, codons under purifying selection were identified in all three GMS parasite populations. This is similar to the gametocyte/gamete-surface antigen pvs230, which appears to be under purifying selection [46]. Another gametocyte/gametes surface protein, pvs48/45, was found to be under positive selection [47]. Thus, in addition to functional constraints, Pvhap2 may avoid immune selection pressure from the human host, as it is predominantly expressed by microgametes found in mosquito midgut, not in humans. Regardless, the evolutionary conservation of pvhap2 may be beneficial for the design of a TBV.",

Within the GMS, however, low FST values among all GMS populations studied here may suggest extensive gene flow among these populations, possibly mediated or enhanced by migratory human populations [48]. These results also highlight that Pvhap2-based TBV design need to factor in the geographical differentiation of pvhap2 among populations. For example, GMS parasite populations did show a highly prevalent haplotype, H2 (frequency within the GMS area: 61.67%), whereas the Sal I Pvhap2 haplotype was not observed in Myanmar (0/51), and circulates with low frequency in the China-Myanmar border (1/135) and Thailand (3/41) isolates. Although the two non-synonymous positions (E317K and D637N) that are located in the predicted B cell epitopes did not seem to change the protein configuration and B cell epitope prediction score, this awaits further experimental confirmation.",
