They cause major economic loss, sometimes associated with high mortality, in neonates of some domestic species (e.g., chickens, pigs). In humans, they are responsible for respiratory and enteric diseases. Coronaviruses do not necessarily observe species barriers, as illustrated most graphically by the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus among wild animals and to man, with lethal consequences. As a group, coronaviruses are not limited to particular organs; target tissues include the nervous system, immune system, kidney, and reproductive tract in addition to many parts of the respiratory and enteric systems. A great advance in recent years has been the development of systems (\u2018infectious clones\u2019) for modifying the genomes of coronaviruses to study all aspects of coronavirus replication, and for the development of new vaccines.",

Coronavirus subgenomic mRNAs are generated by a discontinuous process. At the beginning of each gene is a common sequence (CUUAACAA in the case of IBV) called a transcription regulatory sequence (TRS). It is believed that when the polymerase producing the nascent negative sense RNA, reaches a TRS, RNA synthesis is attenuated, followed by continuation at the 5\u2032 end of genomic RNA. This results in the addition of a negative copy of the leader sequence to the negative-sense RNA, resulting in a negative-sense copy of an sg mRNA. Of course, progress of the polymerase is not always halted at a TRS. Rather, it sometimes continues, producing a nested set of negative-sense sg mRNAs. These are the templates for the generation of the positive-sense sg mRNAs (Figure 2). The amount of each sg mRNA does not necessarily decrease in a linear fashion; the efficiency of termination by a TRS is dependent on adjacent sequences, which are different for each gene. The leader sequence is found at the very 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA and at the 5\u2032 ends of each sg mRNA.",

These proteins are cleaved by ORF1a-encoded proteases, after which they become part of replicase complexes for the synthesis of either complete negative-sense copies of the genomic RNA or negative-sense copies of the sg mRNAs. The negative-sense RNAs are used as templates for the synthesis of genomic RNA and sg mRNAs (Figure 2). Following synthesis of the sg mRNAs, the structural proteins are produced for the assembly and encapsidation of the de novo-synthesized genomic RNA, resulting in the release of new infectious coronavirus virions. The release of new virions starts 3\u20134 h after the initial infection. As indicated above, the synthesis of the sg mRNAs is the result of a discontinuous process in which the synthesis of a negative-sense copy of an sg mRNA is completed by the addition of the negative-sense leader sequence by a recombination mechanism. If a cell is infected with two related coronaviruses, the polymerase may swap between two RNA templates, in a similar way to addition of the leader sequence. This \u2018copy-choice\u2019 mechanism of genetic recombination results in a chimeric RNA. Such RNAs may give rise to new viruses with modified genomes with a capacity to infect a different cell and, in some cases, new host species.",

However, other proteins can also affect pathogenicity. Research with genetically modified coronaviruses, using targeted recombination or \u2018infectious clones\u2019, has shown that modifications to proteins encoded in ORF1 and the small genes interspersed among the structural protein genes, result in attenuation of pathogenicity. Although the roles of these \u2018accessory proteins\u2019 are not known, this may offer a route to the development of a new generation of live vaccines. Currently, the most widely used prophylactics for control of IBV in chickens include killed vaccines and live vaccines attenuated by passage in embryonated eggs.

The upper part of the diagram shows the IBV genomic RNA, with the various genes highlighted as boxed regions. The black boxes represent the transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) found upstream of each gene and direct the synthesis, via negative-sense counterparts, of the sg mRNAs (2\u20136 for IBV). The leader sequence, represented by a gray box, is at the 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA and at the 5\u2032 ends of the sg mRNAs. The genomic RNA is translated to produce two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, that are cleaved by virus-encoded proteases to produce the replicase proteins. The structural proteins, S, E, M, and E, and the accessory proteins, 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b, produced from IBV genes 3 and 5, respectively, are translated from the sg mRNAs. The proteins produced by the sg mRNAs are represented by lines below the corresponding sg mRNA. All of the sg mRNAs, except the smallest species, are polycistronic but only produce a protein from the 5\u2032-most gene. The ribosome frameshift (RFS) region, denoted as a black circle on the genomic RNA, directs the \u20131 frameshift event for the synthesis of pp1ab. Translation of the genomic RNA results in the production of pp1a. However, the translating ribosomes undergo the \u20131 frameshift about 30% of the time resulting in pp1ab. The 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR sequences are represented as single lines downstream of the leader and N gene sequences, respectively.",

Translation of the coronavirus replicase ORF 1a and ORF 1b sequences results in pp1a and pp1ab; the latter is a C-terminal extension of pp1a, following a programmed \u20131 frameshift event (see legend to Figure 2). The two polyproteins are proteolytically cleaved into 10 (pp1a; nsp1\u201311) and 16 (pp1ab; nsp1\u201316) products by the papain-like proteinases (PL1pro and PL2pro) and the 3C-like (3CLpro) proteinase. The PLpro proteinases cleave at the sites indicated with a black triangle and the 3CLpro proteinase cleaves at the sites indicated with a gray triangle. The nsp11 product of pp1a is produced as a result of the ribosomes terminating at the ORF 1a translational termination codon, a \u20131 frameshift results in the generation of nsp12, part of the pp1ab replicase gene product. Various domains have been identified within some of the replicase products: Ac is a conserved acidic domain; X = ADP-ribose 1\u2032-phosphatase (ADRP) domain; PL1 and PL2 the two papain-like proteinases; Y is a conserved domain; TM1, TM2, and TM3 are conserved putative transmembrane domains; 3CL = 3CLpro domain; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain; HEL, helicase domain; ExoN, exonuclease domain; NendoU, uridylate-specific endoribonuclease domain; MT, 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase domain. nsp's 7\u20139 contain RNA-binding domains (RBDs).",
