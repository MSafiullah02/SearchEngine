            "text": "Viral respiratory infections are transmitted from person to person. Many of the viruses that cause them are carried asymptomatically in the nasopharynx1 and symptoms may not show until several days later. Although these diseases are mild in most cases, newborns, and especially those born preterm or with low birth weight, are at high risk of respiratory tract infection with severe symptoms such as respiratory distress, apnoea or haemodynamic instability. These symptoms often cannot be distinguished from symptoms caused by bacterial infections or other diseases associated to prematurity, such as enterocolitis, nosocomial sepsis or apnoea of prematurity, so respiratory viruses are not the only causative agents under consideration. Yet, we know that common viral respiratory tract infections, such as infection by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), cause considerable morbidity and mortality in preterm patients as well as severe disease outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).2, 3 In addition to classical viruses like RSV and influenza viruses, rhinovirus (RV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronavirus (CoV) and human bocavirus (hBoV) play an increasingly important role in respiratory tract infections in infants. Very little is known about their role in neonatal units,4, 5 although we have demonstrated that they are associated with relevant pathology in our unit.6, 7\n",

In this prospective study, which had a design similar to ours, Bennett et al.13 observed that 52% of the 60 preterm neonates tested for viral detection had positive results during their stay. This group of neonates had longer lengths of stay, prolonged respiratory support, and a higher incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In our patients, the proportion of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was also greater in infants in whom a virus had been detected, but the group of children that tested negative for viruses had a greater gestational age, a circumstance that may lead to misinterpretation of the results. The proportions of the viruses detected by Bennett et al. differed somewhat from ours, with a high prevalence of RSV, parainfluenza virus and hMPV, especially in the winter. Rhinovirus was detected in only 27% of the patients. The lower incidence of viral infections by RSV or influenza in our group may have been due to our meticulous adherence to the preventive measures against nosocomial infections.",

Viral respiratory infections should be ruled out in infants with rhinorrhoea, apnoea, high oxygen requirements and clinical suspicion of sepsis. We must apply rigorous measures for infection prevention and possibly introduce additional hygiene measures.",
