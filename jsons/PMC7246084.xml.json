            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has been responsible for more than one million infections and thousands of deaths worldwide [1, 2]. In the USA, testing remains limited and at a premium. Criteria for testing even at many tertiary academic centers remain reserved for those with lower respiratory infection symptoms and a known primary exposure to a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 patient or travel to a high-risk area [3]. Despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) releasing an immediate statement that community spread (i.e., infection without relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient) has been present since February, 2020; testing has not expanded significantly to include communally affected patients [4]. Furthermore, many patients who are RT-PCR-positive for COVID-19 remain minimally symptomatic and can transmit the virus without prolonged close contact with other individuals [5]. Together, data suggest that by limiting lab testing to only those with lower respiratory symptoms and a known exposure increases risk to unsuspecting health care workers without personal protective equipment (PPE), results in nosocomial transmission, continued propagation in the community, and potentially delay in care. Indeed, reports now indicate high rates of hospital spread, both to healthcare workers and hospitalized patients, many of which are in the group at highest risk of mortality [6].",

Early in the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, insufficient test kits and poor PCR sensitivity resulted in a role of computer tomography (CT) imaging for disease detection [7, 8]. Many studies from this cohort have established a high sensitivity (up to 97%) in the diagnosis of COVID-19. While major concerns arose from the low reported specificity of CT (25%), recent studies have suggested that radiologists with experience or artificial intelligence may be able to distinguish COVID-19 from other pneumonias with up to 80\u201390% accuracy [9, 10].",

No patients presented with known contact to an RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patient, and no patients endorsed recent international travel to a high-level region. Seven out of eight patients were found to be COVID-19 RT-PCR positive, with one patient diagnosed with influenza A. The mean age among PCR-positive patients was 65 years (SD 8.9, range 54\u201380). At the time of presentation, no patients presented with fever, and the mean maximum recorded temperature was 36.7 \u00b0C (range 36.2\u201337.6 \u00b0C). One patient presented with hypertension; otherwise, no other vital sign derangements including abnormal respiratory rate or oxygen saturation were present at the time of initial triage. Six patients received CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis, with findings suspicious for COVID-19 identified at the lung bases (Fig. 1). Of these six patients, three patients presented with subjective fevers, low energy, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, and the CT was obtained to evaluate for intra-abdominal pathology. A fourth patient presented with abdominal distention and acute kidney injury in the setting of chemotherapy, and a stone-protocol CT scan was ordered to evaluate for obstruction and hydronephrosis. A sixth patient was recently post-operative from an iliac bypass surgery and presented with anemia. The seventh patient presented with colostomy stoma prolapse and leg swelling and was known to have recent influenza infection; this was the only patient found to be COVID-19 RT-PCR negative. The possibility of COVID-19 infection was raised on chest radiograph in two patients (Fig. 2). Both of these patients presented with subjective fevers, low energy, and diarrhea.",

The cohort presented herein, along with many other published studies, show that this testing strategy may be overly restrictive as there is a significant rate of communal and sub-clinical spread [4, 5, 12\u201315]. It is well documented that many patients who are RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 may have an incubation period of 5 days and can transmit the virus without prolonged close contact with other individuals [5, 12]. Here, we show in seven patients without lower respiratory symptoms, documented fever, or known exposure that COVID-19 infection can not only be present, but subsequently result in high rates of intubation and mortality. Many centers do not incorporate imaging in their RT-PCR algorithms and there remains diagnostic uncertainty regarding patients with imaging consistent with COVID-19 but are otherwise of low clinical suspicion. We argue that patients with suspicious imaging findings, especially CT, even in the low-incidence and low clinical suspicion setting shown here, warrants prompt RT-PCR testing. Additionally, as detection of these patients is difficult, data support the institution of widespread quarantine protocols to contain disease propagation.",

The lab-confirmed disease incidence at the time of this report remained low, with only 30 lab-confirmed infections and nine in-hospital infections. Despite this, imaging was able to incidentally identify patients with suspected COVID-19 findings, ultimately resulting in seven additional diagnoses and prompt initiation of PPE and quarantine protocols. This suggests that even in the early stages of community spread, there may be a high rate of undetected disease and a much-higher-than-suspected population incidence than that established by RT-PCR, which has been suggested by other studies [13\u201315]. This is in part due to restrictive testing criteria, which would have excluded these patients without pulmonary symptoms. These patients present a unique risk to those at the point-of-care, as there is low suspicion for COVID-19 at presentation, and therefore, the appropriate PPE precautions are not taken. Had these incidental imaging findings not been identified and correctly reported, or if these patients were not subsequently tested despite the reporting of suspicious imaging findings, these individuals may have continued to spread the infection to healthcare workers and within the community. This is highlighted by the two patients in this cohort who never developed symptoms who would have been sent home with a presumed negative COVID-19 diagnosis.",

Six out of seven (86%) of patients presented with abdominal complaints, consistent with an in-press publication suggesting nearly half of the patients in Hubei province of China endorsed gastrointestinal symptoms and that these patients had a more severe course of illness [16]. Classic pulmonary imaging findings in the absence of respiratory flu-like symptoms may increase the specificity for COVID-19 infection as the incidence of differential considerations (such as other respiratory viruses) is lower in this clinical context. COVID-19 in contrast is known to have an asymptomatic or sub-clinical period with positive chest CT findings [17]. Together, this may explain the high reported specificity of 88% in this small cohort of patients. Elevated inflammatory markers may be an important clinical correlate suggestive of a brewing COVID-19 infection, especially in the setting of leukopenia or a normal white blood cell count. Previous studies have shown that D-Dimer at the time of presentation may predict disease severity, which is concordant in this small cohort, with a markedly elevated D-Dimer range of 1396\u20133140 ng/mL among four patients, all of whom required eventual intubation and one of which expired during the admission [18]. These findings suggest that expansion of clinical suspicion beyond lower respiratory symptoms and exposure may be important to identify a larger proportion of infected patients and for appropriate triage and PPE at the point-of-care.",

Unlike other viral pneumonias which primarily affect the airway resulting in tree-in-bud nonduality in a bronchial distribution, COVID-19 affects the Type II pneumocyte and results in a unique CT appearance that lends increased specificity [21]. Emerging literature has shown that the initially reported rates of sensitivity may have been underestimated, with experienced radiologists and artificial intelligence successfully distinguishing COVID-19 from other pneumonias in upwards of 80% of the cases [9, 10]. In a recent study of over 1000 patients, CT resulted in higher sensitivity in detection of SARS-COV2 as compared with initial RT-PCR from pharyngeal swab samples [22]. Reported positive predictive values were upwards of 60%. Additional studies are emerging that further solidify this positive predictive value, with reports now uncovering a cohort of patients with high-suspicion CT and false-negative initial PCRs later discovered to have positive, concordant COVID-19-positive PCR [23, 24]. It remains to be seen how patients with positive cross-sectional imaging in the setting of high clinical suspicion, especially in the absence of other etiologies (for example, negative respiratory viral panel), should be managed, until higher rates of RT-PCR sensitivity and specificity are confirmed.",
