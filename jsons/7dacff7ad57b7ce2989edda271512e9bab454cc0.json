            "text": "We read with great interest the article by Norsa et al. about the outcome of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients during the COVID-19 outbreak in northern Italy.(1) From a total of 522 IBD patients followed in the unit in Bergamo (22% under use of immunomodulators or steroids and 16% with biologics), there were no reported cases of COVID-19 infection after a follow-up period of approximately 1 month, with no treatment modification or interruption. IBD patients are often being treated with immunomodulators and/or biological agents, which reduce systemic immunity and can possibly increase exposure for viral infections. Therefore, the daily management of IBD patients can also be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, as measures towards improved safety and reduced risk of contamination can be undertaken.(2) Any diagnostic or therapeutic intervention in the COVID-19 era can have consequences for IBD patients. Social isolation, especially for IBD patients, which was undertaken in several countries across the globe, aimed to reduce personal travelling and dislocation. Patients in rural areas have to travel to infusion clinics in order to keep therapy. Outpatient visits are usually limited to emergency situations, and the overspread use of telemedicine in stable patients was a natural consequence of this whole process. Additionally, the interruption of biological therapy, or the switching of intravenous to subcutaneous agents, which are not suggested by IBD experts, aims to keep patients at home and avoid infusion clinic visits. These measures can reduce the risk of contamination of COVID-19 but can also increase the risk of an IBD flare with all related consequences. Reorganization of IBD units around the globe needs to be undertaken to face this new reality.(2,3) Other measures such as delaying the initiation of biological therapy were also speculated in social media and expert discussions. This could theoretically reduce the risk of viral infections, but could also increase the risk of disease progression.(4) Delaying disease monitoring, with colonoscopies or fecal calprotectin, could also increase the possibility of relapse, as a disconnection of IBD-related symptoms and objective parameters is notable in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Delaying elective surgical procedures, aiming a reduction in the exposition of patients in a possibly contaminated environment, can also lead to disease complications such as the development of stenosis or perforation.(5) Figure 1 illustrates several interventions in IBD management during the COVID-19 era, which may have positive and negative consequences for IBD patients. Even though decisions in terms of medical therapy could reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection, these measures could also increase the risk of an IBD flare and disease progression. The same is true for surgical procedures, as patients submitted to elective procedures can have increased risk of severe COVID-19-related complications.(6) IBD therapeutic interventions and possible negative and positive consequences during the COVID-19 era. In the COVID-19 era, the prognosis of IBD patients can be significantly influenced by therapeutic interventions. The findings from the article by Norsa et al. show that keeping medical therapy in IBD patients can be a safe strategy, despite the short follow-up period of the study.(1) There is a clear need for an individualized approach of IBD interventions in this difficult moment of COVID-19 global pandemic infection.(2) Our generation of IBD physicians is learning how to balance difficult decisions at the epicenter of the problem. Involving patients in shared decision making can improve the possibilities of having no negative consequences during this difficult moment of mankind.",
