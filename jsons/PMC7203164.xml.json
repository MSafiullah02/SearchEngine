Actions, thus, are taken to prepare for disasters and mitigate their impact by reducing the likelihood of crisis and the magnitude of impacts on society. Preparedness ensures that a degree of thought and resources are dedicated to generating the knowledge and materials needed for response to and recovery from actualized disasters. Once a disaster occurs, the diverse disaster risk management community, including emergency managers, emergency services, public officials, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and others, act to address the immediate threats to life and property while beginning the process by which longer-term resumption of societal functioning may begin. In all societies, there exist more hazards than resources to mitigate them, resulting in the need to establish social acceptance of nonzero risk (as guided by the financial, social, physical, and other costs that individuals are unwilling to accept in exchange for any additional risk reduction benefits). Risk acceptability does change over time as understanding about individual risk increases and/or the different costs associated with disaster risk management options improve.",

As we increase our understanding of the relative risk of COVID-19 infection among different groups, individuals in those groups will begin to question their own necessity to remain in lockdown. Those tasked with managing the disaster will begin to question whether the cost of having a blunt lockdown approach, as it applies across all of society, is necessary or acceptable, given the risk reduction gained versus the extensive cost to the economy.",

The second goal is to maintain a sufficiently low rate of infection such that the most vulnerable populations are less likely to become exposed. Over two-thirds of those who become infected show no symptoms, and many more have only mild ones; however, for vulnerable populations, the disease represents a significant risk of mortality to themselves or to their elderly relatives.",

The definition of risk is \u201cthe effect of uncertainty on objectives,\u201d15 and community objectives are diverse and include social and emotional health, education, prosperity, liberty, and many other things that are negatively impacted by ongoing COVID-19 mitigation measures. Management of risk, therefore, needs to address all community objectives, applying different requirements for different populations. A community does not, for instance, apply flood prevention requirements for all homes in a community because a part of that community lies in the floodplain. Once the extent of that floodplain, or any risk measure, is known, management options improve dramatically. It is vital to begin applying a risk management approach to the COVID-19 response and recovery.",

If this continues to be effective for the next 14 days, the school could then resume activities. Another option that could be applied is the Taiwan \u201c7-2-7\u201d model.32 If 2 students in 1 class are infected within 7 days, the class is suspended for 7 days.32 Throughout this process there would need to be constant monitoring, and if the cases increase and/or hospital capacity reduces, the protective measures could be incrementally introduced.",

However, hourly and blue-collar workers are more vulnerable as they usually lack access to telework options. This increases their need to return to work, and if not supported in the safest possible manner, could put them and society at greater risk.

Major crises of any duration, scope, and intensity challenge leadership capacity, and the COVID-19 pandemic is perhaps the greatest crisis of our time. Decision-makers face the difficult task of transitioning the nation, states, municipalities, and organizations out of protective measures and into longer-term recovery. For this crisis, such efforts are most challenging given the potential recriminations, accusations, and fallout that can result from unexpected outcomes. Leaders that use a well-considered framework with an incremental approach to easing restrictions will be able to gradually restart the function of society within their jurisdiction while simultaneously maintaining most public health benefits achieved through current lockdown measures.
