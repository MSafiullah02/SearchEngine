            "text": "Understanding factors responsible for reemergence of diseases believed to have been controlled and outbreaks of previously unknown infectious diseases is one of the most difficult scientific problems facing society today. Significant knowledge gaps exist for even the most studied emerging infectious diseases. Coupled with failures in the response to the resurgence of infectious diseases, this lack of information is embedded in a simplistic view of pathogens and disconnected from a social and ecological context, and assumes a linear response of pathogens to environmental change. In fact, the natural reservoirs and transmission rates of most emerging infectious diseases primarily are affected by environmental factors, such as seasonality or meteorological events, typically producing nonlinear responses that are inherently unpredictable. A more realistic view of emerging infectious diseases requires a holistic perspective that incorporates social as well as physical, chemical, and biological dimensions of our planet's systems. The notion of biocomplexity captures this depth and richness, and most importantly, the interactions of human and natural systems. This article provides a brief review and a synthesis of interdisciplinary approaches and insights employing the biocomplexity paradigm and offers a social-ecological approach for addressing and garnering an improved understanding of emerging infectious diseases. Drawing on findings from studies of cholera and other examples of emerging waterborne, zoonotic, and vectorborne diseases, a ''blueprint'' for the proposed interdisciplinary research framework is offered which integrates biological processes from the molecular level to that of communities and regional systems, incorporating public health infrastructure and climate aspects.",

Newly emerging diseases caused by entirely novel or previously unrecognized pathogens, such as HIV/AIDS, SARS, and hantavirus, or those whose modes of transmission are currently under study, as in the case of Ebola and Nipah, represent yet another significant challenge. Certainly the mechanisms or processes of disease emergence involve factors in addition to those at molecular and cellular levels. These include climate, rainfall, ocean and air circulation patterns, and extreme weather events, as well as the ecology of the pathogens' reservoirs and vectors, namely those factors associated with larger-scale mechanisms and the dynamic behavior of ecosystems in which parasite (pathogen) and host relationships are embedded (Horwitz and Wilcox, 2005) . Still other factors are involved, and must be identified, if a truly holistic framework is to be constructed that incorporates factors related to human and societal mechanisms.",

Several investigators, including social scientists, conceived and elaborated on similar themes using different terminology. Ecological and social scientists working on ecosystem and natural resources management challenges refer to ''social-ecological systems'' (Berkes and Folke, 1998; Berkes et al., 2003) or ''human and natural systems'' . The contraction of social-ecological systems, ''socioecological systems,'' has been used to describe this same systems perspective, stressing coupled human-natural systems and complexity theory, in the context of health and emerging infectious diseases (Waltner-Toews, 2001) . The hyphenated or contracted terms share with biocomplexity an emphasis on the interaction of humans and nature as a complex system, and arguably embrace what is fundamentally the same paradigm. For convenience in this article, we will refer to ''human-natural systems perspective'' as synonymous with ''biocomplexity.'' We also note these ideas, including those associated with ''eco-epidemiology'' expressing the need for a broadened concept of causality in epidemiology (Kaufman and Poole, 2000) , are part of a larger emerging paradigm called ''post-normal science'' by some investigators (Ravetz, 1999) .",

The objective of this meeting was to facilitate interdisciplinary research on the problem of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. Our aim here is to provide a short review and synthesis of these interdisciplinary approaches and insights emerging from the meeting and reported in the recent literature. We use the case of cholera, the current scientific understanding of which currently provides a basis for the most complete human-natural systems model of any EID, and a complementary model based on zoonotic and vectorborne EIDs in general. Together, with two published EID case studies from this meeting, a framework is developing that has significant potential for explaining the phenomenon of global infectious disease emergence. We believe the approach has significant bearing on the interdisciplinary methodology of emerging infectious disease research, and suggests future research directions, as well as prospects for managing infectious disease emergence.",

Cholera is historically the most studied infectious disease, since the discovery of its etiology established the theory of communicable diseases and the field of epidemiology (Snow, 1855) . The relatively recent discovery (Huq et al., 1983; Colwell, 1996) of the connection of cholera with the natural environment and ecological processes has dramatically broadened the scope of cholera research. With a few exceptions, zoonotic and vectorborne diseases are, in general, readily understood as having links with the natural environment. However, the connection between their epidemiology and ecosystem dynamics or processes, not to mention coupled human-natural system behavior, is only now beginning to be appreciated. Some EIDs like SARS, Ebola, even HIV/AIDS, and the more recent and disturbingly potentially disastrous avian influenza (Aldhous and Tomlin, 2005; Osterholm, 2005) are diseases that effectively originate as zoonotic parasites or pathogens whose transmission cycles can become completely uncoupled from their animal reservoirs.",

The world has become so integrated and global (with international arrivals per year in the U.S. alone in the hundreds of millions), that the notion that a disease can be completely eradicated has become simplistic. Infectious disease is a moving target, and as the climate, as well as other sources of natural or anthropogenic environmental variation changes, any disease that has an environmentally sensitive stage, reservoir, or vector will be affected. Thus, the simplistic view must be expanded to recognize that neither ecosystems nor the pathogens that live in them respond linearly to environmental changes. Moreover, many environmental events such as climate change and seasonality, but particularly associated meteorological and oceanographic events, are inherently unpredictable by present models. The expanding field of global climate research must include the human dimension, i.e., infectious diseases. Incorporating a prediction based on signals from climate models into health measures can thereby provide new opportunities for proactive, rather than reactive, approaches to public health.",

Cholera has recurred in Peru since then, following a seasonal pattern, with the greatest number of cases in summer (June-March) in Lima and other major cities along the coast. The detection of V. cholerae followed both ambient and sea surface temperature increases and coincided with, or preceded, annual outbreaks of cholera in summer Lipp et al., 2003) . Off the Peruvian coast, there was a sig-nificant correlation between cholera incidence and elevated sea surface temperature from October 1997-June 2000, which included the 1997-1998 El Ni\u00f1o event (Gil et al., 2004) . This link suggests that an early-warning system for cholera risk could be established for Peru and neighboring countries. Although not related directly, both El Ni\u00f1o events and cholera outbreaks have increased since the 1970s. This pattern has emerged in both Peruvian waters and the Bay of Bengal. Sea surface temperature and height, as well as plankton blooms, can be remotely sensed and thus used to forecast outbreaks of cholera (Colwell, 1996) .",

The linkage of disease cycles over a four decade time series with regional climate, rainfall, river discharge, and flooding has now been demonstrated (Koelle et al., 2005) .

The picture that has emerged is that of a causal chain involving regional climatic patterns, river basin rainfall variability, river discharge and flooding, and transmission variability. The interannual variability shows a strong correspondence to climate patterns at long periods (for over 7 years for monsoon rains and Brahmaputra river discharge) and at shorter periods (under 7 years for flood extent in Bangladesh, sea surface temperatures in the Bay of Bengal, and the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation).

Yet striking similarities with cholera are surfacing that suggest its emergence follows a similar pattern of coupled human-natural system dynamics. Outbreaks commonly are associated with seasonal rainfall and floods, and like cholera, according to local knowledge held by taro farmers (Vinetz et al., 2005) , with drought conditions. If confirmed, this would lend further support to a disease emergence model incorporating the effects of anthropogenic environmental change on the hydroecology of natural drainage basins (local watersheds or river basins), contributing to decreased ecological resilience and, thereby, an increased frequency of extreme floods and droughts (Kaneshiro et al., 2005 ; [ Wilcox et al., unpublished data] ). Even without an increase in climate variability predicted to occur with anthropogenic global climate change, the interaction of natural rainfall variability with land use changes (e.g., increasing impervious surface area associated with urbanization) can explain, and is predicted to contribute to, both increased flood and drought conditions. Either appears to promote pathogen spread and survival in the environment, host-host transmission, higher prevalence in host reservoirs, increased environmental contamination by pathogenic bacteria shed by hosts, and the increased risk of human exposure as a causal chain.",

Human activity contributes through mechanisms linked across vastly different time and space scales: human behavior and exposure to contaminated water in the household, village, or city; river basin, drainage basin, or catchment management-especially related to agriculture-affecting water quality, pathogen survival, and transport; and global climate change potentially causing more extreme weather conditions, including storm and rainfall variability in general (Curriero et al., 2001) . Human mediated transport of these pathogens and their variants can be added as a global-scale mechanism. Expressing these relationships, which produce nonlinear behavior, including the abrupt and as yet unpredictable changes in microorganisms, their ecology, and the infectious diseases they cause, is very difficult. However, a human-natural systems perspective has begun to provide some insights into how to approach the problem of at least predicting the circumstances that facilitate disease emergence. Combining what cholera has taught us with the model of reemerging zoonotic and vectorborne diseases described below may provide the basis for a general theory of infectious disease emergence.",

Yet it stresses the demographic and social drivers of regional environmental change spreading geographically across the globe, as well as the failure of disease control and public health policy. Urbanization, agricultural intensification, and habitat loss and alteration, in particular, driven by population growth and consumption, characterize the model. In general, this blueprint stresses the role of regional environmental change described by land use transformations and their drivers (population, technological capacity, and sociocultural organization). These transformations have acted in concert with inadequate or inappropriate policies or methods of vector control and disease prevention that have unwittingly promoted disease emergence. The changes taking place (at the second and third levels in Fig. 2 ) affecting pathogen and host ecology and evolution (e.g., selection for insecticide and antimicrobial resistance) include public health agencies' actions, or inaction.

Thus, in the same period and places in which the most significant human-environmental transformations have been taking place in recent history, divestment in public health infrastructure, including in effective hygiene and disease control measures, has also been occurring. This is an elaboration on the argument that institutional factors, combined with dramatic changes in demographic and social conditions, including an exponential increase in global transport, are responsible for much of the global emerging infectious disease problem (Gubler, 1989; 2002a,b) . In fact, this view is complementary with that described for cholera and leptospirosis above. But it emphasizes more strongly the role of regional environmental change largely associated with urbanization, agricultural intensification, and natural habitat alteration, rather than the role of climate variability (presently observed or that predicted due to anthropogenic global climate change). Geographic shifts in vectors, effects of temperature change on pathogens and transmission rates, and other factors predicted by global climate change models (including increased climate variability) potentially will magnify disease emergence already caused by these human-natural system dynamics, again an argument for the holistic perspective.",

This theory, centered on the so-called adaptive cycle has been used to help explain why, in most cases, such management efforts have failed (e.g., most managed fisheries have either collapsed or have been over-fished, and efforts to control floods or pests frequently have resulted in worse floods or pest outbreaks). It also has been applied, in a very limited but promising degree, to the Figure 2 . Blueprint illustrating environmental factors associated with emergence of disease. Regional environmental change, which is influenced significantly by population growth, resource consumption, and waste generation, plays an important role in the emergence of infectious disease, especially in tropical developing regions. Associated land use and transformation of resource production (urbanization, agricultural expansion and intensification, and natural habitat alteration), have produced changes in ecological systems, notably in landscapes and, in turn, their natural communities and ultimately in their pathogen, animal host, and human populations. Thus, the altered ''host-pathogen'' dynamics facilitate novelty, including exchange of genetic material among pathogens, resulting in rapid adaptations by the pathogens and more frequent generation of novel pathogen variants.

Factors related to public health infrastructure and climate variability, and their interactions with regional environmental change, also contribute significantly to disease emergence.

These variables interact through the mediation of cross-scale influences, for example, floods or drought, and their increased severity because of the loss of ecological resilience arising from anthropogenic land use change. The regional environmental change model of disease emergence and the ecological resilience model noted above, that incorporates the role of extreme weather events, readily integrate into a single general model that largely explains the current global EID phenomenon. It may provide a basis for developing future scenarios, including those incorporating an increased frequency of extreme meteorological events predictable from anthropogenic global temperature increase. Holling (1986) , and subsequently , used this theoretical framework to explain the resurgence of malaria in Africa. Janssen and Martens (1997) took a similar approach, developing a model simulating malaria prevalence, taking into account adaptation of the vector and parasite and adaptive management in the application of insecticide according to mosquito abundance. However, the ''adaptive cycle'' of reflects the lack of adaptive management. It metaphorically describes a chain of events characteristic of coupled human-natural systems whereby the social and economic environment changed (more development became possible in areas protected from malaria by vector control programs), followed by a narrowing of the agencies' goal (socioeconomic initially), from the agencies' objective to spray insects and reduce mosquito populations and treat the human population, to that of distributing insecticide or antimalarial drugs. However, the persistent reduction in mosquitoes led to gradual increases in the number of people susceptible to malaria and mosquitoes resistant to insecticide. The objective to control the vector and disease succeeded, until the system itself evolved to a less resilient state producing, paradoxically, less control of the vector and disease, ending up with a return of episodic outbreaks of malaria.",

As summarized by Spiegel et al.

Outside its native range in Africa from which it spread (and ultimately the dengue virus with it) centuries ago, A. egypti's adaptability to domestic environments, including its capability of readily breeding inside dwellings, makes the disease difficult to control in the absence of integrated ''top-down'' and ''bottom-up'' vector control programs, beginning virtually at the neighborhood level. A. egypti had been, in fact, all but eliminated from Latin America by the 1970s, but its geographic distribution has since reexpanded and now extends from Paraguay to the U.S.-Mexico border. While many governments and agencies carried out ineffective, if any, vector control programs, the mosquito's habitat (human settlements) and the virus' host population (humans) grew exponentially. Ironically, reducing dengue to its pre-1970's level will require a vastly greater effort than before. This time, not only will it require a much higher level of planning and coordination of vector control efforts, but many of the same challenges facing global sustainability: increased rates of human migration, driven by poverty and political instability, and sprawling and overcrowded cities, where unscreened housing, dense residential areas with large numbers of household breeding sites (e.g., nonbiodegradable containers), and absence of waste management, sewer and water systems, produce ideal conditions for mosquito breeding.",

Spatially contagious processes, such as epidemics that spread geographically, occur only when there is an interaction among a trigger, a pathogen jumping to a new intermediate host, or a human infection event (a fast variable), and a sufficiently large and connected population of susceptible hosts or humans (a slow variable). Thus, demographic, social, and landscape transformations occurring on the scale of a regional system over a period of decades or more, interact with changes in host-parasite/pathogen dynamics that occur on the scale of a single watershed or catchment area, with a periodicity of days or months.",

Such cross-scale processes are, however, characteristic of ecosystems (Holling, 1992) and coupled human-natural systems Berkes et al., 2003) , whose dynamics are influenced by the interaction of variables and dynamics operating on vastly different time and space scales that involve natural processes discontinuously distributed, as shown in Figure 3 . An essential component of this dynamic, not easily conveyed visually (at least within the graphical representation of time and space scales), is that of resilience as a variable, both in the human and natural sub-systems comprising the human-natural environment (or social-ecological system) as a whole. This can be envisioned as the increased or diminished capacity of the system to absorb impacts of periodic events, whose timing and location is inherently unpredictable, at least at the level of current scientific understanding and available models. For example, deforestation lessens the capacity of a watershed or river basin to absorb storm events and prevent excessive runoff that is laden with nutrients and/or pathogens contributing to disease emergence. Similarly, narrowly focused and inflexible bureaucracies are unable to detect and learn from such events, so as to be able to respond with appropriate measures that either address the problem of lost resilience in the natural environment or increased vulnerability of human populations to infections, outbreaks, or epidemics-as the pathogen expands from a local toward a global scale, via cross-scale influences. The spread of waterborne pathogens by flooding and other pathogens by human migration, transport, or other spreading modalities, is illustrated by the widening plume in the center of the space-time graph (Fig. 3) .",

As a public health issue this can, unfortunately, be misconstrued as suggesting a lack of consensus among experts that the potential human health consequences-though as yet not clearly demonstratedare of significant concern . Uncertainty, due both to an incomplete picture of how climate and pathogens interact as well as the complexity inherent in human-natural systems, has been a major factor. Moreover, few longitudinal disease databases are long enough in time to study long-term trends required to monitor health effects of climate change. However, the progress made in understanding cholera's reemergence and that of zoonotic and vectorborne EIDs generally, has been significant and has, to some extent, begun to reduce uncertainty.",

            "text": "Most modeling of the effects of climate change have been done with the focus on malaria (e.g., Martens et al., 1999; Rogers and Randolf, 2000) , the only zoonotic and vectorborne EID for which adequate climate change or variability models and surveillance data of sufficient resolution were available (van Lieshout et al., 2004) , at least until recently (e.g., Hales et al., 2002; Brownstein et al., 2005) . Though at first considered too simplistic (Rogers and Randolph, 2000) , the malaria models have attempted to incorporate an increasing realism, taking into account altitudinal instead of latitudinal shifts alone, and the adaptive capacity of public health infrastructure, in addi-tion to socioeconomic conditions (Haines and Patz, 2004; van Lieshout et al., 2004) . The MARA (Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa) project is one such example. Derived maps of malaria suitability (based on climate) were compared with previously collected, independent data including surveys, site visits, parasite rates, and spleen rates gathered in several East African countries and providing a more thorough validation than past climate-malaria modeling (MARA/AMRA, 1998) . Excluding any increase in population, an increase of 16%-28% in person-month exposure to malaria risk by year 2100 was determined (Tanser et al., 2003) . In spite of these improvements and the availability of increasingly high resolution geographic data, the reliability of projections for vectorborne diseases, in general, has been hampered by the complex and nonlinear dynamics of the relationship between the vector population . Time and space scales of demographic units, disease processes, and environmental events. Climate variability and meteorological events, with distinct periodicities and occurring on specific geographic scales, interact with the dynamics of the pathogen-host (human populations in this example) that occur on similar scales. For example, a local windstorm or rainstorm can disperse mosquitoes or waterborne pathogens within a locality. Factors, such as social behavior and specific environmental conditions that are characteristic for a given human population, can determine whether or not a disease agent will flourish in an environment and be transmitted among hosts, including humans, in a particular settlement. Meteorological events that affect the environment, such as seasonal monsoon rains or the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which occur on a larger scale in time and space, can induce drought or flood conditions. The result can be the spread of a disease agent(s), setting the stage for epidemics, the occurrence of which will, in turn, depend on human population factors, such as human behavior and the level of herd immunity. Additional variables can facilitate disease emergence, i.e., increased connectivity created by urbanization, increased rate of regional migration, and global transport; and/or decreased social and ecological system resilience, resulting, for example, in more severe and larger scale impacts of the meteorological event. and disease prevalence. This is a result of the interactions between transmission rates, the rate of development and duration of temporary acquired immunity, and the age structure of the population, for which the field data are too limited to resolve (Rogers et al., 2002) .",

Nor can current modeling approaches account for locally or regionally abrupt climatic shifts that have proven societally disruptive in the past (Alley et al., 2003) . Predicting the timing, spatial scale, and intensity of such shifts and their effects on transmission rates, host susceptibility, socioeconomic conditions, and public health infrastructure defies conventional analytical modeling. However, some projections for malaria have incorporated measures of ''adapative capacity'' based on expert opinion (van Lieshout et al., 2004) . This notion has received recent attention, due to the coastal disasters in South Asia and the U.S., producing qualitative indicators of resilience (Adger et al., 2005) . These potentially are quantifiable and could at least provide a basis for assessment and predictions of local-and regional-scale social-ecological resilience in response to the effects of abrupt change.",

Moreover, the validity and robustness of some of the key relationships, including the quantitative expressions describing them, are beyond dispute. For example, the mechanisms involved and the relationship of species extinction to habitat loss, in general (Rosenzweig, 1995) , and the case of tropical forest, in particular (Laurence and Bierregaard, 1997) , are relatively well understood, empirically demonstrated, and follow quantitative rules that are among the most thoroughly documented in ecology. The effect of climate change on habitat in terms of latitudinal and altitudinal shifts resulting in the contraction in the areal extent of many types of habitat is virtually certain. So, too, is the corresponding reduction in the sizes of local and regional populations of vulnerable wildlife species. These direct impacts on natural ecological communities, along with the effects of urbanization and agricultural intensifi-cation shown in Figure 2 , undoubtedly will affect pathogen emergence in ecosystems through multiple feedback loops linking ecosystem disturbance, local extinction, and disease (Harvell et al., 2002) . Ecosystem-focused infectious disease research will require monitoring and surveillance that integrate wildlife and human disease (Deem et al., 2005) .",
