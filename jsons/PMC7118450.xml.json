Immigrants are aliens who wish to enter the United States on a permanent basis, whereas nonimmigrants are aliens who seek to enter the United States on a temporary basis and for a specific purpose. A lawful permanent resident, more commonly known as a green card holder, is a person who has been granted the privilege of permanently residing in the United States as an immigrant.",

The DHS also considers whether the alien might transmit HIV or incur any costs to the U.S. government. In instances in which admission would bring a public benefit, waivers are granted for 30 days or less to attend a scientific, professional, or academic conference; receive medical treatment; visit close family members; or conduct business.

In March 2003, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 created the USDHS, which resulted in a restructuring of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Three bureaus were created under DHS to replace INS. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services assumed responsibility for administration of immigration benefits and services.

The DHS proposed that this procedure was more streamlined because decisions could be made at the consular level; however, HIV advocacy groups disagreed. These groups pointed to the use of the term categorical as erroneous, because it applied to the DHS's authorization of the consular offices in the traveler's country to make the decision versus granting a blanket authorization to HIV-infected travelers who met the criteria (Gay Men's Health Crisis, 2007).",

For example, use of the categorical waiver requires applicants to sign a written waiver of any rights to change their status while in the United States, which includes application for permanent legal residence. This is a new provision that concerns many HIV advocacy groups because it could be interpreted that use of the waiver program forever bans the ability to apply for a green card. Another portion of the proposed regulations that concerns advocacy groups is that failure to comply could result in permanent ineligibility. Travelers face a possible lifetime ban from entering the United States again if they break one of the conditions, such as falling ill during a visit and being unable to pay for the medical expenses incurred.",

These organizations note that the travel ban has no scientific, medical, or public health benefit (ANAC, 2007). Critics point out that other sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis and human papilloma virus do not receive the same treatment under the immigration regulations as HIV. Concerns exist that the rules do not require consular officers to be trained in making medical determinations of medical etiology, medication, transmission, and public health concerns (Gay Men's Health Crisis, 2007).
