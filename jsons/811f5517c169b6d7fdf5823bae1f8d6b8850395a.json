At the time of writing this article, there are officially about five million infections and more than 300 000 deaths. Statistics vary widely from country to country, revealing significant differences in anticipation and management of the crisis. We propose to examine the COVID-19 epidemic in Tunisia through mathematical models, which aim to determine the actual number of infected cases and to predict the course of the epidemic. As of May 11, 2020, there are officially 1032 COVID-19 infected cases in Tunisia. 45 people have died. Using a mathematical model based on the number of reported infected cases, the number of deaths, and the effect of the 18-day delay between infection and death, this study estimates the actual number of COVID-19 cases in Tunisia as 2555 cases. This paper analyses the evolution of the epidemic in Tunisia using population dynamics with an SEIR model combining susceptible cases S(t), asymptomatic infected cases A(t), reported infected cases V (t), and unreported infected cases U (t). This work measures the basic reproduction number R 0 , which is the average number of people infected by a COVID-19 infected person. The model predicts an R 0 = 2.73. Strict containment measures have led to a significant reduction in the reproduction rate. Contact tracing and respect for isolation have an impact: at the current time, we compute that Tunisia has an R t = 0.42 (95% CI 0.14-0.70). These values depend on physical separation and can vary over time depending on the management of suspicious cases. Their objective estimation and the study of their evolution are however necessary to understand the pandemic and to reduce their unintended damage (due to an absence of symptoms, or the confusion of certain symptoms with less contagious diseases, or unavailable or unreliable tests).",

The real indicator of the danger of the epidemic is the fatality rate, which represents the proportion of deaths compared to the total number of infected cases. The fatality rate for COVID-19 in Tunisia is 0.044 per 100 000 people. These values are temporary and incomplete. They were based on the tests carried out (the polymerase chain reaction, denoted by PCR, has a sensitivity of 70% [7] ). The number of deaths is recorded in hospitals and does not include deaths at home (therefore of cases not reported).

The three phases of COVID-19 epidemics as defined in [11] can be decomposed as a linear phase, exponential growth, and decreasing stage. The linear growth in the number of reported cases (from March 5 to March 24) is where the number of daily reported cases is almost constant day after day. The second phase of the epidemic corresponds to an exponential increasing phase, it starts on March 25, 2020. The third phase of the epidemic starts on April 17, 2020 . It corresponds to a time-dependent exponentially decreasing transmission rate, due to major public interventions and social distancing measures.",

If the basic reproduction number R 0 is greater than 1, countries need to take action because the progression of the virus could lead to an exponential phase. If it is less than 1 then new cases per day go to zero. Changes in transmission speed over time are recommended to bring it down the critical threshold of 1. We address the following fundamental issues concerning this epidemic in Tunisia: How will the epidemic evolve concerning the number of reported cases and unreported cases? How will the number of unreported cases influence the severity of the epidemic? What is the effect of the massive containment policies (decided on March 25, 2020, in Tunisia) on the epidemic? To answer these questions, we developed mathematical models that recover from data of reported cases and the number of unreported cases for the COVID-19 epidemic.",

The principle is to divide the population into epidemiological classes such as those susceptible to infection, those who are infectious, and those who have recovered and acquired immunity or are deceased. The state of the epidemic is determined by knowing the size of these three classes of the population. At each point in time t, we can consider the number S(t) of susceptible people, the number I(t) of infected people, and the number R(t) of recovered (and therefore immune) or deceased people. Each of these quantities is a function of time t, which we cannot measure at all times, but it is measured regularly at certain times (for example daily or hourly), and these measures provide both an abstract model of this function and a daily assessment of the epidemic. The functions S(t), I(t) and R(t) are linked to each other bylaws that describe how they influence each other. For example, their sum S(t) + I(t) + R(t) represents the total population which therefore remains constant over time.",

It is obtained from the SIR model by adding a new epidemiological class to take into account the duration of incubation, namely exposed people (infected non-infectious) who are therefore not contagious, represented by the function E(t). The purpose of the model is to predict forward in time the future number of cases in a time-line of the epidemic from early reported case data. A typical SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, removed) model is given in [10] . Assume that infected individuals were not infectious during the incubation period [25] . Assume population growth rate and death rate are zero. Assume people exhibit consistent behaviours before and during epidemic phase [26] . Assume no quarantine or other mitigation intervention is implemented. All these assumptions directly influence the model, which is dependent on several parameters. See [20] for a more precise idea of the evolution of these assumptions. Sophisticated SEIR/SIRU models are developed in [21] , but we choose to follow the approach of [11] to have a starting point of view of the epidemic. It produces a result closer to the realistic basic reproductive number R 0 .",

Any of these infected populations can transmit the virus to susceptible people S(t).

The function U (t) represents symptomatic people not listed by the public authorities. They are infected people with symptoms but who do not know they are carrying the virus. They are therefore not officially recognised as infected (either because the COVID-19 test turned out to be negative, or because they simply escaped the various checks put in place).

Fig. 5 shows the number of t \u2192 CR(t), the unreported cases t \u2192 U (t), and the data corresponding to the confirmed cumulated cases for Tunisia, without containment measures. The reproduction number R 0 = 2.73 is quite high and the damage of COVID-19 came from the virulence of the symptoms. In the literature, the value of R 0 varies from 1.4 to 3.9 [17] . A more sophisticated model is developed in [3] to examine the effects of an outbreak with control policies, it gives an R 0 in the same range. The measure of the effective reproduction number R t under the current severe containment conditions in Tunisia, using the Bayes' theorem, gives R t = 0.42 with CI 0.14 -0.70 at May 11, 2020 (for an optimal \u03c3 = 0.2 and \u03b7 = 1/7). Fig. 6 shows that it leads to small outbreaks that eventually become extinguished. To avoid overfitting on any one state, we choose the \u03c3 that maximizes P (k) over every state.

An epidemic outbreak of a new human coronavirus COVID-19 occurred in Tunisia. The unreported cases and the disease transmission rate are useful information. We estimate an actual number of infected cases in Tunisia based on the 18-day effect from infection to death and a mortality rate equal to 2%. We find that the number of cases on May 11 is at least equal to 2 555 infected cases, the worst case is about 4% of the population. In fact, according to the SEIR model with asymptomatic and symptomatic compartments, where the transmission rate \u03b2 = 2.76 10 \u22128 , the total number of reported cases is 472 457 population near the turning point May 15. On May 11, the number of cases was 1032 infected, 45 dead, and a total population of 11 818 619. The effective production rate puts Tunisia in the leading of its neighbours. It shows very good management of the epidemic by Tunisia, especially on the number of deaths, Recovery, and Infected cases.",

The reproductive number R 0 is equal to 2.73 for a fixed fraction f = 0.8 of symptomatic cases that are reported and for a removal rate \u03bd = 7. Effective reproduction number R t is given by matching the data, day by day, using Bayes' theorem. On May 17, R t is equal to 0.42 (95% CI 0.14-0.70) where \u03b7 = 1/7 and \u03c3 = 0.2. The effective reproduction number R t has reduced to less than 1: public measures were taken, such as isolation, quarantine, and public closings, strict travel restrictions, face mask for everyone, and reliable targeted testing. These measures exacerbate the spread of this disease and mitigate the final size of the epidemic [21] . It is contained in Tunisia, provided that quality of care and social distancing measures are in place. This protection may involve several factors, such as genetic predispositions, the immune status of populations, the history of vaccinations, and in particular what is known as training immunity, which is currently being discussed when BCG vaccination is involved [15] . Compared to other countries, there is a certain level of protection that must be understood (in the biological and immunological sense) to take advantage of it for better control of this disease or others that will arise. Finding a vaccine, testing the miracle cure would reduce evolution.",

The reopening of the borders without severe distancing measures could have an impact and consequences for the epidemic outcome: Tunisia is heavily exposed from different Chinese airports (Guangdong province and weakly to Zhejiang province) as the main source of entry risk [9] . Several infection waves are expected, and they could be spread over several years [16] . The mathematical models outlined in this research could help anticipate the damage to the health care system that they could cause promptly. Using models applied to hospital and death data, further work will be carried out to estimate the impact of containment, as well as the current immunity of the population [19] . In terms of public health implications, to stop the outbreak, at least 58-76% of transmissions should be blocked. And we will no longer talk about this pandemic when 2/3 of the population will have been in contact with the virus. In the meantime, confinement could become a toxic situation for our democracies: For societies like Tunisia the ease with which entire sections of the population living in precarious conditions are endangered [23] .
