The etiologic agent of the syndrome, a novel coronavirus termed SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified [1], [2], [3]. Although the epidemic was eventually controlled, the high morbidity and mortality make it extremely urgent to develop effective means to prevent this disease. Therefore, a successful vaccine against SARS-CoV remains a high priority. The unique opportunity of studying survivors of the infection allows for delineation of the T-cell populations implicated in the protective immunity, and those T cells would be the target population for expansion via a vaccine.",

In addition, SARS-CoV-specific IgG antibody can be detected at week 3 after the onset of syndrome in SARS patients and persistent for a long period of time [9], [10]. Polyclonal immune sera from convalescent SARS patients were passively transferred to treat SARS patients during the outbreak in 2003 [11].

Although it has been demonstrated that DNA vaccine encoding the S protein of SARS-CoV can induce antigen-specific T-cell responses in animal models [4], [12], the protective effect of T cells specific for the S protein in humans remains undefined [13]. Thus, it is essential to determine whether recovered SARS patients maintained cell-mediated immunity against SARS-CoV and how long this immunity will persist. In addition, the phenotypic characteristics of memory CD4+ or CD8+ T cells specific for SARS-CoV have not been extensively studied. In this study, we analyzed CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses in peripheral blood of recovered SARS patients to a pool of 169 overlapping SARS-CoV S peptides and characterized the phenotype of memory T-cell subpopulations. Our study demonstrated that SARS-CoV S-specific memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood of recovered SARS patients were persistent for more than 1 year after infection. These memory T cells revealed both effector and central memory phenotypes.",

The SARS-CoV S peptides, however, elicited a strong antigen-specific T-cell response in recovered SARS patients with an average number of spot-forming cells (SFC) 49/2 \u00d7 105 PBMCs (range 18 to 109) (Fig. 1B), which were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than spot-producing cells in healthy donors (1\u20136 spots in 2 \u00d7 105 PBMCs) when PBMCs were stimulated with SARS-CoV S peptides. Moreover, the PBMCs from recovered SARS patients revealed similar frequency of IFN-\u03b3-forming cells (328/2 \u00d7 105 PBMCs) compared with the PBMCs from healthy individuals (299/2 \u00d7 105 PBMCs) when stimulated with PMA plus ionomycin (P > 0.05) (data not shown).

The results showed that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from 5 recovered SARS patients failed to secret IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 in the absence of SARS-CoV S peptides. However, addition of SARS-CoV S peptides to cultures resulted in the expression of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell populations. Two representative examples, patient 2 and patient 5, are shown in Figs. 2A and B. The percentage of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from 5 recovered SARS patients in SARS-CoV S-peptide-stimulated cultures was significantly higher than that from unstimulated cells (P < 0.05) (Fig. 2C), whereas no difference was observed in the proportion of IL-2-producing CD8 T cells between those two groups (P > 0.05).

Consistent with previous reports, our results indicated that the majority of total CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4A) expressed high levels of CCR7 (85%) (Fig. 4C) and CD62L (77%) (Fig. 4D), whereas approximately 40% of CD4+ T cells expressed CD45RO (Figs. 4C, D). SARS-CoV S-specific IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+ T cells (Fig. 4B) had an increased expression of CD45RO (Fig. 4C) but had decreased expression of CD62L (Fig. 4D) compared with total CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, the majority of antigen-specific CD4+ IFN-\u03b3+ cells were CD45RO+ CCR7+ (Fig. 4C) or CD45RO+ CD62L\u2212 (Fig. 4D). In contrast, a total of CD8+ T cells (Fig. 5A) expressed low level of CCR7 (Fig. 5C) and CD62L (Fig. 5D) compared with total CD4+ T cells.

However, little is known about memory CD4+ T-cell responses to SARS-CoV. Consistent with observation in mouse model [4], we found that both memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells participated in cellular responses to SARS-CoV. It is known that naive CD4+ T cells can be divided into two major subpopulations, Th1 and Th2, based on cytokine production and biological functions [16]. The Th1 cells are composed of IFN-\u03b3+ and IFN-\u03b3\u2212 cells. The IFN-\u03b3\u2212 Th1 cells may differentiate into memory cells in vivo [17]. Based on the production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2, SARS-CoV S-specific CD4+ T cells could be divided into three distinct populations: single IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells, double IFN-\u03b3/IL-2-secreting cells and single IL-2-secreting cells. Interestingly, IFN-\u03b3/IL-2 double positive CD4+ T cells were mainly restricted to IFN-\u03b3high IL-2high subset. These results further demonstrated the heterogeneity of memory Th1 cells and also indicated that distinct subpopulations of memory CD4+ T cells have different capacities to develop into short (IFN-\u03b3+) and long-lived (IFN-\u03b3+ IL-2+ and IL-2+) memory cells.",

This observation is in agreement with recent studies showing that only central memory CD8+ T cells produce IL-2 following a short-peptide stimulation in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV)-infected mouse model [19]. Generally, the expression of CD62L is associated with the expression of CCR7 [20]. Surprisingly, SARS-CoV S-specific memory CD4+ T cells expressed a mixed CCR7+ CD62L\u2212 phenotype that differs from phenotypes of classical CCR7+ CD62L+ TCM and CCR7\u2212 CD62L\u2212 TEM cells. Some groups have also found memory CD4+ or CD8+ T cells expressing a mixed CCR7+ CD62L\u2212 phenotype in mouse model [21], [22]. These studies suggest that the expression of CCR7 and CD62L in memory CD4+ or CD8+ T cells may overlap only partially.",

In our study, the majority of IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4+ T cells were CCR7+. This is supported by evidence that memory Th1 cells are mainly CCR7+ in mice [23]. Recent report has identified two functional distinct populations of memory CD8+ T cells: double IFN-\u03b3/IL-2-secreting cells and single IFN-\u03b3-secreting cells. Virus-specific IFN-\u03b3/IL-2-secreting CD8+ T cells were CD45RA\u2212 CCR7\u2212, whereas single IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD8+ T cells were either CD45RA\u2212 CCR7\u2212 or CD45RA+ CCR7\u2212\n[24]. Consistent with observations in HIV infection, we showed that SARS-CoV S-specific CD8+ T cells produced IFN-\u03b3 but not IL-2 and predominantly displayed CD45RO\u2212 CCR7\u2212 phenotype which might represent terminally differentiated effector memory T cells [25]. This may reflect difference in the inherent stability of CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells that are CCR7\u2212 in normal steady-state conditions [26].",
