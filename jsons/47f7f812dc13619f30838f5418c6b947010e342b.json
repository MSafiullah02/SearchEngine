The total number of confirmed cases has exceeded 1.6 million in just 2 months. 1 Patients with a variety of respiratory symptoms have flooded into hospitals in a relative short time, posing an enormous challenge to every healthcare system. Wuhan was the first center of the pandemic, and it had the highest number of cases in China. But the pandemic in Wuhan was controlled by 2 months of lockdown beginning January 23, 2020, and newly detected cases of COVID-19 have now decreased to zero. Among a series of preventive approaches, 2 cabin hospitals played a critical role in isolating mild and asymptomatic cases. Here, we evaluate the role of cabin hospitals in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic by retrospectively analyzing the correlation between available beds in cabin hospitals and epidemic data.",

COVID-19 cases were diagnosed according to history, symptoms, chest CT, and nucleic acid test. 3 From February 12 to February 14, a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 was applied to make sure that every patient received immediate treatment in Wuhan. Therefore, the number of cases diagnosed in these 3 days dramatically increased, and we was excluded these data from our analysis. We used SPSS version 19.0 software (IBM, Armonk, NY) for the statistical analysis. A Pearson correlation analysis was performed by correlating cabin beds with all epidemic data. P < .05 was considered a significant difference.",

In addition, we detected a significantly decrease of severe cases in the hospital with the increase of cabin beds (r = \u22120.977; P < .0001). The approaches for prevention and control of COVID-19 can vary from city to city. However, the principle of controlling contagious diseases is to isolate the source of infection, to cut off transmission, and to protect vulnerable populations. 4 Although both COVID-19 and SARS are respiratory diseases caused by coronavirus, COVID-19 differs from SARS 5 in that many mild and asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 also have transmissibility, and these cases are often missed and not isolated. Therefore, the management of mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases is equally important as the treatment of severe cases. Our analysis showed that, with the increase of available beds by cabin hospitals, the newly diagnosed cases and severe cases decreased. Thus, the cabin hospitals played an important role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. They effectively prevented family infection or community spread. Early treatment of mild cases can prevent COVID-19 cases from deteriorating.",

All admitted patients were diagnosed by a positive nucleic acid test, concern regarding cross infection was alleviated. In these temporary hospitals, patients were also cared for by professional medical staff. When a case became severe, the patient was transferred to a designated infectious hospital immediately. Food, accommodation, medication, and examination were paid by the government. These incentives greatly increased the motivation of mildly ill patients to be admitted to cabin hospitals, which reduced social mobility and the risk of community infection. At the same time, timely medical treatment also improved prognoses, avoiding exacerbation of the disease. 6 In addition, initiation of cabin hospitals reduced the workload of designated infectious hospitals, so the limited public medical resources could be used to treat severe patients and thus reduce the death rate.",
