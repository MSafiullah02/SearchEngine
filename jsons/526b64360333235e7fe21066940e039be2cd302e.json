The aim of this study was the further characterization of these cells in the liver with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Liver mononuclear cells (MNC) were isolated from liver specimens obtained from the patients during abdominal surgery. In addition to a flow cytometric analysis, liver MNC and PBMC were cultured with the immobilized anti-CD3 Ab, IL-2, or a combination of IL-2 and IL-12 and their IFN-\u2425 production and the antitumor cytotoxicity were assessed. The liver MNC of HCV (\u060a) patients contained 20% CD56 \u0609 T cells whereas the same proportions decreased to 11% in chronic hepatitis livers and to 5% in cirrhotic livers. The proportion of NK cells also decreased in the cirrhotic livers. On the other hand, the populations of these cells in PBMC did not significantly differ among patient groups. The IFN-\u2425 production and the cytotoxicity against K562 cells, Raji cells, and a hepatocellular carcinoma, HuH-7 cells, greatly decreased in the cirrhotic liver MNC. In contrast, the cytotoxicity in PBMC did not significantly differ among the patient groups and was lower than that in the liver MNC of HCV (\u060a) patients. CD56 \u0609 T cells and NK cells but not regular T cells purified from liver MNC cultured with cytokines showed potent cytotoxicities against HuH-7 cells. These results suggest that a decreased number of CD56 \u0609 T cells and NK cells in cirrhotic livers may be related to their susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma.

            "text": "Chronic viral hepatitis patients, especially hepatitis C patients, often fall victim to liver cirrhosis and subsequent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 1 It is now believed that the HCV infection in hepatocytes itself is not cytopathic whereas the cellular immune response to infected hepatocytes may indeed cause hepatocyte injury. 1 It has been suggested that nonspecific NK cell activation 1,2 and viral antigen-specific ac-tivation of either CD4 \u03e9 T cells or cytotoxic CD8 \u03e9 T cells may be responsible for hepatocyte injury. 1, [3] [4] [5] [6] Consistent with this hypothesis, it has also been reported that liver lymphocytes expressed T helper 1 cytokine, IFN-\u2425, and IL-2 messenger RNA, and the serum levels of these cytokines were elevated in the patients with HCV. 7, 8 On the other hand, livers from mice and humans have recently been reported to contain not only a large population of NK cells but also of T cells with NK cell markers. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Namely, mouse NK1.1 antigen \u03e9 T (NKT) cells and human CD56 \u03e9 T cells are abundant in the livers. NKT cells in mice were activated by IL-12 and inhibited tumor metastases in the liver of mice 10, 11, [14] [15] [16] (for a review, see Seki et al., 16 ). Human peripheral blood CD56 \u03e9 T cells were also activated in vitro by IL-12 and thus acquired an antitumor cytotoxicity against NK-resistant tumors. 13 Furthermore, strongly activated mouse liver NKT cells destroyed the syngeneic hepatocytes. 17 Therefore, the possibility has been raised that human CD56 \u03e9 T cells may also play an important role in both hepatocyte injury in chronic viral hepatitis and antitumor immunity in the liver. In the present study, we show that human liver MNC activated by anti-CD3 Ab or a combination of IL-2 and IL-12 (or IL-2 alone) both produced IFN-\u2425 and killed tumors more effectively than did PBMC. Furthermore, human liver CD56 \u03e9 T cells and CD56 \u03e9 NK cells gradually decreased in parallel with the progress of the hepatitis C and diminished in livers with cirrhosis. These liver MNC from cirrhotic livers could not effectively produce IFN-\u2425 and could not effectively kill not only K562 cells and Raji cells but also a human HCC cell line, HuH-7 cells, thus suggesting that the decrease in CD56 \u03e9 T cells and NK cells may be one of the mechanisms explaining why HCC frequently originates from cirrhotic livers.",

However, it should be noted that liver MNC from cirrhotic livers or PBMC of nonhepatitis patients, when stimulated with IL-2 and IL-12, produced IFN-\u2425 comparable with those from HCV (\u03ea) liver MNC. Therefore, regular T cells also have the capacity to produce IFN-\u2425 under certain conditions. Taken together, it is suggested that Ag specific regular T cells, NK cells, and CD56 \u03e9 T cells are all activated to produce Th1 cytokines and eradicate virusinfected hepatocytes so as to inhibit the replication of hepatitis virus. In fact, IFN-\u2425 receptor mutant mice have been reported to be susceptible to coronavirus-induced hepatitis. 34 However, it should be noted that because HCV replicates at a rapid rate but lacks proofreading ability, it thus has a large genetic diversity. 1 It may therefore avoid effective surveillance of the host cellular immunity unless it is eradicated in the acute phase of hepatitis C.",

NKT cells in mice mainly use V\u242314 gene products for their T cell receptors 35, 36 and V\u242324 \u03e9 T cells in humans have been suggested to be the counterparts of mouse NKT cells because the V\u242314 gene of mice and the V\u242324 gene of humans have a sequence homology, 36 and both responded CD1 dependently to \u2423-galactosylceramide to produce IFN-\u2425 and acquire an antitumor cytotoxicity. [37] [38] [39] However, V\u242324 \u03e9 T cells were rarely found in both human PBMC and the liver MNC in the present study, and liver MNC and PBMC stimulated with \u2423-galactosylceramide did not produce IFN-\u2425 and did not acquire antitumor cytotoxicity (our unpublished observation, March, 2000) . It is therefore suggested that although mouse V\u242314 \u03e9 T cells and human V\u242324 \u03e9 T cells are indeed a counterpart of each other, the role in host immune responses of human V\u242324 \u03e9 T cells might be more limited than that of mouse V\u242314 \u03e9 T cells. Because NK1.1 Ag of mice and CD161 in humans are both belong to the NKR-P1 family, 26 we proposed that CD56 \u03e9 T cells (more precisely, CD161 \u03e9 CD56 \u03e9 T cells) are a functional counterpart of NKT cells in mice as evidenced by their common properties of the tissue localization, IFN-\u2425 production, and also their antitumor function. 16 In other words, human CD56 \u03e9 T cells constitute more heterogeneous populations than mouse NKT cells as was also pointed out by Doherty et al. 40 Because Kupffer cells, which were activated with various bacterial stimuli produced IL-12 and activated NKT cells as well as NK cells 41, 42 and the in vivo depletion of Kupffer cells in mice suppressed the antitumor activity of liver MNC, 42 Kupffer cells may also play an important role in the antitumor immunity of the liver.",

Ohkawa et al., submitted), thus indicating that the abundance of CD56 \u03e9 T cells and NK cells and the decrease of these cells in the liver are responsible for the potent IFN-\u2425 production in the MNC from livers without cirrhosis and the decreased IFN-\u2425 production in the MNC from cirrhotic livers, respectively.",
