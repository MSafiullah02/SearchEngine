The work of Barry Wellman and colleagues suggests that community has been redefined rather than replaced by the Internet. The medium's ability to connect across space enables the simultaneous, but partial, involvement of users in a wide range of weak ties (Granovetter, 1973). For Wellman the immediacy of the Internet facilitates greater \u2018personalization\u2019\u2013 the tailoring of information retrieval and dissemination to highly particular preferences. Rather than expressing core group solidarities, communities become person\u2010to\u2010person interchanges, part of a repertoire of multiple associations, a \u2018networked individualism\u2019 (Wellman, 2001; Wellman et al., 2003).",

Digital media \u2018change the dynamics of diaspora\u2019 by facilitating new forms of connection between here and home (Karim, 2002). They are an integral element of the diasporic habitus, the portable, yet durable, manifestations of difference which define the cultural distinctiveness of transnational migrants (Parker, 2003). Engagement with Internet content has redefined the intangible moods, tones and embodied dispositions constituting the diasporic habitus (Panagakos, 2003).",

Ong's focus is \u2018the translocal publics constituted by professionals online (. . .) directly engaged in the production of global ethnicities\u2019 (Ong, 2003: 92).

It can support a variety of identity formations. The two web sites we analyse below express the complex mixture of local, national and racialised loyalties felt by many British\u2010born Chinese and South Asians. Growing up negotiating these potentially discrepant affinities can generate an ironic self\u2010recognition as located in both \u2018East\u2019 and \u2018West\u2019 without being confined to either, creating \u2018a new representational landscape for issues of identity\u2019 (Nakamura, 2002b). Twenty years after Stuart Hall's suggestive discussion of \u2018new ethnicities\u2019 (Hall, 1988), the Internet is enabling novel forms of communication within, as well beyond, national boundaries.

In this small\u2010scale research Asian and Chinese people are at least as likely to have used the Internet as the majority population, and more likely to have accessed it than Black British people. For Asians and Chinese in Britain, Internet use may be widespread due to high participation in post\u2010school education, youthful age structure (National Statistics, 2004), and the increasing technological proficiency of the East and South Asian nations with which there are ongoing family connections.",

In addition, there is very little evidence of dialogue with other ethnic groups on either site, with the danger that \u2018narrow band imaginings (. . .) hardly aid the cause of genuinely democratic deliberation\u2019 (Goodin, 2003: 70). Further steps are needed to turn these web sites into enduring counterpublics, projecting oppositional voices into a public realm \u2018in which free, open and responsive dialogical interaction takes place\u2019 (Bohman, 2004: 144). This would require making spaces for the exchange of opinions into more systematic interventions in decision\u2010making processes. Yet given the novelty of the technology, it would be harsh to judge these forums by the inappropriately rigorous standard of a Habermasian public sphere (Habermas, 1989) and then find them wanting. Instead their value in encouraging political participation by bringing previously unrecognised experiences into the public domain should be acknowledged (Siapera, 2005).",

Existing campaigning organisations increasingly have their events highlighted in messages on the British Born Chinese web site. In June 2005 users of the discussion board highlighted a public forum on anti\u2010Chinese racism held at the House of Lords, and organised by the Chinese civil rights group Min Quan. Mainstream political institutions have begun to use the barfiCulture site to communicate with the British Asian population. In spring 2004 the British government's Electoral Commission used the barfiCulture site to conduct a survey of young British Asians' views on voting and political participation.
