Up to 30% of patients undergoing chemotherapy for acute leukaemia may be affected (Chaoui et al, 2004; Garcia et al, 2013) , particularly those with pre-existing pulmonary disease and those who smoke. Around 12-15% of severely neutropenic patients with first fever will present with lung infiltrates (LI) (Maschmeyer et al, 1994) , and half of patients without abnormalities on CXR, who remain febrile after at least 48 h of broadspectrum antibacterial treatment, will show LI on pulmonary CT scans (Heussel et al, 1999) . Respiratory complications are also frequent among patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and often run a complicated clinical course due to the complex immunodeficiency. Respiratory events (RE) affect less than 1 in 10 of autologous stem cell transplant recipients (Reich et al, 2001) . However, this proportion may be as high as 15%, particularly among patients with myeloma who experience 7 or more days of severe neutropenia with a substantial associated mortality.",

However, at least during febrile neutropenia, virological diagnostic tests are seldom ordered because of uncertainty about their relevance and the lack of effective agents to treat these infections. The vast majority of RSV infections occur among haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, while reports on viral pneumonia in other patients mainly involve out-patients and show conflicting results with regard to their clinical importance (Lehners et al, 2013) . Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was identified in the early 2000s and affects up to 9% of adult patients with HM and symptoms of respiratory tract infection (Williams et al, 2005) , but the outcome tends to be favourable despite the absence of effective anti-hMPV antivirals (Godet et al, 2014) .

However, among neutropenic patients with fever persisting despite more than 48 h of broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy, only about 10% of CXR show abnormalities, while high-resolution CT scans taken at the same time show pathological findings in approximately 50% of patients (Heussel et al, 1999) . Abnormalities seen on CXR indicate a CT scan should be done to more specifically identify the most likely aetiology. Hence, a CXR is of very limited value, as a pulmonary CT scan (without contrast media) must be ordered anyway as soon as possible, preferably as part of the investigation of fever during neutropenia.",

The 'halo sign', i.e., a dense nodular infiltrate surrounded by an area of ground-glass opacity representing an infarction and a haemorrhage, has been described as characteristic for neutropenic patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) (Bruno et al, 2007) . The 'reversed halo sign', showing a focal rounded area of ground-glass opacity surrounded by a crescent or complete ring of consolidation, has been reported to be relatively specific for fungal pneumonia due to mucormycosis (Georgiadou et al, 2011; Legouge et al, 2014) . However, it also may also be associated with other lung diseases, such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (Godoy et al, 2012) ; \u2022 The pattern of LI on the CT scan may also help to distinguish fungal from other aetiologies of LI (Caillot et al, 1997; Heussel et al, 2004) . PcP typically causes diffuse perihilar infiltrates, areas of ground-glass attenuation, cysts and septal thickening, consolidation and centrilobular nodules (Kanne et al, 2012; Vogel et al, 2012) . However, this 'classical PcP pattern' has also been described for LI from acute leukaemia (Potenza et al, 2003) . Nodular or cavitary lesions indicate an invasive 'mould' disease, while differential diagnoses include pneumonia caused by other microorganisms, such as mycobacteria (in patients from high prevalence areas), Nocardia, Pneumocystis jirovecii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa and infiltrates by the underlying malignancy (Shorr et al, 2004) .",

It is essential to distinguish infection from colonization as this may affect over half of individuals without any signs or symptoms of PcP (Ponce et al, 2010) . Meta-analysis of PCR showed the test to exhibit both high sensitivity (99%) and specificity (90%) (Lu et al, 2011) . Hence, a negative test result on a BAL sample indicates that anti-Pneumocystis therapy is unnecessary. More recently, quantitative PCR assays have been shown to boost the specificity. A report on non-HIV 71 patients with proven PcP showed a positive predictive value of 98% when more than 1450 organisms per ml were detected in BAL samples (M\u20ac uhlethaler et al, 2012) , however, this threshold has not yet been prospectively evaluated in clinical studies, and in individual patients with severe PcP, a much lower copy number may be present. Determining beta-D-glucan in serum can also help in the differential diagnosis, because a negative result effectively rules out a diagnosis of PcP (Karageorgopoulos et al, 2013) .",

Systemic antifungal prophylaxis with a mould-active azole, such as posaconazole, also reduces the reliability of the Aspergillus GM test (Duarte et al, 2014) . A significant decline in GM OD indices was noted to result after storage of serum samples, but not BAL samples, so that the time from taking a blood sample to testing should be minimized .

PCR also appears useful for lung biopsy specimens in addition to histopathology and culture as it allows identification of the pathogen (Rickerts et al, 2007) . The lack of standardization of PCR for blood and BAL samples was the primary reason for not incorporating these assays in the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/Mycoses Study Group (MSG) definitions for invasive fungal diseases. However, progress is being made by the European Aspergillus PCR Initiative (http://www.eapcri.eu), and a cogent argument has recently been published for now including PCR in the EORTC/MSG definitions (White et al, 2015) . It also seems likely that PCR will be incorporated into diagnostic work-ups for LI alongside thoracic CT scans, serology and conventional microbiology from blood and BAL samples (White et al, 2015) . The combination of Aspergillus PCR and GM in BAL samples enhances diagnosis because the detection of both GM and PCR make the diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis highly likely, as has been confirmed by meta-analyses (Avni et al, 2012). Nonetheless, previous exposure to antifungal therapy may reduce the sensitivity of quantitative PCR assays as well as Aspergillus GM tests (McCulloch et al, 2012) .",

Updated recommendations for the treatment of documented mucormycosis are provided in evidence-based guidelines (Mousset et al, 2013; Cornely et al, 2014; Schelenz et al, 2015) . First-line treatment of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is intravenous voriconazole (6 mg/kg every 12 h day 1, 4 mg/kg every 12 h thereafter) or liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/d), while for mucormycosis (zygomycosis), liposomal amphotericin B at a dose of \u22655 mg/kg/d is preferred. Most patients need more than 7-10 d of full-dose antifungal therapy to show clinical improvement (defervescence, decreasing inflammatory parameters, declining dyspnoea, better oxygenation), whereas CT scans taken after the first week of treatment often show an increasing volume of LI (Caillot et al, 2001) . Antifungal treatment should not be changed at this point, unless new LI emerge at previously normal pulmonary sites and clinical deterioration is obvious. A second infection, immune reconstitution syndrome, infiltrates caused by the underlying malignancy or toxic side effects from cancer treatment should be revisited (Segal et al, 2008) .",
