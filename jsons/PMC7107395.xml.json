Briefly, 12 healthy male common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus; 3 years old; 230\u2013395 g) were inoculated with 5 \u00d7 106 TCID50 of MERS-CoV in 500 \u00b5L DMEM intratracheally (Figure 1). The animals were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a nonblinded manner (Table 1). Each treatment group included 3 animals. They were treated with sham treatment, MMF (CellCept, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Inc), lopinavir/ritonavir (4:1) (Kaletra, Abbot Laboratories), or recombinant interferon-\u03b21b (Betaferon, Bayer Schering Pharma, Germany) using previously described dosages [30\u201332]. We administered MMF intraperitoneally and interferon-\u03b21b subcutaneously instead of intravenously or orally, respectively, because the small veins of the common marmosets prevented reliable drug delivery through the intravenous route and because critically ill MERS patients usually require parenteral treatment. Lopinavir/ritonavir was only available in oral preparation. We initiated treatment with MMF and interferon-\u03b21b at 8 hours postinoculation (hpi) according to a previously described treatment model using MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques [21]. Treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir was started at 6 hpi as lopinavir/ritonavir takes longer to achieve its peak serum concentration (Cmax) compared with MMF and interferon-\u03b21b. The animals were observed twice daily for clinical signs and scored using a previously described clinical scoring system, which included the evaluation of the general appearance, skin and fur appearance, discharge (oral, nasal, and/or ocular), respiratory rate, and food consumption [23]. Other clinical examinations in this study included measurement of body temperature (twice daily) and body weight (0, 24, and 72 hpi), and blood collection for hematology tests (0 hpi and necropsy). Dorsal-ventral and lateral chest X-rays (CXR) were performed on anesthetized animals (0, 24, and 72 hpi) as previously described [29]. Necropsies were scheduled at 72 hpi or when the clinical score was \u226535 as previously described [21, 23]. The necropsied tissues were collected for histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and viral load studies.\n",

Briefly, total RNA and viral RNA were isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies) and Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN), respectively. After RNA quantification, 1 \u00b5g RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) using random hexamers. Total viral transcripts were detected using Novel Coronavirus 2012 Real-Time RT-PCR assay (CDC; Catalog #KT0136). The viral RNA were normalized to the messenger RNA expression level of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and a spike-in control, enterovirus 71 (strain SZ/HK08\u20135), using primers 5\u2032-GCTCACTGGCATGGCCTTCCGTGT-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGGAGGAGTGGGTGTCGCTGTTGA-3\u2032 (GAPDH), and 5\u2032-CCCCTGAATGCGGCTAATCC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032- ACACGGACACCCAAAGTAGT -3\u2032 (enterovirus 71).

Their mean clinical scores peaked at 36 hpi, at which point 2 untreated (U2 and U3) and 2 MMF-treated (M1 and M2) animals developed severe dyspnea with cyanosis, barely moved, and had blood-stained oral discharge. They were euthanized at 36 hpi as their clinical scores exceeded 35. The euthanized animals had severe hypothermia (\u226434.5\u00b0C) at necropsy, which was suggestive of severe disease with shock (Supplementary Data). CXR performed on these 4 animals prior to necropsy showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates, which were indicative of extensive pneumonia (Figure 4A and Figures 4B). The remaining untreated (U1) and MMF-treated (M3) animals survived, but continued to have severe symptoms with clinical scores \u226515 (Figure 2) and temperature \u226437.5\u00b0C, which was below their baseline levels, throughout the remaining study period (Supplementary Data).

In contrast, none of the lopinavir/ritonavir-treated and interferon-\u03b21b-treated animals developed severe symptoms. However, 1 lopinavir/ritonavir-treated (K3) animal died unexpectedly during anesthesia at 24 hpi, which was likely related to the anesthesia procedure, as common marmosets are very small and fragile. As we could not obtain ethics approval to add another animal in the study, only K1 and K2 were assessed after 24 hpi. The overall mortality rate at 36 hpi was 67% in the untreated and MMF-treated animals, and 0%\u201333% in the lopinavir/ritonavir-treated and interferon-\u03b21b-treated animals. The mean clinical score of the lopinavir/ritonavir-treated animals peaked at 24 hpi and gradually improved, whereas that of the interferon-\u03b21b-treated animals peaked at 36 hpi and then improved (Figure 2). Throughout the study, their mean clinical scores were consistently lower than those of the untreated (50.9%\u201395.0%) and MMF-treated (50.9%\u201393.3%) animals. Their temperature trend grossly correlated with their clinical scores, with the lowest temperature occurring at around 36 hpi, followed by normalization to the baseline level at 72 hpi (Supplementary Data). At 24 hpi, the lopinavir/ritonavir-treated animals had some weight loss (6.0%), which was significantly less than the untreated animals (P = .038) (Figure 3). At 72 hpi, the weight loss slightly increased to 7.5%. The interferon-\u03b21b-treated animals also had mild weight loss of 7.9% and 8.7% at 24 and 72 hpi, respectively. The lopinavir/ritonavir-treated animals had grossly normal CXR appearances, while the interferon-\u03b21b-treated animals only had mild basal interstitial infiltrate at 24 and 72 hpi (Figure 4C and Figures 4D). There were no obvious differences in the mean leukocyte, erythrocyte, and platelet counts obtained at 0 hpi and at necropsy among the 4 treatment groups (data not shown). However, changes at other time points might have been overlooked, as the small size of the animals prevented serial and frequent blood taking as described [23].\n",

            "text": "As in most other epidemics caused by emerging viruses, the de novo development of novel anti-MERS-CoV drugs has lagged behind the rapid expansion of the MERS epidemic [3]. The recent large healthcare-associated outbreak involving more than 180 infected patients and over 5000 close contacts in South Korea reemphasizes the urgent need to find effective anti-MERS-CoV treatment. Drug repurposing is an especially advantageous approach, as repurposed drugs usually have well-known pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, side effects, and dosing regimens. These data would facilitate drug use in patients with severe MERS, who often have comorbidities or are complicated by multiorgan dysfunction. However, the lack of suitable animal models has been a major obstacle to evaluating countermeasures for MERS in the past 3 years. BALB/c mice, Syrian hamsters, and ferrets are not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, while MERS-CoV-infected rhesus macaques only develop very mild and self-limiting disease [3, 21, 34\u201336]. Intranasal administration of adenoviral vectors encoding the human dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) receptor has been used to transduce and render BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice susceptible to MERS-CoV infection [37]. Using this animal model, the treatment effects of polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid and adoptive transfer of serum samples containing anti-MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein antibodies in accelerating virus clearance from the lungs were demonstrated [37]. However, the infection was relatively mild and confined to the respiratory tract. The DPP4-transgenic mouse model with more severe pulmonary and disseminated extrapulmonary disease was definitely better, but it was still not a nonhuman primate model [38]. Recently, the common marmoset model, which mimicked severe, disseminated MERS-CoV human infection, was established [23]. This is the first study to report on the use of this new nonhuman primate model for evaluating the treatment effects of repurposed drugs for MERS.",

Comparatively, our untreated animals developed symptoms and died slightly earlier than those described in Falzarano's report [23]. This might be related to the different ages of the animals (our study, 3 years; Falzarano's study, 2\u20136 years) and routes of virus inoculation. Instead of combined intranasal (8 \u00d7 105 TCID50), intratracheal (2 \u00d7 106 TCID50), conjunctival (4 \u00d7 105 TCID50), and oral (2 \u00d7 106 TCID50) inoculation (total inoculum: 5.2 \u00d7 106 TCID50), we used intratracheal inoculation (5 \u00d7 106 TCID50), which likely resulted in more direct delivery of the virus to the lower respiratory tract with faster disease onset. Nonetheless, the overall clinical, radiological, pathological, and virological findings of our untreated animals were otherwise similar to those described previously and mimicked severe MERS in humans.",

However, the immunosuppressive effects of MMF have so far limited its use in MERS patients. Compared to ribavirin, which has doubtful effects in MERS patients, MMF exhibited a much lower EC50 (MMF, 0.17 \u00b5g/mL; ribavirin, 10\u201340 \u00b5g/mL) that was markedly below its peak serum level (10\u201350 \u00b5g/mL) at routine clinical dosages [15]. It was therefore postulated that a less immunosuppressive dose of MMF could be used to treat MERS. Our primate study showed that a single dose of MMF with long half-life did not improve and might have worsened MERS-CoV infection in common marmosets. This may partially explain why renal transplant recipients on MMF still developed severe or fatal MERS [39, 40].",

Kaletra is a ritonavir-boosted lopinavir preparation, which is commonly used as an anti\u2013human immunodeficiency virus medication. Lopinavir exhibits anti-MERS-CoV activity with an EC50 of 8.0 \u00b5M in vitro, which is below its Cmax achieved after a single 500 mg oral dose of Kaletra (400 mg lopinavir/100 mg ritonavir) [17, 42]. We have previously demonstrated the in vivo treatment effects of lopinavir/ritonavir in SARS patients. Compared to control SARS patients who received ribavirin for 21 days, patients who additionally received lopinavir/ritonavir 500 mg twice daily for 14 days had milder disease with less diarrhea, recurrence of fever, lymphopenia, nosocomial infections, nasopharyngeal viral load, fecal RT-PCR positivity rate, and 21-day adverse outcome [43]. Most patients tolerated a short course of lopinavir/ritonavir well, although some experienced gastrointestinal upset, deranged liver function, headache, blurred vision, anemia, and asymptomatic bradycardia [43]. A MERS patient who received combinational lopinavir-ritonavir, pegylated interferon, and ribavirin had resolution of viremia after 2 days of treatment [44]. Our present study showed that treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir improved the clinical, radiological, and pathological features in MERS-CoV-infected common marmosets. The lopinavir/ritonavir-treated animals had the lowest mean viral loads in lung and most extrapulmonary tissues at necropsy. These findings provided further support for the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in patients with severe MERS.",

MERS-CoV is 50\u2013100 times more sensitive to pegylated interferon-\u03b1 than SARS-CoV in vitro [46]. Therefore, treatment of MERS with interferons was considered and evaluated in vitro and in a small number of patients. In Vero/Vero6 cells, interferon-\u03b21b (Betaferon) exhibited a lower EC50:Cmax ratio than interferon-\u03b12a, -\u03b12b, and -\u03b21a [15, 47]. This might partially explain why the treatment effects of interferon-\u03b12a, -\u03b12b, and -\u03b21a on the survival rates of a small cohort of MERS patients were not obvious [22, 48\u201350]. In this study, we showed that MERS-CoV-infected common marmosets treated with interferon-\u03b21b had less severe disease and lower mean viral loads in necropsied lung and extrapulmonary tissues compared with untreated animals. Notably, as the lesions in the lopinavir/ritonavir-treated and interferon-\u03b21b-treated animals were confined to 1\u20132 lobes, the overall mean viral load difference between these animals and the untreated animals were likely underestimated. Interferon-\u03b21b is commonly used to treat patients with multiple sclerosis and is usually well tolerated [32]. Rarely, monocloncal gammopathy patients treated with interferon-\u03b21b may develop systemic capillary leak syndrome [32]. Other uncommon side effects include hypersensitivity, pancreatitis, depression, cytopenia, cardiomyopathy, and liver and thyroid dysfunction [32]. Given the good safety profile of interferon-\u03b21b, and our in vitro and in vivo results, its use should be considered in clinical trials with MERS patients who have no contraindication for interferon therapy.",

            "text": "We did not evaluate the effects of combinational treatment with 2 or more drugs due to the difficulty in getting approval for using more primates. Nevertheless, the findings in this nonhuman primate study are encouraging for conducting clinical trials with MERS patients using monotherapy or combinational treatment with these repurposed drugs. The in vivo anti-MERS-CoV effects and the lack of drug interactions between lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-\u03b21b make this an attractive combination in future clinical trials. In contrast, it is still uncertain if the combination of interferon-\u03b21b and/or lopinavir/ritonavir with a lower dose of MMF may provide better viral load suppression to overcome the deleterious effects of the latter drug. Notably, the combination of MMF and interferon-\u03b21b showed synergistic effects in MERS-CoV inhibition in vitro [15]. If this combination is shown to be effective in common marmosets, it may become an alternative treatment option in patients who are intolerant to interferon-\u03b21b and/or lopinavir/ritonavir. Other potentially effective treatment regimens such as the combination of ribavirin with interferon-\u03b21b and/or lopinavir/ritonavir should also be evaluated in the common marmoset model. Although the use of high-dose ribavirin is limited by its severe side effects, low-dose ribavirin combined with interferon-\u03b21b and/or lopinavir/ritonavir may be synergistic and should still be considered. Finally, the shorter median time interval between symptom onset and death in MERS than in SARS patients emphasizes the importance of early use of these antiviral combinations in MERS. This is because MERS-CoV not only dampens the host innate interferon response, but also effectively suppresses the adaptive immune response by infection of CD3+ lymphocytes and induction of apoptosis via the both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways in a high percentage of peripheral blood and splenic lymphocytes [26]. Failure to control MERS-CoV replication during the early phase of disease may therefore lead to an impaired adaptive immune response with poor outcome.",
