The unique characteristics of polyolefins such as superior chemical resistance and robust mechanical properties, as well as low costs, make them the best candidates in single use healthcare products, medical textiles, and water filters. For example, PP has found applications in medical syringes, lab-ware applications, diagnostic devices, and Petri dishes [1]. These medical devices are usually sterilized by using sterilizing agent of irradiation before use. Thus, resistance to various chemical agents as well as to UV and other irradiation sources is necessary for medical devices. PP is the most popular polymer used in making materials for medical use such as nonwoven fabrics which are employed in liquid proofing disposable surgical and isolation gowns, drapes, central supply room sterilization wraps, face masks, and pharmaceutical filter media [2].",

Thus, polymeric surfaces and textile materials may be responsible for disease transmission and the spread of new strains of diseases from hospitals to elsewhere. In the last two decades there has been a growing concern on the emerging super infections such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which can easily spread through physical contact and aerosol transmission. Moreover, healthcare-associated infections (nosocomial effects) in hospitals are increasing, causing about 2 million cases and ranking as the fourth most common cause of death in the United States. This number accounts for up to 5% of hospitalized patients and results in $4.5 billion extra healthcare costs [5]. Use of medical devices with antimicrobial functions has been considered as a major avenue to fight against the nosocomial effects.",

The stability of foods is a function of changes occurring in the food components, such as food proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and water, due to environmental and processing factors. The use of plastics in the packaging of foods as a protective coating or barrier to contaminants not only retards unfavorable deterioration of food but may also enhance its quality [6]. Suitable packaging can slow the deterioration rate, and hence, extend the shelf-life of food. Such approaches, designed to perform some desirable function other than providing an inert barrier, have led to the concept of incorporating antimicrobial agents directly into package films, which is called active packaging. The active packaging may delay or even prevent the growth of microorganisms on the food surface and, hence, lead to an extension of the shelf-life and/or the improved safety of the food product [7].",

Antimicrobial agents have different activities which affect microorganisms differently. Antimicrobial materials can be categorized into two groups, biocidal and biostatic materials, according to their functions [8]. Biostatic functions refer to inhibiting growth of microorganisms on materials, and biostatic agents inhibit further growth of microorganisms without completely killing them. As long as the microorganism is exposed to the biostatic agent, the microorganism will not be able to reproduce rapidly. Biostatic agents can prevent the materials from biodegradation. Biocidal materials are able to kill microorganisms completely, thus eliminating their growth and possibly protecting users from biological contamination and transmission. If a biocidal agent cannot completely eradicate microorganisms because there is a limited amount, then it will only provide a biostatic effect.",

In a physical method, the antimicrobial agent could be blended with, coated or sprayed on polymeric surfaces. The physical processes are relatively simple, easy, and inexpensive to implement, but are also limited in providing desired durability and stability. Chemical approaches are able to incorporate durable and permanent antimicrobial functions to polymers by covalently linking biocides to polymer backbones. This incorporation can be carried out by copolymerization or surface grafting polymerization of biocidal structures to the polymers [9].",

Generally speaking, to provide antimicrobial functions for a certain period of time the materials should release sufficient amount of biocides during this period. Thus, controlled release of the biocides from the materials is a method of providing durable antimicrobial functions. In recent years, the authors\u2019 research group has developed a regenerable process by incorporating precursor structures of biocides onto polymers and activating the biocidal function using certain chemicals such as chlorine or oxygen bleaches [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Here, precursors or precursor structures of biocides are incorporated onto polymers with covalent bond connections. The precursor structures can be converted to biocidal sites after activation with chlorine or oxygen bleaches. The biocidal functions of the materials are regenerable after repeated usages, which is particularly important and useful for textiles.",

These antimicrobial agents have different activities against microorganisms. Some antimicrobials, such as alcohols and quaternary ammonium compounds, act directly on microbial cells to dissolve them. Others may penetrate the cells and cause the release of amino acids, nuclear material, and other important chemical constituents. Some compounds penetrate microbial cell walls and inactivate essential membrane transport systems, so that the cells can no longer obtain the nutrients necessary for them to survive and reproduce. Others coagulate certain vital materials in cells, thereby destroying the microorganisms. A few agents disrupt the metabolism of the cells, so that they can no longer assimilate nutrients; as a result, the cells starve and die.

            "text": "Among many biocides that can be blended with polyolefins, silver is the most popular one, as it is known to have strong antimicrobial effects against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, is stable and easy to apply, as well as being nontoxic to the human body [18], [19], [20], [21]. Metallic silver does not release the ion easily, compared with copper, and so its antimicrobial activity is not quite as strong as its metallic state. In fact, silver nitrate that forms silver ions, Ag+, in water solution has strong antimicrobial activity [22]. Polyolefins have poor miscibility with silver ions, thus use of micro- or nano-sized metal particles would increase miscibility of the metal in polymers. In fact, nano-sized silver particles have been introduced into polyolefins during the extrusion process [18], [19], [20], [21]. Accessibility of the silver particles inside the materials to microorganisms and low homogenous dispersion of silver nano-sized particles are the main challenges in applications of this technique [18], [21]. Moreover, the formation of Ag+ requires water uptake, so only hygroscopic polymers are good candidates in this context. Thus, addition of certain additives as a carrier for silver ions or a modifier to increase hydrophilicity of polyolefins has been proposed [23], [24]. Silver-substituted zeolites are the most widely used additives in this context for food packaging applications [7]. Based on this technology, DuPont has introduced MicroFree brand silver salt antimicrobial powders to impart antimicrobial activity to plastic resin systems.",

Since the physical trapping of the antimicrobial macromolecule is the only binding mechanism to improve miscibility of these two polymers, Lenoir and co-workers have developed a block copolymer that combines a short polyolefin block miscible with LDPE and a PTBAEMA block which has been synthesized by controlled atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) [29]. This diblock copolymer was synthesized by ATRP of TBAEMA onto poly(ethylene-co-butylene) (PEB) oligomer which has activated bromide as a macroinitiator. Morphological changes of Escherichia coli bacteria in contact with melt-blended film indicated that the diblock copolymer is bactericide rather than bacteriostatic [29]. A reasonable explanation for this claim is that some fibrous and granular material, most probably cell content, is released after 60 minutes contact time with modified LDPE which serves as evidence of the destruction of the bacteria membrane. Also, no bacteria have been observed sticking on the active surface of LDPE, which indicates that the bacteria were killed by contact and released to the aqueous environment.",

In this case, a processed polyolefin material such as nonwoven fabric or polymeric film is impregnated in a solution of antimicrobial agent, padded and dried for removal of water by heat treatment, and finally cured if necessary. Thus, only surface properties of the materials are changed while the bulk properties of the substrate are intact. Good mechanical properties of the coating and good adhesion to the substrate are critical points in the treatment of the polyolefins. In comparison to melt blending, functional coating has several advantages. For instance, after the melt blending process, most antimicrobial agents such as metal nano-sized particles may not stay on the surface and are unable to contribute to antimicrobial effects. If the agents and polyolefins are immiscible the products may not have acceptable transparency. For instance, silver nanoparticles and copper have been coated on the surface of polymer films or fabrics. To overcome low durability of the antimicrobial functions, plasma treatment with or without gas implantation was employed in coating of copper ions onto polyolefins (Table 8.4\n) [38], [39], [46].",

Therefore, durability of antimicrobial functions is much higher than with physical incorporation techniques, though cleavage of immobilized antimicrobial agent is the most critical point. This method of obtaining antimicrobial polymers requires the presence of suitable functional groups on both the antimicrobial and the polymer. Peptides, enzymes, and polyamines are the functional-bearing antimicrobial agents. Few examples of immobilization of antimicrobial onto unmodified polyolefins have been published because of nonavailability of suitable functional groups on the polyolefin polymers. Therefore, most research efforts have focused on introducing functional groups onto the polymers.",

N-halamine compounds provide the most durable and rechargeable biocidal properties compared to other antimicrobial agents. Several efforts have been devoted to incorporating them into polymeric materials in the last 10 years [10], [11], [12], [13], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66]. Blending an N-halamine agent with polymeric material and grafting on polymer backbone are the most common ways to introduce N-halamine agents into polymeric structures.
