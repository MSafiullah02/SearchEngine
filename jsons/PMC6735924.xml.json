            "text": "The standard method for rapidly detecting known human viruses in clinical samples is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in which short oligonucleotides are used to amplify and probe specific regions of viral genomes. The limitations of this technique include the targeting of a relatively small number of viruses per assay and a dependence on sequence conservation among viral strains. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) provides approaches to viral diagnosis that have much greater scope. Thus, metagenomic analysis of HTS data can provide extensive viral genotyping information, as well as the characterization of complex multiple infections (Thorburn et al. 2015). Several metagenomic pipelines using de novo assembly and homology matching have been developed for virus detection (Wang, Jia, and Zhao 2013; Scheuch, H\u00f6per, and Beer 2015; Li et al. 2016; Ren et al. 2017; Zheng et al. 2017; Maarala et al. 2018). However, analyzing HTS data using such approaches brings heavy computing and bioinformatic demands that are difficult to meet and standardize in diagnostic laboratories (Flygare et al. 2016). As a consequence, we have developed DisCVR, which is a fast, accurate and easy-to-use tool for detecting known human viruses in clinical samples.",

It works by creating a database of short nucleotide sequences (k-mers) from a large set of viral reference sequences, tagging the k-mers taxonomically according to the viruses from which they came, screening each read in the HTS dataset for the presence of virus k-mers, and organizing a summary of the viruses present in the sample via the tags. This approach makes data analysis very efficient, thereby minimizing the computing effort required (Orton et al. 2016).",

            "text": "Several existing tools utilize the abundance-based method to classify the reads in an HTS dataset. Naive Bayes Classification (Rosen, Reichenberger, and Rosenfeld 2011) employs a na\u00efve Bayesian classifier to assign a log-likelihood score to each read. This classifier is trained by using a set of unique profiles of fifteen nucleotide k-mers from microbial genomes, and then allows users to upload the dataset to a web site and obtain a summary of results listing the best taxonomic match for each read. Kraken (Wood and Salzberg 2014) assigns each k-mer in the database to the last common ancestor of species having that k-mer, and then assigns each read to the taxon with the most matching k-mers. CoMeta (Kawulok and Deorowicz 2015) creates a database of all k-mers for each rank in the taxonomic tree, and then uses these databases to classify the reads at each rank. CLARK (Ounit et al. 2015) collects target-specific k-mer sets from reference genomes belonging to a certain taxonomic rank (e.g. genus), and then classifies reads at that rank. This approach reduces the database size but requires a different database to be built for each rank. To improve the accuracy of the classification, CSSSCL (Borozan and Ferretti 2016) creates a BLAST database, a k-mer database and a compression database from a collection of reference genomes. Sequences in the sample are classified according to a combined sequence similarity score (CSSS) (Borozan, Watt, and Ferretti 2015) calculated from information in the pre-computed databases. In contrast to Kraken, CLARK, and CoMeta, all of which assign individual reads, MetaPalette (Koslicki and Falush 2016) profiles the entire dataset and returns the relative proportions of organisms present by using k-mer sizes of 30 and 50, based on the rationale that using two different k-mer sizes allows strain-level variation to be captured more accurately. Taxonomer (Flygare et al. 2016) compares each read to multiple reference databases, assigning it to a high-level taxonomic category on the basis of the k-mer content of the read, and then uses exact k-mer matching to assign each read to a reference by maximizing the total k-mer weight. This weight, which is a function of the k-mer count in the reference and the database, provides a database-specific measure of how likely it is that a k-mer originated from a particular reference sequence.",

The databases are built using a limited set of reference sequences and therefore are of restricted utility for classifying organisms with sequences that diverge from the reference. This limitation can be a particular problem when significant variation exists in an organism at strain level. It can be addressed by incorporating a range of variants into the database, but this creates a much larger database that may make the analysis challenging to run on resource-limited computers. Furthermore, many of the current tools are run on Linux systems and hence require the operator to have expertise in command line usage and an understanding of bioinformatics, which may be difficult to find in diagnostic settings. To our knowledge, the only tool that has been developed for ease of use and for application on computers with limited resources is Truffle (Visser, Burger, and Maree 2016). This is designed to screen for a limited set of user-specified viruses, comes preloaded with probe-sets for grapevine viruses, and cannot easily be updated for large sets of viruses from other hosts.",

It is optimized to run on Windows, Linux and Mac OS, using minimal RAM and processing power without compromising speed and accuracy. The tool currently integrates curated viral databases at the taxonomic levels of species and strain, but may be used to build a customized database at any taxonomic level, thereby overcoming the limitations of using a restricted set of reference sequences.

KAnalyze (Audano and Vannberg 2014) was chosen for integration into DisCVR because the k-mers it generates are sorted lexicographically, thus making the search for matches very efficient. KAnalyze also uses the canonical representation of a k-mer, which is lexicographically the smaller of a k-mer and its reverse complement. These features allow the program to work with 3 Gb RAM.",

A shared k-mer is defined as a k-mer that is common to a virus and the host. By excluding shared k-mers, it is not necessary for the user to remove host reads before using DisCVR, thus speeding up the overall processing time. If k is small, many copies of shared k-mers are generated, and if k is large, many copies of virus k-mers are found. Choosing the optimal k-mer size depends on balancing the advantages of speed (small k) with those of specificity and sensitivity (large k). Furthermore, it is necessary to reduce the number of low-complexity k-mers in the virus k-mer database, as these may be repetitive in sequence and present in otherwise unrelated viruses. The filtering of low-complexity k-mers and the selection of the size of k is explained in Supplementary Section S1 (Shannon 1948; Sims et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2009).",

In addition, some of the sequences in these datasets, defined largely by their presence in the NCBI RefSeq database, are used as a set of reference genome sequences in the validation module. DisCVR also allows the user to create customized databases and sets of reference sequences using the command-line utility scripts provided with the DisCVR distribution. The database build module involves selecting the relevant viral dataset, collecting the k-mers, and removing those that are shared with the host or are of low complexity. Each remaining k-mer is then identified with a taxonomic tag and an indication of the number of times it occurs in the sequences. The k-mers are further subdivided into those that exist in a single virus (i.e. specific k-mers) and those that exist in multiple viruses (i.e. nonspecific k-mers). These assignments are made at the level of species and strain and are used in the output to illustrate the degree of specificity of the k-mers matching a virus (Fig. 2).\n",

The k-mers are extracted and their frequencies are calculated, the single copy k-mers, which are mainly attributed to sequencing errors (Manekar and Sathe 2018), and low-complexity k-mers, which commonly give confounding matches that have nothing to do with homology (Altschul et al. 1994), are filtered out, and the remaining k-mers are compared with the chosen virus k-mer database. As the number of k-mers in the sample can be enormous, various data structures were considered to optimize the classification on machines with limited RAM. Although searching the trie is fast O(n), where n is the size of the k-mer, it requires O(n2) overall time to build, and the space needed is quadratic. Instead, DisCVR uses a fast searching algorithm that groups similar k-mers together. Briefly, the k-mers in the virus database are divided among smaller sub-files according to the first five nucleotides. The same procedure is used to divide the k-mers derived from the entire HTS dataset. Searching commences by loading the corresponding sub-files from the virus k-mer database and the sample k-mers into memory, and performing a binary search for the presence of each sample k-mer among the database k-mers. Only matched k-mers are retrieved. Finally, DisCVR displays a straightforward list of all the virus hits detected, along with summary statistics and taxonomic information on the sample k-mers (Fig. 2).",

            "text": "The RT-PCR assay was limited by the range of viruses that it could detect, by its dependence on sequence conservation, and consequently also by its potential to identify infections by multiple viruses. Consequently, the false positive results were assessed using the validation module (Table 2), and the false negative results were investigated by examining the second hits recorded by DisCVR (Table 1). In most false positive cases, the validation module showed that there were multiple reads mapping (mean = 98 \u00b1 73 reads) to several regions of the reference genome (mean = 6 \u00b1 1% coverage of sites), thus confirming the presence of the viruses identified by DisCVR even though they had not been detected by RT-PCR. Some samples had low coverage because a single RefSeq sequence in the validation represented the entire species but diverged in sequence from the virus present in the sample. For example, sample 1B3 yielded HRV-A89 (the reference for species Rhinovirus A) as the top hit, with only 7.6 per cent genome coverage and four mapped reads. Using the capability of DisCVR to build a customized database drawn from the \u2265100 prototypic strains of Rhinovirus A, HRV-A49 was revealed as the top hit, with 81.71 per cent genome coverage and 263 mapped reads. This dramatic improvement illustrates the potential to strengthen the validation module by adding user-specific curated sets of sequences or by the proposed expansion of RefSeq entries capturing a greater degree of diversity (Brister et al. 2015). In the sixteen false negative cases, DisCVR detected the virus identified by RT-PCR as the top hit in three samples (1G2, 1I5, and 2B6), but the number of distinct k-mers was <850 (Table 1; Supplementary Table S2). In addition, the virus identified by RT-PCR was detected as the second hit in 10 samples (1B5, 1D3, 1E5, 1G1, 1F7, 1F8, 2A2, 2B9, 2C4, and 2D3), and, in one case (1C2), the RT-PCR assay did not have the potential of identifying the top hit (enterovirus D). An important finding was made in two of these samples (1B5 and 1D3), in which the viruses detected by RT-PCR were not the top hits but still had \u2265850 distinct k-mers in the sample (Table 1). This suggests that these patients were infected by multiple viruses. Finally, DisCVR did not detect any k-mers for the virus detected by RT-PCR in two samples (1C9 and 2D4), but identified HRV-A in 1C9, which was validated by reference assembly. The validation module thus yielded strong evidence for the presence of the viruses detected by DisCVR, at least where the number of k-mers was \u2265850. These findings were taken into account in reassessing the sensitivity and specificity of DisCVR at 79 and 100 per cent, respectively (Fig. 4). The optimal threshold for CLARK and Kraken based on the ROC curves suggests 150 reads as the threshold. Recalculating the sensitivity and specificity based on this threshold gave values of 70.7 and 91.7 per cent for CLARK and 68.7 and 76 per cent for Kraken.",

However, the uptake of HTS in such settings has been slow, due partly to the cost, turnover time and bioinformatic demands of this technology. We developed DisCVR to help address these challenges. DisCVR is a fast, accurate program for detecting viruses from HTS data using the increasingly exploited approach of k-mer classification. It offers the advantage of a non-targeted approach and also enables typing below the species level (e.g. subtype, serotype, genotype, or strain). Unlike other tools for detecting viruses from HTS data, DisCVR is easy to use in diagnostic settings through the GUI, requires no bioinformatic expertise, and can be used on the Windows operating systems that are commonly used in diagnostic laboratories. The basic output is easy to interpret, and the advanced output provides more detailed statistics and a validation capability.",

Indeed, the paper on the Nigerian patients (Stremlau et al. 2015) reported novel rhabdoviruses in healthy patients using a metagenomic approach, and these were not detected by DisCVR. However, metagenomics requires bioinformatic infrastructure and expertise at levels that are not commonly available in diagnostic laboratories. Nonetheless, DisCVR enables the detection of 148 pathogenic human viruses using one of the three implemented datasets (the pathogenic dataset), and more using the others. This represents a greater than ten-fold increase in target species over multiplex RT-PCR. Moreover, the number of viruses incorporated into the DisCVR databases is flexible and can also be expanded by building custom databases.",

This threshold may be set by the user and was calculated for the respiratory dataset for which we had paired RT-PCR and HTS data. As more datasets with paired information become available, it will be possible to tune the threshold more accurately to specific sample types and sizes. For example, the coverage depth of sequencing data is likely to play an important role in the threshold of detection. Further efforts could also be made to calibrate DisCVR from artificially constructed communities of viruses in various proportions.",
