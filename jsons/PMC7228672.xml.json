Indeed, there was a higher mortality rate in the northern region where fewer patients could be admitted into an ICU. These preliminary data evidence the pivotal preventive role played by early lockdown measures to reduce outbreak magnitude and place less pressure on ICU beds availability; however, these data should be interpreted with caution because of possible bias: patients could be allowed outside the ICU due to various reasons (i.e., age, comorbidities, frailty index), as it occurs in daily clinical practice.",
