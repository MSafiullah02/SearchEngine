            "text": "The antiviral activities of isatin derivatives have been widely reported, especially their action against pox virus [1], vaccinia [2], rhino virus [3], Moloney leukemia virus [4], and SARS virus [5]. Previous works have also reported the inhibitory activity of isatin-thiosemicarbazones and isatin derivatives on HIV replication [6\u20138]. In addition, methisazone (an isatin-thiosemicarbazone) plays an important role as a prophylactic agent against several viral diseases [9]. There has been increasing interest in recent years concerning the introduction of fluorine into organic compounds [10, 11]. Incorporation of one or several fluorine atoms into an organic molecule can improve the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties such as absorption, tissue distribution, secretion, the route and rate of biotransformation, toxicology, bioavailability, metabolic stability, and lipophilicity [12, 13]. Many of the compounds containing a fluorine atom have a significant therapeutic impact. Fluorinated isatin derivatives have become a focus in the development of new biologically active compounds [14].",

No positive activities were noticed in the other tested samples among the series of tested structure. Compound 10b, which has a 4-fluorophenyl moiety, showed the highest activity among compounds 10 against replication of VSV with a log virus titer difference of 0.90; when this moiety was replaced by a 4-dimethylphenyl moiety, as in the case of compound 10c, the activity decreased and showed a log virus titer difference of 0.68. Compounds 10e and 11 exhibited weak activity, whereas the other tested compounds showed no positive antiviral activity. In pharmacological terms, the presence of the 4-fluorophenyl moiety on the skeleton of structure 10 may be directly responsible for its antiviral activity, whereas the presence of the allyl moiety in compound 7c makes it a promising antiviral agent.",

A negative cell control was included. Plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. Cell culture-treated plates were microscopically examined using an inverted microscope for detection of cellular changes. The test compounds treatment medium was discarded. Plates were washed using PBS. Cell viability was evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT).

Each dilution was dispensed as 100 mm3/well onto preculture Vero cells. Plates were inoculated using 10 CCID50 of VSV isolate tested. Plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C. Seven days post infection the 50 % end point (CCID50) was determined. Antiviral activity was determined by subtracting the VSV mean titer in the treated and non-treated cell titers.
