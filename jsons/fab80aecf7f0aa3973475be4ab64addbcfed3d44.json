An individual is test-positive or test-negative accordingly if they took a test for a disease but tested positive or tested negative. Adding a control group to a comparison of testpositives vs test-negatives is useful since additional comparison of test-positives vs controls can have potential biases different from the first comparison. Bonferroni correction ensures necessary type-I error control for these two comparisons done simultaneously. We propose two new methods for inference which have better interpretability and higher statistical power for these designs. These methods add a third comparison that is essentially independent of the first comparison, but our proposed second method often pays much less for these three comparisons than what a Bonferroni correction would pay for the two comparisons.",

It is important to distinguish new evidence from the same evidence repeated twice. 3 To this end, it is useful to supplement comparisons (i)-(ii) with comparison (iii) test-positives pooled with test-negatives to controls, which is essentially independent of (i) -see Figure 1B and supplement -and may suffer from different potential biases than (i). 1 For example, it has been hypothesized that smoking protects against Covid-19. 2 Comparison (i) may be biased because test-negatives may have some other infection (e.g., the flu) for which smoking increases risk and comparisons (ii) and (iii) may be biased because test-takers tend to be \"health seeking.\" 7 Finding evidence of smoking being protective in all comparisons (i)-(iii) would strengthen evidence compared to just comparisons (i)-(ii) in part because the latter comparisons are dependent.",

Two plots in Panel C show the simulated powers of three different methods of analyses of TNSWAC, calculated from 10,000 simulated instances. One simulated study consists of 1,250 individuals of, on average, 40% controls, 30% test-negatives and 30% test-positives. Under the null, in Panel A and B, the frequency of an exposure is constant 20% in each of these three groups. In panel C, the odds ratio of an exposure is 1.75 for test-positives versus controls and the odds ratio of an exposure is 1.75 for test-positives versus test-negatives.

In the following P (i) , P (ii) and P (iii) correspond to the three p-values calculated for these hypotheses from the corresponding comparisons.In this setup a method provides a level \u03b1 familywise error rate control if the probability of rejecting any true null hypothesis among the three null hypotheses is at most \u03b1. In the following we let R S denote the event that at least one of the nulls are rejected among {H 0s : s \u2208 S} where S \u2286 {(i), (ii), (iii)}.
