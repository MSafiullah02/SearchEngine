Other diseases are expected to be eradicated in the short term, including poliomyelitis. Despite these outstanding benefits derived from vaccination, many obstacles in the development and deployment of novel or improved vaccines remain (Sheerin et al. 2017 ). Most of the currently used vaccines are based on whole microorganisms or viruses in attenuated or killed forms. Although these vaccines possess high immunogenicity and efficacy, some aspects could be improved such as better reactogenicity and reduction of the risk of developing the disease in some population groups (e.g., immunocompromised individuals). The development of safer vaccines can be achieved by generating subunit vaccines, which are formulated with a few antigenic components from the pathogen. One of the challenges to address in this regard is the poor immunogenicity of the individual antigens, which is a frequent issue due to their low molecular complexity and absence of PAMPs in the formulation to stimulate innate immunity mechanisms that subsequently trigger the induction of adaptive immune responses. Therefore, the inclusion of adjuvants in the subunit vaccine formulations is needed to achieve induction of strong and protective immune responses (Bastola et al. 2017) .",

However, the most highlighted application in this sense is the production of virus-like particles (VLPs), which are multimeric protein complexes that resemble a virus lacking genetic material. Thus, they are unable to replicate or cause the disease, but retain the immunogenic activity since they mimic the virus in shape, size, and surface antigenic determinants. The high immunogenicity of VLPs could avoid the need of accessory adjuvants (Charlton Hume et al. 2019) . In fact, some VLPs have been used as immunostimulants able to mediate protection against some diseases without the use of specific antigens, which is attributed to the activation of innate immune system mechanisms (Wiley et al. 2009 ). The interaction of VLPs with the innate immune system is of major importance for the induction of adaptive immune responses. The innate immune cells recognize and interact with VLPs on the basis of two major characteristics: size and surface geometry (Mohsen et al. 2018) .",

Moreover, several VLPs-based vaccines candidates are currently under clinical evaluation in schemes comprising parenteral administration; these include vaccines against Norovirus (Leroux-Roels et al. 2018) , malaria (Chichester et al. 2018) , and influenza (Pillet et al. 2018) . The present chapter is rather focused on the vaccines evaluated in mucosal immunization schemes since these are simple and safe immunization modes that could also lead to substantial savings in the cost of vaccination campaigns since no trained personnel or sterile devices are required. In fact, the formulation of oral or nasal vaccines based on dried formulations may avoid the use of cold chain distribution, which is the most practical way to expand vaccination coverage in developing countries at low cost. Moreover, nasal and oral immunization allows inducing attractive immune responses. For instance, the nasal route has been shown to be superior to parenteral administration for VLPs-based vaccines at eliciting IgA at distal mucosal sites, which is critical to protect the port of entry of most of the pathogens. The oral route, under optimal schemes, induces IgA intestinal responses that protect against intestinal pathogens and also provides systemic humoral responses (Nardelli-Haefliger et al. 1999; Buonaguro et al. 2005) .",

This formulation deserves improvement, for instance, replacing attenuated virus by inactivated virus or VLPs could reduce the risk for immunocompromised individuals to develop the disease (Tamura et al. 2016 ). In the case of oral vaccines, the oral polio vaccine based on attenuated virus has been used for decades contributing to the decline of poliomyelitis cases; nonetheless the emergence of poliomyelitis cases caused by vaccine-derived strains has been reported (Bandyopadhyay et al. 2015) . The oral vaccine against cholera is another example of the few mucosal vaccines approved for human use.

This process can occur in vivo or in vitro. Expression of VLP-forming proteins is performed in a genetically engineered host that includes bacteria, yeast, insect cells, plant cells, and mammalian cells. The choice of the host basically depends on the cost and requirements in terms of post-translational modifications (Fuenmayor et al. 2017) . For instance, glycosylation may impact the VLPs immunogenicity; it has been reported that mannosylation enhances the uptake of VLPs by antigen presenting cells (Al-Barwani et al. 2014) . The case of VLPs resembling enveloped virus typically requires the use of mammalian cell lines as these possess the cellular machinery to properly produce such particles. VLPs resembling phages are naturally and efficiently expressed in recombinant E. coli, which is a low-cost system when compared to insect or mammalian cells. Plants have also been used as low-cost expression platforms to efficiently produce not only VLPs derived from plant viruses, but VLPs resembling mammalian viruses and even enveloped viruses (Pillet et al. 2018) .",

VLPs can be assembled in vivo resembling the viral assembly, but can also be assembled in vitro (either spontaneously or induced by changes in pH and salinity) after purification of the VLP-forming protein. In many cases, the VLP-forming protein is the vaccine antigen itself; thus the VLPs-based vaccine is obtained in a straightforward manner. In other cases, the VLP from a specific virus is used as scaffold to display unrelated antigens from the target pathogen. In this case, there are basically two methodologies to address this objective: genetic fusion and chemical coupling. The former consists in designing chimeric VLPs comprising the VLP-forming protein and the unrelated antigen. The site for the insertion of the foreign protein sequence should be selected properly to avoid alterations in the assembly properties of the scaffold protein and allow displaying the foreign antigen. In some cases, limitations in the length of the foreign protein exist and this should be considered during VLP design. The fusion gene is generated and expressed in the proper host and the resulting VLPs generally display the unrelated antigen on the surface. In this way, the chimeric VLP serves as a carrier of unrelated epitopes, which offers the possibility of producing multivalent vaccines by including several epitopes in the chimeric protein (Wu et al. 2019; Kingston et al. 2019) .",

Phages and their proteins can be efficiently produced in recombinant bacteria at low and rapid processes. For instance, VLPs derived from the bacteriophage Q\u03b2 have been used as carriers of unrelated antigens (synthetic peptides) that are displayed in a repetitive fashion on their surface. Coupling of peptides and VLPs is typically based on using heterobifunctional linkers using a two-step conjugation scheme. Another reported approach consisted in substituting methionine residues in VLPs with analogues containing terminal azide (azidohomoalanine: AHA) and alkyne (homoproparglyglycine: HPG) groups. Azide and alkyne functionalized small molecules and proteins are subsequently coupled to VLPs using click chemistry (Strable et al. 2008) . The obtained Q\u03b2 VLPs are highly immunogenic in mice (Lechner et al. 2002) and humans (Maurer et al. 2005) . Interestingly, since RNA from the host (E. coli) is captured inside VLPs during assembly, it serves as adjuvant acting as Toll-like receptor ligand, enhancing the vaccine efficacy especially for the induction of IgG2a/c-dominated antibody responses (Forsbach et al. 2007 ). Besides antigenic peptides, Q\u03b2 VLPs have been used also as carriers of carbohydrate epitopes and nicotine for the development of vaccines against Leishmania infection and tobacco dependence, respectively (Moura et al. 2017; Maurer and Bachmann 2007) . Interestingly, Bessa et al. (2008) demonstrated no differences in Fig. 10 .1 Representation of the strategies to produce VLPs useful in vaccine development. The VLP-forming protein is obtained by heterologous expression in an appropriate host (e.g., bacteria, yeasts, plant cells, and insect cells). VLPs can be assembled in vivo or in vitro after purifying the VLP-forming protein in its monomeric form. Genetic modification allows producing chimeric VLP that display unrelated antigens, making possible the production of bi or multivalent vaccines (I). Conjugation approaches allow the covalent attachment of unrelated epitopes (synthetic peptides) onto the VLP surface (II) the efficacy of Q\u03b2-specific systemic IgG and IgA responses following subcutaneous versus intranasal immunization, which augurs an interesting potential for the development of mucosal nanovaccines.",

Another approach consists in genetically fusing immunostimulatory signals to VLPs.

            "text": "The influenza virus is a serious threat to global health leading to a high economic burden. Since this pathogen mutates continuously, the new variants evade preexisting immunity and thus new vaccines are required that in addition must be produced in a short time. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic and human cases of H5N1 and H7N9 indicate the great need for platforms able to result in effective vaccines in a short time (Chen et al. 2014) . Lee et al. (2018) explored the potential of using VLPs based on the M1 matrix protein and a tandem repeat of M2 ectodomains (M2e5x) derived from the human, swine, Avian 1, and Avian 2 influenza viruses as an approach to induce broad cross-protection against influenza virus strains variants. The insect cell-made VLPs were administered to mice i.n. (dose: 15 \u03bcg of M2e5x VLP total proteins, 0.9 \u03bcg M2e5x proteins) and boosting was performed at week 4. Animals were challenged with either the A/Phil (H3N2) or A/Viet (rgH5N1) virus. M2e5x VLPs reduced weight loss, attenuated inflammatory cytokines and cellular infiltrates, decreased viral loads, and induced germinal center phenotypic B and plasma cells. The vaccine induced M2-specific antibodies in sera and mucosal tissues, conferring effective cross-protection against heterosubtypic influenza viruses. A balanced Th2/Th1 response was evident according to measurements of IgG2a and IgG1. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells had a role in the observed protective effects. Configurations for genetically modified VLPs useful in vaccine production. Virus-like particles can be genetically modified to incorporate peptide and protein antigens (in red) by genetic fusion to the C/N-termini or in the flexible loop regions of the VLP-forming protein (blue). Accessory adjuvant protein sequences, such as LTB and Flic, can be also attached (yellow) to enhance the immunogenicity of the particle. These strategies allow obtaining VLPs with an exact placement of the target antigen within the final particle, having a defined number of target antigen molecules per particle Patterson et al. (2013) reported a vaccine based on P22 VLPs obtained by coexpressing in E. coli the P22 coat protein with either a truncated version of the NP antigen (NP 163 ) or the full length NP, which was fused to the truncated scaffold (SP). VLPs carrying either NP versions were i.n. administered to mice daily for 5 days (dose: 100 \u03bcg of P22 VLPs). Both vaccine versions were able to induce strong protective immune responses in mice against a challenge with either the H1N1 or H3N2 influenza viruses. The protective response was in part attributed to an NP-specific CD8+ T lymphocyte response. In terms of humoral responses, the full length NP-based vaccine induced anti-NP antibodies, whereas the truncated NP did not. These data correlated with a lower protection rate in mice immunized with the truncated NP-based vaccine. According to the results, the reported vaccine is a potential candidate not requiring accessory adjuvants to achieve protection.",

            "text": "Another VLPs-based influenza vaccine candidate has been proposed by Nerome et al. (2017) , which was produced by expressing the H7 influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) in silkworm pupae. Mice were orally immunized with HA VLPs in different schemes comprising two (with 1 month or 1-week interval) or three immunizations (with a 1-week interval). A two-dose i.p. scheme was also employed. Chickens were immunized three times orally with 16,384 HA titers of H7 VLP or H5-Fukushima VLP. HA VLPs showed positive immunoreactivity with the authentic anti-H7 antibodies. H5 and H7 VLPs triggered humoral responses in chickens and mice upon oral immunization. The antibodies elicited upon oral immunization were confirmed by fluorescent antibody analysis and Western blotting in Korea H5-BmNPV and H7 HA-BmNPV recombinant infected BmN cells. No challenge experiments were reported. This platform is advantageous as it would allow for large-scale production of the vaccine at relatively low costs since the use of expensive culture media, required for insect cells in culture, is avoided. Ren et al. (2018) explored the idea of producing influenza VLPs decorated with membrane-anchored forms of the E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit protein (LTB) or the Toll-like receptor 5 ligand flagellin (Flic) as accessory mucosal adjuvants. For this purpose, H5N1 VLPs (composed of the viral HA, NA, and M1 proteins) were produced in insect cells (Fig. 10.3 ). Mice were subjected to three weekly doses of VLPs (100 \u03bcg) administered by i.m. or oral routes. VLPs containing LTB or Flic generated higher humoral and cellular immune responses than plain influenza VLPs. Intramuscular immunization with plant VLPs, VLPs-CTB, or VLPs-Flic protected mice from a lethal challenge with homologous or heterologous H5N1 viruses. In contrast, in orally immunized mice only VLPs-LTB and VLPs-Flic conferred substantial protection against a lethal challenge with both homologous and heterologous H5N1 influenza viruses (40% of survival rate), whereas mice immunized with plain VLPs succumbed to infection (Fig. 10.4) . Mice immunized orally with LTB-or Flic-VLPs showed tenfold higher virus-specific IgG titers than mice immunized with plain VLPs. Thus, these accessory adjuvants are promising tools that can be applied in the development of vaccines against other pathogens. Wang et al. (2010) used insect cell-made VLPs consisting of the HA and M1 proteins plus Flic (HA/Flic/M1 cVLPs) or M1 plus flagellin (Flic/M1 cVLPs). The authors previously proved that Flic inclusion in the VLPs allowed protecting mice, i.m. immunized, from a challenge with a heterosubtypic strain. In this study, mice were i.n. immunized twice with 10 \u03bcg of VLPs at 4-week interval. HA/Flic/M1 cVLPs induced robust cellular responses and enhanced systemic and mucosal antibody responses when compared to plain influenza VLPs; moreover, the vaccine provided full protection against a challenge with either homologous or heterosubtypic viruses. Plain VLPs did not induce protection upon heterosubtypic challenge. Upon co-administration with plain VLPs, soluble flagellin exhibited a moderate adjuvant effect evidenced by an enhancement of systemic and mucosal responses and partial heterosubtypic protection.",

Either of the test adjuvants provided full protection, whereas unadjuvanted vaccines led to lower protection rate. The i.n. vaccine resulted in partial protection against a lethal challenge with a heterologous H1N1 virus (Fig. 10.7 ).",

            "text": "An immunization approach against influenza based on VLPs was described by Bessa et al. (2008) . The authors produced VLPs derived from the Q\u03b2 phage (E. coliproduced); plain or functionalized with the influenza virus derived ectodomain of the M2 protein (VLPs-M2, for humoral responses induction) or the p33 peptide (VLPs-p33), which is the major CTL epitope of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (as a model CTL epitope). The latter conjugate contained CpG as an accessory adjuvant. Mice were i.n. or s.c. immunized with plain VLPs or VLPs-M2, with the latter inducing strong IgG responses in serum and lung and IgA in serum. Only mice Aichi or Philippines. A weight loss higher than 25% was used as endpoint at which mice were euthanized according to IACUC guidelines. Changes in body weight are displayed as the mean, representative of one experiment. The survival differences were evaluated by the log-rank Mantel-Cox test (n = 5) (Taken from Mohsen et al. 2017) immunized i.n. induced IgA production in the lung and a large numbers of germinal centers (GC), as well as memory B-cells in the spleen and plasma cells in the bone marrow. i.n. immunization with VLPs-M2 also provided significant protection against an i.n. challenge with a lethal dose (4 \u00d7 LD50) of the influenza virus strain PR8. In contrast, i.n. immunization with VLP-p33 induced relatively inefficient cytotoxic T-cell responses, resulting in low numbers of specific T-cells and poor effector cell differentiation. This report supports the use of Q\u03b2 phage for nasal vaccine production. Surprisingly since the publication of this report no additional efforts have been reported to apply Q\u03b2 phage in the development of vaccines against relevant pathogens, especially those for which humoral responses are critical for protection. An outstanding approach for oral vaccination has been recently reported by Serradell et al. (2019) , which consists in producing VLPs based on the murine leukemia virus (MLV) capsid protein Gag, variant specific surface proteins (VSPs) from Giardia lamblia, and surface antigens such as the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins fused to the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail of the G protein from the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). The VLPs produced in HEK293 cells were orally or s.c. administered to mice four times at a 1-week interval (100 \u03bcg dose for oral and 10 \u03bcg for s.c. immunization). This strategy allowed displaying on the VLP surface both HA and VSP. The latter was shown to protect VLPs from degradation and activate APC using in vitro assays. Orally administered VLPs-VSPs, but not plain VLPs (expressing HA only), generated robust immune responses in terms of serum IgG1 and IgG2a and IgA in feces and bronchoalveolar lavage. When VLPs-VSPs were administered parenterally; they showed superior immunogenicity with respect to plain VLPs, but did not induce mucosal humoral responses. Interestingly, VLPs-VSPs induced full protection against an influenza virus challenge, whereas plain VLPs did not. The authors also challenged mice with murine AB1 malignant mesothelioma cells expressing HA, observing that VLPs-VSPs controlled tumor growth almost completely. Further analysis confirmed that VLPs-VSPs induced robust IFN-\u03b3 T-cell responses and in vitro cytotoxicity against the tumor cells ( Fig. 10.8) . This is an outstanding approach offering a promising path for the development of oral vaccines not requiring adjuvants. Ten days after immunization with H5N1 VLPs, mice were i.n. challenged with a mouse-adapted influenza virus, n = 5. A Kaplan-Meier life survival curve analysis was performed using the logrank Mantel-Cox method for curve comparison analysis (a). Body weight is presented as percentage of the initial average weight registered at day 0. Changes in body weight were evaluated for 2 weeks (b). (c, d) Ten days after the last immunization, mice immunized with H1N1 VLPs were injected with AB1-HA tumor cells. The tumor volume growth is reported from two independent experiments, n = 8 (c). After tumors harvesting and weighing (31 days after tumor inoculation), representative tumor photographs are shown from two independent experiments, n = 8 (d).

Mice were i.n. or i.m. immunized with VLPs (single dose: 10 \u03bcg or 30 \u03bcg) or inactivated RSV (2 \u00d7 10 6 pfu/mouse for i.n. and FI-RSV at a dose of 1.875 mg/mouse for i.m.). VLPs presented a positive immunoreactivity and function when compared to the RSV virion in vitro. The i.n. administered vaccine induced Th1 polarized response and effective mucosal virus-neutralizing antibody and CD8+ T-cell responses at both mucosal and systemic levels, whereas i.m. immunization only induced effective response at the systemic level. Upon a challenge with RSV, i.n. immunized mice showed increased viral clearance, but decreased signs of enhanced lung pathology and fewer eosinophils when compared to mice immunized with formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV). i.n. administered VLPs induced a response that lasted up to 15 months. Therefore, this approach is promising for developing an effective and safe mucosal vaccine against RSV infection, although production in mammalian cells is costly when compared to other systems (e.g., bacteria, yeast, or plant cells).

The SARS VLP vaccine at the 0.8 \u03bcg dose completely protected mice when i.m. or i.n. administered. The SARS VLP vaccine (4 \u03bcg dose) without adjuvant reduced lung virus titer below detectable levels, protected mice from weight loss, and elicited a high level of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV. Soluble SARS S protein was also protective but only when i.m. administered along with aluminum hydroxide. Since this vaccine was produced under the same procedures followed for the production of an influenza VLP vaccine successfully evaluated in phase I and phase II clinical studies, the authors propose this as a platform of facile implementation allowing a rapid vaccine production in case of a SARS pandemic.",

Plant-made VLPs for use in immunization against Norwalk virus are highly cost-attractive, but have shown low immunogenic potential. Looking to enhance the efficacy of this vaccine, some approaches have been explored. VLPs based on the NV ORF2 (without ORF3) expressed in plants (N. benthamiana) have been applied by Jackson and Herbst-Kralovetz (2012) using i.n. immunization schemes to determine the effect of various adjuvants (Murabutide, MB, an adjuvant that targets the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) receptor; gardiquimod, GARD, which is a TLR7 agonist; and the cholera toxin, CT, a well-known mucosal adjuvant). Mice were i.n. immunized twice at 3-week intervals with VLPs (25 \u03bcg) alone or supplemented with one of the following: MB (levels: 25, 100, or 250 \u03bcg), GARD (25 \u03bcg), or CT (1 \u03bcg). MB showed the optimal adjuvant effect when coadministered at a 100 \u03bcg dose, based on the magnitude of VLP-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgA production in serum and VLP-specific IgA production at distal mucosal sites. i.n. vaccination using VLPs with MB induced humoral responses in similar magnitudes to those achieved by i.n. co-administration of VLPs and CT or GARD and i.m. immunization with VLP plus alum. Interestingly in terms of the induction of mucosal immune responses, the MB groups were equivalent to CT and GARD and induced comparable systemic responses to those achieved by the parenteral vaccine plus alum. A dry powder formulation (GelVac) based on an inert in situ gelling polysaccharide (GelSite), obtained from Aloe vera, has been assessed in a pig nasal immunization model by Velasquez et al. (2011) . The authors compared immunogenicity of the dry powder VLP formulation vs. equivalent antigen/adjuvant liquid formulations. For this purpose test animals were immunized twice at 3-week intervals with one of the following: 10-12 mg/naris of GelVac alone, GelVac containing VLPs (10 \u03bcg), or GelVac VLPs (10 \u03bcg) + 10 \u03bcg of gardiquimod (GARD, a TLR7 agonist used as accessory adjuvant). In parallel, liquid formulations lacking GelVac and containing the same amount of NV VLPs were tested. Powder formulations, with or without VLPs, were similar in structure in dry form or when rehydrated in simulated nasal fluids. The GelVac powder induced higher antibody responses at systemic and mucosal (aerodigestive and reproductive tracts) levels when compared to liquid formulations. Inclusion of GARD did not increase immunogenicity of the dry formulation, while a positive effect was recorded for the liquid formulations. The authors hypothesized that the test formulation, upon in situ gelation, allows VLPs stabilization that ends up prolonging their presence on the mucosal surfaces overcoming mucociliary clearance and thus extending antigen uptake by APCs in the NALT. The same research group subsequently evaluated VLPs resembling GI or GII.4 norovirus to identify the optimal dose in guinea pigs. Pigs were i.n. immunized twice at 3-week intervals (Springer et al. 2016) . Test doses ranged 0.1-100 \u03bcg of VLPs. The humoral response magnitude followed a dose-dependent pattern in both serum and vaginal washes. The 15 \u03bcg dose allowed reaching maximum antibody responses. The neutralizing potential was assessed in an assay based on estimating the capacity of VLPs to bind porcine gastric mucin after incubation with sera from immunized animals. The neutralizing activity for both GI and GII.4 VLPs was proven, nevertheless no challenge assays were reported. These are interesting outcomes as no accessory adjuvants were used and suggest that bivalent vaccines targeting both GI/GII.4 noroviruses could be produced. Dry powder vaccines offer high stability such that cold-chain free vaccines could become a reality. Bahamondez-Canas and Cui (2018) have reviewed this specific topic recently.",

The vaccine was produced in insect cells and adjuvanted with monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL, which is a TLR-4 agonist) derived from the detoxified Salmonella minnesota lipopolysaccharide and the mucoadherent agent chitosan. Healthy subjects, 18-49 years old, were i.n. immunized twice at 3-week intervals. Study 1 evaluated 5, 15, and 50 \u03bcg of VLPs and study 2 evaluated 50 and 100 \u03bcg dosages. The vaccine induced no serious adverse events with nasal stuffiness, discharge, and sneezing as the most frequent side effects. Anti-VLPs IgG and IgA levels increased 4.8-and 9.1-fold, respectively, for the 100-\u03bcg dosage level (Fig. 10.11 ). All subjects that received either 50 or 100 \u03bcg doses presented IgA antibody secreting cells (ASCs) measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. ASCs expressed molecules associated with homing to mucosal and peripheral lymphoid tissues (CD19+CD27 +CD62L+, integrin \u03b14/\u03b27+). A subset expressing exclusively mucosal homing molecules was also detected (CD19+CD27+ CD62L-integrin \u03b14/\u03b27+). Therefore, this vaccine is considered safe and highly immunogenic that could progress into phase II clinical trials. ",

At present, there is a need for subunit vaccines able to confer mucosal protection without the use of attenuated strains given the risk of reversion to pathogenic forms (Bandyopadhyay et al. 2015) . Daniell et al. (2018) have developed a plant-made vaccine against PV by expressing, in lettuce, VLPs based on a chimeric protein comprising the VP1 protein from PV and the cholera toxin B subunit (CTB-VP1). The assembly of VP1-VLPs of 22.3 nm in size was evidenced. Mice were primed s.c. with IPV and boosted three times with 20 mg of lyophilized tissue and squalene and/or saponin plus Protegrin-1 (PG-1) and/or human antimicrobial peptide (LL37) as adjuvants and additives, respectively. Enhanced anti-PV IgG1 and IgA, as well as neutralizing activity (80-100% seropositivity of Sabin 1, 2, and 3), were induced upon boosting with the plant-made VLPs when compared to the treatment based on an IPV single dose or boosting with CTB-VP1 VLPs without IPV priming. These are considered very promising results since population worldwide is receiving IPV at a single dose, thus a booster cold-chain free vaccine might be used to aid in polio eradication.",

            "text": "The hepatitis B virus infection is a major public health problem worldwide. It is estimated that 30% of the population show serological evidence of current or past infection. Although vaccines are available and have led to an important decrease in infections, new vaccines are still required to fight this pathogen. The group headed by Pniewski et al. (2018) has been working on the development of a plant-made vaccine against hepatitis B, which is formulated with lettuce tissues expressing the hepatitis B virus small surface protein (S-HBsAg) assembled into VLPs within the plant cell. A recent study was focused on assessing several schemes to determine the potential of this low-cost vaccine to serve as boosting agent when combined with the i.m. administration of the conventional vaccine produced in yeast (Engerix_B). i.m. priming with the commercial vaccine followed by double oral boosting with plant-made VLPs is comparably efficient as standard i.m. vaccination, with boosting doses of 2 or 200 ng being efficacious to enhance systemic responses ( Fig. 10.12 ). None of the tested adjuvants improved the response to vaccination and the efficacy of plant lysate was lower than intact plant cells, which suggests that bioencapsulation of S-HBsAg into the plant cell favors vaccine activity not requiring accessory adjuvants (Fig. 10.13 ). This is a relevant study since plant-based platforms offer low production cost and the freeze-dried plant material is stable at room temperature, thus the formulation of this booster vaccine can be easily performed by preparing capsules or tablets containing plant powder. Hepatitis E is generally a self-limiting, acute, and rarely fatal disease that is treated with anti-virals; these are often insufficient and unsafe, thus the development of vaccines for HEV is an important goal (Nishiyama et al. 2019) . Niikura et al. (2002) reported the production in insect cells of chimeric VLPs comprised of the truncated hepatitis E virus ORF2 (aa 112-660), fused to a B-cell epitope of glycoprotein D from the herpes simplex virus. The chimeric VLPs showed morphology similar to that of the mature HEV virion and displayed the target epitope according to an immunoassay. Mice were orally immunized four times with 50 \u03bcg of VLPs at 2-week intervals. The chimeric VLPs induced specific intestinal IgG and IgA to both the inserted epitope and HEV-VLP in intestinal secretions. The authors proposed optimizing the dose of VLPs to enhance significant humoral responses. No immunoprotection assays were reported. Li et al. (2004) produced VLPs resembling the hepatitis E virus (HEV) by expressing, in insect cells, the HEV capsid protein gene lacking 111 amino acids at the N-terminal. The vaccine was administered orally to cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) in a scheme based on 10 mg VLPs doses administered on days 0, 7, 21, 36, and 80, with a subsequent i.v. HEV challenge. The test vaccine induced specific serum IgM, IgG, and IgA responses without adjuvants. Upon chal-lenge one monkey was fully protected and in another one infection occurred, but it did not develop the disease. Fecal IgA was not detected in any of the orally immunized monkeys.",

            "text": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a pathogen to which no licensed vaccines are available, being its genetic variability and mechanisms for immune evasion the factors hampered vaccine development (Rahman and Robert-Guroff 2019) . Poteet et al. (2016) have reported HIV VLPs composed of HIVIIIB Gag and HIVBaL gp120/gp41 envelope, which were produced in HEK cells. VLPs were coupled to VesiVax conjugatable adjuvant lipid vesicles (CALV) containing one the following Toll-like-receptor (TLR) ligands: PAM3CAG for TLR2, dsRNA for TLR3, MPLA for TLR4, and resiquimod for TLR7/8. Mice were immunized thrice at 2-week intervals with 200 \u03bcg VLPs dose. Priming was i.n. and boostings were performed by sub-cheek boosts. VLPs coupled with the TLR3 ligand, dsRNA, complexed to CALV and in combination with VLPs (CALV(dsRNA) + VLPs) induced the strongest humoral response against the target HIV antigens. Importantly, antibodies against clade c 96ZM651 gp120 were induced. A Th1 response was evidenced by IgG subclass analysis. The most potent neutralizing antibodies against HIV strain MN.3 were also generated by CALV(dsRNA) + VLPs, as well as a significant increase in germinal center B-cells and T follicular cells. This type of immunization schemes exemplifies how mucosal vaccination can be combined with boosts administered by injection in order to optimize the induced immune profile. Kang et al. (2003) generated VLPs from the Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) comprising Gag and Env proteins, expressed in insect cells. These VLPs were conjugated to the cholera toxin B subunit to determine if immunogenicity is enhanced by a subtransmucosal carrier. Mice were immunized i.n. on weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6 with 40 \u03bcg of VLPs, VLPs (40 \u03bcg) plus CTB (10 \u03bcg) or CT (10 \u03bcg), or VLPs (40 \u03bcg) conjugated with 10 \u03bcg of CTB. The major results were: co-administration of VLPs and CTB induced higher levels of anti-SIV gp160 IgG and IgA in mucosae (saliva, vaginal-wash, lung, and intestine) and higher neutralization activity when compared to VLPs alone. Conjugation of CTB to VLPs also enhanced SIV VLPspecific antibodies in sera and mucosae to similar levels. CTB-conjugated VLPs induced superior cellular responses (IFN-\u03b3-producing splenocytes and cytotoxic-Tlymphocyte activities) with respect to the VLPs/CTB mixture, along with enhanced IgG1 and IgG2a serum levels, indicating enhanced Th1-and Th2-type cellular immune responses. Alkadah et al. (2013) reported a rotavirus vaccine, produced in insect cells, based on VLPs composed of VP2 and VP6 from bovine rotavirus. The authors tested the effect of including LT-R192G, which is a mutant version of the heat labile enterotoxin from E. coli in immunization schemes based on either i.n. or i.r. routes. A single dose of the i.n. administered vaccine alone induced antigen-specific IL-10 and IL-17 secreting T-cells. IL-10-, in contrast to IL-17-, secreting T-cells did not migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), while they were detected in cervical lymph nodes (CLN) and spleen. The inclusion of LT-R192G improved immunogenicity in terms of activating the production of IL-2 and IL-4, increasing IL-17 secretion and inducing antigen-specific CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ and Foxp3\u2212T-cells in CLN, spleen, and MLN, while IL-10 secreting T-cells were unmodified. When i.r. administered, the vaccine plus LT-R192G induced IL-2 and IL-17 production; nonetheless, unlike the i.n. scheme, it did not trigger IL-4 production. No neutralization studies were performed to determine and compare the protective potential of these vaccination approaches. Binjawadagi et al. (2016) evaluated a vaccine against the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) using insect cell-made VLPs containing the GP5-GP4-GP3-GP2a-M or GP5-M proteins. A whole cell lysate from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tbWCL) was co-administered as adjuvant. VLPs were administered alone or entrapped in PLGA nanoparticles (average size of 300 nm). Immunoassays confirmed the presence of all proteins in the VLPs, suggesting the retention of antigenic determinants. Pigs i.n. immunized with VLPs (two doses of 650 \u03bcg at 2-week intervals) entrapped in PLGA nanoparticles induced an anamnestic immune response since elevation of IgG and IFN-\u03b3 production was observed after a challenge. The vaccinated group showed a two-log reduction in lung viral load. The authors suggested that efficacy should be improved, e.g., by including other viral structural proteins or producing VLPs carrying heterodimer (GP5-M) and heterotetramer (GP2a-E-GP3-GP4) interacting complexes, which are expected to resemble the native virion.",

The test vaccine was evaluated in orangespotted grouper, which were immunized twice at 2-week intervals by immersion (250 \u03bcg/g fish body weight, 1 mg of VLPs in 10 L-seawater, 30 min of immersion), intramuscular injection (dose: 2 \u03bcg/g FBW, 0.1 \u03bcg VLPs per fish), or orally (dose: 20 \u03bcg/g FBW, feeding for 4 days with food containing 200 \u03bcg/g VLPs, consumption of 5% of body weight). OSGNNV VLPs elicited strong humoral responses, with the immersion and i.m. routes inducing higher humoral responses than the oral scheme. Upon challenge, the relative percent of survival values for immersion, injection, and oral immunizations were: 81.9, 61.4, and 52.3, respectively. This type of vaccine is highly promising as no accessory adjuvants are required and immunization by immersion or feeding is practical for implementation in aquaculture. In addition, E. coli-expressed proteins are cheaper to produce when compared to insect and mammalian cell-based production. Crisci et al. (2012) reported a VLPs-based vaccine candidate against the footand-mouth disease virus (FMDV). The vaccine consisted of chimeric insect cellmade VLPs based on the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) carrying a T-cell epitope of the 3A protein from FMDV. The vaccine was evaluated in pigs immunized either i.n. or i.m. (doses: 20, 60, and 180 \u03bcg/pig; administered twice at 2-week intervals), having MontanideTM ISA 206 as adjuvant for i.m. immunization. Chimeric VLPs activated immature porcine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (poBMDCs) in vitro. IgG and IgA antibodies against RHDV-VLPs were induced. The adjuvanted i.m. immunized groups showed the highest humoral response. The adjuvanted group exhibited the highest IFN-\u03b3 secreting cell numbers and lymphoproliferative specific T-cell responses against the 3A epitope and RHDV-VLP. No neutralization or challenge experiments were conducted. Citarasu et al. (2019) produced a vaccine against the Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV), which is the causative agent of the white tail disease (WTD) in freshwater giant prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii). The vaccine comprised insect cell-made VLPs assembled with the MrNV capsid protein. The obtained VLPs were used to orally immunize larvae. For this purpose, animals were fed with VLPsupplemented feed during 60 days (10 \u03bcg of MrNV was added to 30 g of feed, leading to a daily intake of about 50-100 ng of VLPs during the test period). After either 30 or 60 days of vaccination period, prawns were orally challenged with virulent MrNV. Survival rates of 65 and 80% were achieved at 30 and 60 days postvaccination, respectively, whereas the non-vaccinated group had a 90% mortality. Pathogen load estimated by PCR decreased to 32 and 17% at 30 and 60 days postvaccination, respectively. The vaccine induced the expression of Mramp, which is believed to be involved in innate immune response against MrNV infection. No data on the induction of adaptive immune responses was presented.",

            "text": "VLPs stand as the most promising agents in the development of subunit vaccines, thanks to their high immunogenicity, stability, versatility, and safety. In terms of toxicity, it is clear that VLPs constitute one of the safest nanoparticulate systems as these are conformed by proteins, which contrast with metallic and polymeric nanoparticles that depending on the size, shape, and doses could lead to toxic effects. Overcoming the challenge of developing mucosal vaccines is with no doubt being driven by VLPs-based approaches, with substantial advances over the last years. Despite that the majority of the VLPs-based vaccines developed thus far have been evaluated in parenteral immunization schemes, the reports summarized in the present chapter indicate that there is a substantial potential to achieve the development of mucosal VLPs with a real possibility of becoming agents for the fight against relevant diseases in both humans and animals. The case of the influenza vaccines indicates that there is a remarkable niche for mucosal VLPs vaccines as some candidates are effective and in some cases they possess higher efficacy than the parenteral vaccination scheme. It is clear that the use of chimeric VLPs carrying accessory adjuvants to target TLRs is an effective approach to enhance vaccine efficacy.",

            "text": "The key perspectives identified for this topic comprise: (1) developing VLPsbased vaccines targeting specific receptors at the mucosal tissues to increase vaccine efficacy. As transport through M-cell is a critical step in the induction of immunity by mucosal routes, targeting these cells by specific ligands can increase the uptake of the antigen and increase the access for uptake by antigen presenting cells, which is the first step for the induction of robust adaptive immune responses. For this purpose, an M-cell-targeting peptide ligand Co1 has been described (Kim et al. 2010) . This concept has been proven with a vaccine against the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in which the COE antigen fused to Co1 exhibited higher immunogenicity in terms of inducing systemic and mucosal immune responses (Huy et al. 2012) . To the best of our knowledge, this approach has not been applied for VLPs-based vaccines. Another goal could expand the use of the nontoxic subunit of the cholera toxin (CTB) or the B subunit of the E. coli heat labile enterotoxin (LTB), both subunits bind to the GM1 ganglioside present in the membrane of the epithelial cells and allow the antigen to be transported into the submucosa. (2) Although several promising VLPs-based vaccine candidates are found in the literature, most of the vaccines are produced in insect or mammalian cells, which are expensive production platforms. Expanding the use of low-cost platforms such as plants is a relevant perspective. This technology has led to influenza vaccine candidates that are currently under clinical trials, but administered by a parenteral route (Pillet et al. 2018) . (3) Another attractive approach is the one recently reported by Serradell et al. (2019) , which is expected to lead to oral vaccine candidates against several infectious diseases. In addition, the fact that this vaccination approach resulted effective in a cancer model makes this vaccine highly attractive for the field of cancer immunotherapies given that most of the promising vaccines against cancer are administered by parenteral routes. Therefore, innovative oral cancer vaccines using this approach are envisaged. (4) A detailed exploration of the innovative immunization routes is a point that deserves consideration for VLPs-based vaccines. Sublingual immunization has been recently highlighted as very attractive as this allows inducing robust immune responses (Bahceciler et al. 2014) . Therefore, expanding the evaluation of VPLs-based vaccines by the s.l. route will open new possibilities to address vaccinology challenges. For instance, the group headed by Kweon is working on the evaluation of a s.l. vaccine against the Group A Streptococcus based on VLPs assembled with the VP1 structural protein from the murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) produced in E. coli (Seth et al. 2016) .",

            "text": "VLPs are advantageous agents for vaccine development that will lead, with no doubt, to more advances in the clinic for the fight against infectious and noncommunicable diseases. It is of interest that VLPs-based vaccine candidates against emerging pathogens such as the Zika virus (Yang et al. 2017) , Nipah virus (Walpita et al. 2018) , Chikungunya virus (Salazar-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2015) , and Ebola virus (Rosales-Mendoza et al. 2017 ) are under development. However, the vaccine candidates have been mainly evaluated in parenteral immunization schemes; their evaluation in schemes based on mucosal immunization remains a relevant pending goal knowing that mucosal vaccination could lead to higher efficacy than the schemes based on parenteral administration. The use of prime-boosting schemes should be also studied in a more systematic way to achieve better immune profiles, i.e., optimal immune responses at both the systemic and mucosal levels. Another innovation expected in the following years is related to applying computer-based modeling methods to ensure proper antigen spatial conformation, especially in chimeric VLPs where conformational epitopes are critical for vaccine efficacy (Liljeroos et al. 2015) . The generation of more sophisticated VLPs containing antigens arranged in multimeric arrays on carrier surfaces, as well as different immunostimulating components, is envisaged.",

Virus-like particles can be genetically modified to incorporate peptide and protein antigens (in red) by genetic fusion to the C/N-termini or in the flexible loop regions of the VLP-forming protein (blue). Accessory adjuvant protein sequences, such as LTB and Flic, can be also attached (yellow) to enhance the immunogenicity of the particle. These strategies allow obtaining VLPs with an exact placement of the target antigen within the final particle, having a defined number of target antigen molecules per particle",
