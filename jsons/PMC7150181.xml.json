A brisk extension of the limb (stifle) is expected when the patellar ligaments are struck with the side of the hand. This reflex involves the L4\u2013L5 spinal segments and is mediated through the femoral nerve.4.The pelvic limb flexor or withdrawal reflex involves the L5\u2013S3 spinal segments and is mediated through the sciatic nerve. Pinching the skin of the distal limb, the coronary band or the bulbs of the heel should elicit a withdrawal of the limb and/or a central recognition of pain.5.The gastrocnemius reflex is performed by bluntly striking the gastrocnemius tendon and observing for extension of the hock. This reflex involves spinal cord segments L5\u2013S3 and is mediated through the tibial branch of the sciatic nerve.6.The cranial tibial reflex is performed by holding the limb in relaxed extension and balloting the cranial tibial muscle. The expected response is flexion of the hock.7.Reflex testing in the thoracic limbs includes evaluation of the flexor and triceps reflexes. The triceps reflex is tested by holding the limb in relaxed flexion and tapping the triceps tendon above its insertion at the olecranon. This reflex is mediated by the radial nerve through the cervical intumescence (C6\u2013T1).8.The flexor or withdrawal reflex of the thoracic limb is mediated through the last three cervical and first two thoracic spinal cord segments. The expected response is a flexion of the digit, carpus, elbow and shoulder. A response to pain should be observed.9.Thoracolumbar lesions can be localized by evaluating the cutaneous reflex along the lateral body wall:\u2022Gentle pinching or poking of the skin along the lateral thorax elicits a twitching of the cutaneous trunci muscle.\u2022The sensory input is carried to the spinal cord at the level of stimulation. It then travels cranially in the spinal cord white matter to the last thoracic and first cervical segments and synapses with the lower motor neurons of the lateral thoracic nerve.\u2022The lateral thoracic nerve innervates the cutaneous trunci muscle. Damage to any portion of this pathway results in an absence of the cutaneous trunci reflex.\n10.The perineal reflex evaluates the last sacral segments and the caudal spinal cord segments.

It has been proposed that impaired oxygen delivery before, during or after birth, with subsequent hypoxic\u2013ischaemic injury to the CNS, is the primary cause of the syndrome.\u2022Intracranial haemorrhage as a result of excessive pressures during foaling may be a causative factor.\u2022Impaired oxygen delivery may result from placental problems before birth (placental separation, placentitis, maternal diseases), problems during birth (dystocia, umbilical cord compression, etc.) or postpartum events (isoerythrolysis).\u2022Most of the brain damage occurs subsequent to the hypoxia during the period of reperfusion (12\u201324 hours after the initial insult). Oxygen deprivation leads to abnormal membrane ion gradients, with excessive sodium and calcium influx (cytotoxic). In addition, the production of free radicals (reperfusion injury), activation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors by excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate) with subsequent calcium influx, and decreased NMDA receptor blockade by magnesium have been proposed. These events lead to neuronal death.\u2022Foals with NMS are prone to sepsis for several reasons. Often they do not nurse because of neurological dysfunction, missing the timing for immunoglobulin absorption. If the NMS is the result of premature placental separation it is also likely that there was premature lactation and therefore no colostrum. If the cause was the result of hypoxia during or immediately after birth it is also possible that there was hypoxia to the intestinal tract, leading to epithelial denudation and bacterial entrance. A combination of these processes is common.\n",

In foals, the condition primarily occurs in Suffolk horses (Suffolk Punch) and Shetland ponies, indicating that it is inherited. Occasionally it may present in other breeds. It is believed that complete inhibition of skeletal muscle tone during acute sleep episodes is associated with abnormal function of the sleep\u2013awake centre. In horses, episodes of cataplexy can be triggered by grooming, initiation of various activities, changes in environment, etc. Information on the pathogenesis in foals or horses is limited.\u2022In general, clinical signs present in foals several months old. The foal may show weakness, or collapse. Sleep cycles can last from seconds to 10\u201315 minutes, and foals are normal between episodes.\u2022The diagnosis is clinical as most laboratory and imaging tests are non-diagnostic. Electroencephalography may assist in confirming the diagnosis, although this is a low-yield test. The physostigmine provocation test (0.05\u20130.1 mg/kg IV over 10 minutes) may precipitate episodes of cataplexy 3\u201310 minutes after administration in adult horses, but the effect in foals is unknown.

Atropine sulphate (0.04\u20130.08 mg/kg IV) may provide temporary control for up to 24 hours.

At birth the cerebellum appears to be normal in size, with normal neurons; however, as the foal ages there is degeneration and depletion of the Purkinje cells. The exact mechanism for the development of cerebellar abiotrophy is unknown, but decreased trophic stimulation and free radical injury have been proposed. In foals with severe disease the cerebellum is small.\u2022Clinical signs include head tremors that worsen with external stimulation or blindfolding (intentional tremors), progressive ataxia, wide-based stance and gait, dysmetria with a hypermetric goose-stepping gait, hypometria, spasticity, inability to perform precise movements (apprehension, nursing), delayed or absent menace response, falling over, and inability to stand in severe cases. There are no changes in mentation, and nystagmus is rarely observed. These foals eventually have to be euthanized.\u2022The diagnosis is clinical and post-mortem.

Can cause enterocolitis with severe diarrhoea, colic, depression and fever.

It causes a profuse watery diarrhoea in foals usually <1 month of age; most foals are younger than 2 weeks of age. Many foals on the farm are affected within 3\u20135 days. Diarrhoea is usually profuse and watery. The virus induces denudation of the epithelial cells of the proximal intestine, resulting in increased secretion and decreased absorption of fluids and electrolytes. These cells also produce disaccharidases such as lactase; thus, lactose is not digested in the small intestine but is broken down by bacteria in the large intestine. This worsens the diarrhoea as glucose pulls water into the intestine (osmotic diarrhoea).\u25aaBlood abnormalities include metabolic acidosis, hyponatraemia, hypochloraemia, and hypokalaemia.\u25aaAs gastroduodenal ulcers may develop, anti-acid drugs should be considered, especially when entral feeding is decreased.\u25aaAs foals with rotavirus infection can dehydrate quickly, rapid intervention is required. Therapy should include balanced electrolyte solutions and sodium bicarbonate. Enteral feeding should be restricted or reduced.\u25aaOther viruses that have been isolated from foals with diarrhoea include coronavirus, parvovirus and adenovirus. Their pathogenicity in foals is unknown. These viruses are typically isolated from immunocompromised foals and do not cause outbreaks.\n\u2022Parasitic causes of diarrhoea (see Chapter 19).\u25aa\nStrongyloides westeri is a nematode that may cause mild diarrhoea in the foal at 1\u20134 weeks of age.\u25aaHeavy infestation with strongyles or Parascaris equorum may cause diarrhoea but uncommonly.\u25aa\nCryptosporidium may occur in immunocompromised foals. This has zoonotic potential. Treatment is by supportive care.\n\n2.Foal heat diarrhoea.\u2022Self-limiting diarrhoea that occurs between 6 and 14 days of age.\u2022Affected foals are not systemically ill, and usually no treatment is necessary.\u2022Resolves in <1 week.\n3.Nutritional causes of diarrhoea.\u2022Over-eating or over-feeding, sudden changes in diet, or ingestion of sand or dirt can cause diarrhoea.\u2022Lactose intolerance is uncommon as a primary condition. Usually this is a transient condition secondary to infectious diarrhoea.\n4.Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.\u2022The administration of antimicrobial drugs can alter the normal microflora of the gastrointestinal tract which can lead to colonization by pathogenic bacteria. This is rarely a problem in newborn foals, but can occur in foals at a few weeks of age.\u2022Antibiotics associated with diarrhoea include macrolides (erythromycin, azythromycin), oxytetracycline, trimethoprim\u2013sulphonamides, penicillins, and third-generation cefalosporins.\u2022There is a low incidence of antibiotic-related diarrhoea in foals; therefore these antibiotics should still be used if needed. If diarrhoea develops, consider discontinuing the antibiotic.\n\n",

            "text": "Initial treatment is supportive with the goal of correcting hydration, acid\u2013base and electrolyte imbalances, and hypoglycaemia.1.Intravenous fluids. There are many options on the market, but balanced isotonic replacement solutions such as lactated Ringer's solution, Plasma-Lyte 148, Normosol R, or Isolyte S are good initial options. Saline solution (0.9%) can be used in some cases. Another aspect to consider when using these solution is the pH; while replacement solutions have a pH of >6.0, pH of 0.9% saline solution is 4.0. This may be relevant in foals with metabolic acidosis.\u2022Administration of KCl should be considered in severe hypokalaemia. KCl administration should not exceed 0.25\u20130.5 mEq/kg/h as a rapid rate may lead to cardiac dysrhythmias. Mild hypokalaemia is often corrected with restoration of the hydration status, and intravenous or oral supplementation of KCl may not be necessary.\u2022Supplementation becomes more important in foals with metabolic acidosis, as low pH leads to overestimation of serum K concentrations. As the pH increases K moves into the cells and vice versa.\u2022Severe acidosis may require intravenous administration of isotonic sodium bicarbonate. It is preferable to administer sodium bicarbonate alone than to mix it with other solutions, in particular those with calcium and magnesium salts as they may precipitate. Rapid administration of sodium-containing fluids to foals with severe hyponatraemia may lead to neurological signs.\u2022Dextrose may be added to fluids for hypoglycaemic foals. Typical solutions include 5% dextrose or 2.5% dextrose + 0.45% saline. Dextrose can also be added to other solutions to create a 2.5\u20135% concentration. Injectable hypertonic dextrose comes as a 25% or 50% solution.\u2022Hypocalcaemia is a frequent abnormality in foals with gastrointestinal disease. Isotonic solutions can be supplemented with calcium gluconate (23%) at 10 mL/L.\n2.Oral electrolyte solutions.\u2022Not as effective in correcting severe electrolyte and acid\u2013base imbalances, especially if absorption is impaired from enteritis. However, oral supplementation of potassium chloride and sodium bicarbonate is an effective and cheaper way to correct electrolyte concentrations in foals with mild abnormalities.\u2022Older foals may be able to maintain hydration and correct mild electrolyte imbalances if free-choice water and electrolytes (in water or salt block with trace minerals) are provided.\u2022If the foal is not interested in drinking, fluids and electrolytes may be administered via nasogastric tube.\n3.Nutrition/caloric intake is very important in foals. Supplementation should be considered if the foal is not nursing or eating, of if the foal has evidence of proximal intestinal disease or lactose intolerance (idiopathic, rotavirus).\u2022If the foal is interested in eating, controlled nursing is important as excessive milk intake may worsen the clinical signs. Excess of lactose in a dysfunctional small intestine may lead to bacterial breakdown of lactose to glucose and galactose. Glucose is osmotically active, drawing more water into the intestine. In addition, this increase in luminal glucose can lead to bacterial overgrowth.\u2022If the foal is not interested in nursing, a small-bore feeding tube can be placed. These tubes have the advantage that the foal can nurse without problems, and they can be left in place for many days.\u2022Bottle feeding should be done by experienced personnel as in some situations it may lead to aspiration pneumonia.\u2022If there is no evidence of improvement and the foal does not tolerate enteral feeding, parenteral nutrition should be considered.\n4.Antibiotics.\u2022There are several factors to take into consideration in the selection of antimicrobial drugs, including current disease, aetiological agent, drug interactions, toxicity, and cost. The initial choice should be a broad-spectrum combination, unless the aetiological agent and sensitivity are known.\u2022A combination of penicillin (or ampicillin) and an aminoglycoside (gentamicin or amikacin) is the most frequently used combination. It is important that the foal is well hydrated and that there is no evidence of renal disease, as aminoglycosides are nephrotoxic, particularly if there is dehydration and concurrent use of other nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. flunixin meglumine).\u2022Third-generation cefalosporins such as ceftiofur (4.4\u20138.8 mg/kg IV BID), cefotaxime (40 mg/kg IV TID\u2013QID), ceftazidime (40 mg/kg IV TID\u2013QID), or ceftriaxone (10 mg/kg IV BID).\u2022Metronidazole (20 mg/kg PO TID\u2013QID) should be considered in foals with haemorrhagic diarrhoea, as this is a common finding in clostridial diarrhoea.\n5.Anti-endotoxin therapy.\u2022Flunixin meglumine (0.25 mg/kg IV TID) or polymyxin B (3000\u20136000 IU/kg IV BID, in 5% dextrose solution) should be considered in foals with severe sepsis or evidence of endotoxaemia.\n6.Intestinal protectants. The use of these products is controversial, but protectants to consider are bismuth subsalicylate, kaolin, pectin, and activated charcoal. More recently, smectite-based products (Bio-Sponge) have been claimed to show good results in treating foal diarrhoea.7.Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.\u2022Flunixin meglumine if there is evidence of endotoxaemia (0.25 mg/kg IV TID) or fever, pain, inflammation (0.25\u20131.1 mg/kg IV).\u2022Ketoprofen (1.1\u20132.2 mg/kg IV) is a good choice in foals with fever and pain. It is less ulcerogenic than other non-steroidal drugs.\n8.Plasma transfusion may be indicated in cases of FTPI or in foals with hypoproteinaemia.9.Additional therapeutic measures.Oral supplementation with lactase should be considered in foals with watery diarrhoea, foals with rotavirus infection, or in foals that do not tolerate enteral feeding. Anti-acid drugs such as cimetidine, ranitidine, or omeprazole can be used as foals are prone to developing gastric ulcers.\n",
