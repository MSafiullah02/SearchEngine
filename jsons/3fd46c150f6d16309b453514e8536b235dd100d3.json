SARS-CoV infection occurs transiently in the mouse and the virus is cleared by day 7 postinfection (7), although an age-related susceptibility to lung disease in old mice has been shown (9) . In the course of studying the cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV, we found that some proteases, such as trypsin and elastase, produced in the host animals enhance SARS-CoV infection in cultured cells (10) . In a previous study, we examined whether weak inflammation in the lungs induced by low-pathogenicity bacterial infection, which could induce elastase, enhances SARS-CoV infection and we showed that low-virulence c 2008 The Societies and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd Pp infection, as well as administration of lipopolysaccharide derived from Escherichia coli, induced elastase in the lungs and enhanced the replication of SARS-CoV, which resulted in the exacerbated respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV infection with a high mortality rate.

When these recombinant DIs vaccines were given to mice either s.c. or intranasally, the humoral and cellular immunities against SARS-CoV were elicited. We showed that a high level of serum neutralizing IgG antibody elicited by subcutaneous injection of these vaccinias strongly suppressed SARS-CoV replication in the lungs and that the neutralizing IgA-type antibody elicited only by mucosal (intranasal) immunization was not absolutely required. Furthermore, we demonstrated that DIs expressing the S protein alone or in combination with other components, but not N alone, elicited strong neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses against SARS-CoV infection. Although we and others demonstrated that the vaccine expressing the S protein alone was able to inhibit SARS-CoV replication efficiently in mice, the role of the N-specific T-cell response for protection had not been formally excluded, because the SARS-CoV infection in mice is usually cleared rapidly without causing any pulmonary disease.",

By giving SKOT-20 monoclonal neutralizing antibody recognizing the S protein just before Pp infection, the mortality of mice coinfected with Pp and SARS-CoV was dramatically reduced in a dose-dependent manner. These results clearly show that the neutralizing antibody against S protein is highly effective and sufficient to prevent SARS development.

Similar to the results of whole virion vaccines as described above, mice vaccinated with DIs showed transient and minimal clinical symptoms, such as ruffled hair and weight loss until 3 days after Fr-mo infection (Fig. 2, left) . Severe symptoms continued during the observation period in control mice. On days 4-7 after virus infection, these mice suffered the loss of 40% or more of their bodyweight, and more than 80% of those mice died after exhibiting severe respiratory disease, whereas none of the mice vaccinated with recombinant DIs expressing S proteins died (Fig. 2,  right) . To further evaluate the vaccine effect, we measured serum neutralizing antibody and SARS-CoV titer in the lung lavage of vaccinated mice. Before Pp and SARS-CoV coinfection, vaccinated mice developed a high level of anti-SARS-CoV IgG with neutralizing activity (data not shown). As shown in Figure 3a , a high level of neutralizing antibody was maintained during coinfection experiments, at day 3 until day 7 postinfection in all vaccinated mouse groups. The SARS-CoV titer in the lung lavage was high at day 3 postinfection, decreased at day 5 (Fig. 3b , blank column: alum only and DIs-cont) and virus became undetectable at day 7 (data not shown). In contrast, the virus titers were significantly reduced in parallel with a high titer of plasma neutralizing antibody in all vaccinated groups (Fig. 3a) . Therefore, both whole virion vaccines and vaccinia vector expressing spike protein were protective from a highly pathogenic pulmonary infection of SARS-CoV in the presence of opportunistic infection by Pp in this case. Furthermore, the results by DIs-S vaccine suggest that the neutralizing antibody against SARS-CoV spike protein alone is highly effective for the prevention of SARS development.",

(11) demonstrated previously that the levels of IP-10 and IFN-\u03b3 are significantly high in SARS-CoVinfected and Pp/SARS-CoV-coinfected mouse lung homogenates at 2 days after SARS-CoV infection. However, these cytokines became undetectable at day 4 postinfection. To better understand the involvement of cytokines in the lung pathogenesis of SARS, we simultaneously measured six cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12p70) in the lung lavage of vaccinated or unvaccinated mice at day 3 after SARS-CoV infection, when viruses replicate most extensively and vaccinated mice experienced maximum weight loss. As shown in Figure 4 , the increased production of MCP-1 and IL-6 in the lungs of the control mouse group (alum and DIs-cont) was strongly suppressed in vaccinated mice, which were able to control virus replication. Increased production of other cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, was not observed. Therefore, it is possible that IL-6 and MCP-1 play a role in the establishment of lung pathology in the Pp and SARS-CoV coinfection model.",

Therefore, we measured 20 cytokines in lung lavages of these protected and unprotected mice by using a mouse cytokine 20-plex antibody bead kit at day 0 (after Pp infection before SARS-CoV infection), day 1, day 2 and day 3 after SARS-CoV infection as previously reported (16) . The production of two cytokines, IL-6 and MCP-1, were increased at days 2 and 3 after SARS-CoV infection in association with high titers of SARS-CoV, as shown in Figure 4 . Interestingly, the production of IL-6 was increased by Pp infection alone, decreasing on day 1 and increasing again, whereas that of MCP-1 increased only after SARS-CoV infection. These cytokines were not increased in protected mice (Fig. 6a) , suggesting the importance of these two cytokines in the lung pathogenesis. Other cytokine profiles are shown in Figure 6b and c. The level of IP-10 was quite high after SARS-CoV infection on day 1. However, even protected mice produced a high level of IP-10. In contrast, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, and KC were produced only before SARS-CoV infection and the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and VEGF were consistently low.
