Our risk index is evaluated as a function of three different components: the hazard of the disease, the exposure of the area and the vulnerability of its inhabitants. As an application, we discuss the case of COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. We characterize each of the twenty Italian regions by using available historical data on air pollution, human mobility, winter temperature, housing concentration, health care density, population size and age. We find that the epidemic risk is higher in some of the Northern regions with respect to Central and Southern Italy. The corresponding risk index shows correlations with the available official data on the number of infected individuals, patients in intensive care and deceased patients, and can help explaining why regions such as Lombardia, Emilia-Romagna, Piemonte and Veneto have suffered much more than the rest of the country. Although the COVID-19 outbreak started in both North (Lombardia and Veneto) and Central Italy (Lazio) almost at the same time, when the first cases were officially certified at the beginning of 2020, the disease has spread faster and with heavier consequences in regions with higher epidemic risk.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus initially announced as the causative agent of pneumonia of unknown etiology in Wuhan city, China. The genome sequence is related to a viral species named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related-CoV. These viral species also comprise some viruses detected in rhinolophid bat in Europe and Asia (Zhang 2019 , Peiris 2003 . A specific protein (S protein) of virus surface facilitates viral entry in the target cells by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Hoffman et al. 2020) ; the membrane glycoprotein Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is also considered a potential key factor in the determinism of coronavirus infections (Doremalen 2014) . Several cytokines generated during the virus infection causes a hyper-activation of Janus Protein Kinase (JAK) / Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STAT) protein family, that is involved in many specialized cell processes as the development, proliferation and homeostasis (Stebbing 2020) . The mechanisms of immunological response to the virus infection are incompletely known, however a dysregulation of the immune system is very likely responsible for a worse outcome especially in patients with pre-existing respiratory or systemic diseases (Conticini, 2020) . Most infections by coronavirus are mild and selftreated, so that it can be misleading, especially in the early stages of the disease evolution, to estimate the real spread of the virus just on reports of hospital and general practitioner reports. Moreover, these reports vary according to how the numbers of cases are measured, the number of tests being related only to the number of symptomatic patients. However, the large amount of official data made public in recent weeks, and updated day by day (GitHub 2020), has stimulated the development of mathematical models, which are fundamental to understand the possible evolution of an epidemic and to plan effective control strategies (see for example Giordano et al. 2020 , Castro et al 2020 , Castorina et al. 2020 , Lanteri et al. 2020 , Fanelli et al. 2020 , Zlatic et al 2020 , Magdon-Ismail 2020 . Due to the incompleteness of the data and to the intrinsic complexity of the globalized world where we live, predicting the evolution of the pandemic, the epidemic peak and the end of it, is a difficult challenge (Castro et al 2020) . In this regard, it is worth quoting a famous sentence attributed to Niels Bohr, \"Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future\". In this paper we propose a different approach that aims instead at evaluating the apriori risk of an epidemic, and can then also help strategic planning to prevent or decrease the impact of future epidemics.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak started officially in China in January 2020, although the virus was probably already circulating in the country since late October 2019 according to a recent report (Giovanetti et al. 2020 ). In Italy the first infected Italian patient was officially detected on the night of February 20 in Codogno (Lombardia), even if a recent research study of Lombardia Region reveals that more than 1000 positive cases were present (but not tested) in that region already in the second half of January (Reuters 2020 ). On the other hand, at the end of January, a couple of Chinese tourists coming from Wuhan were hospitalized in Rome (Lazio) after the confirmation test of the infection. So in Italy we have had at least two official starting points of the COVID-19 outbreak, one in the north of Italy and one in the central part (Giovanetti et al. 2020 ) leaving an open question on the reasons for the faster diffusion of the virus in the northern regions of Italy than in the central ones. The approach proposed in this paper can offer a possible explanation for the observed different diffusion and impact of the disease, based on a series of cofactors that can differentiate the regions of Italy in various respects. In particular, the methodology we introduce, based on the Crichton's triangle (Crichton 1999 , Kron 2002 , evaluates the epidemic risk index of the various Italian regions in terms of several factors, such such as air pollution, people mobility, winter temperature, housing concentration, health care density, population size and age, which can be quantified using available data. These factors have been combined to construct a reliable indicator of the a-priori epidemic risk index in Italy, which has then been compared to the impact of the current COVID-19 outbreak. As we will show below, Italian regions which have been mostly affected by the pandemic (in terms of patients in intensive care units (ICU) and deceased ones) are also those with the highest value of risk for a virus epidemic to start, diffuse and be harmful for the population. Furthermore, we will show that our epidemic risk index compares well also with the official available data of seasonal flu 2019-2020 in Italy (Epicentro 2020). Finally, we will propose a theoretical policy model to properly address containment and risk reduction strategies which could be useful not only for the present case, which hopefully will end within a few months, but also in the future to decrease the impact of new epidemic waves.",

Up to April 2 the official report records in Italy we had 115252 total infected cases and 13915 deceased persons due to COVID-19. However, several recent studies have shown that the official data underestimate the correct numbers of infected people. In ref. (Pinotti et al. 2020 ) it has been shown that at least 60% of infected individuals are asymptomatic, and usually difficult to detect. In fact the testing strategies adopted in Italy have generally consisted in testing only those people who show severe symptoms and especially people over 65. For this reason the daily data officially reported depend very much on the number of tests done on the population and result in a biased sample towards aged patients.",

The average value is the highest in the world with a value around 10%. In China, where the outbreak started, the average value is 4%. Such a disproportion could be also due, in part, to the fact that in China the average age of the population is 38 years old against a value for Italy equal to 47 (Italy is the country with the most aged population after Japan (Worldometer 2020)). However, the main reason is probably that the real number of infected people is much greater than what official data tell us.",

If tests are performed only to severe, hospitalized and aged patients, as it has happened in most of the Italian regions with the exception of Veneto, the lethality obviously increases. A plausible realistic estimate of the Italian average lethality rate, done through the comparison with other countries gives an estimate around 1.14% (Villa 2020) . On the basis of these data, it is possible to make a more realistic estimate of the actual number of infected people in Italy, which could be around ten times the one reported by the official data (Villa 2020) . A recent study of the Imperial College (Flaxman et al. 2020) goes even further along this line, estimating that around 10% of the Italian population (i.e. around 6 million people) has been infected by COVID-19 on March 28, against the official number of around 92500 persons at the same date.",

But there is another important information that we can extract from these data. Fig. 1 Summarizing, we can conclude that, in general, the official Italian data on the number of detected positive cases, and on those of hospitalized, intensive care and deceased patients underestimate the real impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. What emerges with no doubt from the data, and in particular from those in Fig. 1(b) , is that the more dramatic impact of the outbreak in the northern regions of Italy than in the rest of the country. At a first sight this may appear strange, considering the two official outbreaks of COVID-19 in the central part (at the end of January) and in the northern part (at the end of February) of Italy (Giovanetti et al. 2020) , and in addition to this the several waves of hundreds of thousands people leaving the northern areas to come back to their home regions in central and southern areas before the lockdown of the country on March 9 (Pepe 2020, The Guardian 2020). This is confirmed by a recent survey on human mobility based on cellular phone data as shown in panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 1 where the outgoing people flow from Lombardia to other regions of central and southern Italy on two different dates, namely February 23, 2020 and March 7, 2020 is reported (Teralytics 2020). It is then plausible that the virus had enough time to spread in the whole country already before any mobility restriction. As we will show below, if we limit ourselves to a coarse grain description, we shall be able to identify groups of regions, with an a-priori level of epidemic risk that is in agreement with the heterogeneous geographical impact of the outbreak.",

In particular, we consider the E_HV model, where the effect of Hazard and Vulnerability are combined in a single affine function of the six indicators, and the E_H_V model, where Hazard and Vulnerability are considered as affine functions of, respectively, mobility index, housing concentration and healthcare density, on one hand, and air pollution, average winter temperature and age of population on the other hand (see Fig. 2 (m) for a summary). In both models the Exposure is represented by the population of each region. Furthermore, two versions of each model have been considered: an optimized one, where the weights of the risk indicators are obtained through a least-square fitting versus real COVID-19 data, and an a-priori one, where all the weights are assumed to be equal. Tables M3 and M4 in Methods, the models based on fitting the parameters give a better agreement, both in terms of relative mean quadratic error and correlation coefficient, with the data, as expected. In particular, E_H_V model gives the best agreement. Furthermore, in agreement with the strong correlation of the variables with the targets, most coefficients are positive. Indeed, all coefficients obtained by fitting the number of cases and the intensive care occupancy are positive, and only one negative coefficient appears in each model, when fitting the number of deceased. However, the numerical value of the coefficients strongly depend on both models and targets, making these models not very robust. On the other hand, the a-priori models are independent of the targets, depending only on the choice of the variables we decided to include in the risk evaluation.",

The values of ! have been normalized to their maximum value, so that Lombardia results to have ! =1. The average of ! over all the regions results to be \"# = 0.15 and can be considered approximately a reference level for the Italian country (even if, of course, it has only a relative value). As already explained, due to the intrinsic limitations of the official COVID-19 data, it is convenient to make the comparison at the aggregate level of groups of regions. Let us therefore arrange the 20 regions, listed in order of decreasing risk, in 4 color groups, depending on their level of damage in terms of total cases registered (less than 1000, between 1000 and 8000, between 8000 and 16000, more than 16000). With this choice, our model is clearly able to correctly identify the four northern regions where the epidemic effects are today far more evident: the first in the ranking, i.e. Lombardia (with a risk score about three times more than the second classified) and the group of the three regions immediately after it, Veneto, Piemonte and Emilia Romagna (even if not in the exact order of damage). A quite good agreement can be observed also for the other two groups: only for Sardegna the effects on both total cases and deaths seem to have been slightly overestimated (its insularity might play a role), while for other two regions, Umbria and Valle d'Aosta, one of the two damage indicators has been slightly underestimated.",

The value of the risk index is reported in parentheses next to each region name. It is interesting to notice that, as shown in detail in Fig. 5b where the ranking of the Italian regions has been disaggregated for both Hazard and Consequences, some regions (such as Friuli, Trentino or Valle d'Aosta) are characterized by high values of Hazard but quite low values of Consequences, while for other regions (such as Campania or Piemonte the opposite is true (see also the colored geographic maps (c) and (d) for a visual comparison).

The normative approach here described presents a viable framework to assess possible policy protocols. Several variables affecting the diffusion of an infection can be looked at as suitable policy instruments to manage both the spreading process and the stress level to the healthcare system of a given district (such as a country, a region, an urban area, etc.). Following the evidence suggested by data, we propose a theoretical model (whose details are presented in the section about Methods, subsection 4) based on two independent variables influencing the level of risk, namely the infection ratio, i.e., the proportion of infected individuals over the total population, and the number of per capita hospital beds, as a measure of the impact of consequences caused by the spreading of the disease. We adopt an approach based on a standard model of economic policy, in which a series of instruments explicitly affecting the infection ratio and the per capita hospital beds endowment can be used to approach the target, i.e., the minimization of the risk level. A similar rationale, covering other topics, can be found in Samuelson and Solow (1960) and builds upon a widely consolidated literature which dates back in time (Pigou, 1932 , Hotelling 1938 , Hicks 1939 , Samuelson 1947 and 1956 , Bator 1957 , among many others). Despite the analysis concerns a collective problem, the model here proposed describes elements of a possible decision process followed by an individual policy-maker, thus remaining microeconomic in nature. Panel (a) in Fig. 7 shows the risk function, while the right panel provides an illustration of the family of its convex contours, for a finite set of risk levels (limited for graphic convenience): Fig. 7 replicates the meaning of Fig. 5a by translating the consequences indicated by data as the required per capita hospital beds, while explaining that the position of each iso-risk curve corresponds to the different actual composition of the scenario at hand.",

Further policy actions are possible to approach a lower iso-risk curve or to save resources and/or re-allocate them differently. A policy can be considered satisfactory when any of points belonging to the arc TT' is reached, e.g. the point L. Alternative policies are neither equivalent, nor requiring the same actions, and the policy-maker has to choose actions with reference to the actual data collected by its own Country. Points F and G, although carrying the same risk level as E, still represent out-of-control positions. Different regions of the plot have a different signaling power: at point F, the infection rate is low and, thus, very difficult to be further reduced. In such a case, for example, it would be advisable to suggest health protocols which improve people safety. On the contrary, at point G, the infection rate is so high that strong direction to create a limit on social interaction easily appears to be much more urgent than rules of conduct or medical protocols. The right mix between a demand-side and a supply-side policy to adopt is a decision of political nature. A distinction can be made by saying that demand-side policies are devoted to reduce the number of newly infected people (by means of restrictions to movements, quarantine regulations, rules of conduct, etc.) and their effects are able to lower the iso-risk curves; supply-side policies are, instead, aimed at incrementing the carrying capacity of the system (by means of expenditure for the healthcare system, increments of dedicated personnel and intensive care beds, in-house medical protocols) and their effects can shift the constraint representing the carrying capacity of the system. Politics has, then, to decide when the risk is low enough or the constraint is sufficiently high. Specific calibration of the model will allow, in a forthcoming research, a detailed analysis of policy implications, by considering actual conditions and risk factors of specific districts, thus providing the policy-maker with a toolbox for normative directions. For instance, the model can be read to analyze differences in proposed actions in Lombardia and Veneto, and in other regions or countries.",

            "text": "We have shown how a data-driven epidemic risk analysis, that accounts for a proper combination of a set of cofactors, can contribute to understanding the highly inhomogeneous spread of COVID-19 in Italy in terms of a different a-priori risk exposure of different geographical areas. Regions such as Lombardia, Veneto, Piemonte and Emilia Romagna result indeed in the first positions of our proposed a-priori risk rankings, which consists of three main components, Hazard, Exposure and Vulnerability, related, directly or indirectly, to the probability of spreading of a virus and of its harming ability. We have evaluated these three components by using historical available data on various factors that can contribute. In the second part of the paper we then advanced a theoretical policy model that provides an intuitive instrumental toolbox on complex problems, as those deriving from an epidemic emergency. While preserving simplicity, the model is able to depict various scenarios according to actual data and can help designing policy strategies fitting the situation at hand. In particular, by means of a reliable sampling procedure, collected data can be used as an input to the model, thus providing policy-makers with the possibility to take informed decisions and actions. As an example, different relaxation strategies of the lockdown could be adopted in areas with different a-priori risk. In conclusion, our work is a first attempt to consider together different factors that can contribute to evaluate the epidemic risk in a geographical area. Better medical knowledge and available data will be important to further refine and improve the proposed methodology, which could also be easily applied to other countries. The Pearson correlation coefficients are very good, always greater than 0.95. The corresponding percentages of damages, aggregated for the three Italian macro-regions (North, Center and South (d)) are also reported to the right and can be compared with the percentages of cumulated a-priori risk (e). It is clear that our a-priori risk index is able to explain the anomalous damage discrepancies between these different parts of Italy. b a c e d Figure 5 : (a) Risk Diagram. Each region is represented as a point in the plane { \u00d7 } while the color is proportional to the level of damage in that region updated at April 2, 2020.

            "text": "This paragraph presents all the indicators we used, the rationale and references that justify their selection. Table M1 reports the data used for each region, their definition, unit of measure and relevant source. Mobility index: Commuting data are often used to correlate population mobility and the spreading of an infection (Charaudeau et al. 2014 ). On the other hand, many just published papers have monitored to what extent people are complying to issued travel restrictions (Klein et al. 2020 ) and if they are proofing to be effective in the reduction of the Covid-19 epidemic spreading (Fang et al. 2020 ). According to available data, the average trip rate of mobile population in Italy is 2.50 per day and the average distance covered is 28.5 km per day (ISFORT 2019). We characterize each region with a \"mobility index\" as the regional average of the ratio between the sum of commuting flows (incoming and outgoing) for each municipality and its employed population. The data source is the Italian Ministry of Economic Policy Planning and Coordination (www.urbanindex.it). Housing concentration: Urbanization increasingly affects the epidemiological characteristics of infectious disease (Alirool et al. 2011 , Stier et al. 2020 . Close proximity of people in their short range mobility and the attitude to use crowded public transport is amplified in compact and dense cities (Mo et al. 2020) . We capture those circumstances by the \"Housing Concentration\", measured as the ratio between the number of houses classified as \"non detached houses\" and the total number of houses. The data source is the same database cited for the mobility index. Healthcare density: Delayed hospital admission, misdiagnosis, unsuitable air conditioning systems, lack of infected patients segregation and inter-hospitals transfers, all might contribute in what it is commonly called super-spreading event (Stein 2011) . We measure the potential occurrence of this events in the infection spreading by including the \"Healthcare Density\" as the number of hospital beds per 10.000 inhabitants at regional level. Data source is the website of the Ministry of Health (http://www.dati.salute.gov.it/dati/dettaglioDataset.jsp?menu=dati&idPag=17). Pollution: Long-term exposure to air pollution may be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the COVID-19 in Europe (Ogen 2020) and in northern Italy Conticini et al. 2020) . Particulate matter (PM) is able to penetrate deeply into the respiratory tract and increase the risk of respiratory diseases (Cui et al. 2003) . According to the European Environment Agency (EEA Report No 10/2019), PM concentration in 2016 were responsible for about 374.000 premature deaths in the EU-28. Recently has been evidenced that PM10 determines a hyperactivation of JAK/STAT protein family that is associated with cells proliferation and survival (Reyes-Zar\u00e0te et al. 2016) . JAK/STAT is also hyperactivated by several cytokines generated during the Covid-19 infection (Stebbing et al. 2020) . For these reasons a strengthening mechanism between PM10 and Covid-19 infection could be assumed. Besides, very recent studies are directly correlating the population exposed to particulate pollution and the contagion from COVID-19 and the consequent health damage (Setti et al. 2020 , Pansini and Fornacca 2020 , Wu et al. 2020 . Based on these premises we decided to include the PM10 annual average of the mean daily concentration as a factor influencing the vulnerability of people exposed to the infection. The data source is WHO (https://www.who.int/airpollution/data/cities/en/), that provides measures at urban background, residential areas, commercial and mixed areas for the period 2013-2016. Temperature: Weather plays a role in the spread of 2019-nCoV (Bukhari and Jameel 2020, Pirouz et al. 2020) , although not fully established. Chan et al. (2011) report that a low temperature and low humidity environment may facilitate the virus transmission in subtropical areas during the spring and in air-conditioned environments. It is also commonly accepted that cold cuts down the defense barriers of the respiratory tracts (Chowel et al. 2012 , Makinen et al. 2009 ). We decided to include the average winter (from December 2016 to April 2017) daily mean temperature in each region as a factor potentially enhancing the individual vulnerability. The source of data is the Italian Ministry of Agriculture (https://www.politicheagricole.it/).",

We now adopt a simplification and consider the whole set of possible elements reconciled on two aspects, namely the proportion of infected individuals over the total population, which we call here infection ratio, , and the impact of consequences caused by the spreading of the disease, measured as the number of per capita hospital beds, , required by the emergency situation. Without loss of generality, we assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the aboveexplained negative role played by hospitals as contagion spreading factors, can be neglected here. Thus, define such a simplified notion of risk as : (0,1) \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 (0,1) be a , function, determined by \u2208 (0,1) and \u2208 \u211d, i.e., = ( , ). Consistently with previous analysis, we assume that The level of risk is the target variable that the policy-maker tries to minimize, given the constraint constituted by the current carrying capacity, i.e., the endowment of hospital beds ( ) financed by the expenditure in the healthcare system % . In principle, it may be considered as a dynamic variable, but we will proceed with a comparative-static analysis, by presenting policy intuitions from different initial configurations. Thus, the constraint is the result of the political orientation of the Government. In particular, let the part of the global allowance dedicated to intensive care beds, , be the sole remedy to the epidemy and define = , \u2208 (0,1). The current carrying capacity of the healthcare system, i.e. the available number of hospital beds, is the function \u2236 (0,1) , \u00d7 \u2115 \u00d7 \u211d \u2192 (0,1), defined as = \u2212 \u210e , where \u210e = (1 \u2212 ) and is the population of the district under consideration. In per capita terms, it can be rewritten as = % \u2212 \u210e , with = / and % = / . Within a comparative statics perspective, for any given couple ( , ) we can consider a reduced form of the carrying capacity constraint, depending on the infection diffusion rate as a negatively sloped line in the plane (infection ratio, hospital beds), where also the convex contours of the risk function can be considered. It is worth to notice that the model refers to the variable hospital beds in both demand, , and supply, , terms. All in all, the proposed framework matches required and available beds per infection ratio. Policies may try to affect and can effectively tune , by adjusting and % , in such a way that the exploitation of available resources allows the minimization of , at least, a tangency point between the capacity constraint and the risk level.",

The geographical distribution of the six risk factors (a-f) can be compared with the COVID-19 total cases (g), the total deaths (h) and the intensive care occupancy (i). Cases and deaths have been cumulated up to April 2, 2020; the intensive care data represent the values registered at that day. The risk indicators have been multiplied for the population of each region and normalized between 0 and 1 (the color scale for temperature has been reversed, i.e. dark colors mean low temperatures, see Methods) A concentration of dark colors in the northern regions is roughly visible for almost all the indicators and the correlations between the single factors and the damages range from 0.70 to 0.95.

(a) A-priori normalized risk ranking of Italian regions, emerging from our analysis of risk indicators, compared with the corresponding total cases, deaths and intensive care occupancy updated at April 2, 2020. Regions are organized in groups of colors, according to the total cases registered. Data referring to overestimations or underestimations of risk are also colored in green and red, respectively.

The geographical correlation with the risk map is evident for both kind of the epidemic flus. The three main damage indicators for COVID-19 -the total number of cases (a), the total number of deaths (b) and the intensive care occupancy (c) -updated at April 2, 2020, are reported as function of the a-priori risk index for all the Italian regions.
