The severity of infection varies from mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe pneumonia. Up to 40 % of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and as many as 18 % of cases requiring hospitalizations in children have been the result of M. pneumoniae infection [1]. Macrolides remain the initial therapy of M. pneumoniae infection [2]. However, increasing numbers of macrolide-resistant (MR) M. pneumoniae have been reported in the past decade [3\u20136]. An A to G/C transition at position 2063 or 2064 of the gene resulted in high-level macrolide resistance of the M. pneumoniae strain, whereas a C to G or C to A mutation at position 2617 was associated with a lower resistance to macrolides [7].",

In this study, the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae pneumonia was based on clinical symptoms with lower respiratory tract infection and laboratory results with positive M. pneumoniae DNA using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was performed using a M. pneumoniae attachment protein P1 Primer Set Kit targeted at the P1 gene of M. pneumoniae. If the threshold cycle (Ct) value of PCR for the P1 gene was less than 35, the copy of DNA could be enough for DNA sequencing [12]. Informed consent was obtained from the patients when Ct value of PCR was less than 35. Further detection of macrolide resistance was performed afterward. The Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital approved the study (CGMH 99-3224B and 99-4129B).",

The discrepancy of a significant difference of hospital stay in Table 2 using Student\u2019s t test versus a nonsignificant difference according to Kaplan\u2013Meier methodology was noted because the former considers the difference of mean values of hospital stay whereas the latter concerns difference of cumulative percentage (Fig. 1a).

The more frequent use of doxycycline in this study possibly reflects the attitudes of primary care physicians. Patients who suffered from persistent fever after azithromycin treatment became afebrile after doxycycline treatment, and no treatment failure occurred. Doxycyline seems to have a good therapeutic effect for macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae infection in pediatric patients. However, the effect of tetracycline in children with MR M. pneumoniae infection still warrants more prospective studies.",

(1) Patients enrolled into this study were from a single tertiary center in northern Taiwan, and thus the results cannot be extrapolated to the general population in Taiwan. Further, the statistical power was low because of the small number of patients. (2) We did not include all mycoplasmal pneumonia patients. The choice of patient population depended on the Ct value of PCR and the willingness of the parent. (3) Critical patients who required intensive care were excluded for analysis, so that only mild cases with mycoplasmal infections were recruited in this study; thus, the true prevalence of M. pneumoniae may be underestimated. Further prospective and large-scale studies are needed to resolve this uncertainty.",
