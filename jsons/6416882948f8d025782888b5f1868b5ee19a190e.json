Excellent communication is an important factor in delivering good 32 rare disease support. Training for health professionals was also highlighted as an essential element of 33 improving support for those with a rare disease to ensure they approach people with these unique and 34 challenging diseases in an appropriate way. Carers were mentioned several times throughout the 35 study; it is often felt they are overlooked in rare disease research and more support should be in place 36 for them. Current care/support for those with a rare disease was highlighted as inadequate. Nine In Europe, diseases that affect less than 1 in 2000 individuals are considered 'rare' [1] .

An important finding to consider in future research within the rare 44 disease field is the inclusion of carers perceptions and experiences in studies.

All of the groups surveyed or interviewed offer those with a rare 437 disease various means of communicating from helplines, to social media and websites. Collaborative 438 groups acknowledged the difficulties that are often experienced when trying to organise face to face 439 meetings. This is largely due to the nature of rare diseases and the unpredictable symptoms 440 experienced on a planned date. It seems there is a move away from this type of support towards online 441 platforms and remote access to in-person / virtual meetings.442 443Social isolation is a consistently recurring theme for those with a rare disease, and the internet offers a 444 practical solution particularly in rural areas[7, 30]. Many of those living with a rare disease find 445 belonging by being part of an online support group or blog[31]. Although the merits of social media are many, it is important to consider the reality that many people do not regularly access 447 online services and so there is a chance that people could be missed, as raised by participant 7. The 448 most common social media platform used by groups was Facebook, followed by Twitter.As in 449 agreement with Lasker et al. (2005) social media was found to be used for 'sharing information about 450 the specific rare disease' and 'communication with other organisations' groups said they would be interested in collaborating with relevant groups to develop 453 complementary information resources. This is an idea which should be developed to bring services 454 together and provide a clear pathway for rare disease patients. Listening to patients was also raised 455 as an issue in this study by collaborative groups as many patients do not feel the communication 456 between themselves and health professionals is good enough. Jeppeson et al. (2014) also found this, 457 stating that gaining an insight into how someone copes with the day to day life of living with a rare 458 disease would enable a deeper understanding and encourage more sympathetic communication [12]. 459 Rare disease patients often experience a shift in their relationship with health professionals as they and 460 their carers take on the role as the 'experts' [32]. Budych et al. (2012) have shown improved outcomes 461 will result from care providers recognising and acknowledging patient's expertise and being willing to 462 partner with them in the decision making around treatment [33]. Many collaborative groups discussed 463 how having health professionals on board with their work would help to champion and promote set out four priorities within their vision as a charity. The first is 'Connecting': Stronger 467 Together; Outreach to the rare disease community in Northern Ireland; Tackling disadvantage and 468 inequality; Reaching out to those living and working with rare disease elsewhere in the UK and Ireland, 469 and across the world [20]. From this element of the charities vision it is apparent that communication 470 is an important aspect of the work they do within Northern Ireland which supports the need those with a rare disease requires training. The majority of groups who were part 475 of this study are involved with training health care professionals with several having developed/co-et al. (2013) among others highlighted the lack of knowledge of general 479 practitioners on the topic of rare diseases and suggested a web-based module might increase their 480 knowledge of the specific disease, generic complications (e.g. providing respiratory support is 481 necessary for multiple rare diseases) and improve patient care [34]. Multiple groups explained that they 482 organise training days for healthcare professionals and specific disciplines such as physiotherapists, 483 occupational therapists, hospice staff and unofficial talks and training for schools, teachers and families. 484 A central online resource listing such events would be beneficial to many people. The UK strategy for 485 Rare Diseases emphasised the need for improvement of the coordination of care, diagnosisand initiatives are in place, the GP community still do not feel adequately equipped to 489 deal with rare disease with many frequently consulting online databases such as Google, Orphanet and 490 Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [35]. Fern\u00e1ndez Avellaneda et al. (2006), investigated 491 the need for rare disease training in primary care [36]. Difficulties arose in understanding the 492 importance and magnitude of rare diseases, supporting the findings of the current study that further 493 training is required. Ramalle-Gomara et al. (2014) conducted a survey with 234 students and found 494 that only around 25% of them knew the definition of rare disease and an orphan drug, again highlighting 495 the need for training and awareness raising [37, 38].

New insights are added to the existing body of 573 knowledge on rare disease, highlighting the need for future research including carers and more training 574 for health professionals regarding communication for rare disease. The surveys and interviews 575 conducted with rare disease collaborative groups have provided insight into the support available for 576 rare disease patients in Northern Ireland and have identified the gaps in services. From this information 577 it has become obvious that many valuable services exist for rare disease patients and that those 578 providing these are extremely passionate and dedicated to the work that they do. A clear area to target 579 would be communication, there appears to be a disconnect between statutory and voluntary services 580 and a better link would improve the care provided for rare disease patients. Access to services for 581 those who are geographically more distant or are not well enough to attend events is also an area worth 582 targeting.

The survey was open to all charities, voluntary and community groups providing services for people 110 living and working with rare diseases across Northern Ireland and anyone from within the group was 111 eligible to answer the survey. Detailed survey responses are provided in Additional file 2. Rare disease 112 collaborative groups were named in the survey to ensure no overlap where multiple representatives 113 may have responded on behalf of a single group; there was no overlap in group names for individual 114 responses. All groups provided services to individuals living and working with rare diseases in Northern 115 Ireland and were established between 1980s to 2017. The majority were registered charities in the UK,",

While only 126 14% of groups offer a 24-hour helpline, 41% offer an office-based telephone helpline during the day 127 with 86% of groups offering some form of contact-response option. Ninety-four percent of groups have 128 a dedicated social media representative, while half of groups surveyed had a named information or 129 communication manager, and 68% have a branch or contact person located in Northern Ireland. For 130 many rare disease collaborative groups, improved resources to have 'better' helpline services were 131 described as 'very important'. As additional figure displays the supportive networking options provide by many groups to help connect 134 people [see Additional file 3].

Only one of the groups surveyed does not have a website, the remainder described their website as 139 benefitting anyone affected by a rare disease or is worried about a loved one. Groups differed in terms 140 of when websites were updated, with just four groups providing daily updates and the majority (62%) 141 ad hoc as new information is available and personnel resources permit. Two groups have information 142 resources meeting NHS England's information standard [23], while two have information approved by 143 medical advisors.

There was an 598 agreed consensus that the services for rare disease patients in Northern Ireland are not adequate.Further research should be conducted with rare disease collaborative groups, specifically it would 601 interesting to get the views of those accessing these services. Research focusing on carers would also 602 be useful as to date no research studies focus solely on them. Interestingly, many studies have been 603 conducted on carers for cancer [52, 53, 54]. The lack of research suggests that a difference exists 604 between cancer caring support options and those for rare disease patients. Families living with rare 605 diseases have traditionally received little attention from health authorities, clinicians and researchers 606 [44].
