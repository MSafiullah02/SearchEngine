In China, there is a Spring Festival travel rush (\u201cchunyun\u201d) [4] every year, and migrants customarily return to their birthplace for the celebration. There is a 40-day period with a very large surge in transportation across China, which began on January 10, 2020 [5]. In the national transmission of COVID-19, the return of asymptomatic patients to their birthplace resulted in the widespread transmission of the disease, according to existing reports from the websites of health commissions. For example, in Harbin city, which is 2000 km away from Wuhan, the confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections that occurred before February 15 included 15 people who returned to Harbin from Wuhan. After that, the cluster of disease occurrences involved 111 cases, accounting for 79.3% of confirmed cases. To prevent COVID-19 from rapidly spreading with population movements, the Wuhan Municipal Government completely closed the city at 10:00 a.m. on January 23, 2020. Nevertheless, approximately 5 million people still left Wuhan, and large-scale migration activity may be an important cause of the long-term expansion of this disease. ",

Networks can be used to represent the patterns of connectivity of populations, and therefore describe aspects of disease transmission that depart from the mean field model [7,8,9]. This directional network transmission through intensified travel and migration renders political borders and geographical distance irrelevant and creates further possibilities for disease transmission [10,11,12,13,14], especially in the early disease growth phase. Network models usually show less variation and higher accuracy [15]. Existing research on the disease transmission network has predicted the transmission of a disease through small-scale population surveys [16] and traffic volume [17,18,19,20,21,22]. Part of the current research on COVID-19 also includes traffic forecasts from Wuhan [5]. However, the Chinese migration in the spring may involve other forms of transportation that are both public and private. Therefore, disease transmission cannot be predicted by a single transportation method. Recent related studies on COVID-19 are focused on predicting the number of people who have the disease [4,23,24,25]; in contrast, studies of the transmission and spatial distribution of COVID-19 in China are very scarce.",

(2) How can policies for similar emerging epidemic scenarios be formulated? Based on these questions, we used the China Migrant Population monitoring data 2017 (CMDS 2017) (Sample size = 432,907) to construct a network called Residence place\u2013Birthplace probability matrix (R-B matrix) to predict migrant influx and outflow migration. An empirical study was then performed using COVID-19 transmission as an example, and compared the advantages of using the R-B matrix with population or population density to predict disease transmission. Then, we simulated the outbreak scenario in the immigrant cities with the highest migrant population in China, and put forward some risk prevention measures after an emerging epidemic outbreak in the future.",

The use of the two sets of migration probabilities is helpful to formulate the post-disease spatially differential control policy. According to our forecast, as shown in Figure 2, in Kunming, Hefei, and Changsha cities, most of the migration originates from the province or nearby cities, which has little impact on other cities in China and is relatively simple to control. However, in Wenzhou, Guangzhou [34], Dongguan, Shenzhen, or other cities, most of the migrant population originates from different provinces that are distributed all over China. Therefore, there is a wide range of diffusion, and it has a large impact on other cities and is relatively difficult to control.

We identified these high-risk node cities in Figure 3. On the one hand, most migrant birthplace regions tend to be economically and socially underdeveloped, with large birth populations, and are important nodes in the network of emerging epidemic [16,33]. By constructing a matrix, we identified these important migrant birthplaces by pa,j\u2190, and predicted the overall risk of transmission to other cities under the same circumstances if similar emerging epidemic scenarios occur in other large immigrant cities. The results in Figure 3 show that the regions with the highest probability are in the center of China, and these cities are located in Henan and Anhui provinces, which are economically underdeveloped but have large populations. On the other hand, some important migrant concentration node cities calculated through the index pa,j\u2192 are also worth noting. These cities are often world-class global cities with more developed economies and very close links with other immigrant cities in China. Figure 3 shows that these cities with high risk include Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chongqing. Therefore, in general, it is most effective to make emergency plans for these high-risk node regions under disease spread situations.",

(2) Carrying out the construction of emergency isolation facilities (such as temporary infectious disease hospitals or reconstruction plans), plans for the control and isolation of populations returning to their hometowns, plans for suspension of school and work [1], and strict adherence to universal precautions in health care settings are critical in controlling the transmission of disease through isolation measures in these node cities.5.

Then, we used this R-B matrix to simulate an outbreak scenario in 22 immigrant cities in China, and proposed risk prevention measures after the outbreak. It was found that similar emerging epidemic scenarios would occur in the cities of Wenzhou, Guangzhou, Dongguan, or Shenzhen, with a wider disease transmission. We also used the matrix to determine that cities in Henan province, Anhui province, and Municipalities (such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing) have a high risk level of disease carriers after the outbreak due to a high influx or outflow of people. Thus, we should give priority to formulating policies that will ensure that an emergency response plan is launched first after the occurrence of a similar emerging epidemic outbreak to check, control, and isolate people who leave or return after the outbreak.

First, the method in this study was only obtained from the perspective of the migrant population, but a small proportion of the registered population also returned to their birthplace during the Spring Festival after the outbreak of the disease. Second, COVID-19 was transmitted by cross-provincial, cross-city, and trans-national travel. In addition, inadequate criteria for early outbreaks may have contributed to some of the errors in the number of people diagnosed, and therefore, further research is needed. However, the migrant population contributed greatly to disease spread, and we believe that limiting migration and isolating people is one of the most effective ways to control an emerging epidemic.

It is hoped that by providing simple and accurate approximations, a constantly evolving understanding of the complexity of the real world will be gained, and the method can continue to assist in understanding and controlling diseases.
