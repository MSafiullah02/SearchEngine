A 2011 flood in Thailand inundated 877 factories (Baker & Lui, 2012), halted 30% of the hard-disk manufacturing industry (Punter, 2013) and caused billions of dollars in losses for the PC industry. A drought in the US Midwest in 2012 damaged crop yields, sent crop prices soaring, and hit food producers, especially meat and dairy producers (Taylor, 2012). Each year, nature can thwart companies dependent on the smooth operations of their global supply chains.",

An explosion at a German chemical factory, for instance, caused carmakers around the world to suddenly face potential disruptions of thousands of different parts used on every vehicle they made (Trudell, Kishan, & Naughton, 2012). When a barge on the Rhine River capsized, the river was closed for 20 days, delaying 450 barges and hindering the 170 million metric tons of goods shipped on the river annually (Havoc, 2011). In a third example, a toymaker suffered a highly publicized recall of 1.5 million lead-tainted toys after a paint supplier to a contract manufacturer had to find a second source for pigments but did not have time for testing (Mattel\u2019s, 2007).

Furthermore, they assign nonlinear numerical values to the levels.

The rationale for this pattern of levels is that impacts (e.g., \u201cWhat happens if Supplier X can\u2019t ship for 2 months?\u201d) are often easier to assess than likelihoods (\u201cWhat is the probability that something will disrupt Supplier X?\u201d) and therefore are given a higher weight.",

Companies often have little knowledge of these deep-tier suppliers and, in most cases, have almost no influence over them to demand more resilience or adherence to any code of conduct. This trend causes the geographic risk footprint of a company to expand beyond its own facilities to encompass the facilities of distributors and customers downstream in the supply chain as well as to suppliers\u2014at multiple tiers\u2014upstream. Accordingly, significant supply-chain disruptions are inevitable.",

The central fallacy that creates black swans is that a lack of evidence of a possible disruption does not constitute evidence of lack of that possible disruption. Events such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the 2008 financial crisis are often cited as examples of these kinds of disruptions. By definition, the likelihood and impacts of a black swan are underestimated (or never estimated) under the mistaken belief that the event cannot happen or is not even conceived of its possibility. Black swans reflect a deeper kind of uncertainty than standard likelihood models because experts misjudge the likelihood of a black swan risk to be zero when, in fact, it is not. In essence, even the most thorough risk model misses some risks.",

Yet the examples also highlight the limitations of these models in terms of availability of fine-grained data on suppliers, especially those with no direct relationship with the company. Nonetheless, even if exact quantitative models are not practical, companies can understand and prioritize risks at a qualitative level. A company can understand such risks through a deeper understanding of the company\u2019s dependency on particular categories of deep supply-chain structures such as those related to natural resources (geographic concentrations, price volatility, environmental reputation risks), labor in developing countries (geopolitical and reputation risks), and technological or specialty materials produced by a very narrow or clustered supply base.

Thus the research community has to keep up with both the risks and the responses (as well as the business opportunities hidden in many disruptions), helping laggard companies be better prepared. An area which can benefit from further research is the development of risk metrics and indices, helping companies assess suppliers, regions, network nodes, and customers in terms of the risk they pose.
