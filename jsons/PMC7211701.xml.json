            "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has its homologue, ACE2 discovered in 2000 as a ACE related caroxypeptidase not inhibited by captopril [1,2]. ACE2 was firstly shown to be expressed in the kidneys of both the normotensive and the spontaneously hypertensive rat strains [3]. Subsequent studies demonstrated down-regulation of renal ACE2 in three different models of hypertension [4]. Moreover, circulating and cardiac levels of angiotensin II (AT-II) were shown to increase in the ACE2-null mice. ACE2 is the principal pathway for Ang- [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]] formation from AT-II (Ang-1-8), protecting against excessive activation of AT1 receptor in the heart tissues, However, newer findings suggested that ACE2 can be an important element in the renin\u2013angiotensin aldosterone system [5]. Following these studies, ACE and ACE2 focused the attention of researchers for their contribution in diverse human disorders. Recently, the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) outbreak which has affected people all over the world has further highlighted the role of ACE2. This virus has about 80% sequence identity with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) and 96% sequence identity to a bat coronavirus. Most remarkably, SARS-COV-2 was shown to utilize the similar cell entry receptor ACE2 as SARS-CoV [6,7]. A recent study has shown that the ACE2-binding pocket for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is almost identical to this one of SARS-CoV RBD. Structural protein modeling led to identification of amino acid residues in SARS-CoV-2 RBD that critical in ACE2 binding. Notably, most of these residues are either highly conserved or have comparable side chain chemical properties with the SARS-CoV RBD. This similarity of the structure and amino acid sequence stimulated intensive debate on the convergent evolution of these viruses RBDs under a pressure of enhanced binding to ACE2 [8]. ACE2 has been shown to be expressed as a membrane bound protein in several human tissues such as lung, intestine, heart and kidney. The surface expression of this protein on was demonstrated on ciliated bronchial cells and on the lung alveolar epithelial cells but also in endothelial cells, which was stated a noticeable discovery [9]. Moreover, a recent in silico analysis of RNA-seq profiles verified expression of ACE2 in the mucosa of oral cavity [10].",

Moreover, injecting SARS-CoV spike into mice has led to down-regulation of ACE2, thus aggravating the lung injury [16,17]. Consequently, ACE2 functions as the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV entrance but also confers a protective mechanism against lung injury [18]. Based on these investigations, level of expression of ACE2 is an important factor in the SARS-CoV infection. Thus, comorbid conditions that influence expression of this protein might affect severity of disease.

Associations between these polymorphisms and human disorders have been assessed in different populations. The ACE gene I/D polymorphism, 287-bp sequence insertion or deletion of DNA in intron 16 (rs4340, rs4646994), is perhaps the most studied polymorphism in this regard. Being associated with the onset and course of diabetic nephropathy [55,56], the I/D genotype is regarded as a determinant of ACE expression levels in plasma, cells, and tissues [[57], [58], [59]]. Moreover, the ACE2 rs2074192 and rs2106809 polymorphisms have been associated with lower levels of circulating AT- [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]] [60]. Table 3\nshows the results studies which assessed the association between ACE polymorphisms and human disorders.",

Besides, ACE2 has a protective role against acute respiratory distress syndrome. Thus, it can be concluded that decreased ACE2 level contributes to severe consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, while ACE2 is essential for the virus-cell fusion. One explanation for this controversy is a viral-induced transitional overexpression of ACE2 at the first stage of the infection [98]. However, a recent in silico analysis of sex bias severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not support the association between ACE2 genetic variants and disease severity/sex bias in the Italian population.

Different levels of expression and function of the ACE proteins, underlying disorders such as diabetes and hypertension, administration of certain medications, especially ACE inhibitors and calcitriol, and the existence of certain genomic variants within ACE genes that modulate function or expression of the encoded proteins are possible explanations for the observed difference in the response of individuals to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Exploration of the role of these factors can lead to design of appropriate therapeutic modalities based on the personalized risks. Such personalized approach is expected to be more effective. Exploitation of the next generation sequencing methods at both genomic and transcriptomic levels would be a practical strategy in this regard.",

            "text": "Fig. 1: The first step of conversion of angiotensinogen (AT) to AT-I is catalyzed by renin. Then, ACE converts AT-I to AT-II. Finally, ACE2 cleaves AT-II to produce AT- [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]. AT-II can bind with AT1R to initiate inflammation and fibrosis in lung tissue. However, binding of AT- [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]] with MasR inhibits this process. SARS-CoVs exploits ACE2 for their entrance into the cells. A transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 has a crucial role in activation of the fusion of a virus with cell membrane. Moreover, the Furin protease which is proconvertase physiologically required to activate proteins in the Golgi apparatus mediates proteolysis of the spike protein S2 subunit, a unique feature for SARS-CoV-2 [11]. ACE2 levels are decreased in SARS-CoV infected cells leading to increase in AT-II and decrease in AT- [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]] levels. Based on receptor effects of these proteins mediated by AT1R and MasR, these two alterations have synergic effects on induction of lung fibrosis. Moreover, AT-II has a role in degradation of ACE2 through ubiquitination [12]. SARS-CoVs also enhance expression levels of miR-200c-3p and miR-429 in the infected cells, both of them being regarded as ACE2 targeting miRNAs [13,14] (ACE: angiotensin converting enzyme, ACEi: ACE inhibitor, AT: angiotensinogen, ARB: Angiotensin II receptor blocker).",
