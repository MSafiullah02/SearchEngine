For set A, one tube with RV16 PC 1 and the other with RV16 PC 2 were used. For B set, one tube with RV16 PC 1 and the other with RV16 PC 2 were used. TOCE assay was conducted using the CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, CA) under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min and 50 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 60 \u00b0C for 1 min, and 72 \u00b0C for 30 s. The fluorophores used were FAM, HEX, Cal Red 610 and Quasar 670. After reaction, Catcher Melting Temperature Analysis (CMTA) was performed by cooling the reaction mixture to 55 \u00b0C, holding at 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, and heating from 55 \u00b0C to 85 \u00b0C. The fluorescence was measured continuously during the temperature rise, while the melting peaks were derived from the initial fluorescence (F) versus temperature (T) curves. The melting-temperature analysis was done by Seegene viewer software.11\n",
