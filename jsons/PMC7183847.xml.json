In addition to our article, several authors, including two editors, commented on the advantages and challenges of the WT screening system in the previous issue.234 For these comments, we did not only describe the advantages and the risks of the WT system but also how we ensured the safety of testees. Contrary to our intentions, however, the risks seem to have emerged more in previous editorials and opinion, so we felt the need to re-inform the contents of our article on how to compensate for the risks as described below.",

By reviewing the guidelines of the CDC, World Health Organization, and Korea CDC, we found a safe and effective disinfectant. The disinfectant we found has sufficient germicidal ability against all types of viruses, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with a contact time of 1 minute. It also has tuberculocidal ability with a contact time of 5 minutes.7 According to CDC Guidelines for environmental infection control in health-care facilities, the use of the tuberculocidal surface disinfectant will not prevent the transmission of tuberculosis in healthcare-setting because tuberculosis is not acquired from environmental surfaces. The tuberculocidal claim means which has the capability of inactivation a broad spectrum of pathogens.8 This product is not classified as hazardous according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 29CFR 1910.1200 (HazCom 2012-GHS) and Canadian Hazardous Products Regulations (WHMIS 2015-GHS). We described that ventilation time was 5 minutes after surface disinfection to maintain sufficient contact time, and because of the use of multiple booths, approximately 30 minutes of ventilation per booth was achieved. The outer gloves were replaced with each patient after 5 minutes of ventilation to the patient exit. And then, we wiped the inner surface and inner gloves of the booth with a disinfectant simultaneously. The inner gloves were also replaced when an abnormality was found.",
