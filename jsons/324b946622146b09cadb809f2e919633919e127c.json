OC; amantadine + OC; TCAD. Viruses were screened for V27A, A30T and S31N amantadine-resistance substitutions. A similar experiment was conducted with serial passaging in the presence of escalating concentrations of: amantadine; OC; ZNV; ribavirin; amantadine + OC; amantadine + ZNV; TCAD. Passaging was continued until TC 50 for each drug as a single agent was achieved or \u226525 days had passed. The contribution of each component of TCAD to the suppression of resistance was determined by passaging the virus five times in MDCK cells in the presence of double combinations, with increasing concentrations of a third drug titrated into the double combinations. Virus-induced cytopathic effect was In the presence of TCAD, there was sustained suppression of drug resistant viruses. With amantadine alone or the amantadine-OC double combination, rapid selection of resistant variants was observed (\u223c100% of the population). Treatment with all three double combinations resulted in 75-100% virus breakthrough (>50% cytopathic effect). Titration of each drug into the appropriate double combination (at levels equivalent to those that are achievable clinically) resulted in the concentration-dependent decrease in virus breakthrough.In vitro. MDCK cells infected with three A(H1N1)pdm09 strains as described above.To determine single agent concentration response curves, concentrations of amantadine and ribavirin ranged from 0\u00b7001 to 100 \u00b5g/mL and OC concentration ranged from 0\u00b7000032 to 100 \u00b5g/mL. EC 50 determination, combination agent studies, and a modified synergy analysis were performed. Amantadine, ribavirin and OC were also tested as single agents and in combination against additional amantadine-and OC-resistant viruses: A/Caledonia/20/99(H1N1) [V27A]; A/Duck/1525/81(H5N1) [A30T]; A/Mississippi/3/01(H1N1) [H274Y]; A/Hawaii/21/07(H1N1)TCAD demonstrated synergistic effect against all three A(H1N1) strains, for all three agents (\u22650\u00b71 \u00b5g/mL amantadine; \u22650\u00b732 \u00b5g/mL ribavirin; \u22650\u00b70032 \u00b5g/mL OC). Amantadine <3\u00b72 \u00b5g/mL was reported to have no significant antiviral activity as a single agent but contributed to TCAD activity. Synergy for TCAD was greater than synergy for double NAI combinations. Addition of each third agent to a double combination was shown to contribute to synergy. Against OC-and amantadine-resistant viruses, OC and amantadine were shown to contribute to the synergistic effect of TCAD, respectively. No enhanced cytotoxicitty was observed.
