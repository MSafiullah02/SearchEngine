            "text": "Coronavirus infections have emerged in various species of mammals and birds and are generally associated with a wide spectrum of respiratory, intestinal and systemic infections. Feline coronaviruses (FCoV) can cause both enteric and systemic diseases in domestic and wild Felidae and occur as two pathotypes for which the disease-causing potential is determined by their cell tropism. The feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) is an enzootic enteropathogenic virus that replicates in intestinal epithelial cells after oral uptake [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Most infections with FECV are subclinical and rarely give rise to symptoms such as mild diarrhoea or reduced appetite [5] . The highly virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) arises within an individual cat by mutations in the FECV genome, which enables efficient viral replication in monocytes and macrophages [6] [7] [8] [9] . FIPV spreads systemically and causes the highly fatal disease known as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP), which is characterized by a fibrinous and granulomatous serositis, fibrinous effusions in the affected body cavities and/or multifocal granulomatous vascular lesions in several organs [10] [11] [12] . Besides these two pathotypes, two FCoV serotypes can be distinguished. Serotype I FCoVs are most prevalent in the field [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , but difficult to grow in vitro. To date, the only cell line that allows sustainable growth of serotype I FCoV strains is a feline intestinal epithelial cell (fIEC) line established by Desmarets and colleagues [19] . The less prevalent serotype II FCoV arose by double recombination between serotype I FCoV and canine coronavirus (CCoV), resulting in a FCoV with spike and open reading frame 3 (ORF3) sequences of CCoV origin [20, 21] .",

            "text": "The FCoV genome consists of a single-stranded positivesense RNA strand of about 29 kb that codes for 16 non-structural, 4 structural and 5 accessory proteins. ORF3 encodes accessory proteins 3a, 3b and 3 c. The ORF3-encoded proteins do not seem to be essential for sustainable growth in vitro in Felis catus whole foetus cells and feline blood monocytes [22, 23] , although virus titres were markedly lower after the inoculation of feline blood monocytes with a FIPV ORF3 deletion mutant compared to the wild-type [22] . Moreover, inoculation of cats with recombinant FIPV lacking ORF3 failed to induce typical FIP clinical signs. This loss of virulence in vivo suggests a potential role of the ORF3-encoded proteins in virus-host interactions [23] . The FCoV 3b amino acid sequence comprises about 72 amino acid residues and is well conserved within pathotypes [24] . It was recently reported that 3b localizes to mitochondria and nucleoli, both in the presence and absence of other viral proteins [25] . However, the function(s) of this accessory protein remain unknown. Interestingly, the accessory 3b protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which comprises 154 amino acids, also translocates to mitochondria and nucleoli [26] [27] [28] , even though it does not share any amino acid sequence homology with FCoV 3b. SARS-CoV 3b induces apoptosis [29, 30] , necrosis [29] and cell-cycle arrest [30] , and suppresses type I IFN expression induced by retinoic acid-induced gene 1 and the mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS) [26] .",

            "text": "Many viral proteins are known to target the nucleolus and may interfere with cellular stress responses, cell cycle regulation and apoptotic processes. In addition, these proteins can modify cellular and viral transcription or recruit specific nucleolar components, such as nucleolin, to facilitate viral replication (reviewed in [31] [32] [33] [34] ). Upon synthesis in the cytoplasm, nucleolar proteins first migrate to the nucleus and then subsequently to the nucleolus. Small soluble proteins can passively diffuse from the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleoplasm (reviewed in [35] [36] [37] ). Transport of larger proteins to the nucleus, however, is an ATP-dependent active process driven by nuclear localization signals (NLSs), which are typically characterized by clusters of basic amino acids (reviewed in [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] ). These NLSs are recognized by importins that mediate transport into the nucleus. Similarly, shuttling of proteins from the nucleus back to the cytoplasm is established by nuclear export signals (NESs) that are recognized by exportins such as CRM1. Nucleolar import of proteins can be achieved through association with nucleolar components such as rRNA or nucleolar proteins [32, 34, 43, 44] . For various proteins, a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) was identified that targets these proteins to the nucleoli. However, NoLSs are not well characterized and no consensus motif is available. In general, they display a high content of basic residues and thus resemble or incorporate NLSs (reviewed in [32-34, 44, 45] ). Viral proteins that target mitochondria have been implicated in Ca 2+ homeostasis, energy production and apoptosis. Furthermore, such proteins can cause oxidative stress and modulate the mitochondrial membrane permeability and potential, and antiviral responses that emanate from a mitochondria-associated complex such as MAVS. Some of these viral proteins mimic or hijack mitochondrial proteins to their advantage, or alter the dynamics or intracellular localization of mitochondria (reviewed in [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] ). Most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes, synthesized in the cytosol and subsequently imported into mitochondria. This process is typically driven by an N-terminal cleavable presequence, the mitochondrial targeting peptide (mTP), which interacts with the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex, more specifically with the Tom20 and Tom22 proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane (reviewed in [51, 52] ). Even though a consensus sequence for these mTPs has not been established, there are common features with respect to amino acid composition and physicochemical properties. For example, mitochondrial targeting peptides are often rich in positively charged residues, such as arginine, almost always lack negatively charged residues and generally have the ability to form amphipathic \u03b1-helices with hydrophobic residues on one side and positively charged residues on the other [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . The hydrophobic surface is recognized by Tom20 and the positively charged surface interacts with Tom22 [59] [60] [61] . Upon import into the mitochondrial matrix, the N-terminal presequence is cleaved off by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP) and the protein subsequently translocates to one of the submitochondrial compartments [51] .",

Next, CRFK cells were transfected with these constructs and the subcellular distribution pattern was evaluated by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1c) .

Transfection of the p3b-EGFP expression vector resulted in a dotted or tubular distribution in the cytoplasm. Visualization of the mitochondria using MitoTracker Red CMXRos clearly demonstrated that FCoV 3b-EGFP colocalizes with this organelle (Fig. 2) .

Western blot analysis using anti-GFP antibodies showed the migration of chimeric proteins at the expected molecular mass of approximately 36 kDa (Fig. 1b) . These results are in line with the observations from Meszaros and colleagues, who investigated the subcellular localization of all FCoV ORF3-encoded proteins [25] .

Similar results were obtained as for the EGFP fusion proteins, i.e. mitochondrial and nucleolar expression for p3b-3\u00d7FLAG and only nucleolar expression for p3\u00d7FLAG-3b (Fig. 3c) . The fluorescent signal was, however, weaker compared to EGFP. In addition, these EGFP and 3\u00d7FLAG constructs were also introduced in fIECs to exclude cell type-dependent localization of 3b. These fIECs are in fact the target cells for FECV and to date the only cell line in which serotype I strains can be propagated in vitro [19] . Even though the transfection efficiency is quite low in this epithelial cell line, the 3b expression pattern was comparable to that observed in CRFK cells (Fig. 4) . From these results, we can conclude that the 3b localization is not influenced by the fusion protein or tag to which it was fused nor by the cell type in which the protein is expressed, and thus most likely represents the actual subcellular localization of FCoV 3b. Furthermore, it was shown by Meszaros and colleagues that the 3b expression pattern did not change when transfection was followed by infection with FIPV DF-2, although 3b accumulation in the nucleolus was more frequently observed in infected cells compared to transfection only [25] .",

            "text": "Proteins that target the nucleolus first migrate to the nucleus and then subsequently to the nucleolus. The active transportation of proteins through the nuclear pore complex is usually driven by NLSs. Classical NLSs include the monopartite pat4 and pat7 motifs and the bipartite motif (reviewed in [38, 40, 41, 71] ). The pat4 motif is a continuous stretch of four basic amino acid residues (arginine or lysine) [\u03b2 4 ] or three basic amino acid residues followed by a histidine or proline [\u03b2 3 (H/P)]. The pat7 motif starts with a proline and is followed, within three residues, by a basic four-residue cluster containing at least three arginines or lysines [P\u03c7\u03c7(\u03b2 3 \u03c7)]. Bipartite NLSs have 2 clusters of basic amino acids separated by a 10-12 amino acid-long spacer, where the first cluster consists of 2 basic residues and the second cluster is a basic 5-residue region consisting of at least 3 basic residues [\u03b2\u03b2\u03c7 (10) (11) (12) (\u03b2 3 \u03c7 2 )] [72, 73] . NLS diversity keeps expanding as non-classical NLSs (reviewed in [38] ) and additional NLS classes have been identified [74] . It should be noted that, in the absence of an NLS, proteins can still localize to the nucleus by co-transportation with other proteins that contain an NLS [75, 76] . In addition, the presence of an NLS does not guarantee nuclear localization, as the NLS may be masked from the protein surface (reviewed in [42] ). NoLSs that drive nucleolar targeting are poorly characterized and usually closely associated with NLSs, thereby hampering the identification of a consensus motif. It is important, however, to differentiate between (1) NLS-only signals, which will target proteins to the nucleus but not to nucleoli, (2) NoLS-only signals, which will translocate proteins to the nucleoli, but are not capable of transporting them through the nuclear pore complex, and (3) joint NoLS-NLS signals, which will target the proteins to the nucleus and subsequently induce nucleolar accumulation [45] .",

In addition, a Hopp-Woods hydrophilicity plot (Fig. 5b) shows that these overlapping pat4 motifs are located in a hydrophilic region and therefore the surface should be easily accessible for interaction with importins. To investigate if these residues are conserved amongst different strains, 178 (putative) serotype I FCoV 3b protein sequences were compared. All of them contained at least one pat4 motif in the same region. Thirteen (7.30 %) had a single pat4 motif and 165 (92.7 %) had 2 overlapping pat4 motifs. There is a 90 % amino acid homology between the 3b sequence described by Meszaros and colleagues (isolate HU2009FC, GenBank accession number AWU66525.1), which was also shown to localize to nucleoli, and the FECV UCD 3b strain used in this study. Both isolates have two overlapping pat4 motifs, with a slightly different amino acid sequence (KRRKR and KRRRR, respectively). The nucleocapsid proteins of several members of the order Nidovirales, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV, family Arteriviridae) [70, [77] [78] [79] [80] , transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [81] , mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [81, 82] and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [82] [83] [84] [85] (family Coronaviridae), also target the nucleolus and have been shown to incorporate one or more potential NLSs. Similarly, the SARS-CoV 3b protein was predicted to have two overlapping NLSs, a pat4 and bipartite motif, that were shown to be associated with nuclear (nucleolar) localization [27] .",

As shown in Fig. 6 , deletion of residues 2 to 50 (p3b-EGFP D2-15, D2-25, D2-35, D2-45 and D2-50) still resulted in EGFP translocation to the nucleoli. However, deletion of residues 2 to 55 (p3b-EGFP D2-55), which results in a deletion of the first three residues of the pat4 motifs, and deletion of residues 2 to 65 (p3b-EGFP D2-65), whereby the complete pat4 motifs are removed, was associated with a complete loss of nucleolar accumulation of the corresponding EGFP fusion protein. Similarly, deleting the 12 C-terminal residues (p3b-EGFP D61-72) did not alter nucleolar localization, but deletion of the 17 C-terminal residues (p3b-EGFP D56-72), which results in a deletion of the last 2 residues of the pat4 motifs, or deletion of the 22 C-terminal residues (p3b-EGFP D56-72), whereby both pat4 motifs are completely removed, abrogated nucleolar expression. In addition, deletion of the overlapping pat4 motifs (p3b-EGFP D53-57), also resulted in a lack of nucleolar localization. These results suggest that, even though the 3b protein is theoretically able to passively diffuse through the nuclear pore complex, translocation to Twenty-four hours after transfection with p3b-3\u00d7FLAG and p3\u00d7FLAG-3b, cell lysates were prepared and fractioned by SDS-PAGE.

As mTPs have no consensus motif, prediction is frequently based on (1) the amino acid composition of the N-terminal part of the protein, (2) the propensity to form amphipathic \u03b1-helices and (3) the presence of putative recognition motifs or MPP cleavage sites. A conserved motif \u03d5\u03c7\u03c7\u03d5\u03d5 in the N-terminal mitochondrial presequence, where \u03d5 represents hydrophobic residues (L, F, I, V, W, Y, M) and \u03c7 any residue, that is recognized by the Tom20 protein has been identified [86, 87] , with a preference for basic residues on position 3 (\u03d5\u03c7\u03b2\u03d5\u03d5, with \u03b2 representing either R, K or H) [87] . However, import into mitochondria can still be observed after substituting such hydrophobic residues with alanine, despite reduced Tom20 binding [88] . In addition, 14 hexamers, such as \u03d5\u03d5\u03c3\u03b2\u03d5\u03d5, \u03d5\u03d5\u03b2\u03c3\u03d5\u03d5 and \u03b2\u03d5\u03d5\u03c3\u03c3\u03c3 (where \u03c3 represents polar residues S, T, N or Q), have been proposed to be involved in mitochondrial targeting, but their actual function as mitochondrial targeting sequences remains to be elucidated [89] . In the absence of an N-terminal mTP, proteins can still target the mitochondria through internal targeting signals or hydrophobic domains (reviewed in [51] ). Mitochondrial targeting of the SARS-CoV 3b protein was shown to be determined by a region located in the middle of the protein rather than by N-terminal residues [26, 28] . Furthermore, the outer membrane of the mitochondria contains proteins, called porins, that will freely allow molecules smaller than 10 kDa to cross the mitochondrial membrane [46] . In addition, viral proteins can also be transported from the ER into the mitochondria via the mitochondria-associated membrane compartment (reviewed in [51, 90] ).",

Multiple sequence alignment revealed that 173 (97.19 %) and 176 (98.88 %) of a total of 178 aligned sequences respectively have a Tom20(1) and Tom20(2) recognition motif.

Five isolates (2.81 %) seemed to lack a Tom20(1) motif and two isolates (1.12 %) a Tom20(2) motif ( Table 2) . Comparison of the 3b sequence of isolate HU2009FC, which is known to locate to mitochondria [25] , and FECV UCD showed that the Tom20(1) and Tom20(2) recognition motifs were identical.

Furthermore, deletion of residues 2 to 65 (p3b-EGFP D2-65), which includes deletion of the Tom20(2) motif, no longer induced mitochondrial colocalization. It should be noted that as a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern was observed after the transfection of p3b-EGFP D2-55, in addition to mitochondrial expression, there may be an indication that mitochondrial localization of this truncated protein is reduced compared to the wild-type 3b.

At 4 h post-transfection, the fluorescent signal in the nucleoli was found to increase and a vague cytoplasmic signal was detected, but it was not until 5 h after transfection that a mitochondrial pattern was clearly visible. As of 6 h post-transfection, the fluorescent signal was brighter and an increasing number of cells began to show exclusive mitochondrial expression of the 3b protein, as exemplified in Fig. 2 . These results may indicate nucleolar-mitochondrial shuttling, as observed for the PRRSV nucleocapsid [78] . Like nuclear import, shuttling proteins from the nucleus back to the cytoplasm is established by a nuclear export signal (NES) that is recognized by exportins such as CRM1.

Mitochondrial expression is mainly triggered by N-terminal residues 10-35, which contain a putative Tom20 recognition motif and two overlapping hexamers potentially involved in mitochondrial localization. Additionally, a second Tom20 recognition motif was identified, which seems to be able to target the protein to mitochondria, although less efficiently compared to the N-terminal mTP.
