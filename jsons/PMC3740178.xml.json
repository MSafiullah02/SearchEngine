            "text": "Since solution NMR was used to determine the structure of the transmembrane (TM) domain of the glycophorin A dimer in 1997 [1], there has been steady progress in its application to membrane proteins. As illustrated by the timeline of achievements in Figure 1\n, full-scale structural characterization by solution NMR has been carried out for a variety of membrane systems, including the membrane-associated regions of surface receptors [2, 3, 4\u2022\u2022], membrane-embedded porins [5], regulatory proteins [6], ion channels [7, 8, 9], intramembrane enzymes [10, 11], the seven TM helix receptors [12\u2022\u2022], and transporters [13\u2022\u2022]. These advances have coincided with and benefitted from the enabling methods that have gradually matured in the past decade, such as relaxation-optimized spectroscopy [14], dipolar coupling measurement [15], paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) protocols [16], as well as methods for characterizing msec\u2013\u03bcsec time-scale protein dynamics [17]. In addition to solution NMR, solid-state NMR has also illustrated great potential, as represented by recent studies of the influenza proton channels [18] and the more complex G-protein coupled receptor [19]. Although detailed structure determination of membrane proteins NMR remains challenging, the versatility of the technology permits to generate a wide variety of data including structure, dynamics, and ligand interaction which are particularly useful when investigating dynamic systems such as ion channels and transporters.",

            "text": "The influenza M2 protein forms a pH-modulated proton channel that equilibrates pH across the viral membrane during viral entry and across the trans-Golgi membrane of infected cells during viral maturation [20]. The viral channel has been the subject of intense NMR research owing to its biomedical importance; it is a target of the adamantane-family antiviral drugs, but drug resistance has become a critical problem [21]. In 2008, back-to-back X-ray crystallographic and solution NMR studies independently determined the structures of the closed states (pH \u223c7.5) of the M2 channel using a peptide containing residues 24\u201346 and a longer construct containing residues 18\u201360, respectively [7, 22]. The NMR structure was determined using a combination of inter-strand nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs), backbone residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), and sidechain dihedral angles [7]. The structure shows a homo-tetrameric assembly in which left-handed packing of four equivalent TM helices forms the channel pore and four amphipathic helices constitute the C-terminal base of the channel (Figure 2a). This architecture provides a channel-like scaffold for positioning the critical HxxxW sequence element inside the pore where four imidazole rings of His37, which receive and transport protons, are about midway inside the pore and four indoles of Trp41 are packed within van der Waals (VDW) distances to form the channel gate. In addition to M2, the structure of a M2 functional homolog from influenza B (BM2) was also determined using solution NMR methods [8]. The BM2 channel, as revealed by the NMR structure, is very different from AM2 of infulenza A; its channel domain is an inverse coiled-coil tetramer in membrane that does not contain the amphipathic helices (Figure 2b). The arrangement of HxxxW inside the pore is however very similar to that of M2.",

            "text": "Establishing a relevant NMR measurement protocol of ion channels allows for investigating the dynamic aspects of these proteins. The M2 protein conducts protons in a pH-dependent manner [23]. Its slow rate of conduction (\u223c15 H+/s) [24] is consistent with its function as a transporter that binds protons from on low pH side and turn them over to the high pH side of the channel (Figure 2c) [24]. In this mechanism, the rate-limiting step (k\n3) must involve a conformational change, coupling histidine protonation to opening of the tryptophan gate. Indeed, the relaxation-compensated Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) experiment [17] showed that as the pH was lowered from 7.5 to 6.0, the conformational exchange rate of Trp41 indole increased by more than four-fold, suggesting that the gate is being \u2018unlocked\u2019 and becomes more dynamic upon channel activation [7]. The structure of the open state of M2 is not yet determined due to severe resonance broadening at low pH. Recently, NMR measurements of an AM2-BM2 chimera showed extremely high quality NMR spectra at both pH 7.5 and 6.0 [25\u2022]. This hybrid construct, which was inspired by earlier functional studies [26], contains residues of the N-terminal half of the AM2 channel, followed by residues of the C-terminal half of the BM2 channel; it has been shown to recapitulate the channel properties of the native AM2 channel [26]. We remain hopeful that this new system will eventually provide detailed structural and dynamic information of the open on conducting state of the M2 channel.",

Solution NMR study of the wild type M2 identified a rimantadine binding site external to the channel near the tryptophan gate [7]. This site was, however, subsequently proven not the primary site of amantadine inhibition observed in vivo [26]. The functional site is inside the channel as suggested by the low resolution density in the crystal structure [22] and solid-state NMR measurements [18]. Recently, the precise structure of the rimantadine binding site inside the channel has been determined by solution NMR using the AM2\u2013BM2 chimera construct mentioned above [25\u2022]. The structure shows that the adamantyl cage of the drug fits snuggly into a hydrophobic pocket inside the pore while the drug amino group is in polar contact with protein backbone oxygen. Furthermore, NMR studies showed that drug binding significantly altered the channel structure, suggesting that mutations could confer drug resistance by altering conformational equilibrium between the apo and the drug-bound states.",

In the case of a small multidrug resistant transporter EmrE, the two states were found to be related by a pseudo-twofold symmetry and NMR chemical exchange analysis helped confirm the antiparallel dimer model [42\u2022\u2022]. In a much more frequent situation of nonequivalent states, however, in addition to obtaining the structure of the transporter, it would be very important to characterize conformational differences between those states for understanding the transport mechanism. A highly tempting possibility is to use NMR to generate structural and dynamics information on membrane transporters under various conditions of substrate or inhibitor binding that would complement the atomic resolution crystal structures. It should be emphasized here that the synergy of the two approaches can greatly enhance our understanding of conformational plasticity exhibited by many other membrane proteins, including the all-important G-protein coupled receptors [43\u2022\u2022].",

But most transporters are helical proteins with much longer polypeptide chains (>300 amino acids). The long-range NOEs for helical proteins involve mostly methyl groups, and this type of NOEs are difficult to measure due primarily to two reasons. One is the poor chemical shift dispersion of the methyl resonances that precludes comprehensive assignment of methyl-methyl NOEs. The other is the higher dynamics of the methyl groups (e.g. unlocked side chain \u03c71 or \u03c72 rotamers) that significantly reduces the efficiency of NOE buildup.",

The candidate fragments were assigned to the protein sequence and this step is referred to as fragment assignment (Figure 3b). The next procedure was building longer structured segments based on the assigned 7-residue stretches using two operations: end extension and gap filling. End extension is extending the N-terminal or C-terminal ends of a structurally assigned segment along the protein sequence by searching for unused candidate fragments that overlap with the segment in backbone dihedral angles, and that provide the best Q\nfree for the final extended segment. Similarly, Gap filling is to fill gap regions (<4 residues) between two structurally assigned segments by searching for fragments that overlap in backbone dihedral angles with the two flanking segment and that provide good Q\nfree for the merged segment.",
