Studies have shown that RV infection in children is associated with increased detection of pathogenic bacteria in the airways.5, 6 Furthermore, detection of RV together with specific airway pathogens (eg, Moraxella catarrhalis) is associated with increased ARI and asthma symptoms.6 Recently, RV-A and RV-C were reported to differentially associate with detection of pathogenic bacteria in school-age children.7 However, no study has investigated the relationships between rhinovirus species and airway microbiota in infants, let alone infants with bronchiolitis. To address the knowledge gap, we examined the association between rhinovirus species and the nasopharyngeal airway microbiota determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing in 774 infants with severe bronchiolitis.",

The details of the study design, setting, virus and microbiota measurements, and analysis are described in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org. Briefly, 1016 infants (age <1 year) hospitalized for bronchiolitis were enrolled in 17 sites across 14 US states (see Table E1 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). Bronchiolitis was defined according to the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines. The institutional review boards at participating sites approved the study. Informed consent was obtained from the infants' parent or legal guardian. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected within 24 hours of hospitalization and stored at \u221280\u00b0C locally. These samples were processed and tested for 17 respiratory pathogens by real-time PCR and for microbiota using 16S rRNA gene sequencing at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, Tex). Singleplex real-time PCR was used to detect RV, and positive specimens were further genotyped by using molecular typing assay at the University of Wisconsin (Madison, Wis). By using partitioning around medoids unsupervised clustering with the use of weighted UniFrac distance, 4 distinct nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles were derived as previously described.8 In the current analysis, we grouped infants into 4 mutually exclusive virus categories: solo RSV (reference), RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C. We tested the association between these virus categories and nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles by constructing multinomial logistic regression model adjusting for 8 covariates. Data were analyzed using R version 3.4.4.",

A, Between the 4 virus categories, the proportion of nasopharyngeal microbiota profiles differed. For example, compared with infants with RSV-only bronchiolitis, those with RV-A infection were more likely to have a Haemophilus-dominant, mixed, or Moraxella-dominant profile than a Streptococcus-dominant profile. Infants with RV-C infection were more likely to have a Moraxella-dominant profile. P values were derived from adjusted multinomial logistic regression model. Corresponding relative rate ratios are presented in Table I. *P < .05. B, Between the 4 virus categories, the distribution of relative abundance of 3 most common genera in the nasopharyngeal microbiota differed. Data are presented using violin plots, which are boxplots with a rotated kernel density plot on each side. P values adjusted for multiple comparisons are presented in Table E3.",
