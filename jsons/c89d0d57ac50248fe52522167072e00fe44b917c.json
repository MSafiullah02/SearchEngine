Immune EM, which increases sensitivity and allows virus characterization when type-specific antibodies are used, has also been used for the detection of enteric viruses. Serological methods have been developed for the detection of some of these viruses. Enzyme immunosorbent assays (EIA) and passive particle agglutination tests (PPAT), some of which are available commercially, provide sensitivity comparable to, or better than, EM for the detection of RVs, NVs, ASVs, and ADVs.

These methods provide improved sensitivity for the detection of all enteric viruses, but have had a major impact on the detection of human caliciviruses (Table 3) . Viruses do not replicate in food or water, and the concentration of virus particles in contaminated products is likely to be very small and not distributed homogeneously throughout the foodstuff.
