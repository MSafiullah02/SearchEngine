Malignancy as a cause is also more common in children with chronic generalized lymphadenopathy, nodes greater than 3 cm in diameter, and nodes in the supraclavicular region. Associated symptoms of night sweats, weight loss, and hepatosplenomegaly also increase the chance of malignancy. Finally abnormal laboratory and radiologic evaluation are associated with increased malignancy rates.7 Soldes and colleagues reviewed predictors of malignancy in children with peripheral lymphadenopathy and determined that increasing node size, increasing number of sites of adenopathy, and age were associated with an increasing risk of malignancy (P < 0.05).8 In addition, supraclavicular adenopathy, an abnormal chest radiograph, and fixed nodes were all significantly associated with malignancy.",

The cure rates were 92%, 10%, 86%, and 41%, respectively.38 Incision and drainage should be avoided, because it often results in a chronically draining sinus. There have been reports of adequate medical treatment of atypical mycobacterial lymphadenitis; however, in a recent multicenter randomized trial comparing surgical excision and antibiotics, surgical excision was superior, with a 96% cure rate compared with 66% with antibiotic therapy.39 Multidrug antibiotic therapy, usually including clarithromycin and rifabutin, may be used as an adjunct for unresectable or recurrent disease.40 Surgical treatment should include elliptic excision of the overlying skin when it is thinned out, debridement of subcutaneous granulation tissue, and complete excision of the involved node(s) with closure of the overlying skin; formal lymph node dissection is not required. Curettage is recommended only if surgical excision is not possible because of unacceptable cosmetic outcomes or risk of injuries to adjacent nerves.

The World Health Organization recommends directly observed short-course therapy, including isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for the first 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for an additional 4 months.46 Nodal regression usually occurs within 3 months. Although antituberculous chemotherapy remains essential, the role of complete surgical excision of involved nodes is more controversial.47 Complete excision of involved nodes is prudent when biopsy is required for diagnosis, when a chronically draining sinus tract evolves during medical treatment, or when optimal medical management fails.",

Subsequent adenitis occurs at regional lymphatic drainage basins (inguinal, axillary, epitrochlear nodes) 5 days to 2 months later.50 Similarly, cervical lymphadenopathy is observed with scratches in the head and neck region. Although the primary manifestation of Bartonella henselae infection is lymphadenopathy, some series report up to 25% of cases resulting in severe systemic illnesses.51\n",
