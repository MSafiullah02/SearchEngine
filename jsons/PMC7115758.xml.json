This is not because these patients are particularly difficult to intubate, but because the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines6 stipulate that the most experienced operator should secure the airway in order to minimise delay and secretion dissemination. At such times, tracheal intubation is often necessary and, although other airway devices such as the laryngeal mask may facilitate some temporary ventilation and oxygenation, a properly sealed tracheal tube is often mandatory in the care of these patients.",

Apart from the anatomical differences between manikins and patients, there is the failure of manikins to respond physiologically to tracheal intubation. The study took place in controlled conditions without the extra stress created by performing life-saving procedures on patients with respiratory failure. In addition the possibility of the participants contracting the respiratory illness during the procedure could not be simulated. All intubations were of the same grading and further work needs to be performed focusing on more difficult airway management.",

We found that, although none of the types of PPE had a measurable effect on intubation times, the practical problems of excessive heating and fogging while wearing a transparent face shield device may be problematic during tracheal intubation of patients with respiratory distress. There were also difficulties in viewing the fibreoptic bronchoscopic eyepiece through the face shields of PPE 1 and PPE 2. The study showed that using bronchoscopic methods was inferior to iLMA, which allowed significantly earlier ventilation of the lungs. This suggests that the iLMA should be used in preference to the fibreoptic bronchoscope when difficulties in viewing the larynx are experienced during direct laryngoscopy.",
