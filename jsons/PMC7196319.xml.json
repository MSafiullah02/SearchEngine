Due to this increasing demand for energy and burning of more fossil fuels, global warming has become one of the greatest consequential dilemmas facing the human being with considerable social, environmental and economic outcomes. There are three outstanding ethical dilemmas, making difficult the climate change discussions: how to settle the rights and obligation of the developed and developing countries; how to estimate Geo-engineering schemes planned to slow or reverse climate change; and how to test our obligation to next generations who must struggle with an inferior climate we are changing today. In recent years, public awareness, the number of communities, national and international meetings about global warming have raised around the world. As prominent examples of international meetings, we can mention the Paris Agreement [2] and the Kyoto Protocol [3] as the two most important conventions by the United Nations on climate change.",

These policies can be listed as follows:\u2756Feed-in tariff (FIT) policy is an energy-supply policy concentrated on supporting the progress of renewable energy plans by proposing long period purchase arrangements for the sale of renewable energy electricity. These arrangements propose purchasing every kilowatt-hour electricity for 10\u201325 years. The proposed payment levels for each kilowatt-hour can be distinguished by various factors such as project size, resource quality, technology type, and project location to properly cover main project costs. Policymakers can also arrange the payment levels to decrease for installations in the following years, which will both follow and encourage changes in technology. The two most ordinary FIT policies are the fixed FIT and the feed-in premium. In the fixed FIT, which is the most widely used FIT design, payment quantity stays independent of the market price for electricity, proposing a guaranteed payment for a clearly described period. In the feed-in premium, which is being increasingly used, the payment quantity is based on a premium proposed above the market price for electricity and this premium can either vary, dependent upon a sliding scale, or it can be constant.\n",

            "text": "Several countries, especially in Europe and Asia, have shifted away from FIT policies to auction and tender policies to support large-scale renewable energy project deployment. In spite of the fact that support for large-scale renewable energy projects is changing to a different mechanism in a growing number of countries, but FIT policies continue to be valid in many countries for the deployment of small-scale renewable energy installations. Policy designers continue to change FIT rates as the technologies become more cost-competitive in each country.\u2756Auctions and tenders are the most rapidly extending scheme of supporting mechanism for deployment of renewable energy projects and are becoming the preferred policy for supporting large-scale projects. Generally, they are on the basis of the cost of electricity generation; although in auctions, the price is the only factor to be considered, tenders may contain extra criteria.\u2756Net metering is a metering and billing agreement designed to compensate small-scale system owners for any electricity production that is exported to the grid. Net metering allows utility customers with on-site distributed energy generation to offset the electricity they extract from the utility grid during the billing cycle (e.g., one month) and they pay for the net electricity consumed from the grid. Net metering customers directly utilize the electricity produced on-site by their generation systems. If the amount of generation exceeds the utilized electricity, the excess electricity is exported to the utility grid. If a customer utilizes more electricity than distributed energy generation system produces, he or she imports electricity from the utility grid and pays the full retail rate for that amount of electricity, exactly similar to a traditional utility customer.\u2756Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) policy is a regulatory mandate to raise energy generation from renewable resources and it's also called a renewable electricity standard. The RPS procedure usually places an obligation on power supply companies to generate a clearly described fraction of their power production from renewable energy resources.\u2756Besides these main policies, some countries provided public funds by grants, loans or tax incentives to guide investment in renewable energy development. However, most of these incentives have been decreased or canceled in recent years in reaction to tightening fiscal budgets and/or reducing technology costs.\n",

During recent years, it has embarked several policies for production and consumption of energy. Four remarkable policies that have affected energy demand, can be mentioned as:I.The first and the most prominent energy policy in Iran is the large energy consumption subsidization, particularly in households and transport sectors. There are several distinctive approximations for energy subsidies in Iran (between 0.5 and 12% of GDP); However, it is accepted that Iran's energy subsidies are one of the top-ranking energy subsidies in the world.II.The second policy is assigning of oil production capacity in accord with the OPEC endorsements. Meanwhile, faced with capital restrictions, Iran identified the important role of international investment in the oil sector to develop new fields and improve the recovery factor in the existent fields, hence presented a \u201cbuy-back\u201d contract to international investors. This contract permitted international companies to finance in oil and gas fields in Iran and to share profits with the domestic counterparts.III.The third prominent energy policy in Iran has been the noticeable consumption and progression of natural gas fields from the 1990s so far. This policy reinforced, especially when Iran discovered its share of the South Pars gas field, the world largest gas reservoir, which is located in the Persian Gulf. Iran has been using most of its ever-growing gas production to replace relatively cheap and environmentally friendly natural gas for domestic consumption of crude oil products in various sectors. In 2018, its energy consumption based on natural gas was 193.9 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) [1].IV.The fourth important energy policy in Iran is providing rural areas with electricity by new transmission lines. This policy has assisted a lot of rural communities to receive clean and cheap energy and decrease environmental problems like for example deforestation.\n",

These organizations have conducted several projects on the wind, solar, and geothermal energy resources in Iran.\u2713National Iranian Oil Company established IFCO (Iranian Fuel Conservation Company) in 2000 with the aim to regulate fuel consumption in various sectors. IFCO has audited several manufacturing industries and recommended different procedures for energy conservation in those units. Substituting pollutant and inefficient old taxis with new autos in cities and using compressed natural gas (CNG) as a replacement for gasoline are samples of the plans by IFCO in recent years.\u2713Iran has tried to improve consumption of nuclear energy by finishing the Bushehr nuclear plant (which started in the 1970s and become operational in 2013) and investing in other new plants. In 2018, its energy consumption based on nuclear energy was 1.6 Mtoe [1].\u2713Although high-impact low-probability (HILP) events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and consequent flooding have prominent influence on power generation companies [17] and the number of these natural disasters has increased in recent years in Iran, but there is not a comprehensive and clear policy for these situations. Generally government decides based on the event impact on local people life and, for example, provide them with free fuel and power for a certain period of time. As another example for emergency situation, during COVID-19 crisis in Iran the authorities have postponed the payments due for water and power bills in the country.\n",

            "text": "Similar to other countries in the world, there has been a growing trend toward the utilization of sustainable energies in Iran, too. Besides enormous fossil fuel reserves, Iran enjoys a perfect potential of using renewable energies (energy resources that are naturally inexhaustible and replenished) such as solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and hydropower. In Iran, electrical customers participate in an electricity market and buy electricity generated from fossil fuels. Due to the current Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) prices, production of electric power based on renewable energy resources is not economical on its own yet. Therefore, the progression of the renewable energy division in Iran is leaned upon the government incentive attitude and its encouraging policy on this subject. From the environmental aspects, noticeable troubles in Iran are CO2 emissions and air pollution. In 2018, CO2 emissions in Iran were 656.4 million tonnes, increased by 5.5% growth rate per annum that is above double its 10-year average of 2.6% from 2007 to 2017 [1]. So recently, the authorities have paid basic investment in harnessing renewable energies and laid down the new supporting policies to inspire people to use clean energy resources. Due to the huge investments in hydropower, a large share of renewable power generation in Iran is hydroelectricity, around 2.4 Mtoe in 2018 [1]. Although in recent times, it has been financing on others, such as wind and solar power, too.",

As mentioned above, new supporting policies such as different feed-in tariff and subsidies have been described to stimulate using of renewable energies and turn them to competitive technologies with common electricity production methods based on the burning of fossil fuels. According to the new supporting policy of the government, the latest prices for electricity based on the feed-in tariff by offering long-term contracts to renewable energy resources are shown in Table 1\n[24]. The selected currency in this study is the Iranian Rial (IRR) which can be converted to US Dollar (USD) easily (1 USD \u2248 42,000 IRR). According to Table 1, the government will buy electricity from the producers at two prices: during the first 10 years, the purchasing price is relatively high to investors gain their investment as soon as possible. However, during the second 10 years, the price will be decreased to 70% of the prime bid for all resources except the wind systems (the price will be calculated according to their capacity factors), and after 20 years the electricity can be sold in energy exchange. So, investments in different renewable and clean energy resources (especially PV technology) with different scales, are fostered by the new feed-in tariff to decrease consumption of fossil fuels in Iran.",

According to this figure the estimated initial costs for 1 MW PV power plant is 50 bIRR and after starting operation, the obtained annual interest income is above 1 bIRR so the payback period for the initial investment is about 5 years. The change in linear trend of this plot is related to the estimated periodic costs (10.75 bIRR) for replacing invertors and other necessary services after 12 years. Following this payment, the same annual interest income can be gained till 20 years. The average annual interest rate for this investment is about 3% over 20 years, base on the new feed-in tariff for this scale of PV power plant.",

From the economic outlook, there isn't a linear relation in cumulative cash flows rate and the average annual interest rate with the scale of the PV power plant.

Therefore, residential and commercial customers will have considerable long-term benefits, from taking part in an electricity market and selling their PV systems output. While those PV systems generally do not need a technician to be on-site for daily direct management due to its automated operation, and they just need insignificant and slight oversight, monitoring, and maintenance. On the other hand, the government itself has taken responsibility to set up large-scale PV power plants around the country. By focusing on these two procedures in PV subject, Iran takes its first steps in lessening reliance on fossil fuels consumption and its related environmental issues. In future research, we will examine the various feasible renewable energy projects in Iran, for different scales from the environmental and economic aspects in terms of this new feed-in tariff for each technology categories and scales.
