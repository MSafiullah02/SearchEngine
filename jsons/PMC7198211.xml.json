By Feb 26, 2020, there were only 102 ventilators across all 23 states and the capital district; half of these were located in hospitals in the capital Caracas, and the other half were unevenly distributed across the rest of the country.5 It is clear that the demand for beds and ventilators in hospitals across Venezuela will quickly exceed capacity for patients with COVID-19. Tragically, the decline of the industrial and construction sectors and the depletion of resources will affect Venezuela's ability to undertake temporary construction or increase hospital capacities.",
