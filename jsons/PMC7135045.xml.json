In the study by Lee and colleagues,1 use of steroids may account for the decreasing trend in lymphocyte count over the 7 days of treatment. Booth and colleagues2 only used steroids in 40% of the patients, less than half of whom received them during the first 48 h. Therefore, some of the lymphopenia reported by Booth and colleagues2 may be associated with use of steroids, but it does not account for all the patients, and certainly not for the lymphopenia at the initial presentation.",

Therefore, is the lymphopenia seen in some of the SARS patients an indication of the integrity of the status of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis? More importantly, are the patients without lymphopenia, adrenal insufficient?",
