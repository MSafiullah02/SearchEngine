In the immunocompromised individual, therapeutic modalities are diverse and are frequently indicated to either prevent or treat the lymphoproliferative complications and risk for malignancy from EBV. Both acyclovir and ganciclovir have in vitro activity against lytic replication of EBV, with ganciclovir having slightly greater efficacy [97] . However, there are few data to suggest that antivirals have a significant effect on the outcome of infection. EBV-related lymphoproliferative disorders and malignancies in immunocompromised hosts are thought to be dependent on latent infection that relies on cellular enzymes for EBV episomal DNA synthesis, and thus are not inhibited by the routine anti-herpesvirus nucleoside analogues [96] . Both acyclovir and ganciclovir have been used for prophylaxis in patients after solid organ transplantation, with meta-analyses suggesting a benefit to universal prophylaxis against CMV in preventing PTLD [98] . However, no firm conclusions can be drawn because of the small size and heterogeneity of the patient populations and non-randomized nature of these studies. Induction of the EBV thymidine kinase gene through the use of compounds such as arginine butyrate has been attempted in order to induce susceptibility to antiviral therapy with a mixed degree of success [99, 100] . Another antiviral that has been investigated in in vitro assays and in case reports is high-dose zidovudine (AZT) [101] .

The use of antiviral therapy in established disease may be used to reduce active viral replication and resultant immunosuppression but does not appear to directly impact tumor progression. In solid organ transplant recipients, CMV is a co-factor for PTLD, and prevention or treatment of CMV may be of benefit. The use of rituximab as a preemptive approach in HSCT to prevent PTLD in patients with otherwise asymptomatic but persistent EBV viremia has not always yielded persistent control in many patients [104] .

Because excretion of enteroviruses from the gastrointestinal tract can persist after infection for as long as 8 weeks, [198, 199] isolation of the virus from stool, rectal swabs or possibly the oropharynx may result in a falsely positive assay. The same holds true for PCR when used in samples taken from these anatomic locations. Most experiences with PCR comes from CSF samples in cases of suspected aseptic meningitis where the sensitivity may be higher than culture and much more clinically useful [200] . There is no established treatment for enteroviruses [196] . Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been used with mixed success in various case reports of patients with persistent meningitis and in children with myocarditis when compared to historical controls [188, 189, 201] . Antibody responses to enterovirus are serotype-specific, and because of this, IVIG may not be clinically useful in all cases [202] . There are no data regarding dosing and duration of use with IVIG. Previous investigations of specific antiviral therapy against enteroviruses resulted in the development of a compound known as pleconaril. Pleconaril acted by binding to the viral capsid antigen, impairing viral binding and uncoating [203] . Clinical trials and various case reports of pleconaril use in aseptic meningitis have shown only modest to no clinical benefit, and its further development was put on hold [189, 204] . Control of polio via vaccination has virtually eliminated wild polio viral infections in the Western hemisphere. Loss of immunity to poliovirus is well-documented in patients after allogeneic HSCT [205, 206] , and has led to recommendations for revaccination with inactivated poliovirus vaccine after transplantation [207] . Live virus, vaccines should be avoided in immunosuppressed patients, and the live attenuated oral poliovirus vaccine is no longer available in the United States due to the rare but severe complication of vaccine-associated paralytic polio. Since the implementation of the inactivated vaccine, vaccine-associated paralytic polio has been eliminated in the United States [208] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 737, "end": 742, "text": "[197]", "ref_id": "BIBREF196"}, {"start": 864, "end": 869, "text": "[198,", "ref_id": "BIBREF197"}, {"start": 870, "end": 874, "text": "199]", "ref_id": "BIBREF198"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1252, "text": "[200]", "ref_id": "BIBREF199"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1312, "text": "[196]", "ref_id": "BIBREF195"}, {"start": 1515, "end": 1520, "text": "[188,", "ref_id": "BIBREF187"}, {"start": 1521, "end": 1525, "text": "189,", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1530, "text": "201]", "ref_id": "BIBREF200"}, {"start": 1658, "end": 1663, "text": "[202]", "ref_id": "BIBREF201"}, {"start": 1966, "end": 1971, "text": "[203]", "ref_id": "BIBREF202"}, {"start": 2146, "end": 2151, "text": "[189,", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}, {"start": 2152, "end": 2156, "text": "204]", "ref_id": "BIBREF203"}, {"start": 2356, "end": 2361, "text": "[205,", "ref_id": "BIBREF204"}, {"start": 2362, "end": 2366, "text": "206]", "ref_id": "BIBREF205"}, {"start": 2476, "end": 2481, "text": "[207]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2853, "end": 2858, "text": "[208]", "ref_id": "BIBREF206"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 82, "end": 94, "text": "(Table 2-21)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Diagnosis"}, {"text": "Viral hepatitis A, B and C are unrelated viruses capable of inducing acute or both acute and chronic liver disease.

The differential diagnosis includes numerous infectious and non-infectious etiologies, including other viruses such as CMV, EBV, HSV, VZV, and the other hepatitides. The diagnosis is usually made via the measurement of serum anti-hepatitis A IgM antibodies, in the right clinical setting. These antibodies can usually be detected by 1 week into the illness and persist in immunocompetent individuals for several months. Detection of viral RNA via PCR is only available only in the research setting. Treatment is supportive with no available antiviral therapy.

BK viruria is uncommon in general and tends to be lower in quantity than in HSCT recipients with hemorrhagic cystitis [271, 272] . HSCT patients with hemorrhagic cystitis have high level viruria (100,000,000-10,000,000,000 copies/mL), and levels of 10,000,000 copies/ mL correlate with risk for hemorrhagic cystitis in this patient population [271] . The pattern of BK viruria is also thought to be of potential significance. In one prospective cohort, some patients who went on to develop hemorrhagic cystitis invariably experienced a peaking of their BK viruria as measured by PCR in the 2-3 week period after HSCT, and before clinical hemorrhagic cystitis [273] . Measurement of plasma with PCR for the presence of BK virus may also show a correlation with the development of hemorrhagic cystitis.
