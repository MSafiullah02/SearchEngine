The complexities of infection control in hospitals have challenged medical systems and are constantly evolving with advances in medical technology and the care of increasingly vulnerable patients. Environmental and climate conditions create infection control challenges unique to the tropics. Tropical climates are warm and humid, with environmental pollution (urbanization, industrial wastes, and air pollution) leading to higher vector densities and communicable disease outbreaks. Furthermore, the tropics roughly coincide with low-development-index countries, adding resource constraints. The term nosocomial infection has referred to hospital-acquired infections among patients presenting 72 hours after hospitalization. We prefer the term health care\u2013associated infections (HAIs) because many infections associated with delivering health care occur in outpatient settings, and hospital-acquired infections can present sooner than 72 hours after admission.",

Guidelines published by the HICPAC/SHEA/APIC/IDSA Hand Hygiene Task Force provide specific recommendations.3 Alcohol-based hand rubs can be used where there is limited access to water. They have better acceptability, less skin irritation, and quicker application compared with soap and water, resulting in improved compliance. Commercially prepared products are available, but a low-cost gel can be prepared by hospital pharmacies using 20 mL of glycerin, propylene glycol, or sorbitol mixed with 980 mL of >70% isopropanol. Gels combining chlorhexidine and alcohol may be more effective than alcohol alone because of chlorhexidine's prolonged bactericidal effect, but are expensive. They should be limited to situations when a high degree of hand antisepsis is necessary, such as before surgical procedures and placing invasive devices.",

High rates of gram-negative HAIs have been documented in neonatal nurseries in low-income countries with rates threefold to twentyfold higher than in developed regions.7, 8 HAIs are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality, are a waste of precious resources, and subvert patient expectations of quality medical care. This increases negativity toward the health care system, especially because patients bear the costs of HAIs in many developing countries. Reducing the risk of HAIs in developing countries is a priority of the WHO.9\n",

In developing countries there are multiple additional contributors (Table 20.3\n). These include lack of surveillance to control infections and outbreaks, inappropriate antibiotic use, non-adherence to infection control practices, inadequate sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of single-use devices, and reservoirs of infection in places such as contaminated food and water in the hospital. Staff training, adequately sterilizing equipment, and improving compliance with hand hygiene are easier to address than are overcrowding and understaffing.",

Nosocomial transmission can occur directly from the patient, when transferring the dead body, through contact with infectious fluids, contaminated equipment, or needle stick injuries. Standard precautions combined with strict contact precautions and single-room isolation, especially for acutely bleeding patients or in those with profuse diarrhea or vomiting, are recommended until discharge to prevent nosocomial transmission.15 Patients can be cohorted in a designated area; failing that, they can be housed in a portion of a larger ward, in an uncrowded corner of a large hall, in rooms designated for airborne isolation, or in private rooms. In the Ebola virus outbreak of 2014, treatment centers were created for assessing, observing, and treating patients suspected of having Ebola. Health care workers should be specifically trained in caring for these patients and other personnel restricted. Personal protective equipment (PPE) should include a scrub suit, gloves, and waterproof boots (if the floor is soiled), over which a disposable gown, plastic apron, thick gloves, fluid-resistant particulate respirator (FFP2- or EN-certified equivalent or U.S. NIOSH-certified N95), and protective goggles or face shield should be worn. If this level of protection is not available, alternatives are old shirts for scrubs, washable cotton gowns for disposable gowns, plastic bags for boots, plastic sheets or plastic cloth for aprons, commercially available eyeglasses for eye protection, and plastic bottles modified for sharps disposal. In regions prone to VHF outbreaks, a VHF coordinator should be appointed to oversee preparations and response and to coordinate activity and mobilize communities for rapid control.16\n",

            "text": "Infection control can be achieved if strong institutional commitment exists. Despite the challenges, studies reviewing the cost-effectiveness of even minimal infection control measures are universally optimistic. These measures lower the costs incurred from HAIs due to longer hospital stays, greater disease morbidity and mortality, and antimicrobial agent use. The effectiveness of infection control measures can be used to indicate the quality of hospital care.41 Any intervention program should comprise a holistic approach that includes basic infection control measures. The most effective solutions will be those that are indigenously developed and implemented and improved through active learning cycles and feedback. Local research is necessary to identify critical points in infection transmission and solutions to address these.",
