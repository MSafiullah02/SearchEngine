            "text": "Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) is a chronic, progressive wasting disease of the kidneys, endemic in certain rural regions of the Balkan nations Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Romania. It is irreversible and ultimately fatal. Though this disease was first described in the 1950s, its causes have been a mystery and a source of much academic and clinical contention. Possible etiologic agents that have been explored include exposure to metals and metalloids, viruses and bacteria, and the dietary toxins aristolochic acid (AA) and ochratoxin A (OTA). AA is a toxin produced by weeds of the genus Aristolochia, common in Balkan wheat fields. Aristolochia seeds may intermingle with harvested grains and thus inadvertently enter human diets. OTA is a mycotoxin (fungal toxin) common in many foods, including cereal grains. In this study, we analyzed the weight of evidence for each of the suspected causes of BEN using the Bradford Hill criteria (BHC): nine conditions that determine weight of evidence for a causal relationship between an agent and a disease. Each agent postulated to cause BEN was evaluated using the nine criteria, and for each criterion was given a rating based on the strength of the association between exposure to the substance and BEN. From the overall available scientific evidence for each of these suspected risk factors, AA is the agent with the greatest weight of evidence in causing BEN. We describe other methods for testing causality from epidemiological studies, which support this conclusion of AA causing BEN.",

Within an endemic area in the Balkans, villages only a few kilometers apart may have very different patterns of risk, with some villages unaffected and others with high disease prevalence. (8) The disease has been found at different elevations in different nations: about 100 m in Croatia, 130 m in Bosnia, 200 m in Serbia, and 200-300 m in Romania. (8, 9) A frequent history of flooding is common in all BEN-endemic areas except Bulgaria, which has endemic areas located on well-drained land. (8) The estimated prevalence of BEN has varied over time, and may depend on the criteria used to diagnose the disease. Studies place BEN prevalence estimates at 0.5-4.4% in endemic areas across the Balkans in general, and suggest the incidence may be decreasing with time. (10) On the other hand, in the Kolubara River region in Serbia, BEN prevalence was observed to increase from 6.4% in 1971 to 8.9% in 2002. (11, 12) Current estimates of BEN prevalence in Croatia ranged from 0.3-2.3% with a mean of 1%. (13) ",

Previously, the average life expectancy of about 50 years in rural Balkan communities meant that individuals who might have developed BEN would likely have died earlier of other causes. (6) Hence, the etiologic agent for BEN may have been present in endemic areas well before WWII. Within the last 50 years, the cause of BEN has been much debated with a wide range of hypotheses. Some villagers in endemic areas still wear pendants and perform ritual ceremonies to be spared from the disease. (6) Poor epidemiologic data from many endemic areas, lost data due to social and political upheavals, and the relatively limited knowledge of nephropathies in the past have made research on finding the cause of BEN difficult in general. (6) Multiple risk factors have been suggested as etiologic agents of BEN, including plant toxins, fungal toxins, toxin exposures resulting from hydrogeochemical factors, genetics, bacteria, viruses, metals and metalloids, (14) selenium deficiency, (15, 16) and Xray emitting compounds. (6, 8, 17) Long and Voice (18) had previously examined the role of environmental exposures in the mystery of BEN using an exposure analysis model. Since then, more evidence has emerged either supporting or refuting the role of exposures to key suspected risk factors.",

(21) Apostolov and Spasic (22) suggested that coronaviruses could be transmitted to humans from pigs as a possible cause of BEN. Antibodies for the papilloma viruses BK and SV40 were analyzed in both BEN patients and healthy controls. (23) Results indicated the presence of antibodies for the BK virus in the endemic area; however, antibodies were also frequently found in the healthy population. Shindarov et al. (24) failed to establish the presence of viruses in cultures prepared from kidneys of fatal BEN cases. Another viral explanation by Radovanovic (25) speculates on the post-WWII use of DDT in the Balkans and its relation to the cat population. As DDT use increased, the cat population decreased, causing an increase in rodents that could have vectored viruses potentially involved in causing BEN. However, the presence or absence of viruses, both specifically and generally, have not been found to be significantly different in BEN-endemic versus non-BEN-endemic populations. Some bacteria such as Escherichia coli have been suggested as a cause of BEN due to a similar nephropathy induced in exposed laboratory animals. (26) In humans, however, no bacteria was found in most BEN patients' urine samples. (27) The body of evidence is inconclusive about the role of viruses and bacteria in BEN etiology. (28) ",

Groundwater used for drinking water is thought to contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and aromatic amines from the low-rank coals. Although the PAH concentrations may be low, long-term exposure and bioaccumulation in body tissue may lead to adverse health effects, including symptoms of BEN. (6, 17) Analyses by Feder et al. (29) indicated the presence of PAH and aromatic amines in groundwater samples from endemic villages. Goldberg et al. (30) reported that water samples from BEN households in endemic areas had excitation-emission matrix spectra not found in samples from nonendemic villages. Two water samples from endemic areas and one from a nonendemic area in Serbia showed high concentrations of naphthalene, fluorine, phenanthrene, and pyrene. (31) This study was followed by the findings that levels of aliphatic and aromatic compounds were higher in water samples in BEN-endemic areas than in those from nonendemic areas in Romania. (32) In contrast, a more recent study (33) found no detectable levels of any of the 16 priority pollutants designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including these chemicals in water samples throughout the Balkans, and no difference in waterborne concentrations of these pollutants between BENendemic and nonendemic villages.",

From an epidemio-logical standpoint, however, there are many factors that make the genetic explanation unlikely. These include similar disease prevalence across different ethnic backgrounds living in the Balkans; disease occurrence in immigrants to BEN-endemic areas; lower rates or absence of the disease among people who left the BEN-endemic area; and decreasing incidence in some traditional focal areas for the disease, although the same family lines (i.e., genetically related individuals) continue to live in those areas.

It is produced by several different fungi, including Aspergillus ochraceus, Aspergillus carbonarius, Aspergillus niger, and Penicillium verrucosum, (37) under conditions in which food is improperly stored (excessive moisture and temperature). Based on the similarity between the histopathology of BEN and OTA-induced porcine nephropathy, it was hypothesized that OTA might be involved in the etiology of BEN. (38) The kidney is the main target organ for OTA. OTA is a potent renal carcinogen (39, 40) and is also hepatotoxic, teratogenic and immunotoxic in several animal species. (41) (42) (43) (44) While OTA's carcinogenic mechanism is unknown, Pfohl-Leszkowicz et al. (45) hypothesize that two possible mechanisms may exist: covalent DNA adduction of OTA and oxidative stress-related DNA damage. More recently, Mally (46) described a carcinogenic mechanism based on OTAmediated disruption of mitosis leading to genetic instability and increased proliferative drive.",

Food surveys in Bulgaria in the 1980s and 1990s found that staple foods contained more OTA in BEN-endemic than nonendemic areas, as well as occasional high levels of OTA (>2 ng/mL) in serum samples from affected families. (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) Many other previous epidemiologic studies conducted in multiple countries throughout Europe and Northern Africa (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) (59) (60) (61) (62) (63) have correlated higher serum OTA levels in patients with kidney and urinary disorders, compared to healthy controls. (64) However, serum OTA has not been validated as a biomarker of OTA exposure. (65) While it appears there is suggestive evidence pointing to OTA as an etiologic factor in BEN, Grollman et al. (5, 66) and others provide several arguments against OTA's involvement in this disease. OTA has been detected in human blood and serum samples throughout Europe while BEN is only limited to villages in endemic Balkan regions, and chemically characterized OTA-DNA adducts do not form under physiologic conditions in rodents or cultured cells treated with high levels of OTA. (46, 67) A recent systematic review of epidemiological studies on OTA found no evidence of an association with BEN. Nephritic syndrome was the only health effect significantly associated with OTA exposure. (68) ",

For thousands of years, Aristolochia plants have been used for medicinal purposes, particularly for women in childbirth as a means by which to hasten labor and delivery. Nearly 200 years ago, the toxicity of certain Aristolochia species was elucidated in humans and various animal species. (69) However, it is still an ingredient in certain Chinese herbal medicines consumed worldwide. In the early 1990s, about 1,800 Belgian women who consumed weight loss supplements developed rapidly progressive renal interstitial fibrosis leading to chronic renal failure. (70) Associated with these cases was the ingestion of Aristolochia fangchi, an ingredient in herbal medicines used as part of the weight-loss program. Of those who ingested the herbal supplement, 5% developed end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This combination of health effects was first named Chinese herbs nephropathy (CHN). Based on the finding of aristolactam DNA adducts (AL-DNA) in the renal tissues of diseased patients, (71) along with animal studies showing carcinogenic effects of AA on rabbits, (72) CHN was renamed aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN).",

One possible exposure route in these Balkan populations, which do not typically use Chinese herbal medicines, is that Aristolochia weeds growing in grain fields disperse seeds containing AA that commingle with the grains. (73) Hence, the postulated human route of exposure is inadvertent ingestion of AA-contaminated grain-based products such as bread. (5) After AA is consumed and metabolically activated, it reacts with DNA to form DNA adducts. It has been proposed the mutagenic AL-DNA adducts initiate A:T\u2192T:A transversions in the p53 tumor suppressor gene. (5) ",

Various environmental conditions in these settings may enhance or reduce the presence of certain risk factors. As succinctly described in Long and Voice, (18) more flooded areas with poor soil conditions and less cultivation had been associated with greater abundance of Aristolochia clematitis. Additionally, growers' methods of harvesting, threshing, and bundling the grains, which could commingle Aristolochia with cereal grains, would increase the likelihood that plant tissues containing AA could contaminate the food supply. Of course, some of these conditions, such as flooding, could also increase the likelihood that OTA would develop in grains. Finally, there is the possibility that multiple risk factors work together to increase BEN risk.",

The BHC, or Hill's Criteria for Causation, were described in 1965 as a set of conditions that provide a general guideline to determine evidence of a relationship between a suspected agent and a disease, from an observed association to the verdict of causation. (74) A brief summary of the nine criteria, defined by Sir Bradford Hill, which we use to evaluate the weight of evidence for each possible risk factor of BEN, are outlined in Table I . Our analysis is similar to those carried out by Rhomberg et al. (75) and Perrio et al. (76) Each suspected cause was evaluated on the following nine criteria. First, strength of association between each suspected risk factor and the disease BEN was evaluated where possible. A strong association is more likely to have a causal component than is a modest association. Second, the consistency of the relationship was determined. A relationship between an agent and a disease that is observed repeatedly over time, and replicated in different studies by different investigative teams, is more likely to indicate a causal association. Third, specificity was evaluated based on the criterion that the association is limited to specific populations and to a particular disease. Ideally, there is no association between the agent and other diseases, although Bradford Hill states that this point should not be overemphasized, as it is entirely possible for an agent to cause two different types of cancer or for a foodstuff to be a vector of multiple types of infectious agents, for example. (74) Fourth, a suspected cause was deemed temporally consistent if exposure to the risk factor preceded the outcome (the disease BEN). The fifth criterion evaluated was biological gradient/dose-response relationship: whether higher exposures to the suspected agent are associated with higher incidence of disease in populations. Sixth, plausibility was evaluated: that a biologically plausible mechanism may exist for an agent to cause the disease.",

AL-DNA adducts specific to AA exposure have been found in humans-specifically, those with BEN-and replicated in animal studies. (5, 71, (82) (83) (84) A strong association between exposure to AA and development of BEN exists through the finding of AL-DNA adducts in the renal tissues of patients taking Chinese herbal medicines known to contain AA, but not in patients with renal diseases residing in a non-BENendemic village. (5) Nortier (85) found that cumulative dose of AA was a significant risk factor for UUC. This was confirmed by Lai et al., (86) who found that prescriptions of Chinese herbal medicines such that lifetime cumulative AA exposure exceeded 150 mg was associated with higher risk of developing UUC (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.1-1.8). Linking these findings back to high-risk Balkan populations, Jelakovic et al. (87) found AL-DNA adducts in 70% of UUC patients residing in a BEN-endemic village, but found no AL-DNA in adducts in 10 renal patients who resided in nonendemic areas. Because of the strong association of the exposure to the specific disease and the evidence of AA-specific DNA damage, AA was rated as \"high\" based on the BHC evaluation.",

(7, 17, 38, 66, 88) 32 P-postlabeling analyses of DNA obtained from urinary tract tumors (UTTs) of humans (88) and tissues from animals treated with OTA (7) identified such adducts; moreover, two food survey studies (49, 51) found higher OTA levels in food samples from BEN-endemic areas than nonendemic areas. Urinary and serum OTA has been found at higher levels, and more often, in affected families living in BEN-endemic areas compared to people living in non-BEN-endemic villages, (50, 52, 89) although serum OTA is not a validated biomarker of exposure. In other studies, however, researchers could not detect OTA-DNA adducts in cells or rodents treated with OTA. (46, 67) Pfohl-Leszkowicz and Manderville (7) suggest that differences in methodology may explain the interlaboratory differences in not finding OTA-DNA adducts in humans and/or animals. Some associations appear to exist based on epidemiological, biochemical, and geographical studies between OTA and BEN. (50, 89, 90) Based on the BHC evaluation, OTA was scored as \"moderate-high.\"",

            "text": "It is important to point out the similarities and differences in methodologies associated with both AL-DNA and OTA-DNA adducts, due to the debate surrounding their identification in both humans and animals. Detection of both OTA-DNA and AL-DNA adducts in humans and animals have used 32 P-postlabeling/PAGE techniques after DNA isolation and digestion. 32 P-postlabeling is commonly used to detect environmental exposures in humans and animals because only microgram quantities of DNA are required for analysis. (91) Specifically, for AL-DNA adducts, Grollman et al. (5) obtained renal tumor tissue from women with end-stage renal failure, confirmed their diagnosis with a histopathologic examination, and used the 32 P-postlabeling assay to detect AL-DNA adducts. Similarly, the 32 Ppostlabeling process is used for detection of OTA-DNA adducts in humans and animals. The issue with this process is the reproducibility of results. Sev-eral laboratories have been unable to detect OTA-DNA adducts in animal studies. (46, 92) Researchers who have successfully isolated OTA-DNA adducts argue that the interlaboratory differences are due to varying details in methodologies. (7) For Pliocene coal PAHs, the strength of association with BEN is \"low.\" No data exist on these agents causing DNA damage specific to the characteristics of BEN, either in the Balkans or in other parts of the world. Moreover, studies on differential exposure to these agents in endemic and nonendemic areas are limited and conflicting. Goldberg et al. (30) reported differences between BEN-endemic and nonendemic villages' excitation/emission matrices of water, and two studies found potentially toxic substances in water collected at BEN-endemic areas at higher levels than in nonendemic areas. (31, 32) More recently, however, Voice et al. (33) found low PAH levels in both BEN-endemic and nonendemic areas, and no higher levels of dissolved organic compounds that leach from coal in BEN villages compared with nonendemic villages. They concluded that there was no basis to connect PAH exposures, or other exposures associated with Pliocene coal, to the etiology of BEN.",

Since BEN has commonly been found in farming communities, close contact with pigs had been postulated to have an association with increased BEN risk. (6, 22, 92) In turn, coronaviruses have been isolated from pigs and suggested as a cause in BEN; however, evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking. (6) As for other viruses, antibodies for the papillomaviruses BK and SV40 were isolated from BEN patients; however, antibodies for these viruses were also isolated in healthy subjects from endemic and nonendemic areas. (6, 23) Furthermore, broader searches for these viruses in BEN patients have not been successful. (6, 24) Strength of association was highest for AA, due to the number of studies indicating the presence of AL-DNA adducts in individuals with BEN or BENlike diseases who consumed products containing AA. Furthermore, there is a lack of studies contradicting these results. In the case of OTA, the evidence for adducts that may be related to BEN is more contradictory. Some researchers were not able to detect OTA-DNA adducts, nor to associate them with BEN, (46, 93) while others were, (46, 92) which led to its lower score when compared to AA. Pliocene coal/PAH etiology in BEN was scored low, due to a lack of information explaining DNA damage specific to BEN, and conflicting reports on differential exposures in BEN versus non-BEN areas. Finally, data supporting bacteria and viruses were lacking, with some studies unable to detect viruses in BEN patients and others finding viruses in otherwise healthy individuals. For these reasons, bacteria and viruses were scored low as well in strength of association to BEN risk.",

The presence of BEN/AAN/CHN has been reported consistently worldwide in human populations known to be exposed to AA. CHN, later described as AAN, was first detected in Belgian woman in the early 1990s in women using medicines containing AA. (94) Epidemiologic data from Taiwan showed a strong association between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and the use of herbal medicines known to contain AA. (95, 96) Medicines containing AA have also been associated with high CKD rates in India. (97) Exposure to AA in BEN-endemic regions was confirmed by Ivic (98) and Hranjec (73) when they found A. clematitis to co-occur with wheat in the Balkans, and the seeds of the weeds to contain AA. Ingestion of wheat contaminated with AA over a period of 8-10 years results in exposure similar to the Belgian women, resulting in BEN. (73) Data are also consistent across animal species. (72, 83, (99) (100) (101) (102) (103) (104) (105) (106) (107) (108) (109) (110) (111) (112) (113) (114) (115) (116) (117) AL-DNA adducts have been found in humans and the carcinogenic and nephrotoxic effects were confirmed by treating rabbits with low doses of AA. (72) These data meet the criterion for consistency at a \"high\" level.",

The epidemiologic triad model examines host, environment, and agent factors of a particular disease: factors that are already described in the above analyses. The wheel of causation model places genetic factors in the center of the wheel, and varies the size of biological, social, physical, and host components depending on their influence. In this specific instance of BEN, such a model would only be useful if it were presupposed that BEN were related to genetic factors, but evidence exists to the contrary. (8, 80, 81) Finally, causal inference methods outlined by Cox (78) were also considered, and several for which sufficient studies existed on BEN were applied to examining BEN etiology.

The literature provides consistent and convincing evidence of the dosedependent relationship between AA exposure and BEN/related diseases in multiple populations worldwide. A mode of toxicity has been proposed as well. We interpret the body of evidence as showing a clear and consistent link between AA exposure and BEN, with no studies to contradict these findings; hence, AA received \"high\" scores for eight of the nine BHC. The one area in which we assigned less than a high degree of association is plausibility because, to date, no AA has been detected in foodstuffs consumed in the Balkans. Future studies should focus on analyzing grain-based foods in the at-risk rural Balkan areas for AA; and, if possible, analyzing any existing food samples from past years for AA. A comparison should be done on AA content in foods from the BEN-endemic versus non-BENendemic regions to further increase the weight of evidence that AA is the causal risk factor for BEN. If AA cannot be detected in the foods, it does not necessarily mean that AA is not the etiologic agent in causing BEN, given the strong evidence provided by the presence of AL-DNA adducts in BEN patients versus no detectable AL-DNA adducts in patients from non-BEN-endemic areas. It may be that the exposure route is different from ingestion of locally grown and produced foods, that AA is currently impossible to detect in grains given available analytical methods, or that food today does not contain AA at the same levels as food in past decades, which may be causing BEN cases today.",

This is based on studies indicating that OTA exposure is higher in BEN-endemic areas than non-BEN-endemic areas; however, other parts of the world with equally high OTA exposures do not report BEN incidence, and other parts of the world with disease manifestations similar to BEN do not have notably high OTA exposure.

(7) OTA-DNA adducts have been found in the kidneys of both rats and mice, (148) as well as in the liver and spleen of others, (149) and similar adducts have been found in BEN patients' bladder and kidney tumors. (88) On the other hand, many researchers have been unable to detect OTA-DNA adducts in animals or humans (46, 67, 93) and argue that any adverse effects of OTA are likely a result of some indirect mechanism involving oxidative stress (150, 151) or cytotoxicity.
