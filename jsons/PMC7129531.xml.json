            "text": "The acute phase protein \u03b11-acid glycoprotein (AGP) increases in several inflammatory and neoplastic conditions of cats (Paltrinieri in press). In cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), caused by feline coronavirus (FCoV), the increase of AGP is particularly evident (Duthie et al., 1997, Paltrinieri et al., 2007a) and AGP is hyposialylated (Ceciliani et al 2004). In a previous study (Paltrinieri et al 2007b) we demonstrated that AGP increased before the appearance of FIP, even in FCoV-infected cats that remain non-symptomatic, suggesting that an inflammatory response is mounted, even in those cats that do not develop FIP. In the study cited above, faecally shed FCoVs were not quantified or sequenced, therefore, hampering the ability to assess whether the increased serum AGP levels was a consequence of the higher viral load of non-mutated FCoVs or a protective response against mutant strains. However, 1 month later, the percentage of shedders decreased, suggesting a direct association between these phenomena, possibly mediated by altered sialylation of circulating AGP. Quantifying the faecal shedding of FCoV and the degree of AGP sialylation would contribute to our understanding of the host\u2013FCoVs interactions.",

Only samples with sufficient volumes remaining to proceed with AGP purification (and the corresponding faecal samples) were included in the present study. Cats were grouped as follows:(A)Specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats: six sera (provided by Prof Hans Lutz and Dr Marina Meli, Zurich University) from three domestic shorthair (DSH) SPF cats (sampled twice at a 60-day interval), whose serum AGP level was low and stable over the time (\nTable 1).(B)Non-symptomatic FCoV-infected cats from a cattery with low prevalence of FIP. This group corresponds to group B3 in the previous study, which recorded only one case of FIP in the past 5 years. The five cats (DSH) of this cattery were sampled monthly for 4 months. Faecal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of these cats (performed using the same method employed in the former study) was only occasionally positive, and serum antibody titres (immunofluorescence test) were low (median 1:25; range: 0\u20131:50). Based on these data, the cattery was classified as having a \u2018low prevalence of FCoV infection\u2019. In the present study, only samples from three cats, sampled at day 0, 30 and 90, were available. The serum AGP concentration did not show significant differences over time (Table 1).(C)Non-symptomatic FCoV-infected cats from a cattery with high prevalence of FIP. This group corresponds to group B1 of the previous study. In that study, 10 Persian cats from a cattery that recorded between one and four cases of FIP per year were sampled monthly for 7 months. Both the percentage of shedders (50\u2013100%) and the FCoV antibody titres (median 1:200; range: 1:50\u20131:400) were variable. Based on these data, the cattery was classified as having a \u2018high prevalence of FCoV infection\u2019. Samples from seven cats were included in the present study. Their AGP levels varied over time, with high concentrations seen at sample 5 (Table 1).\n",

Specifically, the digoxigenin-conjugated lectins Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNAI) (Roche Diagnostic, Penzberg, Germany), specific for sialic acid \u03b1(2,6)-linked to galactose, and Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA) (Roche), specific for sialic acid \u03b1(2,3)-linked to galactose were employed. Positivity was detected with the Glycan differentiation kit (Roche), using an alkaline phosphatase conjugated sheep anti-digoxigenin immunoglobulin. Densitometric analysis was performed using the Imagemaster 1D software (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, USA). In order to relatively quantify sialic acid, part of the AGP purified from SPF cats was pooled and used as a reference material. The amount of sialic acid was expressed as a percentage of intensity compared to the reference material (arbitrarily considered as 100%). Within each group, the results of sequential time-samplings were compared to each other using the non-parametric Friedman's analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni test.",

            "text": "For both the lectins (Table 1), the results of SPF cats were closely distributed around the value of the pooled serum, while groups B and C showed a high individual variability. This variability, together with the low number of animals examined, was likely responsible for the lack of significant differences in spite of evident variations in mean values among sequential samplings. Nevertheless, in group C the sialic acid \u03b1(2,6)-linked to galactose tended to decrease at samplings 4 and 5, and significantly increased at samplings 6 and 7. The only difference between group C and other groups was the breed composition and the level of FCoV contamination. Breed-related differences of AGP sialylation are unlikely, based on the results of tests performed on cats of different breeds (data not included in this study). The difference recorded is, thus, likely depending on FCoV infection. Interestingly, in the previous study both the antibody titres and the concentration of AGP increased at sampling 5, 2 weeks before the occurrence of episodes of FIP in the cattery. The increased sialylation recorded here could thus be interpreted as a protective response against the virus, possibly mediated by an interaction between FCoVs and sialylated AGP. Moreover, hypersialylation elongates the half-life of circulating proteins (Gregoriadis et al 2005) which may partly explain why the concentration of serum AGP did not show, at sampling 7, the same increase recorded at sampling 5 (both these samplings were followed by outbreaks of FIP). In humans, AGP has immunomodulatory functions (Vasson et al 1994) and its degree of glycosylation influences susceptibility or resistance to viruses (Rabehi et al 1995). Some species of coronavirus have a high affinity for sialylated molecules (Schwegmann-Wessels and Herrler 2006), and, although the affinity of FCoVs for sialic acid has not yet been investigated, the results presented here stimulate future research on this topic.",
