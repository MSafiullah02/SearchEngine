The Old World family of arenaviruses contains, among others, Lassa virus (LASV), which can cause hemorrhagic fever and is endemic in West Africa [1]; lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which causes febrile illness, neurological disease and birth defects with a 2\u20135% seroprevalence in North America and Europe [2]; and the 80% lethal hemorrhagic fever virus Lujo (LUJV), which emerged in Southern Africa in 2008 [3]. Arenaviruses in the New World category include Machupo virus (MACV, [4]) and Junin virus (JUNV, [5]), the causative agents of Bolivian and Argentinian hemorrhagic fever, respectively, as well numerous other agents such as Sab\u00eda virus [6] and Guanarito virus [7].",

It is the sole antigen on the viral surface, the primary target of protective humoral immune responses [8\u2022,9\u2022] and a focus for vaccine design efforts. For all arenaviruses, GPC is a trimer that is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain and is subsequently cleaved by host cell proteases to attain its fusion-competent state. The mature GPC is a trimer of heterotrimers composed of the non-covalently associated subunits SSP, GP1 and GP2. SSP is the transmembrane stable signal peptide and is essential for viral infectivity [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. GP1 binds receptor and determines tropism [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. GP2 drives fusion of virus and host membranes, wherein GP2 undergoes an acid pH-driven, conformational change from a metastable, prefusion structure to a more stable, postfusion, six-helix bundle [26, 27, 28].",

Pathogenic New World arenaviruses such as MACV and JUNV use Transferrin Receptor 1 (TfR1) to enter cells [21]. Old World arenaviruses, such as LASV, bind to a sugar termed matriglycan attached to the protein alpha-dystroglycan (\u03b1DG) as their extracellular receptor [29, 30, 31]. LUJV appears to be different yet again and uses the recently identified protein neuropilin 2 (NRP2) as a receptor [32]. LASV requires the endosomal receptor LAMP1 for entry [33\u2022\u2022], while LUJV requires the endosomal entry factor CD63 [32]. Use of both cell-surface and endosomal entry factors may be a feature shared amongst some pathogenic Old World arenaviruses, but is a feature not known for New World arenaviruses.",

Class I fusion proteins require a proteolytic cleavage event to release the fusion peptide or loop of the membrane-proximal subunit (termed GP2 in the case of the arenaviruses) from the polyprotein and allows the glycoprotein to adopt a metastable prefusion state. This inherent metastability coupled with the lack of a covalent linkage between the GP1 and GP2 subunits hindered determination of the prefusion arenavirus GPC trimer structure for many years. However, these challenges were recently overcome by structure-based design of a di-cysteine linkage between the GP1 and GP2 subunit to enable the GPC to be processed, yet maintain a prefusion state [41,42\u2022\u2022].",

There, it facilitates trimerization by packing against the GP1 subunit of the neighboring monomer (Figure 1b).",

First, in every type I viral glycoprotein structure determined to date, the trimer is formed about a central three-helix bundle of the fusion subunit (Figure 2\na). This three-helix core remains largely unaltered in structure upon transition from the prefusion conformation to that of the postfusion conformation. LASV GPC, however, lacks such a core and instead the equivalent region of GP2 is oriented nearly perpendicularly to the threefold axis. As a result, every section of LASV GP2 must unravel from the GPC protomer and move upon viral and host cell fusion (Figure 2b). Secondly, in each of the other class I fusion GPs, the cleavage site, which releases the equivalent GP1 and GP2 termini from each other, is located more or less on the outside of the trimer. In contrast, the N-terminus of LASV GP2 is oriented towards the core of the trimer and lies at the threefold axis, while the LASV GP1 C terminus, once released from GP2, rotates 30 \u00c5 up towards the apex of the trimer and is buried in a hydrophobic pocket of the neighboring monomer [41,42\u2022\u2022] (Figure 2a).",

These recent structural and biochemical data suggest that in additional to the known and well-characterized structural changes that occur in the GP2 subunit, there are also significant conformational changes that occur in GP1 during low pH-mediated LASV entry. The conformational switch in LASV GP1, from prefusion to a different conformation, perhaps a `primed\u2019 conformation, is likely related to the receptor switching to LAMP1 that occurs in the endosome. Indeed, the repositioning of the N and C termini of GP1 results in the relocation of residues contained in the histidine triad identified by the Diskin group as a pH-sensor for LAMP1 switching [37\u2022,38\u2022\u2022,43] (Figure 3b). Further, the Diskin group also recently identified residues in the conformationally flexible \u03b2-hairpin as major determinants for LAMP1 binding [38\u2022\u2022] (Figure 3b).",

The multiple steps in entry and multiple forms of the LASV glycoprotein suggests that antibodies that target a single subunit conformation could be less effective. Indeed, the most potent antibodies are those that can stabilize the GPC protomer in a prefusion state [8\u2022]. These antibodies prevent not only the conformational changes that occur in GP2, but also the appearance of a `primed\u2019 GP1 [42\u2022\u2022]. In contrast, antibodies that bind to the GP1 subunit only when it is in its prefusion conformation may lose their ability neutralize unless they are also able to prevent the appearance of primed GP1 during viral entry.",

LASV GP1 can be divided into three subdomains: (1) the N-terminal \u03b2-strands (purple, interacting with GP2); (2) the upper, \u03b2-sheet core (blue); and (3) the lower helix-loop surface (dark red). LASV GP2 can be divided into four subdomains: (1) the fusion region (cyan), which is composed of the fusion peptide and fusion loop; (2) HR1a-d (yellow); (3) the T-loop (magenta); and (4) HR2 (green). N-linked glycosylation sites are shown as spheres and numbered on their respective Asn residue. GP monomers B and C are shown as surfaces. The C terminus of each GP1 subunit is indicated with an arrow and the N termini of the GP2 subunits, which are positioned at the threefold axis and 30 \u00c5 below the apex of the trimer, are indicated with a star. A linear representation of the GPC protomer is shown a bottom with each subdomain of GPC colored according to the cartoon representation, with each N-linked glycosylation site indicated with a `Y\u2019.",

            "text": "Figure 2: The LASV GP trimer is unique amongst class I glycoproteins. Comparison of the LASV GP trimer to the trimeric structures of the class I glycoproteins from Ebola virus (PDB: 5JQ7), HIV (PDB: 4NCO), Coronavirus (PDB: 5I08), Influenza (PDB: 1RUZ) and Paramyxovirus F (PDB: 2B9B) are shown. For EBOV, HIV, Influenza and CoV, the GP1-equivalent subunit for each virus is colored dark blue and the GP2-equivalent subunit is colored cyan. The three-helix core of each viral glycoprotein and the equivalent region in LASV GP2 is colored yellow. Note: Paramyxoviruses such as PiV5 have two surface glycoproteins, of which F is responsible for fusion of viral and host cell membranes. The larger, carboxy-terminal domain, F1, is colored cyan and the smaller, N-terminal domain, F2, is colored dark blue. A three-helix bundle is formed by the HRB subdomain of F1 and is colored yellow. The C-termini and N-termini of each subunit (GP1 and GP2 equivalent for EBOV, HIV, Influenza and CoV and F1 and F2 for PiV 5) are shown as spheres and indicated by arrows. (b) Comparison between prefusion LASV GP2 and postfusion GP2 of LCMV (PDB: 3MKO), a close relative of LASV. In the prefusion conformation of LASV GP2, HR1 (yellow) is broken up into four segments (HR1a-d) and connected to HR2 through the T-loop (pink), which forms a \u03b2-sheet with \u03b21 of GP1. In contrast, in the postfusion conformation of GP2, HR1 forms a single \u03b1 helix while the T-loop forms an \u03b1 helix. The relative locations of the viral membrane in the prefusion state and the fused viral and host cell membranes in the postfusion state are indicated. The fusion peptide residues were not included in the postfusion GP2 crystallization construct but would be embedded in the fused membranes.",

Despite low sequence similarity of 20%, the GP1 subunits of LASV and MACV align with an r.m.s.d. of 2 \u00c5. Major differences map to the loops that connect the \u03b2-sheet. For clarity, only the MACV GP1 subunit is shown; other New World arenavirus GP1 subunits align with similar r.m.s.d.s. (b) Overlay of the crystal structures of prefusion GP1, solved at neutral pH (gray, PDB: 5VK2), to the `primed\u2019 GP1 subunit of LASV determined at pH 5 (cyan, PDB: 4ZJF). The histidine triad responsible for sensing pH [37\u2022,43] is shown as ball and stick and is colored gray at neutral pH and red at pH 5. The LAMP1 binding site as it exists at pH 5 is colored purple [38\u2022\u2022]. Structural elements of LASV GP1 that vary between the low-pH and neutral-pH forms are indicated.

(a) Left: Side view of a surface representation of the LASV GP trimer is shown with N-glycosylation sites shown as blue spheres. The GP1 subunit is colored light gray and the GP2 subunit colored dark gray. The TfR1 binding site for pathogenic New World arenaviruses such as MACV and JUNV has been mapped onto the LASV GP structure and is colored light blue; the LAMP1 binding site (as it exists in the context of the trimer) is colored purple. Right: The top view of the trimer highlights residues involved in binding to the LASV and LCMV receptor \u03b1DG (yellow) [22, 23, 24,41,51]. Note that for LASV and LCMV GPC, not GP1 alone, is required for cell surface receptor binding [41,52]. Hence, a quaternary assembly of GP1, provided only in the context of the GPC, may be necessary for \u03b1DG engagement. (b) LASV neutralizing antibody epitopes are colored by epitope group: GP1-A, which recognizes the GP1 subunit alone is colored green; GPC-A, which recognizes a single prefusion GP monomer is colored purple; GPC-B, which recognizes a quaternary epitope that spans two GP monomers within the trimer is colored peach. Neutralizing antibodies against JUNV GP1 are colored yellow and partially overlap with those of the LASV GP1-A group.",
