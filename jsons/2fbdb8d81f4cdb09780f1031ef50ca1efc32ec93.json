Since January 21, WHO reports daily data on confirmed cases and deaths from both China and other countries [1] . In this work we present some discrete and continuous models to discribe the disease dynamics in China and estimate the needed epidemiological parameters. Good agreement with the current dynamics has be found for both a discrete transmission model and a slightly modified SIR-model.",

In the meantime, these cases have been identified as infections with a novel strain of coronavirus, called 2019-nCoV. Its genome sequence turned out to be 75-to 80-percent identical to the SARS-coronavirus, that caused a major outbreak in Asai in 2003. At the beginning of January 2020, the virus spread over mainland China and reached other provinces. Increased travel activities due to the Chinese new year festivities supported the expansion of the infection. By mid of January, China reported a sharp rise in cases with about 150 new patients. From January 21 onwards, WHO's daily situation reports contain the latest figures on confirmed cases and deaths, see [1] . Our work is based on these data for the mainland of China. The National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China also provides daily reports [2] , however this website is only available in Chinese and hence we did not use it for our analysis. By Y k we denote the cumulated Corona cases in mainland China on day k, where k = 0 corresponds to beginning of the data recordings on January, 21. In Figure 1 we show the data until February, 9 in a semi-logarithmic plot. The new cases N k := Y k \u2212 Y k\u22121 are also given. The data for other countries than China is not included in our first modeling approach. ",

This can be seen as well, when plotting the infected cases on the next day Y k+1 vs. the infected cases today Y k in a double logarithmic plot, see. a straight line of slope 1 in the double log-plot.

Another possible extension of the exponential model takes into account the effect of awareness in the population.

Including the first data point (see dashed line in Figure 4 ) yields a fit with a smaller R 2 -value of 0.8011 showing a lower quality of the fit. Moreover, in this case, we would again drastically over-estimate the current behavior. Figure 4 again shows the reduction of new infections in the last days. The last three data points significantly deviate from the previous behavior which can be described rather well by the nonlinear model. In Figure 5 we show the prediction based on the generalized model (Gen)(green curve) and the nonlinear model (NonLin) (blue curve) compared to the observed data. The two models are extended 10 days beyond the current date to show their predictions. On the time interval, where data is available, both models yield very similar estimates, but for future predictions, the generalized exponential model shows significantly lower case numbers. Based on the reduced number of new infection in the last days, it seems that the generalized model (Gen) is better suited to describe the future disease dynamics.",
