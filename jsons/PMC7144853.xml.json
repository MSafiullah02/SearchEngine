With the availability of an effective live attenuated Junin virus vaccine, a consistent reduction in the incidence of AHF was achieved in the 1990s (Enria and Barrera Oro, 2002, Enria et al., 2004).

Other common symptoms include retro-orbital pain, nausea or vomiting, epigastric pain, photophobia, dizziness, constipation or mild diarrhea. Physical examination reveals flushing of the face, neck and upper chest; conjunctival congestion and periorbital edema. The gums look congested and may bleed spontaneously or under slight pressure. Over the soft palate, an enanthem represented by petechiae and small vesicles is almost constantly found. Typically, the patients have cutaneous petechiae in the axillary regions, upper chest and arms. Lymph nodes in the laterocervical regions are enlarged. Generally, no signs of pulmonary abnormalities are detected. Relative bradycardia and orthostatic hypotension are frequently found. Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and jaundice are very rare. At the end of this phase the patient may be irritable, lethargic, and with a fine tremor of the hand and tongue. Moderate ataxia, cutaneous hyperesthesia, and a decrease in deep tendon reflexes and muscular tonicity are present. In females, the presence of metrorrhagia is characteristic.

Guinea pigs reproduce most of the human lesions, with increasing viraemia from day 7 post-infection until death around day 13. Infected guinea pigs developed leucopenia and thrombocytopenia, reproduced the hemorrhagic manifestations of AHF, and died without detectable antibodies. In this model, immune serum treatment decreased the mortality when administrated 1 day before or 5 days after the infection. In animals treated after day 9 of infection, the mortality was not modified, but all died without the classic hemorrhagic manifestations of the illness (Weissenbacher et al., 1968). In the same animal model infected with Junin virus and treated with pooled, homologous immune serum, with titers of antibodies measured in therapeutic units of immune sera, the sera prevented all signs of illness when administered 24 h after infection, and also prevented illness and death as late as 6 days after infection if the amount of therapeutic units were increased (Kenyon et al., 1990). Some surviving animals developed a late neurological syndrome with prominent hind-limb paralysis (Kenyon et al., 1986b). Treatment of guinea pigs with ribavirin or tributylribavirin did not reduce mortality, although viral replication was delayed and the mean time of death prolonged (Kenyon et al., 1986a).",

Common findings include hemorrhage, bone marrow necrosis, mild hepatocellular necrosis, poliencephalomyelitis and autonomic glanglioneuritis. Callithrix jacchus infected with Junin virus developed acute hematological and neurological manifestations with anemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia and died within 17\u201324 days after inoculation without demonstrable anti-Junin antibodies. Immune serum treatment of Junin virus-infected marmosets was found to reduce mortality from 100% to 25%. Viraemias and viral titers in organs were lowered and late neurological signs appeared in 30% of treated survivors (Weissenbacher et al., 1986a, Weissenbacher et al., 1986b, Avila et al., 1987). The treatment of Junin virus infected C. jacchus with the antiviral ribavirin resulted in an increased in survival rates and in a delay of the mean day of death. Rhesus macaques infected with different strains of Junin virus obtained from humans with different clinical forms of AHF developed anorexia, lassitude, gastrointestinal disturbances and vascular phenomena during the second week after inoculation. The late disease patterns induced by the strains were analogous to those seen in humans from whom they were derived (McKee et al., 1987, Green et al., 1987). Prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of Junin virus infected rhesus macaques with ribavirin proved useful in modifying the initial course of illness, although survivors developed a late-onset central nervous system illness, with some deaths (McKee et al., 1988).",

They were used based on the beneficial effect obtained either preventing the development of the illness, decreasing the severity of the disease or preventing the development of complications, according to the time at which they were administered (Gross et al., 1959, Rinaldo, 2005). In AHF, almost since the discovery of Junin virus, plasma coming from persons who had AHF on clinical grounds was used as a therapeutic measure. This empirical use was based on the advantageous results that had been reported in hepatitis, rubella, poliomyelitis, mumps and measles. The results obtained were reported to be satisfactory, but there had been no attempts to measure its efficacy. By the 1970s the beneficial effects of this form of treatment were considered inconclusive and for this reason, a placebo-controlled trial was designed (Ruggiero et al., 1964, Ruggiero et al., 1977).",

Immune plasma banks with available units of certified quality were established around the AHF endemic area. As the treatment is only effective when transfused during the first week of illness (Enria and Maiztegui, 1994), an intensive training program among physician and nurses of the endemic area was developed in order to accomplish the early clinical diagnosis required. This was done in conjunction with a comprehensive activity of education in health in the affected communities with the objective of promoting the immediate medical consultancy under the presence of febrile sign and symptoms.

The viremia was shown to be reduced in AHF patients after the transfusion of immune plasma (Montardit et al., 1979). Till the beginning of the 1980s, complement fixation and indirect immunofluorescence were the methods used for the serological diagnosis of AHF, and for the selection of immune plasma donors. When it became possible to standardize a plaque neutralization assay in cell culture, it was found that titers varied widely in people who had AHF. On the other hand, there was no correlation among the titers of complement fixation, immunofluorescence and neutralizing antibodies in an individual's sera. It was then decided to determine whether a low dose of neutralizing antibodies was associated with a higher mortality and to define the therapeutic dose of immune plasma on the basis of the quantity of neutralizing antibodies to be given. The \u201ctherapeutic units\u201d of neutralizing antibodies were calculated from the body weight of the patient and the weight and titer of neutralizing antibodies in each unit of immune plasma given:TU (kg)=\u2211(weight\u00d7titer of each unit)body weight\n",

The only adverse effect observed in the ribavirin-treated AHF patients was the development of anemia, an event previously documented among the secondary reactions to this drug (Shulman, 1984). On the other hand, 1 of the 10 survivors treated with ribavirin developed during early convalescence a febrile syndrome with alterations in the CSF, and abnormalities in the evoked responses similar to the ones described in AHF patients treated with immune plasma with a LNS (Cristiano et al., 1985, Enria, 2005). This finding suggests that treatment with ribavirin in AHF might be expected to result in some cases in an untoward effect similar to that produced by immune plasma treatment.",

The patients would receive ribavirin for 2 days, and upon finishing this treatment would also receive a transfusion of immune plasma early enough to be effective, given that all cases would have received it within 8 days from onset of symptoms.

With the availability of the effective live attenuated Junin virus vaccine Candid #1, a marked reduction in the incidence of AHF was achieved (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). On the other hand, a new geographic extension of the endemic area was registered in the last decades involving the surroundings of a big city (Rosario), which has more than 1,000,000 inhabitants. In this new situation, the early recognition of AHF according to the algorithm proposed by the National Program for AHF control is not as operative as before (Fig. 4\n). AHF diagnosis is established more frequently late in the course of the illness in a smaller number of patients, resulting in an increase in the case-fatality rate (Fig. 3). The reduction in disease incidence also heralds future problems with the availability of plasma donors. Although plasma from Candid #1 vaccinees can be used as an alternative source, the neutralizing antibody titers in vaccinees are much lowered than those in convalescents of the illness (Enria and Barrera Oro, 2002).",

On the other hand, new treatments for severe cases that evolve to a hemorrhagic and/or neurological form of the illness are also needed.\u2022There are suitable animal models and there would be some possibilities for the performance of clinical trials if new products are developed.\u2022Ribavirin may prove useful in AHF treatment provided that the drug is initiated early in the course of the illness. There should be a guarantee of continuous supply of the drug and a reduction in its cost to consider its evaluation in a clinical trial.\n",
