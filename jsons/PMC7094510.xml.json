Adult and growing pigs were also affected, which was different from classical PRRS.5 In 2007, an almost identical atypical PRRSV was found to be epidemic in Vietnam and China.6 Presently, only inactivated or attenuated vaccines are available to combat PRRS, but their efficacy is less than satisfactory due to adaptive evolution of PRRSV,7, 8 especially in the cases of the atypical PRRS outbreaks in China and Vietnam.5, 6 This urgent issue prompted us to exploit the possibility of drug discovery for treatment of the highly pathogenic PRRSV infection.",

The structure of the enzyme reveals two chymotrypsin-like \u03b2-barrel domains and an extra C-terminal \u03b1/\u03b2 domain similar to that observed in EAV nsp4.12 A canonical catalytic triad that is composed of Ser118, His39, and Asp64 is located in the open cleft between the two \u03b2-barrel domains. An S1 subsite consisting of His133 and very likely Ser136 and an oxyanion hole without the signature helix-like turn are seen in our structure. Our results also clearly show that the recombinant enzyme displays proteolytic activity in vitro. Besides, based on the results of the cleavage assay, three nsp junction sites in the PRRSV replicase precursor are confirmed, thereby shedding light on the processing pathway of pp1a and pp1ab in the virus.",

The in vitro peptide cleavage assay in this study was performed using this recombinant enzyme with the nine extra residues present, while for the cis cleavage assay, even more additional N-terminal residues were present (Fig. 1b). In both cases, the recombinant protein displayed proteolytic activity in vitro, thereby confirming the identity of nsp4 as the main protease in PRRSV replication (see results below).",

The N-terminal \u03b2-barrel (domain I) consists of six \u03b2-strands (aI to fI) and a short \u03b1-helix (helix A) that closes the barrel like a lid, whereas the middle \u03b2-barrel (domain II) comprises seven \u03b2-strands (aII to gII) and is connected to domain I via a very long loop (amino acids 69\u201389) (Fig. 2a). The catalytic site is located at the opening of the cleft between domains I and II and consists of residues Ser118, His39, and Asp64 (Fig. 2a), which are totally conserved among members of the Arteriviridae (Fig. 2c). The extra C-terminal domain (domain III) comprises residues 157\u2013199 and consists of two pairs of short antiparallel \u03b2-sheets (strands aIII\u2013cIII and bIII\u2013dIII) and two \u03b1-helices. The crossing angle is \u223c 90\u00b0 between helix B and helix C (Fig. 2a). A long N-terminal loop extends over domain II to the vicinity of domain III. The orientation of this loop is stabilized by the three hydrogen bonds Arg4 N\u2026Glu100 OE1, Thr5 N\u2026Val99 O, and Thr5 OG1\u2026Val99 N (Fig. 2a). The phenyl ring of Phe3 is directed into the hydrophobic interface between domains II and III and, therefore, also helps to stabilize the orientation of the N-terminal loop (Fig. 5a, left image).",

As the prototype structure of nsp4s in Arteriviridae, the EAV 3CLSP also folds into three domains.12 Superposing domains I and II of PRRSV 3CLSP onto those of the EAV nsp4 (copy A of the four copies in the asymmetric unit) yielded an r.m.s.d. of 2.04 \u00c5 for 122 equivalent (out of 134 compared) C\u03b1 pairs (Fig. 3a), while domain III alone exhibited an r.m.s.d. of 0.52 \u00c5 for 30 (out of 38) C\u03b1 pairs (Fig. 3d), indicating that the two enzymes share great structural similarity at the tertiary level. However, the steric arrangement of the domains in the two proteases is quite different. An \u223c 8 \u00c5 shift of domain III relative to domains I and II was observed in our structure, when compared to EAV nsp4. This shift causes the whole domain III to move away from the cleft where the catalytic triad is located (Fig. 3a). Clear electron density for the loop Asn153-Ile157 that connects domains II and III, as shown in Fig. 3c, leaves no doubt about the chain tracing of the loop and verifies the  8-\u00c5 shift of domain III, compared to EAV nsp4. The shift may also account for our failure to solve the structure by MR using EAV nsp4 as the search model.",

To identify the possible residues that may be involved in the formation of the S1 pocket in PRRSV 3CLSP, we used the structure of Streptomyces griseus proteinase E (SGPE) in complex with a tetrapeptide as the reference structure for superposition. SGPE is another chymotrypsin-like proteinase that has a substrate preference for Glu at the P1 position.20 Both the EAV nsp4 (copy A) and our structure were aligned. As shown in Fig. 4a, the S1 specificity pocket of both the SGPE and EAV nsp4 is composed of three residues, with a conserved His (His134 in EAV nsp4 and His213 in SGPE) lying at the bottom of the pocket and one Ser (EAV nsp4: Ser137; SGPE: Ser216) lining one side and another Thr/Ser (EAV nsp4: Thr115; SGPE: Ser192) located on the opposite side. However, only the histidine (His133) could be found in our structure. The first serine involved in the S1 subsite is conserved in PRRSV 3CLSP (Ser136) (Fig. 2c), but we cannot define its position due to the absence of electron density for the loop 136\u2013140 as mentioned before. Nevertheless, there is no residue in PRRSV nsp4 to match the Thr/Ser (Thr115 in EAV nsp4, Ser192 in SGPE) on the other side of the pocket. Thr113 of PRRSV nsp4, which is also highly conserved among members of Arteriviridae (Fig. 2c), is too far away to contact the substrate P1 residue (Fig. 4a).",

Among the nidoviruses, coronavirus 3CLpro cleavage sites always have a Gln at the P1 position.9, 23, 24 However, in the same order Nidovirales, the 3CLSPs of Arteriviridae, which are represented by the prototype EAV nsp4, show a clear preference for glutamic acid over glutamine at the P1 position of the substrate.9 In EAV, of the eight cleavage sites of the replicative polyprotein processed by the main protease, only one junction contains a glutamine at the P1 position (Q2837/S joining nsp10/11), while all other cleavage sites have glutamic acid in this position.11, 25, 26 Based on the similarity in genome organization between PRRSV and EAV, the putative cleavage sites processed by 3CLSP were predicted in PRRSV, all of which harbor a Glu at the P1 position.15 Therefore, it is a reasonable assumption that the 3CLSP of PRRSV also shows preference for Glu over Gln at the P1 position of the substrate. The peptide SP8-M was synthesized and tested for cleavage by 3CLSP to confirm this prediction. SP8-M is identical in sequence to SP8-1 except that the Glu in P1 was replaced by Gln. As shown in Fig. 6d, the retention time for this peptide is 18.3 min. As expected, after incubation of the peptide with 3CLSP for 15 h at 37 \u00b0C, only tiny amounts of cleavage products can be detected (Fig. 6e), indicating that the glutamic acid at the P1 position in the substrate is crucial for effective cleavage by 3CLSP and cannot be replaced by glutamine.",

However, processing of the nsp4/nsp5 junction is crucial for the release of the enzyme to free itself from the polyprotein precursor. Therefore, a cis cleavage assay was designed in order to investigate processing of this site. As shown in Fig. 1b, two constructs bearing the nsp4/nsp5 junction fused to a Myc epitope at the C-terminus of wild-type 3CLSP or its S118A mutant were made. Extra N-terminal and C-terminal hexa-histidine tags were introduced into the fusion proteins by the pET-28b vector to facilitate detection, resulting in the wild-type protein his-nsp4-[nsp4/nsp5]-Myc-his and the mutant product his-nsp4(S118A)-[nsp4/nsp5]-Myc-his. After expression of the two gene constructs in E. coli, an apparent molecular mass difference between the two protein products was observed in SDS-PAGE, where the mass of the wild-type protein is smaller than that of the mutant by about 3 kDa, indicating the occurrence of cis cleavage at the C-terminal junction site of his-nsp4-[nsp4/nsp5]-Myc-his (Fig. 7a). Both the wild-type and the mutant proteins were purified and subjected to Western blot analysis for detection of the Myc epitope as well as the hexa-histidine tag to confirm this conclusion. Two different amounts (2  and 1 \u03bcg) of both proteins were loaded. At both amounts, the wild-type protein showed no signal for the Myc epitope, in contrast to a strong Myc signal given by the mutant protein (Fig. 7c). Both proteins displayed an unambiguous His-tag signal, which was much stronger in the case of the mutant product, consistent with the fact that it contains a hexa-His tag at both termini while the wild-type protein only has the N-terminal tag left (Fig. 7b). These results clearly showed that his-nsp4-[nsp4/nsp5]-Myc-his removed its C-terminal tail via cis cleavage after expression.",

The structure contains residues 3\u2013199 but, like the wild-type structure, lacks electron density for the loop 136\u2013140. As shown in Fig. 8a, there is clear electron density for the catalytic center, demonstrating that substitution of Ser118 by Ala was successful. At the same time, the substitution did not change the microenvironment surrounding residue 118, as seen from the unchanged conformations of the (truncated) catalytic triad, the S1 subsite residue His133, and the oxyanion hole (see Fig. 8b).

            "text": "The S1 specificity pocket that accommodates the side chain of the substrate's P1 residue plays a vital role in substrate recognition and catalysis. In all the reported 3CLpros with known structures, a conserved histidine is found sitting at the bottom of the pocket.12, 22, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 Mutational analysis found that any replacement of this residue both in human and feline coronavirus Mpro completely abolished their proteolytic activities.34, 35 As a member of the 3C-like protease family, it is not surprising that in PRRSV nsp4, His133 is localized appropriately to fulfill this function. However, besides this conserved His, the S1 subsite of both SGPE and EAV nsp4 includes two additional Ser/Thr residues as shown in Fig. 4a,12, 20 for which no counterparts can be found in our structure. We suspect that Ser136 must also be involved in P1 side-chain recognition based on two facts. First, this Ser is absolutely conserved in arterivirus nsp4 sequences. In EAV nsp4, the same Ser has been proposed to contact the side chain of the P1 glutamic acid (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, although we cannot define the position of Ser136 due to total lack of electron density, the two residues directly preceding it are clearly defined. Therefore, Ser136 is confined to a limited steric space close to the modeled P1 residue. A hydrogen bond between this disordered residue and the P1 amino acid could help stabilize both residues upon substrate binding. We also note that loop 136\u2013140 lines one wall of the S1 subsite and is highly flexible. It may function like a lid that can partially cover the pocket after the entry of the P1 side chain and therefore help clinch the substrate to allow the occurrence of nucleophilic attack onto the scissile bond. This may also, to some extent, compensate the lack of a third partner in the S1 specificity pocket of PRRSV nsp4 (see Results). Snijder et al. reported that mutation of this third residue, Thr115 in EAV nsp4, to other amino acids can have various effects on catalysis, indicating its important role as part of the S1 subsite.11\n",

In serine proteinases, the catalytic cleavage of the substrate peptide bond is assumed to undergo a transformation from the ground planar state to a transition state that is characterized by the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate.37 The backbone NH groups (in the case of subtilisin also including the side chain of Asn155) can hydrogen-bond with the resultant carbonyl oxyanion of the substrate P1 residue during cleavage at the scissile bond and are therefore very important in catalysis.37, 38, 39, 40 Both in EAV nsp4 and SARS-CoV Mpro, two forms of the oxyanion hole were observed, an active form and a collapsed one.12, 28 Nevertheless, in both forms, the signature turn remains almost the same. In EAV nsp4, the different forms of the oxyanion hole are believed to arise mainly from the flipping of the peptide bond between Ser117 and Gly118, which is common in pairs of homologous protein structures.12, 41 However, as shown in Fig. 4b, the stretched form observed in our structure (lacking the helix-like turn) can only support the formation of one hydrogen bond with the oxyanion to stabilize the negative charge. We suspect that the hydrophobic strength of Phe112 might be the main cause for this atypical oxyanion hole. This is supported by our recent mutational work of Phe112Ala. The mutant enzyme shows some higher enzymatic activity, implying the role that Phe112 played in the formation of the atypical oxyanion hole, which might be attributed to the observed low enzymatic activity (data not shown). This needs to be verified by a clear crystal structure and further mutational work in the future. The unusual properties of both the S1 subsite and the oxyanion hole observed in our structure, as we discussed above, might well explain the low in vitro catalytic activity of PRRSV nsp4 compared to that of other 3C-like proteases in similar experiments.21, 22\n",

            "text": "As the main proteinase in Arteriviridae, nsp4 must first release itself from the replicative polyprotein to fulfill its proteolytic function of processing the downstream domains into functional replicative subunits. Unlike EAV, whose nsp4/nsp5 cleavage site is reported to be cleaved in the major processing pathway with the presence of nsp2 as the cofactor,26 we have shown in our cis cleavage assay that a quick and thorough cleavage at the C-terminus of PRRSV nsp4 occurs automatically in vitro. Therefore, based on the results obtained in this study, we propose a possible nsp4 release model for PRRSV: Translation of ORF1a is followed by a rapid autocatalytic release of nsp1\u03b1, nsp1\u03b2, and nsp2;45, 46 subsequently, the nsp4/nsp5 junction site is quickly processed via cis cleavage by the 3CLSP to yield nsp3\u2013nsp4 and nsp5\u2013nsp8. Then, a trans cleavage of the nsp3/nsp4 joining sequence occurs to generate nsp3 and free nsp4, which can then fulfill its role as the main proteinase. Nevertheless, taking into account that the trans processing of the nsp3/nsp4 junction is very slow as shown by the peptide cleavage assay (see Results), we believe that cis cleavage at this site might also happen, especially in the early stage of translation of ORF1a. In support of this, a very long N-terminal loop was observed in our structure (Fig. 2a). This terminus can be brought into an appropriate position for cis cleavage by a conformational rearrangement upon breaking of the three hydrogen bonds mentioned above. Refinement of this cleavage model will require further studies in the future.",

Either addition of extra residues to the N-terminus or deletion of the N-terminal residues is deleterious to enzyme activity.47, 48, 49 There are also many reports showing that the homodimeric form of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro is the catalytically active form and the unique C-terminal extra domain plays a key role in controlling the dimer\u2013monomer equilibrium.50, 51, 52, 53 In our previous report, we showed that the recombinant PRRSV nsp4 with nine extra amino acid residues at the N-terminus is monomeric in solution.16 These extra residues might also affect the enzymatic activity of PRRSV nsp4 and might be attributed to the high K\nm observed for the enzyme. Nevertheless, we confirm here that the recombinant enzyme displays obvious catalytic activity in vitro. Furthermore, the enzyme is actually active in vitro even with 21 extra N-terminal residues added as in the cis cleavage assay. Thus, the 3C-like proteases of Nidovirales likely evolved different proteolytic mechanisms for Coronaviridae such as SARS-CoV and Arteriviridae such as PRRSV.

Coomassie staining as well as Western blot analysis results are shown. (a) The 12% SDS-PAGE separation profile of both the wild-type and the mutant fusion proteins. The uninduced cell sample, cell lysate after induction, and the purified protein are indicated. (b) Detection of the wild-type and the mutant fusion proteins by the anti-His antibody. (c) Detection of both proteins using an anti-Myc antibody. (d) C-terminal sequencing result of the purified his-nsp4-[nsp4/nsp5]-Myc-his protein. After digestion of the protein by trypsin, a peptide fragment of 2117.06 Da was chosen to sequence by nano-ESI-MS/MS. The deduced sequence (read from right to left) is identical with that of the C-terminal portion of the his-nsp4-[nsp4/nsp5]-Myc-his protein after cleavage at the E1983/G junction, confirming the cleavage.",

(a) Stereo view of the electron density map of the mutant residue Ala118 as well as the other two residues of the catalytic triad. The 1.0 \u03c3 contoured map confirmed the successful substitution of Ser118 by Ala. (b) Comparison of the native structure (light blue) with that of the mutant protein (magenta). The catalytic triad is shown as sticks. His133 is also shown because of its crucial role in substrate recognition. The missing loop and the oxyanion hole region are also highlighted. The consistent conformations of these parts between the native and the mutant proteins make the mutant structure an appropriate model for enzyme\u2013substrate interaction studies.",
