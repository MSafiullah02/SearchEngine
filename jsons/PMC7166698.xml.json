Claimed benefits of DFM supplementation to dairy cattle include increased dry matter intake (DMI), ruminal total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production and milk yield, and decreased \u03b2\u2010hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and non\u2010esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations post\u2010partum (Nocek & Kautz, 2006; Nocek, Kautz, Leedle, & Block, 2003; Oetzel, Emery, Lautz, & Nocek, 2007; Wohlt, Finkelstein, & Chung, 1991). In calves, DFM supplementation increased DMI, average daily gain (ADG), body weight (BW), feed efficiency, serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations and white blood cell counts (Al\u2010Saiady, 2010; Clymer, Daniels, Smalley, Richeson, & Madere, 2015; Jatkauskas & Vrontniakiene, 2010; Zhang et al., 2016), and decreased diarrhoea, fever and cost of treatments (Magalh\u00e3es et al., 2008). Enzyme supplementation has been reported to increase milk production efficiency, milk protein content, digestibility of acid detergent fibre (ADF), crude protein (CP), dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and starch, and total ruminal VFA production (Beauchemin, Yang, & Rode, 1999; Nozi\u00e8re, Steinberg, Silberberg, & Morgavi, 2014; Rode, Yang, & Beauchemin, 1999; Yang, Beauchemin, & Rode, 2000). Based on these findings, it is suggested that DFM and enzymes can impact health and performance of dairy cattle. However, no studies have evaluated the effect of prepartum DFM and enzyme supplementation of cows on colostrum quality and passive transfer of immunoglobulin to calves. Calves are born agammaglobulinaemic because of the synepitheliochorial placenta, which prevents transfer of immunoglobulin in utero (Akers, 2002). As a result, cattle have evolved to transfer immunoglobulin via colostrum.",

            "text": "There are contrary results with supplementation of DFM to animals. For example, Al\u2010Saiady (2010) reported that bull calves fed probiotics had greater serum IgG concentrations than those on the control. Studies with poultry have also indicated that DFM can increase IgG and IgM concentrations and/or cells responsible for IgA, IgG and IgM production (Lee, Lillehoj, & Siragusa, 2010). However, Marakoudakis et al. (2010) found no impact of DFM on plasma IgA, IgG and IgM concentrations in dairy goats, but immunoglobulin in the mammary secretions was not evaluated. Queszada\u2010Mendoza, Heinrichs, and Jones (2011) found no effect of probiotics on plasma, faecal or salivary IgG concentrations in calves. These differing outcomes suggest that there is potential for DFM to increase IgG content in dairy cattle colostrum, which could impact the health of the calf through more IgG available for absorption, as well as impact the health and production of the cow when fed post\u2010partum.",

Our hypothesis was that feeding DFM alone or in combination with enzymes during the transition period would increase colostral IgG and IgA, DMI pre\u2010 and post\u2010partum, milk production, and serum concentrations and apparent efficiency of absorption of IgG and IgA in the calf.",

There were 12, 11, seven, three and two cows in their second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth lactation respectively. Within each block, cows were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: (i) 0 g/day DFM and enzymes (C); (ii) 45.4 g/day of DFM product (D); and (iii) 45.4 g/day of D plus 18.2 g/day of enzyme product (DE). The DFM (D) contained Enterococcus faecium and Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 1.323 billion cfu/g. The enzyme (E) was a combination of both DFM and enzymes, which contained 0.88 billion cfu/g of E. faecium and S. cerevisiae. The enzyme portion of E contained both amylase and cellulase. The ingredients of D were calcium carbonate, rice hulls, active dry yeast, mineral oil, fructooligosaccharides, dried E. faecium fermentation product, sodium silico aluminate, and natural and artificial flavours. The ingredients of E contained rice hull extract, sodium silico aluminate, dried Trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, dried Bacillus subtilis fermentation extract, dried Aspergillus niger fermentation extract, torula dried yeast, dried E. faecium fermentation product, Yucca schidigera extract, riboflavin, calcium gluconate, nicotinic acid, biotin, pyridoxine hydrochloride, thiamine mononitrate, vitamin B12, citric acid, natural and artificial flavours, and mineral oil. The experimental treatments were being evaluated for combination and for eventual commercial application.",

Nutrient composition of orts indicated that there were similar values and little sorting by treatment. All cows were fed the prepartum TMR prior to calving and then switched to the transition TMR immediately post\u2010partum, which helped them to transition to the post\u2010partum TMR at 2 weeks after calving. All cows were kept in tie stalls with mattresses and bedded with kiln dried sawdust from day \u221221 to 56. Each cow was fed in separate wooden feed tubs (90 \u00d7 90 \u00d7 90 cm). Three days prior to the expected calving date, cows were moved to individual maternity pens (4.3 \u00d7 3.7 m) until parturition and placenta delivery. At all times, the cows had access to automated water bowls (Delaval, Tumba, Sweden).",
