To verify the requisite topical application for an effect on pneumococcal carriage, we administered tetravalent inactivated influenza vaccine as a control (n = 62). LAIV infection led to transiently increased pneumococcal acquisition at day 2 (60.0% and 40.3%, as detected by molecular methods, in LAIV groups and control groups, respectively)14. LAIV also increased S. pneumoniae carriage load in the first 14 days following pneumococcal inoculation14 (Supplementary Fig. 1). We collected a series of nasal microbiopsies and nasal lining fluid throughout the study to assess ongoing cellular and cytokine responses. Participants were grouped into those who did not become colonized following S. pneumoniae challenge (carriage\u2212) and those who did (carriage+), as determined by classical microbiology (Fig. 1a). To investigate whether LAIV-induced immune responses were associated with a predisposition to pneumococcal carriage, we measured the concentrations of 30 cytokines and of proteins, including interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), in nasal lining fluid (Fig. 1b). After multiple-testing correction, we found that at day 0, directly prior to S. pneumoniae inoculation, LAIV significantly increased concentrations of 20 cytokines, including CXCL10 (IP-10), tumor-necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 10 (IL-10), IFN-\u03b3 and IL-15 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1). In contrast, the control group did not show any significant increase in cytokine response at day 0. Following S. pneumoniae inoculation, S. pneumoniae carriage in the absence of LAIV was associated with increased concentration of epidermal growth factor at day 2 and decreased concentration of IL-1RA at day 9 after S. pneumoniae inoculation (compared with that at baseline), neither of which remained significant after multiple-testing correction. No other cytokines, including IL-17A or CCL2, were significantly altered by carriage alone (Fig. 1b).",

In particular, IL-10 was significantly increased in LAIV-vaccinated subjects who did not acquire S. pneumoniae following inoculation (5.8-fold increase), but not in those who became carriers following inoculation (2.0-fold increase). In contrast, CXCL10 was significantly increased in subjects who went on to become carriers (2.4-fold increase), but not in those who remained carriage-negative (1.5-fold increase). Moreover, subjects with increased concentrations of CXCL10 before inoculation displayed higher pneumococcal load following S. pneumoniae inoculation (Fig. 1d). This suggests that differences in the response to influenza virus are associated with secondary susceptibility to S. pneumoniae. To test whether this was specific for LAIV infection, we measured CXCL10 in nasal washes from an independent cohort in which a subset of subjects had an asymptomatic viral upper respiratory tract infection the week before S. pneumoniae inoculation that did not progress to symptomatic infection. These comprised infections with rhinovirus (n = 12), coronavirus (n = 5), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 2) and parainfluenzavirus (n = 1)29. The predominant virus, rhinovirus, was recently shown to associate with increased pneumococcal acquisition and transmission30. In these virus-infected subjects, CXCL10 concentration was increased (Supplementary Fig. 2), and baseline CXCL10 concentration correlated with increased pneumococcal load also in this second cohort (Fig. 1e). Unfortunately, sample sizes were too small to further investigate in depth the effects of infection with the different viruses, which are likely to have divergent consequences. Although the correlation was modest in this validation cohort, suggesting that other host and environmental factors are involved, we identified a biomarker, CXCL10, that was predictive of S. pneumoniae load.",

            "text": "In mouse models, neutrophil recruitment after onset of carriage contributes to control of the bacteria15. We observed pre-existing high numbers of neutrophils in the human nasal lining, and pneumococcal carriage did not lead to significant further recruitment of neutrophils (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). To investigate whether luminal neutrophils were involved in the early control of carriage, we measured concentrations of myeloperoxidase, a marker for neutrophil degranulation31, in nasal washes. Concentrations were increased (2.2-fold) at 2 days after challenge in control carriage+ but not carriage\u2212 individuals (Fig. 2a). This neutrophil activation was impaired in the LAIV group, who displayed high carriage load during early carriage and had increased acquisition compared with that of controls. Together, these findings suggest that neutrophil degranulation is important for the initial control of carriage. To investigate whether neutrophils were also impaired systemically following LAIV, as reported during wild-type influenza infection32, we isolated blood neutrophils before, and at 3 days after, LAIV administration from a subset of subjects. We confirmed that opsonophagocytic killing (OPK) of S. pneumoniae by blood neutrophils was decreased following LAIV (Fig. 2b). This effect could be mimicked by the addition of TNF, but not CXCL10, to neutrophils from healthy donors in vitro, decreasing killing capacity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2c,d). NanoString expression analysis of 594 genes revealed ten differentially expressed genes in blood neutrophils 3 days post-LAIV (Supplementary Table 2). Among those were the genes encoding MAP4K2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 2; 3.2-fold increase), which acts on the TNF signal-transduction pathway33, and the co-inhibitory receptor TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains; 3.6-fold increase; Fig. 2e). TIGIT expression levels were also negatively correlated with neutrophil killing capacity (r = \u22120.73; Fig. 2f). TIGIT is an immunological checkpoint protein that has been described to promote regulatory T cell function34, but its expression on neutrophils has not been previously appreciated, to our knowledge. Incubation of whole blood with recombinant TNF increased TIGIT levels on neutrophil surfaces within 30 min in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2g).",

Monocyte numbers increased as early as 2 days following S. pneumoniae inoculation, peaked at 9 days (median 4.8\u00d7 increase) and remained elevated 29 days after S. pneumoniae inoculation. In contrast, there was no recruitment of CD3+ T cells to the nose (Supplementary Fig. 4b). LAIV infection prior to pneumococcal carriage impaired the recruitment of monocytes to the nose (Fig. 3a). Moreover, peak pneumococcal load was associated with increased monocyte recruitment in the control group, but not in the LAIV group (Fig. 3b,c). Indeed, for subjects in the control group with very low carriage densities, which were detectable only by molecular methods, no monocyte recruitment was observed (Supplementary Fig. 4c). This suggests that a minimum S. pneumoniae load is required for sensing and monocyte recruitment and that LAIV infection interferes with this process. Although CCL2 (MCP-1) was not substantially induced following S. pneumoniae carriage, its concentration was correlated with numbers of monocytes at all time points (Supplementary Fig. 5a). Furthermore, stratification of individuals showed that those with increased CCL2 concentration at day 2 after S. pneumoniae inoculation exhibited increased monocyte recruitment (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Concentrations of IL-6, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF were also correlated with numbers of monocytes at each time point, but stratification of individuals did not reveal differential recruitment of monocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5a,b). In a second, independent cohort that did not receive any vaccine, monocytes were increased at day 9 following S. pneumoniae inoculation, which was correlated with an increased CCL2 concentration in nasal fluid, validating these results (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 5c).",

To test whether monocytes/macrophages were the source of these cytokines, we compared the cytokine signature from whole nasal cells with that from alveolar macrophages exposed to S. pneumoniae in vitro (Fig. 4c). Relative cytokine production was highly correlated between the two cell populations, suggesting that nasal monocytes/macrophages could be the source of these cytokines.

Moreover, TLR4 signaling was also enriched in this group. The pneumococcal protein pneumolysin is sensed by TLR436, and it is possible that the increased pneumococcal load following LAIV vaccination led to increased pneumolysin sensing.

ST3GAL4 encodes a sialyl transferase, and cleavage of sialic acids by the influenza neuraminidase has previously been shown to promote pneumococcal growth38.

Numbers of monocytes were correlated with the average fold change count in this module, suggesting that these genes reflect the infiltration of monocytes (Fig. 6b). To further investigate these monocytes, we performed gene set enrichment analysis on the module M1 genes using a list of genes from distinct monocyte subsets (Fig. 6c)40. These genes were enriched for classical CD14+CD16\u2013 monocytes and not for other monocyte subsets.

Expression of the gene encoding the chemokine CXCL6 and that of the gene encoding its receptor CXCR2 were identified as hubs in module M1 (Fig. 6e and Supplementary Data 1). CXCR2 engagement has been shown to induce attachment of monocytes to the endothelial layer, initiating chemotaxis, which suggests this interaction could contribute to monocyte recruitment42.

LAIV infection impaired these immune responses following carriage. LAIV is an attenuated influenza strain, and wild-type influenza viruses might have even more pronounced effects on the host response to pneumococcus. Carriage in the absence of LAIV was associated with only limited inflammation, corroborating the view of S. pneumoniae as a commensal bacterium that can asymptomatically colonize healthy adults43. In contrast, robust proinflammatory cytokine responses were measured following LAIV at both the protein- and gene-expression level.

Key eligibility criteria included capacity to give informed consent, no immunocompromised state or contact with susceptible individuals, no pneumococcal or influenza vaccine or infection in the last 2 years and not having taken part in EHPC studies in the past 3 years. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of pneumococcal colonization as determined by the presence of pneumococcus in nasal wash samples at any time point post-inoculation up to and including day 29, detected using classical microbiology or lytA quantitative PCR as previously described6,51,53. In this study, 130 volunteers were inoculated with pneumococcus, giving an 80% power to identify a 50% increase in carriage acquisition. Of 130 vaccinated volunteers, 5 were natural pneumococcal carriers (2 in the LAIV arm and 3 in the control arm) and were excluded from further analysis. Another 8 subjects in the LAIV arm were excluded following a systematic LAIV dispensing error by a single practitioner, as recommended by the trial steering group. This resulted in final totals of 55 subjects analyzed in the LAIV arm and 62 subjects in the control arm. Key secondary endpoints included the load of pneumococcal colonization in nasal wash samples at each time point following pneumococcal inoculation (days 2, 7, 9, 14, 22 and 29), detected using classical microbiology; the area under the curve of pneumococcal colonization load following pneumococcal inoculation (days 2, 7, 9, 14, 22 and 29), detected using classical microbiology or by molecular methods (lytA); and the immunological mechanisms associated with altered susceptibility to pneumococcus following LAIV.
