This loss of versatility may be most keenly felt by those who have to confront emergent infections and need laboratory support for the clinical and public health measures that must quickly be taken to deal with epidemic disease. In the past, it was rapidly possible to diagnose HIV infection once that virus had been discovered and then, successively and promptly, to diagnose SARS and the Middle East coronaviruses, influenza A H5N1 and Ebola viruses. But will, for instance, a new epidemic strain of influenza now be recognised as quickly or the extent of any other emergent infection be determined with the same responsiveness? These unforeseen challenges often have logistical, cultural, ethical and safety as well as technical aspects, and they require rapid, workable solutions. They make demands that \"Big Diagnostics\" may not meet in a sufficiently timely fashion.",

The joint clinical and public health response to the epidemic has required polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays, and as fast track vaccine development proceeds, it will need the development of serological tests. To evaluate candidate Ebola vaccines, regional laboratory diagnostic services will have to be maintained even as the epidemic subsides.",

These excellent interventions have been funded by partnerships between international charities and governmental and other donors, and have been based on the know-how of a few First World laboratories. Commercial diagnostics have so far only played a small part, though innovative start-up laboratories may increasingly do so in the future.",

The recent announcement by its manufacturer of a low-tech Ebola antigen test, even one less accurate than PCR, points the way towards a more convenient laboratory diagnostic and so a quicker outbreak control in the future. An antigen test will be less sensitive than PCR and may imply a day or two's delay in diagnosis; but a point-of-care test that is better adapted to local conditions may prove the adage that the perfect (i.e. PCR) can sometimes be the enemy of the good.",

In these circumstances, might more readily collected urine samples substitute for venous blood? Urinary viral diagnostics have so far only attracted intermittent attention, but urine samples can be self-collected, and procedures as sensitive as PCR can then be applied to them. In November 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted a method for the PCR detection of Ebola sequences applicable to urine samples [1].",

Few of these publications give a definitive indication of clinical sensitivity, but they suggest that urine-based diagnostics might be useful in otherwise difficult circumstances even if not as immediately accurate as a blood sample. Given the general high sensitivity of nucleic acid amplification procedures, a urine-based PCR might be expected to detect those viruses like mumps, CMV and polyoma that are readily isolated from urine in cell culture as well as other, blood-borne infections. It could be of value in signalling high viraemia and so in determining infection control procedures e.g. in Ebola and other currently emergent infections [2] .",

In an age of black box automation and laboratory machine minding, it is particularly important not to allow the diagnostic laboratory response to emergent infections to become dependent on, and so have to wait for, the appearance of a substantially profitable commercial opportunity. Emerging infections in the Developing World context need not-for-profit involvement and the maintenance of the skills that will support rapid ad hoc diagnostics. These skills should therefore remain part of technical training and be nurtured, and the innovatory spirit associated with them should not be allowed to wither.",
