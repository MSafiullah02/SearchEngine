            "text": "Importance: A surge in severe cases of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) in children would present unique challenges for hospitals and public health preparedness efforts in the United States. Objective: To provide evidence-based estimates of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and projected cumulative numbers of severely ill pediatric COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization during the US 2020 pandemic. Design: Empirical case projection study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Adjusted pediatric severity proportions and adjusted pediatric criticality proportions were derived from clinical and spatiotemporal modeling studies of the COVID-19 epidemic in China for the period January-February 2020. Estimates of total children infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the United States through April 6, 2020, were calculated using US pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) cases and the adjusted pediatric criticality proportion. Projected numbers of severely and critically ill children with COVID-19 were derived by applying the adjusted severity and criticality proportions to US population data, under several scenarios of cumulative pediatric infection proportion (CPIP). Results: By April 6, 2020, there were 74 children who had been reported admitted to PICUs in 19 states, reflecting an estimated 176 190 children nationwide infected with SARS-CoV-2 (52 381 infants and toddlers younger than 2 years, 42 857 children aged 2-11 years, and 80 952 children aged 12-17 years). Under a CPIP scenario of 5%, there would be 3.7 million children infected with SARS-CoV-2, 9907 severely ill children requiring hospitalization, and 1086 critically ill children requiring PICU admission. Under a CPIP scenario of 50%, 10 865 children would require PICU admission, 99 073 would require hospitalization for severe pneumonia, and 37.0 million would be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions and Relevance: Because there are 74.0 million children 0 to 17 years old in the United States, the projected numbers of severe cases could overextend available pediatric hospital care resources under several moderate CPIP scenarios for 2020 despite lower severity of COVID-19 in children than in adults.",

[7] [8] [9] [10] [11] One of the earliest cases of COVID-19 in central Wuhan, China, was a previously healthy 3-year-old child who was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in early January 2020 with ground glass opacities in both lungs, treated with pooled immunoglobulin, and discharged home after a hospital stay of 13 days. 7 A case series of 171 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 pediatric patients who were tested and hospitalized at Wuhan Children's Hospital between January 28 and February 26 included 3 children who required intensive care, one of whom subsequently died 4 weeks after admission. 8 In the largest (n = 2143) study of severity of COVID-19 in identified cases among children, Dong et al 9 reported that infants were at highest risk of becoming severely or critically ill (10.6% of all infant cases), with severely ill characterized by pneumonia and central cyanosis (8.7% of infant cases) and critically ill defined as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation (1.8% of infant cases). The proportion of cases that became severely or critically ill was 7.3% for those aged 1 to 5 years and 4.2% for those aged 6 to 15 years. There was 1 recorded fatality of a 14-year-old boy in Hubei Province. 9 In China, strong mandatory quarantines and infection control efforts were effective in stopping the increase in incidence of pediatric COVID-19 cases by March 2020. 9 Modeling studies predict that transmission chains can be interrupted with sustained social interventions. 12, 13 However, in geopolitical situations where widespread population infection has not been contained, community spread will include infections among the young. Despite a low probability of severe pediatric illness, the sizeable population of children in the United States could result in large numbers of children requiring acute or critical hospital care.",

These severity proportions are likely to be overestimates of the true proportion of severe illness for 2 reasons. First, the case definition included both laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (n = 731) and suspected COVID-19 (n = 1412). For all ages combined, the severity proportion was 5.8% for all cases, but only 2.9% when restricted to confirmed cases. To be conservative, we restricted our subsequent derivation of severity and criticality proportions to laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 cases.",

Therefore, we adjusted the rates of severe or critical illness reported by Dong et al 9 to account for the large number of undetected cases present in the population at risk. An important assumption was that testing of children in China was not only limited but also highly selective-meaning that children with more symptoms were more likely to be tested. Therefore, we conservatively assumed that ALL of the undetected cases were asymptomatic, mild, or moderate cases.",

All state health departments and the CDC should begin reporting confirmed COVID-19 cases in age-specific tables, using the standard 5-year age groups for health surveillance. These data should be publicly available and updated daily. The Florida Department of Health COVID-19 Dashboard is one of several exemplary models, with detailed demographic data provided for cases at both the state and county levels. 38 which reported that among 147 children known to be hospitalized with COVID-19, 10.2% (n = 15) were admitted to a PICU. This CDC report relied on case reporting from state health departments and did not include data from the VPS PICU dashboard. 11 It is possible that the conservative criticality proportions we derived from the Chinese empirical data are an underestimate of the true pediatric criticality proportion experienced in China. This is due to the fact that we excluded all cases of pediatric COVID-19 that were clinically diagnosed but not confirmed by laboratory testing in the Dong et al 9 study. To the extent that any of those suspected cases were true cases, the criticality proportion estimates used in our study are underestimates.",

These patient counts only encompass participating hospitals; the number of participating facilities increased from 140 on March 18 to 166 on April 6.The estimated numbers of children in the United States infected with SARS-CoV-2 are shown inFigure 2. Our analyses predict 2381 children in the community infected with SARS-CoV-2 for each single child who is admitted to the PICU, based on the adjusted pediatric criticality rate of 0.00042. The estimated number of infants and toddlers younger than 2 years who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 increased over the course of 19 days from 2381 on March 18 to 52 381 on April 6. Overall, there were an estimated 176 190 children aged 0 to 17 years infected with SARS-CoV-2 by April 6.The projected cumulative numbers of severely and critically ill infants and children with COVID-19, for scenarios of CPIP ranging from 0.5% (1 out of every 200 children) infected to 60% (3 out of every 5 children) infected, are shown in theTable and Figure 3. Under the lowest CPIP considered (that 1 in 200 children will become infected with SARS-CoV-2 nationwide), 991 children would become severely ill and require hospitalization. Of those, 109 would become critically ill and require PICU care. Under the highest CPIP scenario considered (3 out of 5 children infected nationwide), 118 887 children would become severely ill and 13 038 of those would become critically ill.",

As of April 6, 2020, there were an estimated 176 190 SARS-CoV-2-infected children nationwide. One well-regarded epidemic modeling study found that population infection rates could rise as high as 80% in the United States in the absence of effective and persistent nationwide infection control measures (eg, school, retail, and restaurant closures, event cancellations, and stay-at-home orders).13 \u25a0 Under the highest CPIP scenario included in our study (60%), we projected that 118 887 children would require hospitalization with severe COVID-19, and 13 038 of those hospitalized children would become critically ill and require PICU admission.",
