DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene on the X chromosome. Carriers of the disease are identified by the detection of duplicated or deleted exons in the gene (72) (73) (74) . The deletions/duplications associated with DMD tend to be located at certain regions of the gene, making the diagnosis of DMD (and the related, less severe Becker muscular dystrophy) a straightforward process involving analysis of a limited number of PCR-amplified DNA fragments (72) (73) (74) . An integrated microdevice for infrared-mediated PCR amplifications directly coupled to microchip CE DNA separations was developed for this purpose. In this approach, infrared radiation directly heats the PCR mixture rather than heating the microchip (72 ), allowing fast temperature cycling and shorter analysis time. Unfortunately, separation efficiency was hampered by heating of the microchip sieving matrix buffer solution during PCR cycling. Because heating is integral to PCR, this problem must be solved before this approach can become useful. Nevertheless, PCR-CE provided considerable savings in time, labor, and materials compared with traditional methods (e.g., Southern blot). Solution of the heating problem could make feasible a fully integrated diagnostic device for genetic diseases based on microchip CE. Ertl et al. (75 ) developed a sheath-flow supported electrochemical detection system for microchip CE analysis of an allele-specific, PCR-based single-nucleotide polymorphism typing assay and demonstrated the application of the system for diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis by detection of the C282Y polymorphism. The sheath-flow design minimized interferences of the detection system from electrophoresis potentials. Unlike optical detection systems, the electrochemical detector is easier to miniaturize because bulky optical components (i.e., light source, lens, and filters) are not required. The use of multiple electrodes may make this system a portable micro total-analysis system for analyzing complex analyte mixtures. A semiautomated sample preparation, amplification, and electrophoretic separation platform has also been developed for analysis of human genomic DNA to detect hereditary and infectious diseases based on microchannel CE with 2-color optical detection (excitation wavelengths at 488 and 532 nm). Two-base pair resolution of single-stranded DNA was achieved in the analysis of PCR products from leukocyte lysates (76 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 106, "end": 110, "text": "(72)", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 111, "end": 115, "text": "(73)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 116, "end": 120, "text": "(74)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 141, "end": 146, "text": "(75 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 178, "end": 183, "text": "(76 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 356, "end": 360, "text": "(72)", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 361, "end": 365, "text": "(73)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 366, "end": 370, "text": "(74)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 652, "end": 656, "text": "(72)", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 657, "end": 661, "text": "(73)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 662, "end": 666, "text": "(74)", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1508, "text": "Ertl et al.

The most commonly available features of conventional and microchip Table 2 . Microchip CE has some disadvantages compared with conventional CE, such as lower peak capacity because of the shorter separation channels and a lack of compatibility with versatile ultraviolet detectors because microchip fabrication materials are typically not transparent to ultraviolet light. Important advantages of microchip CE, however, include rapid analysis (typically \u03f310 times faster) and easy integration of sample preparation and derivatization steps, which allow further reduction of analysis time and labor costs.

At the same time, many on-column preconcentration methods have been developed to improve detection sensitivity in CE separations that are readily transferable to the microchip CE format (79, 80 ) . With the introduction of highly automated, high-throughput commercial instrumentation, microchip CE is likely to replace many of the complex and slower analytical systems used in routine analyses.
