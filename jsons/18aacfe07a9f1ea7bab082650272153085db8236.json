Pressing relevance stems from the need to restart the economy dramatically affected by the lockdown. We employ a spatially explicit, data-intensive model of the patterns of disease spread in Italy, with the goal of providing tools to: estimate the baseline trajectory, i.e. the expected unfolding of the outbreak if the current containment measures were kept in place indefinitely; assess possible deviations from the baseline, should relaxations of the current lockdown result in increased disease transmission; and estimate the isolation effort required to prevent a resurgence of the outbreak. For instance, a 50% increase in effective transmission as a result of the loosening of confinement measures, to be instated on May 4, yields an epidemic curve that shows a major rebound larger than the previous peaks in most regions. A control effort, capable of isolating a daily percentage of approximately 7% of the individuals in the exposed and pre-symptomatic stages, proves necessary to counterbalance such an increase, and maintain the epidemic curve onto the decreasing baseline trajectory. We explore several scenarios, provide the basic data to design the related control strategies and discuss their feasibility. Should suitable control via tracing and testing prove unfeasible, stop-and-go enforcement or delay of the lockdown relaxations would be necessary to reduce the isolation effort required to maintain the epidemic trajectory under control.",

Thus, the force of infection of each community depends not only on the local epidemiological variables, but also on the epidemiological variables of the connected communities. Infections, therefore, not only do occur within each community, but can also be imported or exported. In addition, the model accounts for infections occurring because individuals of different communities meet in a third location, because e.g. they work or study in the same place. The relative balance of the fluxes among the various compartments is regulated by process parameters that are estimated in a Bayesian framework using reconstructed data about the number of daily hospitalized cases in all Italian provinces from February 24 to April 24. All relevant technical details are provided as Supplementary Material (SM).",

For example, one must account for the fact that only some activities are announced to be allowed. In addition, acquired awareness may have different lasting effects on social behaviour regardless of imposed measures, and the use of PPE may change through time. Here, we propose to assess the actual increase in overall transmission by tracking the departure of the epidemic curve from the one projected by using the transmission rate achieved during the lockdown (the baseline scenario, blue curve in figure 1 ) . We estimate that an effective increase of 10 % of transmission, stemming from different combinations of the above factors, is expected to yield a less pronounced decline of the daily new hospitalization cases in most regions (figure 1). A 20 % increase would instead determine a rebound of the epidemic in all regions but Lombardia. This regional differential response depends on the current level of transmission and, marginally, on the differential prevalence of the susceptible population, which is lower in the regions that were more severely hit by the first phase of the outbreak.",

Matching the right scenario in real time may be achieved by data assimilation and ensemble Kalman filtering. 6 Control may consist in either re-tightening of the containment measures, possibly of the stop-and-go type, 2 or alternative interventions. While the strategy adopted during the first phase of the outbreak mostly relied on the isolation and treatment of symptomatic cases, a different mix of interventions is possible and desirable. A keystone of such a mix should be an increased isolation effort through tracing, and possibly testing, 7 individuals who have been in close contact with a known infection, 8, 9 possibly with the help of technological advances like tracing apps. 6 Clinical and epidemiological evidence suggests that viral shedding peaks at the end of the latent period, and that shedding rapidly declines after the symptoms' onset or the evolution towards an asymptomatic case. 10 Moreover, viral shedding is similar regardless of the emergence of symptoms in the disease course of a patient. 3 This evidence suggests that isolation is much more effective if targeted at individuals in a latent stage (exposed, , and pre-symptomatic, , compartments of the model, 4 see SM). We therefore focus on these individuals and estimate the percentage and the corresponding number of individuals that should be isolated daily (figure 2), to counterbalance the increase in transmission due to loosening the containment measures, thus maintaining the epidemic curve in the decreasing trajectory achieved during the lockdown (blue lines in figure 1 ).",

As an example, in Lombardia an increase in transmission of 50 % would quickly lead to a ramping epidemic curve (SM). However, daily isolation of about \u223c 1800 out of \u223c 26 000 (\u223c 7 %) exposed and pre-symptomatic individuals would effectively counterbalance the increase in transmission and bring back the curve to the baseline. The estimated number of latent individuals that needs to be isolated every day is of the same order of magnitude of the daily new symptomatic cases that are likely to self-report to the health structures (\u223c 1031). Therefore, the isolation effort should prioritize all the close contacts that the daily new symptomatic cases have had in the previous two days (i.e. the peak of viral shedding 10 ). As infected individuals might not immediately test positive, and because obtaining test results takes time, this strategy might imply to precautionary isolate, at least temporarily, all close contacts. The percentage of these contacts that are actually infected, and thus contribute to reaching the required isolation target, depends on the secondary attack rate. The latter needs to be carefully evaluated depending on the context where the contacts occurred, and on the new conditions upon the relaxation of the confinement measures with increased people awareness and the use of PPE. Should targeting all primary contacts of all new daily symptomatic cases prove insufficient to reach the required target number, secondary contacts would also need to be targeted. In this case, testing primary contacts would help identifying actually infected cases, thus refining the tracing of secondary contacts. 7 If the isolation target proves impossible to achieve for the limits of resources and/or logistical reasons, a possible strategy may consist in delaying the relaxation of the confinement measures. To that end, we note that delaying by an additional month the release of containment measures would more than halve the abundance of exposed and pre-symptomatic individuals, thus proportionally reducing the number of individuals who need to be isolated (results shown as SM).",

These two values bracket the available estimates of IFR for western countries. 11 While the daily percentage of latent individuals that must be isolated in the two cases is similar, the abundance of exposed and pre-symptomatic individuals in the latter scenario is more than twofold, and so is the isolation target in terms of the number of individuals (SM).

However, costs are hard to put a price tag on, because they depend on the macroscopic effects of the relaxations measures, stemming from their real-life application in terms of PPE adoption, social distancing, potential and realized mobility patterns, evolution of alertness about precautionary measures. Because proper choices of cost/benefit ratios are necessary to decide key health policy actions, epidemiological scenarios are necessary to provide at any time a reasoned estimate of the actual number of local infections based on the modelling scenario that best fits the early signs of local revamping of the epidemic. To that end, monitoring on a daily basis the number of new hospitalizations is essential to assimilate data with suitable spatial granularity. Interventions include the reinstatement of human mobility while enforcing the strict adoption of precautions and hygiene measures.
