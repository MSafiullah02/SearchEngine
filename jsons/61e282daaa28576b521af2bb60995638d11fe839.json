Several studies have reported that PRV can cross the specie barrier and induce human encephalitis, but a definitive diagnosis of human PRV encephalitis is debatable due to the lack of PRV DNA detection. Here, we report a case of human PRV encephalitis diagnosed by the next-generation sequencing (NGS) of PRV sequences in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a patient. A male pork vendor developed fever and seizures for 6 days. NGS results showed PRV sequences in his CSF and blood. Sanger sequencing showed that PRV DNA in the CSF and PRV antibodies in both the CSF and blood were positive. MRI results revealed multiple inflammatory lesions in the bilateral hemisphere. Based on the clinical and laboratory data, we diagnosed the patient with PRV encephalitis. This case suggests that PRV can infect humans, causing severe viral encephalitis. People at risk of PRV infection should improve their self-protection awareness.",

CSF analyses showed slight increases in leukocyte counts (6-14 cells/mm 3 ), protein levels (0.18-0.41 g/ L) and glucose levels (4.8-6.39 mmol/L) in all four patients. Cranial MRI of one patient showed a high T2-weighted value widely distributed in the bilateral areas of the temporal lobe, insula, cingulate gyrus, basal ganglia, thalamus, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, and midbrain. Cranial MRI of another patient showed a high T2-weighted value in the bilateral temporal lobe and bilateral basal ganglia.

All the patients received antiviral (acyclovir) and corticosteroid therapy (dexamethasone or methylprednisolone). Three patients remained unconscious 3 to 4 months after treatment, and one patient died. One patient regained consciousness but was blind at the 1-year follow-up.

            "text": "In 2019, Yang H N et al. reported a human case of PRV encephalitis in China (Yang et al., 2019) . The 43year-old patient presented with high-grade fever 4 days after his hands were cut by a knife when dissecting dead swine. He successively developed headache, seizures, and coma within 3 days. Plain CT brain imaging showed hypodensity in the left limbic lobe and bilateral region of the basal ganglia and bilateral occipital lobe. PRV nucleic acid sequences were detected with NGS, and PRV gB and gE antibodies were positive in the CSF, confirming PRV encephalitis. The patient received antiviral therapy (acyclovir, 10 mg/kg/8 h) for 2 weeks and another therapeutic intervention in the ICU and was weaned off mechanical ventilation after a month. In our case study, the patient was a pork vendor in Meng Cheng County of Anhui Province. His hands directly contacted pork and pork products and his fingers had often been cut in the course of his daily work. He presented with fever, seizures, and coma within 1 day. The CSF analysis showed slightly elevated white blood cell counts, no autoimmune encephalitis antibodies, negative gram-stains, and a negative bacterial culture. It is reported that generalized moderate-amplitude theta (4-7 Hz) or delta (1-3 Hz) frequency waves in EEG result are often seen in drowsiness of a normal adult (St. Louis et al., 2016) . EEG was conducted when the patient had been in antiepileptic drug therapy, which may explain the EEG result of the patient. Cranial MRI showed high T2-weighted values in the frontal lobe, temporal lobe, limbic system, basal ganglia, and thalamus. NGS and antibody tests of the blood and CSF confirmed PRV infection of the central nervous system. According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines, acyclovir, with an Alevel strength, is recommended for the empirical treatment of suspected encephalitis and corticosteroids are weakly recommended for the treatment of encephalitis in the absence of good-quality evidence (Tyler, 2018) . In this case, we initiated the empirical antiviral treatment with ganciclovir. After diagnosis of PRVencephalitis, according to IDSA guidelines and treatment regimen in four PRV encephalitis cases reported by Zhao WL et al., we changed the treatment to acyclovir for 14 days and dexamethasone for 4 days. The clinic characteristics of the patient, including a history of exposure to pork; signs of fever, seizures, and loss of consciousness; a typical CSF profile of viral encephalitis; and MRI findings, were consistent with those in the five PRV encephalitis cases previously reported.",

NGS is a powerful platform to amplify and sequence total DNA from a single sample without any probes or primers, so it can unbiasedly identify all the potential pathogens in a single assay (Guan et al., 2015) . NGS has revolutionized the diagnosis of infectious diseases, especially diseases caused by rare or newly discovered pathogens. In our case, PRV sequences were detected in the CSF within 2 days. Although the PRV coverage was relatively low, the mapped reads were distributed uniformly in the whole PRV genome. Based on the clinical characteristics and NGS results, we cautiously suspected that the encephalitis was caused by PRV infection. Considering that PRV encephalitis is rare, a PRV antibody test was conducted, and the positive results in the CSF and blood confirmed the diagnosis.",
