Based on figures from countries such as Korea, Australia and New Zealand that do extensive testing, the mortality rate of COVID-19 is nonetheless less than 2%, and this is likely to be lower due to the many more undiagnosed COVID-19 cases worldwide. Cancer, on the other hand, remains one of the leading causes of death, and a number of recent publications with the European Journal of Surgical Oncology have rightly highlighted the impact of COVID-19 on cancer care and treatment (e.g. Restivo and colleagues) (1).",

Screening for colorectal, breast and cervical cancers is widely advocated in many countries. Shockingly, countries such as the United Kingdom (UK) and Australia have literally shut down their cancer screening programs during this pandemic (2) . With the UK having one of the most successful cancer screening programs worldwide with high rates of the eligible population undergoing bowel, cervical and breast cancer screening, it has been reported that over 2,200 new cancer cases in the UK could be missed each week (2) . Apart from people in UK, millions worldwide would also have been asked to defer or have deferred undergoing screening. Moreover, normalcy is unlikely to return in the next three to six months, and people will likely remain hesitant to undergo cancer screening even after the pandemic.",
