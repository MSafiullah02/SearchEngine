In order to investigate these taxonomic relationships, we sequenced the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA gene of Pfiesteria piscicida (Steidinger et Burkholder), a Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellate, Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp., and Amyloodinium ocellatum (Brown) and submitted those sequences to GenBank. Pfiesteria piscicida and Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp. are heterotrophic dinoflagellates, purportedly pathogenic to fish, and A. ocellatum, a major fish pathogen, has caused extensive economic losses in both the aquarium and aquaculture industries. The pathogenicity of the Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellate is unknown at this time, but its growth characteristics and in vitro food preferences are similar to those of P. piscicda. The SSU sequences of these species were aligned with the other full-length dinoflagellate sequences, as well as those of representative apicomplexans and Perkinsus species, the groups most closely related to dinoflagellates. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Cryptoperidiniopsoid sp., P. piscicida, and the Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellate are closely related and group into the class Blastodiniphyceae, as does A. ocellatum. None of the species examined were closely re-1 . 3 This new species is being described by K.

Pfiesteria piscicida feeds heterotrophically on microalgae and is reportedly nontoxic unless it is exposed to unknown chemical cues associated with live fish Glasgow 1997, Noga 1998) . Once stimulated, Pfiesteria has been shown to kill fish and invertebrates in the laboratory (Smith et al. 1988 , Burkholder et al. 1992 . Currently, there is no evidence that P. piscicida functions as a parasite with prolonged attachment to healthy fish (Noga et al. 1993) , as is the case with A. ocellatum (Lom and Lawler 1973) . Instead, fish mortality is attributed to the release of potent ichthyotoxins (Smith et al. 1988 , Burkholder et al. 1995a .",

The cell debris could, therefore, be removed by gently swirling the 24-well plate and pipetting off the supernatant. New medium was added and the procedure was repeated several times until the tomonts were clean. The isolated tomonts sporulated and began releasing dinospores 3 days later. The dinospores were collected by gently removing the supernatant and concentrating the cells by centrifugation at 500 \u03eb g for 30 min.

            "text": "Strategy for sequencing SSU genes. Dinoflagellate DNA is unlike that of other known taxa, in that 12%-75% of the thymine is replaced by 5-hydroxymethyluracil (Rae 1976, Rae and Steel 1978) . These modified bases are not randomly distributed throughout the genome. There is also evidence from Crypthecodinium cohnii that cytosines in the SSU genes of dinoflagellates are highly methylated, which is unusual for most eukaryotes (Steel and Rae 1980) . These modified bases may be the reason why the amplification of dinoflagellate SSU rDNA with Taq polymerase is sometimes difficult. To overcome this problem, Saunders et al. (1997) found it necessary to amplify the SSU genes of photosynthetic dinoflagellates in 2-4 overlapping segments and then clone and sequence these segments independently. In this study, the multiple segment approach was problematic because the Rhodomonas food source also amplified with the same primers used for the dinoflagellate SSU gene. Therefore, we chose an alternative approach, utilizing SSU RNA transcripts. Briefly, the species were grown on Rhodomonas and allowed to deplete the food cells. The cultures were then filtered, and total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed into cDNA suitable for PCR amplification. The PCR products were then cloned and sequenced.",

            "text": "Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. An ideal data set for phylogenetic reconstruction of any taxonomic group would contain an even distribution of species within the taxonomic group and equal divergence (branch lengths) between all adjacent taxa in the phylogenetic tree. Equal branch lengths reduce the probability of ''long-branch attraction,'' an artifact wherein divergent taxa group together based on long-branch lengths rather than taxonomic affinity. Unfortunately, the existing dinoflagellate SSU data set is still relatively small with a few orders being over-represented and other crucial, ancestral orders being either underrepresented or missing. Further, there are a number of taxa in the available data set that are separated by long branches. This, in part, results from the rapid divergence of modern dinoflagellate groups about 230-260 million years ago (Fensome et al. 1993 ), which has led to a paucity of intermediate species that could help resolve the phylogenetic tree by equalizing branch lengths between taxa. Given these constraints, a maximum-likelihood analysis was chosen over maximum parsimony or distance approaches. The reason is that analyses of data sets, as well as simulation studies, have shown that maximum-likelihood approaches are generally more likely to recover correct phylogenies when branch lengths are unequal (Cunningham et al. 1998) . In this analysis, the PAUP* program was used to estimate which maximum-likelihood model best fits the data (Swafford 1999) . PAUP* is computationally more efficient than previous maximum-likelihood programs and allows for a rigorous statistical analysis of successively more complex maximum-likelihood models.",

An initial equally weighted parsimony analysis was undertaken using PAUP* with the following options in effect: steepest descent off, branches allowed to collapse creating polytomies if maximum branch length \u03ed 0, tree bisection rearrangements in effect, all character states unordered, and 1000 random additions.

The current SSU phylogenetic analysis assigns these species to the Blastodiniales, the only recognized order in the Blastinodiniphyceae (Fensome et al. 1993 ; Table 2 ). Species currently assigned to the Blastodiniales are highly variable, mostly marine, extracellular parasites that generally have a complicated life cycle that includes a sporogenetic stage which culminates in a motile, infective dinospore stage. The life cycle may also include one or more cyst stages (Cachon and Cachon 1987) . The large diversity of species in Blastodiniphyceae suggests that the group may be polyphyletic (Fensome et al. 1993) . Besides parasitism and the presence of specific lifecycle stages, the primary characteristic that allows assignment of a species to the Blastodiniphycidae is the absence of the typical dinokaryon in one or more life-cycle stages. The dinokaryon is a nuclear organization unique to the Dinoflagellates characterized by permanently condensed, banded chromosomes, where only certain loops of DNA extending out from the condensed chromosomes are transcriptionally active (Sigee 1984) . The dinokaryon is considered a derived characteristic relative to the dispersed chromosomes of the more typical eukaryotic nucleus.",

More species need to be examined to determine if the eukaryotic nucleus in one or more of the life-cycle stages is a truly uniform characteristic of the Blastodiniphyceae. Confirming this distinction is particularly important in understanding when species belong to the Blastodiniales or the Phytodiniales (subclass currently unknown). Many Phytodinialian species are morphologically indistinguishable from members of the Blastodiniales and have similarly complex life cycles. The only definitive criterion currently used to distinguish these two groups is that Phytodiniales retain a dinokaryon in all life-cycle stages. This presents a problem in many cases because not all lifecycle stages are known. Hence, when a few known stages only have a dinokaryon, and other stages are missing, taxonomic assignment becomes problematic (Timpano and Pfiester 1985, Buckland-Nicks et al. 1990 ). The SSU sequence data may prove helpful in resolving these taxonomic affiliations because the Phytodiniales, as represented by Gloeodinium viscum, form a separate and more derived group than the Blastodiniales (Figs. 1, 2) . The SSU sequence divergence between the Phytodiniales and Blastodiniales also implies that the morphological similarities between members of these two groups are due to convergent evolution. In addition to taxonomic assignment, sequences from the SSU, and other variable regions within the ribosomal genes, are likely to prove useful in confirming when different life stages belong to the same species.",

The molecular data supports the Gymnodiniphycidae, Peridiniphycidae, and Prorocentrophycidae (GPP) subclass divisions presented in Fensome et al. (1993) with the exception of a relatively small number of species shown in Figure 2 . The order and family distinctions are also reasonably consistent except where noted in Table 2 . Certain genera appear monophyletic (e.g. Alexandrium), whereas others are not (e.g. Gymnodinium; Figs. 1, 2), indicating some genera are more complex than previously assumed. Saunders et al. (1997) found similar support for the GPP subclasss except that they proposed the Gonyaulacales constitute a separate order not within the Peridiniphycidae. This conclusion was based on the fact that all the Perdiniphycidean species fell into a group that was distinctly different from Peridinium sp., the type genus represented in the study. (Fig. 1 , Saunders et al. 1997) . In this analysis, the Gonyaulacales, which form the Peridiniphycidae Group 2, form a distinct group that appear to have diverged later than the other Peridiniphycidae Group 1 (Figs. 1, 2) . The molecular phylogeny therefore supports the contention that the Gonyaulacales are at least a more recently derived group within the Peridiniphycidae, or form a group that diverged from a common ancestor leading to the Gonyaulacales and Prorocentrophycidae (Figs. 1, 2, Table 2 ).",

The early emergence of the Peridiniphycidae is again supported by the the Peridiniphycean-type plate tabulations of the Blastodiniphycidae, the group that diverged just prior to the Peridiniphycidae Group 1 (Landsberg et al. 1994 , Steidinger et al. 1996a .

More Peridinium species are needed to determine if the Peridinum represent their own group or are members of the lineage leading to the Prorocentrum/Gonyualcales (Peridiniphycean group 2; Fig. 1 ). Saunders et al. (1997) proposed that the Sussiales (Symbiodinium group) should not necessarily be placed in the Gymnodiniphycidae. This analysis, instead, shows the Sussiales as a distinct lineage belonging to the Gymnodiniphycidae. It should also be emphasized that the Symbiodinium species, along with A. belauense, and the unidentified symbiotic dinoflagellate, all represent organisms that have formed endosymbiotic relationships with invertebrate hosts. The distinctly different phylogenetic placement of these species is consistent with dino-flagellates undergoing a number of independent symbiotic events throughout evolutionary history.",

The overall SSU phylogeny estimates using maximum-likelihood techniques were largely consistent with the current taxonomies based primarily on plate structure, though exceptions did occur. This indicates that ribosomal gene sequences will be useful in helping to resolve many of the phylogenetic relationships within the dinoflagellates. Species representing intermediate stages in the early evolution of the dinoflagellates, however, will be needed before deep branches in the tree can be adequately resolved. Sequences from variable portions of the ribosomal genes may prove useful not only for phylogenetic studies, but also in identifying life-cycle stages. It should be emphasized that we examined only 54 dinoflagellate species from 14 of the more than 60 known dinoflagellate families and that there is still much to resolve concerning the evolution of the Dinoflagellata.",
