Although levels are highly variable among cows and studies, one study reported that mean colostral concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM were 75 mg/mL, 4.4 mg/mL, and 4.9 mg/mL, respectively [14]. IgG, and IgG1 in particular, are transferred from the bloodstream across the mammary barrier into colostrum by a specific transport mechanism: Receptors on the mammary alveolar epithelial cells capture IgG1 from the extracellular fluid, and the molecule undergoes endocytosis, transport, and finally release into the luminal secretions [13]. The alveolar epithelial cells cease expressing this receptor, most likely in response to increasing prolactin concentrations, at the onset of lactation [15]. Smaller amounts of IgA and IgM are largely derived from local synthesis by plasmacytes in the mammary gland [13]. Although not well understood, colostral transfer of IgE also occurs and may be important in providing early protection against intestinal parasites [16].",

            "text": "Normal bovine colostrum contains greater than 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mL of immunologically active maternal leukocytes, including macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, and neutrophils [13], [17]. At least a portion of colostral leukocytes are absorbed intact across the intestinal barrier [18]. Liebler-Tenorio and colleagues [19] reported that the preferential route of uptake of colostral leukocytes through the intestinal barrier is through the follicle-associated epithelium of Peyer patches in the jejunum and ileum. Reber and colleagues [20] proposed that, after entering the neonatal circulation, maternal leukocytes traffic to neonatal nonlymphoid tissues and secondary lymphoid tissues, disappearing from the neonatal circulation by 24 to 36 hours after feeding colostrum. Although their functional importance in calves is not routinely measured, early evidence suggests that colostral leukocytes enhance lymphocyte response to nonspecific mitogens, increase phagocytosis and bacterial killing ability, and stimulate humoral immune responses (IgG formation) in the calf [17], [21], [22], [23]. Presumably these cells would not be viable in pasteurized colostrum or colostrum replacer products. The role and functional significance of colostral leukocytes remains areas of active research.",

Bioactive components of colostrum with antimicrobial activity include lactoferrin, lysozyme, and lactoperoxidase [24], [25], [26]. Oligosaccharides in colostrum may provide protection against pathogens by acting as competitive inhibitors for the binding sites on the epithelial surfaces of the intestine [27]. Growth factors in bovine colostrum include transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGF-\u03b22), growth hormone (GH), and insulin, but their function in colostrum is not fully understood (see Table 1) [24]. Colostral insulinlike growth factor-I (IGF-I) may be a key regulator in the development of gastrointestinal tracts of bovine neonates, including stimulation of mucosal growth, brush-border enzymes, intestinal DNA synthesis, increased villus size, and glucose uptake increased [28], [29], [30]. Trypsin inhibitor, a compound found in colostrum in concentrations nearly 100 times greater than in milk, serves to protect IgG and other proteins from proteolytic degradation in the intestine of the neonatal calf.",

The total solids content (%) in first milking colostrum and whole milk in Holstein cows has been reported to average 23.9% and 12.9%, respectively (see Table 1) [12]. Much of this increase in colostrum solids content is attributed to a more than fourfold increase in protein content of colostrum versus milk, this being because of significant increases in Ig and casein content [5]. The crude fat content of first milking Holstein colostrum (6.7%) is also significantly higher than for milk (3.6%) [12]. Energy from fat and lactose in colostrum is critical for thermogenesis and body temperature regulation. Certain vitamins and minerals, including calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, iron, cobalt, vitamin A, vitamin E, carotene, riboflavin, vitamin B12, folic acid, choline, and selenium are also found in increased concentrations in bovine colostrum versus milk (see Table 1) [12], [27].",

It is difficult to predict, based on such factors as dam parity, weight of colostrum produced at first milking, or visual consistency, which colostrum collected will be of high (>50 g/L IgG) versus low quality [43]. The colostrometer, a hydrometer instrument that estimates IgG concentration by measuring colostrum specific gravity, is one rapid and inexpensive cow-side test that may be useful to differentiate high- from low-quality colostrum (specific gravity >1.050 approximates IgG concentration >50 g/L IgG). Factors such as content of fat and other solids, plus colostrum temperature, affect the hydrometer reading, however. Pritchett and colleagues [55] reported that the sensitivity and specificity of the instrument for detecting low-quality colostrum were 0.32 and 0.97, respectively, meaning that the instrument would incorrectly classify two of every three low-quality colostrum samples as acceptable. Pritchett and colleagues [55] suggested that to avoid misclassification error, producers should alter the hydrometer cutoff points to 45, 60, or 110 g/L if feeding either 3.78, 2.84, or 1.89 L of colostrum at first feeding, respectively. Test specificity would be severely compromised by using higher cutpoints, however, resulting in an excessive portion of colostrums being misclassified as deficient [3]. Others have suggested that if a large enough volume (eg, 3.78 L) is fed at first feeding, then there may be limited value to using a hydrometer. Despite its limitations, the hydrometer may still be useful to differentiate high- from low-quality colostrum used for first versus later feedings, respectively.",

So what volume of colostrum should producers feed to meet or exceed this minimum dose? Obviously the answer to this question depends on the IgG concentration in the colostrum being fed. For example, if colostrum was known to contain 50 g/L IgG, then the producer would only need to feed 1.89 L (2 qt) to achieve the minimum goal of ingesting more than 100 g IgG. If the colostrum contained only 25 g/L of IgG, however, then the producer would need to feed 3.78 L (4 qt) to achieve the same ingested mass of IgG. Besser and colleagues [57] noted that only 36% of colostrum samples tested would be of high enough quality to provide greater than 100 g IgG if calves were only fed 1.89 L. Some 85% of colostrum samples tested would be of high enough quality to provide greater than 100 g IgG if calves were fed 3.78 L, however. Because producers frequently do not know the concentration of IgG in the colostrum being fed, it is currently recommended that calves be fed 10% to 12% of their body weight of colostrum at first feeding (3.78 L for a 43-kg calf). In one study mean serum IgG at 24 hours was significantly higher for calves fed 4 L of high-quality colostrum at 0 hours and a further 2 L at 12 hours (31.1 mg/mL IgG) as compared with calves fed only 2 L of high-quality colostrum at 0 hours and a further 2 L at 12 hours (23.5 mg/mL) (\nFig. 2) [58]. Another study reported that Brown Swiss calves fed 3.78 L (versus 1.89 L) of colostrum at first feeding experienced significantly higher rates of average daily gain and greater levels of milk production in both the first and second lactation [10]. In national surveys, 26.1%, 35.9%, and 38.2% of producers reported feeding 4 or more quarts of colostrum within the first 24 hours in 1992, 1996, and 2002, respectively [2], [4], [11], indicating that increasing the volume of colostrum fed is still an area of opportunity for most dairy producers.",

High rates of FPT have been reported in calves left to suckle the dam [57], [64]. This finding may be attributable to failure of the calf to voluntarily consume a sufficient volume of colostrum and delays in suckling. Edwards and Broom [65] reported that 46% of calves born to second parity and older cows had failed to suckle within 6 hours after birth. By comparison, 11% of calves born to first-calf heifers had failed to suckle within 6 hours after birth. These delays could be caused by numerous factors, including weak or injured cow or calf, mastitis or other illness in the cow, low pendulous udders or large teats, or poor mothering ability. It is for this reason that it is currently recommended that the calf be removed from the dam within 1 to 2 hours of birth, and that the calf then be hand-fed a known volume of colostrum using either a nipple bottle or esophageal feeder [6]. In national surveys, 68.1%, 70.5%, and 76.2% of calves were reportedly fed using a nipple bottle or esophageal tube in 1992, 1996, and 2002, respectively [2], [4], [11], indicating that progressively fewer producers are relying on suckling the dam for colostrum delivery.",

Although the esophageal feeder method is quicker, it is known that when fluid is given with an esophageal feeder, the esophageal groove reflex is not triggered, resulting in fluid being deposited into the forestomachs. This limitation is not significant, however, because outflow of colostrum from the forestomachs to the abomasum and small intestine occurs for the most part within 3 hours [66]. Adams and colleagues [67] reported that calves fed colostrum using a bottle had only slightly higher serum IgG concentrations versus calves fed with an esophageal feeder, but that these differences were numerically small and statistically insignificant. It is generally accepted that either method of feeding achieves acceptable rates of passive transfer provided a sufficient volume of colostrum is consumed [67], [68].

This improvement was attributed to reduced bacterial interference with IgG absorption across the gut, resulting in higher efficiency of IgG absorption in calves fed pasteurized colostrum (35%) versus calves fed raw colostrum (27%) [77].

Unless colostrum is to be fed right away, it should be frozen or refrigerated within 1 hour after collection. It is generally accepted that colostrum may be frozen for up to 1 year, provided multiple freeze\u2013thaw cycles do not occur. When thawing frozen colostrum, producers should avoid overheating colostrum (avoid temperatures >60\u00b0C or 140\u00b0F) or some denaturation of colostral Ig can occur [82]. Options for producers who wish to store fresh colostrum include refrigeration with or without the use of preservatives such as potassium sorbate [81]. IgG in raw refrigerated colostrum is stable for at least 1 week. Average bacteria counts in raw refrigerated colostrum may reach unacceptably high concentrations (>100,000 cfu/mL) after 2 days of refrigeration, however. By comparison, average colostrum bacteria counts remained less than 100,000 cfu/mL for 6 days of refrigeration when colostrum was preserved with potassium sorbate in a 0.5% final solution [81].

            "text": "An additional tool that may be useful to reduce bacterial contamination of colostrum is pasteurization. Early studies tried to pasteurize colostrum using the same conventional methods and high temperatures as are typically used to pasteurize milk (63\u00b0C [145\u00b0F] for 30 minutes or 72\u00b0C [161\u00b0F] for 15 seconds). This process yielded unacceptable results, however, including thickening or congealing of colostrum and denaturation of approximately one third of colostral IgG [83]. Despite these early setbacks, more recent research has determined that using a lower-temperature, longer-time approach (60\u00b0C [140\u00b0F] for 60 minutes) to batch-pasteurize colostrum is sufficient to maintain IgG activity and colostrum fluid characteristics, while eliminating or significantly reducing important pathogens including E. coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Mycoplasma bovis and Mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis\n[82], [84]. In one recent on-farm controlled study, calves fed pasteurized colostrum (60\u00b0C \u00d7 60 minutes) experienced a significant reduction in colostrum bacterial exposure and significantly higher serum IgG levels at 24 hours of age versus calves fed 3.8 L of raw colostrum [77]. If stored in a clean covered container, the shelf life of pasteurized refrigerated colostrum is at least 8 to 10 days [85]. The potential short- and long-term health and economic benefits of feeding pasteurized colostrum have not yet been described.",

            "text": "Farms can occasionally experience periods in which an adequate supply of clean, high-quality, fresh or stored colostrum is not available to feed to all newborn calves. Contributing to this problem, some producers may discard colostrum from cows that test positive for M avium subsp paratuberculosis, bovine leukosis virus, or M bovis mastitis. Under such circumstances, using colostrum supplements (CS) or colostrum replacement (CR) products may offer producers a convenient way to improve levels of passive immunity in calves while reducing the risk for pathogen exposure through colostrum. Powdered commercial CS or CR products contain bovine Ig that is typically either lacteal- or plasma-derived. It is recommended that CS or CR products be mixed in water (according to label directions) and fed as a separate meal after any natural colostrum has been fed [6]. There are important differences between the less expensive CS products ($5\u2013$7 per dose) and more expensive CR products ($25\u2013$30 per dose). Colostrum supplement products typically contain less than 50 g IgG per dose, contain no nutrient pack, and are only intended to supplement (not replace) existing colostrum. If given alone, feeding CS products results in significantly lower serum Ig and greater risk for FPT in calves as compared with feeding fresh colostrum [86]. There is no added benefit of feeding CS products if already feeding 3 to 4 L of high-quality bovine colostrum [87], [88]. By comparison, CR products contain a minimum of 100 g IgG per dose, provide a nutritional source of protein, energy, vitamins, and minerals, and are designed to completely replace (or feed in the absence of) maternal colostrum [89].",

In a controlled study of 12 dairy herds in Minnesota and Wisconsin, Swan and colleagues [31] reported that 239 commercial dairy calves fed a commercially available CR product (Acquire, American Protein Corporation, Inc., Ames, Iowa) had significantly lower serum IgG concentrations (5.8 mg/mL IgG) than 218 calves fed maternal colostrum (14.8 mg/mL IgG). Although a trend was present, the preweaning morbidity and mortality rates were not different for calves fed CR (morbidity = 59.6%; mortality = 12.4%) versus calves fed maternal colostrum (morbidity = 51.9%; mortality = 10%). Other studies have reported better rates of successful passive transfer (mean serum IgG >10.0 mg/mL), particularly when calves were fed two doses of CR product [89], [92]. In one such study, the average 24-hour serum IgG level for calves fed either one dose (100 g IgG) or two doses (200 g IgG) of a lacteal-derived CR, or 3.78 L of maternal colostrum, were 11.6, 16.9, and 27.2 mg/mL IgG, respectively (Land O' Lakes Colostrum Replacement, Land O' Lakes Inc., St. Paul, Minnesota) [93]. Feeding higher doses of CR products may increase the rate of successful passive transfer, but the cost\u2013benefit of this practice has yet to be described. Similarly, the effectiveness and cost\u2013benefit of routinely using CR products in Johne's or other infectious disease control programs has yet to be described. Because of the highly variable performance among different products, veterinarians should review results of peer-reviewed controlled trials when selecting a CR product.",

            "text": "Measurement of serum total solids (STS) by hand-held refractometer offers a convenient, simple, rapid, and inexpensive on-farm tool by which producers can monitor the colostrum feeding program. The refractometer instrument costs approximately $250 (USD). In an early study of 185 calves, STS had a good correlation with serum IgG concentration as measured using RID (R\n2 = 0.72) [98]. Calloway and colleagues [99], reported that STS concentration test endpoints of 5.0 and 5.2 g/dL yielded the most accurate results in estimating the adequacy of passive transfer as defined by serum IgG 10.0 mg/mL or greater (sensitivity >0.80; specificity >0.80; proportion classified correctly >0.85). In that study lower or higher test endpoints misclassified larger numbers of calves. Because STS results do result in periodic misclassification of individual calves, the use of STS results as an individual animal diagnostic tool is discouraged. When results are interpreted at the group or herd level, however, STS results accurately reflect the proportion of calves that have FPT, thereby making it a useful on-farm tool for monitoring whether the colostrum management program is succeeding. It is recommended that serum samples be collected from a minimum of 12 clinically normal (not scouring) calves between 24 hours and 7 days of age [6]. Wallace and colleagues [100] reported that the results of STS refractometry from centrifuge- and noncentrifuge-harvested sources of serum were highly correlated (R\n2 = 0.95), so producers can conduct this test on-farm without need of a centrifuge. McGuirk and Collins [6] suggest that a goal is for 80% or more of calves tested to meet or exceed a STS cutpoint of 5.5 g/dL. Tyler suggests that 90% or more of calves tested should meet or exceed the more accurate STS cutpoint of 5.0 g/dL (J Tyler, personal communication, 2002). If it is determined that a disproportionate number of calves have FPT, then the veterinarian and producer must investigate to identify and then correct the root causes of FPT within the colostrum management program. In addition to periodically sampling groups of calves to assess FPT, producers can also periodically submit frozen colostrum samples to a microbiology laboratory for culture. A goal is for a majority of samples submitted to have at total bacteria count of less than 100,000 cfu/mL and a total coliform count less than 10,000 cfu/mL [6].",

Unfortunately, a significant proportion of North American dairy calves suffer from failure of passive transfer, contributing to excessively high preweaning mortality. There is considerable opportunity for most dairy producers to improve their colostrum management practices, resulting in improved short- and long-term health and performance of the animal. A successful colostrum management program requires producers to consistently provide calves with a sufficient volume of clean, high-quality colostrum within the first few hours of life. Colostrum replacers are useful tools if a sufficient quantity of clean, high-quality maternal colostrum is not available. Ongoing monitoring helps producers to more quickly identify and correct problems within the colostrum management program.",
