Her husband recovered but she developed severe respiratory illness, perhaps due to her immunocompromised status and introduction of hMPV to the lower respiratory tract as a result of the bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy procedure. Alternatively, acute worsening of respiratory symptoms after bronchoscopy may be attributed to the presence of H influenzae in the bronchoalveolar lavage of this patient. However, this seems unlikely for several reasons. First, H influenzae usually colonizes the respiratory tracts of patients with chronic lung disease and isolation of this organism is not always associated with active disease.16, 17 Second, clinical presentation with septic shock is usually seen in younger patients with splenectomy or functional asplenia.18 Patients with H influenzae septic shock, as with other systemic bacterial infections, typically exhibit leukocytosis, bandemia and positive blood cultures.19 All of the aforementioned risk factors and features were absent in our patient. Third, the isolate was beta-lactamase-negative and sensitive to cefepime. The patient reported here continued to deteriorate clinically despite being on appropriate antibiotic coverage, and improvement occurred only after initiation of a systemic anti-viral agent.",

However, we believe this is less likely because our patient developed a respiratory syndrome with typical culture-negative sepsis syndrome, which only improved after administration of ribavirin. Her initial worsening of respiratory symptoms on inhaled ribavirin was due to the development of bronchospasm usually noted with this route and evidenced by increased peak airway pressure. The patient was started on ribavirin owing to its potential activity against hMPV. Use of intravenous ribavirin was clearly associated with improvement and subsequent recovery of this patient. Although further well-defined studies are required to determine the incidence of hMPV in transplant recipients with acute respiratory illness, and to establish the optimal treatment of hMPV in lung transplant recipients, our case suggests the use of intravenous ribavirin as an option in cases of hMPV pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts.",
