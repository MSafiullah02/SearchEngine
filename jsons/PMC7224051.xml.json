Given that the supportive therapies shown to reduce mortality in ARDS include primarily a ventilator strategy and prone positioning, it may seem implicit that there exists some modifiable mortality attributable to ARDS related to oxygenation [5, 6]. However, for decades, it has been clear that refractory hypoxemia accounts for only a small fraction of deaths in ARDS [7, 8]. A recent study showed the majority of deaths of ICU patients with ARDS were not directly related to lung damage [9]. Thus, it has been challenging to determine what proportion of mortality is attributable to ARDS itself (and therefore a potential target for ARDS-focused clinical trials), and what proportion is driven by the underlying ARDS risk factor, comorbidities, or a combination of the two. Quantifying the ARDS-attributable mortality\u2014the excess mortality among patients with ARDS that can be attributed to ARDS\u2014would help inform design of future ARDS clinical trials.",

In a large retrospective study of ventilated ICU patients, development of early or late ARDS was not associated with an increase in mortality at 28 days [17]. However, severe ARDS was associated with increased mortality at 2 years. These studies have varied tremendously with regard to patient population and controlling for baseline severity of illness. Notably, many studies focused on trauma populations, a subgroup which may not be representative of patients with other ARDS risk factors [18]. The relevance of older studies to current practice is also unclear, given most were performed before the era of low tidal volume ventilation and modern resuscitation practices. Recent studies have not focused on sepsis, the most common ARDS risk factor.",

We additionally identified patients who met the American-European Consensus Conference (AECC) criteria for acute lung injury (ALI) during the same time frame [25].

While it may not be surprising that severe ARDS portends a worse prognosis than moderate or mild disease, the varied ability to detect statistically significant mortality differences based on severity of ARDS is, to our knowledge, a novel finding. Most recently, Fuchs et al. showed no detectable difference in 28-day mortality among ventilated patients with or without ARDS, but did find that severe ARDS served as a risk factor for 2-year mortality [17].

Prognostic enrichment is defined as preferentially targeting enrollment of patients with the highest rates of disease-attributable (and, hopefully, modifiable) outcomes\u2014in this case, mortality. With increasing recognition that current definitions of sepsis and ARDS do not identify patients with uniform and distinct disease processes, and that this heterogeneity may be confounding clinical trials, prognostic enrichment may offer one reasonable approach [30]. While targeting patients with more severe ARDS has had some success [6, 31], this study provides the first empiric evidence to support such a strategy. Our findings suggest that prognostic enrichment focusing on patients with severe ARDS, either as defined by the Berlin definition of P/F < 100, or perhaps by P/F < 120, as suggested by our data-driven comparison of mortality risk, may identify individuals most likely to die from factors related specifically to ARDS, and therefore may provide a population in which we are better able to identify beneficial treatments. This finding is consistent with a prior autopsy study which reported that patients with severe ARDS were more likely to experience refractory hypoxemia prior to death and have diffuse alveolar damage than patients with mild or moderate disease who were more likely to die of refractory shock [32].",

Attributable fraction of mortality is the proportion of deaths that can be statistically attributed to an underlying cause, in this case, ARDS [28]. Population attributable fraction of mortality is the proportion of deaths within a cohort of patients, all of whom are at risk of the underlying cause in question: In this case, the proportion of deaths due to ARDS among all patients with sepsis. The AFARDS was 27% in EARLI and 37% in VALID. The population AFARDS was 16% in EARLI and 18% in VALID. It is helpful to put these results in the context of other studies estimating attributable mortality of important critical care diseases. The attributable fraction of mortality from sepsis was recently estimated at 15% [33]. The population attributable fraction of mortality from ICU-acquired infections and ICU delirium has been estimated at 11% and 7%, respectively [29, 34]. While ARDS may confer mortality fractions notably higher than these other important ICU conditions, any absolute changes in mortality by fully treating or preventing ARDS would still be relatively low. As recently illustrated by Shankar-Hari et al., these data have major implications for considering the size of clinical trials necessary to detect such changes [33].",

The similarity of the association between ARDS and in-hospital mortality in these very different populations strengthens the validity of our findings and suggests generalizability. Second, we found relatively consistent results within each cohort when adjusting for up to three distinct severity of illness metrics. Third, in developing adjusted models, we searched methodically for possible confounders and did not find other contributory variables. Fourth, all patients were meticulously phenotyped for both sepsis and ARDS. Finally, in contrast to most studies assessing ARDS and attributable mortality, this study expands the populations to include both medical and surgical patients, thereby increasing generalizability of results beyond previously published studies.",

            "text": "This study has limitations. First, there were some discrepancies in specific data collected in each cohort. Most notably, we did not have information on code status or admission from a nursing home in the VALID population. However, incorporation of these variables did not significantly affect any of the EARLI models. In addition, we were unable to generate APACHE III scores from the VALID data. To better align the cohorts, we chose to utilize APACHE II for our primary analyses. While we adjusted for multiple confounders, the possibility of residual confounding remains. Specifically, we did not control for measures of other acute organ failures beyond what is captured in APACHE and SAPS scores. As depicted in our DAG, we hypothesize that other acute organ failures may lie on the indirect causal path between ARDS and death, and so were not included in our models. However, if the association between ARDS and mortality is driven predominantly by other organ failures (such as renal or hepatic) that develop later in a patient\u2019s ICU stay, or those variables are instead predominantly confounders, our analysis may not precisely capture that relationship. This caveat is important because some prior studies have identified increased mortality in ARDS with other organ failures or comorbidities [35, 36]. Our study does not explain the cause of the observed higher mortality in patients with severe ARDS, but future studies focusing on severe ARDS should explore this question. Because we began enrollment and data collection for both cohorts before the advent of Sepsis 3, our coding for sepsis reflects the prior definition. However, as we enrolled critically ill patients, it is unlikely that our patients would not fulfill the more recent criteria for sepsis [37]. Finally, as our study focused on patients with sepsis, the most common ARDS risk factor, findings may not be generalizable to patients with other risk factors for ARDS.",

In two separate cohorts of ICU patients with sepsis, ARDS is independently associated with hospital and ICU mortality as well as VFDs, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS. Importantly, patients with the most severe ARDS primarily drove the relationship between ARDS and mortality. These findings suggest that to successfully identify novel therapeutics or changes in practice that may impact mortality, clinical trials for ARDS will require significantly larger study populations or should focus primarily on patients with severe ARDS.",
