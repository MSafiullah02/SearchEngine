Domestic animals often act as reservoir species that can maintain infectious diseases in their populations and periodically transmit these diseases to na\u00efve wildlife populations (Cleaveland & Dye 1995; Rhodes et al. 1998; Lafferty & Gerber 2002). More attention is now being paid to the diseases of domestic dogs that live in areas surrounding protected areas and other regions with significant wildlife populations (e.g., Alexander et al. 1993; Laurenson et al. 1998; Cleaveland et al. 2000). Knowing which diseases are present and their prevalences are not the only important pieces of information; it is also necessary to understand the ecology of the dogs to determine their potential impact on the neighboring wildlife.",

Theoretically, buffer zones are considered areas where only low\u2010impact activities, compatible with protection of the central core of the reserve, occur (Shafer 1999; Smith 2003). In practice, however, buffer zones tend to be used for multiple purposes and are often the site of both sustainable and unsustainable resource exploitation (S\u00e1nchez\u2010Azofeifa et al. 2003). In Bolivia protected areas include national parks and integrated management areas (IMA). The IMAs generally surround parks and may include or be contiguous with indigenous territories (Tierra Comunitaria de Origen, or TCO). Each TCO establishes its own zonation and management plan, defining regulations on resource extraction and land use that respect relevant national legislation.",

Although it does not have legal status that defines it as part of the park buffer zone, for practical purposes it functions as such. About 8000 Isose\u00f1os inhabit 23 communities clustered along the Rio Parapet\u00ed in the TCO and use this 3000\u20134000 km2 region west of the park boundary for subsistence and commercial hunting (Kaa\u2010Iya Project 2001). Dogs are abundant in the communities, and may come into contact with wildlife in or near the communities. In addition, because nearly all hunting activities include dogs (Noss & Cu\u00e9llar 2001; Kaa\u2010Iya Project, unpublished data) and hunters from the communities utilize much of the TCO, the transmission of infectious diseases from the domestic dogs to wildlife is a potential risk. Previous research in Bolivia indicates that many domestic dogs have been exposed to pathogens of conservation concern (Widdowson et al. 2002; Fiorello et al. 2004).",

The disease susceptibility of captive South American carnivore species to domestic dog diseases is known from the literature. For example, heartworm disease has been reported in jaguars and jaguarundis (Otto 1974); canine parvovirus (CPV) has been reported in crab\u2010eating foxes (Mann et al. 1980; Barker & Parrish 2001); and canine distemper has been reported in a jaguar (Appel et al. 1994) and a crab\u2010eating fox (Rego et al. 1997). There is no reason to suppose that these species would not be susceptible in the wild; in fact, sarcoptic mange has been reported in free\u2010ranging pampas foxes in the Isoso (Deem et al. 2002).",

We used a combination of blood sampling, informal discussions with local residents, a questionnaire survey, and a large data set on hunting to study domestic dogs in indigenous communities of southeastern Bolivia. Our specific aims were to determine whether domestic dogs serve as potential reservoirs of disease agents pathogenic to wild carnivores and have regular opportunities to come into contact with wild carnivores or their environment.",

The Kaa\u2010Iya Project employs members of the communities to serve as hunting monitors as part of their mission to manage the natural resources of the area. Data on hunting are collected to monitor harvests of game species, upon which the local people rely for protein. Hunters who volunteer to participate provide their community hunting monitor with information on location, date, time, and duration of each hunt and on weapons used, number of dogs present, the weather, and number and characteristics (age, sex, condition) of each animal harvested. Not all hunters in a given community participate, and those who do participate do not necessarily record complete data from every hunt. Individual communities differ in their level of hunter participation; in some, all hunters participate, whereas in others very few participate (Noss et al. 2003). However, despite these drawbacks, the data set does contain useful information. Based on hunts (n= 140) when researchers from the Kaa\u2010Iya Project accompanied local hunters, we estimated that between 25 and 30% of hunts were successful (Kaa\u2010Iya Project, unpublished data). Therefore, the data collected on successful hunts likely represent about 25% of the total hunting effort by participating hunters in the area.",

Iyobi and Yapiroa, two of the largest communities (Kaa\u2010Iya Project, unpublished data), have a more diverse economy and their inhabitants are less likely than those in small communities to rely on seasonal migratory work and hunting. Residents of Rancho Viejo, an intermediate\u2010sized community, rely heavily on hunting during the months when seasonal agricultural work is unavailable. Situated in the northern part of the Isoso on the east bank of the river, Rancho Viejo and Iyobi are more isolated than Yapiroa. Yapiroa is located farther south, on the west bank of the river, closer to the nearest town and railroad station. Dogs living in Yapiroa might be expected to have more contact with dogs from outside the Isoso because this area is closer to main roads and it is not necessary to cross the river to reach them.",

Antibodies to S. scabiei wane within 2 months of the infection clearing, so when they are found they indicate current or very recent infection (Lower et al. 2001).

Dogs in the Isoso are all owned, and are considered necessary for hunting all terrestrial species except brocket deer (Mazama gouazoupira). We did not collect data on the source of dogs, but informal discussions indicated that most dogs were received or purchased from friends or relatives in the Isoso, with an occasional dog being purchased in nearby cities. There were on average 3.8 adult dogs/household (Table 3) and 4.9 people/household (Kaa\u2010Iya Project, unpublished data). There was roughly one dog for every 1.5 persons.

In the Brazilian Amazon, seropositivity to CDV and CPV was 9% and 13%, respectively, (Courtenay et al. 2001). A study in Ethiopia found 100% seropositivity to CPV in 18 dogs sampled, but seroprevalence of other viruses was lower. For CDV it was approximately 32%, whereas for canine adenovirus it ranged from 0 to 90%, depending on the region (Laurenson et al. 1998).

Other viruses are also relatively common in this population. Although these pathogens may be of less conservation concern than CDV or CPV, they may still represent a risk for wild carnivores (Evermann et al. 2005). First, because exposure to these less prevalent pathogens is not uniform, some dogs are becoming infected during their adulthood, and it is adult dogs that are most likely to encounter wildlife. Second, coinfection with some viruses, including canine coronavirus and canine adenovirus, can cause much more severe disease than single infection (Pratelli et al. 2001, 1999), and it may increase the amount and duration of viral shedding of one or both pathogens (Pratelli et al. 2001). Most dogs had antibodies to more than one disease agent. Although we have no data to demonstrate whether these are sequential or simultaneous infections, it is reasonable to assume that at least some of these dogs had simultaneous infections.",

The finding that antibodies to T. gondii were more common in dogs living near a cattle ranch may reflect their proximity to cats. Domestic cats are rare in the Isoso; however, several cats lived on or around this ranch. Felids are the definitive host for T. gondii, and so the dogs living near the ranch may be more likely to be exposed to infectious cysts shed in cats' feces. Although dogs may become infected from eating wild prey, they are rarely given meat by their owners and do not seem to hunt much on their own. It is also possible that they are being infected by cysts in the feces of wild felids, although this would not explain the higher seroprevalence in dogs near the ranch. Regardless of how they are being exposed, these dogs share an environment with their human caretakers, who are also susceptible to this zoonotic pathogen.",

Because the data we collected for this study were cross\u2010sectional, it is possible that an outbreak was beginning in Yapiroa and will continue to spread to other communities. If additional sampling is done in the future, we may be able to determine whether the pattern of higher exposure in Yapiroa is persisting or whether it represented an epidemic wave that spread through the Isoso.

This is reassuring because those that survive the infection are likely to be immune for several years, and given the short lifespan of most Isose\u00f1o dogs, they are probably immune for life.

First, Isose\u00f1o communities have an abundance of dogs. These dogs are infrequently vaccinated and receive no other preventive health care, an unsurprising finding in a place where people are often unable to obtain adequate health care for themselves and their families. Second, the high mortality of dogs, and especially of puppies, suggests that mortality from disease is playing a large role in regulating the canine population. Owners' descriptions of the clinical signs exhibited by puppies support the conclusion that many of the pups are suffering from infectious diseases.

Other carnivores, especially foxes, are commonly seen using roads, and carnivore scats are deposited along trails, presumably to mark territories. The potential for contact\u2014especially indirect contact\u2014is greatly magnified because of the preference of both domestic and wild carnivores for roads and trails.
