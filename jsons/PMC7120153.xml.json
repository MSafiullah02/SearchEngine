            "text": "\nTurkey coronavirus (TCoV) causes atrophic enteritis in turkeys and belongs to species coronavirus of thegenus Gammacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae. The most closely related coronavirus is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causing respiratory disease in chickens. Turkey coronavirus infection induced protective antibody responses because turkeys that survived the infection did not develop clinical signs and TCoV was not detected in their intestines and feces after subsequent exposure to TCoV [1, 2]. Therefore, serological tests can be used to detect previous exposure to TCoV and differentiate the serotypes or strains from different isolates. The TCoV-specific antibodies can be detected by either enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA) using TCoV S protein [3, 4], TCoV N protein [5, 6], or IBV virions [7] or immunofluorescent antibody ( IFA) assay using intestine sections containing TCoV [8]. Among different serological tests, virus neutralization ( VN) assay is the most specific test showing the inhibition of viral infection to target host tissues or cells by protective neutralizing antibodies. Without cell culture system available for TCoV, embryonated turkey eggs are used for VN assay of TCoV. Because TCoV infection usually does not cause embryonic death, IFA assay [4, 8] or real-time RT-PCR [9] is used to detect TCoV in the intestines of turkey embryos to determine whether or not turkey embryos are infected by TCoV. In this chapter, a protocol for VN assay is described for determining the VN titer of serum from turkeys infected with TCoV or receiving experimental vaccines against TCoV infection. In step 1, TCoV stock and serum to be tested are diluted and incubated for neutralization reaction. In step 2, the mixture of TCoV and serum is inoculated into embryonated turkey eggs. In step 3, the infection of TCoV is determined by the detection of TCoV in the intestines of turkey embryos using IFA assay. In step 4, VN titer, the dilution of serum that can inhibit TCoV infection in 50 % of inoculated embryonated turkey eggs, is calculated according to the results of IFA assay [4, 10].",

            "text": "\nTitration of TCoV is to measure the concentration of infectious TCoV in the TCoV-containing intestine homogenate. The infectivity unit of TCoV is the 50 % embryo infectious dose or EID50. One EID50 unit is the amount of virus that will infect 50 % of virus-inoculated embryonated eggs. Immunofluorescence antibody assay is used to determine the number of turkey embryos infected with TCoV. Example for calculating virus infectivity titer is illustrated below. According to the results of IFA assay, the number of TCoV-infected or non-infected eggs, the accumulated number of TCoV-infected, non-infected, or tested eggs, and the infection percentage of eggs inoculated with tenfold serially diluted TCoV can be calculated (Table 1). The index is calculated by the infection percentage:\nIndex = [(% Infected at dilution immediately above 50 %) \u2212 50 %]/[(% Infected at dilution immediately above 50 %) \u2212 (% Infected at dilution immediately below 50 %)]% infected at dilution immediately above 50 %: 10\u22123 \u2192 62.5 %% infected at dilution immediately below 50 %: 10\u22124 \u2192 25 %Index = (62.5 % \u2212 50 %)/(62.5 % \u2212 25 %) = 12.5 %/37.5 % = 0.33.The index is then applied to the dilution that produced the percentage infected immediately above 50 %. In this example is the 10\u22123 dilution. The index of 0.33 is applied to this dilution. In this example, the dilution that provided the 50 % infection of eggs or 1 EID50 is 10\u22123.33.The reciprocal of this dilution is the amount of virus contained in the 0.2 mL of the original suspension = 103.33 EID50/0.2 mL = 5 \u00d7 103.33 EID50/mL = 1.05 \u00d7 104 EID50/mL. Thus, the infectivity titer of TCoV has been calculated to be 1.05 \u00d7 104 EID50/mL.\nTurkey coronavirus is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus, so it is very fragile and sensitive to the process of freezing and thawing. It is recommended to use \u221280 or \u221220 \u00b0C pre-equilibrated CoolBox\u2122 (VWR, Batavia, IL, USA) to transport virus vials from \u221280 \u00b0C freezer to laboratory before dilution and inoculation.Example for calculating VN titer is illustrated below.Serum sample A is used for VN titer calculation. Anti-TCoV serum is used as a positive control serum. Both serum A and anti-TCoV serum are diluted into 1:4, 1:16, and 1:64, respectively. Infection of TCoV in the embryonated eggs is determined by IFA assay. The number of TCoV-infected or non-infected eggs, the accumulated number of TCoV-infected, non-infected, or tested eggs, and the infection percentage of eggs inoculated with tenfold serially diluted TCoV can be calculated (Table 2). The index is calculated by the neutralization percentage:\nIndex = [(% Neutralized at dilution immediately above 50 %) \u2212 50 %]/[(% Neutralized at dilution immediately above 50 %) \u2212 (%Neutralization at dilution immediately below 50 %)].1. For anti-TCoV serum, % neutralized at dilution immediately above 50 % is 85.7 % and the dilution is 4\u22122; % neutralized at dilution immediately below 50 % is 33.3 % and the dilution is 4\u22123. Therefore, the index is (85.7 % \u2212 50 %)/(85.7 % \u2212 33.3 %) = 0.68.The index is then applied to the dilution that produced the percentage neutralized immediately above 50 %, which is 4\u22122 dilution.For anti-TCoV serum, the dilution that can provide 50 % neutralization of TCoV on the infection of turkey embryo is 4\u22122.68. Therefore, the VN titer of anti-TCoV serum is 1:41.2. For serum A, % neutralized at dilution immediately above 50 % is 71.4 % and the dilution is 4\u22121; % neutralized at dilution immediately below 50 % is 28.6 % and the dilution is 4\u22122. Therefore, the index is (71.4 % \u2212 50 %)/(71.4 % \u2212 28.6 %) = 0.5.The index is then applied to the dilution that produced the percentage neutralized immediately above 50 %, which is 4\u22121 dilution.For serum A, the dilution that can provide 50 % neutralization of TCoV on the infection of turkey embryo is 4\u22121.5. Therefore, the VN titer of anti-TCoV serum is 1:8.3. In conclusion, anti-TCoV serum has higher VN titer of 1:41 than the VN titer of serum A, which is 1:8.\n",
