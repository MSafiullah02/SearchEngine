To prevent stage III spreading of the virus or human-to-human transmission, various countries have imposed variable number of lockdown days that ranges from 2 \u2212 4 weeks. Depending on the real-time situation, various nations are updating on their lockdown period. However, it was not possible to determine or predict accurately the ideal number of lockdown days in advance as we are all fighting against a novel virus. Still, based on the nature of pandemics and epidemics in the past and the successful mode of encounter with them, the human race has learnt how to fight out the disease, in absence of any specific treatment. Mostly on the basis of the average incubation period of SARS-CoV2 virus, countries have devised the phase of lockdown. In the present day, the COVID-19 pandemic figures from developed countries have surpassed the figures from China, from where this infection had originated. In such a dire situation, it is very difficult to propose quintessential lockdown period specific to any country. The whole world is struggling to obtain unbiased data to predict on the pandemic. But even then many questions arise in our minds as \"Will the implemented number of lockdown days eradicate the virus?\" or \"Will it come soon again after the lockdown is over?\" or like \"How soon will the next wave of infection occur, if it comes back again?\" Answer to these questions lies in the idea of critical community size (CCS) from Soper 1 and Bartlett's 2, 3 works in 1920s and 1950s.",

Moreover, we provide country-wise expected time to extinction (TTE) of the disease and the number of people who could safely stay together or quarantine themselves together in clusters. The most interesting observation from our study is that the lockdown of 2 weeks or more (country-specific) will eradicate the disease almost completely. We term this period as Temporary Eradication of Spread Time (TEST) for disease, which is much less than the TTE of the disease. But there will be more waves of infection after different period of time in different countries. Soothing part from our deduction is that the virus will not be able to create any havoc on its return.",

In absence of any specific medicine to treat the disease, patients are given supportive care to help them breathe. But given the mode of transmission of the epidemic, health care systems of even developed countries are crumbling down within a week or two. So along with many other countries densely populated India has resorted to complete lockdown for 3 weeks to prevent stage III transmission of the disease. Available data confirms that the pandemic has affected a million people in around 200 countries till date and already claimed more than 0.05 million lives across the world within approximately two months. After World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the outbreak as a pandemic, many countries initiated partial to complete lockdown as done in some provinces of China after the outbreak started and by the end of March, one-third of the global population is under some form of lockdown.",

Bartlett introduced critical community size.

Local extinction of the disease could be possible if the susceptible population gets depleted. In large communities, the tendency of eventual damp down of the recurrent epidemics is balanced by random variability. But in small communities the infection would die out when the number of susceptible falls below a certain threshold, which is the CCS. Only a limited number of works 4, 5 including our work (under review) are available on CCS, may be because it involves complicated calculations even for simplest mathematical model viz. SI (S: Susceptible, I: Infected) model. However, since the actual extent of an epidemic can be assessed only retrospectively, it is essential to calculate the CCS for COVID-19 based on a realistic model that depends on the parameters which could be determined for a specific locality.",

E(\u03c4 Q ) involves some probability terms that we evaluate using diffusion approximation of the scaled state variables (S, E, I, R). \u03c4 Q is a function of the CCS. We derive quasi-periodT 0 (say) in terms of angular frequency that is obtained using linearised system at equilibrium points. Then using the relation E(\u03c4 Q ) log 2 =T 0 , 4 we could finally evaluate the CCS for the system.

This time is usually little more than one day of the exposure. So, we have assumed that after day 1 of the exposure to the virus, the host becomes contagious, i.e an exposed person has 93% chance of transmitting the infection as that of an infected person. Since the incubation period of COVID-19 is 14 days, we take \u03c6 = 1 \u2212 1 14 = 0.93. Another very tricky and country dependent parameter is the rate of detection of positive cases from among the exposed pool of people, i.e. percentage of exposed people that are actually tested to be COVID-19 positive. In absence of manpower and testing kits in such a dire situation, we will not be able to know the actual proportion of the exposed who could later on become COVID-19 patient.

This is further magnified due to almost paralysed transactions in many sectors due to lockdown. Moreover, there is a fear among the general population that if any infection pops up, it might create another round of spread of the disease. This fear, which is not completely unrealistic, may extend the lockdown further. However, after the scheduled lockdown period, if any individual gets infected and a few others get exposed to that person, we need to check whether the total number of such individuals is less than the CCS. If so, this group needs to be quarantined and the rest of the population would be free from immediate danger. However, if the exposed group is larger than the CCS, we recommend to split them in subgroups, each of size at most CCS and quarantine them separately. However, careful and detail surveillance is required to trace all such exposed and infected individuals. Moreover, this localised lockdown or quarantine would help flowing the daily life and might prevent, at least to some extent, the economy from being further weak.",

Otherwise if one big room accommodates a large number of patients, secondary infection may start spreading.
