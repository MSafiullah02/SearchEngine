Distance covariance and distance correlation are analogous to product-moment covariance and correlation, but generalize and extend these classical bivariate measures of dependence. Distance correlation characterizes independence: it is zero if and only if the random vectors are independent. The notion of covariance with respect to a stochastic process is introduced, and it is shown that population distance covariance coincides with the covariance with respect to Brownian motion; thus, both can be called Brownian distance covariance. In the bivariate case, Brownian covariance is the natural extension of product-moment covariance, as we obtain Pearson product-moment covariance by replacing the Brownian motion in the definition with identity. The corresponding statistic has an elegantly simple computing formula. Advantages of applying Brownian covariance and correlation vs the classical Pearson covariance and correlation are discussed and illustrated.",

The importance of independence arises in diverse applications, for inference and whenever it is essential to measure complicated dependence structures in bivariate or multivariate data. This paper focuses on a new dependence coefficient that measures all types of dependence between random vectors X and Y in arbitrary dimension. Distance correlation and distance covariance (Sz\u00e9kely, Rizzo, and Bakirov [28] ), and Brownian covariance, introduced in this paper, provide a new approach to the problem of measuring dependence and testing the joint independence of random vectors in arbitrary dimension.
