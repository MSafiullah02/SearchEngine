            "text": "In 2003, an outbreak of a novel virus occurred in China and spread through several countries. The identified agent, a previously unknown coronavirus, was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Much like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV has an \u223c30 kb RNA genome with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail (Snijder et al., 2003 \u25b6). The genome of SARS-CoV codes for two large polyproteins 1a and 1ab, which are autoproteolytically processed by at least two viral proteases, producing 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). These nsps are thought to form a huge protein complex that is responsible for viral RNA replication and transcription. In addition, a set of subgenomic mRNAs encoding structural and accessory proteins is produced by a sophisticated mechanism involving nested mRNA synthesis using the full-length genomic RNA as template. These mRNAs are thought to be capped and polyadenylated (Lai & Stohlman, 1981 \u25b6; van Vliet et al., 2002 \u25b6).",

In recent years, many three-dimensional structures of replication proteins have appeared in the literature, including those of nsp1 (Almeida et al., 2007 \u25b6); several domains of nsp3 [including (i) an N-terminal Glu-rich acidic domain (AD; Serrano et al., 2007 \u25b6), (ii) an X domain (XD; Egloff et al., 2006 \u25b6), (iii) the SUD domain (SARS-CoV unique domain; Chatterjee et al., 2009 \u25b6) and (iv) the papain-like protease PLP2 (Ratia et al., 2006 \u25b6)]; nsp5 (Anand et al., 2002 \u25b6); a complex consisting of nsp7\u2013nsp8 (Zhai et al., 2005 \u25b6); the RNA-binding protein nsp9 (Egloff et al., 2004 \u25b6); the zinc-binding protein nsp10 (Joseph et al., 2006 \u25b6, Su et al., 2006 \u25b6); and the hexameric RNA endonuclease nsp15 (Ricagno et al., 2006 \u25b6). In many cases, the crystal structures allowed scientists to suggest or to ascertain a biochemical function for the nsps, such as nsp7\u2013nsp8, which acts as an RNA-dependent RNA primase (Imbert et al., 2006 \u25b6), and the nsp15 endonuclease, the active site of which has been found to share structural homology to the active site of RNAse A (Ricagno et al., 2006 \u25b6; Joseph et al., 2007 \u25b6). The process of RNA capping, however, has not yet benefitted from this structural work. Structural data is lacking for the enzymes that are putatively involved in mRNA capping.",

            "text": "In eukaryotes, mRNA capping results from a series of three to four canonical reactions acting on the 5\u2032-end of the mRNA. The nascent mRNA transcript endures a limited dephosphorylation in which the last 5\u2032-phosphate is removed by a 5\u2032-RNA triphosphatase. A guanylyl\u00adtransferase (also named capping enzyme) attaches a GMP molecule onto the 5\u2032-diphosphate RNA in a 5\u2032-to-5\u2032 orientation. The capped RNA is then methylated at the N7 position of the cap guanine nucleotide by an N7-guanine methyltransferase. This yields a cap-0 structure (m7GpppNN\u2026) as found mainly in yeasts and lower eukaryotes. In higher eukaryotes and plants, a second methyltransferase acts on the first transcribed nucleotide at its 2\u2032-O position to yield a cap-1 structure (m7GpppN2\u2032OmN\u2026), such as that found on coronavirus mRNAs (Lai & Stohlman, 1981 \u25b6; van Vliet et al., 2002 \u25b6).",

A hit condition was observed in 0.1 M bicine pH 9, 2 M MgCl2 after one week. Crystallization optimization was performed by vapour diffusion using the hanging-drop method at 293 K in Linbro plates (Hampton Research). 2 \u00b5l drops (consisting of 1.5 \u00b5l protein solution and 0.5 \u00b5l precipitant solution) were equilibrated against 1 ml reservoir solution. Optimization of crystal-growth conditions led to the following condition: 0.1 M CHES pH 9, 1.52 M MgCl2. Crystals appeared after 24 h and visible growth stopped after 48\u201372 h. Before cooling the crystals to 100 K in a nitrogen-gas stream (Oxford Cryosystems), the crystals were briefly soaked in a cryoprotectant consisting of 15%(v/v) glycerol added to the mother liquor. Native diffraction data were recorded using either an ADSC Quantum 315 3 \u00d7 3 array detector on beamline PROXIMA 1 at the SOLEIL Synchrotron Radiation Facility or an ADSC Quantum 210 2 \u00d7 2 array detector on beamline ID14-EH1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility.

Although significant amounts (on a milligram scale) of nsp16 can be obtained when expressed alone, the protein is unstable in a variety of buffers and precipitates under various storage conditions. Moreover, although signature-sequence analyses unambiguously identified a SAM-dependent methyltransferase fold (von Grotthuss et al., 2003 \u25b6; Decroly et al., 2008 \u25b6), SARS-CoV nsp16 alone does not exhibit this enzymatic activity. In contrast, nsp10 is expressed to high levels in E. coli and can readily be purified and crystallized. Two structures of nsp10 crystal forms were published in 2006: one revealed monomers and dimers (Joseph et al., 2006 \u25b6) at 1.8 \u00c5 resolution (PDB entry 2fyg), whereas a complex dodecameric structure at 2.1 \u00c5 resolution (PDB entry 2g9t) was observed when nsp10 was expressed and crystallized as a fusion with nsp11 (Su et al., 2006 \u25b6).

This observation prompted us to co-express the two proteins in the prokaryotic expression vector and to attempt purification of the complex. Nsp10 was cloned under the control of the tetA promoter in fusion with a Strep-Tag peptide at its N-terminus and nsp16 tagged with a hexahistidine tag at its N-terminus was inserted into the same plasmid under the T7lac promoter. After transformation into bacterial strain C41, protein expression was induced by the addition of IPTG and tetracycline for 16 h at 297 K. The bacterial lysate was clarified and nsp10 was adsorbed onto Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads. After several washes, the proteins bound to Strep-Tactin were eluted with 2.5 mM of the biotin analogue desthiobiotin. Upon SDS\u2013PAGE analysis, we detected the presence of Strep-nsp10 and His6-nsp16 proteins migrating as expected at around 15 and 35 kDa, respectively, indicating that the two proteins had co-purified (Fig. 1 \u25b6). The overall yield of the purified complex was typically 1 mg per litre of E. coli culture. Estimation of protein concentration and normalization with regard to molecular mass indicated an approximate 1:1 ratio of the proteins.",

We first confirmed the identity of each recombinant protein by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry after in-gel trypsin digestion (data not shown). We also analyzed the proteins eluted from the Strep-Tactin column by size-exclusion chromatography. Fig. 2 \u25b6(a) shows the gel-filtration elution profile. We observed that the stable nsp10\u2013nsp16 complex elutes as a single peak corresponding to 50 kDa. The interaction between nsp10 and nsp16 was also confirmed by a cross-linking experiment. For this purpose, the nsp10\u2013nsp16 complex was incubated with 0.005% SAB, a cross-linking reagent that specifically reacts with lysine residues. After SDS\u2013PAGE separation, we detected the bands corresponding to nsp10 and nsp16 monomers as well as an additional band corresponding to a nsp10\u2013nsp16 complex migrating around 50 kDa (lane Xtal in Fig. 3 \u25b6\nb). The presence of nsp16 in the complex was also demonstrated by a methyltransferase assay (Selisko et al., 2010 \u25b6) which showed that the purified fraction containing the nsp10\u2013nsp16 complex exhibited 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity on short N7-methylated capped RNA substrates (Bouvet et al., 2010 \u25b6). Together, these results indicate that we have developed a method allowing the production and purification of an active nsp10\u2013nsp16 complex by a one-step procedure.
