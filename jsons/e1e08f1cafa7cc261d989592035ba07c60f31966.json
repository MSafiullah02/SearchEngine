An increasing number of studies have examined global health from diverse perspectives to promote the realization of global public health. The purpose of this research is to systematically and comprehensively evaluate the knowledge structure, knowledge domain, and evolution trend in the field of global health research. Based on the 14,692 document data retrieved from Web of Science Core Collection from 1996 to 2019, this article carried out a visual analysis of global health research from the perspective of scientific output characteristics, scientific research cooperation networks, keywords, and highly cited literature. The results show that scholars' interest in global health research is increasing, especially after the outbreak of SARS. USA, England, Canada, Australia, and China have the most prominent contributions to global health research. Significant authors, high impact journals and core institutions also identified. The study found that \"global health governance\", \"global health diplomacy\", \"medical education\", \"global health education\" and \"antimicrobial resistance\" are the research frontiers and hot spots. This study provides an overview and valuable guidance for researchers and related personnel to find the research direction and practice of global health.",

Therefore, the health status of the public in one country is not only determined by the political, economic, and cultural development of the land but also affected by the health and safety status of other countries in the world [1] . Due to the globalization, complexity, and diversification of health influence factors, the development of global health requires all-round cooperation from all countries in the world. Global health, in a broad context, refers to improving public health worldwide, reducing disparities, and protecting against global threats that do not consider national borders [2] .",

Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus in 2019 , the number of people infected with the virus worldwide has reached more than 2.1 million, causing more than 145,000 deaths, and the epidemic has spread to 211 countries (as of 15 April 2020) [4] . The new coronavirus epidemic has brought tremendous harm and threat to the health of the global public and also exposed many problems in global health governance [5] . In this context, the global experts and scholars' attention to global health likely will further increase. To promote the deepening of research in global health, it is particularly essential to comprehensively summarize and review the current research results in the field of global health. Gostin et al. introduced the development history, framework, and deficiencies of global health law, and sought to establish domestic and global links in the field of health law [6] . Dieleman et al. examined the status and characteristics of fiscal health expenditures in 195 countries/regions and predicted the future development trend of global health spending [7] . Garc\u00eda et al. revealed the severity and causes of corruption in the global health system, noting that policymakers, research scholars, and funders need to clarify their responsibilities and treat corruption as an essential area of research [8] . Herath et al. combed the research literature of interprofessional education in global health care and analyzed the main differences and features of global health education for undergraduates and postgraduates in developed and developing countries [9] . Other scholars have reviewed different aspects of global health, such as experience and progress in the prevention and control of infectious diseases [10] , lessons learned and theoretical basis for the implementation of global health security [11] , and mechanisms for international institutions to participate in global health governance [12] . Most of the existing studies started from a single perspective or focused on a specific research area of global health, which lacks a comprehensive and systematic review of global health research.",

In the past, the number of research literature on global health has multiplied [14, 15] . Because global health research involves multiple disciplines and scattered research themes, it has brought a lot of difficulties for global health researchers to grasp this emerging research area and find research hotspots. Due to the development of technologies such as data mining, information analysis, and graphic drawing, the organic combination of computer technology and traditional mathematical statistics has made it possible for visual analysis of scientific metrology. Scientometrics can intuitively show the information panorama of each discipline through the knowledge map, and explore research hotspots and emerging trends in a particular field [16] . It is widely used in the areas of environmental ecology [17] , public health [18, 19] , business economics, artificial intelligence [20] , education research, resource science [21] , and medicine.",

Each of these databases has advantages and disadvantages. Google Scholar has a broad coverage of literature data and plentiful literature types, but it has low data quality and many duplicate data [22] . PubMed is a free biomedical information retrieval system developed by the NCBI. PubMed has a rich literature in the medical field but lacks literature data in other subject areas. Scopus and Web of Science are comprehensive databases, and there is not much difference in data coverage between the two. However, some scholars have shown that when using CiteSpace software for visual analysis, the knowledge map made by the literature of the Web of Science database is better [23, 24] . Therefore, this study uses the Web of Science to retrieve the literature data needed for analysis. To ensure the reliability of the scientific metrological analysis, we chose the Web of Science core collection, and the indexes are SCI-EXPANDED, SSCI, CCR-EXPANDED, and Index Chemicus. The detailed retrieval strategy is shown in Figure 1 . After preliminary searching, 14,692 pieces of literature data were obtained. For some reason, there are differences and ambiguities in the expressions of author names, institution names, and country names in literature data. In response to this, before conducting scientific measurement analysis, we used CiteSpace's data deduplication and name merge functions to standardize the data. ",

In order to further understand the clustering theme, we have summarized the detailed information of clustering and plotted it as Table 7 . It can be seen from Table 7 that the silhouette values of all clustering results are greater than 0.7, indicating that there is no problem with clustering. According to Figure 8 and Table 6 , currently, \"global health governance\", \"global health diplomacy\", \"medical education\", \"global health education\", \"antimicrobial resistance\" and \"Zika Virus\" are the research frontiers and hot spots in the global health field. In addition, \"quality of life\", \"energy balance; adipose tissue; appetite\", \"subunit vaccine\", \"mental illness\", \"mental health\", \"community impact\", \"health services\" and \"interaction strategies\" are important research topics and directions of global health.",

Keywords can clearly and intuitively reflect the research theme, core research content, and main research direction of an article. Therefore, in the fields of scientific text mining and scientometrics, the co-occurrence analysis of keywords can quickly grasp the development trends and research topics of a specific research field [49] . From the results of keyword co-occurrence analysis, there are five main research topics in the global health field, including global health goals and directions, research on global health risk factors, research on specific groups and specific countries or regions, and research on cooperative communication mechanisms. The goal of global health is to improve the equity of global health and the quality of life of people worldwide [50] . The original intention of the rise of global health is based on its effective way of dealing with global health inequity, which provides a new perspective and approach for achieving the goal of global health equity [51] . Global health focuses on the fairness and health influencing factors of global health, not just the health status and influencing factors of people in a specific country or region. Global health also pays attention to the global distribution of health and disease and its determinants, attaches importance to the impact of globalization on health and changes in the nature of global health governance, and emphasizes interdependence and coping strategies that transcend national and policy sector boundaries [52, 53] .",

The theoretical research and practical aspects of global health reflect that poor governance at the national and international levels will undermine the achievement of global health goals [55] . The catalyst for global health implementation is global health diplomacy. An important change in the 2000 G-8 summit was the linking of foreign policy with global health issues, and global health began to become a major goal and strategy of foreign policy. Global health diplomacy promotes the participation of various actors in the global governance actions taken to solve global health and related issues [56] . Some sovereign countries have established bilateral or multilateral global health strategies with other countries or organizations through mechanisms such as foreign policy and negotiation and consultation, formulated global health plans, and provided relevant financial and technical assistance to low-and middle-income countries [57] .",
