In each case there is a strong sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for those scientists involved in drug discovery. A lack of available antivirals to treat the infected patients leads to a clamoring to test anything available, and some pharmaceutical companies charge in to offer their drugs. We also seem to see similar patterns in response across outbreaks. There is a rush to be 'first' and this sense of priority might not lead to the best or even any outcome for patients. Always, there is the immediate proposal to create a vaccine and pronouncements that this will be available in a short time or by the end of the year of the actual outbreak in question; and it never happens within these optimistic artificial deadlines. Again, we have experienced this with the current outbreak. For Ebola the vaccine was ready for the second outbreak and has now been approved [6] .",

In the case of SARS-CoV-2 it results in pneumonia [7] and shares aspects of pathology and pathogenesis with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [8] . SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to the same family Coronaviridae and genus Betacoronavirus. Several drug companies immediately made their antivirals available. For example, Abbvie made their HIV approved drug lopinavir/ritonavir combination available to the Chinese government [9] . This drug had previously been suggested as promising based on combination study results from a marmoset study [10] . Publications have already appeared describing the use of this drug in a patient in Korea, significantly decreasing the viral load [11] . Simultaneously, Gilead made available remdesivir, which had previously failed in clinical trials for Ebola [12] but had recently shown activity against MERS in rhesus macaques [13] . Remdesivir, chloroquine and several other drugs were tested in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1 ) and shown to be active [14] . Some researchers had also suggested as early as January 2020 what treatment options might be most likely and these included lopinavir/ritonavir, remdesivir, favilavir, arbidol, as well as a broad array of nucleoside analogs, neuraminidase inhibitors, peptides, RNA synthesis inhibitors, anti-inflammatory drugs and traditional Chinese medicines [15] [16] [17] .",

Already in the past weeks we have seen the rapid spread to Italy and from there to many other countries including Brazil and beyond. Such virus outbreaks are greatly straining the healthcare systems of affected countries and will test every aspect of our infrastructure, supply chains and preparedness [20] . This raises the question of what we can learn from our past drug discovery efforts in an attempt to develop additional drugs for SARS-CoV-2 more efficiently. The acceleration of global SARS-Cov-2 data generation, effectively just in a couple of months, has been remarkable. However, scientific information gaps that impede progress toward small-molecule treatments can still be perceived. Many of these persist from when they were first outlined for Ebola back in 2015 [21] . We can thus make some 'then-and-now' comparisons (see Supplementary material Figs. S1-S4 and Table S1 online) as well as share our own experiences of research on these virus outbreaks.",

Our Ebola machine learning models were used to select three molecules for in vitro testing [28] . We identified pyronaridine, tilorone and quinacrine as having good in vitro activity (nM) against the Ebola virus [28] . These preliminary data enabled us to obtain funding from the NIH to take one of the compounds through in vivo testing. We also leveraged NIH support to a collaborator to test the other two compounds as well. These molecules were then each tested in the mouse model for Ebola infection and demonstrated significant efficacy [29] [30] [31] . Pyronaridine is currently being pursued in larger animal models of Ebola virus infection. Working on computational models through to in vitro testing happened in the space of a few months, whereas it took several years to obtain funding for our first mouse studies. This is by no means a streamlined approach to drug discovery but it was cost effective for the amount of data ultimately generated and led to revitalized interest in these molecules.",

            "text": "In 2016 we pulled together a team of researchers in Brazil and the USA to provide some suggestions for an open drug discovery effort for the Zika virus. These included various computational strategies to repurpose molecules and docking into the Zika proteins [32] . We also described resources and molecules that could be prioritized for testing. This was followed by our homology modeling of every Zika virus protein [33] weeks before the first crystal structures for Zika proteins were released. All of this work was performed in the open and it attracted the attention of the IBM World Community Grid team who requested we submit a proposal to them for a Zika project using their distributed computing facilities. This became the OpenZika project led by our team in Brazil and the USA and it involved the docking of millions of molecules from the ZINC database in all Zika virus and related flavivirus protein crystal structures [34] . We have since also performed further modeling of Zika proteins [35] and an analysis of the first 2 years following the outbreak [36] . Our most recent efforts have led to the discovery of an inhibitor for NS3 helicase [37] . What we can learn from the OpenZika project to streamline future open science projects would be as follows. We would pick fewer targets to dock molecules into as the OpenZika project created billions of docking results for tens of targets that will take many years to process. We would also suggest that it is best to work with high-resolution crystal structures versus homology models as soon as possible. We would also start with a library of commercially available drugs and antivirals, this would massively limit the number of molecules docked to a few thousand because we found that docking of the ZINC library available at that time led to compounds that were not readily available. Focused libraries are interesting options to perform target-directed virtual screening. Examples are ChemDiv [38] and Asinex [39] databases, which have specific subsets for protease inhibitors, for example facilitating and accelerating the experimental screening. During OpenZika we learnt that having multiple biology labs committed to doing testing in vitro is also very important to have access to experimental results more quickly to validate the computational approach. Working with the IBM World Community Grid did not include any funding. We found it very difficult to obtain NIH funding to support this project from the very beginning (because it was computational) and also attempted small business grants with academic collaborators without success, even though we were leveraging massive computational resources through the World Community Grid. We would recommend that open efforts like this need some funding for in vitro validation. Millions of dollars have been invested by the NIH to fund other Zika research projects since the 2016 outbreak and there is as yet no small molecule of note in the drug discovery pipeline [36] . There is still therefore an unmet medical need for treatments for Zika virus and computational efforts could aid this and be cost-effective.",

Using our SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein model and the available SARS-CoV Spike protein crystal structure (PDB: 2AJF), we aligned both structures to compare the residues in the Spike-ACE2 interface residues for both viruses. As can be seen in Fig. 1 , the residues for SARS-CoV are Asn473, Tyr475, Tyr440, Tyr436, Tyr484, Leu472, Tyr442 and Asn479 and for SARS-CoV-2 are Asn167, Tyr169, Tyr133, Tyr129, Gln178, Phe166, Leu135 and Gln173. Moreover, some SARS-CoV-2 residues, such as Gln178, Phe166, Leu135 and Gln173, are not conserved but have the same physical-chemical features, except the residues SARS-CoV-2 Gln178 (polar) and SARS Tyr484 (hydrophobic) (Fig. 1) .",

The results of both docking approaches indicated that azatanavir and lopinavir could be of most interest for in vitro or in vivo testing (Fig. 4) . Atazanavir can interact with M pro by H-bonding at Cys145 and the amide group. The aromatic ring of atazanavir (LigandFit score of 191.196) also formed hydrophobic interactions with residues Cys44, Met49, Leu50, Tyr54 and Cys145. In relation to lopinavir (LigandFit score of 175.497), H-bonds were established between residues Cys145 and Glu166 and nitrogen atoms of carbamate groups. Similar hydrophobic interactions were observed with lopinavir (Fig. 4) . In China and South Korea lopinavir 200 mg/ritonavir 50 mg has already been used for the treatment of COVID-19. From the day after lopinavir/ritonavir administration, the viral load started to decrease and no detectable or little coronavirus titers have been observed since then [11] . Lopinavir, co-formulated with ritonavir is commercially available and known as Kaletra1 around the world-it is on formularies for HIV. By contrast, atazanavir is less commonly used. Kaletra1 can be widely produced and distributed quickly through existing channels but it will be important to ensure HIV patients do not lose access to the medications they need. It is also a medication that clinicians are familiar with in terms of side effects, unlike other less commonly used medications. A broader analysis of all FDA-approved drugs docked in this protease structure could point to further drugs worth testing. We have also performed docking calculations of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein complexed with the host ACE2 protein against all FDA-approved drugs ($2400 molecules) using Schr\u00f6dinger Glide software [70] [71] [72] [73] . Because there was only one Cryo-EM structure of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with low resolution (3.46 \u00c5 ) without the human ACE2 protein [48] at the time of doing this analysis, we preferred to build a model by homology modeling, because lower-resolution structures (3 \u00c5 or higher) show the basic contours of the protein chain and the atomic structure must be inferred. We built the SARS-CoV-2 Spike subunit S1 model using the SwissModel server [74] . The template used was the SARS-CoV Spike S1 protein (PDB ID 2GHV) [75] , which has resolution of 2.2 \u00c5 and 73.22% of sequence identity with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. After the protein refinement, we added the human ACE2 protein to the model, based on the SARS-CoV Spike-ACE2 structure (PDB ID 2AJF) [76] , and built the full SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1-ACE2 model (see Fig. S5 in Supplementary material online). The quality statistics of the modeled SARS-CoV-2 Spike--ACE2 were good: 96.53% of the residues lie in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot and the Molprobity score was Intermolecular 3D and 2D interactions of atazanavir (a) and lopinavir (b) with the main protease structure of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB ID 6LU7) obtained by docking. In the 3D representation (left), H-bonds are presented as magenta dashed lines and the color code of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen atoms are grey, red, blue and white, respectively. In the 2D interaction diagrams (right) H-bonds are presented as magenta arrows. The Pymol software [79] was used for the visual inspection of 3D docking poses and to render the 3D molecular images. 1.66. Our SARS-CoV-2 Spike-ACE2 model is available (see Supplemental material PDB file online). Subsequently, we performed docking-based virtual screening with a grid centered at the Spike--ACE2 interface. As can be seen in Table 3 , docking scores indicated that rizatriptan (an antimigraine agent, Glide score = \u00c07.49 kcal mol \u00c01 ), dasabuvir (an antiviral for hepatitis C, Glide score = \u00c07.92 kcal mol \u00c01 ), pravastatin (a lipid-lowering agent, Glide score = \u00c07.81 kcal mol \u00c01 ) and empagliflozin (a hypoglycemic agent, Glide score = \u00c07.09 kcal mol \u00c01 ) could be of interest for in vitro testing.

In summary, these drugs form p-cation interactions with Lys31a, p-p interactions with Phe170b and H-bonds with His34a, Asp38a, Gly176b and Ser174b. In good agreement with our results, a previous study suggests that an early and high dose of a statin (such as pravastatin) could be crucial to surviving MERS-CoV infection [77] . These suggested molecules could be validated in future in vitro experiments. Modern drug discovery efforts try to eliminate inefficiency by increasing knowledge, through extensive utilization of generated data to guide new experiments. Therefore, we have also taken a drug repurposing approach based on polypharmacology using a method called the 'molecular and biological signature' [78] . This is a profiling approach, guided by artificial intelligence, capable of presenting the complex relationships between the chemical substance with molecular targets, cells and/or organs. This could create a more complete understanding of the 'multi-biological profile' caused by the drug analyzed in response to a disease. As an example, we have applied the drugs ritonavir [9] , favipiravir, ribavirin and chloroquine as scaffolds to find new potential molecular and biological signature profiles, to search for non-obvious, mechanism-of-action-based associations between drugs, molecular targets and diseases ( Fig. 6; and Supplementary material Fig. S6 and Table S3 online). Comparing the molecular and biological signature of ritonavir with other drugs, we found that the drugs cobicistat, carfilzomib and ombitasvir presented the highest matching scores (81-71%), suggesting that those drugs could be of further interest for SARS-CoV-2.",

What we have learnt in these efforts can be applied to SARS-CoV-2 as we have demonstrated here. However, the research in this case has moved at a much faster pace initially, delivering a first crystal structure in just a few weeks after first public notification of the virus. Companies have mobilized to bring their drugs to patients and clinicians have used prior in vitro research that proposed compounds active against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV to suggest treatments for SARS-CoV-2. We currently do not clinically use any broad-spectrum antivirals in the USA but they would be invaluable in situations like this for SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. Identifying medications with side-effect profiles known by clinicians that are already produced at scale and available at local pharmacies around the world will allow more patients to be treated, especially as travel restrictions and quarantines could reduce production and distribution of certain drugs. It will remain important that those who need these medications at baseline, such as HIV patients who take ritonavir/lopinavir, are able to continue to access the medications they need or else there is a risk of poor clinical outcomes and antiviral resistance in these patients. Although other viruses such as the flu might have killed more patients in the USA this season so far, the crippling financial impact of SARS-CoV-2 remains to be seen globally. If past Ebola, ZIKV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks are anything to go by this SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be far more significant. Having multiple effective treatments available for SARS-CoV-2 that can be rapidly delivered to patients could save lives. We can also supplement these treatments by a combination of computational screening with machine learning and docking to select additional drugs to test as proposed herein and this can be repeated for future virus outbreaks. The sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu will probably be repeated again and again with the next virus outbreaks until we develop broader-spectrum antivirals. Each time we hope to be better prepared. Hope however does not save lives. Effective antiviral treatments do, and we need to have them ready in the future. ",
