Therefore, research into cybersecurity readiness in the online retail industry is needed. Technical tools are the foremost measures of defence against these attacks. This study investigates cybersecurity readiness from the technical perspective in some UK online retailers. This research adopted a qualitative case study approach with semi-structured interviews for collecting data. A total of 15 interviews were conducted with an online retail company's staff and management who had responsibility for managing cybersecurity. A thematic analysis method was used to analyse the qualitative data. The research findings show that the company is facing internal and external threats to their information systems and their technical defences are not very effective at present. The company should consider investing more resources in the technical controls to prevent these attacks.",

Some basic security controls such as encryption, anti-virus software, firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) suggested by Sen, Ahmed and Islam [8] could be used to prevent cyber-attacks. Unified Threat Management Systems (UTMS) provide more security to the network layer, hardware and software than standard security methods [9] .

The interview questionnaire was designed with the help of existing literature relevant to the field of information security. A pilot study was conducted with 10 academic staff in the relevant area of study and as a result, some amendments were made to the interview questions according to their suggestions. Moreover, participants were selected on the basis of their job nature and experience in the management of online security in the online retail company in the UK. A total of 15 interviews were conducted with professionals including the IT Manager, Fraud Prevention Manager and members of the Network Security Team. Face-to-face interviews lasted around 45-60 min. All interviews were audio recorded in a hand-held device to be transcribed and analysed later.",

However, two-factor authentication is not always a secure method as cyber-criminals can violate this [22] .

Company A encrypts the data of customers and employees when sending it to third parties and registered post is used to send hard copies of data. Using encryption for sending and receiving information is useful for a company because it prevents modification and keeps data in its original form. This encryption method has a weakness as it does not cover the recipient of any data, as this would need Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE). Therefore, Company A could P2PE to secure its communication channels more effectively [24] . Moreover, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) digital signatures and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) etc. are useful in preventing cybersecurity attacks [25] . Therefore, the company may use these for enhancing cybersecurity infrastructure. (c) Threat Management Threat management is an essential component of the organisation's security process. Businesses that depend on ICT remain under threat from cyber-criminals whose motive is to steal sensitive information by infiltrating systems in different ways. Now, it is the responsibility of the organisation to manage such risks cost-effectively and minimise threats to their information systems. Company A uses various security controls to minimise threats to information system infrastructure. Additionally, the company has professionals who constantly try to manage the security threats. However, some vulnerabilities still exist in these security controls for which Company A should assess regularly to manage security threats. This is also proposed by some researchers such as Taylor [11] . (d) Network Security Network security has a significant role in the information system security of online retail organisations because cyber-criminals attack the network to steal information. Cyber intrusions and attacks occur when unauthorised access is gained to networks, including theft of users' sensitive data, online economic fraud, website destruction, web application attacks and system penetration. Attackers exploit operating system vulnerabilities in web browsers, services and configurations, platform vulnerabilities in web applications, network device vulnerabilities, policy and personnel vulnerabilities in unauthorised devices [26] . Company A did face cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, because of weaknesses in the network. However, encryption, anti-virus, firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are useful in preventing cyberattacks [8] . Therefore, the company should configure its firewalls to prevent denial of service attacks on the network. Firewalls are useful in preventing unauthorised access to the network and in blocking unwanted traffic into the company's network (Sen et al.) [8] . A firewall is a shield that works against dangerous communications from disseminating across any network, either from the outside world into a local system, or from one part of a local network to another. It is a useful element in network access because it can prevent unauthorised access at the boundary of a network and infrastructure.",
