Nevertheless, scarce information was present dealing with the prevalence and molecular epidemiology of these infections in Greece and the efficacy of currently applied control strategies. To fill this gap, a specific epidemiological study was designed. A total of 106 broiler and layer farms, including 10 backyard and 96 commercial flocks, were sampled between March 2016 and May 2017, and the obtained tracheal swabs were tested for IBV and aMPV using RT-PCR based techniques followed by sequencing. For each farm, data regarding production type, flock features, clinical signs, and vaccination program were also recorded. Different associations between vaccination protocol, production type, animal category, birds density, age, presence of clinical signs, and IBV and/or aMPV infection were tested. Both IBV and aMPV field strain prevalence were proven high, approximately 20 and 30%, re-spectively, being the GI-19 lineage (14 out of 19; 73.6%) and B subtype (30 out of 30; 100%), the most commonly detected IBV and aMPV genetic types. Infection with IBV field strains was significantly associated with clinical sign presence (odds ratio = 8.55 ). Remarkably, only the vaccination protocol involving a double vaccination at 1 D of age was proven protective against IBV-induced symptomatology, with the odds of developing disease being 4.14 [95CI = 1.34-14.51] times lower.",

Repercussions in primary needs, like food access, have also been noted, with a relevant decline in the supply of animal origin protein (g/capita/day) (http://www.fao.org/faostat/). Traditionally, poultry meat and eggs have been considered cheap sources of high biological value proteins. Nevertheless, although the poultry production remained substantially stable over time, production price index of chicken meat increased by about 25% between 2009 and 2014 with relevant consequences on prices for the final customers and their alimentary habits (http://www.fao.org/faostat/). As easily predictable, this dramatic situation went with the bankruptcy of over 60,000 poultry farms in the last decade (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat), especially the small-medium sized ones.",

As the other single-stranded RNA viruses, IBV is featured by a high substitution and recombination rate (Duffy et al., 2008; Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011) , which has led to the emergence of several genotypes and lineages over time (Valastro et al., 2016) . Additionally, the wide commercial network among countries has been favoring the spreading of several livestock diseases all over the world (Franzo et al., 2016a (Franzo et al., , 2017a (Franzo et al., , 2018 , enhancing the likelihood of introducing new strains with different immunological features in naive animal populations. This high genetic and antigenic heterogeneity has severely hindered the implementation of effective control measures, which currently rely mainly on vaccination application (de Wit et al., 2011) . In fact, a limited cross-protection has been demonstrated especially between different genotypes, although the genetic distance is a poor proxy of immunological features (de Wit et al., 2011) . Besides the development and administration of homologous vaccines, the immunization using multiple vaccines, based on different genotypes, has been proven beneficial, broadening the protection spectrum (Cook et al., 1999) . However, other practical managerial factors like vaccine application route, dose, timing, and housing conditions can substantially reduce the vaccination efficacy (de Wit et al., 2010) .",

However, most of these detections are, with all likelihood, ascribable to the sampling of vaccine-derived strains. These results are not surprising since the within-farm prolonged circulation of live-attenuated vaccines was already proven by other authors (Cavanagh et al., 1999; Tucciarone et al., 2018a) . Vaccine-like strains were detected in unvaccinated farms or in flocks using other commercial vaccines, further confirming their ability to effectively spread among farms, affecting the epidemiological scenario and complicating its interpretation (Franzo et al., 2014) . Remarkably, a recombinant virus originating from parental strains closely related to QX (GI-19) and 793B (GI-13) vaccines has been identified in a farm where no vaccination scheme against IBV was in place. The widespread vaccination application creates favorable conditions for co-infection, and thus for recombination to occur, particularly when partial vaccination coverage is attained (Moreno et al., 2017) . This risk cannot be underestimated since a high frequency of recombination between vaccine and field strains has frequently been reported (Cavanagh et al., 1992; McKinley et al., 2011; Jackwood et al., 2012) , and high fitness variants can effectively emerge and spread through this evolutionary mechanism (Moreno et al., 2017) . Nevertheless, in this particular case, the detected recombinant more likely represents a transient variant exhibiting a limited fitness, since it has been identified only once and in a limited geographic area.",

However, it must be stressed that the limited availability of properly annotated IBV sequences could have prevented the identification of the actual introduction source.

At first glance, no differences were evidenced in field strain or clinical sign frequency between vaccinated and unvaccinated flocks. These data are quite surprising since most of vaccination schedules in Greece were based on the \"protectotype\" concept (Cook et al., 1999) or, less frequently, on the use of the homologous vaccine, 2 approaches that have been proven valuable in controlling the emergence of overt clinical signs in experimental and field conditions (Terregino et al., 2008; Geerligs et al., 2011; Feng et al., 2015; Franzo et al., 2016b) . Therefore, variables related to animal or vaccination management are probably affecting the vaccination efficacy (de Wit et al., 2010) . Additionally, other factors, like general animal health and not investigated co-infections, could have negatively affected the immunization. Interestingly, while Franzo et al. (2016b) demonstrated the efficacy of both Mass+793B and Mass+QX-based vaccination in reducing viral circulation and clinical outbreaks compared to Mass vaccination alone, the most relevant benefits of double vaccination administration were observed when both vaccines were provided at 1 D of life, mainly at hatchery (Franzo et al., 2016b) . A comparable scenario was also demonstrated in the present study. Despite the fact that no association between administration timing and frequency of field strain detection was demonstrated, the flocks where both vaccines (Mass+793B or QX) were provided at 1 day of life displayed 4.14 (95CI 1.34 to 14.51) times lower odds of developing disease compared to not vaccinated farms. On the other hand, other vaccination strategies did not provide any protective effect compared to no vaccination at all. On the contrary, the increased odds (i.e., 2.26) of developing clinical signs in these flocks, although not significant from a statistical perspective, could be attributable to vaccine reversion to virulence or to the respiratory epithelium damages due to vaccine replication, which can be more marked when partial animal coverage allows for prolonged rolling reactions (McKinley et al., 2008; Cook et al., 2012) .",

These results are in contrast with the traditional belief that a delayed administration of the second vaccine dose should be beneficial because of the recovery time needed by the tracheal epithelium after the first vaccination and the booster effect provided by the second vaccination (Winterfield and Fadly, 1972; Di Matteo et al., 2000) . Nevertheless, the absent or negligible competition between co-administered vaccines was proven in the field (Tucciarone et al., 2018a) , and the effectiveness of this strategy was already proven experimentally (Cook et al., 1999) and through epidemiological studies (de Wit et al., 2010) , although conflicting evidences were reported between broiler and layer flocks (de Wit et al., 2010) . While dedicated studies will be necessary to demonstrate the biological mechanisms behind these empirical evidences, the higher animal coverage and the greater control on vaccination administration conditions when vaccines are provided at hatchery can probably balance and outperform the replicative and immunological advantages expected when the second vaccination is postponed.",

Comparable results were obtained when only broiler farms were considered (data not shown), like in the Italian study (Tucciarone et al., 2018b) .

Nevertheless, no interaction was proven between aMPV and IBV neither in terms of infection frequency nor in the emergence of clinical signs. Different factors could explain the reported differences. At first, Italian and Greek aMPV strains could differ in their biological features. However, all these strains seem to be genetically related, at least in the considered genome region (Figure 4) , lessening this hypothesis. It must be stressed that IBV has been effectively controlled in Italy, an evidence that can easily justify the lower co-infection frequency. Additionally, it has been suggested that the successful IBV vaccination could have altered the competitive equilibrium between IBV and aMPV, favoring the latter (Tucciarone et al., 2018b) . However, the lack of any significant interaction between aMPV and IBV herein demonstrated seems to contradict this hypothesis. Another suggestive hypothesis is the presence of different poultry genetic lines that could exhibit a differential susceptibility to aMPV.",
