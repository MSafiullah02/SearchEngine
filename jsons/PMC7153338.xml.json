They are usually in a few micrometers in length and exist together. Although bacterial cells are much smaller and simpler in structure (Todar, 2013), the sizes of most bacteria range from 0.3 to 3 \u03bcm (Gerardi, 2006). There are many kinds of bacteria, which are widely distributed in nature and closely related to human beings. Some beneficial bacteria have been discovered by human beings. However, there are also countless harmful bacteria in the living environment of human beings, which pollute the air, water, soil, and food and pose a great threat to human health. There are a large number of bacteria in wastewater, and various bacteria and even human pathogenic bacteria can spread by water pollution caused by wastewater discharge, which poses risks to human health and ecological security.",

A few different criteria are used to classify bacteria, based on the differences in shape, metabolism, cell walls, and genetic makeup. One way of classifying them is based on shape, and there are three basic shapes (Dusenbery, 2009): (1) spherical: the bacterial shape likes a ball and a single bacterium is a coccus; (2) rod-shaped: these bacteria are called bacilli (singular bacillus) and part of the rod-shaped bacteria are curved, which are called as vibrio; (3) spiral: these bacteria are known as spirilla (singular spirillus), and they are known as spirochetes if their coil is very tight. Furthermore, a small number of other unusual shapes have been described, such as icosahedron, cube, or star-shaped (Fritz et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2016). The shapes and structures of bacteria are often reflected in their names (Table 3.1)\n.",

Autotrophic bacteria, which only need carbon dioxide as their carbon source, make their food by (1) photosynthesis using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water or (2) chemosynthesis using carbon dioxide, water, and some chemicals (such as ammonia, nitrogen, and sulfur). Heterotrophic bacteria, relying on organic matters as carbon source, get their energy by consuming organic carbon outside the cells. According to their reaction to oxygen, most bacteria can be divided into the following three categories (Joubert and Britz, 1987): (1) aerobic bacteria that can only grow in the presence of oxygen; (2) anaerobic bacteria that can only grow in the absence of oxygen; and (3) facultative anaerobic bacteria that can grow regardless of aerobic and oxygen free.\n",

However, the cell wall of most bacteria is divided into two different types based on the reaction of cells to the Gram stain, which classifies bacteria into Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria (Beveridge, 2001). Gram-positive bacteria have a thick cell wall with peptidoglycan and teichoic acids. On the contrary, a relatively thin cell wall consisting of several layers of peptidoglycan that are surrounded by a second lipid membrane with lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins is possessed by Gram-negative bacteria (Hugenholtz, 2002). Furthermore, some bacteria have cell wall structures that differ from those possessed by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. For instance, Mycobacteria, a clinically important bacterium, have the thick peptidoglycan cell wall and also the second outer layer of lipids (Alderwick et al., 2015).",

This bacterium infects only humans and is usually acquired by ingestion of food or water contaminated by the feces of patients with typhoid or asymptomatic carriers (Dougan and Baker, 2014). There are three strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi including Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi, and Salmonella schottmuelleri. They are Gram-negative, facultative anaerobes, and rod shaped, which do not have spores and capsules. Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs), large genomic regions of 10\u2013134 kb, are responsible for most of the virulence factors. Most of the effector molecules associated with complex pathogenesis are encoded by SPIs (Hensel, 2004). Salmonella typhimurium is also a potential source of human illness, having the ability to transfer from irrigation water to the edible parts of the plants (Lapidot and Yaron, 2009). They are common in wastewater and can be induced into the viable but nonculturable state after typical wastewater disinfection (Oliver et al., 2005). Because the infectious dose of them is only as low as 20 cells per mL, the residual level of them in wastewater also has potential health risks (Oliver et al., 2005). In addition, strains of Salmonella with a greater pathogenic potential have also been isolated from wastewater and activated sludge, and the most frequent serotypes are Salmonella hadar (38.1%), followed by Salmonella enteritidis (23.8%), Salmonella london (14.3%), and Salmonella anatum (9.5%) in raw and treated wastewater (Espigares et al., 2006).",

The accumulated polymorphonuclear leukocytes can pass through the intestinal epithelial cells and destroy the connections between the epithelial cells, allowing more Shigella dysenteriae to reach the submucosal layer through the crack; (4) Shigella dysenteriae further infects adjacent cells, causing an inflammatory reaction when the number of infected cells reaches a certain level, thereby resulting in typical bacterial dysentery symptoms such as congestion, hemorrhage, and edema of the intestinal mucosa.\n",

Furthermore, viruses can self-replicate using the cellular system of hosts, but cannot grow and replicate independently. Furthermore, viruses can infect almost any living organisms with the cellular structure. However, not all the viruses can cause diseases, because the replication of many viruses cannot cause apparent damage to infected organs. Some viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can coexist with the human body for a long time and remain infectious without being affected by the immune system of their hosts. In general, viral infections can trigger immune responses that destroy invading viruses. Vaccination can contribute to these immune responses, so that the vaccinated person or animal can immunize the corresponding virus for life. Microorganisms such as bacteria also have effective mechanisms to protect themselves against viral infections (Wilson and Murray, 1991).\n",

Norovirus infection is also associated with many clinical symptoms, such as necrotizing enterocolitis, infantile epileptic encephalopathy, emphysema enteropathy, and sporadic intravascular coagulation (Chan et al., 2010, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2002, Medici et al., 2010, Turcios-Ruiz et al., 2008). In developing countries, norovirus infection causes approximately 200,000 deaths of children fewer than 5 years old each year (Hall et al., 2013). Recent reports indicate that norovirus is the second leading cause of gastroenteritis-related deaths in the United States, resulting in approximately 797 deaths each year (Hall et al., 2013, Papafragkou et al., 2013). A previous study quantified norovirus genogroups I (GI) and II (GII) in wastewater in France and explored their removals by treatment systems of waste stabilization pond, activated sludge, and submerged membrane bioreactor treatments, which found that all the treatment systems efficiently decreased the level of norovirus contamination in receiving waterbodies (da Silva et al., 2007).",

Moreover, all the protozoa have cell membranes, and the cell membranes of most protozoa are strong and elastic, so that protozoa could remain a certain shape. Generally, protozoa have one or more nuclei, which are various in shapes. However, there are also some protozoa, such as ameba, which have only one layer of the very thin plasma membrane and cannot maintain a fixed shape. Protozoa produce morphological differentiation in their cells and form organelles capable of performing various life activities and physiological functions. In terms of movement organelles, there are flagella, pseudopods, and cilia. Furthermore, some types of protozoa have myofilaments distributed in the cell membrane, which has the function of contraction and deformation.",

Some of the protozoa have two stages of the life cycle, alternating between proliferative stage (trophozoite) and dormant stage (cyst). When protozoa are in the stage of trophozoite, they can actively feed. As cysts, protozoa can survive in the harsh condition including extreme temperatures, harmful chemicals, and fewer nutrients, water or oxygen for a long time. The conversion from trophozoite to cyst is known as encystation, while the process of transforming from cyst to trophozoite is known as excystation.",

These diseases are found in very different parts of human beings and have been documented around the world. There were 214 million cases of symptomatic malaria reported in 2015 (Saheb, 2018). For toxoplasmosis caused by the infection of Toxoplasma gondii, approximately 14% of the individuals in the United States are seropositive to it by the age of 40 years (Saheb, 2018).

Entamoeba histolytica can cause tissue destruction that leads to clinical disease, and the tissue damage is induced by direct host cell death, inflammation, and parasite invasion (Ghosh et al., 2019). It is estimated that Entamoeba histolytica infection kill more than 55,000 people each year (Shirley et al., 2018). The source of infection is food, drinking water, or utensils contaminated with feces containing mature cysts.",

Activated sludge, a widely used wastewater treatment all over the world, has a flocculent structure with protozoa living or crawling around it. There are about 230 species of protozoa observable in the activated sludge system, including Mastigophora (such as Peranema deflexum and Anisonema acinus), Sarcodina (such as Mayorella penardi and Arcella hemisphaerica), ciliated protozoa, and others. Among them, ciliates account for about 70% of the total protozoa in the sludge. During the wastewater purification process, protozoa are responsible for improving the quality and safety of the effluent by keeping the density of dispersed bacteria (Madoni, 2011). The roles of protozoa in wastewater treatment process are (1) direct use of organic matter in wastewater; (2) promotion of flocculation process; and (3) capable of swallowing bacteria and other microorganisms. Moreover, protozoa have a faster rate of bacterial predation and shorter generation time. However, their feeding range is narrow, and they mainly feed on free bacteria, so they are not suitable to be the main predator in the sewage treatment system. Furthermore, other physiological characteristics of bacteria in the sludge, such as athletic ability, morphology, and surface characteristics, can affect the predation of protozoa.",

The highest prevalence of helminth infections occurs in tropical countries where food supplies are inadequate, and parasite eggs, insects, and other invertebrate vectors are abundant.

Furthermore, endotoxin may enhance the toxic effects of other toxic substances, such as algal toxins (Best et al., 2002, Roth et al., 1997). Therefore, some control standards of endotoxin have proposed that the endotoxin content of water for injection should be less than 0.25 EU/mL (Anderson et al., 2002). For the workers in the wastewater treatment plant, endotoxin exposure ranged from 0.6 to 2093 EU/m3, and the geometric mean exposure was low (27 EU/m3) (Smit et al., 2005). Some symptoms appeared to be more prevalent in workers when they were exposed to endotoxin with a level higher than 50 EU/m3 (Smit et al., 2005). Endotoxin activity has been assessed in several WWTPs using the samples collected from influent, effluent, return sludge, and advanced treatment effluent in Sapporo and Japan, which have revealed that active endotoxin materials occurred in wastewater and endotoxin activity was high in wastewater (Guizani et al., 2009). Moreover, the discharge of effluent of treatment plants has increased the endotoxicity in the receiving river water (Ohkouchi et al., 2007). Guizani (2010) have reported that biological treatment cannot control endotoxicity and can produce organic matters with endotoxicity during wastewater reclamation.",

As early as in 2004, American scholars Rysz and Alvarez (2004) considered ARGs as a new type of environmental pollutants. In 2006, Pruden et al. (2006) put forward ARGs as a new type of environmental pollutants, which has drawn more and more attention in the research field of environmental sciences. ARGs can spread and transfer between different bacteria and have more adverse effects on the environment than the ARGs themselves, which is one of the reasons for the growing pollution in the environment (Dodd, 2012, Jiao et al., 2017). In the meantime, increasing ARB has been detected in the environment. It has been reported that multiresistant New Delhi Metallo-\u03b2-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) emerges in wastewater of two STPs in Haihe River basin of China, and the ARGs of NDM-1 can transfer to the indigenous bacteria in the receiving river providing source water for millions of people nearby, which poses huge health risk (Luo et al., 2013). The purpose of this section is to thoroughly summarize the pollution status of ARGs and ARB in the wastewater and propose future research directions.",

            "text": "The research group of Professor Zhang from the University of Hong Kong conducted a detailed and deep research on the fate of ARGs in STPs. Tet(A), tet(C), tet(G), tet(M), tet(S), and tet(X) have been detected in all the 15 STPs across China, Canada, the United States, and Singapore (Zhang and Zhang, 2011). Yang et al. (2013) have investigated the variation of ARGs in activated sludge over a 4-year period, which revealed that more than 200 ARG subtypes have been detected in the activated sludge, and aminoglycoside and tetracycline resistance genes have highest abundances followed by sulfonamide, multidrug, and chloramphenicol resistance genes. On this basis, a total of 271 ARG subtypes within 18 ARG types were detectable in the influent, activated sludge, effluent, and anaerobic digestion sludge in a sewage treatment plant in Hong Kong from 2011 to 2012, and the abundance of ARGs was highest in influent followed by effluent, activated sludge, and anaerobic digestion sludge (Yang et al., 2014). Meanwhile, the research group also found 78 persistent ARGs in the process of biological wastewater and sludge treatment, revealing that anaerobic digestion of sludge cannot completely remove ARGs (Zhang et al., 2015). Furthermore, the abundance of ARGs is correlated with antibiotic resistance phenotypes in municipal sewage, and the abundance of ARGs in resistant coliforms is also relatively high and up to 33.8 \u00b1 4.2 copies per cell (Li et al., 2017).\n",

            "text": "The use of antibiotics in aquaculture system and livestock breeding could increase the potential risk of antibiotic resistance in products and ecosystems (He et al., 2016, Huang et al., 2015). Increasing studies have shown that aquaculture and animal farms are important sources of ARB and ARGs in the water environment, where ARB and ARGs are abundant and may infect humans through the food chain (Huang et al., 2015, Jia et al., 2017). Currently, antibiotic resistant pathogens such as Aeromonas (Penders and Stobberingh, 2008), Vibrio (Oh et al., 2011), and Salmonella (Budiati et al., 2013) have been found in aquaculture systems. A total of 4767 strains nonsusceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, tetracycline, erythromycin or cefotaxime were isolated from fish intestine, fish surface rinsing water, fish feed, pond mud, and pond water from an American aquaculture farm, and 80% of them exhibited multiple antibiotic resistance (Huang et al., 2015). Furthermore, strains of Escherichia coli were isolated in pigs and poultry in China which had high rates of resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline, doxycycline, trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, streptomycin, and chloramphenicol (Jiang et al., 2011). Notably, antibiotic resistance was observed in aquaculture and livestock breeding system as well as clinically isolated strains, indicating that potential antibiotic resistance could be transmitted between food and humans (Brooks et al., 2014, Huang et al., 2015). Xiong et al. (2015) found a total of 15 ARG subtypes (sulI, sulII, sulIII, tet(M), tet(O), tet(W), tet(S), tet(Q), tet(X), tet(B/P), qepA, oqxA, oqxB, aac(6\u2032)-Ib, and qnrS) within four ARG types (sulfonamide, tetracycline, aminoglycoside, and quinolone) in fresh water aquaculture environment and the relative abundance was up to 2.8 \u00d7 10\u22122 (ARG copy/16S rRNA copy). Tajbakhsh et al. (2015) collected 150 water samples from aquaculture water of fish fields in different geographical regions in Iran and found 18% of the water samples contained Escherichia coli resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and imipenem. Furthermore, Zhu et al. (2013) comprehensively evaluated the diversity and abundance of ARGs in a pig farm and detected a total of 149 ARG subtypes resistance to aminoglycoside, \u03b2-lactam, tetracycline, vancomycin, and other antibiotics. At the same time, their abundances significantly correlated with levels of antibiotics (Zhu et al., 2013). Quinolone-resistant genes qnrS and oqxA have been detected in pig farm wastewater using real-time quantitative PCR technology, and they have spread to the surrounding environment based on the comparison with the levels of them in the surrounding soil (Li et al., 2012a).",

A variety of biological HRPs are prevalent in wastewater, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, helminth, biotoxins, ARGs, and ARB. The biological HRPs in wastewater possibly contact with human bodies along with wastewater discharge into the environment or reuse for different purposes, which can induce serious infection to affect public health. Notably, some wastewater treatment processes have the potential to reduce the level of various biological HRPs and the induced risk on environment and health. However, due to the lack of reliable risk assessment methodology for the biological HRPs in the wastewater, whether the treated wastewater is safe enough for public health currently remains known. Thus, the health risk associated with these biological HRPs in the wastewater deserves greater concerns, and more efforts have to be devoted to extending our knowledge regarding their health hazards and risks and developing effective technologies to prevent, remove, or kill biological HRPs in the wastewater.",
