Prompt and aggressive therapy with long-term immunosuppressive medications and blood transfusions as needed are vital in the successful treatment of this condition.\n\n",

Three ferrets were also treated with systemic steroids that may have caused an altered immune status. In one case, dexamethasone SP was used to manage hind-end paresis.9 When the ferret was euthanized 5 weeks later, it had systemic cryptococcosis. In a case of chorioretinitis, the ferret was treated with oral prednisone.13, 14 This ferret was also treated with fluconazole at the same time, but when he was euthanized 7 months after treatment he had signs of systemic cryptococcosis.",

Combination use with AMB is still recommended for disseminated disease or CNS involvement.2 Itraconazole has been used in the treatment of 4 ferrets with localized disease7, 10, 12 and 1 with disseminated systemic disease.11 Fluconazole has been used in the treatment of 1 ferret with ocular cryptococcosis13, 14 and 1 that had localized disease to the hind limb (see Table 3).7\n",

In the 1930s the zoonotic spread of influenza from ferrets was first reported.31 More recently, ferrets have been instrumental in influenza research and as sentinels for this viral infection in humans. Ferrets are used as animal models for influenza infection because they display flulike symptoms and immune responses similar to those of humans.32 In Pennsylvania in 2009, the diagnosis of influenza in several pet ferrets led to enhanced surveillance for pandemic H1N1 in the region. This vigilance helped to increase the identification of humans infected with this same strain.28 Experimentally, reassortment of different strains of influenza in ferrets has been proved via coinfection with both a human and avian strain of the virus. Therefore, a ferret exposed to both a pathogenic and seasonal strain of influenza could act as mediator for the formation of a pathogenic form of the seasonal influenza.33\n",

Supportive care includes fluid therapy, either subcutaneously or intravenously, if severely dehydrated or febrile. Weight loss was a common clinical sign noted in ferrets experimentally infected with influenza, so support feeding is also important.24 Ferrets are strict carnivores with a rapid GI transit time, so a convalescent diet should include a meal that is palatable, and high in fat and protein. Many recovery diets for feline patients are suitable, such as Hill\u2019s A/D, Oxbow\u2019s Carnivore Care, or Lafeber\u2019s Emeraid Carnivore. Coverage with a broad-spectrum antibiotic is warranted if a secondary bacterial infection is suspected. Parenteral antibiotics can be used in ferrets that are too sick or nauseated for oral antibiotics. The use of antiviral drugs in the treatment of influenza is difficult, because this virus mutates and resistance is common.36 There are variable results in the use of antiviral drugs in experimentally induced influenza in ferrets, which seem to depend on the strain of the virus and the time of administration after infection.36, 37 In the ferrets with pandemic H1N1 influenza, many were successfully treated with subcutaneous fluids, parenteral antibiotics, and support feeding.27, 29, 30 It must be noted that influenza is zoonotic and contagious to other ferrets, so appropriate precautions must be taken for all staff and owners involved in treating the ill ferret.",

This condition is believed to be immune mediated, but the exact pathogenesis has not been elucidated. The presence of antithyroglobulin varies between breeds, and whether it occurs before or as a result of follicular damage is unknown. Idiopathic thyroid atrophy is characterized by the loss of the thyroid parenchyma and replacement with adipose connective tissue, with no observable inflammation or fibrosis.

More recently, however, T4 levels were measured using human recombinant TSH (Thyrogen) in 11 neutered ferrets, and successful stimulation of the thyroid axis was achieved. Prestimulation values for T4 in neutered male and female ferrets were determined to be 29.9 \u00b1 5.8 ng/mL and 21.8 \u00b1 3.3 ng/mL, respectively. Ferrets were stimulated using 100 \u03bcg Thyrogen intramuscularly, and euthyroid ferrets were found to have an increase of 1.4 times basal levels after 4 hours.38 A concurrent study involving 25 laboratory and pet neutered ferrets using the same protocol was also released in 2012. The investigators noted a median poststimulation T4 level at 34.8% above prestimulatory levels, and found the mean plasma T4 of euthyroid ferrets to be 21.3 nmol/L.42\n",

Anemia can also be a result of decreased red cell production, with lymphoma and renal disease as possible causes.

This disease differs from the typical appearance of IMHA, whereby there are normal to increased numbers of erythroblasts in the bone marrow. The singular loss of only the erythroid cell line and no changes in the myeloid or megakaryocytic cell lines results in a marked increase in the myeloid-to-erythroid ratio.

In the published case report, no evidence of regeneration (reticulocyte count of 0 cells/\u03bcL) was noted after 2 weeks of prednisolone (2 mg/kg orally every 12 hours) therapy alone.53 Improvement on prednisolone (2 mg/kg orally every 12 hours) was seen in 2 of the 4 cases (Case B and C) seen in the author\u2019s practice. Increases in PCV to near normal levels were noted within 4 to 5 weeks. However, relapse of the anemia was seen in 1 of the ferrets (Case B) while the prednisolone was being tapered. A third ferret (Case D) was already on prednisolone (0.75 mg/kg orally every 12 hours) for management of insulinomas when it presented for its anemia, though not at an immunosuppressive dose. In this particular ferret, his initial presentation of anemia was believed to be caused by hyperestrogenism secondary to confirmed hyperadrenocorticism, because the patient had a concurrent thrombocytopenia and its PCV increased from 18% to 51% within 4 weeks after surgery. The ferret\u2019s PCV remained in normal ranges until recurrence of the anemia was noted 13 weeks later. This second incidence was believed to be caused by PRCA, because no evidence of hyperestrogenism was noted 2 weeks prior on an adrenal sex hormone panel. Erythroid hypoplasia of the bone marrow was confirmed at necropsy. The PCV of the final ferret (Case A) continued to drop from 18% down to 10% over 2 weeks while receiving prednisolone, but it was most likely receiving a suboptimal dose (1 mg/kg orally every 12 hours) (see Table 4).",

The cyclosporine dosage was increased (6 mg/kg orally every 12 hours), and a significant increase in both reticulocyte number and trough plasma concentration of cyclosporine was noted within 5 days.

However, because azathioprine has delayed immunosuppressive effects, it most likely did not play a role in the ferret\u2019s regenerative response and was discontinued after less than a week.53 Cyclophosphamide, an alkylating agent used to treat various autoimmune conditions and cancer, has been used in dogs49 and cats50 for the treatment of PRCA. Although cyclophosphamide is used in chemotherapeutic protocols for lymphoma in ferrets,64 its use for treatment of PRCA in ferrets has not been documented. Antithymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab, rituximab, and intravenous immunoglobulin have been used in the treatment of acquired PRCA in humans, but their use in veterinary medicine has not been reported.51 Erythropoietin has been used in cases of canine and feline anemia associated with end-stage renal failure, but it has questionable benefits in patients with normal renal function.53, 65 In addition, the use of erythropoietin has been implicated in some cases of acquired PRCA in other species.49, 52 Although erythropoietin was administered to the ferret in the one published case report, it was not thought to be a factor in that ferret\u2019s remission. In other species, erythropoietin is effective only after administration for several weeks, and the ferret had a marked reticulocytosis within 5 days of initiating treatment with erythropoietin. The dosage of the ferret\u2019s cyclosporine had been increased at the same time and was thought to be the more likely cause of the regenerative response.53\n",

A partial and short-term response was noted in 1 ferret (Case B), but the nonregenerative anemia returned while in the process of weaning off the prednisolone.

The case in the juvenile ferret (Case A) had no response to immunosuppressive therapy and multiple blood transfusions, which may have been due to suboptimal dosing of the prednisolone (see Table 4).
