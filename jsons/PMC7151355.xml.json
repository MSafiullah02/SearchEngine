Methods of these studies have also been described in prior publications (7\u20139). In brief, recruitment procedures included identifying potentially eligible participants via electronic health record queries; sending them a letter describing the study; then telephoning any patients who did not opt out of being contacted to introduce the study, screen for eligibility, and schedule an in-person baseline interview. Common exclusion criteria for all studies include the presence of a severe and uncorrectable cognitive, visual, or hearing impairment that would preclude a participant's ability to complete interviews. For this survey, we targeted participants whose last interview was done between 2018 and the present. This time frame was selected to ensure that previously collected data from each parent study\u2014which were merged with data from this survey\u2014were most current; participants with the most recently collected prior data were prioritized for recruitment.",

Perceived concern for COVID-19 (more plainly called \u201ccoronavirus\u201d) was evaluated by first asking participants to rate, on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being no threat at all and 10 being very serious), how serious a public health threat they believed the coronavirus is or might become. In addition, a single question asked participants to rate their level of worry about getting the coronavirus (very worried, somewhat worried, a little worried, or not worried at all). To provide context, this same question was asked with regard to influenza, and participants were also asked whether they had received an influenza vaccine in the past year.",

Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate least-squares means (with 95% CIs) for the continuous outcome of perceived concern. For dichotomous outcomes, a multivariable Poisson distribution was used rather than odds ratios for the relative risk estimates (13). All models included health literacy as a primary covariate of interest, additional variables affecting knowledge and behavior (age, gender, race, and income), day the survey was done, and parent study.

Nearly one third could not identify symptoms or proper measures to prevent infection. Most respondents reported that the virus was affecting their daily routine and leading to changes in already made plans, yet 1 in 5 adults believed that it had little or no effect on their lives or plans.

When our C3 survey started on 13 March 2020, there were only 46 cases and no deaths; by the end of the survey on 20 March, there were 585 cases and 5 deaths. Across the United States and worldwide, the outbreak was increasing at a rate of 40% to 50% more new cases daily during the week of the interviews. At the same time, several measures were announced in succession: Schools began closing across Illinois, employers were sending staff home to work remotely, various public restrictions were implemented (bar and restaurant closures and limitations on gatherings), and ultimately a \u201cshelter at home\u201d order was announced. Thus, our findings provide a rare snapshot of how a cohort of mostly middle-aged and older adults with underlying health conditions adapted to this unprecedented time and took action, or not. Our study identified concerning demographic and socioeconomic differences in how individuals perceived the threat of COVID-19 and, perhaps, their own ability to take actions to prevent illness. Specifically, those who were black, were living below the poverty level, and had low health literacy were less likely to believe that they might become infected, and black respondents were less worried about the pandemic. Black adults also felt less prepared for an outbreak than white adults, and individuals with low health literacy reported not only being less prepared but also having more confidence in the federal government response.",

Trust in public health officials, information-seeking behaviors, sources of information, frequency of media exposure, knowledge, and worry related to the outbreak were all highlighted determinants of documented disparities in uptake of recommended behaviors. In our study, disparities by race, socioeconomic status, and health literacy were not reflected in ratings of the seriousness of the COVID-19 threat, demonstrated knowledge of its symptom presentation or general means to prevent it, or reported changes to daily routines and plans. Prior research has documented racial differences pertaining to trust in the health care system (15\u201317). For those who are living below the poverty level or have low health literacy, perceptions of personal risk and the ability to prevent infection may be limited. This may be due to feeling less able to change one's social circumstance, or lack of public health communications that are explicit and actionable and provide clear, efficacious messaging pertaining to recommended protective behaviors (18, 19). A previous report found socioeconomic and literacy disparities in mortality associated with the 1918 influenza pandemic; likewise, our findings should raise caution (20). Although the current public health infrastructure is different, existing efforts may not be adequately reaching these vulnerable populations.",

First, this survey was done among a selected group of patients who were all active participants in cohort studies or clinical trials sponsored by the National Institutes of Health in 1 large U.S. city. Thus, these findings may have limited generalizability, especially for younger adults and those without underlying health conditions. However, our study samples purposefully include men and women who are socioeconomically, racially, and ethnically diverse and are at greatest risk for COVID-19 because of age and underlying conditions. Second, to rapidly implement our investigation and quickly recruit as large a sample as possible during the first of multiple waves of interviews, we were limited in the depth of our survey and number of items to use. Prior research on virus outbreaks guided our selection and creation of survey items (12), but we lacked the time or opportunity to validate all questions, particularly in the midst of a public health crisis. However, items followed best practices for the design of assessments for use among persons with lower literacy (21). Third, our outcomes capture only initial awareness of COVID-19, degree of worry, fundamental knowledge, attitudes, and a limited set of behaviors. Understanding of the virus has since evolved, and we could not expand on those developments. Items included in planned follow-up waves of the survey will adapt accordingly and expand data capture on behaviors, among other just-in-time topics.",
