SARS-CoV-2 may reach the brainstem through a neural route from lung chemoreceptors, severely affecting the cardiorespiratory center (Li et al. 2020a). This suggests that the acute respiratory failure in some COVID-19 patients may have a central origin (Li et al. 2020a). SARS-CoV-2 may also injure olfactory nerve terminals in the nasal cavity, explaining both the anecdotal and the recently published observations of associated decreased sense of smell in COVID-19 patients (Yeager 2020a; Rabin 2020; Lechien et al. 2020). It is of note that olfactory deficits have been previously reported for several viral infections including coronavirus (Suzuki et al. 2007), and are characteristic of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases (Marin et al. 2018).",

ARBs reduce inflammation and endothelial and epithelial dysfunction in many organs including the lung, protecting its endothelial barrier integrity (Fedson 2016). There is substantial clinical evidence indicating that ARBs protect the lung from severe injury associated to pneumonia, sepsis, influenza, and chronic pulmonary disease, improving overall pulmonary health (Fedson 2016; Mortensen et al. 2012; Soto et al. 2017; Kim et al. 2016; Chang et al. 2015) and reduce SARS coronavirus-induced lung injury (Kuba et al. 2005). Furthermore, mortality was reduced in patients previously treated with ARBs for cardiovascular disorders and later hospitalized for pneumonia (Fedson 2016). Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that ARBs may ameliorate pneumonia in COVID-19 patients, since recent studies have reported that ARBs improve the overall clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients with hypertension (Meng et al. 2020).",

This proposal is substantiated by the report of marked increases in Angiotensin II plasma levels in COVID-19 patients, linearly associated to viral load and lung injury (Liu et al. 2020b). These observations strongly suggested that RAS activity was enhanced and AT1 receptors were overstimulated in these patients, probably as the result of direct effects of SARS-CoV-2, critical worsening of overall tissue inflammation and COVID-19 comorbidities, associated with intense mental and physical stress. Based on these findings, it has been recommended to repurpose ARBs as part of the therapeutic arsenal for COVID-19 (Liu et al. 2020b; Gurwitz 2020). A recent article published in The Scientist and based on interviews with experts in the field summarized the rationale for the use of ARBs as COVID-19 treatment (Yeager 2020b), and a recent article already describes in detail the beneficial effects of ARB therapy in COVID-19 patients (Liu et al. 2020a).",

This recommendation was widely echoed in social media. The authors based their recommendation on the discovery that ARBs upregulate ACE2, a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, and they hypothesize that ARBs may enhance viral uptake and virulence, without offering any evidence that this may be the case. Neither Diaz (2020) nor Fang et al. (2020) considered the substantial literature demonstrating that enhanced ACE2 expression is protective, not only for the lung but also for other organs. Fang et al. (2020) argued that ARBs may be replaced by other antihypertensives such as calcium-blocking agents, without considering that these compounds lack the pleiotropic protective characteristics of ARBs. Abruptly replacing ARBs in patients affected with hypertension, heart failure, or previous myocardial infarct with other medications may expose the patients to significant risks and may worsen their prognosis (Vaduganathan et al. 2020). A detailed rebuttal of Diaz (2020) and Fang et al. (2020) recommendations has been recently published elsewhere (Saavedra 2020). Recommendations not to withdraw ARBs when medically prescribed have been echoed in several recent publications (Gurwitz 2020; Patel and Verma 2020; South et al. 2020).",

ACE2 cleaves Angiotensin II into Ang (1\u20137), part of the ACE2/Angiotensin (1\u20137)/Mas axis, a proposed protective mechanism balancing RAS overstimulation, and this system is stimulated by ARBs (Ren et al. 2019).

Furthermore, ACE2 not only cleaves circulating Angiotensin II but also hydrolyses several peptides such as dynorphin, apelin, and bradykinin (Warner et al. 2004). The pathophysiological significance of these relationships has not been fully investigated.",

            "text": "\nWell-regarded clinical studies demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus affects the function of many organs besides the lung, including the brain. Neurological examinations are needed for all patients infected with SARS-CoA-2, whether symptomatic for COVID-19 or not, and certainly during hospitalization. COVID-19 patients should be considered a group at higher risk for brain disorders, even after recovery from the disease. Long-term neurologic follow-up after recovery from COVID-19 will reveal whether this illness is associated with neurodegenerative conditions susceptible of early treatment. Mental health support should be offered to COVID-19 patients and their families after recovery from the critical stage of their illness.It has been conclusively demonstrated that treatment with ARBs protects patients and ameliorates the consequences of cerebral, cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal disorders that later become frequent COVID-19 comorbidities. ARBs have been shown to protect lung function, reduce the severity of pneumonia, and alleviate chronic pulmonary disease. These findings strongly support not to discontinue ARB treatment when medically prescribed. Abrupt ARB withdrawal in these patients will expose them to a significant risk of serious complications.To definitely answer the recommendations to withdraw ARB treatment from patients already medicated with ARBs for cardiovascular and other disorders, we would need additional studies, many of them already under way. First, we need clear and conclusive evidence that ARB treatment does not predispose patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Are patients under ARB treatment less likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2? To answer this question, we would need population studies and data analysis to establish that the patient population treated with ARBs is not at higher, but instead at lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, are patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 more likely to be asymptomatic if they have been previously treated with ARBs? The answers to these questions will require clinical studies and data analysis not presently under consideration.At present, even more pressing studies are under way to determine the effect of previous ARB treatment that has been continued during hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. The presence or absence of ARB therapy in COVID-19 patients is now carefully documented and monitored in many clinical centers, including determination of ARB protection against COVID-19-induced hypertension. We need to conclusively determine whether continuation of ARB treatment in COVID-19 non-hospitalized or hospitalized patients is beneficial, reducing progression, accelerating recovery, and decreasing mortality. Several preliminary analyses demonstrate that ARBs reduce the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients (see details in the text) and more definitive results are likely to be published momentarily. These data analysis will also discover whether discontinuation of ARB therapy prior to COVID-19 diagnosis influences the progression of the disease.A most important question remaining is whether de novo ARB administration to COVID-19 patients could be therapeutically efficacious. There are at present (04-28-2020) at least 24 new carefully designed controlled clinical trials looking at de novo ARB administration to COVID-19 patients testing this hypothesis and including the effects of discontinuation of ARB therapy in COVID-19 patients. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&term=angiotensin+receptor+blockers&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=While clinical studies as the ones described above are of immediate value, experimental research will be needed to clarify the effects of ARBs on SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cells and its virulence, and to establish the effects of ARBs not only on ACE2 but also on other coronavirus co-receptors and on associated signal transduction mechanisms.\n",

If we obtain a clear, definitive, and accepted demonstration that ARBs are not harmful but rather protective against COVID-19, instead of withdrawing these medicines from those affected with hypertension and other possible COVID-19 comorbidities, ARBs should be included in the therapeutic arsenal of patients not currently treated with these compounds.",
