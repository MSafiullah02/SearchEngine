A novel SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was found to be the infectious agent and its genome has been completely sequenced (Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003a, Peiris et al., 2003b). SARS-CoV, an enveloped virus, replicates itself in the cytoplasm of its host cells. Its single-stranded, plus-sense RNA genome is structurally quite distinct from other coronaviruses known to infect humans or animals on the basis of their genomic sequences. Its open reading frames at the 3\u2032-end encode four major structural proteins: spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) protein, envelope (E) glycoprotein and nucleocapsid (N) protein (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). Many aspects of SARS are still unclear; therefore, accurate diagnosis and efficient vaccines are vital for controlling this deadly disease.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV S protein, a large membrane glycoprotein of 1255 amino acids (aa), has been found to be responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been shown to possess the functional receptor for the SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003). The conformational changes induced by the complex of S protein and its receptor are required for membrane fusion (Dimitrov, 2003, Li et al., 2003, Wang et al., 2004). Furthermore, the high antigenicity of the S protein can efficiently elicit neutralizing antibody in mice in protecting them from infection (Bisht et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004). Those results suggest that S protein is a good target for vaccine development, antiviral therapies and diagnostic application. Therefore, generating monoclonal antibodies specifically to recognize the S protein is needed. However, we have to overcome the difficulties associated with the traditional approach in generating monoclonal antibodies. Alternatively, the choice of the phage display system is a safe and effective in vitro procedure to enrich specific antibodies from large synthetic phage antibody libraries (Barbas et al., 1991). Domestic chicken is the simplest and easily available host choice for single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody library construction to screen efficient binders against various pathogen infections (Fehrsen et al., 2005, Finlay et al., 2006, Park et al., 2005).",

Briefly, 7 days following the final immunization, chickens were euthanized and spleens were harvested. Spleens were placed immediately in Trizol reagent for homogenization. The extraction of total RNAs was carried out and 10 \u03bcg of RNAs was reversely transcribed to synthesize the first-strand cDNA using a SuperScript RT kit (Invitrogen). After PCR amplification with chicken specific primers, we obtained gene products of heavy and light chain variable regions (VH and VL). For full-length single chain (sc) Fv construction, we connected VH and VL fragments with a peptide linker (GGSSRSS) by an overlap extension PCR, which was further cloned into a pComb3H vector. The recombinant DNAs were transformed into E. coli XL-1 strain by electroporation. Recombinant phage production was initiated by the addition of helper phage VCS-M13 (Barbas et al., 1991), precipitated with 4% polyethylglycol 8000 and 3% NaCl (w/v), resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and stored at 4 \u00b0C.",

In the primary PCR, VH and VL gene were amplified as 400 and 350 bp in size, respectively. Difference in intensity was observed, which may reflect variation in the gene expression and biased amplification efficiency intrinsic to each chicken (data not shown). Thereafter, a library (4S) containing about 5 \u00d7 107 clones was constructed. Restriction analysis of 10 randomly chosen clones from the library indicated that 8/10 (80%) of clones contained scFv gene inserts (data not shown). The SARS-CoV S protein-specific binders were enriched by four rounds of panning. Then, individual phage clones were amplified and analyzed for their binding activity by phage ELISA. The results in Fig. 4\nshowed that the randomly chosen phage clones exhibited significant binding activity (OD between 0.7 and 1.2) and six clones showed intermediate level of binding activity (OD between 0.4 and 0.6) against SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cell lysates. In control samples, both wild-type M13 phage and irrelevant scFv-expressing phage showed weak reactivity (OD below 0.2). Accordingly, three highly and two moderately positive clones, including 4S1, 4S3, 4S4, 4S12 and 4S15, were further characterized. To understand the scFv gene diversity of these clones, VL and VH genes were sequenced by two designed sense primers (Barbas et al., 2001). After aligning with the chicken germline gene, the five chosen clones revealed 6\u201312% and 31\u201362% variation in framework (FR) and CDR regions, respectively, leading to a 13\u201325% mutation rate in the entire V region (Fig. 5\nand Table 2\n).",

Nevertheless, all negative controls, including normal human serum (Fig. 6B), pre-immunized serum (Fig. 6D) and wild M13 phage (Fig. 6F), exhibited no or little binding signal.

At lower enrichment levels, nonspecific and weak affinity binders could cause outgrowth in the output phages after amplification. The observation by Barbas et al. (1991) is consistent with our phage ELISA result, i.e. that the affinity in more than half of the chosen clones was weak. In this study, we recognized the potential problems in selecting processes, especially to get a specific phage clone with efficient binding ability against the S protein. The result in our panning process showed an increase after the third cycle, although the phage output slightly dropped in the second round (data not shown).

Our mapping results showed that fragments Se-e (aa 456\u2013650), Sf-f (aa 600\u2013800) and Sg-g (aa 750\u20131000), reacting with 70, 70 and 100% of patients\u2019 sera, respectively (Table 1), covered most potential epitopic regions reported elsewhere (Chou et al., 2005, Greenough et al., 2005, He et al., 2004, Hua et al., 2005, Ren et al., 2003, Wang et al., 2005, Zhi et al., 2005). We also identified, for the first time, an additional, highly antigenic fragment Sb-b (aa 150\u2013400), which was recognized by 70% of patients\u2019 sera. Notably, the carboxyl terminus of fragment Sb-b in a receptor-binding region of S protein is responsible for SARS-CoV infection to its host cells (Li et al., 2003, van den Brink et al., 2005). Moreover, fragment Sg-g, which is recognized by all the examined sera, overlaps with a neutralizing domain located at residues 797\u20131192. This domain, which has been previously reported, can induce a protective antibody response against SARS-CoV infection (Chou et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2005). Taken together, we suggest that these E. coli-derived truncated S fragments are excellent targets for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.",

Of the various recombinant antibody formats, scFv is the most commonly used because not only can be rapidly constructed and well-expressed in E. coli, but it also has high affinity and relative stability (Bird et al., 1988, Huston et al., 1988). Among all diagnostic tests, the phage-based method is relatively easy to perform and can be adopted as a quick test for screening many laboratory samples (Lee et al., 2006). Using specific biotin-tagged phage conjugated with streptavidin-coated quantum-dot, it has the power to detect as few as 10 cells/ml (Edgar et al., 2006). In this study, we found that 4S1 posessed the greatest binding ability detected on both phage ELISA and immunocytochemical staining when 1010\u20131011 phage particles were used. Lu et al. (2004) have previously developed an ELISA assay using phage particles, which is about 100 times more sensitive than the conventional immune-absorbent assay. Our results are comparable to those obtained by Lu et al. (2004), indicating that 4S1 phage is a suitable candidate for developing a phage-based diagnostic assay.",

The purification process to mass produce IgY with stable, specific poly-IgY activity in eggs is simple (Mine and Kovacs-Nolan, 2002), but monoclonal antibodies are needed to obtain higher specificity. In the chicken antibody gene, both the light and heavy chains have single V and J regions (heavy chain has an additional D region). Based on single VL and VH genes in chicken immunoglobulins, researchers have found that one set of antibody gene primers is convenient for library construction (Andris-Widhopf et al., 2000, Davies et al., 1995). Using this distinctive feature, we have rearranged and generated a diverse antibody repertoire from chicken. To our knowledge, we are the first to use chicken in generating a scFv library directed against the SARS-CoV S protein. After comparing the findings in sequence analysis of chosen phage clones with chicken germline, we found large dissimilarities, typically in the CDR regions of both VL and VH (Fig. 5), revealing a 31\u201357% and 48\u201362% mutation rate, respectively (Table 2). Gearhart and Bogenhagen (1983) reported somatic hypermutations to increase antibody affinity occurred more often in the CDR than FR regions of the rearranged V gene. Thus, the Ig genes of our chosen clones from hyperimmunized chickens had accumulated more mutations in CDR regions as a result of affinity selection of B cells.",
