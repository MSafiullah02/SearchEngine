These estimates have been challenged by recent reports of an overall COPD prevalence of 3.0% (30 per 1000 people aged \u2265 15 years) in three regions of China.\n8\n The WHO/World Bank study also estimated a COPD prevalence of 2.89/1000 in males and 1.79/1000 in females in 1990 for \u2018other Asia and Islands\u2019 (an amalgam of 49 countries and island states in the Asia\u2013Pacific region).\n1\n, \n2\n Furthermore, data from that study were used to extrapolate a COPD prevalence figure of 3.8% (38 per 1000 people) for the entire Asian population.\n3\n These estimates, which are not necessarily based on actual epidemiological data, do not provide reliable information about the precise prevalence of COPD in the Asia\u2013Pacific region. This in turn means that governments are unaware of the regional economic and human impact of COPD, and are, therefore, unable to plan effective strategies for reducing the burden of disease.",
