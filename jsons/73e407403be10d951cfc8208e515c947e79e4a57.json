Detention settings are extremely susceptible to rapid and disastrous spread of infectious disease, owing to both environmental and host factors-a point extensively documented by the historical spread of influenza, tuberculosis, and other respiratory pathogens. 1, 2 The U.S. holds almost 2.3 million people, exceeding 0.7% of its total population, in state and federal prisons, local jails, immigration detention centers, juvenile correctional facilities, military prisons, and state hospitals. 3 These settings are extremely diverse in terms of size and organization, but they are congregate settings where prisoners cannot leave and are generally 3 unable to maintain \"social distancing.\" Prison staff enter and exit on a daily basis, and prisoners are regularly transferred between facilities. There is also a \"jail churn\" of admissions and releases from local jails, acting as a powerful \"transmission multiplier\" among the 7.3 million total (3.2% of adults) who are incarcerated each year. 2 Prisoners have a high prevalence of chronic disease and mental health illness, and prisons house an increasingly aging population, which will contribute directly to higher rates of severe viral illness and death. 4 Educational attainment and health literacy tend to be low and information transfer is tightly controlled, creating fertile ground for misinformation and fear. 5 Essential interventions, such as isolation and quarantine, will likely worsen pre-existing mental health diagnoses. 6 The correctional environment imposes additional risk. 1, 7 Overcrowding, poor ventilation, close habitation, or dormitory-style housing will increase COVID-19 transmission. Also, institutions strictly control everyday items such as soap, cleaning supplies, and hand sanitizer, and rarely provide spare clothing or bedding. These practices can lead to poor personal hygiene and may also contribute to virus spread.",

They constitute millions of family members and neighbors, and as such, their safety is inherently a matter of public health. Today, correctional workers and prisoners are under severe threat, but when correctional institutions and the outside community collaborate for the safety of their workers and residents, all will be better protected against COVID-19 illness and death.",

They should seek collaboration with experts from the American College of Correctional Physicians, American Correctional Association, or National Commission on Correctional Health Care, and observe published guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 1 and the WHO. 20 The most important recommendations are listed below: \u2022 Coordinate with local public health. Correctional and public health systems must coordinate individual responsibilities throughout the outbreak. Preventive medicine physicians and public health departments should assist with pandemic plan creation and implementation as appropriate for each correctional setting. Policy changes should be considered to facilitate active oversight of these facilities. \u2022 Coordinate between correctional facilities. Arrange for sharing of information, physical resources, or transfer of prisoners. Maintain contact throughout the outbreak. \u2022 Identify, treat. Screen all prisoners and staff on entry. Urge symptom reporting from prisoners and staff. Establish clear, evidence-based policies for symptomatic individuals and ensure testing availability for prisoners and staff. Eliminate medical copays for prisoners. \u2022 Release prisoners, decrease admissions. Decrease intakes and utilize alternatives to incarceration such as community monitoring. Employ compassionate release for elderly and infirm prisoners. Expedite release or furlough of prisoners who pose relatively low public safety risks, including nearly all people in immigrant detention. Identify prisoners at higher risk of homelessness, unemployment, substance abuse, or becoming victims of 9 violence and arrange for appropriate resources, including medications for addiction treatment, at discharge. \u2022 Improve sanitation. Provide soap and tissue at no cost to prisoners and relax restrictions on hand sanitizer. Ensure adequate personal protective equipment. Increase laundry services. \u2022 Employ social distancing. Establish clear policies for social distancing and criteria for escalation based on likely transmission. Restrict transfers, medical appointments, or court appearances to those that are absolutely necessary. Assign housing to permit more space between prisoners. Establish separate spaces for isolation and quarantine; these should not resemble conditions of solitary confinement. \u2022 Plan for staff absences. Identify critical functions and cross-train coworkers. Retain additional contingency staff. Provide longer-term prescriptions for prisoners to keep on person. Make sick leave and medical coverage available for quarantined and infected staff. \u2022 Support mental health. Communicate situation reports clearly and often. Provide education to all stakeholders, including prisoners. Train staff to recognize burnout in colleagues and agitation in prisoners. Provide mental health support, modified schedules, or assignments to staff as able. Avoid lockdown if possible. Provide prisoners with additional activities and increased access to communication with their families.",
