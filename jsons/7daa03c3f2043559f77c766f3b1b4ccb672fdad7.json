In 1998 the EV infection caused 78 deaths and 405 severe cases in Taiwan (Ho et al. 1999) . Early detection of outbreaks is important for timely public health response to reduce morbidity and mortality. By early detecting the aberration of diseases, sanitarians can study or research into the causes of diseases as soon as possible and prevent the cost of the society and medical treatments. Traditional disease-reporting surveillance mechanisms might not detect outbreaks in their early stages because laboratory tests usually take long time to confirm diagnoses.",

Since the Shewhart chart is insensitive at detecting small shifts, CUSUM and exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) charts are more commonly used in public health surveillance than the Shewhart chart. Hutwagner et al. (1997) developed a computer algorithm based the CUSUM chart to detect salmonella outbreaks by using the laboratory-based data. Morton et al.

The result shows that Shewhart and EWMA work well for bacteremia and multiresistant organism rates surveillance and that CUSUM and Shewhart charts are suitable for monitoring surgical infection. Rogerson and Yamada (2004) applied a Poisson CUSUM chart to detect the lower respiratory tract infections for 287 census tracts simultaneously. Cowling et al. (2006) adopted the CUSUM chart with 7-week buffer interval for monitoring influenza data form Hong Kong and the United States and compared with time series and regression models. Woodall et al.
