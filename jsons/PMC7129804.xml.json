There are numerous causes of chronic renal disease in rabbits, but some are primarily identified only in laboratory animals, for example, feeding of diets with excessive vitamin D and calcium. Other causes include urolithiasis, bacterial infections, neoplasia, and nephrocalcinosis.2\n",

Many older rabbits manage to avoid acquired dental disease and possess essentially normal, continually renewing teeth well into old age. Other older rabbits may develop varying patterns of dental disease apparently related to slowing or cessation of tooth growth, which may be due to attrition of the alveolus. Severe acquired dental disease, however, is primarily a disease of younger rabbits; in these patients, evidence of dental disease is often apparent before 3 years of age.1 Accurate diagnosis and excellent owner compliance can result in adequate disease management and acquisition of normal expected life span; in many cases these patients eventually die of diseases unrelated to those of dentition. The author and others frequently see geriatric rabbits that have had years of regular dental care. In some cases all teeth are eventually lost, and patients survive with good to excellent quality of life on a diet of liquid Critical Care (Oxbow Animal Health, Murdoch, NE). Diagnosis and treatment of dental disease is presented in great detail elsewhere.1\n",
