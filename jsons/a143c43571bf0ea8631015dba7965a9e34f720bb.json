We aim to review the existing literature from low-and middle-income countries in regard to management of those newborns and the possible approaches to improve their outcomes. Methods A review of the existing English literature was conducted with the aim of assessing challenges faced by providers in LMIC in terms of diagnostic, preoperative, operative and post-operative care for TEF patients. We also review the limited literature for performing thoracoscopic repair in the developing world context and suggest methods for introduction of advanced thoracoscopic procedures including techniques for providing anesthesia to these challenging babies. Results While outcomes related to technique from LMIC are comparable to the developed world, rates of secondary complications like sepsis and pneumonia are higher. In many areas, repairs are conducted in a staged fashion with minimal utilization of thoracoscopic approach. The paucity of resources creates strain on intraoperative and post-operative management. Conclusion Clearly, not all developing world contexts are ready to attempt thoracoscopic repair but we outline suggestions for assessing the existing capabilities and a stepwise gradual implementation of advanced thoracoscopy when appropriate.",

Infants presenting late are at a higher risk of developing aspiration pneumonia [5, 6] . A baby referred from an outside hospital, a history of contrast study, and/or a history of attempts at oral feeding have been associated with aspiration pneumonia and should prompt heightened suspicion and further investigation. Managing aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics prior to surgical intervention has shown to be efficacious in increasing survival [5] . Efforts for these vulnerable babies could include increasing awareness 1 3 of EA among pediatricians and advising against using contrast studies along with establishing prompt referral guidelines. The lack of continuous suction in facilities also contributes to higher rates of aspiration pneumonia [5] . One study suggested compensation by placing the babies in lateral or prone position with repeated suction by oral mucus aspirator or by syringe [7] if infrastructure upgrades are impossible. One can speculate that the frequency of suctioning will depend on the quantity of the oral secretions and that in such a scenario, intensive and one-to-one nursing care is of utmost importance. Another area of concern is perioperative nutritional optimization. While TPN might be the standard in the developed countries, securing an IV access and the availability of TPN is a major hurdle in many developing countries. As in developed countries, patients with long gap esophageal atresia can benefit from placement of a gastrostomy tube before surgical interventions.",

            "text": "Lastly, birth weight is still an issue in LMIC. Some authors suggested that much of the literature reported from developed countries advocates abandoning the birth weight parameter from the Waterston classification, as it does not predict survival of patients with EA. Unfortunately, this does not hold true in LMICs [2, 8, 13] . We believe that a case-by-case approach with insight into one's personal and institutional limitations is needed to address birth weightrelated mortality and to achieve a balance between speedy intervention and avoidance of causing harm in the interest of expediency. For example, an option to allow for growth and decrease potential morbidity and mortality is performing a fistula ligation with insertion of a gastrostomy tube followed by definitive repair at an appropriate weight if proper options exist for management of the upper pouch secretions. There are multiple situations at which the above scenario will be appropriate. An unstable neonate unable to tolerate mechanical ventilation due to a large TEF would be better served with an emergent fistula ligation and delayed esophageal repair. It is an appropriate intraoperative decision in patients with long gap esophageal atresia with inability to perform an anastomosis with undue tension. Other indications not infrequently encountered in LMIC are to temporize a neonate born at a facility lacking infrastructure for post-operative management of those patients. Finally, fistula ligation with gastrostomy tube placement can be used with very low birth weight neonates until a target weight is reached. Surgeon experience, non-surgical service support (anesthesia, neonatology, etc.), and equipment availability should determine the optimal weight at a particular institution.",

Reports from Asia and the Middle East [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] show that thoracoscopic repair has been attempted but are still on the learning curve and only attempting thoracoscopic repair to infants with birth weights above 1.5 kg. While some studies reported longer operative time (175-230 min) [20, 22] , others were within the ranges reported from developed countries (120-150 min) [21] . Technical difficulties and a steep learning curve are frequently cited limiting factors in adopting thoracoscopic repair. Some suggested solutions from surgeons in LMIC are (1) introducing a thoracoscope through a minithoracotomy to learn the videoscopic anatomy and attempting the first few steps of the procedure with thoracoscopic instruments as a first step in the learning curve [21] , (2) interdisciplinary team discussion between the pediatric surgery team and the anesthesia team to avoid cases of conversion, (3) mastering advanced laparoscopic suturing skills in other laparoscopic neonatal procedures before performing this procedure [18] . However, it is our opinion that, in the hands of surgeons facile with advanced minimally invasive surgery, with proper safeguards, preparation, and counseling of the patient, it is reasonable to attempt thoracoscopic repair in the right developing world context. Ideally, a surgeon experienced with the approach should be present and each case should be approached with a low threshold for conversion to open.",

Incidence of critical intraoperative events during repair of EA/TEF is significantly higher in infants with associated cardiac pathology; when compared to nonductal-dependent lesions, presence of ductal-dependent cardiac lesions increase risk of mortality from 10 to 57% [25] .

            "text": "Airway management often presents the greatest intraoperative challenge during EA/TEF repair. Many EA/TEF patients have decreased lung compliance, often from prematurity or recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Initiation of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation in this patient population can lead to gastric distention. Gastric distention can cause reflux and aspiration of gastric contents, causing pneumonitis. Additionally, the resulting increased intraabdominal pressure decreases venous return, restricts diaphragmatic excursion, and decreases pulmonary compliance. While gastric decompression (either by needle gastrostomy by the surgeon at time of anesthetic induction or by opening a previously placed feeding tube) can prevent life-threatening gastric rupture, it may cause further ventilatory instability by providing a low-pressure leak via a \"bronchocutaneous\" fisula, with resultant ineffective ventilation [26] . For these reasons, maintaining spontaneous ventilation is preferred during the induction of general anesthesia in this patient population. This can be achieved by volatile anesthetics, or intravenous agents if access has already been secured. If intravenous agents are chosen for induction, great care must be taken to maintain spontaneous ventilation until easy bag-mask ventilation is demonstrated. Many surgeons will perform rigid bronchoscopy to further characterize the airway, to examine the fistula (and check for additional airway abnormalities). This is usually performed after induction but prior to placement of an endotracheal tube. It is safest to maintain spontaneous ventilation for this portion of the procedure. Neuromuscular blockade is usually avoided. If muscle paralysis is desired, it is extremely important to ensure that controlled bag-mask ventilation can be achieved without gastric distention first.",

In the case of endobronchial, one-lung ventilation, the endotracheal tube can be positioned in the right or left main stem bronchus until the fistula is ligated surgically, then withdrawn into the trachea for the remainder of the procedure. Given the difficulty of ventilating the right upper lobe (even with careful positioning of the Murphy eye), left mainstem intubation is often preferred. One lung ventilation offers the surgical advantage for less movement of the operative field for thoracoscopic or open repairs. However, a patient with preexisting lung disease from chronic aspiration or respiratory distress syndrome of prematurity may not tolerate single lung ventilation. When possible, for small/proximal tracheal fistulas, the endotracheal tube can be advanced just distal to the fistula, allowing for ventilation of both lungs. An endotracheal tube without a Murphy eye and positioning of the bevel to face anteriorly will maximize occlusion of the fistula [27] . Extreme care should be taken to prevent migration of the endotracheal tube into or past the fistula, which can cause life-threatening desaturation [28] . Other endotracheal tube positions can be tailored to the nature of the particular patient's anatomy. For example, one case report described placing a standard oral endotracheal tube placed just distal to the fistula, with the tip of the tube in the right bronchus, and the Murphy eye ventilating the left lung [29] . Intraoperative bronchoscopy is extremely helpful in positioning, but if unavailable in LMIC, the tip of the tracheal tube can be positioned just above the carina by auscultation of diminished breath sounds over the left axilla as the tube is advanced in to the right mainstem bronchus, after which the tube is retracted until breath sounds are once again increased over the left chest [30] .",

The authors suggest a realistic assessment of the capabilities of each individual institution including the patient referred, instrumentation available, surgeon experience, anesthetic capabilities and comfortability, post-operative intensive care, and subspecialty support. If the context allows, a gradual introduction of advanced minimally invasive repair can be attempted in the developing world.",
