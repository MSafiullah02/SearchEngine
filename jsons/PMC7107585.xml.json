It also concluded that climate change will continue to increase the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation events globally and the risk of drought in the Mediterranean region specifically (medium confidence). Climate change is a long-term process, but the extent to which individual weather events are influenced by climate change can increasingly be estimated.2,3",

These include studies of the extent to which `temperature and precipitation\u2019 are associated with out-migration. For example, in recent decades, temperature had a statistically significant effect on out-migration from agriculture-dependent countries.35 There is a nexus between climate change and migration in that temperature and precipitation are positively associated with migration: a 1\u00b0C increase in average temperature in the sending country is associated with a 1.9% increase in bilateral migration flows; an additional millimeter of average annual precipitation is associated with an increase in migration of 0.5%.36 Another study suggests that an increase in precipitation anomalies from the long-term mean may also be associated with an increase in out-migration.37 Under a moderate climate change scenario, if global mean temperature rises by 2\u00b0C, tropical populations would have to move considerable distances in order find places where temperatures are similar to those in places they currently live in and to preserve their annual mean temperatures.38",

For example, following Hurricane Katrina, it was estimated that between 37% and 54% of the population returned,41 with young adults being more likely to have moved further away.41,42 In 1992, after Hurricane Andrew in Florida, 76% of displaced residents relocated within the same county, 18% moved within the state and 6% moved out of state.43",

There is also a clear benefit from ensuring that migrants are included in vaccination programmes and providing catch-up vaccinations where needed (Table 5). Particular attention should be given to vulnerable children, women and the elderly, who might also suffer from non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, chronic lung diseases, mental health74 and trauma. Sudden migration can result in complications from non-communicable diseases if treatment and care are discontinued or if access to medications is interrupted.

Ambient temperature may also facilitate environmental growth of resistant strains and enhance transmission from food, agriculture and environmental sources.89",

For example, ballast from cargo ships played a role in moving pathogenic Vibrios to new locations that were environmentally and climatically suitable, even in northern latitudes.101 Travel and tourism can also facilitate the importation of pathogens from developed countries with low vaccination coverage, to developing countries with high rates of susceptible individuals due to lack of health care access.102,103",
