By considering the early phase in which the number of registered cases begins to exceed 100, we aimed at accounting for super-spreading events that are implausible when the number of infected individuals is very low. To provide additional motivation for this approach, we show that in the presence of superspreaders the median trajectory starting from a single infection grows much slower than the average trajectory, which very likely leads to overestimation of the doubling time. We used a susceptibleexposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model with six subsequent exposed states to reproduce the shape of the reported distribution of the incubation period. This allowed us to determine a plausible range of R 0 at 4.4-11.7, considerably higher than most initial estimates.",

In the case when the ratio of registered to removed individuals is increasing over time, the true increase of the removed cases may be overestimated.

Simulations were performed in the perfectly mixed regime according to the Gillespie algorithm. We assumed that a predefined fixed proportion of individuals has higher infectiousness and as such is responsible for on average either half of infections ('super-spreaders') or two-third of infections ('hyper-spreaders'). To reproduce these fractions in systems with different assigned proportions of super-or hyper-spreaders, their infectiousness is assumed to be inversely proportional to their ratio in the simulated population. We estimated T d in two ways: based on one month of growth of the number of new cases since the first registered case ('30 days since the 1 s t case') and based on growth of new cases in the two-week period after the number of registered cases exceeds 100 ('14 days since 100 cases'). As we are interested in the initial phase characterized by exponential growth, we assumed that the susceptible population remains constant. infectiousness has been reduced to give the same deterministic T d = 2 days (vertical dotted gray lines). Remaining model parameters: (m, n) = (6, 1); (1/\u03c3, 1/\u03b3) = (5.28 days, 3 days). Each histogram results from 5,000 stochastic simulations, each starting from a single infected normal individual; trajectories resulting in outbreak failure were discarded. Each distribution is described in terms of its mean (\u00b5), median (Q 2 and vertical dashed lines), and standard deviation (s.d.).",

One may observe that the histograms calculated using the '30 days since the 1 s t case' method are broader than those calculated using the '14 days since 100 cases' method, and the width of all histograms increases with increasing infectiousness (which is set inversely proportional to \u03c1). When T d is calculated using the '14 days since 100 cases' method, its median value is slightly larger than T d in the deterministic model (equal 2 days); however, when T d is calculated using the '30 days since the 1 s t case' method, then for high infectiousness of super-and hyper-spreaders (correspondingly, for low \u03c1) its median value becomes much larger than the deterministic T d . In the case of the lowest considered \u03c1 = 1%, when super-spreaders (hyper-spreaders) have their infectiousness about 100 times (200 times) higher than the infectiousness of normal individuals , one obtains median T d that is overestimated by 28% (67%). Both methods statistically overestimate T d but when using the '30 days since the 1 s t case' method, overestimation is very significant. The effect is caused by low probability of appearance of super-or ultra-spreaders in the first weeks of the outbreak.",

There are two sources of the discrepancy in R 0 estimation. First, in agreement with data on the incubation period distribution, we used a model with six exposed states, which substantially increases R 0 (T d ) with respect to the models with one or two exposed states. Second, we estimated T d based on the two-and three-week period exponential growth phase beginning on the day in which the number of registered cases exceeds 100. This approach, in contrast to estimation of R 0 based on individual case reports, allows to implicitly take into account super-spreading events that substantially shorten T d . Spatial heterogeneity of the epidemic spread observed in many European countries, including Italy, Spain, and Germany, can be associated with larger or smaller super-spreading events that initiated outbreaks is particular regions of these countries.",

As of April 25, 2020, these countries managed to terminate the exponential growth phase by means of country-wide quarantine. Current COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports (Google, 2020) show about 80% reduction of mobility in retail and recreation, transit stations, and workplaces in these countries. Together with increased social distancing, this reduction possibly lowered the infection rate \u03b2 at least fivefold; additionally, massive testing reduced the infectious period, 1/\u03b3. Consequently, we expect that the reproduction number R = \u03b2/\u03b3 was reduced more than fivefold, which brought it to the values somewhat smaller than 1. This suggests that R 0 in these countries could have been larger than 5.",

In model variants with shorter incubation period, we assume that it is Erlangdistributed with the shape parameter 6 and the scale parameter equal 0.88, giving 1/\u03c3 = 5.28, following exactly the estimates made by Lauer et al. (2020) . In model variants with longer incubation period, we replaced the \u0393 distribution of Backer et al. (2020) , having the shape parameter 6.1 and the scale parameter 1.06, resulting in 1/\u03c3 = 6.47, with the Erlang distribution with the shape parameter 6 and the scale parameter 1.078, having nearly identical shape and the same 1/\u03c3 of 6.47.",
