MHV-JHM is a highly neurovirulent strain that causes severe acute encephalitis and chronic demyelination, but not hepatitis. MHV-A59 strain is dualtropic, causing mild to moderate hepatitis, as well as acute meningoencephalitis and chronic demyelination in C57BL/6 mice. Using a combination of targeted RNA recombination to precisely manipulate the coronavirus genome, and in vivo approaches (the mouse model), we have previously reported that the coronavirus spike protein is a major determinant of pathogenesis. 1, 2 Interestingly, we have also found that expression of the hepatotropic A59 spike glycoprotein within the background of the neurotropic JHM strain does not reproduce the A59 hepatotropic phenotype. 3 Thus, our studies demonstrated that genes other than the spike play a role in coronavirus tropism and virulence. These results prompted us to further investigate which genes may account for the lack of hepatotropism of the JHM strain. We have started to assess the role of the JHM replicase gene in pathogenesis.",

Using targeted RNA recombination, we have generated chimeric recombinant A59 viruses that express the replicase gene of the non-hepatotropic JHM strain (repJHM-RA59) ( Figure  1 ). We have generated 2 independent chimeric repJHM-RA59 viruses, together with recombinant RA59 and RJHM wild-type viruses. Independent recombinants from each genotype exhibited the same phenotypes in vitro as well as in vivo. The data shown here represent results obtained from one recombinant virus per construct (RA59, RJHM and repJHM-RA59). It is well-known that A59 and JHM viruses exhibit very different replication kinetics in vitro. MHV-A59 replicates to a higher titer, whereas JHM replicates with slower kinetics and to a lower final titer, and displays higher levels of fusion and cytotoxicity. 10 We have previously reported that RA59 and RJHM recombinant viruses generated by targeted RNA recombination mimic both in vitro as well as in vivo phenotypes of wild type A59 and JHM viruses. 3 Here, we found that recombinant A59 viruses expressing the replicase gene of JHM, exhibit the same replication kinetics pattern as RA59, whereas RJHM replicates with slower kinetics and to a lower final titer than RA59 and repJHM-RA59 (Figure 2 ). This suggests that, at least in the cells tested, structural genes rather than the replicase have a major role in JHM replication kinetics.",

Although our study did not address the question of whether virulence factors are encoded by the replicase gene of JHM virus, it demonstrates that chimeric A59 virus expressing the replicase gene of JHM is as virulent as A59 wild-type in mice, and that the virulence is mostly determined by the 3' end of the viral genome, suggesting that structural genes have a major role in the highly neurovirulent JHM phenotype.",
