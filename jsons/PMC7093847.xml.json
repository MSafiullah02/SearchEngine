Group 2 subjects were in good health shown by medical history and physical examination. Volunteers were excluded from group 2 if they had received immunosuppressive medications within 168 days, blood products within 120 days, or immunoglobulins within 60 days; were immunosuppressed; had a febrile or respiratory illness within 15 days before enrollment; or had a clinically significant medical condition. All patients gave written informed consent. Eligibility was confirmed by a study physician.

The mean symptoms and signs scores at the acute illness visits were significantly greater than at the follow-up illness visits in both groups 1 and 2 for both virus- and nonvirus-associated illnesses. The mean symptoms and signs score and the mean visual analogue scale of overall illness severity were significantly higher at the follow-up illness visit for group 1 than group 2 (Table 3\n). Mean symptoms and signs scores at the acute illness visit for group 2 female patients were higher than for male patients, but statistical significance was achieved only in the case of mean scores for all illnesses (Table 3). The duration of illness is not available because this was not an outcome measure. Especially in the group 1 patients, underlying respiratory symptoms at baseline changed during acute illness but did not resolve, so that end of acute illness was difficult to pinpoint. The symptom scores suggest that illnesses in group 1 patients as a group had not returned to baseline at the convalescent 3- to 4-week follow-up illness visit.",

A weakness is that it was a single-center study in 1 geographic region. Coronaviruses and enteroviruses/rhinoviruses contributed to morbidity in both subject groups and illnesses qualifying for clinical assessment. Patients were assessed for all 4 commonly circulating coronaviruses rather than for 1 or 2, as has been the more typical report in the literature. They are alphacoronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and betacoronaviruses lineage A (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1). The related Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus are betacoronaviruses, but of the lineages B and C, respectively.

In both age groups, coronaviruses accounted for approximately 20% of illnesses and 44% to 48% of illnesses with which a virus was associated. Because coronavirus infections were the focus of this study, we were more likely to identify coronavirus-associated illnesses due to serologic diagnosis of coronavirus infection in addition to the multiplex RT-PCR assay that detected fewer infections. Enteroviruses/rhinoviruses were as likely to be identified as coronaviruses, using only RT-PCR the results of which clinically could be available sooner than acute and convalescent serology results. Viral co-infections occurred as in other reports.28, 33 The overall incidence of coronavirus-associated illnesses (considering all 4 strains in our study) was higher than that reported previously when testing for 2 strains (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43).30, 33 HCoV-OC43 was most frequent, and seroconversion to more than 1 coronavirus strain occurred in one third of illnesses, perhaps due to antigen cross-reactivity. The sensitivity of the multiplex may be less than real-time polymerase chain reaction and can be affected by viral load in the specimen and the virus strain.34, 35 The study was conducted in the years when widespread influenza epidemics were not reported, and fever, which is a hallmark of influenza, was uncommon and consistent with the lack of influenza viruses detected.",
