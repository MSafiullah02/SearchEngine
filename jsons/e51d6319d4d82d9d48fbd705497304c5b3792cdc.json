Since the discovery of human norovirus in 1972, the lack of a cell culture system has hindered biological research and antiviral studies for many years. Recent breakthroughs in culturing human norovirus have been encouraging, however, further development and optimization of these novel methodologies are required to facilitate more robust replication levels, that will enable reliable serological and replication studies, as well as advances in antiviral development. In the last few years, considerable progress has been made toward the development of norovirus antivirals, inviting an updated review. This review focuses on potential therapeutics that have been reported since 2010, which were examined across at least two model systems used for studying human norovirus or its enzymes. In addition, we have placed emphasis on antiviral compounds with a defined chemical structure. We include a comprehensive outline of directacting antivirals and offer a discussion of host-modulating compounds, a rapidly expanding and promising area of antiviral research. although the same high prevalence of this strain was not reflected in other parts of the world, with lower levels detected in Australasia, Europe, and North America compared to the Asian outbreaks during that same period. [31] [32] [33] The human norovirus positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome is 7.5 to 7.7 kb ( Figure 1 Karst et al 36 ) . ORF2 and ORF3 encode the proteins VP1 and VP2, respectively; VP1 is the major capsid protein and VP2 is the minor capsid protein, likely involved in capsid assembly and genome encapsidation. 37 The VP1 protein structure comprises the shell (S) and protruding (P) domains; the S domain encloses the viral RNA, while the antigenically variable P domain forms the outer surface of VP1, and is also involved in cell attachment. 38, 39 The VP1 protein can be expressed in baculovirus which then self-assembles into virus-like particles (VLPs). These VLPs are antigenically and structurally indistinguishable to virions produced by the complete virus. 40 ",

The Norwalk replicon consists of an intact ORF1, ORF3, and genomic 3\u2032 end, however, ORF2 is disrupted by a neomycin gene, engineered into the VP1-encoding region. As such, while the subgenomic promoter is preserved, the expression of an intact VP1 is disrupted. Self-replicating and stably expressed in Huh-7 cells or BHK-21 cell lines, 44 the Norwalk replicon has proven itself as a useful tool to screen potential antiviral compounds (Table 1) . However, replication levels of the Norwalk replicon are relatively low (approximately 1 \u00d7 10 3 Norwalk RNA copies per cell 44 ) , when compared to other replicon systems such as those for hepatitis C virus (HCV). The HCV replicons typically yield more than 1 \u00d7 10 4 copies per cell (AA Eltahla, 2018 personal communication), and have been used to identify many successful antiviral candidates. Moreover, they are amenable to high-throughput antiviral screening (reviewed in Horscroft et al 45 ) , which has directly led to many of the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) used to treat HCV infections today (reviewed in Asselah et al 46 ) .",

[54] [55] [56] Additional features that make MNV desirable for antiviral screening include its ability to be manipulated through reverse genetics, whilst in vivo studies in mice of many genetic backgrounds are straightforward. 57, 58 Various animal models have also been used for human norovirus challenge studies and include: nonhuman primates such as chimpanzees, macaques, marmosets, and tamarins. [59] [60] [61] Additionally, gnotobiotic or miniature pigs and gnotobiotic calves [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] have also been used, as well as knockout and humanized mice for norovirus infection studies. [67] [68] [69] However, no animal model has been deemed entirely suitable, due to obvious differences in clinical disease, gut physiology, microbiomes, naivety to norovirus infection compared to human populations, and the low genetic diversity of laboratory test animals. 36 ",

It should be noted that plant or food extracts that have antinorovirus effects have been omitted from this study when the active antiviral compound is unknown, with this review focusing on compounds that have a defined structure (as outlined in Table   1 ). We include studies using the recently developed human norovirus cell culture system in B cells. 41 We also discuss recently identified broad-spectrum antivirals with antinorovirus activity and provide a more comprehensive overview of host-modulating compounds, which is a recent, novel and exciting area within norovirus antiviral research.

Vitamin A-induced changes in the microflora are thought to be the mechanism responsible for these antiviral effects. 188 Lastly, nitazoxanide (NTZ) [2.5.4 ] (covered in section 3) has shown promise as an antiviral therapy, but the defined mechanism of activity against norovirus has yet to be determined. Most recently NTZ was shown to potently inhibit FCV replication in cell culture with an EC 50 of 0.6 \u00b5M, 189 and the GI norovirus replicon at a clinically relevant concentration (5 \u03bcg/mL), 190 which was later shown to result in a broad antiviral response. 191 Despite these observations, the latter study also showed that NTZ was ineffective against MNV suggesting that further antiviral investigations are warranted. 189 ",

Taken together, the antiviral activity displayed by IFN-\u03bb in these studies reveal that it has potential as a therapeutic to not only cure infections but also prevent norovirus spread if given prophylactically.More recently the group of immunomodulators known as Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists have been explored as norovirus antivirals. These compounds have been used for many years as vaccine adjuvants, but have also been shown to inhibit the replication of RNA viruses HIV and HBV.177,178 TLR agonists induce the innate immune response and stimulate IFN production, which is known to have antiviral activities against MNV and human norovirus in vitro.44,52,53,163-168 Several TLR7 agonists were shown to display potent inhibition of MNV infection, including R-848 [2.4.5] (23.5 nM), GS-9620 (0.59 \u03bcM), Gardiquimod (0.13 \u03bcM) and R-837 (1.5 \u03bcM), with therapeutic indices more than 30 for each compound.179 Furthermore, conditioned media generated by stimulation of THP-1 cells with 10 \u00b5M of R-848 reduced replication of the Norwalk replicon by 50%.179 More recently the TLR4 agonist, poly-\u03b3-glutamic acid (\u03b3-PGA)[2.4.6]  was explored as an antiviral and when tested against MNV in vitro displayed an EC 90 value < 100 nM.180 In addition, a 50 mg/kg dosage of \u03b3-PGA to mice before and following MNV infection resulted in \u226547% reduction in viral genomes.180 Given that the TLR4 agonist monophospholipid A is approved for use as an adjuvant for HPV and HBV vaccines (reviewed in Dowling and Mansell 181 ) and the TLR7 agonist R-837 is already approved for the treatment of HPV-associated genital warts,182 repurposing TLR4 and TLR7 agonists could hugely expedite their use for norovirus clinical treatment.2.5 | Compounds with unknown targetsSeveral compounds have demonstrated antiviral activity where the mechanism of inhibition is unknown. These include flavonoid-type molecules, such as theaflavin digallate [2.5.1], myricetin and epigallocatechin-3-gallate, among many others that display broad-spectrum medicinal properties, although they display limited inhibition of norovirus infection in vitro.[183][184][185][186] The mechanism of action of flavonoids against norovirus is thought to be a result of anti-inflammatory pathway activation. Similarly, phytochemicals such as curcumin[2.5.2]  are a class of compounds that display inhibition of norovirus in vitro,187 however, the mechanism of inhibition is poorly understood. Vitamin A [2.5.3] has been shown to inhibit MNV in vitro, albeit poorly with less than 50%",
