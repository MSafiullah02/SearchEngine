            "text": "\n1.\nWhat differentiates vomiting from regurgitation?\n\nVomiting is the forceful ejection of stomach and proximal duodenal contents through the mouth. Vestibular, vagal, chemoreceptor trigger zone, or direct input to the emetic center can induce vomiting. Regurgitation is the passive expulsion of food or fluid from the oral cavity, pharyngeal cavity, or esophagus (see Chapter 26). Esophageal diseases are rare in cats compared with dogs.2.\nHow is diarrhea characterized?\nDiarrhea is characterized by increased frequency of defecation, increased fluid content of the stool, or increased volume of stool. Markedly increased frequency of defecation, small-volume stools, tenesmus, urgency, hematochezia, and mucus are consistent with large bowel diarrhea. Slight increase in frequency of defecation, large volume, melena, steatorrhea, and polysystemic clinical signs are more consistent with small bowel diarrhea. Mixed bowel diarrhea is a combination of characteristics or clinical signs. The clinical differential diagnoses for vomiting and small bowel diarrheas are similar.3.\nWhat are the major differential diagnoses for vomiting and small bowel diarrhea?\nCauses can be grouped as either primary or secondary gastrointestinal (GI) tract diseases:\n\n4.\nWhat are the major differential diagnoses for large bowel diarrhea?\nMost causes of large bowel diarrhea involve the GI tract primarily and include inflammatory disease, neoplasia, obstruction (ileocecocolic valve), spastic disorder (idiopathic), dietary intolerance, infection, and parasitism. Secondary GI diseases usually are not associated with large bowel or mixed bowel diarrhea. Inflammation of the cecum, large intestine, and rectum can result in vomiting; the mechanism is vagal afferent nerve transmission to the emetic center.\n\n5.\nIs a diagnostic work-up always indicated for cats with vomiting or diarrhea?\nVomiting or diarrhea due to drugs, toxins, and dietary intolerance can be excluded by history and diet change. Otherwise healthy cats with acute vomiting and normal physical examination findings often can be managed conservatively by withholding food for 24 hours, followed by introduction of bland food for several days.6.\nWhat is the minimal diagnostic plan for cats with vomiting or diarrhea?\nFecal flotation and complete blood cell count (CBC) are indicated for most cats with vomiting. Although the CBC generally does not lead to a specific diagnosis, the presence of eosinophilia makes inflammatory bowel diseases and parasitism more likely. If diarrhea is present, wet mount examination for trophozoites, rectal cytology, and Cryptosporidium screen (fecal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] or acid-fast stain of a thin fecal smear) also are indicated. Fecal fat assessment with Sudan IV stain with and without acetic acid helps to confirm malabsorption/maldigestion but is not specific for a single disease.7.\nHow do you screen for secondary GI tract diseases associated with vomiting and diarrhea?\nA serum biochemical profile, urinalysis, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen assay, and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibody assay generally are performed in cats with chronic vomiting and diarrhea (see Chapter 25). The author generally assesses serum total T4 concentration in all cats with vomiting or small bowel diarrhea that are older than 5 years. Although amylase and lipase are poor predictors of pancreatitis in cats, a trypsin-like immunoreactivity assay has now been validated (Texas A & M University, College Station, TX). It can be used to support the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (increased) or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (decreased) in cats (see Chapter 36). If a cat with suspected pancreatitis has abdominal effusion, measure lipase concentrations in the serum and effusion; if pancreatitis is present, effusion lipase is usually greater than serum lipase.8.\nWhat are the indications for direct smears? What techniques are used?\nLiquid feces or feces that contain large quantities of mucus should be microscopically examined immediately for the presence of protozoal trophozoites, including Giardia spp. (flagellate) and Pentatrichomonas hominis (flagellate). A direct saline smear can be made to facilitate observation of these motile organisms. The amount of feces required to cover the head of a match is mixed thoroughly with one drop of 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl). After application of a coverslip, the smear is evaluated for motile organisms by examining it under 100 \u00d7 magnification.9.\nHow does rectal cytology aid in the diagnostic evaluation of cats with diarrhea?\nA thin smear of feces should be made from all cats with diarrhea. Material should be collected by rectal swab, if possible, to increase chances of finding white blood cells. A cotton swab is gently introduced 3\u20134 cm through the anus into the terminal rectum, directed to the wall of the rectum, and gently rotated several times. Placing a drop of 0.9% NaCl on the cotton swab facilitates passage through the anus but does not adversely affect cell morphology. The cotton swab is rolled on a microscope slide gently multiple times to give areas with varying thickness; three slides are usually made. After air drying, one of the slides can be stained with Diff-Quick or Wright's-Giemsa stains. The slide should be examined for white blood cells and bacteria morphologically consistent with Campylobacter jejuni or Clostridium perfringens. Histoplasma capsulatum or Prototheca spp. may be observed in the cytoplasm of mononuclear cells. Methylene blue in acetate buffer (pH = 3.6) stains trophozoites of the enteric protozoans. Iodine stains and acid methyl green also are used for the demonstration of protozoans. Acid-fast or monoclonal antibody staining (Meridian Diagnostics, Cincinnati, OH) of a fecal smear should be performed in cats with diarrhea to aid in the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidium parvum is the only enteric pathogen of approximately 4\u20136 \u03bcm in diameter that stains pink to red with acid-fast stain. Presence of neutrophils on rectal cytology may suggest inflammation induced by Salmonella spp., C. jejuni, or C. perfringens; fecal culture is indicated in such cases.10.\nWhat fecal flotation solutions should be used for cats?\nAbility to float parasite ova, oocysts, or cysts is based on the specific gravity of the solution; most ova, oocysts, and cysts are easily identified after zinc sulfate centrifugal flotation (see Chapter 19). This procedure is considered by many to be optimal for the demonstration of protozoan cysts, in particular Giardia spp.; it is a good choice for a routine flotation technique. Sugar centrifugation can be used for routine parasite evaluation and may be superior to many techniques for the demonstration of oocysts of Toxoplasma gondii and C. parvum. Giardial cysts are distorted by sugar centrifugation but can still be easily identified. Fecal sedimentation recovers most cysts and ova but also contains debris. This technique is superior to flotation procedures for the documentation of fluke eggs.\nZinc Sulfate Centrifugation Procedure\n1.Place 1 gm of fecal material in a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube.2.Add 8 drops of Lugol iodine, and mix well.3.Add 7\u20138 ml of zinc sulfate (1.18 specific gravity),*\nand mix well.4.Add zinc sulfate until there is a slight positive meniscus.5.Cover the top of the tube with a coverslip.6.Centrifuge at 1500\u20132000 rpm for 5 minutes.7.Remove the coverslip, and place on a clean microscope slide for microscopic examination.8.Examine the entire area under the coverslip for the presence of ova, oocysts, or larvae at 100 \u00d7 magnification.\n\n11.\nIf a delay is expected before feces are evaluated, should a preservative be used?\nFeces should be refrigerated, not frozen, until assayed. If a fecal sample is to be sent to a diagnostic laboratory for further analysis and will not be evaluated within 48 hours, it should be preserved. Polyvinyl alcohol, merthiolate-iodine-formalin, and 10% formalin can be used; 10% formalin is commonly used because of its routine availability. Add 1 part feces to 9 parts formalin, and mix well.12.\nHow can I increase the likelihood of diagnosing Salmonella or Campylobacter spp. infections?\nApproximately 2\u20133 gm of fresh feces should be submitted to the laboratory immediately for optimal results; however, Salmonella and Campylobacter spp. are usually viable in refrigerated fecal specimens for 3\u20137 days. The laboratory should be notified of the suspected pathogen so appropriate culture media are used. Cary-Blair medium (Bectin-Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Sparkes, MD) is appropriate for transport.13.\nAre any of the fecal antigen techniques beneficial in the evaluation of cats with gastrointestinal disease?\nParvovirus, C. parvum, and Giardia spp. antigen detection procedures are available for feces. In a limited number of feline samples assessed at Colorado State University, canine parvovirus assays detected feline parvovirus antigen and correlated well with results from electron microscopy. Sensitivity and specificity of C. parvum and Giardia antigen assays have not been determined when used with feces from cats. They should be interpreted in conjunction with results of fecal examination techniques.14.\nHow can viruses other than parvovirus be detected in feces?\nElectron microscopy can be used to detect viral particles in feces of cats with GI signs of diseases. Approximately 1\u20133 gm of feces without fixative should be transported to the laboratory (Diagnostic Laboratory, Colorado State University, College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, Fort Collins, CO) by overnight mail on cold packs. In some research laboratories, virus isolation can be performed. In addition, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be used to detect coronavirus particles in stool (see Chapter 21).15.\nHow can I assess cats for helicobacteriosis?\nGastric biopsies should be placed on urea slants to assess for urease, which is found in the cell wall of Helicobacter spp. but not in nonpathogenic spirochetes. A presumptive diagnosis of helicobacteriosis can be based on the identification of inflammatory cells and spirochetes in the gastric biopsies plus a positive urease test and exclusion of other causes of GI disease (see Chapter 20).16.\nWhat imaging techniques are beneficial in evaluating primary GI tract diseases?\nImaging techniques such as radiographs, contrast radiographs, and ultrasound can aid in the diagnosis of diseases resulting in obstruction. Abdominal radiographs should be used to support palpation findings, particularly to help prove or deny obstructive disease. Contrast radiographs are beneficial to document obstructive disease and localize lesions. Ultrasound of the GI tract can be difficult to interpret; its value depends on the skill of the operator. However, ultrasound is quite valuable in the diagnosis of secondary GI tract diseases such as pancreatitis, renal diseases, and hepatic diseases.17.\nWhen should endoscopy be considered in the work-up of a GI case?\nThe esophagus, stomach, proximal duodenum, rectum, colon, and distal ileum can be assessed endoscopically. The technique is most valuable to diagnose and retrieve foreign bodies and to obtain biopsies for evaluation of inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. Because endoscopic biopsies are small and lesions may be focal, at least 8\u201310 biopsies should be made from the stomach, duodenum, colon, and ileum, if possible. Full-thickness biopsies may be required to make a definitive diagnosis in some cats. There is no benefit to performing duodenal aspirates for quantitative bacterial cultures or giardial trophozoite evaluations in cats. The normal bacterial count range is broad in cats, and Giardia spp. are found in the distal small intestine.\n",
