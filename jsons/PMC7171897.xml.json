The book that was edited by Fathelrahman, Mohamed Ibrahim, and Wertheimer (2016), explored the pharmacy practice in 19 developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America and provided an excellent overview of pharmacy practice. The book also provides us with gaps, challenges and possible solutions for various pharmacy stakeholders in the developing countries. There is a great deal of work that needs to be done by the pharmacy stakeholders in order to improve the pharmaceutical health services for fulfilling the needs of the society. It is understood that under the sustainable development goals (SDGs), every country is in need for development (United Nations, 2017). Yet unfortunately, the weak global economy has hindered progress toward the SDGs, especially for countries with lower economic level. Development is everyone\u2019s problem and everyone\u2019s dream.\n",

This index is a comparative measure of poverty, literacy, education, life expectancy, and other factors for countries worldwide. For the sake of the discussion, the book will consider the classification of countries based on per capita gross national income (i.e., low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)).",

Around 50% of the world\u2019s population are residing in LMICs and they are still living in poverty with poor health status and inadequate healthcare. In any healthcare system, pharmacy system is one of the core components and pharmacists play a very important role. With the dynamic changes happening in healthcare, disease, information communication technology and regulations, and the roles and responsibilities of pharmacists are becoming more important than before. The expectations on the pharmacists are changing; the societal needs and demands are much greater compared with several decades ago. On the other hand, there are growing problems with medicines, the health system, and human resources, especially in the LMICs. There are countries with high prices of medicines, a wide prevalence of nonquality medicines (i.e., substandard and counterfeit), lack of access to medicines, and absence of a national medicines policy (NMP) even with strong encouragement from World Health Organization (WHO). Poor health and pharmaceutical sectors in a country will increase the vulnerability of the country toward several critical problems at micro- and macrolevels and leaves the society at risk. In the medicines supply system, to ensure access to medicines, the following aspects are critical:\u2022reliable health and supply systems;\u2022sustainable financing;\u2022rational selection; and\u2022affordable prices of medicines.\n",

Health literacy is fundamental to the effectiveness of health programs and improvement to the quality of life. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Institute for Statistics found that around 7% of countries (13/180) indicate an adult literacy rate below 50%. All these countries are from sub-Saharan Africa, and the lowest adult literacy rate is in Mali with a 26.2% (United Nations, 2009). Another issue is corruption. Corruption (e.g., misinformation, bribery, theft, and bureaucratic corruption) is a global problem and negatively affects the medicines supply chain and the overall healthcare system. The backbone of the health system is formed by well-functioning supply chains that deliver various pharmaceutical products (Yadav, 2015). The Corruption Perception Index 2016 illustrated that none of the LMICs listed top 10 of the transparent (i.e., clean) ranking. On the scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), over two-thirds of the 176 countries and territories in this index fall below the midpoint (Transparency International, 2016). People also faced with issues related to substandard medicines, counterfeit drugs, nutrition, tobacco consumption, maternal and child health, and environmental hazards (WHO, 2017). WHO (2014) reported that the environmental hazards such air pollution caused around 7 million premature deaths a year. Most areas affected were densely populated LMICs. The conditions in the developing countries become worse when people suffer from various turmoil conditions such as war, humanitarian conflict, and public health crisis, which further collapse completely the healthcare system. These aspects make working in the healthcare system and the practice of pharmacists more challenging.",

The lack of adequate, resilient public health surveillance systems, infrastructure to effectively deploy resources, and a health workforce to provide accessible, quality care where needed leaves us vulnerable to regional and global spread. Despite the progress that has been made in the last two decades, more needs to be done to create enabling regulatory environments. Understanding the social and cultural contexts that may contribute to these problems, plus effective solutions, is also crucial. Health communication often receives less attention and fewer resources than medical, scientific, or policy areas. There is an urgent need for society to value and invest more in evidence-informed public health strategies. The multifactorial nature of broader global health issues poses an enormous challenge to all stakeholders (WHO, 2016b). Effective public health action depends on understanding the scale and nature of threats to health (WHO, 1986). According to the Ottawa patient charter, the public health community has a duty to make the invisible visible. They must measure and assess the burden of diseases, health status, and risk factors including the protection factors. The public health community must make the best use of data to promote health. Public health interventions should be evaluated, using rigorous research methods, and the results disseminated. The public health community must ensure that evidence is used to give voice to those who would otherwise be unheard. Research findings must be disseminated effectively to the different stakeholders in the health sectors, including public, policy makers, practitioners, and (social) media. Findings at times are complex and this information should be delivered in ways that are comprehensible and in a timely manner (Lomazzi, 2016).",

Most change is due to money. For instance, robotics, automation, and technicians are widely used to save money. In the hospital setting, unit dose, unit-of-use, etc. are done to save cost.

Their efforts enhance the quality of individual\u2019s lives by helping people to live as free as possible from disease, pain, and suffering (Jandovitz & Brygider, 2005). With respect to their relationship with the public, pharmacists are often portrayed as an underused resource for health- and medicines-related advice and information. Furthermore, the practice of pharmacy involves both pharmacist and public and can be conceptualized as a social process (Harding & Taylor, 2009, p. 395). Don\u2019t we need something about the efforts to locate new pharmacy roles, e.g., in relation to immunizations, patient advisor, educator and advocator for wellness, screening and prevention activities, birth control promotions, and other population health initiatives? Pharmacists have an obligation to educate the public in LMICs, for example, teaching poor rural women about birth control and safe sex especially if their partner has HIV, etc. The other one is to encourage immunizations. In certain places, some cult leader and religious groups discourage their followers not to be immunized and then we end up with local epidemics of preventable conditions such as polio. Hence, understanding the concepts and principles behind social pharmacy disciplines is important and useful. There is a need to apply a socioecological model to public health issues that are impacting the health of the population.",

The social sciences component includes demography, anthropology, psychology, social psychology, sociology, political sciences, and geography (Mount, 1989), while the administrative sciences component includes areas such as management, marketing, finance, economics, organizational behavior, law, policy, ethics, information technology, and statistics. Social and administrative pharmacy is the integration and application of the social and administrative sciences disciplines in pharmacy, i.e., education and practice. Social pharmacy scientists utilize both sciences to improve clinical practice, enhance the effectiveness of pharmaceutical regulations and policy, advocate political awareness, and promote improvements in pharmaceutical health services and healthcare delivery. Social pharmacy applied a biopsychosocial or socioenvironmental method to understand health and illness conditions (Claire, 2008). Many types of research use either the quantitative or qualitative or a mixed method approach, from simple to complex statistical methods and modeling in pharmacy practice to make changes and improvement in the healthcare system, quality of care, and patient\u2019s quality of life. In addition, there are many useful tools from the social and behavioral sciences literature that researchers could use, for example, in helping with patient\u2013pharmacist communication and compliance enhancement efforts.",

For example, pharmacy colleges in a country might be reluctant to accept improvement in the curriculum. The pharmacy educators think that they are superior, and the curriculum developed and used, for example, in the last decades was excellent. In some cases, there is an imbalance of focus between the pharmaceutical sciences courses and the pharmacy practice and administration courses. They consider teaching more of the basic pharmaceutical sciences subjects to the undergraduate students or just offering pharmaceutical sciences-related research (i.e., lab-based research) at the MSc and PhD level is adequate to provide the pharmacy graduates knowledge and skill to practice. The regiocentric or geocentric phenomenon in pharmacy practice is quite common and could be observed in the middle east region, for example. Further, political struggle and lack of leadership could hurt the dynamic and mission of the pharmacy profession. According to Morgall and Almarsd\u00f3ttir (1999), the pharmacy profession could lose its monopoly and become weak due to the internal conflicts.

Most of the times, the internal politics and a lack of understanding limit or even counteract the collaboration of clinical and social pharmacy, thus weakening both fields (Almarsdottir & Granas, 2016). However, there are cases, to name a few, which had reported positive experience such as in Malaysia. School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia that was established in 1972, first introduced a course \u201cDrugs in Developing Countries\u201d (Mohamed Izham, Awang, & Abdul Razak, 1998) in the early 1990s. After a long struggle, the discipline was established in 2002 (School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, n.d.). Several important courses (e.g., drug and society, social and public health pharmacy, pharmaceutical management and marketing, and pharmacoeconomics) managed to be included in the pharmacy curriculum. These additions offer a perspective on the pharmacy that balances and complements the behavioral and natural/physical sciences component of the pharmacy curriculum (Hassali et al., 2011) to produce well-rounded graduates. In addition, the department has also produced hundreds pieces of social and administrative pharmacy-related research generated from more than 150 MSc and PhD students from around 15 LMICs. Kostriba, Alwarafi, and Vlcek (2014) identified large differences in approach and scope of teaching social pharmacy courses as a field of study in the undergraduate pharmacy education worldwide. They also identified regional trends connected with the political, economic, and social aspects of particular regions. Basak (2012) expressed concern with the recent changes in the Indian pharmacy education. According to the author, in the introduction of the PharmD program (Pharmacy Council of India, n.d.), social pharmacy is the least developed discipline in the curriculum. It called for cooperation in an attempt to develop social pharmacy components in teaching and research in India. There is a drive to incorporate the social pharmacy topics in the Yemeni pharmacy education even with all the challenges and limitations that the country is experiencing nowadays (Alshakka, Aldubhani, Basaleem, Hassali, & Mohamed Ibrahim, 2015). In Libya, according to Abrika, Hassali, and Abduelkarem (2012), the pharmacy practitioners were supportive with the ideas of inclusion of social pharmacy subjects in the curriculum because it will enhance the pharmacists\u2019 professional roles.",

According to the authors, pharmacy education and practice must require greater mastery of social and behavioral science. In the United Kingdom, the incorporation of social and behavioral sciences into the curricula of all schools of pharmacy, reflecting a broad recognition that pharmacy practice does not simply involve supplying medicines and advice to a passive public who take their medicines and follow expert advice without question (Harding & Taylor, 2009, p. 395).",

Very little has been published in the main stream, international literature about the status of pharmacy in the lesser developed countries. It is possible that some more is published in local journals in local languages that may be of limited help to others outside of that country. There are other problems as well. One is that accurate and timely vital health statistics may not be available for any of many possible reasons, such as budget restrictions, and shame in reporting accurate and precise reports that are not flattering to that country\u2019s leaders in the healthcare area.",
