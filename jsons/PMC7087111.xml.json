The sampling of bats was approved by the Administrative Committee on Animal Welfare of the Military Veterinary Institute, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, China (Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee Authorization, permit number JSY-DW-2010-02). All organs were pooled and subjected to viral metagenomic analysis as per our published method [4]. Results revealed 1,436 reads relating to orthohepadnaviruses, with an average length of 147 nucleotides (nt) and showing 68-74 % nt sequence identity to a Hipposideros BtHV from Gabon in its partial S and C genes. All liver samples were screened by PCR for orthohepadnavirus as described previously [3]. The results showed that 20 % (4/20) of pomona roundleaf bats (Hipposideros pomona) were positive, with all amplicons sharing >99 % nt sequence identity. All remaining bats were negative.",

The genomic organizations were identical to those of other orthohepadnaviruses, containing four open reading frames (ORFs) encoding Pol, preS1/preS2/S, preC/C and X proteins in a circular and compact configuration. Orthohepadnaviral genomic characteristics, such as a highly conserved YMDD motif [6] and encapsidation signal \u03b5 [5], were also found in the PEPR genomes and were essentially identical to those of other orthohepadnaviruses. Predicted genomic structures and sequence comparisons are summarized in Table 1. The results showed that PEPR shared the highest nt and amino acid (aa) sequence identities in the Pol-, preS1/preS2/S-, and X genes with strain HBHBV identified in Hipposideros spp. from Gabon [2], while the preC/C gene of PEPR alone showed highest nt and aa sequence identity with isolate 776, a representative of Miniopterus BtHV in Myanmar [3].\n",

The phylogenetic tree showed that all sequences clustered into seven distinct groups sharing <74 % nt identity. Three consisted of avian, primate, and rodent hepatitis viruses and corresponded to the approved species listed in the Ninth Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) from 2011 [8] (Fig. 1). The bat-associated orthohepadnaviruses identified in Myanmar, Panama, and Gabon [2, 3] and in this study were genetically diverse and classified into four distinct groups (Fig. 1). Comparisons of the full genome sequence of PEPR with those of BtHVs showed that sequence identity ranged from 60 % (with TBHBV) to 73 % (with HBHBV), and around 63 % with primate and rodent hepatitis viruses. Notably, PEPR was only 70 % identical to BtHVs in Myanmar, showing wide genetic heterogeneity. Although PEPR in Yunnan and HBHBV from Gabon both originated from Hipposideros spp., they shared only 73 % nt sequence identity; i.e., less than within both the primate hepatitis virus group (e.g., HBV and WMHBV; ~80 %) and the rodent hepatitis virus group (e.g., WHV and GSHV; ~85 %) [8]. These results show that BtHVs of wide genetic diversity exist within the genus Orthohepadnavirus, differing according to the bat genus or species and therefore requiring classification into different species.\n",

The phylogenetic tree was constructed by the maximum-likelihood method using MEGA 5.1. Viruses identified in this study are indicted by filled triangles; previous BtHVs, with open triangles. The hosts of RBHBV and HBHBV in Gabon, TBHBV in Panama, BtHV in Myanmar and BtHV in China are Rhinolophus alcyone, Hipposideros\ncf. ruber, Uroderma\nbilobatum, Miniopterus\nfuliginosus and Hipposideros\npomona. The scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site",
