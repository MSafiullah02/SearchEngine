A huge number of cases (n = 5,722) were registered in the country, and 2,450 patients were faced with life-threatening respiratory paralysis.1 In the first four months of the epidemic, the Belgrams Hospital of Copenhagen had to treat three times as many patients with respiratory failure than it had in the previous ten years. The Danish healthcare system was overwhelmed. In the first six weeks of the epidemic, 27 of 31 patients with respiratory insufficiency died. That crisis is reminiscent of the current COVID-19 concerns in our hospitals today.",

A large number of patients admitted to these wards met the criteria of Dr. Ibsen to be treated with tracheostomies and manual ventilation by an attendant. The non-availability of enough medical staff to manually ventilate all those patients became the new challenge. Ibsen convinced the authorities to recruit all the medical students of Denmark and have them come to the rescue. These newly appointed care givers received a brief introduction in the method of manual ventilation. They then sat for six-hour shifts at the bedside of the patients to ventilate them and suction their lungs when needed. Over 250 medical students and 260 nurses were enrolled to provide this care to those patients.1 At the height of the epidemic, 75 patients were manually ventilated. The mortality from respiratory failure in polio patients was thus reduced from 90% to 15%. Dr. Ibsen referred to these healthcare workers as \u201cpiecework anesthetists\u201d.1",

It is relatively easy to learn how to manually ventilate an intubated patient. Even though the quality of their ventilation may not be perfect, it would be 100% better than no ventilation. Fortunately, it appears that the younger generation is being relatively spared from the most severe effects of COVID-19. There will soon be enough volunteers to fill two-hour shifts for ventilating patients when and/or where ventilators are not available. The risks of re-infection for those with demonstrated antibodies against COVID-19 will need to be evaluated and they will still need appropriate personal protective equipment.",
