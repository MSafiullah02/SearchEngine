Building efficient schedules is one of the best ways for the transportation industry to maximize profit. This problem has attracted much research interest in developed countries since the 1960s. Many approaches have been developed, most of which have been reported in a series of international conferences on Computer\u2010aided Public Transport Scheduling (e.g., Hickman et al., 2008).",

Much of it attempts to build a mathematical or heuristic model to tackle the bus vehicle scheduling problem on a line\u2010by\u2010line basis (Li et al., 2004, 1992, 1995, 2007, 2003, 2004b). Unfortunately, it still requires much effort to meet the practical requirements of bus operators. So far, the bus operators commonly schedule their buses and drivers manually on a line\u2010by\u2010line basis. The operation mode and scheduling methods have not significantly improved since the establishment of P. R. China in 1949; however, the number of vehicles has increased more than 1000 times since then, from fewer than 200 to about 240,000 buses. In contrast to western countries, the mode of bus operation and the scheduling methods in China are very inefficient, and are difficult to adapt to the rapid increase in vehicle numbers and the changed requirements of bus services. The backward mode of operation and the scheduling methods have caused many problems to the bus operators and the government. The major problems are summed up as follows:",

Each line has to be assigned enough buses and drivers to meet the demands of its own peak times. This will cause some buses and drivers to be left unused before and after the peak times. Hence, the utilization of these resources which are not allowed be switched between lines, is restricted.2\nThe management and operational cost is high  Each line has to set up an individual management group and its own depot in most cases. The ratio of staff to buses may reach 5 to 1 in many bus companies; the distributed depots occupy much precious land in cities.3\nSchedules are compiled manually and cannot be timely adjusted according to changes  Normally compiling a set of bus and driver schedules for a line will take about 20 person\u2010days. It is also very time\u2010consuming to adjust schedules according to changes in service demands and operating conditions; therefore, many schedulers abandon such adjustments because they can only achieve them with difficulty. Furthermore, schedules compiled manually are usually too simple to fit the real service demands and operating environment, and hence they can seldom be executed. For this reason, some bus companies do not compile schedules at all.4\nThere are no practical schedules guiding dispatchers and drivers  Each terminus has to have a dispatcher, who plays part of the roles of schedulers by deciding the departure time of each service trip according to experience. The efficiency of dispatching depends greatly on the experience, responsibility and personal authority to drivers of an individual dispatcher.5\nBus services are often in disorder\n The bus service is independent between individual lines; hence the different lines passing along the same road cannot be organized and scheduled together. It often causes disorder at bus\u2010stops as several buses arrive simultaneously. This phenomenon is quite common in many cities, and is called train\u2010like bus service.\n",

            "text": "The above\u2010mentioned problems have been exerting more and more pressure on both bus operators and the state and city governments because most of the bus companies are fully or partially owned by the state. In 2002, the Beijing Bus Group (BJBUS), the largest bus company in China, applied to the Ministry of Science and Technology to run a \u201cDemonstration Project on Unified Bus Transit Scheduling and Dispatching of Beijing Bus Group\u201d (Shen and Xia, 2004a). The application was approved and became one of the 10 large study projects on transportation supported by the state. The demonstration project of BJBUS attempts to set up a pattern of scheduling buses and drivers using computers based on a unified operation mode for the 1300 bus companies in China. It was anticipated that most of the bus operators in China would apply the advanced scheduling techniques to schedule their buses and drivers based on a unified mode of operation before the start of the 2008 Olympic Games. It was also anticipated that it would save about 5\u201310% of buses and drivers by applying the procedures obtained in the project. This would have a great significance in China, where there would be 400,000 buses and one million drivers in services in 2008. However, there were fears that the new operation mode would cause unpredictable problems during the critical year of the Olympic games. It is therefore at present only used within one sub\u2010district of the Beijing Bus Group. Wider implementation of the system will take place after 2008.",

Over 85% of bus services in the city of Beijing are provided by BJBUS, which possesses about 22,000 buses working on 776 lines, each scheduled separately, with about 97,000 drivers. Bus services in Beijing have to meet extraordinary levels of demand and traffic congestion. The nature of the scheduling problem is different from most of those described in the publications of developed countries (e.g., Hickman et al., 2008; Desaulnier, 2007; Ernst et al., 2004), but typical in China. In the most successful bus and driver scheduling systems, many of which are developed based on the operations in developed countries, buses and drivers are scheduled independently, and can switch between lines during a single work period. However, the scheduling mode and requirements of BJBUS are considerably different: buses and drivers are scheduled manually and simultaneously on a line\u2010by\u2010line basis; each line is assigned a fixed number of buses and drivers to meet the demands in its own peak times; there is a set of rules governing the legality of duty generation (a duty is the work to be performed by a driver during one day from signing on until signing off at the depot); besides the most common rules such as maximum daily driving time limits, say 8 h (listed in Smith and Wren, 1988), there are some rules stipulated according to Chinese conventions, e.g., a meal break must occur within the customary time range for lunch or dinner, say, from 11:30 to 13:00 or from 18:00 to 20:00; the scheduling strategy is to develop bus schedules with built\u2010in periods at lunch or dinner time when the buses are parked at the terminus so that meal breaks can be taken; each bus can be assigned to at most two duties; each duty is limited to work on at most two buses (a single bus is preferable).",

Each trip is a timetabled activity that starts and ends at specified times and locations. Bus scheduling involves making feasible and economical links among these activities. The feasibility of a solution depends mainly on whether there is enough time for the bus to connect between two successive trips. This problem has several variations depending on the number of depots, the number of bus types, the length of trips and some practical requirements, such as each bus must start and end its work day at the same depot.",

Later, the VAMPIRES system, developed using the traditional procedural approach, was enhanced by BOOST (Kwan and Rahin, 1999), embracing the object\u2010oriented paradigm and using a more user\u2010friendly interface. The bus scheduling algorithm belongs to the class of heuristics generally known as \u201c2\u2010opt\u201d. It first forms a crude initial schedule using a target number of buses. The target is either estimated by an automatic process or specified by the user. It is possible that some of the links in the initial schedule are time infeasible, i.e. the bus arrives later than it is due to depart. The schedule is then iteratively refined. In each iteration, selected pairs of links are broken up and re\u2010linked in the opposite way if the overall infeasibility and/or cost of the schedule are reduced. At the end, either the lowest cost feasible solution found is returned, or, if the target number of buses is too low, the critical bus trips that might be retimed to make the target number of buses feasible are indicated. VAMPIRES has been used in many hundreds of real bus scheduling problems, and has never failed to find the best known solution. BOOST, its successor, has been used in some feasibility studies involving bus companies in the United Kingdom and Brazil. Wren and Kwan (1999) report an application for one United Kingdom bus company, whose main depot in the city centre has been relocated to a new site. They satisfactorily used BOOST to re\u2010schedule their entire new operation.",

The cost of operating the actual trips in most practical situations may be regarded as constant, and therefore for the optimization process the total cost of a bus schedule can be regarded as the sum of the costs of all the individual links. This costing method is called a link\u2010based costing method, in which each link in a bus (a chain of links) has an independent cost and the sum of the individual costs constitutes the cost of the chain. A revised chain can be easily costed by re\u2010costing only the revised or newly added links involving only simple addition and subtraction. For instance, in BOOST the cost difference between a current schedule and the new schedule after a 2\u2010opt exchange between two links is just the same as the cost difference between the two pairs of links before and after the exchange.",

Therefore, when any link in a bus is changed, the validation of built\u2010in periods has to be evaluated again. In this case, it is hard to assess precisely how much a link is contributing to optimality, and hence the cost of a bus. We therefore develop a chain\u2010based costing method. It simply treats all the links in the same bus as having the same cost as the entire bus. When any link in a bus is changed, the bus is transformed, and the cost must be re\u2010calculated according to its constituent links, the consistency of bus types and the validation of built\u2010in periods.

The number of possible combinations for partitioning the bus work is usually astronomical. There is a set of restrictions on efficient provision of driver schedules. For example, the daily working time for a driver has to be limited to a certain number of hours. These restrictions are normally called labour agreement rules, which vary a great deal between different operators. The most common rules for bus drivers are listed in Smith and Wren (1988). The rules governing the legality of a driver duty affect profoundly the complexity of duty compilation. The criteria are usually that the schedule must be legal according to the rules and should have the minimum number of duties and lowest total hours of work. In China, minimizing the number of duties generally has priority over minimizing the total hours of work.",

They involve generating a set of legal potential duties from which a minimal and most efficient subset is selected. Despite advances in the ILP solvers, such as column generation techniques, some artificial restrictions must still be imposed on the duties in order to reduce the size of the set. For example, in practice, when a vehicle stops at a location, there is often a gap between the arrival time and the departure time, which is called a time window. A time window at a particular relief point constitutes a window of relief opportunities (WRO), during which drivers can be relieved. The generate\u2010and\u2010select\u2010based approach cannot handle WROs (Shen and Kwan, 2001a; Shen, 2001). The usual simplification is to consider one, sometimes two, discrete times within each WRO. Besides this simplification, filtering rules are often applied so that the set of potential duties generated would not be prohibitively large. For example, a minimum length may be imposed on a continuous spell of driving work. This parameter normally would be set to the highest value that would not prevent \u201cgood\u201d duties from being generated. However, in practice there is no such thing as \u201ctoo short a piece of work\u201d for the driver, and the combinatorial nature of the problem is such that some small pieces of work may be vital in forming an efficient schedule as a whole. The resultant model solved therefore diverts from the true real\u2010life setting and optimality is compromised. Tuning the parameterized filtering rules is also frustrating to schedulers and time\u2010consuming.",

Moreover, applying so many artificial rules will considerably compromise the optimal solution.2WROs provide BJBUS with more chances to compile a \u201cgood\u201d schedule, but cannot be practically handled by the ILP\u2010based approach.3The problems in BJBUS even with some extent of decomposition may still be too large according to the capability of the ILP solver. A series of techniques to reduce the number of variables (potential duties) and constraints (ROs) has to be operated, and hence, the optimal solution will be further compromised.4Owing to the quick development and the unstable running conditions in China, bus schedules are usually changed more frequently. As a result, driver schedules need to be recompiled accordingly, and hence, a driver scheduling approach with fast computation and ease of use is expected.

This is very important to achieve acceptance of the new scheduling and management mode by operators and schedulers, and vital for the system to reach the level of real application under a unified operation mode.4Each schedule is associated with a set of statistical data, some of which is related to the wage cost of drivers. Hence, it can be helpful to justify more equitably the work of drivers than the current method, in which much data is produced based on an average of the work of the drivers on the same bus.5Using the IBTS system, a scheduler can produce quickly the whole set of schedules within the scheduling area.
