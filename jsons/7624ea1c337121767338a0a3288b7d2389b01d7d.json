At the time of this writing, two such pathogens are active, warranting such concern: a) cases of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, caused by a coronavirus) appeared in China in November, 2002, and has spread to Western and Central Europe and North America; b) a strain of Avian Influenza Virus (N5H1), first identified in Hong Kong in 1997, reemerged in 2002 in Southeast Asia. Other avian flu strains found simultaneously in poultry in North America have underscored the concern of local and international health authorities. Both SARS and avian flu demonstrate high mortality rates, but, to date, the number of cases has been only in the hundreds. So, are these pestilences? What constitutes a pestilence? Is the term synonymous with newly emerging diseases? Two definitions of pestilence have near unanimity, but are not very specific: a) \"Any fatal epidemic disease, affecting man or beast, and destroying many victims.\" The Oxford Universal Dictionary, 3 rd edition, 1955, Oxford Press, 2515 pp. b) \"A contagious or infectious epidemic disease that is virulent and devastating.\"",

            "text": "Accordingly, a pestilence should be an infectious disease, devastating (killing) a large number of people (or animals). The truly epidemic diseases are usually of viral or bacterial origin (although we will make a case for some other types of pestilences). The classification of that may have been bubonic plague continuing until A.D. 750). The \"Black Death\" of the fourteenth century, which continued to appear in chronic pockets of Europe and the Middle and Near East for centuries thereafter, is by far the best-known plague, and the one that produced the greatest mortality and social impact on the affected populations. Consider that as a conservative estimate, 25\u221233% of the European population died, and maybe more. This death rate reduced the available work force so that, for the first time, peasants and landless people could sell their labor, which introduced freedom of movement and resulted in economic changes that eventually contributed to the decline of the feudal system. The 3 rd pandemic of plague began in the 1850s and continues to this date, although reduced in more recent years. A major characteristic of this epidemic has been the dissemination of plague from its traditional homes in Africa and Asia into areas previously plague free, especially North and South America, by the inadvertent transport of rats and their fleas by boat. The infection is now well established in Africa (gerbils); Central Asia (gerbils, ground squirrels or \"susliks,\" and marmots); Southeast Asia (various Rattus species); North America (ground squirrels and some native field mice); and South America (introduced Rattus). The last major urban outbreak was in Surat, India in 1994: More than 6,500 cases and 56 deaths were reported. However, the impact of this outbreak was also seen in the number of people who fled the plague zone, and the over two billion dollar loss that ensued.",

Many other sites of infection are known and should be monitored, as some rodent species are highly susceptible to serving as effective amplifying reservoirs, whereas others maintain low-level infections for long periods of time, allowing much time to pass between outbreaks. Environmental measures (rat-proofing, rodent and flea control, etc.,) are the first measures of control. Surveillance, prompt diagnosis, and treatment with antibiotics (e.g., streptomycin and tetracycline) are recommended.",

The disease has two cycles: a 'jungle' cycle involving various tree dwelling mosquitoes and nonhuman primates as reservoirs, and an 'urban' cycle, with A. aegypti as the vector and humans as reservoirs. The last reported major African outbreak vectored by A. aegypti occurred in Nigeria and involved some 20,000 cases and over 4,000 deaths between 1986 and 1991.",

Epidemics of YF raged throughout the Caribbean and tropical America until the end of the 1800s, when the transmission cycle was elucidated by the team led by Walter Reed, confirming the role of A. aegypti which had been proposed by, but not confirmed by, Carlos Finlay. Epidemics occurred as far north as Philadelphia in the United States and the last epidemic in North America occurred in New Orleans as late as 1905, with over 3,000 deaths. Cases (with 25-50%) mortality continue to occur sporadically in Brazil and in the foothills of several Andean countries (Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia) . Often the victims are young, indigenous males from the highlands who were temporarily working in the coca processing plants in the forests. These infected areas are only kilometers from large cities (with populations of more than 1 million people) such as Santa Cruz, Bolivia, which are accessible by public transportation and are heavily infested with A. aegypti.",

It was difficult to determine the origin of cholera and/or to distinguish it historically from other diarrhetic diseases except by the severity and rapidity of onset. Health historians such as McNeill suggest an origin on the Indian sub-continent, associated with dense populations, poor hygiene, and certain religious practices such as communal bathing; thus the term \"Asiatic cholera,\" by which the disease became known in Europe in the 1800s. The disease' s appearance in Europe and the Americas (London and New York in 1832, and again in 1854) were clearly associated with intercontinental traffic. It was during the 1854 epidemic in London that a physician, John Snow, noted the clustering of cases and deaths in people using the same water source, and proposed what turned out to be the correct action to stop the epidemic (\"Take the handle off the Broad Street pump!!\"), although he had no idea of the actual cause of the disease. However, it was such observations, along with structural, hygienic, and administrative changes in major cities, particularly in Europe and North America, that established the public health measures that we tend to take for granted in this early part of the 21 st century.",

However, in 622 A.D., Ad Ahrun, a Christian priest living in Alexandria, Egypt, described the pox lesion, and in 910 A.D. the Arab physician Al-Razi distinguished between the two diseases. Prior to widespread immunization, measles was common in childhood-more than 90% of people were infected by age 20. Although endemic in large communities, measles became epidemic every several years, with the severity of infection decreasing with the frequency of the epidemics. In his study of the history of plagues, McNeill makes mention of the importance of animal husbandry and zoonotic diseases in the area. Measles, he claims is probably related to both rinderpest (in hoofed-mammals) and canine distemper. Because dogs, sheep, and goats have been domesticated for at least 10,000 years, measles may have been among the first viral diseases to have \"jumped the species barrier.\" As we will see, most, if not all, of the new pestilences are, or may be, derived from animal wild or domesticated reservoirs. Measles was responsible for (or contributed to, along with smallpox) the decimation of the indigenous Amerindian populations, first in Central and South America at the time of the Spanish conquest (1500s), and later (1700s and 1800s), in North America. Amerindian populations lacked immunological protection from these and other imported infectious diseases. Some attribute this immunological na\u00efvet\u00e9 to the comparatively small number of domesticated animal species-dogs, ducks and turkeys, guinea pigs, and cameloids (llamas and relatives) in the Andes, and few, if any, in large number prior to the European invasion. In any case, the attack and mortality rates were staggering. By one estimate, a pre-conquest Amerindian population of perhaps thirty million by 1556 was reduced by 90%, down to only 3 million. This catastrophe occurred in less than 50 years after the Spanish entered the American mainland.",

Various medieval and Renaissance writings describe influenza-like illnesses. Robert Johnson of Philadelphia is credited with the first \"modern\" description of an influenza epidemic, which occurred in that city in 1793. His description was applied to subsequent epidemics in 1833, 1837, 1847, 1889-90, and 1918. Antigenic shifts in the structure of the influenza virus may change the virulence of the strains, increasing the likelihood of epidemics. The most severe flu epidemic ever recorded (1918) (1919) -also known as the Spanish flu (although it did not originate there)-first struck World War I troops of all combatant nations while in northern France, and it continued on to become a global pandemic.

Yet, for the more recently known Hantavirus group, or even less with the multiferous arboviruses, we do not have good data on ecological determinents, or even host-reservoir relationships.",

            "text": "At the same time, people are modifying environmental conditions rapidly and extensively, and we have little information indicating whether such changes will eliminate potential disease cycles or exacerbate them. This may be even more important for diseases like influenza. If they have obligate or opportunistic vertebrate hosts and these are coincidentily reduced in number or eliminated, what selection pressures are set in action on the virus population to select new hosts? And when it comes to modifying environments, man has no equal. Yet we know that this microbial evolution is going on at a rapid pace-just look at how fast drug-resistance develops and spreads! In reading articles and researching references for this document, I was amazed to discover again how many human illnesses have their direct animal (zoonotic) counterparts, or were vectored/hosted by arthropods, rodents, or snails, and how an avian influenza can become a mammalian influenza very quickly, and how a bat or an oppossum can do the same for the Chagas disease trypanosome. It is in this context that I feel that we know very little of the natural history or the ecological dynamics of the disease transmission cycles we teach.",

If one was to dream up a model pathogen incubator and dissemination engine, the perfect model would be a modern chicken farm of 500,000 birds, defecating as birds do, and that at a constant temperature and with residues of organic chicken feed all about. And we wonder why new diseases emerge? Any farmer worth his/her salt knows that monoculture breeds pests. This is a good place to bring up one other difficult subject-bioterrorism. It is difficult for one dedicated to public health principles to imagine why anyone would even consider using infectious diseases as a weapon, but it is being done, and we need to be able to distinguish between a natural epidemic and one orchestrated by man. Again, knowledge of the natural history of the organisms, their natural hosts and reservoirs, will help. Already the U.S.A. is stockpiling smallpox and anthrax vaccines in large quantities.",

But public health work is broader than the study and treatment of infectious diseases, and the study The Global Burden of Disease, sponsored by the WHO, World Bank, and Harvard University, based on measuring DALYS, predicts that fewer infectious disease will be as important in the future as they are at present. For example, \"The next two decades will see dramatic changes in the health needs of the world' s populations, and non-communicable diseases such as depression and heart disease . . . are replacing the traditional enemies, such as infectious diseases and malnutrition.\"",
