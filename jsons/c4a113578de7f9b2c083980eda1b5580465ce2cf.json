COVID-19 drugs targeting human proteins will potentially result in less drug resistance but could also exhibit unintended effects on other complex diseases. Here we pooled 353 candidate drug targets of COVID-19 from clinical trial registries and the literature and estimated their putative causal effects in 11 SARS-CoV-2 related tissues on 622 complex human diseases. By constructing a disease atlas of drug targets for COVID-19, we prioritise 726 target-disease associations with evidence of causality using robust Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization evidence (http://epigraphdb.org/covid-19/ctda/). Triangulating these MR findings with historic drug trial information and the druggable genome, we ranked and prioritised three genes DHODH, ITGB5 and JAK2 targeted by three marketed drugs (Leflunomide, Cilengitide and Baricitinib) which may have repurposing potential with careful risk assessment.",

After removing duplicates, 380 unique targets were selected (Supplementary Table 2 ). The genetic predictors (instruments) for the 380 target genes in 11 SARS-CoV-2 related tissues were extracted from 4 recent expression and protein quantitative trait locus (eQTL and pQTL respectively) studies (3)(10)(11) (12) . From these studies 1493 instruments for 353 drug targets were available for our proteome/transcriptome-wide association analysis (Supplementary Table  3 ), while the remaining 27 targets have no robustly associated genetic variants.",

Where data was available, we also tested the tissue-specific effects of gene expression of the same targets on the outcome phenotypes. Overall, 372,482 target-disease associations were estimated in the 11 COVID-19 relevant tissues (see the list of tissues in Methods). Overall, we observed 833 target-disease associations with robust MR evidence in the 11 tested tissues. 726 of the 833 (87.2%) associations also showed strong colocalization evidence (colocalization probability > 70%) (Supplementary Table 5 , 6, 7 and 8), making these the most reliable findings of this study. Of these, 366 associations were obtained using a single cis instrument in a Wald ratio model (16) , 327 were obtained using a single trans instrument and 33 were estimated using multiple instruments in an inverse variance weighted (IVW) model (17) . The remaining 107 (12.8%) associations had evidence from MR but did not have strong evidence of colocalization (probability<70%; Supplementary Table 9 ), emphasizing the importance of this approach to address confounding by linkage disequilibrium (LD) in phenome-wide association studies.",

Tissue-specific associations were observed between 11 to 17 of the target genes and these four diseases (Supplementary Table 10 ).

The top 5 target genes were DHODH, ITGB5, JAK2, TFRC and POR, scoring 1 in at least two categories and more than zero in at least one other category. ITGB5 is the target for Cilengitide, which was primarily developed for treating cancers such as glioblastoma. Our study prioritised this target in three categories (omics score=1, druggable score=1, trial score=0.75, infection score=0), which implies that it merits further investigation as a potential target for COVID-19 treatment. In addition, genetically predicted ITGB5 transcript levels across multiple tissues showed a consistent negative association with three blood pressure phenotypes, which suggests antihypertensive potential. None of the 5 top targets were strongly associated with potentially acute comorbidities for COVID-19 treatment such as cardiac dysrhythmias or allergic diseases (excepting the potential beneficial effect of JAK2 on allergic diseases), which would have raised concerns about their suitability as COVID-19 targets.",

We pooled data on genetic associations with these drug targets from 4 recent molecular phenotype genome-side association studies (GWASs) (3)(10)(11)(12), identifying 353 drug targets for which there were reliable genetic predictors which could be used as instruments in MR.

Of these, potentially causal effects in 726 target-phenotype pairs were estimated with robust MR and colocalization evidence. These results provide evidence of on-target safety issues and/or beneficial effects of the COVID-19 drug targets.

It was proposed to reduce systemic inflammation by inhibiting JAK2 protein. In our study, we observed a putative causal effect of JAK2 expression on chronic hepatitis, which aligned with literature evidence of hepatitis B reactivation following ruxolitinib treatment (inhibitor of JAK2) (33) . Our phenome-wide association analysis further suggested that reducing the gene expression of JAK2 was not strongly associated with increased risk of acute conditions (cardiac dysrhythmias or allergic diseases). Although JAK2 reduction may increase weight and risk of inflammatory bowel disease, potential Baricitinib use for COVID-19 treatment will be short-term, and these side effects are probably inconsequential.",

Our evaluation of potential targets therefore excludes estimated effects of these targets on COVID-19 disease risk or progression. In the near future such data is likely to become available in a number of large-scale population-based biobanks across the world, including the UK Biobank, China Kadoorie Biobank (43), HUNT study (44), FinnGen (https://www.finngen.fi/fi), DeCODE (https://www.decode.com/) and the Million Veteran Program (45) . These biobanks are designed to study long-term health conditions, but with data linkage between these biobanks and electronic health records and/or COVID-19 data (as has recently happened with UK Biobank), these biobanks could be tremendous resources to rapidly generate genetic association data in epidemic and pandemic situations. The recent initial GWAS of COVID-19 found no GWAS hits, which highlight the importance of seriously considering potential bias of the data. When the unbiased data are available, the drug target information and the genetic predictors of the 353 drug targets we curated in this study as well as the drug target prioritization pipeline could provide even more valuable insights into the potential drug targets for infectious disease treatment. A second limitation is that the drug targets evaluated in this study were proxied using a limited number of instruments, which means the putative causal effects rely on one or two genetic instruments. Even though our results suggest some biological links between the target and diseases, these only provide evidence for the very first step of the drug development process. Finally, whilst these are plausible targets for COVID-19, we can't predict whether successful intervention would impact on risk of infection, progression/severity of disease or other disease characteristics relevant to public health (e.g. viral shedding).",

Our study provides both a statistical genetics pipeline and an openly available platform to prioritise potential COVID-19 targets on the basis of MR and existing trial evidence. The platform also evaluated repurposing opportunities for approved drugs on other indications. Our approach and platform will provide additional value once genetic association studies of COVID-19 are available in the near future.",
