This chapter addresses the global high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among women of childbearing age and infants and toddlers. Vitamin D status (nutritional and sun exposure) is assessed by measuring the transport form of vitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). Active hormonal form is synthesized in most tissues from 25(OH)D. Vitamin D status is associated with immune development and lung function. Clinical trials are needed to establish the link between vitamin D deficiency and susceptibility to respiratory tract infections.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "There is compelling evidence of a global problem of poor vitamin D status in expecting mothers and postnatal life; and even more critical, is the evidence showing the association of vitamin D deficiency with increased morbidity and mortality risks from respiratory infections. Viral and bacterial pneumonia kills more children than any other illness, accounting for 19% of all deaths in children less than five years of age worldwide; and under-nutrition, which includes vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency, has been implicated in 53% of all these deaths. Poor vitamin D status is a result of insufficient sunlight exposure and/or poor dietary intake. Greater understanding of the role of vitamin D deficiency in precipitating lung infections grew from the use of rodent models and observational and intervention studies in infants and toddlers. Vitamin D adequacy is important to maintaining the key protective mechanism of developing lungs since it mediates the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides, the lungs strongest defense against viral and bacterial pathogens. If vitamin D intervention currently under study in several clinical trials is proven successful, then implementation of new fortification practices, revised guidelines for healthy sun exposure and public health programs for vitamin D supplementation of pregnant/lactating women and their infants may be effective strategies to aide in preventing neonates and children under five from developing pneumonia.

The poorest vitamin D status occurs in exclusively breast fed infants who are not supplemented with vitamin D. In contrast, formula fed infants have lower prevalence of vitamin D deficiency; however, older toddlers have limited access to vitamin D-rich foods. Children with Fitzpatrick skin types II to IV, in the northern and southern United States can only achieve a minimum amount of vitamin D from sun exposure during the summer months if they do not wear sunscreen at all except during beach vacations. Dark-skinned (skin types \u2265 V), children fall short of achieving their needs for vitamin D from sun exposure year round. In vivo animal and in vitro models provide evidence that vitamin D deficiency in utero is associated with altered lung development and immune functions, and increasing postnatal susceptibility to respiratory infections. Adequate vitamin D is critical for the production of anti-microbial peptides such as cathelicidin and Betadefensins that are key protective mechanisms in preventing respiratory infections in children under five years of age.

During the winter when adequate sunlight is limited for synthesis, there is greater dependency on dietary intake and thus the term 'vitamin' meaning essential nutrient was applied to this sunshinederived hormone. Since vitamin D occurs naturally in a limited number of foods, fortified foods such as milk and milk products, margarines, and breakfast cereals constitute the major dietary sources of the two forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) in the US and Canada (Calvo et al., 2004) . After absorption or synthesis, vitamin D2 or D3 is transported by vitamin D binding protein to the liver where the enzyme 25-hydroxylase converts it to 25(OH)D. This intermediary metabolite circulates and delivers the precursor to the active or hormonal form of vitamin D to different tissues. In this capacity, plasma 25(OH)D serves as the main status indicator for vitamin D. The mitochondrial enzyme, 1\u03b1-hydroxylase converts 25(OH)D to the active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH) 2 D (Holick, 2007) . Renal tissues are thought to be the major source of circulating levels of 1,25(OH) 2 D, but most extra-renal tissues including the immune and airway epithelial cells constitutively or upon activation express 1\u03b1-hydroxylase and can produce 1,25(OH) 2 D (Hansdottir and Monick, 2011) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 185, "end": 211, "text": "(MacLaughlin et al., 1982)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 763, "end": 783, "text": "(Calvo et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1268, "end": 1282, "text": "(Holick, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1537, "end": 1566, "text": "(Hansdottir and Monick, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Vitamin D has pleiotropic functions, and is involved in the regulation of approximately 1000 human genes (Tavera-Mendoza and White, 2007) , including genes associated with immune responses and lung development.

Although serum 25(OH)D levels of at least 25 nmol/l prevents rickets, it has been proposed by some investigators that concentrations around 80 nmol/l (32 ng/ml) are optimal, since these levels lead to the greatest calcium absorption and the highest bone mass (Bischoff-Ferrari et al., 2006; Dawson-Hughes, 2008) and are associated with better health outcomes involving non-skeletal tissue (Hollis, 2011 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 578, "end": 589, "text": "(IOM, 2011)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 846, "end": 857, "text": "(IOM, 2011)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1119, "end": 1150, "text": "(Bischoff-Ferrari et al., 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1171, "text": "Dawson-Hughes, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1249, "end": 1262, "text": "(Hollis, 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Vitamin D status and dietary guidelines during pregnancy and early childhood"}, {"text": "An accurate determination of the overall dietary requirements for maintaining vitamin D adequacy is impossible because of substantial variation in skin synthesis due to season, location, age, duration of exposure, pollution, skin pigmentation and exposed area, and use of sun screen.

With insufficient evidence to develop an RDA in infants, an adequate intake of 400 IU (10 \u03bcg) was proposed to ensure vitamin D nutritional adequacy in this population. The IOM derives the RDA from an EAR, which was determined for vitamin D for the first time in 2011. From a public health perspective the EAR (400 IU or 10 \u03bcg/d for individuals >1 year) is used to evaluate the nutrient intake adequacy of a population at the 50 th percentile (median) level of intake for all age groups (Whiting and Calvo, 2011 ). There appears to be global variation in recommended vitamin D intake guidelines for pregnant women, infants and toddlers (Table 16 .1).

Based on a National Human Activity Pattern Survey it has been estimated from the outdoor-sunlight data that US women including those of child-bearing age (22-40 years) get lower annual UVB doses than males because they spend less time outdoors (Godar, 2001; Godar et al., 2001) . In the US, 29% of African-American pregnant women and 5% of Caucasian pregnant women residing in the northern latitudes are vitamin D deficient (defined as serum 25(OH)D less than 37.5 nmol/l); whereas 54% of African-American participants and 47% of Caucasian participants are vitamin D insufficient (defined as serum 25(OH)D 37.5-80 nmol/l) (Bodnar et al., 2007) .
