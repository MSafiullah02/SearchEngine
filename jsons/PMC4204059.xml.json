By collaborating with the Khanh Hoa Health Service Department, we could obtain access to the hospital and also the community/commune health centers.

The west, north, and south are surrounded by mountains. The population is living mainly in the center area and there is only one hospital, Khanh Hoa General Hospital (KHGH) which is providing hospital care in this area.

We also collected the disease burden and health-seeking behavior information such as if the child gets ARI, what do you do? Do you go to the polyclinic, do you go to the private clinic, do you go to the hospital or do you just buy some drugs and stay at home or you just use traditional medicine? By asking those questions, it gives us an idea that how much proportion of the population is actually going to the hospital and what was happening in the community. We did the population census and disease burden survey, and obtained the hospital database from KHGH. Vietnam introduced digitalized hospital database system in 2003. Therefore we could obtain ICD-10 coded database from the hospital in this region. After we conducted this census survey, we were able to link the two databases and then analyzed it to address different health-related research questions.",

In the study area, this population density was typical of villages and some peri-urban areas. Scan statistics showed that areas with a high population density or adequate water supply did not experience severe outbreaks. The risk of dengue was higher in rural compared to urban areas, largely explained by lack of piped water supply, and in human population densities more often falling within the critical range. Mathematical modeling suggests that simple assumptions regarding area-level vector/host ratios may explain the occurrence of outbreaks. Thus we concluded from this study that improving water supply and vector control in areas with a human population density critical for dengue transmission could increase the efficiency of dengue control efforts. This was a very unique analysis and published in PLOS Medicine [6] which is a very good journal.",

It was difficult to interpret the etiology based on the limited blood culture result. High rate 60% or 70% of antibiotic usage before coming to the hospital may be the most likely reason for this low blood culture positive rate. We thought that even the bacteria or the organism died, by using the molecular based methods like PCR, we should be able to amplify the nucleic acid of the pathogen, measure the copy number and it should be related to the disease etiology. Therefore, we set up a multiplex PCR assay to identify 13 different respiratory viruses (influenza A, B, RSV, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza 1-4, rhinovirus, coronaviruses OC43, 229E, adeno and boca viruses) and 3 different bacterial pathogens including Streptococcal pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.",

If you can select a good study site, you can have advantages of efficiently monitoring the situation.(ii)Acquisition of skillful staff is also very important. Since Nha Trang field staffs are very well trained and they have experience in conducting various field and hospital based studies, we could achieve a very good outcome.(iii)Vietnam itself has an excellent up-to-down administration system. In the healthcare system, if you look from the lower level, they have primary healthcare system and then they have polyclinics, they have district hospital and provincial hospital. The health care system functions very efficiently too. In addition, Vietnam also has a good hospital database system which was very helpful for us.(iv)Another advantage is health care cost for children under 6 years, which is free of charge and then access to the hospital in our area is good. Within 30 minutes, the whole area can get to their healthcare facility.",

Since the study area is large, it requires a huge budget for this regular update.(ii)Community and hospital database matching; when we try to match these databases, but we can never get 100%. The maximum is 70%. Why? When they hospitalize, sometimes they give a different name, nickname or they give a different address like their relative\u2019s addresses rather than a correct one, so we could not link it correctly. We still we need to find way to improve this process.(iii)Low rate of diseases observed in low social economic class; Nha Trang is a kind of middle-class socioeconomic status, there are limited number of cases related to low-socioeconomic class like severe malnutrition, severe diseases, so it is not good to study such kind of diseases in our study area.(iv)Every year, the socioeconomic status is going up in the region and since the living cost is rising year by year, local staffs are demanding more and more salary. That\u2019s also a big burden to continue to maintain this large study site.",
