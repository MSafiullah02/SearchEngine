Pederin is found in some beetles, e.g., Paederus fuscipes\n, and structurally is considered a polyketide that bears vesicant and potent antitumor properties. Although pederin has weak antibacterial properties, it is severely toxic to eukaryotic cells. This property likely stems from its ability to block protein synthesis and cell division. There is significant evidence indicating that pederin is synthesized by a bacterial symbiont of host beetles, perhaps a close relative to P. aeruginosa [10]. This finding raises the possibility of culturing bacteria to generate a large quantity of pederin for therapeutic use or chemical modification to enhance pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics. Currently, however, isolating a practical quantity of pederin from biological sources remains challenging. Approximately 220 lb, or 25 million insects, were needed to extract enough pederin for structural analysis (Scheme 32.1).",

This technique utilizes \u03b1-D-glucopyranoside as the starting material. In the early 1990s a multi-step sequence for developing this significant portion of the mycalamide structure was published [11, 12]. The basic synthetic strategy involves an alteration of the previously published methodology [13, 14]. The conjugation method to produce total mycalamide required the activation of pederate, the left portion of the molecule, with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride/DMAP/dichloromethane at room temperature followed by treatment with the amines produced by hydrogenation of azides. In Roush\u2019s method, an excellent chiral precursor, methyl 7-benzoylpederate, is used to effectively control the stereoselectivity of the coupling strategy for generation of the amide bridge [15\u201318]. An alternative approach to synthesize methyl pederic acid involves 7-O\u2212(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl) pederate, an intermediate in Kishi\u2019s synthesis of mycalamides A and B and onnamide A [11, 12]. Scheme 32.2 depicts this significantly diastereoselective synthesis. Incorporation of the exo methylene moiety involves use of the very important Takai-Nozaki protocol (CH2I2, TiCl4, Zn, THF).",

One key step in the method is the mismatched aldol reaction of the imide and aldehyde. This step yielded a ca. 5:4 mixture of two isomeric aldols, with incorrect C-7 stereochemistry. Enrichment of the isomeric mixture to mycalamide A required epimerization of C-7 at the beta-keto imide step. A divergent and effective approach involves Swern style oxidation of the isomeric mixture of aldols. This approach proceeds under reaction conditions that minimize C-7 epimerization, selectively yielding 7-epi-mycalamide.",

The deprotection steps to complete the approach required the use of t-butyl ammonium fluoride (TBAF) in a tetrahydrofuran solution followed by a hydrolytic quench with lithium hydroxide in methanol. This strategy resulted in formation of total pederin with a marked 88 % yield (Scheme 32.4).

Mycalamide-A exhibited promising in vivo anti-viral activity against the A59 coronavirus in mice [2]. Furthermore, mycalamides A and B and onnamide showed anti-cancer properties in vitro and in vivo in mice and human tumor cells at concentrations ranging from 5 to 200 nM and 2.5 to 10 \u00b5g/kg [61]. All three compounds were shown to inhibit protein synthesis, some at low nanomolar concentrations [61, 62]. Mycalamides A and B exhibited the ability to convert transformed rat kidney epithelial cells (NRK) back to their normal morphology, possibly through selective inhibition of protein synthesis [63]. More recently, Dyshlovoy et al. showed that mycalamide A was able to block epidermal growth factor-induced cancerous transformation of a murine epidermal cell line (JB6 Cl41 P(+)), and induce apoptosis at subnanomolar concentrations, possibly through inhibition of NF-kB and AP-1 nuclear transcription factors [64]. Richter et al. showed that synthetic congeners of mycalamide-B, i.e., 18-O-methyl mycalamide-B and 10-epi-18-O-methyl mycalamide-B, exhibited anti-proliferative effects against carcinomas [65]. Specific cell lines that demonstrate susceptibility to mycalamide A, mycalamide B, or onnamide include murine lymphoma P388 cells, HL-60, HT-29, and A549 human tumor cells, and leukemia cells [61\u201363, 65]. Mycalamide-A is also active against B16 melanoma, Lewis lung carcinoma, M5076 ovarian sarcoma, colon26 carcinoma, and the human MX-1, CX-1, and Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma tumor xenografts [61].",

In addition, these agents have potential in alleviating patients with autoimmune disorders. It is also of potential utility that mycalamide A does not appear to be a substrate for the major drug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (MDR1/ABCB1).

[47] from marine sponge Psammocina species and Crews et al. [46] from Ircinia ramose species in 2004. It has been recently documented that psymberin is rather produced by the symbiotic bacteria associated with the marine sponges and not by marine sponges themselves [10]. Psymberin structural features closely resemble that of other pederin family members including mycalamide A. In general, psymberin lacks the commonly present acetal-containing pederate side chain, but is identified with a dihydroisocoumarin unit that is not widely found with other members of pederin family. The activity of pysmberin on various human cancer cell lines is listed in Table 32.1. Out of the 60 cell lines tested, psymberin displayed a differential cytotoxicity profile and was more potent against colon cancer, melanoma and breast cancer cell lines. Several research groups have attempted to synthesize this fascinating marine drug owing to its complex structure, limited natural abundance and biological properties [59]. Huang et al. reported several analogues of psymberin which were constructed by modifying the tetradhydropyran ring core of psymberin. All the analogues (1, 1A, 1B, 1C) were biologically tested using major human cancer cell lines to identify their IC50 values (Table 32.3). Compound 1(C11-Deoxypsymberin) was found to be most potent of all the analogues and its potency was 3 to 10 fold more compared to psymberin or its epimer [57]. Modifications of 1 further revealed high potency against the HOP62 human lung cancer cell line [57] (Fig. 32.1).",

Psymberin and its two epimers 8-epipsymebrin and 4-epipsymberin exhibited meaningful IC50 values whose values were relatively lower when compared to the two hybrids that were synthesized with a dimethoxy unit instead of dihydroisocoumarin unit. The structural variations of psymberin and its epimers when compared with the two hybrids indicate that retention of dihydroisocoumarin unit is essential for the biological activity of psymberin [70]. Furthermore, it was revealed that structural alterations of psymberin could result in decreased cellular uptake of these compounds in HeLa cells compared to psymberin [70]. After incubation of HeLa cells with 100 nM of psymberin and its epimers, the intra-cellular concentration of psymberinepimers (4-epi & 8-epi) was about 20-fold less than pysmberin and the intra-cellular concentration of psympederin was below the limit of detection [70]. The same study [70] employing forward genetic screen in C. elegans identified that ribosome was the primary target for psymberin and also demonstrated that in contrast to other pederins, psymberin does not exhibit blistering activity due to the absence of acetal group. Most recently, Pietruszka group synthesized 8-desmethoxy pysmberin, a putative biosynthetic precursor of psymberin in 25 steps whose biological activity is yet to be determined [58].",

In addition, recent advancements in the synthetic approaches to these compounds have improved their total synthesis. These compounds and their derivatives have been evaluated for their biological activities and are proven to be very effective in extremely low concentrations. Potent cytotoxicity was observed when various cancer cell lines were treated with mycalamides, psymberin, and their analogs in the lower nanomolar range. Similarly, mycalamides have also demonstrated antiviral properties and T-cell-modulating potential. Hence, advances with this class of natural products exemplify the power of an interdisciplinary approach to drug discovery. The design of newly functionalized analogs, with potent anticancer, antiviral, and immunosuppressive activity, can now be realized.",
