The truth is that marketing and recruitment for our specialty has always been somewhat challenging, mostly because of radiology's absence in the required medical school curriculum. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, only 16% of medical schools required a dedicated radiology clerkship in the 2018-2019 academic year [7]. Without broad access to students, our specialty has been relegated to the sidelines while others have controlled our narrative, primarily medical students and physicians from other specialties [8]. This has allowed misconceptions to run rampant for decades, including for example, that radiology is a specialty occurring far from patient care areas, that it offers trainees little opportunity for social interaction, and that it is a specialty better suited for men.",

These students are never told why radiology would make an excellent career choice for them, but instead learn about the so-called \u201clifestyle metrics\u201d that DR is purported to offer. One study revealed that the top three attitudes medical students associate with radiology are \u201cregular hours, excellent salary, and lots of free time\u201d [9]. Perception of these lifestyle metrics, coupled with the presence of a strong radiology job market, make DR popular as a backup choice for many students, especially those vying for the truly competitive specialties in the match.",

This includes medical students hedging their bets by applying to radiology when their true aspirations are the ultra-competitive fields of ophthalmology, dermatology, or the surgical subspecialties. It includes students who fail to match into competitive specialties and are faced with scrambling into unfilled radiology positions. It also includes countless surgical interns and residents looking to leave their programs and transfer into DR, their stories all quite familiar to PDs. Indeed, radiology program directors receive unsolicited emails nearly every week from clinical residents looking to leave their programs. To be clear, DR is the beneficiary of these talented trainees, but we must dig deeper to understand why such a substantial fraction of our most competitive applicants consider radiology only as their second career choice.",

In an attempt to avoid a catastrophic number of unmatched students in the first year of the integrated IR match (2016-2017), the leadership of the Association of Program Directors in Radiology made an eleventh-hour recommendation that applicants also apply to DR programs at institutions hosting IR residencies, as they could provide alternate pathways to IR [10]. While the solution was meant as a stop-gap measure to prevent disaster during the first IR recruitment season, it has become the default strategy for subsequent classes of students applying to integrated IR, as expansion of IR positions in the match has been too slow to accommodate student interest. This represents a large and relatively new subset of students using radiology as their \u201cplan B\u201d - applying to DR but preferring another specialty on their rank lists.",

An impressive 18-24% of US allopathic seniors applying to DR have ranked at least one other specialty higher on their rank lists since the 2017 match [11]. Additionally, DR consistently has among the highest \u201caverage number of ranked applicants required to fill its positions\u201d in the match. As explained in the NRMP data report, this metric is a rough measure of specialty competitiveness, with larger numbers indicating less competitive specialties [11]. For radiology programs to successfully fill their positions in the match, they must filter through all the applicants who've only applied only as a backup, a process which elevates this metric.",

Program directors have perhaps best understood this difficult truth: the impressive application numbers we receive each year are buoyed by a substantial number of outstanding applicants who ultimately rank other specialties higher on their rank lists. It's vital that as a specialty we ground ourselves in this truth and work harder to directly market radiology to medical students. For when it comes to recruitment, radiology should be considered a fair-weathered specialty, requiring a strong economy and robust radiology job market to maintain its competitive edge [12,13]. The 2008 recession serves as a case study in just how quickly applicants will pivot to other specialties at the first sign of economic uncertainty [6].",

Lack of an effective treatment or vaccine therapy threatens a protracted period of social distancing and shuttering of our economy. The extent to which radiology will be affected by the economic decline is still uncertain, although some projections show a substantial potential impact on radiology business, salaries, and the overall job market [14]. As recent history has taught us, the economic fallout of COVID-19 is likely to affect near- and intermediate-term radiology recruitment, starting as early as the next radiology match in 2021. Programs should immediately begin contingency planning for drops in both application numbers and the nationwide match rate. Mitigation may be possible with assertive departmental outreach focused on educating local medical students about why radiology is an excellent career choice for them. Messaging should seek to establish a positive and realistic narrative, highlighting our specialty's many strengths while at the same time dispelling the common misconceptions [8].",
