            "text": "Introduction: In the event of an outbreak of a communicable respiratory illness, quarantine may become necessary. The New York Institute for All Hazard Preparedness (NYIAHP) of the State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center, in cooperation with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Healthcare Emergency Preparedness Program, (NYC DOHMH-HEPP) quarantine working group, has developed a series of clinical protocols to help health care facilities respond to such an event. Problem: Two full-scale exercises (FSEs) were designed and conducted a year apart in the quarantine unit at Kings County Hospital Center (KCHC) to test the efficacy and feasibility of these quarantine protocols. The goal of these exercises was to identify the gaps in preparedness for quarantine and increase hospital readiness for such an event. Methods: Evaluators monitored for efficient management of critical physical plants, personnel and material resources. Players were expected to integrate and practice emergency response plans and protocols specific to quarantine. In developing the exercise objectives, five activities were selected for evaluation: Activation of the Unit, Staffing, Charting/Admission, Symptom Monitoring and Infection Control, and Client Management. Results: The results of the initial FSE found that there were incomplete critical tasks within all five protocols: These deficiencies were detailed in an After Action Report and an Improvement Plan was presented to the KCHC Disaster Preparedness Committee a month after the initial FSE. In the second FSE a year later, all critical tasks for Activation of the unit, Staffing and Charting/Admission were achieved. Completion of critical tasks related to Symptom Monitoring and Infection Control and Client Management was improved in the second FSE, but some tasks were still not performed appropriately. Conclusion: In short, these exercises identified critical needs in disaster preparedness of the KCHC Quarantine Unit. The lessons learned from this logistical exercise enabled the planning group to have a better understanding of leadership needs, communication capabilities, and infection control procedures. Kings County Hospital Center performed well during these exercises. It was clear that performance in the second exercise was improved, and many problems noted in the first exercise were corrected. Staff also felt better prepared the second time. This supports the idea that frequent exercises are vital to maintain disaster readiness.",

The length of quarantine is based on the incubation period of the illness. Isolation, on the other hand, is a well-accepted practice, as it involves the containment of ill and symptomatic patients to prevent spread of disease to those around them, and is based on the duration of communicability.",

Ships arriving from infected ports in Venice were required to anchor for forty days before landing. 2 The practice of quarantine had fallen out of favor over the last 50 years because it was considered socially unacceptable and inhumane to imprison a healthy individual. The advent of vaccines and antimicrobials also provided governing bodies alternatives to containing the spread of infectious agents. Recent events have sparked renewed interest in quarantine including the increased fear of bioterrorism after 9/11, the 2003 SARS outbreak and, most recently, the fear of pandemic H1N1 influenza.",

The quarantine system is made up of USA quarantine stations located at 20 ports of entry and land-border crossings where international travelers arrive. Medical and public health officers employed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) work together at these stations to respond to reports of illness, screen cargo, inspect animal products and collect medical information from new immigrants, refugees, and asylum and parole seekers wishing to enter USA. 3 During an infectious disease emergency, these quarantine stations will have to team with local public health departments and provide strategic leadership. 4 Quarantine is used to contain and restrict well individuals who may have been exposed to an infectious illness in order to monitor them for signs and symptoms of the infection for a period of one incubation period. Certain exposures such as illness on an airplane with foreign travelers, a bioterrorist attack at a small venue, or exposure to an unknown agent where close observation of exposed individuals is needed to learn about the infection may require quarantine in a designated hospital unit. Quarantine is not a routine hospital procedure and therefore even those health care centers specifically designated for this task may find themselves poorly prepared to handle such a situation. There are few studies in the literature that examine the preparedness of these designated hospital units.",

The physicians assigned to the unit were available by pager but not physically present at all times which caused confusion in decision making as there was no authoritative final decision maker present at all times. In the second exercise, an additional clerk was assigned to the unit, and at least one attending physician was present on the unit at all times. These additions rectified the problems described above. Staffing group leaders did not wear clearly visible identification in the first exercise. In the second exercise staffing group leaders were more clearly identified by vests and large tags describing their titles. There was an excessive number of security staff on the unit for both exercises, which created a threatening environment for patients as was mentioned in several actor evaluation forms.",

In the second exercise, a more organized approach to patient interactions was developed, in which medical staff would enter the room together.

            "text": "Both FSEs were conducted in the Quarantine Unit at Kings County Hospital Center (KCHC) in Brooklyn, New York. Kings County Hospital Center is a tertiary care hospital with a level 1 trauma center and 627 hospital beds. The hospital serves approximately 2.6 million residents from Brooklyn and Staten Island. The unit was renovated in 2006 specifically as an isolation unit, and then identified as a quarantine space. It has not been in operation since completion in June 2006. The unit can house 26 patients; all of the rooms have negative pressure capability and an anteroom. Description The first FSE was on April 23, 2009 and the second on April 22, 2010. The background scenario of the exercise involves the detection of an individual suspected to have Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome associated coronavirus infection (SARS-coV) on a private jet in eastern US airspace, returning from Hong Kong. All other passengers on this flight are asymptomatic. The CDC Division of Global Migration and Quarantine employees at John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene deem it necessary to quarantine the asymptomatic passengers due to the exposure. Prior to this event, KCHC received numerous mock health alerts detailing the identification of a novel and highly pathogenic strain of corona virus in Southern China with pandemic potential.",
