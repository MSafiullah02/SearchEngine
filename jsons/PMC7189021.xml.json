Most of the sufferers worked or lived around the local Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where live animals were on sale. Extreme acute respiratory infection signs occurred in the early stages of this pneumonia, with some sufferers quickly developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe breathing failure, and other significant complications. On January 7, 2020, a single coronavirus was detected from a patient\u2019s throat swab sample by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) and was eventually called COVID-19 by the World Health Organization (WHO) (Ji et al. 2020). This virus has now caused a total of 750,890 confirmed human infections worldwide, with 36,405 deaths (WHO Situation report - 71, 31 March 2020 2020). The whole world looks forward to some kind of relief and treatment for this serious pandemic.",

COVID-19 is a category 2B \u03b2 CoV with a genetic sequence similarity of more than 70% to SARS-nCoV (Hui et al. 2020). The origins of the new infection with coronavirus was ascertained as bats. With full genome sequences, Zhou and colleagues found that the virus is 96% the same as a bat coronavirus at the level of the entire genome (Zhou et al. 2020). Wu and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis of the entire viral genome and deduced that the virus was most closely associated with a group of previously isolated SARS-like coronaviruses from bats in China (Wu et al. 2020).",
