He had no other neurological findings at examination, including symmetrical and normal force, sensitivity, reflexes, ocular movements and a normal gait. His chest plate showed significant improvement of pneumonia (Image 2.) and He had no remarkable laboratory findings besides CSF data. Brain CT and MRI were performed without any acute pathological findings and an image guided lumbar puncture demonstrated mildly elevated levels of proteins (44 mg/dL), absent leukocytes and a negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on CSF. Our patient completed treatment for SARS-CoV-2 adequately and did not present lifethreatening signs at any time; He was treated with low dose oral prednisone and after two weeks He started with a barely notable improvement on both sides.",

According to previously described GBS variants we propose it as a DP, clinically coherent with the diagnostic criteria for DP by Wakerly et al. GBS is a peripheral nervous system disorder that presents as a rapidly progressive, ascending, flaccid paralysis with diminished or absent reflexes. The disease is often triggered by infectious processes. Campylobacter jejuni infection is the most commonly identified precipitant of GBS. Some viruses like Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and Zika have also been associated with GBS. 9 GBS used to be considered a single entity characterized by lymphocytic inflammation and peripheral nervous system demyelination. Now, It is usually clinically defined as a more diverse disorder divisible into several patterns and with various clinical manifestations. One proposed clinical variant is facial diplegia. 10 According to diagnostic criteria proposed by Wakerly et al. (2015) 6 our case accomplishes bifacial symmetrical weakness, absence of limb, neck or ocular weakness, an antecedent of prior infectious disease in the previous 3 days to 6 weeks and albuminocytological dissociation in CSF. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 infection might have triggered this atypical clinical variant of GBS in our patient.",
