The pathogenesis and mode of transmission of MERS-CoV and influenza A H7N9 are still poorly understood, which hampers implementation of intervention and preventive measures. Furthermore, the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens, for which treatment options are diminishing, are of major global concern. These intricate and complex relations between microbes, human and animal hosts, and environmental factors influence risk, exposure, pathogenicity, infectiousness, and transmissibility. Furthermore, microorganisms do not respect international boundaries, and ease of global travel and airborne spread make them a persistent threat to global health security.8\n",

Other important challenges to the improvement of management outcomes of respiratory tract infections are development of tests for prediction and monitoring of treatment response; rapid identification of drug resistant pathogens; more widespread surveillance of infections, locally and internationally; and those viruses with pandemic potential that require a global response. The fourth article12 reviews the present portfolio of diagnostic tests and technological advances that are enabling progress to be made in development of near point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests for viral and bacterial respiratory tract infections, including drug-resistant tuberculosis. The emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant infections for which diminishing treatment options are available is of major global concern. The fifth article13 focuses on development and use of new antimicrobial agents and immune-based and host-directed therapies for a range of conventional and emerging viral respiratory tract infections.",

Although much has been learned from previous outbreaks, present surveillance systems have their inherent weaknesses, and recent experiences with MERS-CoV14 show that pandemic preparedness still faces major political and scientific challenges.15 An important priority for control of infectious disease is to ensure that scientific and technological advances in molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics are well integrated into public health. More effective and wider partnerships based on equity and best ethical practice, across governments, health care, academia, industry, and with the public, are essential to effectively galvanise economic, political and scientific measures required to develop core capacities, including legislation, national focal points, and pandemic planning to reduce risk of global spread and reduce the burden of respiratory tract infectious diseases. An urgent need exists to establish trusting and effective meaningful collaborations between countries to tackle new emerging microbial threats. This will facilitate early and rapid detection of potential pandemic infectious diseases through public health actions within the framework of the International Health Regulations.16\n",
