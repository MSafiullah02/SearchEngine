The risk is high because most vaccine candidates fail in preclinical or early clinical development and less than 1 in 15 vaccine candidates entering Phase II achieves licensure. The high failure rate is the result of a variety of reasons:1.Not fully understanding the biology of protection.2.Lack of good animal models to predict vaccine behavior in humans.3.Unpredictability of human immune system reactions to antigens as it relates to immunogenicity or safety.4.The unpredictability of the impact of combining multiple components in a vaccine.\n",

Assay development involves the definition of specific methods to test the purity of raw materials, stability and potency of the vaccine product, and immunologic and other criteria to predict vaccine efficacy. Go/no-go decisions must be made at each stage of clinical and process development and must be data driven. Clinical, process, and assay development tasks must be closely integrated. Clinical development involves studies of the effects of vaccines on patients for safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy through a staged process: phase 1, early safety and immunogenicity in small numbers; phase 2, safety, dose ranging, and immunogenicity in 200 to 400 individuals; sometimes phase 2b, nonlicensure, proof-of-concept trials for efficacy; and phase 3, safety and efficacy trials that permit licensure, which generally require thousands of subjects.",

Bulk manufacturing includes cell culture and/or fermentation-based manufacturing followed by a variety of separation processes to purify the vaccine. The finishing operations include formulation with adjuvant/stabilizer followed by vial or syringe filling (including lyophilization in the case of live viral vaccines) followed by labeling, packaging, and controlled storage. Process development may be as costly as clinical development and is critically important to the overall success of a vaccine development program. As development proceeds toward licensure, costs escalate as clinical studies become larger, manufacturing scales up, and facilities must be built. Postlicensure studies of safety and efficacy (phase 4) of vaccines are essential and represent a large additional cost. It is important to note that, unlike pharmaceuticals, vaccines that pass early proof-of-concept studies in humans have a very high probability of achieving licensure.",

With few exceptions, each vaccine requires a different plant because of unique manufacturing requirements and the regulatory difficulties associated with changing over to a different product. Some processes are scalable, such as bacterial or yeast fermentation, so that increasing the size of the manufacturing unit (i.e., fermenter) will greatly increase the yield; unit cost will decrease with volume increase. Other manufacturing processes, for example, those dependent on viral growth in embryonated hen eggs or cell lines, are not scalable. Additional plants or modules within plants must be built to increase the throughput, so unit costs do not appreciably decrease with volume increases. Despite the complexity of bulk vaccine manufacturing, 3 to 5 years post\u2013product launch, the fully burdened bulk cost of production for most of the older vaccines declines to as little as $0.50 to $1.00 per dose, and significant elements of product cost are primarily driven by activities related to filling, vialing, and packaging (Table 4.2\n).

Approximately 50% of the cost is for construction; the remainder is the cost of capital interest. These numbers have been debated (others estimate $100 million to $200 million); however, the higher estimates have been validated in two ways. First, the number of new vaccines brought to licensure annually by a company or the industry is very small compared with other products, and correlates with R&D expenditures of $600 million to $800 million for each new product. Thus, if a company spends $100 million annually for vaccine R&D, one might expect one new product every 6 to 8 years, and this appears to hold true. Second, biotechnology companies that are focused on one vaccine and have successfully brought it to market have spent $500 million to $700 million on R&D as exemplified by the development of the live attenuated influenza vaccine by Aviron, now Medimmune. In summary, vaccine development from concept to licensure is a lengthy process as illustrated by timelines for some of the currently licensed vaccines (Table 4.3\n).",

There is no federal vaccine program for adults, although Medicare does reimburse for influenza and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Historically, many adults with private insurance were not covered for immunizations.

Clinical development that will satisfy FDA standards is also done mostly by the large companies, performed by academia and contract research organizations. Personnel and expertise in clinical research, regulatory affairs, data management, statistics, project management, and all other required disciplines also exist within the large companies.

In the case of H. influenzae type b (Hib), Praxis Biologics and Connaught Laboratories pioneered the development of Hib polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines.

The top four Western suppliers (see Table 4.1) account for approximately 85% of these sales; the remainder comes from regional vaccine companies, the largest of which are located in middle-income countries such as India, China, and Brazil (see Table 4.5). The top four companies are slowly losing market share in doses to the DCVMN sourced doses and when polio eradication is achieved their dose share will drop to less than 20% of worldwide dose volume. In the coming years, as the eradication of polio becomes a reality, the developing country manufacturers will phase out their oral polio vaccine production. However, the need for inactivated polio vaccine will grow as developing countries adopt it into their pediatric immunization plans. As the demand for injected polio vaccine grows in developing countries, alternative approaches for local production will be explored, including access to bulk injected polio vaccine, tech transfer by big pharma as a part of their strategic alliances in developing markets, and potential introduction of alternative injected polio vaccine strains such as the Sabin strain. Another key driver will be the expansion of vaccine markets in India, China, and Brazil. Vaccine uptake rates in India, China and Brazil are still low compared with western countries (e.g., India's flu vaccine uptake in 2014 was 1.0 million doses vs. 140 million doses in the United States).23, 24 The immunization rates are also expected to increase in other low-income countries, which will increase vaccine dose requirements substantially. Most of this demand in low-income countries is expected to be met by manufacturers of DCVMN network. As the DCVMN expands its role, one would expect significant downward pressure on vaccine prices.",
