            "text": "Radix Isatidis (Banlangen or Bei-Banlangen in Chinese) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) consisting of the dried root of Isatis indigotica Fort (Cruciferae). It was first recorded in Shen Nong's Herbal classic and has been used in China as an antipyretic and detoxifying herb for over 2000 years1, 2. Like many TCM, Radix Isatidis displays diverse pharmacological activities and exerts antibacterial3, 4, 5, antiviral6, 7, 8, 9, 10, antiinflammatory11, 12, antitumor13, 14, antiendotoxic15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 and immune regulatory effects24, 25, 26. In fact, these effects have translated into pronounced clinical success in the treatment and/or prevention of influenza, tonsillitis and malignant infectious diseases27, 28, 29, 30 particularly severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1-influenza31, 32, 33. It is now an established component of many TCM preparations such as Banlangen Granules and Qingkailing Injection which is widely used as antipyretic and antiviral drug in clinical practice.",

Recently, holistic chemical profiling of Radix Isatidis has been developed using HPLC41, 42 to determine eight bioactive constituents, including 5 glucosinolates and 3 nucleosides43.",

Chemical fingerprints based on the detection and simultaneous assay of five nucleosides and one glucosinolate were subjected to similarity analysis and partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) to evaluate the technique.
