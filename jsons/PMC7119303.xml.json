In fact, many governments have instead tried to control childbearing, at times through coercive programmes: China's one-child policy; sterilisation abuses in India during the 1975 \u201cemergency\u201d; re-emergence in India of provider targets and disincentive schemes; and the case of Peru (see page 68).",

The UN estimated in 2003, that one in three girls will be raped, beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime.5 Addressing the problem from a public-health perspective, WHO led a research effort, using rigorous and uniform methodology, to assess the prevalence and effect of such violence in Bangladesh, Brazil, Japan, Namibia, Peru, Tanzania, and Thailand. WHO has received requests from other countries interested in doing similar studies, but such work is contingent on the availability of funds.6 What is also needed is documentation of what works in prevention, follow-up care, and support. Factors contributing to violence, such as crossgenerational sex and child marriage, also require basic and applied research.7\n",

A study of maternal morbidity, which showed 17 cases of severe morbidity for each maternal death in rural India, was the only example cited for nearly two decades.9 In 1998, WHO estimated that ten cases of serious morbidity, some with lifelong effects, occur for each maternal death. Strong data on unsafe abortion, estimated to cause 13% of maternal deaths and substantial morbidity, are also lacking. Much remains to be learned about how best to support effective use of contraception, reduce unwanted pregnancies, improve access to safe abortions, and treat women with complications after unsafe procedures.10\n",

It recognised that vertical interventions, based largely on certain technologies or drugs, cannot address the social and behavioural determinants of sexual and reproductive health, nor are they suited for some core elements of health care, especially obstetric care. Health system capacity varies enormously, thus solutions must be tailored accordingly. For example:\u2022Research on what interventions work best in reducing maternal mortality is needed to establish what to scale up, and how, in different settings.13 Work is also needed on how best to address widespread but neglected maternal health problems, such as obstetric fistula (see page 71).\u2022Systematic needs assessments and operations research are required to establish which less-than-gold-standard interventions are safe and effective and under what conditions. A good example is work that shows the effectiveness of nevirapine to prevent parent-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS.14 Likewise, for cervical dysplasia, which kills more women than breast cancer in poor countries, further research is needed on how to do early detection, treatment, and follow-up in these settings.15\n\n",

Many governments, especially European ones, and bodies such as the World Bank have implemented ICPD sexual and reproductive health and rights commitments. A good example is a Bangladesh national programme designed by the government, civil society (especially women's health and rights advocates), and development partners. Together, these stakeholders reviewed the evidence on reproductive health and made hard choices about which services to prioritise, given the scarce funding available. They debated the importance of, and strategies for, outreach to adolescents, and the challenges of learning about sexuality, addressing violence against women, establishing a charter of patients' rights, and making obstetric services accessible. They made a difference. Between 1998 and 2002, the percentage of women in Bangladesh receiving antenatal care went from 26% to 47%, female life expectancy increased from 58 to 60 years, and female infant and under-five mortality rates fell. The most significant decline was in maternal mortality, which dropped from 410 per 100 000 livebirths to 320.17 The Bangladesh programme is not perfect, nor is its implementation, but by engaging all sectors of society, progress has been made.",
