In cattle there is usually minimal clinical disease, but these animals can remain viremic for months, and so serve as the main reservoir of infection.8 Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a segmented dsRNA virus in the Orbivirus genome, family Reoviridae. The disease is endemic in much of Africa and over large segments of the Americas, with distribution coinciding with the range of Culicoides spp., the responsible insect vector. The main Asian-African vector is Culicoides imicola. The disease has occurred in North Africa and the Middle East, making sporadic incursions into southern Europe, as Culicoides are easily transported on wind. The \u201cenvelope\u201d or range of usual C. imicola distribution includes the southernmost parts of Europe, which are the regions that have been sporadically affected by bluetongue over the last few decades. Farther north in Europe, there are other Culicoides species known as the Palearctic species, C. pulicaris and C. obsoletus. Although both had been proven to be capable of transmitting bluetongue experimentally, they were not functioning in the natural epidemiology of infection prior to 2008.",

It is hypothesized that the enhanced C. imicola population in southern Europe helped to fuel an outbreak. With expanding populations of C. imicola and the Palearctic species, there was more extensive overlap of these different species. A \u201chandover\u201d event occurred probably multiple times, in which the new host species picked up the virus from the endemic host. Once the virus was established within the Palearctic species, it was able to move to more northerly climes.11 The increased temperatures in these more northerly areas, especially the shortened winter period, ensured that the Palearctic species would survive through the season during which BTV would have otherwise been expected to die back. As a result, there was sustained transmission of the disease in new areas.",

Building of the Aswan dam in the years prior to this outbreak was probably an important factor as this hydrological project permitted controlled flooding of agricultural lands and subsequent enhanced mosquito habitats.16 Then, in 1987, there was another outbreak, this time across the continent to West Africa, in Mauritania. In this case, Rift Valley fever occurred subsequent to completion of the Diama dam on the Senegal river, another project that created increased standing water for mosquito amplification.17 In both of these cases, Egypt and Mauritania, there were human-induced changes to the environment, in the form of dam-building which created more standing water and therefore greater habitat possibilities for vectors of disease.",

In addition, most farms were often combining fruit production with the use of pig waste as fertilizer, resulting in many trees overhanging pigpens. Extensive slash and burn practices in the region and an extended dry season brought up by the ENSO promoted changes in migration patterns of the Pteropus bats to areas of plentiful food availability, the pig/fruit farms.31 It is believed that the combination of these production techniques, land use, and climate changes provided the ideal conditions for NiV's emergence in swine, from which it was aerosolized easily to humans. A unique set of factors brought two species with historically distinct ecological niches into close contact. Furthermore, the intense production practices allowed for a subtle introduction, circulation, and establishment of the virus into a new amplifying host, the pig. Retrospective serologic studies indicate that the first human cases in Malaysia predated the 1997 outbreak, indicating that the virus may have been circulating at low levels prior to the known emergence. The intensive management (high turnover of piglets) likely allowed a small amount of virus in select pigs to be widely circulated through transport and extensive sales associated with the rapidly developing intensive swine industry. As more animals became infected, there was increased possibility for transmission to people, and an outbreak occurred in the human population.32 Recent outbreaks in India and Bangladesh have been attributed to direct contact with the bat's body fluids.24, 33\n",
