Briefly, the open reading frames were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified using primers based on the GenBank sequences V01555, AJ507799, and U756981. The bacterial artificial chromosome plasmids Akata BXI (EBV) and BAC36 (KSHV) [26] were used as templates (gifts from L. Hutt-Fletcher and S-J Gao). PCR products were cloned into the vector pDONR201. ORFs representing different virus strains were amplified directly from clinical samples or from cell lines. Proteins containing extensive repeats that limited expression in yeast (eg, EBNA1 and LANA) were amplified as N-terminal and C-terminal fragments. Escherichia coli bacteria were transformed with the reaction products and DNA prepared for sequence verification. Correct ORF-containing plasmid DNAs were then moved into a yeast destination vector, pEGH-A, a derivative of the yeast glutathione S-transferase (GST) vector, pEGH. Yeast cultures were induced with 2% galactose, and GST fusion proteins were isolated and purified on glutathione beads. One hundred and seventy-four appropriately sized EBV and KSHV proteins (Supplementary Data; available online) were successfully purified based on immunoblot analysis using anti-GST antibody and were printed using a 48-pin contact printer (Bio-Rad) in duplicate on modified glass (Full Moon Biosystems) microscope slides along with controls. Each slide had 784 spots: 348 EBV and KSHV proteins, 112 control proteins (Supplementary Data; available online), and 324 blank spots. The controls were used for orientation and to detect nonspecific interaction with proteins such as the GST fusion partner. Protein arrays were stored at \u221280\u00b0C.",

Plasma was incubated with the protein arrays at dilutions of 1:10 000 and 1:100. Analysis of the KSHV antigens detected on the arrays (Figure 2A) revealed that none of the healthy normal or HIV-negative lymphoma patient plasma specimens that were tested reacted with the array proteins at either the 1:100 or 1:10 000 dilutions. However, positive signals were seen with the plasma from HIV-positive individuals with KS. The antigens most frequently detected at 1:10 000 dilution were ORF73C (10/15; 66% positive) and ORF38 (10/15; 66% positive). ORF38 is a tegument protein that has not been widely examined as an antigen. ORF73 encodes the latency LANA protein that is a gold standard for KSHV serology studies. The central region of LANA contains repeated sequences that limit effective expression of the protein in yeast. The N-terminus and C-terminus of LANA were therefore expressed separately for presentation on the array. The LANA C-terminus was recognized more frequently than the N-terminus (14 vs 4 positive plasma). This is consistent with a peptide mapping study that found more sera reacting to peptides mapping to the LANA C-terminus than to the N-terminus [28]. The median number of KSHV antigens recognized by the LANA-positive HIV+/KS plasma at 1:10 000 serum dilution was 6.",

EBV is a ubiquitous virus, and EBV proteins on the array were recognized using plasma from healthy donors, HIV\u2212 lymphoma patients, and HIV+/KS patients (Figure 2B). The median number of EBV proteins recognized at 1:100 serum dilution was 17, 18, and 27 for plasma from healthy donors, lymphoma patients, and HIV+/KS patients, respectively. Ninety-one percent of plasma specimens tested (32/35) reacted with the carboxy terminus of EBNA1 and 97% (34/35) reacted with the combination of EBNA3B and EBNA3C at 1:100 or 1:10 000 dilution. The single EBNA3-negative plasma specimen was from a lymphoma patient whose plasma did not recognize any EBV antigens. The difference between the normal and HIV\u2212 lymphoma population and the HIV+/KS population lay not in the individual antigens recognized, but rather in the heightened antigenic response to a range of EBV proteins. This is illustrated by the increased median number of antigens detected at 1:10 000 plasma dilution seen with HIV+/KS samples (15) vs the median number with plasma from healthy donors and lymphoma patients (7 and 5, respectively). Antigens with a statistically significant difference in appearance between healthy donors and HIV+/KS patients at a 1:10 000 dilution are shown in Figure 3, which also includes the data for HIV-negative lymphoma patients for comparative purposes.

It is likely that these individuals are infected with only 1 of the 2 EBV subtypes. Note that 9/10 discordant sera had preferential recognition of type 1 EBNA2, which is consistent with the greater prevalence of type 1 EBV in clinical samples from the United States.

The average signal intensity for ORF73C was higher in the HIV-positive KS population than in the HIV-positive lymphoma population. There was also an indication of increased lytic KSHV replication in the KS patients. Sixty-six percent (10/15) of the HIV-positive KS plasma specimens had antibody responses to KSHV ORF38, a myristylated tegument protein, while 0/9 LANA-positive, HIV-positive lymphoma patients had titers to ORF38 at the 1:10,000 dilution. Similarly, 53% (8/15) of the HIV-positive KS serum had antibody responses to KSHV ORF36, the conserved protein kinase that is a homolog of HSV-1 UL13, while only 1/9 (11%) of LANA-positive HIV-positive lymphoma patients had titers to ORF36. The most commonly used antigen to test for antibodies to lytic KSHV infection is the envelope glycoprotein K8.1 [4, 31, 32]; 8/15 (53%) of HIV-positive KS sera recognized K8.1.",

There was no significant difference in either the intensity of the positive signals or the number of antigens being recognized at a 1:10 000 serum dilution. Thus, the presence of KSHV-associated disease did not appear to have any impact on humoral responses to EBV antigens in the setting of concurrent HIV-1 infection. Again, the broader antigenic response to EBV compared with KSHV is striking. The W1 exon of EBV BamHI-W encodes 22 amino acids that form part of the EBNA-LP protein [33, 34]. The protein encoded by the entire EBV BamHI-W ORF (BWRF1) and the EBNA-LP protein were both printed on the array. We noted that 23/24 (95%) of the specimens that recognized EBNA-LP also recognized the protein encoded by BWRF1, implying that the common 22 amino acids contribute significantly to antibody recognition of EBNA-LP.",

A consistent correlation between EBV or KSHV DNA levels in serum or plasma and antibody titers to viral proteins has not been apparent [37]. To see if the more global antibody responses detected on the arrays would provide any additional insight, we examined KSHV and EBV DNA levels in the plasma from HIV-positive KS patients (see Figure 2A). The plasma copy number for KSHV and EBV DNA was measured by real-time quantitative PCR using previously published primers [27]. A comparison of DNA copy number with antibody responses did not reveal any obvious correlation for either KSHV or EBV (Figure 5). However, the 2 samples with the highest KSHV DNA copy number (>180 000 copies) did not recognize either the K8.1 or ORF38 lytic proteins, whereas 61% (8/13) of the samples with <50 000 copies recognized both of these antigens. Two samples are insufficient to allow any conclusions to be drawn, but the observation does raise the possibility that inadequate antibody production may have contributed to the robust KSHV replication detected in these individuals.",

In addition to nasopharyngeal carcinoma, IgA responses to VCA and to EBNA1 are frequently elevated in lymphoma patients and in individuals who are HIV-1 positive [39]. IgA responses to EBV proteins were examined at a 1:1000 dilution for 15 of the HIV-positive KS patients, 10 healthy individuals, and 10 HIV-positive lymphoma patients. Seven EBV antigens were consistently recognized by IgA across these patient groups, namely, EBNA1, the helicase BBLF4, the viral IL10 BCRF1, the uracil DNA glycoslyase BKRF3, the early protein BRRF1, the tegument protein BRRF2 [40], and the latency membrane protein LMP2A (Figure 6). The most intense IgA response detected was to EBNA1, which appeared to be recognized even more readily by IgA than IgG. All 25 normal and HIV-positive KS plasma tested recognized EBNA1 at a 1:1000 dilution, whereas in 4 of these samples there was no recognition of EBNA-1 by IgG even at a 1:100 dilution. However, the IgA response to the functionally equivalent protein in KSHV, LANA, was very different. Of 14 HIV-positive KS plasma samples that had IgG responses to LANA at a 1:10 000 dilution, only 2 had IgA responses at a 1:1000 dilution (data not shown). In 1 previous study, IgA antibody to KSHV LANA was detected in saliva but not in serum [41].",

The EBV latency proteins EBNA1, EBNA2, and EBNA3C and the KSHV LANA latency and K8.1 lytic proteins have been widely used as antigens, and these antigens were also frequently detected on the arrays. Our protein array screens also identified the EBV tegument proteins BBRF2, BGLF2, and BNRF1 (FGARAT); the small capsid protein BFRF3; the early protein BRRF1; and the KSHV ORF38 tegument protein as lytic viral proteins that are particularly well recognized by IgG. The screens also identified BBLF4, BCRF1, BKRF3, and BBRF1 as EBV lytic proteins that were well recognized by IgA. It should be noted that the EBV and KSHV proteins for our array were expressed in yeast which do not have the same machinery as mammalian cells for complex glycosylation.

Multiple EBV proteins were consistently recognized by plasma IgG at the dilutions examined, whereas only the LANA (ORF73), ORF38, and K8.1 proteins of KSHV were detected with any consistency, even in patients with KS. This difference carried over to serum IgA responses where 2 latency EBV proteins and 5 lytic proteins were detected by the majority of the sera, while the only KSHV antigen detected by IgA was LANA, and that was seen only rarely. These observed differences may reflect the biology of in vivo persistence. Both viruses latently infect B cells, and both viruses are secreted into saliva [42, 43]. However, EBV can be routinely detected in circulating latently infected B cells of healthy seropositive individuals, whereas detection of KSHV in blood is rare [44\u201346]. The preferential ability to detect serum IgA responses against EBV vs KSHV on the protein arrays may also be related to in vivo infection of mucosal epithelial cells by EBV because the most frequently observed antigens were latency proteins or lytic replicative proteins known to be expressed in epithelial cells [47\u201350]. KSHV infects endothelial cells as well as B cells, but the contribution of endothelial cells to in vivo viral persistence is not well understood.",
