Hospital effluents are usually discharged into the urban sewer system, where they mix with other effluents before finally being treated in the sewage treatment plant (co-treatment). This practice is common in Australia, Iran, Egypt, India, Japan, South Africa, and Thailand. However, in many other developing countries, such as Algeria, Bangladesh, Congo, Ethiopia, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Taiwan, and Vietnam, hospital effluents can represent a major source of toxic elements in the aquatic environment since the effluents are discharged into drainage systems, rivers, and lakes without prior treatment. According to Ashfaq et al. [41], no hospital, irrespective of its size, has installed proper wastewater treatment facilities in Pakistan. In Taiwan, some hospitals discharge their wastewaters (legally or illegally) directly into nearby rivers with scarce treatment at all [44]. Of 70 governmental hospitals from different provinces of Iran, 48% were equipped with wastewater treatment systems, while 52% were not. Fifty-two percent of the hospitals without treatment plants disposed their raw wastewater into wells, 38% disposed it directly into the environment and the rest into the municipal wastewater network [35]. Comparison of the indicators between effluents of wastewater treatment systems and the standards of Environmental Departments shows the inefficiency of these systems and, despite recent improvements in hospital wastewater treatment systems, they should be upgraded.\n",

In the last few years a more complex investigation of antibiotics has been undertaken in different countries in order to assess their environmental risks. It has been found that the concentrations of antibiotics are higher in hospital effluents than in municipal wastewater, which has higher concentration levels than different surface waters, ground water, and sea water [53]. HWWs could be a source of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria which are excreted by patients. The HWWs either flow into a hospital sewage system or directly into a municipal wastewater sewer, before being subsequently treated in a WWTP. After treatment in a WWTP, the effluent is discharged into surface waters or is used for irrigation. Studies have shown that the release of wastewater from hospitals was associated with an increase in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance. A study conducted in Australia by Thompson et al. 2012 [27] revealed evidence of the survival of antibiotic resistant strains in untreated HWWs and their transit to the STP and then through to the final treated effluent. The strong influence of HWWs on the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli in Indian WWTPs has been revealed by Alam et al. [24] and Akiba et al. [33]. Untreated hospital and municipal wastewaters were found to be responsible for the dissemination of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria in the rivers of Pakistan [22].",

Analyses of the results obtained from South Africa indicated that HWWs may be one of the sources of antibiotic resistant bacteria in the receiving WWTP.

Hospital wastewaters are subjected to different treatment scenarios in the studied countries (specific treatment, co-treatment, and direct disposal into the environment). Due to the lack of municipal wastewater treatment plants, the onsite treatment of hospital wastewater before discharge into municipal sewers should be considered a viable option and consequently implemented. Where applicable, the discharge of HWWs into municipal wastewater collection systems is an alternative for wastewater management in hospitals. Upgrading existing WWTPs and improving operation and maintenance practices through the use of experienced operators are recommended measures.",
