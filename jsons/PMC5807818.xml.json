In total 51 studies were found. 10 articles were excluded because they either did not deal with sepsis or with aquaporins. One article was excluded because it was in Russian. The workflow of literature research can be found in Fig. 1. Due to the relative low number of articles dealing with real bacterial sepsis models, endotoxemia models using LPS injection were included in the analysis.\n",

It was demonstrated that in leucocytes of septic patients AQP3 expression is reduced 2.5 [8] fold and that simultaneously AQP1 expression is increased twofold [8]. In line with this our group showed that AQP1 expression is increased in the monocytic cell line THP-1 after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, but AQP5 mRNA expression is reduced [9]. AQP6 expression in contrast might play a role in viral infections as it is decreased after viral infection and in turn can reduce the infectivity of Hazara virus [10]. Furthermore, AQP8 is reduced in hepatocytes after LPS administration [11]. In addition, patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) show increased AQP9 expression in neutrophils compared to healthy controls [12]. Moreover, Gram-negative bacteria as P. aeruginosa induce increased expression, distribution and re-organization of AQP9 in macrophages with is accompanied by changes in macrophage size and morphology. This in turn affects motility, migration and phagocytosis [13].",

This causes membrane expansion and formation of a concentration gradient of actin polymers which is followed by actin repolymerization to stabilize the membrane protrusion and lamellipodia formation [17]. As immune cell migration is an essential mechanism in sepsis, AQPs might depict key players in this process. Considerable AQPs for immune cell migration are AQP1, AQP3, AQP5, AQP7 and AQP9 as they are expressed in activated B and T lymphocytes (AQP1, 3, 5) [15] as well as immature dendritic cells (AQP3, 5, 7) [15] and neutrophils (AQP9) [15, 18, 19] (Fig. 2f).\n",

Recently we showed that Aqp5-knockout (KO) mice show increased survival compared to wildtype mice after LPS induced endotoxemia. Furthermore, AQP5 overexpression caused increased migration of the T-lymphocytic cell line Jurkat. In addition, neutrophil granulocytes from C-allele carriers showed decreased migration compared to A-allele carriers. Therefore we concluded that the AQP5 genotype and AQP5 protein expression seem to alter neutrophil cell migration and may influence survival in sepsis by altering neutrophil cell migration. Hence AQP5 might be a key protein in inflammation and depict a novel target for developing sepsis therapeutics [21].",

They found that mouse resident peritoneal macrophages (mRPMs) express the aquaglyceroporin Aqp3 and to a low extent Aqp7 and Aqp9 in a plasma membrane pattern [22]. In contrast to our study, Aqp3-KO mice show significantly greater mortality than wildtype mice in a model of bacterial peritonitis. In addition, Aqp3-KO is accompanied by reduced migration of macrophages [22]. Besides to macrophage function, AQP3 seems also to be crucial for T-cell migration. It is suggested that AQP3-mediated H2O2 uptake is required for chemokine-dependent T-cell migration and a sufficient immune response [23].",

For example septic shock and its toxins can cause hypoxic hepatitis, cholestasis due to altered bile metabolism or hepatocellular and acute liver injury [46]. In cholestasis AQP8 might play a role as it is downregulated after LPS stimulation in hepatocytes via TNF-\u03b1 [11, 47]. The reduced AQP8 expression in turn causes reduced water permeability of hepatocytes, which can result in reduced bile formation and aggravates cholestasis [48, 49] (Fig. 2e). Beside, AQP8 can modulate hepatocellular mitochondria function by modifying water transport [50]. A loss of mitochondria function in turn can cause kidney injury due to loss of cellular energy [51]. In an endotoxemia rat model hepatic mitochondrial Aqp8 expression is reduced [52]. Regulation of Aqp8 in endotoxemia and septic models by substances like tetramethylpyrazine or ethyl pyruvate could stabilize the mitochondria membrane potential, protect hepatocellular mitochondria from damage and might therefore be a therapeutic option in sepsis [51, 53].",

In lung mainly the aquaporins AQP1 and 5, 8 and to a lower extent AQP9 are expressed [60]. Here, Aqp1 is expressed in all vascular endothelial cells, Aqp5 in the alveolar type I cells and Aqp8 and Aqp9 can be found in the bronchial epithelial cells in lung [61] (Fig. 2c). In 2016 in a small group of septic patients suffering from diffuse alveolar damage is was demonstrated that they have increased expression of AQP3 and AQP5 in the alveolar septum compared to healthy controls [62]. Recently it was demonstrated that Aqp5 expression is decreased after sepsis induction with cecal ligation puncture (CLP) in the lung of rats [63, 64]. This effect can be attenuated by emodin [65] and is regulated by the microRNAs miR-96 and miR-330 [66]. In line with this Aqp1 expression is decreased after LPS exposure in rat lungs [6, 67]. As a therapeutic option it was demonstrated that hydrogen rich saline and parenteral vitamin C can be protective in sepsis related lung injury and that it can attenuate the LPS induced reduction of Aqp1 and Aqp5 expression [5, 68]. In addition, Aqp1 and Aqp5 expression in lung is reduced in lung after an inflammatory pancreatitis models, whereas Aqp8 and Aqp9 expression remains unaffected [61]. Here the traditional Chinese prescription Dai-Huang-Fu-Zi-Tang can upregulate Aqp1 and 5 and attenuate inflammation [61].",
