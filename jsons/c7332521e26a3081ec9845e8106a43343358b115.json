Two pediatric pulmonologists enrolled all of the subjects, administered the questionnaire, and confirmed that those enrolled met all of the enrollment criteria. The children comprised three groups: (a) acute upper respiratory infection (URI, n \u00bc 74), the URI children had symptoms of sore throat and or pharyngeal erythema within 7 days prior to enrollment and were without signs of pneumonia or wheezing on physical examination; (b) upper respiratory infections and wheezing (URI-wheezing, n \u00bc 52) children with symptoms of URI and wheezing on presentation; and (c) healthy controls, who had no respiratory symptoms for 4 weeks prior to enrollment (n \u00bc 51). Controls were children who came to the clinic with their parent or guardian, accompanying another child who was seeking medical assistance. The control children did not have any immediate health complaints and had no symptoms of a respiratory illness during the last four weeks. The required number of subjects per group was estimated, based on the prevalence of sub-clinical vitamin A deficiency in this population and on predicted changes in the total respiratory resistance (TRR). The original estimate predicted that 65 cases and controls were required to achieve a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05. We ultimately enrolled 51 controls and 74 URI-without wheezing patients. After most of the patients in these groups had been enrolled, it became apparent that very few URI-without wheezing patients had a TRR > 150% predicted. Therefore a third group was enrolled, comprised of 52 children who had wheezing at initial presentation with a URI and whose TRR was significantly elevated. A questionnaire addressing respiratory health, history of atopy, 15 home environment was completed by the caregiver of the children. The subject and their accompanying caregiver were asked to report what the child had eaten for each meal during the prior 24 hr, and specifically questioned whether they consumed foodstuffs that contain retinol or carotenoids (milk, margarine, carrots, a particular squash available in Northeast Brazil, eggs, fruit juice, meat, and green leafy vegetables). 16 Anthropometric measurements were obtained and a complete physical examination was performed.

There was a significant positive correlation between albumin and RBP (P \u00bc 0.023, R \u00bc 0.331) in the URI-wheezing group, suggesting that these subjects had a decline in a second liver-derived protein, in addition to RBP. Therefore diminished synthesis may have contributed to the lower RBP in the URI-wheezing group. Others have shown that serum retinol may decline because of a short-term increase in renal clearance (even if the CRP remains <5 mg/L), without depletion of the larger retinyl ester storage pool in the liver. 25 The percentage saturation of transferrin with iron showed a trend towards being lower in the URI-wheezing group, although the iron content did not differ from the control and URI-groups. We used the MRDR so estimate hepatic vitamin A stores. The MRDR is most commonly expressed as a categorical variable, with 0.059 as an upper limit of normal. Those with a MRDR ! 0.06 are considered to be marginally vitamin A deficient, although their serum retinol is in the normal range. Others have sub-divided the normal range and correlated other variables with the sub-divisions; although they have lower predictive value for health consequences than the traditional cut-off of 0.059. 17, 26 The MRDR has some weaknesses as a surrogate of hepatic vitamin A stores, because like retinol the newly acquired serum 3,4 DHR is also bound to RBP, which may diminish during inflammation. 27 Using the isotope dilution technique may circumvent this weakness. 28 Prior comparisons of serum retinol in children with and without asthma have varied. Some have observed a correlation between low serum retinol and the severity of wheezing 29, 30 or history of asthma. 31, 32 Our observation of a low serum retinol during URI with wheezing in children with a prior history of asthma is consistent with most prior studies.

A less severe acute illness may account for the observation of a normal mean retinol. Fifty-eight percent of the children without wheezing had a MRDR > 0.06 during the URI, whereas this was observed in only one child with wheezing, and in none of the controls. As an assessment of liver stores, the MRDR is a time-average of vitamin A intake over months rather than weeks or days. Only two children in the URI-group and two in the URI-wheezing group had symptoms for more than 7 days, making it unlikely that liver stores diminished during the acute illness. Therefore, estimated liver stores in URI-children were chronically lower than in the URI-wheezing and control groups. Because this was unanticipated, we evaluated several potential explanations. No children were supplemented with vitamin A during the 6 months prior to enrollment, and 29.4% and 16.0% of children in the control and URI-groups, respectively, had received vitamin A between 6 and 12 months prior to enrollment. Differences in diet, not discerned by the 24-hr recall may have contributed. Most of the children in the URI-and URI-wheezing groups were enrolled during the rainy season (April through August). However the peak enrollment for the control group was during January through March. Seasonal vitamin A-rich fruits and vegetables may have been more readily available during October through January, just prior to enrollment of the majority of the control children. We also assessed the correlation between the MRDR and absolute blood eosinophil count. A larger fraction of the children in the URI group had eosinophils at the high end of the range compared to the other two groups (see E- Figure  1 ). This suggests that intestinal helminthes may have been more prevalent in children of the URI group. Intestinal helminthes deplete hepatic vitamin A stores, resulting in increased MRDR which can be normalized by deworming. 34, 35 Others have used forced oscillation (FOS) to estimate TRR in children. Delacourt and associates evaluated respiratory mechanics in asthmatic children and found that FOS correlated with spirometry. 36 Because FOS does not require a maximal expiratory effort, it was more suitable in children between 3 and 7 years of age, when VAD is most common. Similar to others, we observed a coefficient of variation (CV) for the combined R5Hz (TRR) measurements in all subjects of 9%. 37 The mean change in TRR between the first and second encounter was 34% for the URI-wheezing and 19% for the URI groups respectively, which is greater than the CV of the within the same day measurements.

In the URI-group, children with the most elevated MRDR had the smallest decline in TRR during convalescence (Table 6 ). However, within the URIwheezing group, the convalescent decline in TRR was not less in those children with lower serum retinol. The lower retinol in the URI-wheezing group may result from an inflammatory response. Children in the URIwheezing group with the highest MRDR did not show a diminished normalization of TRR after recovery from their URI symptoms. Two factors may contribute to this variance from the group of children with URI but without wheezing. First, there was only one child in the URI-wheezing cohort whose MRDR exceeded 0.06.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 430, "end": 438, "text": "(Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "And second, the convalescent incremental decrease in TRR was much greater in the URI-wheezing group. This suggests that in this group, in which nearly all children had a prior history of asthma, other contributors to airway inflammation and wheezing, may have obscured a more subtle effect of vitamin A. An alternate interpretation of our findings is that the lower mean MRDR (and presumably more abundant vitamin A reserves) in the URI-wheezing compared to the URI group predisposes the children to wheezing, as others observed in mice, which were sensitized to ovalbumin. 14 Although airway eosinophils increase in asthmatics during a URI, neutrophils and Th1 T-cells also increase, which differs from the ovalbumin model in mice where changes are almost exclusively observed in airway eosinophils. 38, 39 The mechanisms behind this association between reduced vitamin A and delayed normalization of TRR remain undefined. This case-control study yielded correlative data, and cannot conclusively define mechanisms. However our findings may be interpreted in light of recent findings about how retinoids influence the airway immune response. Allergic, Th2-driven inflammation is a hallmark of asthma and bronchial hyperreactivity. Studies in mice suggest that retinoic acid (RA, an important biologically active vitamin A-metabolite) establishes and maintains forkhead box (Fox)P3\u00fe regulatory T-cells (Treg). 40 Along with transforming growth factor b and rapamycin, RA can reprogram Th2 cells into FoxP3\u00fe Tregs, and reduce airway inflammation. A recent study of Ecuadorian children showed that circulating FoxP3\u00fe Tregs diminish prior to age 5 years as differentiated CD4 and CD8 T-cells increase. 41 Poor vitamin A nutriture during the first 5 years of life may enhance the loss of Tregs and afford reduced protection against airway reactivity.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 801, "end": 804, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 805, "end": 807, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1410, "end": 1412, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 1699, "end": 1701, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "It is unclear whether the lack of decrease in TRR in children with MRDR > 0.06 has physiological or symptomatic consequences.
