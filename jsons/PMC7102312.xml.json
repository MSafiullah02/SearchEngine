            "text": "Patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) are at high risk for respiratory viral infections, such as influenza A, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). In spring 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza A virus caused a pandemic [1]. Following the pandemic, the seroprevalence of H1N1 antibodies was 36.9% in healthy people who had not received vaccination, with almost 70% of H1N1 (2009) infections being inapparent in healthy people [2]. Pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza A infections may lead to severe pneumonia in children and young adults, with immunosuppression being an important risk factor [3\u20135]. Due to the profound immunodeficiency in patients after alloHSCT, pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza A infection causes more severe respiratory disease in HSCT recipients than seasonal influenza A and B viruses, with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) being an additional risk factor [6\u201310]. Therefore, prevention and prophylaxis of infections, including re-vaccination, are crucial in this patient group [11].",

Blood samples for assessment of the vaccine response against H1N1 were obtained during regular visits at the outpatient clinic of the department of hematology and oncology at the University Hospital of Regensburg. The H1N1 vaccination was given either when the patient visited the outpatient department of the University Hospital or by a general practitioner. Twenty-two patients received only one dose of pandemic H1N1 vaccine, and 14 patients (39%) were vaccinated twice. Three patients had proven pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza infection, one of whom had been vaccinated once previously against pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus. Medical records were reviewed, and relevant data at the time of vaccination were recorded, including gender, patient age, date of alloHSCT, date of pandemic H1N1 (2009) vaccination, time after transplantation, underlying disease, current remission status, donor type, HLA-match, stem cell source, and the conditioning regimen.",

One patient was vaccinated twice: his titer after the first vaccination was 1:160 and after the second vaccination 1:1280. We therefore assumed a vaccination response because of the clear increase in titer after the second vaccination and due to the fact that the maximal baseline titer in all of the other patients prior to first vaccination was 1:40 and no other influenza vaccination was performed. The third patient showed a titer of 1:960, which was clearly positive and most likely not explained by a pre-existing titer. Therefore, this patient was regarded as a vaccination responder.

Two patients had pandemic H1N1 (2009) infection without prior vaccination, and one patient developed severe pandemic H1N1 (2009) infection with ARDS despite a prior single pandemic H1N1 (2009) vaccination.

However, it can not be excluded that some of the patients failing to respond to the first vaccination, but who did not receive a second vaccination, would have achieved seroprotection in response to the latter. Similar results have been described by other groups [20]. In 2005, Ljungman et al. [26] found that compared to one dose of vaccine, two doses did not improve the vaccination response to influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and influenza B in 70 patients with hematological malignancies. One dose of seasonal influenza A/H1N1 vaccine is highly immunogenic in adults, while two doses will probably be needed in children younger than 9 years [21].

Prior rituximab therapy completely abrogated subsequent vaccination response in our cohort, which is in line with other results reported elsewhere [13, 22, 28, 29]. Moreover, a patient receiving rituximab as the sole immunosuppressive treatment 8 months before being vaccinated against pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus developed life-threatening pandemic H1N1 (2009) infection despite vaccination, indicating a long-lasting effect of rituximab. As observed in our cohort, the use of monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, has been associated with severe courses of influenza [6\u20138]. The effect of rituximab is in line with the association of low na\u00efve and memory B cell counts with failure to respond to vaccination. B cells begin to recover at the very earliest 6 months after treatment, and they do not return to pretreatment levels for up to 1 year [30]. A very poor response to seasonal influenza vaccination in patients treated with monoclonal antibodies (rituximab or alemtuzumab) for lymphoma has been described by Ljungman et al. [26] and confirmed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [31]. Whether recall antigens can generate an appreciable response to influenza vaccination in patients after rituximab therapy, as described by Takata et al., was not examined in our cohort [29].",

The role of B cells is underlined by the impact of the immunoglobulin serum level on the vaccination response.
