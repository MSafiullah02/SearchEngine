These micro-droplets containing the virus can infect a healthy human by settling on the face (mouth, nose, ears, eyes) or hands11. This virus can sustain for a long time on various surfaces which is also considered as a significant reason for its transmission. Frequent touching of the facial area, handshake and unavoidable touch to different surfaces while travelling (through various transport means) is also a significant threat to humans. Also, the transmission is known as \"hidden transmission\" by the carrier unknowingly spreading the infection to other population exists12.",

They have used a Bayesian regression model to study the decay rate of the virus on different surfaces. Around ten experiments with different conditions involving the above two viruses were done for five different environmental conditions. These include four metal surfaces and aerosol. Plastic, Stainless Steel, Copper, and Cardboard were the four metal surfaces taken to consideration. The reason behind to take theses metal surfaces was the use of these materials in our day to day life, whether the population is travelling, shopping or doing work in the office. Study on the aerosol showed that SARS-CoV-2 could sustain it for up to three hours. One important observation was that during the time the virus reduces its infecting capability, from 103.5 to 102.7 Tissue Culture Infective Dose (TCID) 50 per litre of air. A similar tendency of SARS-CoV-1 is also observed in this study and identified that the infection capability of COVID-19 virus has reduced from 104.3 to 103.5 TCID50 per millilitre26. Table 2\ngives a comparative study of both viruses and shows that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 have significant sustaining time on different surfaces.",

We see a linear decrease in the infection capability of this virus, with respect to time, and the same varies according to the medium (surface). This linear decrease shows the exponential decay in virus titre in per litre of air or millilitre of medium with time. The green line shows the linear decay of infection capability in the graphs. Graphs for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 are confined from 1 to 5 digits; theses digits depict the five environmental conditions viz. 1-Aerosol, 2-Plastic, 3-Stainless Steel, 4- Copper and 5-Cardboard.",

The alcohol-based disinfectants can significantly reduce the survival and decay time of the virus. The two important Coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1) have significant sustaining time on different metal surfaces, and their behaviour is almost similar on various metal surfaces and in aerosols.",
