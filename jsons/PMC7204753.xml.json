Hong-Jie reported that lithium inhibited in vitro the entry and replication of the porcine epidemic diarrhea (PEDV) coronavirus in Vero cells [1]. The expresi\u00f3n of viral RNA and protein of PEDV in Vero cells was suprpressed in a dose-dependent manner by lithium. Moreover lithium inhibited early and late apoptosis induced by PEDV. Sally M Harrison reported the efectiveness of lithium inhibiting in two model of cell types, the coronavirus bronchitis virus [2], and these findings were refrended by Jing Li et al [3].",
