            "text": "Zika virus (ZIKV) was first isolated in 1947 from a febrile rhesus macaque in the Zika Forest of Uganda (Dick et al., 1952). Since then, sporadic ZIKV infections occurred in Africa and Asia (Haddow et al., 2012, Hayes, 2009). Until 2015, ZIKV infection usually has been associated with mild symptoms and thus, the virus had not been considered a threatening pathogen. However, since the recent outbreaks it is evident that ZIKV causes drastic birth defects, most prominently microcephaly (Mlakar et al., 2016, Rasmussen et al., 2016), and is associated with neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016, Krauer et al., 2017). Since 2007, 84 countries and territories reported ongoing ZIKV transmission (http://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/en/). In Brazil alone, 1.3 million persons had been infected (Shuaib et al., 2016), prompting the WHO to declare ZIKV a public health emergency of international concern. Currently, there are no specific treatments or vaccines against ZIKV making development of effective preventive measures an urgent public health need (Barrows et al., 2016, Paix\u00e3o et al., 2016). ZIKV is transmitted mainly via mosquito bites but cases of sexual transmission also have been reported (D'Ortenzio et al., 2016, Moreira et al., 2017, Petersen et al., 2016). Like other members of the Flaviviridae family (e.g. Dengue virus), Zika virions are surrounded by a host-membrane-derived lipid bilayer containing envelope glycoproteins responsible for cell entry (Sirohi et al., 2016).",

Since then, outbreaks sporadically occurred in Africa, with the most severe in 2014, reaching epidemic proportions and a death toll of more than 11,000 people (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2016). EBOV belongs to the family of Filoviridae, forms enveloped filamentous infectious particles, and causes hemorrhagic fever, a rare and deadly disease with a high fatality rate. In addition to being a global health concern, the virus also is considered a potential biological threat agent. EBOV likely is transmitted from infected bats to humans where it may spread through personal contact, contaminated objects, or sexual intercourse (Mate et al., 2015, Pandey et al., 2014). Noteworthy, even after recovery, EBOV is found in some body fluids, including semen, up to several months (Deen et al., 2017). As for now, no licensed vaccine or medicine is available to prevent or manage future EBOV outbreaks (Sharma and Ketki Jangid, 2017).",

            "text": "Molecular tweezers are novel drug candidates for the treatment of amyloidosis and related conditions. A lead compound, CLR01, has been used in many in vitro and in vivo studies to date (Attar et al., 2014, Schrader et al., 2016). Binding of CLR01 to lysine residues in polypeptides disrupts noncovalent molecular interactions that are important for the abnormal self-assembly that leads to the formation of toxic oligomers and amyloid aggregates (Schrader et al., 2016, Sinha et al., 2011). In fact, CLR01 prevents assembly and promotes disaggregation of amyloid fibrils that are associated with neurodegenerative diseases (Attar et al., 2012, Ferreira et al., 2014, Prabhudesai et al., 2012, Richter et al., 2017). Therapeutic effects of CLR01 have been demonstrated in animal models of Parkinson's disease (Lulla, 2016, Prabhudesai et al., 2012, Richter et al., 2017), Alzheimer's disease (Attar et al., 2012, Malik et al., 2017), Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy (FAP) (Ferreira et al., 2014), and desmin-related cardiomyopathy (Xu et al., 2017) and was found to be safe in mice at doses 250-times higher than those showing therapeutic effects (Attar et al., 2014). We have recently established that CLR01 also disrupted the formation of amyloid fibrils in semen (Lump et al., 2015), which enhance HIV-1 infection (M\u00fcnch et al., 2007, Usmani et al., 2014). Surprisingly, CLR01 also inhibited HIV-1 infection through a direct virus-inactivating mechanism: the tweezer preferentially bound to raft-rich regions in the viral membrane resulting in the disruption of the lipid bilayer and loss of infectivity. In line with the membrane targeting activity, CLR01 is inactive against non-enveloped viruses such as human adenovirus but destroyed other enveloped viruses, including hepatitis-C virus, human cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus, demonstrating that CLR01 represents a broadly active antiviral compound with prospects for microbicide or drug development (Lump et al., 2015). Thus, we evaluated here whether CLR01 might also block infection of re-emerging enveloped viruses. We show that CLR01 indeed inhibits infection of replication-competent EBOV and ZIKV as well as Marburg, Rabies, and SARS Corona virus (SARS-CoV) pseudoparticles. CLR01 lost antiviral activity in the presence of serum, but remained active in the presence of semen, urine, saliva or cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, this broadly active compound represents a promising lead for further development as a microbicide to protect from the sexual acquisition of ZIKV or EBOV, or as a topically applied drug for the therapy of viral infections of the skin, mucosa or the respiratory tract.",

To test this hypothesis, we generated luciferase-encoding retroviral particles harboring glycoproteins derived from EBOV, the closely related Filovirus Marburg virus, Rabies virus (Rhabdoviridae) or SARS-CoV (Coronaviridae). These pseudoparticles were exposed to CLR01 and then added to Huh-7 cells. CLR03, which lacks hydrophobic side arms and has no anti-HIV-1 activity (Lump et al., 2015), served as a negative control. Infection rates were determined three days later by quantifying luciferase activity and showed that CLR01, in contrast to CLR03, efficiently blocked infection by all tested pseudoparticles (Fig. 1\nA). The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of CLR01 against the four pseudoparticles were similar and ranged between 27.6 \u03bcM for Rabies and 45.6 \u03bcM for Marburg virus (Fig. 1A). These data corroborate our previous findings that CLR01 targets the viral membrane rather than a viral glycoprotein (Lump et al., 2015). We tested next whether CLR01 blocked infection by the replication-competent BSL4 pathogen EBOV. Vero E6 cells were inoculated with GFP-encoding EBOV (Ebihara et al., 2007, Hoenen et al., 2013) that had been exposed to CLR01 or CLR03. After 7 days, the number of virus-induced plaques revealed that CLR01, but not CLR03, reduced the infectious titer in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 25.8 \u03bcM (Fig. 1B).",

In the absence of CLR01, ZIKV caused a profound cytopathic effect (CPE) as evidenced by large plaques caused by detachment of cells. CLR03 had no effect on this phenotype (Fig. 2\nA). However, exposure to 150 \u03bcM CLR01 prevented formation of the virus-induced CPE entirely. To quantitatively assess the antiviral activity, we used a colorimetric MTT assay measuring the virally induced CPE (M\u00fcller et al., 2016). In the absence of compounds or in the presence of CLR03, ZIKV resulted in more than 70% dead (detached) cells. In contrast, CLR01 suppressed CPE formation with an IC50 of 8.2 \u03bcM (Fig. 2B).",

To evaluate the effect of CLR01 on ZIKV more directly, infected cells were stained for the viral E protein and analyzed by confocal microscopy (Schandock et al., 2017). Upon treatment with 15 or 150 \u03bcM of CLR01, E protein-specific fluorescence could not be detected, whereas CLR03 had no effect, as expected (Fig. 2C). Lack of E protein expression in cells infected with CLR01-treated virus was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2D, Supplementary Fig. S1A). Of note, CLR01 was not cytotoxic at concentrations active against ZIKV (Supplementary Fig. S1B), and did not cause alterations in cell morphology (compare confocal images and dot plots of uninfected cells vs. 150 \u03bcM CLR01 exposed cells in Fig. 2C and D). Thus, CLR01 prevents ZIKV infection of Vero E6 cells.",

            "text": "We hypothesized that if CLR01 inhibited ZIKV infection by a similar mechanism to other enveloped viruses, its activity would be directed against the viral membrane (Lump et al., 2015). Indeed, when CLR01 was added to cells, rather than to the virus, and washed out prior to infection, no antiviral effect was observed in a cell-based ZIKV immunodetection assay (Fig. 3\nA). We performed next a time-course analysis in which ZIKV was exposed to 10 \u03bcM CLR01 for 10 to 3600 s prior to infection. Already after exposure for only 10 s, CLR01 reduced infection by \u223c43%. Infection declined further with increasing incubation time and was nearly at the level of uninfected cells after 1800 s incubation (Fig. 3B). In agreement with a direct activity against the virion, the IC50 of CLR01 increased from 4.3 \u03bcM to 32.3 \u03bcM when a 10-fold higher multiplicity of infection was applied (Supplementary Fig. S2). CLR01 was shown to destroy HIV-1 membrane integrity through interaction with raft-rich regions in the retroviral envelope (Lump et al., 2015). In contrast to HIV-1, the ZIKV particle is relatively densely packed with glycoproteins (Sirohi et al., 2016), which might hamper the interaction of the tweezer with the ZIKV membrane. To determine whether CLR01 might inhibit ZIKV infection through direct interaction with glycoproteins, increasing amounts of recombinant viral E protein were titrated to CLR01, and then these solutions were assayed for anti-ZIKV activity. As shown in Fig. 3C, even E-antigen concentrations of 1000 \u03bcg/ml did not affect the antiviral activity of CLR01, suggesting that the tweezer did not reduce ZIKV infectivity through binding to the viral E protein. Interestingly, we also observed that elevated E-antigen concentrations of 333 and 1000 \u03bcg/ml reduced infection in the absence of CLR01 (Fig. 3C), which is likely due to the competition between the virion-associated E protein and the recombinant E protein for cellular receptors.",

We characterized here mainly the effect of CLR01 on ZIKV, as there is currently no specific antiviral therapy nor a preventive vaccine available. CLR01 blocked ZIKV infection of primary brain-derived murine cells (Fig. 6B) as well as human cell lines derived from the anogenital region (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S4) and the brain (Fig. 6A) with IC50 values between 5 and 50 \u03bcM. These values are in the same range as IC50 values obtained against EBOV (26 \u03bcM, Fig. 1B) and HIV-1 (14-20 \u03bcM) (Lump et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Several lines of evidence demonstrate that the antiviral activity of CLR01 is directed against the ZIKV particle itself. First, treatment of cells with CLR01 prior to infection had no antiviral effect (Fig. 3A). Second, the IC50 of CLR01 increased with increasing viral concentrations (Supplementary Fig. S2). Third, the integrity of the ZIKV particle was lost upon CLR01 treatment, as shown by the release of viral RNA from CLR01-treated virions (Fig. 3D). These findings were in agreement with our previous observations that CLR01 selectively disrupted viral membranes (Lump et al., 2015). Interestingly, the selectivity stems from CLR01's preferential interaction with membranes containing high levels of sphingomyelin and cholesterol, two lipids that are enriched in membranes of enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1 or EBOV (Bavari et al., 2002, Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006, Chazal and Gerlier, 2003, Lorizate et al., 2013). The selective interaction of CLR01 with lipids that are enriched in the viral but not the cellular membrane may also explain its minimal effects on cell viability (Attar et al., 2012, Attar et al., 2014, Ferreira et al., 2014, Lopes et al., 2015, Prabhudesai et al., 2012, Sinha et al., 2011) (Fig. 2C, D, Supplementary Fig. S1B). CLR01 is slightly cytotoxic at concentrations of \u223c1 mM, corresponding to selectivity indices of 50\u2013100, which is in a reasonable range for drug development (Buschmann and Mannhold, 2017, Food and Drug Administration, 2006).",

This finding was unexpected because CLR01 has been found previously to be stable in mouse and human plasma, with a half-life of \u223c2.5 h in mice after SC or IV injection (Attar et al., 2014). Moreover, CLR01 showed therapeutic effects in animal models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (Attar et al., 2012, Malik et al., 2017, Prabhudesai et al., 2012, Richter et al., 2017). These data suggest that the loss of antiviral activity in the presence of serum likely was due to binding of CLR01 to serum proteins. The concentrations of CLR01 required to prevent amyloid formation in vitro and in vivo are in the sub-micromolar range, which is 2\u20133 orders of magnitude lower than those needed to block viral infection. Presumably, the vast majority of CLR01 was bound to serum proteins and hence unavailable to act on the virus, whereas the minority of the tweezer remains free at concentrations allowing to exert anti-amyloid activity. This interpretation also is supported by the observation that CLR01 retained anti-ZIKV activity in semen, urine, saliva, and CSF. The total protein concentrations in these body fluids are \u223c 1\u20133 orders of magnitude lower than in serum (Hu et al., 2006, Vibhakar et al., 2013). Thus, a larger percentage of CLR01 molecules likely are free in these biofluids and hence antivirally active.",

            "text": "CLR01 has been described previously as a novel bi-functional microbicide counteracting sexual HIV-1 transmission both through directly targeting virus infectivity and by inhibiting the infection-promoting activity of amyloids in semen (Lump et al., 2015). We show here that the tweezer also inhibits pathogenic ZIKV infection of cells derived from the anogenital region in the presence of semen. Interestingly, both ZIKV and EBOV are present in semen of infected individuals (Atkinson et al., 2016, Deen et al., 2017, Moreira et al., 2017) and can be transmitted by sexual intercourse, similar to HIV-1 (D'Ortenzio et al., 2016, Mate et al., 2015, Moreira et al., 2017). Thus, application of CLR01 as a microbicide in the vaginal or rectal tracts might protect from acquiring different viral pathogens. Interestingly, CLR01 has been shown to penetrate the BBB (Attar et al., 2012, Attar et al., 2014, Richter et al., 2017), where it may also block replication of neurotropic viruses such as Zika or Rabies (Cao-Lormeau et al., 2016, Ludlow et al., 2016, Mlakar et al., 2016). However, it needs to be considered that CLR01 may only block cell-free virus infection but not cell-to-cell viral spread, which may limit its utility as therapeutic agent. Therefore, the effect of CLR01 on cell-to-cell viral transmission needs to be explored. Another means of application of CLR01 is topical, e.g., by directly administering CLR01 on virus-infected body surfaces, such as the skin or mucous membranes, to treat, e.g., HSV-induced Herpes labialis or genitalis. Topical medications may also be inhalational, such as medications against Flu or Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), or applied to the surface of tissues other than the skin, such as eye drops applied to the conjunctiva, for example, in CMV-induced retinitis.",

            "text": "To address the challenge of emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens, it is imperative to develop broad-spectrum classes of antiviral agents as the conventional one-bug-one-drug paradigm is insufficient (Zhu et al., 2015). Current direct-acting antiviral drugs are highly successful but have a narrow spectrum of coverage and are only available against a very limited number of viral pathogens. Moreover, drug development is slow and expensive, and it typically takes more than a decade to get market approval. Currently, no specific antiviral treatment exists against most, if not all, emerging and re-emerging viruses. Broad-spectrum antivirals may offer certain advantages as they reduce time and cost of drug development, allow off-label use, and could be applied even before a viral threat is diagnosed (Bekerman and Einav, 2015, Zhu et al., 2015). CLR01 is broadly active against enveloped viruses as it disrupts lipid bilayers containing elevated levels of sphingomyelin and cholesterol (Lump et al., 2015), which are typically enriched in viral membranes (Bavari et al., 2002, Br\u00fcgger et al., 2006, Chan et al., 2008, Chazal and Gerlier, 2003, Lorizate et al., 2013). We have shown that CLR01 inactivates major viral pathogens such as HIV-1, HSV-2, CMV, and HCV, as well as ZIKV and EBOV. It is highly likely that CLR01 also blocks other enveloped viruses, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) Corona Viruses, Influenza or RSV. Most notably, resistance development against CLR01 is very unlikely to occur, as this would require changes in the lipid composition of the cellular and the viral membrane, which is difficult to envisage. In conclusion, CLR01 represents a promising prototype of a broad-spectrum antiviral agent.",
