The objective of this drug\u2010design approach was to merge these two moieties to enhance their activity against cancer cells. Our previous studies with this class of compounds showed that electronic character of the benzodithiazine ring system substituent at position\u20103 was an important factor influencing cytotoxicity 15. However, in this previous publication we reported that the compounds were quinazolinone derivates. Based on X\u2010ray crystal structure analysis of two representative compounds we now correct the structures to be benzoxazine derivatives. Herein, the effects of further structural modifications on antitumor activity were explored within two structural domains: The benzodithiazine ring (substituent R2) and substituents of benzoxazine moiety (R1\u2010phenyl). A correlation between the structures of these derivatives and the potency to inhibit the growth of cancer cells was investigated by using quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) methods.",
