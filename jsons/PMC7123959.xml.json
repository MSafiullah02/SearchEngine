It also is relatively easy to perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing on cultured isolates, so conventional culture methods with biochemical phenotyping remain the most common procedures performed in clinical microbiology laboratories [1]. To further assist in microbial identification, nucleic acid amplification has been introduced in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Such testing was initially done for viruses, allowing detection of small amounts of viral nucleic acid quickly. Similar tests also have been applied to bacteria, especially those that are difficult to grow on routine culture media, or are slow-growing such as Chlamydia, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Mycobacterium. In addition, there are ongoing efforts to integrate these new techniques into routine clinical microbiology testing, including the diagnosis of sepsis [1].",

It is a crucial preanalytic step in the development and performance of any successful molecular diagnostic method and ensures a reliable and clinically relevant result [3, 4]. We must pay close attention to the technical progress of the nucleic acid extraction as well as to the method for amplification and detection of nucleic acids in order to obtain satisfactory results. Nucleic acid extraction consists of three major processes: isolation, purification, and concentration. Commercial extraction kits are commonly used in the clinical microbiology laboratory [2]. These kits provide the essential requirements for nucleic acid extraction. These essential requirements have been well described by Boom et al. [6, 7] as follows: (1) extraction should be simple and rapid and should show high sensitivity and specificity; (2) it is preferred that there be no requirements for specialized equipment or special knowledge and skills; (3) the final nucleic acid should be pure and easy to modify for various amplification techniques; (4) the reagents and their product should be harmless; and (5) the process of preparation should resist contamination with other specimens. If the final volume of eluate is small, detection limits are maximized. When we deal with clinical specimens, we also should consider the elimination of potential inhibitors of the DNA polymerase and the removal of pathogenicity from hazardous pathogens as well as good target recovery and establishment of the integrity of nucleic acid targets [2]. Ideally, the final target is pure nucleic acid without amplification inhibitors or contaminants such as proteins, carbohydrates, and other nucleic acids [8].",

In terms of nucleic acid extraction, the same nucleic acid may be targeted, but there are different implications for the extraction procedure itself. Nucleic acid extraction from cultured bacteria is relatively simple because the isolated microbes are pure colonies that contain large numbers of organisms. However, it is important to recognize that gram-positive bacteria have thick cell walls, which makes nucleic acid extraction more difficult than it is with gram-negative bacteria, which have thinner cell walls [5]. For clinical specimens, the details of the extraction method depend on the characteristics of each specimen. It is important to remember that the goal of extraction is nucleic acid, not of humans, but of bacteria, virus, or fungus. If DNA or RNA is extracted from clinical specimens containing human cells, these extracted specimens will contain human DNA; the recovery of microbial DNA thus may be diminished by the presence of human DNA.",

The basic principle of this method is utilization of the difference in density between the cesium ion and water with intercalation of EtBr; this results in good separation of various DNAs and allows the procurement of high-yield DNA [11]. For example, each DNA can be separated as independent bands because of the differences in each DNA\u2019s density in the gradient caused by the intercalation of EtBr [7]. However, there are important limitations for this method in that it requires an expensive ultracentrifuge, is labor-intensive and difficult to perform, and requires more time and EtBr is harmful [7, 8]. Consequently, this method is not suitable for use in the clinical microbiology laboratory and thus has not been used in this setting.",

            "text": "Phenol-chloroform extraction is another method that has been widely used. The process consists of the vigorous mixing of a phenol-chloroform solution with the sample followed by centrifugation [7]. Phenol does not completely inhibit RNase activity, and this characteristic allows isolation of nucleic acid that has \u201cdissolved\u201d in the chloroform and phenol mixture [12]. After centrifugation, the upper (aqueous) phase containing the DNA can be separated from the lower (organic) phase containing denatured proteins, and DNA can be precipitated by adding ethanol or isopropanol with a high concentration of salt [8]. After washing with 70% ethanol to remove any remaining ethanol or isopropanol, the final target DNA is collected by dissolving it in TE buffer or sterile distilled water [13]. This method is also used for RNA extraction by concomitant use of guanidinium isothiocyanate. This combination can overcome the limitation of RNA extraction using the guanidinium isothiocyanate itself, so RNA could be isolated conveniently using a single-step technique by Chomczynski et al. [12, 14] Total RNA is recovered by precipitation with isopropanol after separation of the upper phase containing the total RNA from the lower phase containing DNA and proteins [12, 14]. Although the phenol-chloroform method is relatively easy compared with the CsCl/EtBr gradient and is very useful for the extraction of nucleic acids, it also is problematic for the clinical microbiology laboratory because phenol has important limitations due to its being toxic, caustic, and flammable [5, 15, 16].",

            "text": "McCormick et al. introduced a new DNA extraction method involving solid-phase extraction in 1989 [17]. They used an insoluble siliceous core particle rather than liquid phenol. The function of this siliceous core particle is similar to that of phenol, but it has several major advantages in that it is safer, and cross contamination can be reduced. It is well known that the precipitation in the phenol/chloroform method causes DNA loss, and Meijer et al. demonstrated that this DNA loss could be reduced by replacing the precipitating step with silica particles [18]. Solid-phase nucleic acid extraction was incorporated into many commercial kits, and it still is the basis of many extraction methods, although siliceous core particles have been replaced by other materials such as silica matrices, glass particles, diatomaceous earth, and anion-exchange carriers (Table 1, Fig. 1) [7]. Solid-phase extraction uses a spin column operated by centrifugal force allowing DNA to be purified rapidly and efficiently without the limitations of liquid extraction, including incomplete phase separation [8]. Solid-phase extraction using silica now is one of most common methods for nucleic acid extraction. Silica that possesses a positive charge combines strongly with DNA, which possesses a negative charge, so it can enable rapid, pure, and quantitative purification [7]. In 1990, Boom et al. [6] used an innovative approach in which diatomaceous earth served as a matrix for solid-phase extraction. The principle of this method is that it immobilizes DNA onto its particles in the presence of a chaotropic agent. The technique can purify rRNA as well as single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. It takes only a short time and can be applied to clinical specimens as well as to DNA and bacteria. The process of solid-phase extraction involves cell lysis, nucleic acid adsorption, washing, and elution [7, 8]. Column conditioning is obtained using a buffer at a particular pH [20]. The nucleic acid will be released after cell lysis and decanting of lysis buffer into the column. Nucleic acid adsorption is completed in a chaotropic salt solution [20]. Washing buffer contains a competitive agent and can remove contaminants such as proteins and salts. In elution, TE buffer is applied to the column so that purified nucleic acid will be released [20].",

The beads have a negative surface charge and bind proteins and cellular debris selectively [7]. So, DNA can be isolated easily from specimens by removing proteins and cellular debris on the beads. This has the potential advantages of removing the need for repeated centrifugation, vacuum filtration, and column separation for washing and elution as well as organic solvents [7, 8]. The magnetic bead method is very simple and convenient; so many commercially available kits are used for this method [8]. Some manufacturers combined the techniques of solid-phase extraction with the use of silica and magnetic beads, which satisfies the customers\u2019 requests for time- and labor-effectiveness and efficiency (Fig. 2). This method is commonly used in automated extraction methods such as miniMag (bioMerieux) and MagNA Pure (Roche). In terms of new technology, additional commercially available kits using this new technique are being introduced into the market. The enzymatic method is an example of these new extraction methods [21]. These new methods help investigators by providing the advantages of convenience with the requirement for only small volumes of specimen while enhancing DNA recovery.",

So, a more complex step to extract the nucleic acid of the microbial pathogen is needed. Most commercial kits for tissue specimens extract human nucleic acid also. In recent years, it has become possible to extract viral nucleic acid from clinical specimens having cellular components, and there have been trials of these commercially available kits to detect various clinically important viruses [30\u201332]. There is one report concerning the extraction of six viruses from clinical cellular specimens, and the investigators compared four commercial extraction methods [29]. The viruses included in this study are BK virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human herpesvirus 8, herpes simplex virus, and varicella-zoster virus.

So, stool specimens are considered one of most difficult specimens for nucleic acid extraction in the clinical laboratory. In one report by Peiris et al. [33], the positive rate was 97% for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in stool samples. However, the detection rates were quite different in another report: only 26.2% and 68.0% between 1 and 2 weeks after disease onset [34]. It is suggested that the difference in positive rates is a consequence of variations in the RNA extraction method [35].",

Many researchers have found that there are numerous PCR inhibitors in blood culture bottles such as sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) and hemins [36]. Millar and collaborators compared several commercial and in-house extraction methods used to detect bacteria and fungi in BacT/Alert blood culture bottles [37]. To reduce the detection time, the serum, plasma, or whole blood is used as a main specimen for detection of bacteria and fungi. Serum or plasma is more efficient and convenient than whole blood because whole blood includes many PCR inhibitors [38]. Most commercial kits showed a high recovery rate of pathogen DNA, but only those methods that used heat lysis with an alkali wash could remove PCR inhibitors. Detection of brucellosis was highly sensitive even though Brucella are facultative intracellular pathogens [39]. Similarly, kits containing proteinase K showed better yield of Brucella in serum specimens [40]. However, to enhance the sensitivity of PCR amplification, whole blood is considered as a final target because it contains more pathogens than serum or plasma [41]. Although commercially available nucleic acid kits were not developed to extract microbial DNA from whole blood, all commercial kits are able to do so [22]. In recent years, several automated systems have proven to be able to extract bacterial or fungal DNA from whole blood [31, 42, 43], although these instruments are expensive. They are suitable for high-throughput detection [44].",

It is different from whole blood in that the tiny specimen may contain very few causative pathogens. At present, many kinds of commercial or non-commercial DBS are in use. Because the amount of blood is small, inadequate DNA extraction can be a problem and result in a low sensitivity. Several investigators attempted to detect CMV DNA in DBS using several extraction methods and found that the recovery of CMV DNA differed according to the extraction method used [47\u201351]. The lysis buffer used also can affect the yield of RNA from DBS, and column extraction methods revealed significant loss in RNA recovery [52].",

            "text": "Fungi are problematic when attempting to extract nucleic acid because it is difficult to break their cell walls in order to release the DNA [15, 43]. Moreover, the detection rates in certain clinical specimens such as whole blood are low because of the very low loads of fungal cells [54\u201356]. So the extraction process once again is a crucial step and can determine the sensitivity of a particular PCR assay [57, 58]. There was an important report concerning nucleic acid extraction for Aspergillus published by the European Aspergilus PCR Initiative. About 50% of failures to detect Aspergillus were attributable to the low concentration of nucleic acids extracted from the organisms in whole blood [59, 60]. The authors also pointed out that the PCR efficiency of Aspergillus is determined not by the PCR amplification but by NA exaction. Most common NA extraction methods for bacteria and viruses are not adequate for fungi. Indeed, NA extraction from fungi needs different procedures, including bead beating, freezing, and larger specimen volumes [60\u201363]. To recover small amounts of fungal DNA from clinical specimens, a protocol should be established for an optimal extraction method. The QIAamp DNA blood kit was successful in extracting Candida DNA and was suitable to use with a TaqMan-based PCR assay, whereas all other kits tested failed to detect low amounts of Candida DNA [15]. Perry et al. [60] reported that the Qiagen EZ1 Advanced XL and Roche MagNA Pure LC platforms were suitable for A. fumigatus DNA extraction from EDTA-treated whole blood. However, there were significant differences between automated NA extraction instruments. Those investigators finally concluded that full validation of the NA extraction efficiency should be done even though others have reported good validation results with other organisms. In another study, the investigators were successful with all of the extraction methods used in their study, even though those kits were not specifically designed for the extraction of fungal DNA from whole blood [64]. A similar difficulty in extracting nucleic acid from Mycobacteria has been observed by the author of this chapter. Many researchers have tried to find optimal extraction methods for most clinically important specimens; the most appropriate method for each laboratory\u2019s situation should be applied [65].",

It is well known that bile salts, hemoglobin, and polysaccharides can inhibit PCR [66, 67]. There also may be contaminating bacterial or fungal DNA in the reagents [40, 64, 68]. Most PCR assays can be influenced by reaction inhibitors and other contaminants, especially when the various clinical specimens containing these inhibitors are used as samples, and nucleic acid extraction thus becomes the crucial step that determines their influence [69]. In previous reports [30, 70], the presence of inhibitors was confirmed when the MagNA Pure Compact system was used for a principal nucleic acid extraction. In one other report [46], the authors compared the MagNA Pure Compact system and QIAamp DNA mini kit for the detection of Toxoplasma DNA from blood. The sensitivity of PCR using the MagNA Pure Compact system was lower than that of the QIAamp DNA mini kit, so the presence of inhibitors may have been responsible for the difference of sensitivity between the two methods. Moreover, the combination of the extraction kit and the master mix can make a difference in PCR performance in terms of inhibition [45]. One should also consider the fact that many human DNAs are mixed with relatively rare pathogen DNAs in clinical specimens, meaning abundant human DNA will be obtained during extraction for pathogen detection [71].",

Therefore, problems with reproducibility by different persons can be seen. To minimize such reproducibility problems, it is necessary to provide continuous training and quality control [5]. Ethanol is used for precipitation of the nucleic acid in some manual kits, and inhibition of the PCR reaction can occur when this ethanol is not completely removed [80]. The manual extraction method has been designated as a high-complexity test according to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA \u201888) regulations (http://www.cms.hhs.gov/clia/), so only trained laboratory personnel can perform it. Moreover, the number of specimens for molecular testing is increasing, which places more stress on the technologist who are processing these specimens. This can affect the accuracy of tests as a result of a processing mistake or by contamination attributable to the complex processing procedure.",
