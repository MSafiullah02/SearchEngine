Areas where detection of microbial pathogens is critical include clinical diagnosis, water and environmental analysis, food safety, and biodefense. Microbial culture-based tests and molecular assays (immunological or nucleic acid technologies) are the most common methodologies currently used (Lazcka et al., 2007). These techniques are either time consuming or require sophisticated equipment and highly trained personnel, hence increasing the analysis cost. Rapid detection techniques should provide reliable, real time, on-field, user-friendly, and inexpensive detection with improved or equivalent sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of culture-based tests (Alocilja and Radke, 2003). According to Lazcka et al. (2007), biosensor technology is the fastest growing area in rapid pathogen detection. The commonly used biological recognition elements in biosensor platforms are antibodies and nucleic acid probes.",

In diagnostic and detection assays, aptamers represent an alternative to antibodies as recognition agents. Aptamers are selected through an in vitro process, which represents lower cost and less batch-to-batch variation than antibody in vivo production. Furthermore, toxins and molecules that do not elicit a good immune response can be used to generate high affinity aptamers (O'Sullivan, 2002, Proske et al., 2005).",

The methodology consists of screening large random oligonucleotide libraries through iterative cycles of in vitro selection and enzymatic amplification (Ellington and Szostak, 1990, Tuerk and Gold, 1990, Robertson and Joyce, 1990). Briefly, SELEX starts with incubation of the nucleic-acid sequence library with the target (protein, antibody, enzyme, etc.), followed by separation and exponential amplification of the binding oligonucleotides. This process is repeated (typically 8\u201315 times) using the obtained enriched pool as starting library. Finally, cloning and sequencing of the final specific binding molecules allow identification of the best sequences (Fig. 1\n).",

Complex targets include non-whole-cell (cell surface molecules, membrane fragments, bacterial lysates, and viral particles) and whole-cell targets (Chu et al., 2007, Shamah et al., 2008). Proteins are the most common SELEX targets. Thrombin, an important protease in the coagulation cascade, has been the most studied target; its aptamer sequences have been used as biological recognition agents in the design and development of biosensors (Tombelli et al., 2007). Aptamers are target-conformation specific, which means that if the target protein conformation changes, the binding event will be affected or may not occur. In order to get consistency within the SELEX cycles, it is necessary to use the target in the most stable conformation. Therefore, in some diagnostic and therapeutic applications, target proteins that are expressed on cell membranes cannot be introduced into SELEX as isolated and purified proteins. They need to be presented as cell fragment preparations (non-whole-cell targets) or intact whole cells (Shamah et al., 2008). These targets are commonly called \u201ccomplex targets.\u201d",

Clinical applications of aptamers include their use as therapeutic agents (Lee et al., 2006, Ng et al., 2006), anti-infective agents (Ulrich et al., 2002), and as drug delivery molecules (Bagalkot et al., 2007, Xiao et al., 2008). One of the most studied applications is the identification of cell surface markers for cancer detection. Some target examples include lymphoma (Ramos) cells (Tang et al., 2007), leukemia cells (Shangguan et al., 2006), brain tumor microvessel (endothelial) cells (Blank et al., 2001), and brain tumor (glioblastoma) cells (Daniels et al., 2003). Although several aptamer studies have been published about individual protein targets, few aptamers for microorganisms, particularly for whole-cell detection, have been identified. Some examples will be reviewed in the present work. Most of these aptamers have been developed for clinical diagnostics and infection inhibitor agents.",

One of its principal advantages is the ability to target specific pathological cell stages or cell types without having previous knowledge of the membrane molecules or structural changes related to that cell stage or type (Daniels et al., 2003, Hamula et al., 2006). Cellular aptamers can be applied to isolate, concentrate, and identify particular cells from biological matrices (Guo et al., 2006). One of the first models for complex-target SELEX used human red blood cell membranes as target (Morris et al., 1998). In the report, ligands to specific target molecules in the complex mixture were isolated and identified using a deconvolution-SELEX strategy. Deconvolution, a secondary selection step, allows for the partitioning of the aptamer pool generated from the SELEX process that has evolved against multiple targets (Fitter and James, 2005) (Fig. 1). This step involves: (a) evaluation of aptamer's ability to specifically bind, capture, and identify the target (Blank et al., 2001); or (b) incubation of the last selected aptamer pool with the target, in order to identify and isolate potential specific protein targets within the complex mixture, using magnetic capture beads and SDS/PAGE analysis (Morris et al., 1998, Fitter and James, 2005).",

During the selection cycles, a selective displacement step was applied to the RNA molecules that bound to the T. cruzi surfaces. The four host cell molecules were incubated with the parasite\u2013aptamer complexes and the displaced RNA molecules were used as starting library for the next selection cycle. The obtained RNA ligands specifically bound to the parasite receptors of the host cell matrix molecules. Also, all aptamer classes obtained were able to inhibit T. cruzi invasion in vitro (Ulrich et al., 2002). The development of potential anti-parasitic drugs has been the main application of the trypanosome aptamer research.

Recently, two different strategies for whole-cell detection, using quantum dots (QDs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), have been reported. Aptamer-functionalized QDs have been used to detect Bacillus thuringiensis spores (Ikanovic et al., 2007). In the study, zinc sulfide-capped cadmium selenide QDs were functionalized with a specific aptamer selected to detect B. thuringiensis. After QD-aptamer incubation with the target, the spores were washed and collected for fluorescence measurement. Several controls with non-functionalized QDs and without spores were tested to measure the non-specific attachment of the QDs to the spores and the fluorescence background noise. The reported sensitivity was 103\n CFU/ml. For specificity purposes, spores from B. globigii (B. subtilis var. niger) were also tested. The system could differentiate B. thuringiensis from B. globigii at concentrations above 105\n CFU/ml. The second strategy was developed to detect E. coli DH5\u03b1, using aptamer-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotube field-effect transistor (SWNT-FET) arrays (So et al., 2008). The binding event between E. coli cells and the aptamer-functionalized FET produced a drop in conductance (>50%) in culture samples with concentrations between 105 and 107\n CFU/ml. Specificity assays were conducted with S. Typhimurium.",

These strategies can be potentially applied to the collection, concentration, and detection of microorganisms from complex matrices. Whole-cell aptamer detection platforms represent a promising alternative not only for clinical diagnostics, but also for foodborne and environmental pathogen detection. The principal challenge is the presence of multiple target proteins in the cell wall, which produces difficulty in the post-SELEX evaluation and binding standardization. Future successful application of aptamers in biosensors for whole-cell detection will be dependent upon the SELEX standardization for complex targets and the post-SELEX characterization of the obtained aptamers and their binding reaction with the cells.",

For detection, after the thiolated aptamer was immobilized onto gold nanoparticles, dye-labeled complementary DNA was hybridized with the aptamer, which resulted in fluorescence quenching.

The use of AuNP in the amplification of aptamer bio-barcodes has been investigated, using thrombin as target model (He et al., 2007). The proposed platform was based on a sandwich, label-free electrochemical detection. First, thrombin was captured by polyclonal antibodies immobilized in microtiter plates. The Ab\u2013target complex was then recognized by biotin-25polyA-15aptamer-AuNP bio-barcodes. The aptamer was then released and collected from the AuNPs. Finally, the modified aptamers with the polyadenine oligonucleotides (bio-barcodes) were degraded by nuclease or acid, and differential pulse voltammetry was used to detect the well-defined adenine signal (Fig. 3\n). The thrombin detection limit was 0.1 ng/ml (He et al., 2007). Another sandwich-type assay to detect thrombin was used to develop a microgravimetric quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) platform, using AuNP for the detection. The thiolated capture aptamer was immobilized on the QCM electrode. After incubation with the target (thrombin), the aptamer\u2013thrombin complex was recognized by the AuNPs functionalized with the detection aptamer. The AuNP attachment to the QCM surface provided initial thrombin analysis amplification, resulting in a frequency change. Secondary analysis amplification was obtained with the catalytic enlargement of AuNP in the presence of HAuCl4 and NADH, with a sensitivity of 20 nM. The use of aptamer-functionalized AuNPs as catalytic labels for thrombin analysis amplification in solution was also established (Pavlov et al., 2004).",

(2007) used two aptamer-functionalized QDs, with different fluorescence emission wavelength for simultaneous detection of adenosine and cocaine, containing AuNPs as quenchers. QDs were assembled with AuNPs by the specific aptamer, quenching the QD fluorescence emission. Addition of the targets (adenosine and cocaine) disassembled the aggregates, resulting in increased fluorescence. The targets were simultaneously detected by fluorescence and colorimetric measurements in solution (Liu et al., 2007). QD\u2013aptamer systems have also been used to detect thrombin (Levy et al., 2005, Choi et al., 2006). Hansen et al. (2006) developed an electrochemical aptasensor using QDs to detect thrombin and lysozyme simultaneously. A gold electrode was functionalized with thiolated aptamers for each protein. QD-tagged proteins (CdS for thrombin and PbS for lysozyme) were bound to the corresponding aptamer into the gold substrate. In the presence of the target proteins, the QD\u2013protein complexes were displaced and the remaining nanocrystals were electrochemically detected. The position and size of the corresponding metal peaks (Cd and Pb) in the voltammograms corresponded to the type and amount of the respective protein target (thrombin and lysozyme) (Hansen et al., 2006).",

One of the main disadvantages of using a whole-cell target approach in SELEX is that the specific target molecule is initially unknown, which can cause specificity problems and can also produce difficulty in the post-SELEX optimization of the binding assay between the obtained aptamer sequence and the target. Some alternatives to overcome these issues are the use of counter-selection steps with closely related species, and the use of deconvolution-SELEX steps to partition the initial aptamer pools against the multiple targets present in cell surfaces.",

Aptamer application to detect environmental and foodborne pathogens is a promising area of research. Matrix complexity is one of the greatest challenges in molecular diagnostic application to foodborne pathogen detection. Several components regularly present in food samples can produce interference or cross-reaction in both immunology-based and nucleic acid-based detection systems. Therefore, additional isolation, concentration and/or purification of the microbial target is required before molecular detection, which increases the assay time and cost. However, the ability to select aptamers in real complex matrices represents a way to overcome these issues. Several aptasensor platforms for detecting pathogenic proteins have been developed, especially for viral proteins detection. Aptasensors for microbial whole-cell identification are a promising and challenging application, with potential advantages over existing immunological whole-cell biosensors.",
