This may indicate that respiratory droplets and close contact are the primary routes of transmission. This finding also showed that benefits of reducing the flow of people and large gatherings as well as staying at home and self-isolation have begun to take effect on reducing transmission [4] . 2 The study included 48 female patients and 51 male patients, including 19 male and 13 female critically ill patients. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups(p-value 0.293 > 0.05). 3 The mean age of critically ill patients was 63.8 years, whereas that of noncritically ill patients was 42.5 years [5] . This difference (pvalue 0.000 < 0.001) was extremely significant and statistically significant. With an increase in age, the probability of occurrence of basic diseases also increased significantly. Of all patients, 41 cases had significant chronic disease. Among the critically ill patients, 17 cases had heart-related disease, 3 cases had type 2 diabetes, and 1 patient had bronchitis. Among noncritically ill patients, 5 cases had hepatitis, 4 had heart disease, and 3 had diabetes. Among these patients, 49 patients did not have significant chronic disease and were classified as noncritically ill patients [6] . We found significant statistical differences between the two groups (\u03c72, 0.000 < 0.001).Elderly patients with significant cardiovascular disease were prone to develop critical illness and had extremely high mortality rates [7] . 4 In addition to lung disease and acute respiratory distress syndrome in critically ill patients, the blood system, myocardium, and immunity showed significant damage. In terms of white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, c-reactive protein, CKMB, MYO, TNTHSST, NT-ProBNP, PT, FDP, D-Dimer, CD4, and CD8, we observed a very significant difference between critically ill and noncritically ill patients [8] : p-values for CRP, TNTHSST, PT, FDP, D-Dimer, and CD4 were p < 0.001 and p-values for WBC, NEU, LYM, CKMB, MYO, NT-proBNP, and CD8 were p < 0.05.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 170, "end": 173, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 466, "end": 469, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 803, "end": 806, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1420, "end": 1423, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1649, "end": 1652, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2059, "end": 2062, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In critically ill patients who had worsening of the disease, we observed progressively decreased blood leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, CD4, and CD8, and increased myocardial damage, cardiac function indexes, and coagulation indexes. In cases of the virus that were detected early, we observed relatively less damage to the liver and kidneys [9] . The death cases progressed rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, difficult-to-correct metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy and multiple organ failure. In general, the severity of disease for most patients could be determined according to these clinical characteristics 1 week after admission, and patients could be identified as improving or dying 2-3 weeks after admission [10] . Creactive protein > 49.6 mg/l, MYO > 97.5 ng/mL, TNTHSST > 24.8 pg/mL, NT-proBNP > 1085.5 pg/mL, PT > 14.5 s, FDP > 6.7 ug/mL, D-Dimer > 2.6 ug/mL, CD4 < 274 cells/ul, and CD8 < 202 cells/ul were relatively dangerous and demonstrated a manifestation of critical illness. This finding was similar to cases reported from the hospital in Wuhan [11] . 5 The average length of hospital stay for all patients was 24 days, with a minimum of 5days and a maximum of 50 days. The average length of hospital stay for critically ill patients was 36 days, and for noncritically ill patients was 18 days. We identified significant statistical differences between the two groups (p-value 0.000, < 0.001). 6 This retrospective study has some obvious shortcomings. For example, in many laboratory inspections, we could not completely collect data according to the admission stage. At these stages, such as when the patient was newly admitted, when the condition changed, when the patient improved, or when they died, we could distinguish the progress of each patient's condition. Therefore, some indicators lacked a certain degree of comparability.
