Put simply, I will be looking for justice.\nThe object of my care and attention will be a character that appears in many accounts of\nthe 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. A character by the name of\nDr. Hong Tao. According to those accounts, Dr. Hong was the Chinese microbiologist who\nsought, but failed (and failed spectacularly), to discover the\naetiological agent responsible for causing the outbreak. But he did not just fail. For\nit seems that he also acted to \u2018promote\u2019 his discovery in such a way that other\nmicrobiologists in China were subsequently unable to put forward what was, ultimately,\nthe correct aetiological claim. His failure, and his inability to accept his failure, it\nseems, managed to hold the international response to the outbreak back by a good number\nof weeks. Reading of his actions during early 2003, it is difficult not to understand\nDr. Hong as one of the SARS outbreak's great scientific losers. But does he deserve this\nreputation? I want to suggest not. In fact, I want to defend him. And\nhere, the legal metaphor seems apt. Given the overall aims of this chapter, it seems\nonly fair that it should come to act as something akin to a \u2018scientific court of\nappeal\u2019. Whilst seeking to understand how accounts of past epidemics relate to their\nprimary data, we can safely leave our heroes \u2013 the Robert Kochs and the Louis Pasteurs\nof this world \u2013 to bask in their own accumulated glory. After all, they would have no\ninterest in such a project. But our scientific losers? Well they would, to a man (and\nsometimes to a woman), be clamouring for a re-trial. And the very least a sociologist\nlike myself can do is to take up the case of a character like Dr. Hong, asking whether\nor not he deserves his sentence of a life-long stretch lurking around amongst the\ndiscarded refuse in science's back yard.1\n",

            "text": "The case for the defence will be built around a close rhetorical examination of just\none particular account of Hong's actions: \u2018China's missed chance\u2019 (CMC). CMC was a \u2018news\nfocus special report\u2019 that appeared in the 18 July 2003 edition of the prestigious\njournal Science. Written by the highly respected science journalist\nMartin Enserink, it was the first article to tell of the outbreak during the\n\u2018post-outbreak\u2019 period. The interesting thing about CMC is that in order to understand\nHong's SARS laboratory work, in order to incorporate Hong into its overall narrative, it\nrelies on just one piece of material evidence: a research article entitled\n\u2018Chlamydia-like particles and coronavirus-like agents found in dead\ncases of atypical pneumonia by electron microscopy\u2019 (CLA). Written by Dr. Hong and his\nresearch colleagues, it was published in the 25 April edition of the National\nMedical Journal of China. That CMC is dependent on CLA in this way generates\nan interesting analytical opportunity, and one that I seek to take advantage of. It\narises because I too have access to CLA.2 And in the first section of this chapter, CMC's cross-examination\ncommences with a discussion of the ways in which my own understanding of Hong's\nlaboratory work differs from Enserink's. Reading of Hong's actions in CMC it is\ndifficult not to conjure the image of an inept scientist. Yet my own reading leads me to\nsuggest that Hong could, quite plausibly, have been represented in a far more favourable\nlight. In section two, a great deal of attention is given over to understanding how\nCMC's rhetorical structuring actually enabled Hong's original conviction. Then, in a bid\nto strengthen the appeal case a little further, the third section explores the ways in\nwhich subsequent accounts of the SARS outbreak came to relate to,\nengage with and appropriate CMC. In doing so, two things become clear: first, that CMC\nwas rapidly turned into a \u2018definitive historical account\u2019 of Hong's actions, whilst\nHong's own account of his own actions was completely\nignored; and second, that CMC's account was, on a number of occasions, actually\nembellished, with some authors adding their own twists to the tale,\naccentuating Hong's errors and personal failings to such an extent that CMC begins to\nappear as if the very model of restraint and fairness. A brief concluding section, the\nfourth section , looks up from this localised case in order to ask whether these\nprocesses might not actually be more general phenomena, inf(l)ecting other (seemingly)\nfactual and (seemingly) unquestionable accounts of past emerging epidemics.",

The scientific research groups in question were: a\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) laboratory network led by Dr. Klaus St\u00f6hr, a research\nteam working out of the Academy of Military Sciences (AMMS) in Beijing and led by Dr.\nYang Ruifu and, finally, Dr. Hong's research team at the Chinese Centre for Disease\nControl (CCDC), also in Beijing.",

            "text": "According to Enserink, the group that really won this race was the\nAMMS, led by Dr. Ruifu. \u2018By the first week of March\u2019, he suggests, \u2018the group had\ntentative evidence that a new virus might indeed be linked to the\nepidemic\u2019 (2003, p. 294). Having \u2018grow[n] a\nvirus of some sort from the samples in so-called vero cells\u2019, \u2018they [had] observed what\nlooked like coronavirus particles in an electron micrograph\u2019. The team \u2018also discovered\nthat serum from SARS patients could inhibit the growth of the virus \u2013 a key test to show\na correlation between an isolated agent and a disease\u2019 (2003, p. 295). As Enserink makes\nclear, having achieved all of this they were \u2018weeks ahead\u2019 of the researchers in the WHO\nlaboratory network (ibid.). And yet the AMMS were, nevertheless, to be\ndenied the prize of a \u2018prominent place in the history of the disease, and perhaps even a\npublication or two in a prestigious scientific journal\u2019 by that very same group (2003,\np. 294). For on 16 April, some five weeks after the AMMS had reached the same\nconclusion, it was the WHO research team that were to receive all the plaudits,\nannouncing at a press conference in front of the world's media that the causal agent was\na hitherto unknown coronavirus. \u2018Looking back\u2019 at this episode, St\u00f6hr is quoted as\nsuggesting that \u2018had the AMMS researchers reported their findings immediately, the\nlarger group [the WHO SARS laboratory network] might have been on the right trail much\nsooner\u2019 (2003, pp. 295\u2013296). How had this situation arisen? Because, according to\nEnserink, the AMMS \u2018didn't dare tell the world\u2019 about their discovery (2003, p. 294). Their silence, however, was not\nself-imposed, but forced upon them through the actions of \u2018an esteemed senior\nmicrobiologist and member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering\u2019 \u2013 Dr. Hong \u2013 and the\ninstitution for which he worked \u2013 the CCDC (ibid.). In mid-February,\nHong \u2018proposed that the agent was a new type of Chlamydia\u2019 (2003, p.\n295). And even though \u2018others suggested that it may have been something different\naltogether\u2019 (ibid.), there was apparently no dissuading him: \u2018promoted\nby Hong Tao, an esteemed senior microbiologist and member of the Chinese Academy of\nEngineering, the Chlamydia hypothesis had become \u2026 well established\u2019\n(2003, p. 294). The CCDC, in conjunction with other institutions in China, subsequently\nforbade any further discussion of the aetiological question, and moved to prevent others\nfrom expressing alternate views. In late March, for instance, and \u2018bolstered by WHO's\ndaily reports and new, more solid data of their own, AMMS scientists reported their\nfindings to the Ministry of Health\u2019 (2003, p. 296). The result? \u2018The department stuck to\nthe Chlamydia theory\u2019, and set up \u2018a working group \u2026 to control\npublicity about SARS pathogen studies\u2019 (ibid.). Indeed, it was only as\nlate as the last week of April, after the Chinese health minister had been sacked for\nmishandling the outbreak, that the coronavirus discovery came to receive official\nacceptance within China (ibid.). But by then of course the AMMS team\nhad been pre-empted by the WHO, and it was too late for them to take any credit for the\ndiscovery. This, it seems, was \u2018China\u2019s missed chance\u2019.",

For therein, trapped within a parenthesis, is an\nacknowledgement that Hong had in fact \u2018noted\u2019 the coronavirus too. But before discussing\nthis peculiarity at any great length, I want to present the abstract from the original\nsource document CLA (the most relevant sections have been underlined):OBJECTIVE: To\nexplore the causative agents of the atypical pneumonia (also SARS) that occurred\nrecently in some regions of [China]. METHOD: Organ samples of 7 dead cases of SARS were\ncollected from Guangdong, Shanxi, Sichuan Provinces and Beijing for electron microscopic\nexamination. 293 cell lines were inoculated with the materials derived from the lungs in\norder to isolate the causative agent(s). The agents in the organs and cell cultures were\nrevealed by immunoassay. RESULTS: Both Chlamydia-like and\ncoronavirus-like particles were found by electron microscope. Inclusion bodies\ncontaining elementary bodies, reticulate antibodies and intermediate bodies of\nChlamydia-like agent were visualised in multiple organs from the 7\ndead cases, including lungs (7 cases), spleens (2 cases), livers (2 cases), kidneys (3\ncases) and lymph nodes (1 case), by ultra-thin section EM [electron microscope]. In some\nfew sections, coronavirus-like particles were concurrently seen. A coronavirus\nRNA-polymerase segment (440 bp) was amplified from the lung tissues of two cases. After\ninoculation with materials from the lung samples, similar\nChlamydia-like particles were also found in the inoculated 293 cells.\nSince the Chlamydia-like agents visualized in both organs and cell\ncultures did not react with the genus specific antibodies against\nChlamydia and monoclonal antibodies against C.\npneumoniae and C. psittaci, the results might well be\nsuggestive of a novel Chlamydia-like agent. CONCLUSION: Since the novel\nChlamydia-like agent was found co-existing with a coronavirus-like\nagent in the dead cases of SARS, it appears most likely that both agents play some role\nin the disease. At the present time, however, it is not possible to determine whether\nthese agents interact synergistically, or whether one follows another. This requires\nfurther study.

(In two, he\nalso noted the presence of a coronavirus)\u2019 (Enserink,\n2003, p. 295). Although both sentences seek to capture and represent a process\nof discovery, they do so in different ways. And this difference, though slight, is\nhighly consequential. To make this point a little clearer the sentential units can be\nbroken down into their constituent parts: actor, process and goal4:In both, the actor quite obviously remains as Hong. The goals, too, remain\nsimilar \u2013 although differently named entities, they are, nevertheless, entities of a\nsimilar, pathogenic order. The real difference, the difference that\nmakes a difference, is to be found when the processes are examined. In the first\ninstance, Hong \u2018reports\u2019 on his engagement with Chlamydia. \u2018To report\u2019\nis to perform not a material, but a mental action process.5 Considered as an action in and of itself, a report would\ninvolve a conscious being sensing a phenomenon before then making that which had been\nsensed known to others. But in this particular instance the report is a report that a\npathogen had been \u2018found\u2019. And this second process verb, \u2018to find\u2019, immediately implies\nthat some kind of material action process had also taken place \u2013 a\nprocess of doing and not simply of sensing. In order for Hong's \u2018report\u2019 to have become\npossible, he would have had to have made some kind of material contact with the\nbacterium through, say, a laboratory instrument. To find, in other words, is to found;\nto found a relationship, the actor having at least a degree of human interest in the\nobject found. In the second sentence, Hong \u2018notes the presence of\u2019 a coronavirus. To\n\u2018note\u2019 is to do something very similar to reporting. Both are mental process actions\nthat involve sensing. But unlike in the first sentence, this mental process action is\nnot followed by a material process action. Hong, as a conscious being, simply notes the\npresence of a phenomenon before making that which he had sensed apparent to others. No\nmaterial contact with the coronavirus is implied in any of this.",

Perhaps it suggests an action that\nteeters on the edge of not being a discovery at all. To \u2018note\u2019 is merely to acknowledge\nthe presence of an object in passing, remaining at a certain remove from that object\nbefore then moving on somewhere else. It is, on Simpson's reading, to leave the entity\n\u2018unaffected\u2019 by the process. Another way to make the rhetorical significance of\nEnserink's lexical choices clear is to consider culturally entrenched ways of using\nlanguage in scientific practice.

Where CLA indicated that both the coronavirus and the\nChlamydia findings were of equal ontological standing, leaving their\nstatus as discovered objects clear and uncomplicated, CMC erodes this sense of equality\nvia the use of process verbs that evoke differing levels of actorial contact with, and\ninterest in, their end\u2013goal.",

That \u2018Chlamydia-like particles\u2019 \u2013 in the\nplural \u2013 were found in all seven of Hong's samples is a point that is left outside the\nparenthesis. That \u2018a coronavirus\u2019 \u2013 in the singular \u2013 was noted in just two samples is a\npoint that is placed inside the parenthesis. This, then, is what it does. But it is not\nat all clear why it is made to do what it does here.\nIndeed, the separation is especially curious given that Hong's own research article goes\nout of its way to avoid making any such separation. The very title of the article \u2013\n\u2018Chlamydia-like and coronavirus-like agents found in dead cases \u2026\u2019 \u2013\nseeks to draw the two discoveries together. Further, in CLA's conclusions, their\nentanglement with one another is once again made clear: \u2018since the novel\nChlamydia-like agent was found co-existing with a coronavirus-like\nagent in the dead cases of SARS, it appears most likely that both agents play some role\nin the disease\u2019 (Hong et al., 2003, p. 636).\nCMC's brackets, however, cut off all links between the two discoveries. And although\nlittle has been written about parentheses in rhetorical theory, the concept of\nenactment, taken from the field of stylistics, helps to make the rhetorical significance\nof this \u2018cutting\u2019 operation a little clearer.7 The critical and stylistic assumption underpinning the concept is\nthat literary forms can mime the meanings they seek to express. So, for instance, in\nDickens's Oliver Twist, a stylistician might note how the following\npassage seeks to enact movement, noise and confusion in and as a\ndescription of the actions of movement, noise and confusion:Away they ran, pell-mell,\nhelter-skelter, slap-dash, tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as\nthey turn corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls: and streets, squares\nand courts re-echo with the sound.8\n",

The very presence of the parenthesis, the cognitive brackets, is in this way\ngranted an explanation. And although not perhaps entirely convincing to a reader with\nsome first-hand knowledge of CLA, it is at least plausible: Hong's context of discovery,\nit seems, was a context built around quantitative criteria. Fascinated by the\nChlamydia-like particles and their abundance in relation to the\ncoronavirus particles, Hong completely overlooked the aetiological significance of the\nlatter. Through the use of the parenthesis, CMC generates a sense that, even\nif we can allow that Hong's coronavirus was a discovery rather than a noting,\nit was, nevertheless, a discovery that Hong himself regarded as\nsecondary and unimportant in relation to Chlamydia.",

The consequence of this\nimmediacy is that any sense of a lag time between the finding and the\nact of communicating the finding is lost. In classical rhetorical\nterms, we no longer watch as Enserink \u2018tells\u2019 of something. Instead, we watch as\nEnserink \u2018shows\u2019 us an act that appears to be fully present to him. But, if this is so,\nwhat we need to ask now is when is Enserink's immediacy in this\nformulation? When is he watching Hong doing his noting?

Because \u2018by\nthen\u2019 has to suggest a date after 16 April, that is, the date on which the WHO\nofficially announced that the coronavirus was the causal agent of SARS. By implication,\nthe only way in which Enserink's \u2018by then\u2019 could be referring to 18 February was if it\nwas somehow trying to suggest that Hong, in some bizarrely schizophrenic manoeuvre, had\nmanaged to pre-empt himself (\u2018in two he also noted the presence of a coronavirus, which\nby then he had already discovered \u2026\u2019).

Let us imagine,\ninstead, that in both cases he had been focalising Hong's research article.

By\nimplication, if the coronavirus discovery had taken place on or around that same day, or\nindeed at any point before 16 April, then irrespective of the date when the\narticle was published, Enserink would, logically, have had to admit that\nHong, in \u2018noting\u2019 the coronavirus, had pre-empted both the AMMS and the WHO laboratory\nnetwork. What I take from all of this sleuthing around is a proof that Enserink's \u2018by\nthen\u2019 simply has to be a reference to the coronavirus discovery, and\nthe coronavirus discovery alone. What I also take from it is a certain confidence that\nmy suspicions were correct: Enserink was indeed playing around with the difference\nbetween \u2018telling\u2019 and \u2018showing\u2019 in his reporting of the two discoveries.

When scientists in Beijing identified a new virus in late February, they\nchose not to say anything about it. (Balasegaram &\nSchnur, 2006, p. 75)3. The medical community's understanding of the true\naetiology of SARS was delayed significantly by a February announcement from a senior\nscientist at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control that he suspected the infectious\nagent was Chlamydia \u2013 a commonly understood bacterial agent that would\nnot have warranted heightened concern of investigation.

It is now Hong, and Hong alone, who\nstands responsible for the false claim. The all powerful, yet totally inept superman. A\nline of moral responsibility is drawn, leading straight from this \u2018senior scientist\u2019 to\nthe \u2018significant delay\u2019 in the medical community's attempts to get to grips with the\noutbreak. Even the identity of Hong's Chlamydia-like particles is now\ncharacterised in such a way as to make him appear ridiculous. In extract 1, for\ninstance, we are able to laugh at a \u2018fact\u2019 that the cited source, CMC, never mentions:\nHong's belief that a sexually transmitted infection could have caused an outbreak of\nupper respiratory tract disease. And yet the joke, I would suggest, is on the author of\nextract 1. For there is more than one Chlamydia \u2018bacterium\u2019. Hong, in\nCLA, merely refers to the viral family Chlamydiaceae, of the class Chlamydiae. Included\nwithin this family are two genera: Chlamydia and\nChlamydophila. The species Chlamydia trachomatis,\nwhich causes \u2018sexually transmitted disease\u2019, is only one of the three\nChlamydia species, and only one of the nine species included within\nthe overall family Chlamydiaceae. In CLA, Hong never mentions C.\ntrachomatis. But he does mention Chlamydia pneumoniae and\nChlamydia psittaci, species which are both known to cause\npneumonia-like illness. And finally, consider extract 2. Here, Dr. Hong even has his\nplace of work and his geographical location within China manipulated! Cast in the role\nof \u2018local doctor from the rural provinces\u2019, Hong-the-simpleton now appears only in order\nto frustrate the AMMS, the thrusting, big city research group from Beijing.",

For what is perhaps most interesting\nabout this particular episode is the epidemic of literature that the\nepidemic disease seems to have generated.

Indeed, if emerging disease\nepidemics can be said to imply unpredictability and rapid evolutionary mutation, then\nperhaps historical accounts, in seeking to interpret and to story them, take on some of\nthose very same characteristics: the disease epidemic and the\nliterary epidemic; the pathogen as tropic and the trope as\npathogenic. But then, if this is so, it raises an interesting (rhetorical) question, and\none that I want to leave the jury to ponder: who would bet against there being plenty\nmore Dr. Hongs out there, that is, scientists of all kinds, from all eras and all\ncorners of the world, lost in the prison-house of language and in need of sociological\nrepresentation?",
