Negative pressure is created and maintained by a ventilation system that allows extra air to enter the isolated room by differential pressure, and be exhausted directly to the outside or be filtered through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter directly before recirculation.

Therefore, the panel issued a suggestion to use medical masks in this context. However, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be more easily transmissible and lethal than seasonal influenza. Specifically, an early estimate of the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2, the average number of people an infected person subsequently infects as a function of biological properties of the pathogen in combination with social and environmental factors, is 2.3 [27]. By comparison, the estimated average R0 for the 1918 influenza pandemic that resulted in an estimated 50 million deaths globally was 1.8, and the estimated average R0 for seasonal influenza is 1.28 [28]. Therefore, a minimum of a surgical/medical mask is recommended for healthcare workers caring for non-ventilated COVID-19 patients and for healthcare workers who are performing non-aerosol-generating procedures on mechanically ventilated (closed circuit) patients with COVID-19.

While SARS-CoV-2 appears to be predominantly spread by large respiratory droplets, intubation is likely a small particle (less than 5 \u03bcm) aerosol-generating procedure, which increases the risk of transmission to healthcare workers [29]. Intubation is particularly risky given the close contact of healthcare workers with the patient\u2019s airway and respiratory secretions. Thus, techniques that can reduce the number of attempts at endotracheal intubation and the duration of the procedure and minimize the proximity between the operator and the patient, should be prioritized, potentially reducing the risk of complications in hypoxic COVID-19 patients. In a systematic review including 64 studies and 7044 patients, video-laryngoscopy reduced the risk of failed intubation (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.19\u20130.65), without a significant impact upon the proportion of successful first-pass attempts (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.48\u20131.3), hypoxia (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.1\u20131.44), or time for tracheal intubation [30, 31].

            "text": "The procedures involved in laboratory RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 using a number of assays currently in use are well described [35]. Despite the generally high sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR-based assays [36], it may not be enough to rely on oropharyngeal swabs specimens alone for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis due to their low negative predictive value. In a recent study, only 9 out of 19 (47%) oropharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients tested positive by RT-PCR [37]. Similar data were reported using RT-PCR during the 2002\u20132003 SARS epidemic [38]. Using seroconversion as the \u201cgold standard\u201d for SARS diagnosis, RT-PCR assays performed on nasopharyngeal and throat specimens were positive only 65 and 70% of the time, respectively. However, no false positives were observed indicating assay specificity of 100%. Similarly, in a study accounting for CT scan findings among suspected COVID-19 cases, 48% with negative oropharyngeal or nasal swabs were considered highly likely cases, and 33% were considered probable cases [39]. Consequently, a single negative swab from the upper airway does not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection and repeated sampling from multiple sites, including the lower airway, will increase diagnostic yield. Similarly, given that coinfection with other viral pathogens has been observed, a positive test for another respiratory virus does not rule out COVID-19, and should not delay testing if there is a high suspicion of COVID-19 [40]. Given this high specificity, a single positive swab confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19 and is enough to trigger infection control precautions and appropriate treatment of the patient.",

In an RCT comparing HFNC with conventional oxygen therapy in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, HFNC resulted in reduced 90-day mortality (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21\u20130.85), but did not reduce the risk of intubation [71]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 9 RCTs (2093 patients) showed that HFNC reduces intubation compared with conventional oxygen (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74\u20130.99), but does not affect the risk of death or ICU length of stay [72\u201374]. Even though the evidence on mortality and length of stay was not as strong, the reduction in the need for intubation is an important finding, particularly from the perspective of pandemics such as COVID-19, where resources such as critical care beds and ventilators may become limited. In addition, in SARS, there are reports of increased transmission of disease to healthcare workers, especially nurses, during endotracheal intubation (OR 6.6, 95% Cl 2.3\u201318.9) [29, 75, 76]. Although this is a finding based mostly on retrospective observational studies, HFNC does not seem to confer an increased risk of transmission of disease. In studies evaluating bacterial environmental contamination, HFNC presented a contamination risk similar to that of conventional oxygen [77]. In SARS, healthcare workers exposed to HFNC were not at increased risk of developing disease [75]. Finally, patients may find HFNC more comfortable than, or at least as comfortable as, conventional oxygen therapy [71, 74]. Although some authors advised avoiding the use of HFNC in patients with COVID-19 due to the fear of disease transmission, studies supporting this advice are lacking [78]. Although some have proposed that patients wear face masks while on HFNC therapy, we are uncertain about the efficacy and safety of this approach. This question could be addressed in future studies.",

In an RCT comparing HFNC with NIPPV in patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure, HFNC resulted in reduced mortality at 90 days (HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.31\u20134.78), but did not significantly affect the need for intubation (50% failure rate in NIPPV vs 47% in conventional oxygen and 40% in HFNC groups; p = 0.18) [71]. Another meta-analysis comparing HFNC with NIPPV showed HFNC to decrease the need for intubation of patients, yet without significantly reducing mortality or ICU length of stay [72]. Additionally, patients may find HFNC more comfortable than NIPPV [71]. Given the evidence for a decreased risk of intubation with HFNC compared with NIPPV in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, and studies suggesting that NIPPV may carry a greater risk of nosocomial infection of healthcare providers, we suggest HFNC over NIPPV. However, any patients receiving HFNC or NIPPV should be monitored closely and cared for in a setting where intubation can be facilitated in the event of decompensation, as the failure rate may be high and emergency intubation in an uncontrolled setting may increase the risk of nosocomial infection of healthcare providers [79, 80].",

However, NIPPV was associated with a high failure rate (92.4%), leading to intubation. Patients who received NIPPV prior to intubation had increased inhaled nitric oxide requirements and increased mortality [79]. Failure rates in other pandemics, such as influenza, H1N1 and SARS, range from 10 to 70%, while demonstrations of efficacy mainly come from case series and observational studies rather than RCTs, leading to practice variation. In China, the use of NIPPV for pandemic respiratory infection is common, whereas guidelines from Europe, Hong Kong, and the US advise against NIPPV as a first-line therapy in H1N1 [84]. There are additional concerns over the use of NIPPV in respiratory pandemics like COVID-19: NIPPV may aggravate severe forms of lung injury as a result of injurious transpulmonary pressures and large tidal volumes [85, 86], and may delay initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation, leading to emergency or more unstable intubations that can increase the risk of transmission to the healthcare team [85]. In addition, NIPPV is an aerosol-generating procedure that can increase the risk of transmission of disease to healthcare workers [29]. Several other studies and meta-analyses of SARS have also highlighted the risk of nosocomial spread of the disease with NIPPV [76, 87].",

If, in certain COVID-19 patients, other forms of respiratory failure, such as acute hypercapnic respiratory failure or acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema, are known to be the cause of respiratory failure, NIPPV may be beneficial [88, 89]. However, because limited experience with NIPPV in pandemics suggests a high failure rate, we recommend that any patient receiving NIPPV be monitored closely and cared for in a setting where intubation can be facilitated in the event of decompensation [79, 80]. However, when resources become stretched, there may be insufficient ability to provide invasive ventilation, and even a moderate chance of success with NIPPV may justify its use.",

The limited data available on COVID-19 show that cardiac failure, alone or in combination with respiratory failure, was the cause of 40% of COVID-19 deaths [46]. Another study showed that 44% of COVID-19 patients had arrhythmia [43]. The data suggest the presence of myocardial injury in some patients with COVID-19. Few RCTs have been published that compare conservative or deresuscitative with liberal fluid strategies in ARDS. A recent systematic review included 5 RCTs enrolling 1206 patients with ARDS. The risk of death was similar in both groups: 28% in the conservative fluid strategy group and 31.1% in the liberal strategy group (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.77\u20131.07) [52]. This study included RCTs in critically ill patients with or without ARDS, and the authors found that a conservative fluid strategy increased ventilator-free days (MD 1.82 days; 95% CI 0.53\u20133.10 days) and reduced ICU length of stay (MD \u2212 1.88 days, 95% CI \u2212 0.12 to \u2212 3.64 days), compared with a liberal fluid strategy. There was no difference in harm, including renal failure between the two groups. The landmark trial in ARDS patients (FACTT) found a significant reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation with a conservative fluid strategy [109]. Furthermore, the majority of patients with COVID-19 in the ICU are elderly, and may develop myocardial dysfunction that could limit their ability to handle large fluid volumes [46]. In view of the moderate benefit observed in other ARDS populations, the possible reduced cost of administering less fluids, and the feasibility of the intervention, the panel issued a weak recommendation favoring conservative fluid strategy in patients with COVID-19 and ARDS",

No study assessed the use of inhaled nitric oxide as a \u201crescue\u201d therapy [126]. Because of the possible harm from inhaled nitric oxide and the absence of a clear mortality benefit, the panel issued a strong recommendation against its routine use in patients with ARDS. However, in view of the finding of improved oxygenation, a trial of inhaled nitric oxide as a \u201crescue\u201d therapy, after trying other options, is reasonable if available. If inhaled nitric oxide is used without a good response in terms of oxygenation, it should be tapered off to avoid rebound the pulmonary vasoconstriction that can occur with prolonged use and abrupt discontinuation.",

Convalescent plasma has been used to treat several other viral infections, including those caused by SARS coronavirus, avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, and influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus [178\u2013182]. A recent meta-analysis of observational studies using passive immunotherapy for the treatment of severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology suggests that convalescent plasma therapy was associated with reduction in mortality (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14\u20130.45) [183]. During the current outbreak in China, convalescent plasma was used in some patients with COVID-19 [184]. However, data on the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma are limited, and the target for sufficient levels of neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. A study on MERS concluded that use of convalescent plasma might be feasible but was challenging due to a small pool of potential donors with sufficiently high antibody titers [185]. An RCT in patients with confirmed Ebola virus disease showed that convalescent plasma, with unknown levels of neutralizing antibodies, was not associated with improvement in survival [186]. Another RCT in patients with seasonal influenza treated with high-titer versus low-titer anti-influenza immune plasma was terminated for futility because of the lack of effect on the primary outcome measured by a 6-point ordinal scale of clinical status on Day 7 [187]. Given the lack of convincing evidence from RCTs and the uncertainty surrounding the optimal preparation of convalescent plasma and its safety, we suggest that it should not be routinely used in treating patients with COVID-19 until more evidence is available.",

In addition, lopinavir/ritonavir was associated with more adverse events [194]. This trial is the only available direct evidence on the use of lopinavir/ritonavir in patients with COVID-19, however, it has several limitations. The trial was unblinded and it enrolled a small number of patients (n = 199) with a small number of events (44 deaths in total), which limits our confidence in its results. Nevertheless, the routine use of lopinavir/ritonavir in critically ill patients is probably not warranted, and a weak recommendation against the routine use of lopinavir/ritonavir in critically ill COVID-19 patients is reasonable.",

It was considered the most promising drug in an informal consultation on research prioritization of candidate therapeutic agents by WHO [195]. Currently, there are published case reports but no published trials on the use of remdesivir in COVID-19. Remdesivir demonstrated effective inhibition of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV in in vitro studies [196]. Furthermore, studies in animal models of MERS-CoV showed that it was more effective than control and superior to lopinavir/ritonavir combined with systemic IFN-\u03b2 [197, 198]. Although intravenous remdesivir appears to adequately tolerated, a recent RCT showed that it was less effective than several antibody therapies in Ebola virus disease [199]. There are several ongoing RCTs that aim to examine the efficacy and safety of intravenous remdesivir for severe COVID-19 (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04257656) and for mild and moderate COVID-19 (clinicaltrials.gov NCT04252664).

Prior studies found inhibitory effects of chloroquine for multiple RNA viruses in vitro, but RCTs in treatment of dengue and chikungunya virus infections and of influenza prophylaxis failed to demonstrate antiviral or clinical benefits [209]. In one non-human primate model of chikungunya infection, it was shown that chloroquine\u2019s immunomodulatory effects were associated with delayed immune responses, higher levels of viral replication, and worse illness [210]. A news briefing suggested that its use in more than 100 patients showed \u201cthat it was superior to the control in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus negative conversion, and shortening the disease course\u201d, but the data have not been published yet [211]. A recent consensus document recommended chloroquine phosphate 500 mg twice daily for minimum of 5 days, with dose modifications if severe gastrointestinal side effects occur [212]. Since chloroquine is not available in some countries, hydroxychloroquine is an alternative. A recent study in China explored various dosing regimens of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine using physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models [208]. The study found hydroxychloroquine to be more potent than chloroquine in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Based on these models, a hydroxychloroquine loading dose of 400 mg twice daily followed by 200 mg twice daily for 4 days was recommended [208]. A recent systematic review found no published studies in COVID-19 patients [213]. Pending the results of ongoing trials, we were unable to issue a recommendation for or against chloroquine.",

Another systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs on tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis found an increased risk of infectious respiratory adverse events (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.04\u20132.25) [220].
