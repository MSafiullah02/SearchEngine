            "text": "This study reports the results of a systematic screening for respiratory viruses in pediatric outpatients from an emergency department (ED) in southern Brazil during two consecutive influenza seasons. Children eligible for enrollment in this study were aged 24-59 months and presented with acute respiratory symptoms and fever. Naso-and oropharyngeal swabs were collected and multiplex reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to identify the respiratory viruses involved. In total, 492 children were included in this study: 248 in 2010 and 244 in 2011. In 2010, 136 samples (55%) were found to be positive for at least one virus and the most frequently detected viruses were human rhinovirus (HRV) (18%), adenovirus (AdV) (13%), and human coronavirus (CoV) (5%). In 2011, 158 samples (65%) were found to be positive for at least one virus, and the most frequently detected were HRV (29%), AdV (12%), and enterovirus (9%). Further, the presence of asthma (OR, 3.17; 95% CI, 1.86-5.46) was independently associated with HRV infection, whereas fever was associated with AdV (OR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.31-16.52) and influenza infections (OR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.26-16.06). Ten patients (2%) were diagnosed with pneumonia, and six of these tested positive for viral infection (4 HRV, 1 RSV, and 1 AdV). Thus, this study identified the most common respiratory viruses found in preschool children in the study region and demonstrated their high frequency, highlighting the need for improved data collection, and case management in order to stimulate preventive measures against these infections.",

[Izurieta et al., 2000; Fiore et al., 2009; Bezerra et al., 2011; Gessner et al., 2011; Munywoki et al., 2011] . However, information about the etiology of viral ARIs in preschool children, particularly in outpatients, is limited, especially in Latin America. Community respiratory viruses (CRVs) are frequently found in this population and could be involved in severe infections in young children and patients with comorbid conditions [Ampofo et al., 2006; Ampofo et al., 2008; Bender et al., 2009] . Therefore, understanding the dynamics of their circulation among various age groups is essential, not only to help pediatricians in their diagnosis but also for developing preventive measures against these infections.",

Descriptive statistics were used to describe the general characteristics of the study population. Quantitative variables with normal and non-normal distributions are presented as means AE standard deviation and medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs, 25th-75th percentiles), respectively, whereas qualitative variables have been expressed as numbers and percentages with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Chi-square or Fisher's test were used for comparison of qualitative variables. The Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U-test was applied to compare quantitative variables, as appropriate. Five viruses (HRV, AdV, PIV, FLU, and CoV) were selected for a binomial analysis to assess the impact of viruses on the health of the children. The presence or absence of the virus was compared with different variables (demographic, clinical features, and host characteristics). The selection of these viruses was based on either the high frequency of infections or previously reported severity of infections caused by them. Only cases with mono-detection were included in this evaluation. Variables with an associated P-value < 0.2 in the univariate analysis were subjected to multivariate logistic regression to identify independent predictors of these viruses infection. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated. All P-values were based on two-tailed comparisons, and the level of significance was set at P < 0.05.",

Human rhinovirus and adenovirus were the main viruses found in the 2 years following the pandemic. The profile of detected viruses was different from that previous reported, and viruses such as RSV were less frequent, while adenoviruses, which are generally associated with severe infections in hospitalized patients, were more frequently detected. This is probably due to differences in age groups, because previous studies with pediatric outpatients under 2 years old showed a pathogen profile similar to that of hospitalized children [Milstone et al., 2012; Hara et al, 2014; Adams et al., 2015] . S CiS cek et al. [2015] studied respiratory viruses in adult and pediatric patients in a 12-year follow-up study. Similar to our results, in pediatric patients, they found that HRV was detected more frequently in outpatients, and RSV, in inpatients; however, the distribution of the detected viruses was not stratified according to age group. Moreover, diagnosis was based on antigen detection and virus isolation, which are less sensitive than the method used in this study. Likewise, Zimmerman et al. [2015] re-] reported a higher frequency of RSV and influenza A viruses in outpatients, although they were between 6 months and 17 years of age, unlike the group assessed in this study.",

Several factors contributed to the low influenza A H1N1pdm09 circulation in 2010 and 2011. First, vaccination coverage rates were high owing to the public immunization campaigns in 2010 and 2011: vaccination coverage in the studied age group in the city of Curitiba was almost 100% [Brazilian Health Ministry, 2011] . In addition, because of the magnitude of the 2009 pandemic in southern Brazil, the population can be considered sensitized during the study period. Second, the early use of oseltamivir might be a contributing factor. Third, a high rate of influenza A H1N1pdm09 infection was observed in 2010 [Libster et al., 2010] , which might have led to a protective effect in many children during the subsequent season.",

For this reason, we selected five RVs that are often detected in ARIs and used logistic regression to evaluate correlations between their prevalence and various parameters. An association was observed between HRV and asthma, and between the presence of fever and hAdV and influenza infections. Similarly, previous reports have linked HRV to atopic characteristics, and the susceptibility to HRV-induced wheezing has been recognized as an important risk factor for childhood asthma [Tregoning and Schwarze, 2010; Mackay et al., 2013; Turunen et al., 2014] . The strongest association was observed between fever and adenovirus and influenza infections, suggesting that screening for influenza by rapid tests would be recommended. As previously reported, children maintain the chain of transmission of influenza since they shed viruses for a more prolonged time and in higher concentrations; thus, control of these infections must be based on disease control in pediatric patients [Ploin et al., 2007; D'onise and Raupach, 2008; Fiore et al., 2009] .",

            "text": "This study had some limitations: (i) the difference in the number of viruses detected by the multiplex RT-PCR kits used in the 2 years may have influenced the detected virus profile, although no significant difference was found in the positivity rates; and (ii) the predefined sampling period, made it impossible to assess the seasonality of the infections, although this information is already available for the studied region. Despite the advances in the establishment of a wide network of information on the circulation of influenza viruses, little is known about vaccination coverage as well as the impact of CRVs in preschool children. Our findings provide novel insights into the epidemiology and clinical impact of respiratory viruses on pediatric health and highlight the need for implementation of surveillance programs for respiratory viral infections, seeking to stimulate vaccination and to guide preventive measures to protect this population.
