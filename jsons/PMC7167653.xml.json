It is the first time to our knowledge that this method has been used to examine factors that might precipitate type 1 diabetes. For the patients in our study, an episode of infectious disease was associated with a transient risk of type 1 diabetes in the subsequent 42 d that was 10 times higher than the risk during periods of no infections. Despite strong evidence by Yoon and others that infectious diseases could trigger type 1 diabetes, there was very little evidence on a population basis that they did cause diabetes. This is one of the strongest evidences that infectious agents precipitated diabetes on a population basis. These findings are unlikely to be accounted for by recall bias or confounding, since the major source of information was medical records and the case\u2010crossover design employed in this study eliminated the effect of confounding by factors that differed among patients.",

It may be argued that people tend to recall more disease events happening immediately before the onset of type 1 diabetes than that occurring longer before. Our study design helped to minimize this bias by using medical records as the major source to collect information on infectious diseases. Records from pediatrician's offices (source 1) provided the information of infectious diseases for 36 patients, supplemented by interviews with the parents (additional 10 patients) and the records from the local Center for Infectious Disease Control and Prevention (additional 2 patients). Furthermore, infectious diseases are relatively rare events and are easily remembered by parents. The data from interviewing the parents serve as a good supplementary part for the overall information, because they can provide information on mild to moderate infections, which may not show up in medical records. Thus, it is unlikely the strong association that we observed may have been attributed to recall bias.",

Both the usual frequency and the control period approach showed that an episode of infectious disease was associated with an elevated transient risk of type 1 diabetes in the subsequent 42 d. However, the precision of relative risk estimators in case\u2010crossover studies varies greatly depending upon the strategy used in control sampling. In the pair\u2010matched control period approach, the 95% CI was 17 times wider than that estimated by the usual frequency approach. This is in part due to the fact that the data from 18 patients, who did not report infectious diseases at either hazard or control period, were excluded from the analysis using the control period approach, whereas all 48 patients were included in the analysis using the usual frequency approach. This suggests that the study efficiency is greatly increased as the length of the control period is increased and more information is provided for each stratum. The benefit of the usual frequency approach is that more subjects and more relevant information can be included in the analyses, and the results are more precise (24). However, it is difficult to control for covariates in either method. Data collected from the control period approach can be analyzed by conditional logistic regression, which is easier to control for various covariates. But the disadvantage is that a portion of the subjects and a portion of the information were excluded from the analyses. Thus, the precision is lower (24, 25).",

            "text": "With regard to the frequency by which type 1 diabetes is triggered by infections, it is important to distinguish absolute risk from relative risk 14, 15, 16). A limitation of case\u2010crossover design used in this study is similar to one in case\u2010control studies, the absolute risk of type 1 diabetes onset cannot be directly estimated from the data. However, an estimate of the baseline risk can be made with the use of other data sources. For example, on the basis of the Chinese type 1 diabetes registry data (18), the baseline risk of type 1 diabetes for a Chinese child aged 0\u201314 is 0.51 per 100 000. Thus, during the 42 d after infections, his/her risk of developing type 1 diabetes would be increased by 10 times, but the absolute risk is still as low as 5.1 per 100 000. The large relative risk suggested a major role of infections in precipitation of type 1 diabetes. Despite the large relative risk, only 18% participants reported an infection, which could suggest that infection only acts as one of the precipitating factors of type 1 diabetes. It is also possible that many of the infections were missed due to minimal symptoms or difficulty of recall.",

The second most frequent infection was a cold, with a relative risk of 7.7, which was slightly lower than the overall relative risk for infections in general. One major difference between upper respiratory system infection and the common cold is the etiology. Upper respiratory system infection, including pharyngitis, croup and sinusitis, is usually caused by adenovirus or parainfluenza virus, whereas the major pathogens of the common cold are rhinovirus and coronavirus. Therefore, it is most likely that certain types of virus play a more important role in precipitating type 1 diabetes. Studies indicated that coxsackievirus and rotavirus might accelerate or exacerbate islet autoimmunity (26, 27) and that the timing of infection, rather than its presence or absence, might have etiological implications for the development of type 1 diabetes (26). These findings suggested that we could apply the case\u2010crossover design to investigate the role of specific virus infection in the etiology of type 1 diabetes.",

There is not much difference in the relative risk between boys and girls, whereas children who have early onset diabetes (<10 yrs) and whose diabetes was diagnosed in warm season (May\u2013October) have a higher relative risk of developing type 1 diabetes within 42 d of infection. These results suggested that children who develop diabetes at different ages and seasons may have different precipitating factors. Other researches also indicated that infections might modify the autoimmune process in an age\u2010dependent manner and depending upon the timing and number of exposures (11, 28, 29). Because of the small number of cases exposed to infection, we were unable to evaluate whether the risk of having type 1 diabetes differed among other subsets of patients. For example, we could not verify whether the risk of sustaining an infection\u2010associated type 1 diabetes differs for patients with different ethnic groups, family histories or frequencies of infections.",
