Compared with those of adults, umbilical cord blood (UCB) stem cells produce larger in vitro hematopoietic colonies, and can be expanded in long-term culture in vitro. The properties of UCB cells should theoretically compensate for the relatively low numbers of cells contained in a single UCB unit, and through rapid expansion reconstitute myeloablated patients with 1\u20132 logs fewer nucleated cells than bone marrow. However, low cell numbers compromise outcome if infused cell doses fall below critical limits [7]. To enhance engraftment, ex vivo expansion of UCB cells has been attempted in several studies with limited success [8]. Recently, the transplantation of two partially HLA-matched UCB units has been attempted in adults with promising engraftment result [9], but this method is at an early stage of development and little is known about the underlying mechanism of double UCBT.",

Matched related or unrelated BM or peripheral blood stem cell donor was not available in all patients. Median age and body weight of patients (43 male and 18 female) were 9 years (1\u201318 years) and 32 kg (9\u201372 kg), respectively. The clinical characteristics of patients are summarized in Table 1. Cord blood units were selected based on molecular typing of 2 digits for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, -B, and -DRB1 loci, and total nucleated cells (TNC) dose. Patients received two units of cord blood that were matched with the recipient and with each other for 4\u20136/6 HLA-A, -B, or -DRB1 loci and TNC with summing numbers in paired units more than 3.0 \u00d7 107/kg at freezing. In the early period of study, patients without appropriate single cord blood unit (TNC<2.0\u00d7107/kg) were received double UCBT, but after promising result of preliminary result [11], all UCBT was done with two units. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to transplantation. The use of human material for scientific purposes in this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital (0603-142-170).\n\n",

This was also concordant with the later data of the Minnesota group in an investigation of a larger cohort of patients [13]. In our previous report, comparison of the infused CFU-GM number of the winner unit versus that of the loser unit in 18 double UCBT revealed that the CFU-GM dose of the winner unit was significantly greater [12]. Although the methods of measuring the CFU-GM were somewhat different between the two centers and the median value skewed to low side as the mean CFU-GM of one center is significantly lower than others, in the present study with a larger number of patients, it was the sole factor affecting the determination of dominance.

In the present study, CMV infection was the number one cause of TRM and was documented in 34 (56%) patients, five of whom died (four pneumonia, one hepatitis). Because ganciclovir is an agent presented in an inconvenient intravenous form and has myelosuppressive activity, raising the possibility of neutropenia and bacterial infection [30], the oral formula of acyclovir with equivalent preventive effect for CMV was used in this study [31]. In our previous analysis, CMV antigenemia was a risk factor for pulmonary complications and acute respiratory distress syndrome in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and we recommended aggressive prophylaxis and treatment of CMV infection [32]. Prophylaxis with oral valganciclovir was proposed to be as safe and effective as intravenous ganciclovir for preventing CMV infection after UCBT, but valganciclovir also has myelosuppressive activity and a significantly higher number of patients required granulocyte colony stimulating factor after engraftment than those treated with acyclovir [33]. Recently, Hanley et al. reported successful in vitro expansion of CMV antigen-specific T cells from UCB T cells with a naive phenotype [34]. Introduction of this kind of functionally active virus-specific T cells will improve the outcomes of UCBT.",

A recent analysis found no significant difference in the risk of serious viral infections, including PTLD, in recipients of unrelated UCB or unmanipulated marrow [35]. However, the incidence of EBV-related complications was reported to be significantly higher in a subset of patients treated with a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen that included ATG, although overall survival was not different [36]. ATG is a known risk factor for EBV infection [37], and more than 75% (46/61) of the patients in our study received ATG, but as we did not perform regular EBV monitoring in the early period of this study, we could not analyze the incidence of EBV. Recently, Heslop proposed that early intervention or even prophylactic administration may be warranted where there is a high risk of developing PTLD, such as a patient who has received potent T cell depleting or suppressing antibodies [38]. We have now introduced preemptive therapy with single dose rituximab for patients who receive ATG showing high EBV DNA levels to prevent EBV-associated PTLD [39, 40].",
