However, with the development of the epidemic, studies in several provinces and cities in China have identified the phenomenon of family aggregation in this outbreak, which accounts for 50 to 80% of all confirmed cases [5]. In this area, 14 cases were confirmed with 10 of whom sharing the same family relationship. Characteristics of the 10 familial clusters were as follows: the initial case, Case A, had a history of Wuhan stay; Case B, C, D, E, F, G, and I were infected during family meals, among which, Case E and F took the same transportation means along with Case A before the onset; Case H and J were infected while living together with Case G; except for Case A, none of the other cases had ever been to the epidemic area, which confirmed that interpersonal transmission does occur with this disease. Droplets containing the virus can deposit on any surface and can be spread by touching, which would contaminate the hands; moreover, the virus might enter the oral cavity, nasal cavity, and eyes when infected hands come in contact with areas containing mucous membranes. The novel coronavirus has been detected on the surfaces of doorknobs, mobile phones, and other objects in the surroundings of confirmed patients in Guangzhou and Shandong provinces, China, thus assuring that the virus can be transmitted by contact [5]. The fifth edition of the Diagnosis and Treatment guideline for SARS-CoV-2 infection published by the National Health Commission has clearly indicated that people are generally susceptible to this virus, and the incubation period is 3\u20137 days, which is consistent with the average 7-day incubation period for the familial cluster cases in our district.",

One study [4] on 41 patients from the early stage of this epidemic outbreak (until January 2) found that 63% patients had lymphocytopenia, whereas all had pneumonia. Zhao [9] et al analyzed the clinical characteristics of 28 patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (from diagnosis date up to February 5) and found the ordinary starting symptoms to be fever and cough (mainly dry cough) as well, in addition to other symptoms like chill, throat irritation, and fatigue. Radiographic tests showed that the lesions occurred in each part of the bilateral lungs; chest CT showed ground-glass shadow, edge fuzzy shadow, and spot or patchy shadow. The aforementioned results were consistent with the clinical manifestations, laboratory examinations, and chest images of the cluster cases in our district.

            "text": "One patient was characterized by diarrhea, with no fever or respiratory symptom, and another case had nausea caused by SARS-CoV-2 involvement in the. gastrointestinal tract, which was observed. with other coronavirus infections such as SARS in 2003. Cheng [12] reported that 10.6% (15/142) of patients with SARS present with symptoms of diarrhea at admission, whereas this occurs in 48.6% (69/142) of patients within 7.6 \u00b1 2.6 days after this; the mechanism might be related to viral replication in the gut. Additionally, one study [13] on 298 young children with febrile urinary tract infection revealed NLR as a practical biomarker capable of predicting acute pyelonephritis; there is also an important association between NLR and bacterial infection such as pneumonia, sepsis, and systemic inflammatory response. Increased NLR outperforms conventional markers, such as WBCs, neutrophil counts, and CRP, as a useful biomarker to detect bacteremia. In this study, the NLR in severe cases was significantly higher than that in ordinary-type cases, indicating that NLR might be related to the severity of COVID-19. NLR is a simple, cheap, and easy parameter of inflammation, because it can be measured in almost all laboratories. This indicator can be used for routine analysis to further explore the role of NLR in predicting the severity of COVID-19. Notably, it can be seen that CRP increased in most patients here, but PCT values were normal for all of these cases. Previous studies [14,15] showed that PCT is normal during virus infection and that the specificity of predicting bacterial infection is higher than that of CRP. Therefore, the routine use of anti-bacterials is not recommended for COVID-19 patients in the absence of PCT elevation.",

Wang [17] analyzed the correlation between changes in lymphocytes in 252 SARS cases and the disease itself and reported that CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cells are significantly diminished in the first week of the disease. The patients\u2019 conditions improved as CD4 T lymphocytes became normal; in contrast, it indicates the deterioration of diseases related to cellular immunity damage. Recently, Guo et al [18] analyzed the clinical data of patients with viral pneumonia and found that the absolute counts of CD3 + T cells, CD3+CD4 + T cells, and CD3+CD8+T cells in the group that died was significantly lower than those in the surviving group, indicating the impairment of cellular immunity as well. In the severe-type in our study, the CD4 count for Case A was 61 cells/uL, for Case G was 180 cells/uL, and for Case I was 348 cells/uL, whereas the CD4 counts were all above 399 cells/uL for other patients, with both ordinary-and mild-types, suggesting decreased cellular immunity at the onset of disease in severe patients.",

Although at present the nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be quantified, it is known that the lower the RT-PCT-CT value during amplification, the higher the virus load in the specimen being examined [23] and vice versa. With recovery of the patient\u2019s condition, the CT values can change from low to high, and therefore, the communicability of the patient as an infectious source also decreases [24]. In this study, the RT-PCR-CT values in three patients with severe-type infection were lower than those in the rest; specifically, in case A, the RT-PCR-CT was 19.19, implicating a high viral load and the strong infectivity of this patient.",
