We included 45 observational studies in our review.7 In 42 of the 45 studies, the risks of RBC transfusion outweighed the benefits and the risk was neutral in two studies, with the benefits outweighing the risks in a subgroup of a single study (elderly patients with an acute myocardial infarction and a HCT <30%). Seventeen of the eighteen studies demonstrated that RBC transfusions were an independent predictor of death; the pooled OR (12 studies) was 1.7 (95% CI 1.4\u20131.9). Twenty-two studies examined the association between RBC transfusion and nosocomial infection; in all these studies, blood transfusion was an independent risk factor for infection. The pooled OR (nine studies) for developing an infectious complications was 1.8 (95% CI 1.5\u20132.2). RBC transfusions similarly increased the risk of developing MODS (three studies) and ARDS (six studies). The pooled OR for developing ARDS was 2.5 (95% CI 1.6\u20133.3). These data suggest that blood can no longer be regarded as \u201cbeing safe,\u201d that blood transfusions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and that the risks and possible benefits of blood transfusion should be evaluated carefully in each patient prior to a transfusion.",

It is usually caused by anti-leukocyte antibodies, resolves rapidly, and has a low mortality. A single unit of packed cells or blood component products (FFP and platelets) is usually implicated in initiating this syndrome. It has, however, recently been recognized that the transfusion of blood products in critically ill or injured patients increases the risk for the development of the ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 6\u201372 h after the transfusion. This \u201cdelayed TRALI syndrome\u201d is common, occurring in up to 25% of critically ill patients receiving a blood transfusion, and is associated with a mortality rate of up to 40%.8 While the delayed TRALI syndrome can develop after the transfusion of a single unit, the risk increases as the number of transfused blood products increases. The management of both the classic and delayed TRALI syndromes is essentially supportive.",

An isolated decrease in hemoglobin concentration to 10 g/dl with all other parameters remaining constant will result in an oxygen delivery that remains approximately twice that of the resting oxygen consumption. Humans have a remarkable ability to adapt to anemia by increasing cardiac output (in the absence of volume depletion), increasing microcirculatory density, increasing red cell synthesis of 2,3-DPG with a resultant rightward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (aids oxygen unloading), and by increasing oxygen extraction. Healthy volunteers can tolerate isovolemic hemodilution down to a hemoglobin content of 4.5 without apparent harmful effects.9 However, due to the high extraction ratio of oxygen in the coronary circulation, coronary blood flow appears to be the major factor which limits the tolerance of low hemoglobin concentrations. In experimental animal models of coronary stenosis, depressed cardiac function occurs at hemoglobin concentrations between 7 and 10 g/l.10, 11\n",

Rao and colleagues19 examined the potential impact of red blood cell transfusion in 24,111 patients with ACS. Blood transfusion was an independent predictor of myocardial infarction and 30-day all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 3.94). Furthermore, the 30-day mortality was significantly increased when transfusions were given to patients with hematocrits of 25% or above (compared to those with a hematocrit below 25%). Similarly, Aronson and colleagues20 demonstrated an increase in mortality and the composite end point of death/recurrent MI/heart failure in patients with acute myocardial infarction who had a hemoglobin >8 g/dl and received a blood transfusion. Similar observations have been made by other authors.21\u201323 The increased risk of infarction and death is probably related to the pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory properties of stored blood.24\n",

In those patients without cardiovascular disease and who had a baseline hemoglobin of between 6 and 6.9 g/dl, there was no significant increase in perioperative mortality (OR 1.4; 95% CI 0.5\u20134.2) if the blood loss was less than 2.0 g/dl. However, in patients with cardiovascular disease, preoperative anemia was associated with a significant increase in perioperative mortality. These data confirm that humans can adapt to very low hemoglobin levels, with cardiovascular disease being the major limiting factor. These data suggest that in patients undergoing surgery who have significant coronary artery disease, the hemoglobin should be increased to about 10 g/dl prior to surgery. This is best achieved with the use of EPO and iron, thereby avoiding a blood transfusion. Blood transfusions are independent risk factors for perioperative infections, ARDS, and death (and perhaps tumor recurrence).7, 27\n",
