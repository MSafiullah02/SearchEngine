            "text": "\nMECP2 duplication on chromosome Xq28 (#300260) causes a severe form of X-linked intellectual disability (XLID). It was first clinically described as Lubs syndrome, the underlying genetic condition was identified in 2005 [1\u20133]. Up to now more than 200 patients have been described [1\u201350]. The exact prevalence of MECP2 duplication syndrome is still unknown, but in synopsis of different screening attempts it is estimated that MECP2 duplication syndrome may explain ~1 % of cases of severe XLID [51]. The core phenotype of MECP2 duplication syndrome includes infantile hypotonia, mild dysmorphic features, developmental delay/severe to profound intellectual disabilty and absent to minimal speech [51]. Spasticity, ataxia and autism are facultative clinical signs that occur in different combinations and to different degrees. Since the description of the first individuals it became evident that besides the striking neurological phenotype patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome are at increased risk for severe infections. About 70\u201375 % of the affected individuals are reported to develop recurrent infections, especially of the respiratory tract. Respiratory infections are the main cause of early death reported among the population [51, 52]. However a detailed description of the infectious phenotype and an investigation of the immunological phenotype based on a large cohort has been missing to date.",

Samples from the patients were used in this study with approval from the local ethics committee of the Charit\u00e9 (approval # EA2/063/12). All patients enrolled in this study show a genetically confirmed duplication of at least MECP2 and IRAK1. The diagnostics were performed prior to this study and the results were submitted to us by the performing laboratories or geneticists. In patients P1, P2, P8, P9, P10, P11, P12, P13, P14, P17, P19, P20, P21, P25, P27, P28, P29 and P30 the duplication had been detected by use of array-CGH thus revealing the actual size of the duplication on Xq28. In Patient P15 quantitative PCR had been performed and in patients P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P18, P23, P24 and P26 Multiplex-ligation probe amplification was used for the diagnosis of MECP2 duplication and single neighbouring genes, e.g., IRAK1. So in patients P15, P3, P4, P5, P6, P7 and P18, P23, P24 and P26 the actual size of the duplication is unknown. The following patients have been described previously: P1, P2 in Bartsch et al. [21], P3, P4, P5, P6, P7 in Echenne et al. [18], P8 in Budisteanu et al. [31], P9 in Jezela-Stanek et al. [28], P10 in Mayo et al. [32], P12 in Grasshoff et al. [30], P13 in Bauters et al. [9], P15 in Meins et al. [2], P17 in Madrigal et al. [8], P20, P21 in Xu et al. [43], and P22, P27 in Vignoli et al. [40]. For detailed molecular analyses of these patients see the corresponding publications. Patients P11, P14, P16, P18, P19, P23, P24, P25, P26, P28, P29 and P30 have not been published before. For molecular characterization of these patients see supplementary table 1.",

One of the four patients with IgA/IgG2-deficiency had globalized low levels also for IgG, IgG1, IgG3, IgG4 and IgM. Additionally IgG2 was in low normal range in 3 further patients. IgG4 was below reference values in 4 patients, all of which also had IgG2-deficiency.

Of the 21 patients in whom we assessed the levels of S.pneumoniae IgG2-antibodies, 8 patients had received vaccination against pneumococci, 8 patients had not received vaccination and in five patients information on vaccination status was not available. Interestingly S.pneumoniae IgG2-antibodies were low even in the patients with vaccination against pneumococci (Fig. 5). Both pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have been used in the 8 patients with pneumococcal vaccination and 7 of the 8 patients have received several pneumococcal vaccinations. The period between last vaccination and assessment of aPCP-IgG2 ranged from 1 month up to 7 years and 6 month. It is noteworthy that even in the patient with the short interval of 1 month between last vaccination and ascertainment of antibody titers no appropriate antibody production against S. pneumoniae was determined after three vaccinations (Table 2). In contrast to this rather common impairement of IgG2 formation against pneumococci IgG-antibodies against Tetanus-Toxoid were below age-dependent reference values in only 2/21 patients and low in normal range in 2 further patients, so normal in 19/21 patients (supplementary figure 2). In summary 6/21 patients show IgG2-deficiency \u2013 four of them with an additional IgA-deficiency - and half of the patients (10/21) show antibodies against pneumococci either below normal range or in the low range of normal.\n\n\n",

We here describe for the first time, systematically the infectious and immunological phenotype of MECP2 duplication syndrome based on data derived from a standardized study-questionnaire filled out by the physicians together with the parents of 30 patients. Our findings show that patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome are at an increased risk for infections by bacteria that are able to build capsules (61.9 % of isolated pathogens); in particular for infections by S.pneumoniae and H.influenzae. In our cohort we have not observed increased susceptibility to mycobacteria, pneumocystis spp, fungi and viruses. We could not identify a correlation between the size of the duplication (genotype) and the infectious or immunological phenotype. The predominance of respiratory and severe invasive infections caused by bacteria that are able to build capsules, suggested an impairment of humoral immunology.",

IgG2-deficiency in the 6/21 patients and low antibody titers against pneumococci in 10/21 patients suggest that among patients with MECP2 duplication humoral impairement is more common than in the normal population. 5/6 patients with IgG2-deficiency also developed severe infections. As 3/4 individuals with combined IgA/IgG2-deficiency additionally suffered from a very high frequency of infections and developed the most severe infectious phenotype in our cohort there seems at least an association of IgA-/IgG2-deficiency with severe infections. In line with this hypothesis only 2/15 patients without IgA or IgG2 deficiency developed recurrent severe infections comparable to the phenotype observed in the patients with IgA/IgG2-deficiency. One of them showed low IgG2-antibodies against pneumococci even after vaccination indicating an inability to mount an appropriate antibody production although global levels of immunoglobulins are normal in this patient. The other patient (P9) with a severe infectious phenotype despite having an IgA-/IgG2-deficiency showed massively elevated IgG (32 g/l). Given the fact that this patient has a persistently raised leucocyte count, it seems plausible that he additionally suffers from an unknown chronic inflammatory process. 7 of the 15 patients without IgA or IgG2 deficiency developed few infections and 2 of the 15 patients developed no infections. In 4 of the 15 patients without IgA or IgG2 deficiency the severity of the infectious phenotype could not be assessed as the patient was either still at young age or because the history could not be completed appropriately. The single patient who has to date not developed severe infections despite IgA/IgG2-deficiency is female. So in MECP2 duplication syndrome not all patients develop humoral immunodeficiency but severe infections with potentially encapsulated bacteria are, at least in male patients, strongly associated with a lack of IgA and IgG2.",

This observation raises the question if the genetic alterations in patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome lead to a hyper-inflammatory immune response. Because all patients show a duplication on Xq28 that includes MECP2 and neighbouring IRAK1 and given the fact that these two genes were assumed to be the minimal critical region leading to the phenotype of MECP2 duplication syndrome until recently [15, 17, 51], it seems plausible to hypothesize a role of IRAK1 in the pathogenesis of strong acute-phase responses. IRAK1 encodes for a protein in the TLR/IL1R-signalling pathway and it could be assumed that its overexpression leads to stronger or constantly triggered NF\u03baB-mediated pro-inflammatory signalling and to a hyper-inflammatory immune response. In our opinion recently published results suggesting normal TLR-mediated signalling in PBMCs of patients with MECP2/IRAK1 duplication do not sufficiently falsify this hypothesis as these experiments were performed in PBMCs (without granulocytes) and as it remains unclear whether LPS-stimulation was performed with or without serum [44]. So it seems at least possible that the previously described similar production of cytokines upon activation with TLR-agonists in patients and controls in these experiments is due to the insufficient stimulation of cells or a lack of stimulation of granulocytes or both. So to date it remains an open question whether the duplication of IRAK1 renders patients with MECP2 duplication prone to strong inflammatory responses.",

            "text": "It has been published that MECP2 duplication causes a lack of TH1-differentiation, elevated levels of CD4+CD45RA+ na\u00efve/ lowered levels of CD4+CD45R0+ memory T-cells and impaired IFN\u03b3-secretion by T-cells in mice and in patients with MECP2 duplication. It was concluded that this lack of TH1 differentiation/ IFN\u03b3-secretion is the major cause for the increased susceptibility for infections in patients with MECP2 duplication [44]. These observations are partially in line with ours. Also in our cohort 5/14 patients showed elevated levels of CD4+CD45RA+ na\u00efve/ lowered levels of CD4+CD45R0+ memory T-cells. The observed ratio of CD4+CD45RA na\u00efve versus CD4+CD45R0+ memory T-cells in our cohort is >1 in 11/14 patients and < 1 in 3/14 patients. However our data do not fully confirm the hypothesis of an impaired IFN\u03b3-secretion as sufficient explanation for the increased susceptibility to infections: 1. Upon ConA-stimulation we observed a normal IFN\u03b3-production in 5/7 patients, an even stronger IFN\u03b3-production in one patient and only a slightly impaired IFN\u03b3-production in one patient compared to healthy controls (Fig. 3); 2. If the observed reduction of IFN\u03b3-secretion in patients with MECP2 duplication was causative for severe infections one would expect disseminated and/or invasive infections with atypical mycobacteria and S.enteritidis as described for molecular precisely\u2013defined partial and complete defects in at least 9 genes leading to the impairment of IFN\u03b3-receptor signalling or IFN\u03b3-secretion [71\u201374]; 3. Conversely during a total of 343 patient years in our study only one patient (P9) developed a single, non-complicated infection by M.tuberculosis, which remained restricted to the lung and was successfully treated by standard therapy. In a patient with a strongly relevant impairement of IFN\u03b3-secretion an infection with M.tuberculosis would have taken a severe course [71\u201374]. Interestingly however 13/21 patients developed either supra-normal values of IgG1 of IgG3 or of both, IgG1 and IgG3. This observation suggests a direct or indirect effect of MECP2 duplication on the expression of IgG3 and IgG1 at the \u03b33/\u03b31 locus and of IgA, IgG2 and IgG4 at the \u03b11/\u03b32/\u03b34 locus. It has been shown that IFNy stimulates the expression of the IgG2a-isotype and inhibits the production of IgG3, IgG1, IgG2b and IgE in mice [75]. So a deficiency in IFNy-secretion may lead to alterations of immunoglobulin levels in humans with MECP2 duplication although the role of IFNy in the regulation of IgG3 is controversial [76, 77]. We did not observe a generally impaired IFNy secretion in our cohort. However previously published results on irregularities in IFNy secretion should be taken into account as being responsible for altered immunoglobulin levels in patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome [44].",

Based on our observation we hypothesize a multifactorial pathogenesis of infections in patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome: Pulmonary infections may be triggered by frequent aspirations due to the severe neurological phenotype and favoured due to humoral immunodeficiency. The observed alterations in the IgG subclass composition (high IgG1/IgG3 and low IgA/IgG2/IgG4) may be caused directly by interaction of MECP2 with the respective loci or indirectly by spatially impaired IFN\u03b3-secretion. An increased susceptibility to hyper-inflammation either caused by IRAK1 duplication or other direct or indirect effects of MECP2 duplication may aggravate infections. Based on the compiled immunological and infectious findings we recommend to vaccinate patients with MECP2 duplication against pneumococci and to evaluate post-vaccination titers. If post-vaccination titers are not sufficient, several boosts might be required. In patients with MECP2 duplication syndrome, suffering from recurrent infections and with an IgG2-subclass deficiency and/or low post-vaccination titers against pneumococci prophylactic substitution of IgG seems a plausible strategy to prevent infections \u2013 eventually in combination with the use of prophylactic antibiotics.",
