Such huge change ended by establishing clinical pharmacy practice during the period of 1960s and 1970s and led later on to founding pharmaceutical care (Elenbaas & Worthen, 2009). The new trend of practice, which was started early in the United States and transferred to other countries, represents a way of practice dominating worldwide. Since then, pharmacists became the main source of information on medicines and gained the appreciation and respect of the healthcare team members everywhere in the world. Information on medicines is provided by individual pharmacists during medical rounds and scientific meetings such as conferences, workshops, and seminars or within official bodies such as medicines information centers and hospital committees. Trust and appreciation extended to the general public because of pharmacists\u2019 contribution to the awareness campaigns, patients counseling, pharmacists-run clinics, and participation in wellness programs.",

Published research papers are called primary literature because they are the primary source of newly discovered and recently revealed information that is established from research and investigations before such information becomes well known and later on all other sources of information are built based on them. Previously, all journals are published as printed material. Nowadays, journals are published as print and as online digital copies, and some journals are online-only. This has increased accessibility of the journal materials to the readers. In terms of accessibility, journals are either subscription based (i.e., users\u2019 payments) or freely accessed (i.e., publication fees are paid by the individual researchers or their institutions). When we describe the availability of biomedical journals in a particular institution, we mean their availability within the library databases of that institution, which requires the subscription of such institution with the database that includes the required journals. If a journal is available free to the readers, then there is no problem with accessibility to its content and the content can be downloaded and easily used by anyone. However, with subscription-only journals\u2019 content, there may be a problem in the accessibility to such information among pharmacists in the poorest developing countries (i.e., low- to middle-income countries).",

However, a major limitation of textbooks and books is that some included details must be updated from other resources depending on the nature of the information and on how progressive the research in the particular scientific field is. This is like statistics on the epidemiology of a fast-spreading disease. On average, for a book to be written and published, it requires a period ranges from 3 to 5 years. If some references included in a book at the book preparation time were 5 years back, then such information will be about 10 years backdated when the book becomes firstly available in the market. In our rapidly changing world today, 10 years-back information might be totally obsolete. A study conducted by Novo Nordisk Inc. to assess the accuracy of information about Novo Nordisk products in 37 common drug and medical references identified some errors in such references including outdated product information (Lum & Ahn, 2012).",

A survey conducted in Nigeria among practicing pharmacists revealed that text books such as Index of Essential Medicines (Emdex, first published in 1991 as Nigeria\u2019s Essential Drugs (NED) Guide), British National Formulary, and others are among most used sources of medicine information (Udezi, Oparah, & Enyi, 2007). In Jordan, a study conducted by Wazaify, Maani, and Ball (2009) reported that all private community pharmacies had at least one reference book, but most were outdated. In Singapore, reference texts are still trusted by pharmacists (Wong, Ko, & Sklar, 2009). Even in the United States, a survey performed among Alabama pharmacy facilities indicated a high use of textbooks as medicine information resources such as Drug Facts and Comparisons and Physician\u2019s Desk Reference (Schrimsher, Freeman, & Kendrach, 2006). Clauson, Fass, and Seamon (2008a) explored the legal requirements for maintaining medicines information resources in pharmacies across the 50 states in the United States and found that two states, Minnesota and South Dakota (3.8% of states), required print references. The availability of digital copies of textbooks, books, and monographs has increased the availability and the wide usage of such resources since they are portable and they are convenient while used (Hughes, Kendrach, Schrimsher, Wensel, & Freeman, 2011).",

An MIC is a unit or a department having specific physical setting, supported with certain facilities (such as computers and Internet, print and digital library, a telephone line and a fax) and dedicated staff specialized in the area of medicines information services provision. MICs are commonly localized or affiliated to hospitals, academic institutions, Ministries of Health, medicines manufacturers, health professional associations, and community pharmacies. In hospitals, which are the primary setting of MIC, if no center exists, there should be at least a medicines information service provided by pharmacy department, individual clinical pharmacists, or ordinary pharmacists. Sometimes, an MIC serves the poison information needs of its users and it may be referred to as a medicines and poisons information center. In some situations, there is a need for a regional MIC that covers with its services a large region or a state from a country. This is particularly needed in the poorest countries and it should be encouraged to overcome problems of shortage in infrastructures, facilities, funding, qualified personnel, and other resources.",

Such literature represented reporting of the activities undertaken by the centers, rates of medicines information inquiries, classification of requests made, classification of the information users, the satisfaction of the information users, and the impact of the information provided. It is important to notice that some reports presented here are 20 years back since very recent studies are scarce. Also, what is presented here only indicates the availability of the services and describes the pattern of the available reports and does not represent a conclusive listing of the actually available services as some services might be available but not reported.1.A study was conducted in Saudi Arabia to evaluate electronic information resources for questions received by King Saud University College of Pharmacy Medicines Information Centre (Alnaim & Abuelsoud, 2007). The evaluation included time spent to get an answer, ease of use, comprehensiveness, and availability of information in Drugdex, Lexi-Drugs, and the Internet search engine AltaVista. Investigators concluded that Drugdex and Lexi-Drugs are faster, more efficient medicines information databases and all of the three databases were comparable regarding comprehensiveness and availability of information. Using the Internet through the search engine AltaVista, in addition to print drug information resources, appears to be a suitable substitute to Drugdex and Lexi-Drugs when they are not available.2.A study assessed the utilization of MICs located in four public hospitals of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, found that most of the queries made came from the public hospitals (69%) and likely from healthcare professionals (94.9%) (Samuel, Dawit, & Ashenef, 2014). Physicians were ranked first in making queries (49.7%) followed by pharmacists (32.8%). The highest number of questions was categorized under therapeutic use followed by general product information and product availability.3.A telephone interviews were conducted using a semistructured questionnaire to assess the user satisfaction with the services provided by an MIC affiliated with Ministry of Health Khartoum State, Sudan (Fathelrahman, Awang, Bashir, Taha, & Ibrahim, 2008). Most of calls came from within Khartoum State (89.6%). Pharmacists were ranked first in making calls (36.1%), followed by physicians (29.5%) and the public (22.3%). Almost one-fifth, one-half, and one-third of users had made inquiries more than five times, two to five times, and once, respectively. Overall, users reported very high satisfaction with the services received and with the way how the medicines information pharmacists treated them.\n4.Another study from Zimbabwe assessed the utilization of the national drugs and poisons information center in Harare, the capital city (Ball, Tagwireyi, & Maponga, 2007). Most of the requests came from within Harare (67%). Pharmacists were ranked first in making medicines information calls (40%), whereas physicians were ranked first in making toxicology-related calls (49%). Among medicines information inquiries, systemic antiinfective (24%) and nervous system agents (20.4%) predominated. Among toxicological inquiries, pesticides (28%) and pharmaceuticals (21%) predominated.5.A review on records of medicines information inquiries received by the Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia Drug Information Unit was performed (Ab Rahman and Abu Samah, 1998). Among main findings were the quantity and type of questions received and the categories of users remained relatively constant during a period of 6 years. Most of the requests were directly related to patient care and they came within the university hospital. The use of textbooks as sources for answering questions was the most common practice during the first years of the unit start and it became less common during the subsequent years. This was associated with a gradually increased use of MICROMEDEX drug database, which became the most consulted source of information at the end of the studied period.6.A study was performed to identify the characteristics of the medicines information provided by an MIC of a university hospital in Brazil (Silva et al., 2011 available only as an abstract). There was a variation in the rate and nature of the received inquiries and in the categories of requesters during a period of only 2 years.7.An assessment of medicines information services provided by pharmacy practice department in Kasturba Hospital, Manipal, a South Indian teaching hospital, was made (George & Rao, 2005). Evaluation included the nature of queries and the quality of the provided services. The majority of the service users were physicians (82%) and medical postgraduate students (16%). Feedback from users indicated their regular use and their high satisfaction with the services provided.8.After promoting the services of the MIC of Karnataka State Pharmacy Council, India, to healthcare professionals and patients, a dramatic increase in the number of queries received by the center was eminent (Lakshmi, Rao, Gore, & Bhaskaran, 2003). Pediatricians, general physicians, dermatologists, and gynecologists constituted the bulk of the doctors using the center services. Queries received from doctors represented 41.3% after the promotion of the service, while they represented only 13.2% at the beginning. Other requests were from patients, pharmacists, and drug regulatory authorities (Table 22.1\n).\n",

Despite the filtering process of the peer review system undertaken by biomedical journals, still there are various limitations in the published literature. Accumulating evidence indicates that a significant proportion of the studies published in a variety of biomedical journals cannot be trusted regarding validity and accuracy, and there is a need for establishing some critical appraisal skills to differentiate between high-quality and low-quality studies. Developing critical appraisal skills depends mainly on familiarity with research methodology, study designs, and statistics (the scope of the chapter does not allow for further elaboration on such point and an interested reader should consult a specialized reference).",

In the following we are providing snapshots of nice experiences from a variety of countries from the developing world. The purpose of this description is to offer others an opportunity to learn such experiences and replicating them in their own way.1.On April 6, 1998, in recognition for its contribution and services in the field of drug and poison information, the National Poison Centre of Malaysia, which is based in Universiti Sains Malaysia, was designated as a WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Information. The founding of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug Information was meant: (a) To establish, develop and facilitate a system of electronic information exchange among member states of Western Pacific Region (WPR) in particular, and WHO in general. (b) To develop, update and implement training modules on Drug Information in developing countries with emphasis on the needs of the Western Pacific Region. (c) To arrange and conduct fellowship training in drugs as well as poison information in support of the concept of rational drug use. (d) To collaborate with the Western Pacific Regional Office in developing computer applications relating to drug information and pharmacoinformatics. (e) To collaborate with the Western Pacific Regional Office in initiating a systematic data and information collection on activities related to the drug utilization, management and policies for identification of priorities and forecasting of needs. (f) To support countries and areas in the region to conceptualize, plan and set up Drug Information Services tailored to individual needs. (g) To undertake relevant drug utilization studies in support of promoting rational use of medicines, develop focused drug information intervention for providers and consumers to improve prescribing and drug use practices, and to undertake proper evaluation of the impact of drug information on rational use of medicines (Information copied from the website of the National Poison Centre of Malaysia http://www.prn.usm.my/who_collaborating_centre.php accessed December 28, 2016).2.Going beyond medicines information: The drug information center at Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal, founded in November 2003 succeeded in providing activities besides the provision of medicines information services such as running a pharmacovigilance center and a medication counseling center (Shankar, Mishra, Subish, & Upadhyay, 2007). The center resources are used for teaching of the undergraduates and for continuing pharmacy education program of pharmacists. The center publishes a quarterly bulletin and support research activities.3.Between 1983 and 2000, seven public medicines information units have been established in Costa Rica (Hall, Gomez, & Fernandez-Llimos, 2006). Of those, four are MICs and three are medicines information services. The seven MICs and services followed the guidelines established by Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), and the seven units provide almost comparable wide scope types of activities including as examples answering inquiries from user from inside as well as outside hospitals; preparation of technical reports for hospital committees; conducting research about drug use and adverse drug reactions; delivering lectures and seminars; participation in continuing education activities; conducting educational programs for patients and high-risk groups; publication of drug bulletins, papers, and booklets; supporting rotation programs for trained students; and preparation of guides on drug use for healthcare team.4.Information sharing systems: A possible compensation for the lack and the scarcity of information is to establish an information sharing system by constructing a national or a regional medicines information database. The database may contain information needed by all stakeholders in the country or the region similar to the national information sharing system suggested by Muangchoo and Kritchanchai (2015) to serve the healthcare supply chain in Thailand.\n",

            "text": "\n1.Securing enough funding for establishing and running an MIC in the poorest countries represents a great challenge: A developing country with very limited financial resources will not be able to establish and then run an MIC easily. Even if establishment is achieved via donations or other sources, running the center will not be easily achieved without proper solutions. One of the strategies that should be followed is to build up one regional center instead of establishing a couple of centers that grow weak and become unable to survive. Then the limited scarce resources can be saved to strengthen the center and ensure sustainability of its services. One of the possible solutions is to implement a fee-for-service policy. Several Western countries are having an experience in this regard. A survey sent to medicines information centers in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States revealed that 18% of the centers use a fee-for-service system (Ansong, Moody, & Stachnik, 2003). For a developing country, the payers can be the private sector and the industry, which will be willing to pay if their information needs are secured by the medicines information service provider2.The full access to biomedical literature in the poorest countries: The full access to biomedical literature in the poorest countries where basic resources and infrastructures are lacking represents a challenge to the practicing pharmacists in general and to the medicines information specialists in particular. Pharmacists in such countries are advised to seek access to the required medicines information via registering with WHO\u2019s Hinari program.3.Provision of medicines information about off-label use of medicines: \u201cOff-label medicines use\u201d refers to using a medication for an indication or in a dosage form or for a group of patients, which is not indicated when approved by the regulatory authority. It is very common practice worldwide and it may be unavoidable with a rate reaching 15% to 20% in western settings. It is most common among the groups of patients who are not normally included in the clinical trials that are conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the medications. Those groups included pediatric patients, particularly neonates, adolescents, pregnant women, and psychiatric patients. There is a lack of evidence-based information on the efficacy and safety of a particular medication among the stated groups, and possible information available represents an extrapolation of the evidence generated from research conducted among other groups of patients. Manufacturers\u2019 sources of information can be useful in these situations, although such information should be used cautiously.\n4.Provision of medicines and toxicological information during bioterrorism and biologic weapons attacks and other emergencies: An attack with a biologic weapon during a terrorism event or a biologic war is a special medical emergency that requires special readiness with poisoning and toxicology information. In such situation a medicines information pharmacist or an MIC is expected to provide the suitable support to the healthcare team and the attacked victims in a timely and an efficient manner.5.Provision of medicines information during a pandemic: A pandemic is an epidemic of infectious diseases, such as H5N1 avian flu, Zika virus, Ebola virus disease, Rift Valley fever, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, which have spread through human populations across a large geographical areas including multiple continents or even worldwide. During such situations, a medicines information pharmacist or an MIC experiences a rush of high-frequency calls from healthcare providers asking for treatment information, especially at the beginning of an outbreak when healthcare providers are still not fully aware and may be lacking basic information about the disease.\n",

This can be achieved via sharing available experiences and resources and can be maximized by building collaborative regional MICs.4.Institutions from developing countries with no or limited access to high-quality medicines information resources should seek assistance from supportive organizations such as the WHO, which can offer free access to the Hinari database. Other freely available resources should be also sought.5.Medicines information education should be promoted among colleges of pharmacy at various levels including didactic courses during undergraduate studies, during APPE training of PharmD students and as postgraduate studies and training (i.e., residencies, fellowships, and masters programs).6.Training for developing and strengthening the medicines information skills should be provided regularly to all practicing pharmacists as part of the continuing professional development (CPD) programs7.Advanced training can be scheduled for pharmacists working on the provision of medicines information services as part of CPD activities to build their capacities and to raise their competencies.8.Countries with limited experiences in the area of medicines information should work on to learn from countries having well-established systems of medicines information and try to copy successful innovations.9.There is a need to monitor and evaluate various resources of medicines information available in the developing countries as well as evaluating the services provided by the medicines information centers. This is very useful for improvement and for the expansion and the sustainability of the services. Evaluations are done by conducting scientific research studies. Such researches should be published to allow others make use of the established evidence.\n",

The information will be used to build pharmacists own competencies to practice efficiently and ethically and to provide high-quality services. The quality of information can be measured in terms of satisfying certain standard criteria and in terms of satisfying the needs of the information user. Being aware of the information needs of the healthcare professionals is helpful in offering the required assistance that is tailored to the users\u2019 needs. The availability of a medicine information resource does not indicate the usage or the usefulness of such resource. The accessibility and the quality of information are having great effects on the use and the full utilization of such resource. Securing enough funding for establishing and running an MIC in the poorest countries represents a great challenge. Education on medicines information should be well established in the curricula of pharmacy colleges to prepare future pharmacists with the required knowledge and skills needed for good practicing.",
