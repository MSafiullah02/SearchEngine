Information is now being updated constantly and more than 1000 patients with COVID-19 had been reported in Japan by March 2020 [3,4]. Several reports describe patients with COVID-19 pneumonia showing clinical symptoms such as fever, fatigue, or dry cough. In many cases, symptoms are mild. However, several reports point to severe cases which developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and life threatening events [5,6].",
