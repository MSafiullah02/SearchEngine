The two outer primers were described as the forward outer primer (F3) and the backward outer primer (B3). The inner primers were described as the forward inner primer (FIP) and the backward inner primer (BIP). Further, two loop primers, forward loop primer (FLP) and backward loop primer (BLP), were designed to accelerate the amplification reaction. The usefulness of the selected primer set for correctly identifying all strains and isolates of S-OIV was established through sequence alignment of all available HA gene sequences in the GenBank, including the circulating strains responsible for the recent pandemic in India, using DNASIS software (MiraiBio, Yokohama, Japan). In addition, the homology study was used to ensure the maximum number of mismatched nucleotides between pandemic S-OIV sequences and seasonal flu (InfA), including other respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, para influenza, adeno virus, and so forth, so as to avoid cross-amplification. The details of the primer sequences with regard to genome position are depicted in Table 1.",

The serial tenfold dilutions of extracted RNA from the infected culture fluid were analyzed in triplicate. To generate the S-OIV H1 gene-specific RTLAMP standard curve, 188 bp target of the H1 gene was amplified by outer (F3) and backward outer (B3) primers. The amplicon was then purified and cloned using the pC R4-TOPO vector system (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The sequence confirmed that plasmid was linearized using a vector-specific restriction enzyme (NdeI) and then quantified by Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The concentration of the plasmid preparation was determined by measuring the OD at 260 nm. Conversion to genome equivalents was calculated as 1 OD260 equals 50g/ml and one bp equals 660 g/mol, resulting in a molecular weight for the plasmid (4156 bp) of 2.74 \u00d7 106 pg/pmol.

During outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, accurate and rapid diagnosis is critical for minimizing further spread through timely implementation of appropriate vaccines, antiviral treatments, and prophylactic measures.4 A number of different diagnostic laboratory tests can be used for detecting the presence of influenza viruses in respiratory specimens, including direct antigen-detection tests, virus isolation in cell culture, and detection of influenza-specific RNA by real-time RTPCR. These tests differ in their sensitivity and specificity in detecting influenza viruses. The confirmatory and reliable early laboratory diagnosis of S-OIV is currently based on a WHO-approved, CDC-recommended, real-time RT-PCR\u2013based detection method followed by either isolation of the novel H1N1 influenza virus or detection of a fourfold rise of neutralization antibodies to this virus.",

Real-time is more rapid and sensitive than traditional techniques, including virus isolation by cell culture. Various investigators have reported several formats for real-time RTPCR, but none of those assays were validated by a defined sample panel. Therefore, the WHO approved only the CDC-recommended real-time RTPCR assay for confirmation of infection by pandemic S-OIV H1N1 influenza. However, the existing WHO-approved, CDC real-time RTPCR system has several limitations, including the high cost because of the use of large number of primer and probe sets. One of the major limitations of the WHO-approved, CDC real-time RTPCR is the requirement of an expensive real-time PCR instrument that can be afforded only by referral laboratories with good financial resources. Still another limitation of the real-time RTPCR test system is that it is time consuming, requiring 3 to 4 hours. In addition, the limitation of all PCR methods is that false-negative results may occur because of sequence variations in primer and probe targets, and that is particularly relevant for the detection of emerging viruses. However, the use of multiple targets can reduce such limitations and may serve as a means of confirming positive results.",

This is an alternative real-time test system for rapid detection and for identification of novel S-OIV H1N1 viruses. The assay is based on a simple isothermal gene-amplification tool using a specially designed primer set that specifically amplifies the H1 gene of novel S-OIV only. Unlike PCRs, in which the target gene is flanked by two primers, in the case of LAMP, a set of six primers flanks a small target of approximately 200 bp through recognition of eight different sequences of the target gene. LAMP is therefore selective and target specific. Unless all of the eight different sequences are identified, the amplification will not proceed.17 Therefore, a sequence homology of 95% or higher is required for LAMP. The in-silico specificity testing of S-OIV H1 RTLAMP primer set revealed more than 98% to 99% homology among the circulating S-OINV strains, including the California/Paris/China/Singapore/Indian strains. However, the homology between S-OIV and InfA strains in swine H1N1 strains was below 90%. Further analysis of other respiratory viruses, such as respiratory synctial, adeno, para influenza, and so forth revealed less than 50% homology. The in-silco analysis of the S-OIV H1 RTLAMP primer set clearly indicates that the designed primer set is highly specific for the S-OIV H1N1 virus strain only.",

            "text": "The comparative evaluation of CDC real-time RTPCR that includes a reasonably good number of samples revealed 100% concordance for picking up positive cases. Overall, S-OIV RTLAMP picked up some additional positive cases that were being missed by WHO-CDC real-time RTPCR and that were found to be true-positives following sequencing. The presence of the discrepant-additional positive samples is attributed to the higher sensitivity of S-OIV RTLAMP, as already indicated through comparative analytical sensitivity tests for limit of detection. The lower sensitivity of WHO-CDC real-time RTPCR has been reported by Ellis et al.16 in 2009 in their comparative study that evaluated various H1N1 primer and probe sets. These discrepant additional positive samples were further confirmed as true positives by using SYBR Green I-based real-time RTPCR as the third test, and nucleotide sequencing is considered a polished gold standard.26 The higher sensitivity and specificity of the reaction is attributed to the continuous amplification under isothermal conditions and the use of six primers that recognize eight distinct regions of the target.19 The reproducibility and versatility of the reported S-OIV H1 gene-specific RTLAMP is indicated by the fact that the evaluation is being carried out at three centers and by at least 10 different investigators over a period of three months, using four to five lots of reagents. The quantification of the virus load by the RTLAMP assay can also be a useful marker to assess the therapeutic efficacy of antiviral drug as well as for the quarantine of patients so as to restrict the spread of infection. As indicated by the results, the S-OIV H1 RTLAMP could pick up the borderline cases in which the virus load was in the range of 10 to 1 copy numbers. The fact that most of the patients may have either a high or a low virus load, depicting bimodal distribution, may be attributed to late reporting in most cases because all three of the testing centers are being designated referral laboratories for H1N1 testing.",

The assay is rapid and cost-effective because gene amplification can be accomplished in a heating block/water bath and followed by the naked eye as it monitors the visual fluorescence in the form of color change. These simple attributes of the assay make it favorable for adoption as a field gene-amplification technology without requiring any expensive instruments. The method is simple and obviates the need for expensive equipment such as real-time PCR instruments, which cost $40,000 to $50,000. The better appreciation of apple-green fluorescence can be achieved by using a simple UV hand-held torch. The test is rapid; results can be obtained in 60 minutes as compared to the 3 to 4 hours required by conventional gene amplification assays. The method is highly sensitive and specific and can detect low copy number of viruses, especially in the borderline cases that would be missed by conventional RT-PCR techniques. These findings suggest that the S-OIV H1 gene-specific RTLAMP assay is a valuable tool for rapid, real-time detection as well as for quantification of the H1N1 virus in acute-phase throat-swab samples. It requires no sophisticated equipment, so it is useful for clinical diagnosis in developing countries.",
