Whereas methods for studying faecal microbiome DNA are plentiful, there is a lack of well-characterised procedures for stabilisation, isolation, and quantitative analysis of faecal host DNA. We report an optimised pipeline for faecal host DNA analysis from the point-of-collection to droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) absolute quantification of host-specific gene targets. We evaluated multiple methods for preservation and isolation of host DNA from stool to identify the highest performing methods. To quantify host DNA even if present in partially degraded form, we developed sensitive, human-specific short-amplicon ddPCR assays targeting repetitive nuclear genomic elements (LINE-1) and mitochondrial genes. We validated the ability of these optimised methods to perform absolute quantification of host DNA in 200 stool DNA extracts from samples that were serially collected from three healthy individuals and three hospitalised patients. These specimens allowed assessment of host DNA day-to-day variability in stool specimens with widely varying physical characteristics (i.e., Bristol scores). We further extended this approach to mouse stool analysis, to enable faecal host DNA studies in animal disease models as well.",

Therefore, when selecting human gene targets and designing ddPCR primers for our assays, we considered: i) the gene targets should ideally exist as a large number of copies per cell for enhanced sensitivity; ii) the primers need to be highly specific for human DNA relative to microbial, plant, or animal genomes that may be present in stool; and iii) the amplicons need to be as short as possible to allow for efficient capture of even partially degraded DNA. Therefore, we focused on two types of targets that are present at multiple copies per cell: repetitive sequences in the nuclear genome and mitochondrial genes. Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), including LINE-1 repeats, are transposable elements that comprise 17% of the human genome 18 . LINE-1 repeats in plasma have been used to quantify the human tumour xenograft load in mice 19 . We postulated that the extremely high copies per genome of LINE-1 elements would substantially increase the likelihood of detecting human DNA using these targets, even in a high background of microbial and dietary DNA.",

We therefore selected two LINE-1 sequences, 55-bp and 60-bp long, respectively, as well as two mitochondrial gene sequences, 83-bp (located in the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 gene, abbreviated as ND5) and 77-bp (located in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II gene, abbreviated as CO2) long, respectively, as targets for initial ddPCR assay development.",

For the LINE-1 primer sets, we observed decreasing amplification as annealing/extension temperatures were increased from 53 to 61 \u00b0C (Fig. 1a) . We selected 60 \u00b0C as a conservative temperature to minimize false positive signals. For the mt primers, on the other hand, absolute copy number (ACN) quantifications remained relatively constant between 53 -61 \u00b0C (Fig. 1a) . We decided to use the same annealing/extension temperature of 60 \u00b0C for ddPCR for both primer sets so these two assays can be run together on the same plate. At 60 \u00b0C, LINE-1 assays yielded 6-20 times higher ACN than mt assays, with the LINE-1 60bp amplicon demonstrating the highest ACN of all (Fig. 1a) , suggesting that LINE-1 assays may be more sensitive for low DNA input samples than the mt assays.",

For each non-human genome, we determined a signal to noise (S/N) ratio calculated as ACN measured in human stool DNA divided by ACN measured from the non-human gDNA. As shown in Fig. 1b , for LINE-1 assays, aside from monkey gDNA (where cross-reactivity was expected given sequence conservation), the assays showed human-specificity in excess of 100-fold across most genomes, and even the lowest S/N ratio, seen with one of the assays on corn gDNA, showed in excess of 25-fold specificity for human gDNA. The mitochondrial DNA assays were even more human-specific, yielding S/N ratios of >100 in all cases and >1000 for some of the non-human genomes (Fig. 1b) . Whereas the mtDNA assays show higher specificity, the LINE-1 assays may be more sensitive, because of the potentially higher number of copies per cell of LINE-1 DNA targets.

Two sets of primers targeting LINE-1 elements in the mouse genome (mLINE-1) were designed. These mLINE-1 primers target 58-bp and 62-bp amplicons, respectively. We used 0.2 pg HaeIII-digested purified mouse gDNA as templates in a gradient PCR experiment to determine the optimal annealing and extension temperatures for the primers. Similar to the human LINE-1 primers, the mLINE-1 primers showed inverse relationships between copy number yields and annealing and extension temperatures (Supplementary Fig. S3a ). To minimise non-specific amplification and ensure proper primer-template annealing, we chose 59 \u00b0C for annealing and extension during ddPCR, a temperature at which both primer sets exhibit high copy number yields (~10,000 copies/GE for the 58-bp amplicon and ~16,300/GE for the 62-bp amplicon).",

All of these factors could collectively alter host DNA content and accessibility for analysis in the stool. To determine whether our optimised methods could be used to measure host DNA levels in stool from hospitalised patients, we used our methods to quantify human DNA in three allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) patients (P07, P12, and P13) from duplicate DNA isolations at multiple times during the first 100 days after transplant (69 samples and 138 DNA isolations total). These patients represent a sick population since they all received radiation and/or chemotherapy before transplantation, which generally cause organ and tissue damage, especially in the GI tract. Two of the three HCT patients (P07 and P12) also developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in the GI tract and experienced moderate to severe diarrhoea during periods of hospitalisation. Thus collectively across the stool specimens, we were able to cover almost the entire range of the Bristol Stool Scale (types 2-7) with respect to stool consistency.",

For sample collection, we identified 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8) for use as a host DNA preservative solution for stool samples, which can stabilize DNA in stool for at least 4 days at room temperature. Since EDTA is nontoxic, readily available and relatively inexpensive, it offers an economical solution for stool DNA preservation at the point of collection, until DNA isolation can be carried out. It is worth noting that our DNA stability analyses were carried out using stool that had been homogenized within an hour of collection, in order to produce material that could be uniformly sampled over multiple time points. In real-world practice, we expect that stools would be collected in EDTA without prompt homogenization. Thus a limitation of our study is that we do not know whether such delays in homogenization would impact the DNA stabilisation effect of EDTA. Additionally, we found glass beads facilitated homogenisation of stool in a relative large volume of solution (i.e. 40 ml) and therefore recommend having them in the stool collectors.",

The choice of ddPCR as an analytic approach has advantages over real time PCR in this setting. These include obtaining absolute quantification without a standard curve, higher precision 13 , and less sensitivity to PCR inhibitors 36 , which may be present in stool and co-purify with stool DNA 12 . In addition, we chose targets that are present in high copy numbers per cell, and validated low cross-reactivity against other genomes that may be expected in stool.

However due to low DNA concentration in our patient specimens, we did not perform DNA fragmentation, as incorporating fragmentation may lead to sample loss and/or dilution. Therefore we expect the detection limit to be even lower for the LINE-1 assay for samples that have higher DNA concentrations and are hence suitable for pre-ddPCR DNA fragmentation. When reporting faecal host DNA levels, we found that normalisation of ACN to stool input (wet weight) did not visibly alter the longitudinal trends within an individual, regardless of the individual's physiological status (healthy vs. hospitalised) and stool consistency (Bristol scores 2 through 7). We infer that this result indicates that the biological variability is much greater than the variability introduced by not normalising to stool weight. However stool wet weight has the limitation that it can be confounded by variations in water content. In future studies, it would be worthwhile to assess whether normalisation to stool dry weight (which was not available for our specimens) could better account for variations in stool input, especially for watery stools that may contain very little organic material.",

In the 31 serially collected stool specimens from three healthy donors, the LINE-1 elements ranged from 5,600,000 to 184,000,000 copies per ~200 \u03bc l stool homogenate and 52,000 to 4,050,000 copies per mg of stool collected. Based on the empirically measured number of LINE-1 elements per haploid genome in a commercially available reference human genomic DNA sample, we were able to estimate that these values correspond to approximately 2 to 176 cells per mg of stool collected from the healthy donors. We consider these to be only estimates because the number of copies of LINE-1 per genome is polymorphic in the human population. Thus, there could be differences in the number of LINE-1 copies per genome in the individuals whose stool samples we studied, as compared to the reference human genomic DNA sample. In the healthy individuals studied, the mitochondrial gene ND5 ranged from 1,140,000 to 7,050,000 copies per ~200 \u03bc l stool homogenate, corresponding to 9,300 to 182,000 copies per mg of stool collected. In the 69 serially collected stool specimens from the three HCT patients, the LINE-1 elements ranged from 130,000 to 150,600,000 copies (corresponding to approximately 5 to 6544 cells) per ~200 \u03bc l stool homogenate. For HCT patients, we could not estimate the number of cells/mg stool because stool weights were not available.

Although technical variation in DNA recovery efficiency does occur among replicate DNA isolations (Fig. 4) , this is small relative to the observed day-to-day variations. However in future studies, variation in DNA recovery efficiency could be measured and corrected for using synthetic DNA of artificial sequence spiked into the samples prior to DNA extraction 37 . Taken together, our data suggest that the majority of observed day-to-day variation is likely biological in origin, perhaps related to variation in diet, GI tract environment, GI inflammation or other factors. We speculate that the greater variations seen in the HCT patients may be a manifestation of GI tract damage that is common amongst HCT patients during their treatment course.",

Mitochondrial copy number alterations have been linked to autism 39, 40 and multiple types of cancer including breast cancer 41, 42 , bladder cancer 42 , kidney cancer 42 , and colon cancer 43, 44 . Thus for example, our mitochondrial DNA quantification assays could be adapted to measure such mt copy number alterations in biofluids (e.g., urine, blood, cyst fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid) in cancer patients as a biomarker approach. In addition, our methods could be adapted to other DNA targets, such as specific mutated or methylated DNA sequences in the nuclear genome, for example, which may be associated with cancer and other diseases of the GI tract.",

We detected between 253 and 8655 copies of mouse LINE-1 elements in stools from three healthy mice, further demonstrating the functionality of the pipeline. We envision this will facilitate disease studies in a broad range of mouse models of GI diseases. In our experiments, one to three pellets of healthy mouse stools per sample yielded DNA extracts that had to be diluted over 3000-fold for our ddPCR assay. This high sensitivity indicates that mouse DNA will be quantifiable even in sick animals which might produce liquid stools, for example. Taken together, the pipeline of methods for host DNA preservation and detection in stools we have described provides a convenient and highly sensitive tool for quantifying host cell DNA in the GI tract and can be applied broadly in studies of GI tract physiology and disease monitoring.",

These thresholds, although chosen arbitrarily, were set using droplet fluorescence values from NTC samples to define what would be considered negative droplets. The copy numbers per reaction of templatecontaining samples were averaged between the two extraction-duplicates to yield ACN sample . The copy numbers per reaction of ntc were averaged among the four technical replicates to yield ACN ntc . Then copy numbers of the templatecontaining samples were adjusted for background and dilution using the equation: (ACN sample -ACN ntc )*dilution-factor, which give the copies per onto TapeStation (P).

Stool specimens were brought to the laboratory within an hour. Stools were subsequently weighed, the buffer volume adjusted (for TEN2 only, see Materials and Methods), homogenised, and then aliquoted into five portions. Each aliquot was frozen at -80 \u00b0C after incubation at room temperature (22 \u00b0C) for one of five different time durations (0, 4, 24, 72, and 96 hours). SeeFig. 5afor a schematic diagram of the workflow. We then extracted faecal DNA from each of the time point samples using Norgen reagents and used ddPCR to measure LINE-1, mt, and bacterial DNA targets as per methods described above. in different buffers over time. In TEN2, ACN of both human and microbial DNA targets decreased over the course of four days storage at room temperature, indicating progressive DNA degradation. In EDTA, we found that the ACN of human genes tended to stay constant over time, and that of bacterial genes rose slightly over the four days, indicating modest growth of faecal bacteria. And in some samples preserved in OMNI, levels of host DNA decreased whereas those of bacterial DNA increased over the incubation period. Based on these results, we selected EDTA as the stool preservation solution for subsequent experiments.",

The duplicate purifications for each sample were processed at the same time. Stool DNA concentrations were measured using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).DNA Recovery Assessment of Purified Human Genomic DNA Using the Norgen Stool DNA Isolation KitHaeIII-digested human gDNA was spiked into cleared stool lysates, which were generated in the first phase of the Norgen Stool DNA Isolation protocol, following the initial centrifugation. The protocol was modified slightly for this experiment, in that multiple cleared stool lysates were first pooled. Then, different amounts (40 \u03bc l of 800, 80, 8, or 0 ng) of HaeIIIdigested gDNA were spiked into 560 \u03bc l aliquots of the pooled lysates. The DNA isolation procedure was completed and subsequently ddPCR for LINE-1 was carried out. The measured ACN for LINE-1 in this scenario comprises both that derived from the spiked-in gDNA, as well as LINE-1 present endogenously in the stool sample. In order to estimate recovery specifically of the spiked-in gDNA, we also measured ACN of LINE-1 present in aliquots of the same stool lysates without gDNA spike-in. This value was then subtracted from the measured ACN in the \"with gDNA spike-in\" sample to yield the ACN of the spiked-in gDNA. We then calculated % recovery efficiency as: [(measured ACN for spikedin gDNA)/(expected ACN for spiked-in gDNA)] x 100%. The expected ACN for spiked-in gDNA was determined by extrapolation, based on analyzing serial dilutions of HaeIII-digested human gDNA directly using ddPCR.Droplet Digital PCR for Human Stool SamplesIn a Bio-Rad QX200 droplet generatorprimer were partitioned into ~20,000 oil-emulsified droplets.One technical replicate for each of the TET buffer-diluted duplicate DNA extracts and four technical replicates of ntc were run on ddPCR.
