As of April 14, 2003, the cumulative number of cases of SARS was 3169, and 144 deaths have been reported. This epidemic shows no signs of abatement, in part because the mechanism of transmission remains unclear and the agent(s) that causes disease elusive. However, a previously unknown coronavirus, with or without another viral copathogen, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS.1 The involvement of a member of the coronavirus family, a large group of sizeable single-stranded RNA viruses with multiple serotypes, natural hosts, and tissue specificities, is intriguing; these viruses have had a good host adaptation and are frequent causes of the common cold.2 Life-threatening lower respiratory infections caused by coronaviruses are uncommon.2\n",

Moreover, the antigenic diversity of coronaviridiae capable of causing respiratory infection remains uncertain.2 There are several strains with a tropism to the human respiratory tract.2 Although most of the known strains are related antigenically to the two principal and antigenically-distinct human coronavirus strains, 229E and OC43,2 the SARS-causing coronavirus is a novel strain.1\n",

The availability of agents that could modulate key events of the coronavirus replicative cycle, such as viral attachment to target cells, could have important therapeutic implications. Some insights with respect to host receptors of human coronaviridiae could help us to find ways of halting viral spread. Specifically, the human cell membrane-bound metalloproteinase, aminopeptidase N (CD13), is the receptor for coronavirus 229E (but not for OC43);3 aminopeptidase N is also a receptor for enteropathogenic coronaviruses,4 indicating some degree of ligand-receptor promiscuity. This cell-surface glycoprotein is expressed in many human tissues, including lungs.5 Moreover, aminopeptidase N is highly expressed in immune cells and in the activated vascular endothelium of sites of inflammation,5 potentially providing an entry site. Potent and selective inhibitors of this receptor\u2014eg, ubenimex\u2014do exist.5 Ubenimex has been used as an oral agent with limited toxicity in patients with cancer.5 Also, this drug has immunomodulatory effects5 that might attenuate virus-induced lung injury.",
