Over much of that time, there has been a persistent debate about whether natural selection or random drift is the dominant force in molecular evolution (Kimura 1983; Gillespie 1991) . In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the ability to detect natural selection from patterns of DNA sequence variation, and the 'selectionist/neutralist debate' has matured into an effort to estimate the distribution of selective effects on genetic variation (Kreitman 1996; Hey 1999) . The strict neutral theory, on the other hand, has become the standard null hypothesis used to approach the study of molecular evolution, even if it is often rejected.",

These tests can suffer from low power and their assumptions are frequently violated, making strong inferences about selection difficult.

(1987) developed the first statistical test of neutrality to take advantage of the greater information content available from DNA sequence data compared to protein electrophoretic data. The test is based on the expectation that under an infinite sites neutral model (appropriate for DNA sequence variation within and among closely related species) the level of polymorphism at a gene within a species is proportional to the amount of divergence at that gene between species. This expectation can be tested by comparing levels of polymorphism and divergence at two or more genes using Hudson et al . \u2032 s (1987) test statistic. The HKA test can be applied to both DNA sequence and RFLP data, and has been used commonly to test for departures from neutral expectations (Table 1) . The HKA and related tests, like the earlier tests designed for allozyme data, makes specific assumptions about population structure which, if violated, can lead to rejection of the neutral model for reasons other than positive selection (Ford & Aquadro 1996; Ford 1998) . Sliding window graphs (Fig. 2) are a method of visualizing the HKA concept, and identifying specific regions of a gene responsible for the departure from neutral expectations. McDonald (1996 McDonald ( , 1998 has developed a formal statistical test using the sliding window approach.",

            "text": "Tajima's D -test. Tajima (1989) developed a statistical test of neutrality that uses only polymorphism data within a population. The test statistic, D , is based on the difference between two estimators of the neutral polymorphism parameter 4 N e \u00b5 , one based on the total number of polymorphic nucleotide sites observed and the other based on the average number of differences between all pairs of sequences sampled. Under neutrality, both methods are expected to produce the same value, and Tajima's D statistic is designed to test whether the difference between them is unlikely to be observed by chance alone. The test is essentially a method of testing the fit of the data to the expected neutral site frequency distribution, with negative D -values indicating an excess of rare variants and positive values indicating an excess of intermediate frequency variants. Like the HKA test, Tajima's test can be used on both RFLP and full sequence data. The test is sensitive to violations of its demographic assumptions and is not particlarly powerful (Tajima 1989; Simonsen et al . 1995) , so interpretation of test results can be uncertain. Fu (1997) discusses a number of similar tests. D n /d s tests. Hill & Hastie (1987) and Hughes & Nei (1988) were the first to use the ratio of nonsynonymous differences to synonymous differences among DNA sequences as a test for positive selection. The idea behind the test is that if synonymous mutations are essentially neutral because they do not result in a change in a protein, the rate of synonymous site evolution ( d s ) will equal the mutation rate (Kimura 1983) . Nonsynonymous mutations, because they result in a change in a protein product, are more likely to be subject to natural selection. If most nonsynonymous mutations are deleterious, then the rate of nonsynonymous evolution ( d n ) will be lower than neutral rate, resulting in d n /d s < 1. If a substantial fraction of nonsynonymous mutations are beneficial, however, the average rate of nonsynonymous evolution can be higher than the neutral rate, resulting in d n /d s > 1. Conceptually, all that is involved in performing a d n /d s ratio test is estimating the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions between two sequences and the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites in the sequences and then performing a statistical test to determine if the difference between the two ratios is greater than expected by chance alone. In practice, complications such as accounting for multiple substitutions at the same site, estimating the number synonymous and nonsynonymous sites, and accounting for transition/transversion ratios add considerable complexity to the problem, especially for highly divergent sequences (Nielsen 1997; Yang & Nielsen 2000) .",

In addition to providing potentially more accurate d n /d s estimates (Yang & Nielsen 2000) , the likelihood approaches allow estimation of d n /d s for individual branches of a phylogenetic tree, estimation of the proportion of codons in a sequence that are subject to positive selection, and identification of specific codon sites that are likely to have been subject to positive selection (Nielsen & Yang 1998, Fig. 1 ). Suzuki & Gojobori (1999) have developed an different method of detecting positive selection at single codons that uses a parsimony approach (see Suzuki & Nei 2001 for an initial comparison of the two methods).",

Under neutrality, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphisms with species is expected to be the same as the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous differences between species (Sawyer & Hartl 1992) . One striking finding that has emerged from using the test is that animal mtDNA genes generally have a greater number of nonsynonymous polymorphisms within species than expected compared to nonsynonymous divergence among species (e.g. Rand & Kann 1996) , apparently due to weak selection against slightly deleterious nonsynonymous mutations (Nielsen & Weinreich 1999) .",

Mutations that are selectively equivalent to the allele(s) already present in the population, on the other hand, are expected to have dynamics governed by genetic drift and to make up the vast majority of the observed variation both within and among species.

Sites that involve a change in a protein or a change in gene regulation are on average more conserved both within and among species than nonfunctional sites, exactly as predicted by the neutral theory.

            "text": "A second key aspect of the neutral theory, that most variation has dynamics governed predominantly by genetic drift, is not supported by observed patterns of DNA variation. An important general finding from studies in Drosophila is that there is a positive correlation between a gene's average recombination rate and its level of variability within species (Begun & Aquadro 1992; Aquadro et al . 1994) . Similar correlations have been found in humans (Nachman et al . 1998 (Nachman et al . , 2001 , sea beets (Kraft et al . 1998 ) and maize (Tenaillon et al . 2001) . The difference cannot be explained by differences in the neutral mutation rate because there is no correlation between a gene's interspecific divergence and its recombination rate (Begun & Aquadro 1992) . The explanation for the correlation appears to be due to the 'hitchhiking' of putatively neutral variation with sites that are under selection. One hitchhiking hypothesis that fits fairly comfortably within the paradigm of the neutral theory is that hitchhiking is due mainly to selection against new deleterious mutations that never reach high frequency (the background selection hypothesis - Charlesworth et al . 1993; Charlesworth 1996) . The other hypothesis is that the hitchhiking is due mainly to selection of new beneficial mutations that, because of their rapid fixation, 'selectively sweep' away large swaths of neutral variation in regions of low recombination (Begun & Aquadro 1992; Aquadro et al . 1994; Hudson 1994; Stephan 1995) . The relative degree to which selective sweeps and background selection shape patterns of variation across the genome remains unknown, and distinguishing between the two modes is active area of research (e.g. Fay & Wu 2000; Kim & Stephan 2000; Carr et al . 2001; Kauer et al . 2002; Wang et al . 2002) .",

First, regardless of whether the background selection or selective sweep hypothesis is more important, it means that a gene's recombinational environment is a large contributing factor in determining patterns of variation within species. Second, if the selective sweep hypothesis emerges as a major factor in creating the correlation, this would mean that even if much observed variation is selectively neutral, the dynamics of this neutral variation could well be governed more by linkage to selected sites than genetic drift. This is almost certainly true of genes in regions of low recombination, but linkage to selected sites can in theory be important even in regions of high recombination (Gillespie 2000) .",

Strictly speaking, this may be true on a per nucleotide site basis, considering that many changes in third codon position, introns and noncoding regions may often be selectively equivalent. However, the fraction of genes for which there is evidence of positive selection may be larger than postulated by the neutral theory. The only published study to attempt to estimate systematically the proportion of genes subject to positive selection is that of Endo et al . (1996) , who estimated nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratios ( d n /d s ) for 3595 groups of genes extracted from public databases. A d n /d s ratio > 1 provides evidence for positive selection (see Information box). Of the 3595 homologous groups of genes, Endo et al . (1996) found only 17 with evidence for positive selection -certainly a small fraction. However, their criteria for positive selection, d n /d s > 1 averaged over entire genes, was extremely stringent, considering that in most cases only a small fraction of the sites in a gene may be subject to positive selection (Yang & Bielawski 2000) . Simple d n /d s ratios are also far from the only method of detecting adaptive evolution at a gene (Information box). Other methods of detecting selection, particularly those that compare d n /d s ratios within and between species, are expected to be more powerful (Charlesworth et al . 2001; Fay et al . 2001) , and have been used to find selection in many genes with simple d n /d s ratios < 1 (Table 1 ). In addition, there are several examples of selection on noncoding sequences (e.g. Schulte et al . 1997; Wang et al . 1999 ) which would not be detected with any sort of d n /d s comparison.",

In some cases, even the functions of the genes in question are obscure. This situation has come about because it has become relatively easy to collect and analyse DNA sequences but it is much more difficult to elucidate a gene's functions, let alone determine how variation in those functions was influenced by natural selection in current or past populations. In some cases, particularly when a gene's function(s) are at least partially understood, it is possible to postulate a plausible adaptive hypothesis for why a gene has been subject to positive selection. These hypotheses can then suggest further experiments or observations that could be used to confirm or refute them as explanations for observed patterns of genetic variation. On the other hand, some of the cases of positive selection reported in the literature are inferred by comparing sequences from species that have diverged tens or sometimes even hundreds of millions of years ago. In most of these cases, a detailed understanding of the selective mechanisms leading to observed patterns of variation may well be unattainable (Hughes 1999) .",

For example, patterns of DNA sequence polymorphism can be used to determine if selection acting on a gene is directional (e.g. G6pd: Eanes et al. 1993) , balancing (e.g. PgiC: Liu et al. 1999) or both (e.g. Adh: Kreitman & Hudson 1991) . High d n /d s ratios among genes that make up a multigene family provide strong evidence that there has been selection for new functions after gene duplication (reviewed by Hughes 1999) . The observation of strong directional or balancing selection at a gene or gene region can be a useful tool for determining whether the gene is a good candidate for future functional studies. This approach is particularly powerful if specific nucleotide sites that have been the target of positive selection can be identified. Molecular biologists have long made use of a key paradigm of the neutral theory -that functionally important parts of a gene will be conserved -to identify candidate gene regions for further functional study. A similar approach can now be taken by identifying specific variable sites that show statistical evidence for adaptive evolution (Nielsen & Yang 1998; Suzuki & Gojobori 1999;  Fig. 1 ). ",

            "text": "A basic goal of physiological ecology is understanding how an organism's metabolism allows it to live in its environment. Many of the proteins that can be studied electrophoretically are involved in energy metabolism. After high levels of allozyme variation were discovered in the late 1960s (Harris 1966; Lewontin & Hubby 1966) , many studies were aimed at determining the functional and adaptive significance, if any, of observed variation (reviewed by Mitton 1997) . Functional studies have documented that variation in metabolic proteins can affect ecologically important traits such as flying or swimming performance and mating ability (see Powers et al. 1991; Mitton 1997; Watt & Dean 2000 for reviews) , and DNA sequence studies have found that many metabolic genes have patterns of variation inconsistent with neutrality (Table 1) . Studying allozyme loci at the DNA level is attractive because many of the genes code for proteins whose biochemical roles are well understood and which may contain variation important for understanding the distribution or behaviour of organisms (Mitton 1997; Eanes 1999) . Studies of DNA sequence variation at alloyzme genes are particularly useful for acquiring additional insight into the evolutionary history of previously documented allozyme variation, although the inferred histories can complicated (reviewed by Eanes 1999) . For example, the first allozyme locus to be studied extensively at the DNA level, alcohol dehydrogenase in Drosophila (Adh), has a peak of synonymous site polymorphism centred on the site that causes the allozyme polymorphism ( Fig. 2 : Kreitman & Hudson 1991) . This pattern of variation is inconsistent with a simple neutral model, and consistent with a balancing selection model (Kreitman & Hudson 1991) . In a more recent analysis of additional Adh sequences, however, Begun et al. (1999) suggest that the evidence of an old balanced polymorphism at Adh is not compelling, in part because the peak of synonymous polymorphism appears to predate the alloyzme polymorphism. Other Drosophila protein polymorphisms also have quite complicated inferred histories based on patterns of DNA sequence variation. For example, Sod, G6pd, Pgm, Tpi, Pgd and Amy all have patterns of variation that are inconsistent with neutrality but that are not suggestive of old balanced polymorphisms (see Table 1 for references). The type of selection occurring at these loci remains obscure, but may involve transient or regionally varying selection or evolutionarily young balanced polymorphisms. One unifying factor in studies of selection in D. melanogaster is its relatively recent migration from Africa, which may have created new selection pressures in non-African populations (Begun & Aquadro 1995; Takahashi et al. 2001; Kauer et al. 2002) . Outside Drosophila, other cases in which DNA sequence studies have found or confirmed evidence of positive selection at allozyme loci include Ldh-B in Fundulus (Powers et al. 1991; Schulte et al. 1997; Powers & Schulte 1998) , and PgiC in crickets (Katz & Harrison 1997) and several plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana: Kawabe et al. 2000 ; Leavenworthia sp.: Liu et al. 1999) . Hudson & Kreitman 1991 ; see also Begun et al. 1999) .

For example, concerns have been raised that modern agricultural plants and animals are becoming increasingly depauperate of genetic diversity and therefore vulnerable to environmental or biological insults their wild ancestors would have resisted (e.g. Notter 1999) . Understanding the genetic architecture and history of the domestication process provides useful information for the feasibility and utility of introducing new genetic material from a crop's wild ancestors (Tanksley & McCouch 1997) . Agricultural crops have also provided a useful experimental context for addressing fundamental ecological and evolutionary questions applicable to natural systems, including the genetic basis of morphological variation, genetic and ecological interactions between hosts and pathogens and the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. Finally, many agricultural crops are amenable to extensive transmission genetic analysis such that genes of interest can be located in the genome and cloned. This makes agricultural systems particularly attractive for studying the population genetics of genes that control or influence complex traits (Tanksley & McCouch 1997) .",

Recently, Doebley and colleagues used genetic mapping techniques to show that the teosinte branched-1 (tb1) locus is primarily responsible for one of the key morphological differences between maize and teosinte (Doebley et al. 1995 (Doebley et al. , 1997 . They then used a prediction of the neutral theory -that loci that have recently experienced strong directional selection are expected to have low levels of intraspecific variation -to see if there was evidence for selection at tb1 during the domestiction of maize . Wang et al. (1999) tested this expectation by sequencing a sample of tb1 alleles from maize and teosinte. They found that the 5\u2032 untranslated region of tb1 had much lower levels of variability in maize than in teosinte, consistent with a selective sweep of that gene region in maize (Fig. 2 ). An HKA test ( Information box) confirmed that the reduction in variability in maize was inconsistent statistically with neutral evolution.",

In this case, genealogical analysis of a gene under strong selection provided a much clearer biogeographical signal than genes evolving neutrally (Hilton & Gaut 1998) .

Based on patterns of variation at desat2, Takahashi et al. (2001) found that the cosmopolitan low ratio alleles were evolutionarily derived from an African/Caribbean high ratio allele. The low ratio alleles displayed little intra-allelic diversity and had a frequency spectrum inconsistent with an equilibrium neutral model but qualitatively consistent with a recent selective sweep. Takahashi et al.

One type of interspecific interaction that appears to lend itself readily to molecular analysis is the relationship between hosts and parasites. Recently, several investigators have used DNA sequence variation in plant genes involved in resistance to pathogens to gain insight into host/pathogen coevolution (reviewed by Bergelson et al. 2001; Holub 2001) . These studies have found that positive natural selection has played a role in the evolution of plant resistance genes in a variety of ways, including diversifying selection among members of resistance gene families (e.g. Botella et al. 1998) ; directional selection on genes among different species (e.g. Bishop et al. 2000) ; and balancing selection among alleles within species (Fig. 2 ; Stahl et al. 1999; Bittner-Eddy et al. 2000) . Stotz et al.'s (2000) study of fungal polygalacturonases (PGs) and their plant inhibitors (PGIPs) is a particularly good example of how neutrality tests can contribute to the understanding of interactions between hosts and pathogens. Stotz et al. (2000) analysed interspecific variation among 19 fungal PGs and 22 plant PGIPs, and found that many comparisons within each group had d n /d s significantly > 1, indicating that both the pathogen proteins and plant inhibitors were evolving by positive selection. More detailed analysis of d n /d s ratios using Nielsen & Yang's (1998) maximum likelihood method allowed Stotz et al. (2000) to identify nine codons in each group of genes with high posterior probabilities of being subject to positive selection.",

            "text": "The conclusion that variation at many genes is influenced by positive selection, either directly on the genes themselves or indirectly through the effects of linkage, has important implications for molecular ecology and conservation genetics. For example, the finding of pervasive effects of positive selection suggests that molecular ecologists must be cautious about analyses that rely upon untested assumptions of neutrality (Rand 1995) . For example, molecular ecologists and conservation geneticists use molecular genetics routinely to help address questions such as defining conservation units, studying biogeography and estimating effective population sizes or rates and patterns of gene flow. In most cases the genetic variants that are analysed are of no particular interest in themselves, but are used instead as putatively neutral markers of demographic or evolutionary histories (Avise 1994) . If a marker, or even an entire group of markers, that is assumed to be evolving neutrally is actually subject to selection, conclusions based on patterns of variation at the marker could be misleading. On the other hand, the ability to make strong inferences about the selective history of a gene opens up exciting new research areas for molecular ecologists to explore, although for most organisms there are several roadblocks standing in the way of research programmes based on studying natural selection at the molecular level. In what follows, the implications are discussed for molecular ecology if many putatively neutral markers turn out to be non-neutral. Rand (1995) warned conservation geneticists that assuming selective neutrality for allozyme and mtDNA variation routinely was problematic due to considerable evidence for the effects of natural selection at these classes of genetic markers. Assuming strict neutrality when in fact variation is affected by selection is particularly worth avoiding when conducting quantitative analyses, such as estimating divergence times, rates of gene flow or effective population sizes. In the 6 years since Rand's review, the number of published examples of positive selection has increased dramatically (Table 1) , so the need to examine carefully the consequences of false assumptions of neutrality appears even more justified now than it did in 1995.",

Variation at these loci is usually assumed to be selectively neutral, in part because microsatellites are often located in noncoding regions. Several recent results suggest that assumptions of strict selective neutrality at microsatellite loci must be viewed with caution, however. For example, some microsatellites are located in coding or promoter regions and may be under direct selection (e.g. microsatellites in the promoter region of Ldh-B in Fundulus heteroclitus: Schulte et al. 1997) .",

Furthermore, because microsatellite mutation rates vary across taxa, the power to detect the effects of hitchhiking selection on equilibrium levels of variation will vary as well (Schug et al. 1998; Wiehe 1998) . For example, in D. melanogaster there is a strong correlation between recombination rate and microsatellite variation similar to that observed for single nucleotide variation and due presumably to the combined effects of background selection and positive hitchhiking (Schug et al. 1998) . In contrast, in humans there is no evidence of a correlation between microsatellite variation and recombination, but there is a positive correlation between recombination and single nucleotide polymorphism (Nachman et al. 1998; Payseur & Nachman 2000; Nachman 2001) . The lack of a correlation between microsatellite variation and recombination in humans is due apparently to the high mutation rate of human microsatellites (\u223c10 \u2212 4 , references in Payseur & Nachman 2000) . Microsatellites in regions of low recombination will have the same reduced coalscent times as other sequences in the same regions, but may not have reduced levels of variation in humans due to mutational saturation (Wiehe 1998) . In contrast, in Drosophila microsatellite mutation rates are much lower (\u223c10 \u2212 6 ), take longer to become mutationally saturated and therefore have patterns of variation that are influenced more readily by background selection or selective sweeps (Schug et al. 1998 ).",

Conceptually, a way to answer this question would be to survey DNA sequence variation at a gene or genes with major effects on the trait and determine if the null hypothesis of selective neutrality can be rejected (i.e. a variation of Endler's (1986) model fitting method of studying natural selection). If the patterns of variation are statistically inconsistent with the neutral theory, but statistically consistent with positive natural selection, this would provide evidence that the variation in the trait of interest arose in response to natural selection. It may also be possible to make inferences about how, when and perhaps even where the selection occurred.

If a trait of interest is influenced only by many genes of small effect, it is more likely that the effects of selection on the trait would also be dispersed widely around the genome and therefore more difficult to detect from patterns of DNA sequence variation. In Drosophila, where considerable progress has been made dissecting the genetic basis of quantitative traits, the distribution of genic effects for several traits is roughly exponential with a few genes of large effect and many genes of small effect (Mackay 2001) . If this patterns holds for other traits and other species, it would mean that most traits will be influenced by some genes of large effect. Genetic mapping experiments in other species do generally find quantitative trait loci (QTL) of large effect (e.g. Schemske & Bradshaw 1999; Peichel et al. 2001) , but in these studies individual QTL almost always encompass large chromosomal regions containing hundreds of genes, so the effects of individual genes cannot be evaluated without extensive additional genetic analysis (Flint & Mott 2001) .",

There are several potential approaches. First, for many organisms it will be more fruitful to examine variation in genes whose functions are already well understood than to start with a phenotypic trait of interest and try to find the genes that influence it. A place to start might be genes whose products are involved in basic energy metabolism, such as the enzymes in the glycolytic pathway and the Krebs cycle. These genes code for products with well-understood biochemical functions that are similar across many organisms. Variation in at least some of these genes has been shown to be subject to positive natural selection and to contribute to ecological interesting variation in a variety of species (see above), making them good candidates for studying adaptive variation. Cloning these genes using heterologous probes or degenerate PCR primers is relatively straightforward (e.g. Katz & Harrison 1997) and will become more so as more sequences become available. For a great many organisms, variation at these genes has been surveyed using protein electrophoresis, and in some cases patterns of electrophoretic variation may suggest good candidates to study at the DNA level.",

Lukens & Doebley (2001) studied patterns of variation in the tb1 gene among members of the grass family to determine if this gene, which influences morphology in maize, had also been evolving adaptively in other grass species. A coat colour gene, Mc1r, isolated originally in mice, has been shown to affect coat colour in a variety of farm animals (Andersson 2001) , and there is evidence for positive selection acting on the same gene during primate evolution (Rana et al. 1999) . There is even weak evidence that the gene is subject to positive selection in humans, where it may influence skin and hair colour (Rana et al. 1999) . The CAULIFLOWER gene, isolated originally in Arabidopsis, was also found to affect floral morphology in domesticated Brassica sp. (Purugganan & Suddith 1998; Purugganan et al. 2000) .

Pogson et al. (1995) took this approach in their study of genetic variation in Atlantic cod. They surveyed variation initially within and among cod populations at a group of randomly cloned cDNA fragments, and found that as a class the random clones had greater levels of diversity among populations than did allozyme loci, suggesting the action of natural selection on one or both classes of loci. Pogson (2001) conducted a detailed analysis of sequence variation at one of the random clones and found that the gene (pantophysin) had d n /d s > 1 within cod populations. That observation provided additional evidence for positive selection, although the form of selection and even the gene's function remain obscure (Pogson 2001) . There is no way to know how often such random searches can be expected to find genes of interest, but this example suggests that developing methods of scanning genomes for positively selected genes would be worthwhile.",

D. melanogaster is one of the best understood animals genetically and developmentally, and studies in the species have led to fundamental advances in population genetics Hey 1999) . Despite this wealth of knowledge, D. melanogaster has been the subject of relatively few ecological studies and the ecological factors causing selection on even the famous Adh polymorphism are not well understood (Hughes 1999 ). More intensive ecological study of D. melanogaster, and other genetically well-characterized organisms, would clearly be beneficial.",

In large part, this is because DNA sequences can provide an informative record of their own evolutionary history. Over the last 20 years, investigators have made substantial progress in their ability to read and make sense of the historical information stored in DNA sequences. As more genes are sequenced and their allelic diversity analysed within and among species, the challenge will be not so much to find genes that have evolved under positive selection but to understand causes of the selective pressures.",
