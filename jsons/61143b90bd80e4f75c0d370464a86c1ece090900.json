Originally studied in the context of infectious diseases [1] [2] [3] [4] , contagion has now been used as a metaphor for diverse processes that spread by contact between neighbors. Examples include the spread of fads and fashions [5, 6] , scientific ideas [7] , bank failures [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , computer viruses [13] , gossip [14] , rumors [15, 16] , and yawning [17] . Closely related phenomena arise in probability theory and statistical physics in the setting of first-passage percolation [18, 19] , and in evolutionary dynamics in connection with the spread of mutations through a resident population [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . We use the language of contagion throughout, but bear in mind that everything could be reformulated in the language of the other fields mentioned above.",

For d-dimensional cubic lattices, the dependence on d is intriguing: we find that T is normally distributed for d = 1 and d = 2, then becomes skewed for d 3 and approaches the convolution of two Gumbel distributions as d approaches infinity. We conclude by discussing the many simplifications in our model, with the aim of showing how the model relates to more realistic models. We also discuss the possible relevance of our results to fixation times in evolutionary dynamics, population genetics, and cancer biology, and to the longstanding (yet theoretically unexplained) clinical observation that incubation periods for infectious diseases frequently have right-skewed distributions.",

The fixation time is defined as the time required for a fitter mutant (think of a precancerous cell in a tissue) to sweep through a population of less fit wild-type individuals (normal cells). Initially, a single mutant is introduced at a random node of the network. At each time step, one individual is randomly chosen to reproduce. With probability proportional to its fitness, it gives birth to one offspring, and one of its network neighbors is randomly chosen to die and be replaced by that offspring. The natural questions are as follows: What is the probability that the lineage of the mutant will eventually take over the whole network?

Using Markov chains, Hindersin and colleagues provided exact calculations of the fixation probability and average fixation times for a wide family of graphs, as well as an investigation of the dependence on microscopic dynamics [22, 23, 47, 48] . A challenge for this approach is that the size of the state space becomes intractable quickly: even with sparse matrix methods, it grows like N 2 N [47] . For networks of size N < 23, their computations showed that the distributions of mutant fixation times were skewed to the right, much like the Gumbel distributions, convolutions of Gumbel distributions, and intermediate distributions found analytically and discussed here in Secs.

We saw an instance of such an expanding cluster in Sec. V. In a general number of dimensions, the provable nature of this shape may be complicated; the fluctuations of its boundary are thought to depend on the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equations [19, 53, 54] . The limiting shape is not typically a Euclidean ball, but it has been proven to be convex; see Refs. [18, 19] for an introductory discussion of these issues.

While heterogeneous networks are outside the scope of this work, our initial results suggest that the takeover times there too are distributed in a right-skewed fashion resembling a Gumbel distribution (see Appendix I). In the future, we hope to link our model to more concrete real-world phenomena and experimental data, connecting our abstract \"step-based\" takeover times with physically meaningful times on time scales appropriate for the situation in question. When we were analyzing the 1D lattice, we could not quite make use of the classical central limit theorem, since our variables X have a dependence on N , being Geo(1/N ).",
