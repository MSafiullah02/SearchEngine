Lymphocytes were fused with lymphoma cell line BW5147 (kindly provided by Dr. Annette Oxenius, ETH Z\u00fcrich) using polyethylene glycol 1500 (PEG 1500; Roche) following the manufacturer's instructions. Upon addition of hypoxanthin-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT; Gibco) selection medium, proliferating clones were tested for antigen specificity using K d /s598 tetramer binding and IFN-\uf067 response after in vitro restimulation with s598-605 peptide. Monoclonal MHVSpike 598-605specific clones were obtained by limiting dilution. Following RNA isolation using TRIzol (Invitrogen), cDNA synthesis was performed using Super Script II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo (dT) primers. Variable genes of MHVSpike 598-605 -specific TCR were analyzed by flow cytometry and RT-PCR using previously published primer pairs (Baker et al., 2002) . The DNA sequence of the MHVSpike 598-605specific TCR was analyzed by PCR sequencing and sequence alignment using the databases IMGT (http://www.imgt.org/) and Ensemble (http://www.ensembl.org/Mus_musculus). TCR variable regions of MHVSpike 598-605 -specific TCR (V\u03b12J\u03b17 and V\u03b216J\u03b22-1) were cloned into TCR expression vectors (Kouskoff et al., 1993) to obtain pTS alfa V\u03b12J\u03b17 and pTS beta V\u03b216J\u03b22-1. Upon removal of the prokaryotic backbone, linearized DNA fragments were co-injected in equimolar ratios into fertilized C57BL/6N oocytes according to the standard method (Rulicke, 2004) .",
