Otherwise, under the circumference of wildly spread of COVID\u201019 and low detection rate by pharyngeal swab COVID\u201019 nucleic acid test, how to distinguish it from other common respiratory tract infection pathogens in pediatric patients is still a problem.

As consolidations with surrounding halo sign account for up to 50% cases, they should be considered as typical signs in pediatric patients. Pleural effusion was not seen. The absorption of lesions on chest CT lagged behind clinical symptoms and nucleic acid detection. Lesions could be still visible on chest CT when two consecutive nucleic acid tests were negative. As for the normal findings in three neonates with a positive nucleic acid test, whether it was due to the influence of the delivery process on sampling or the specific CT manifestations for neonates, more samples are needed for further confirmation.",

Respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus pneumonia lesions were mostly distributed along the bronchial tree with a thickened bronchial wall. Influenza viruses could cause grid\u2010like changes in the lungs. In addition, it should be differentiated from bacterial pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia, and chlamydia pneumonia, and the density of pneumonia lesions caused by the latter pathogens is relatively higher. However, chest CT manifestations of pneumonia caused by different pathogens overlap, and COVID\u201019 pneumonia can be superimposed with pneumonia caused by other types of pathogens, presenting more serious and complex imaging manifestations, so epidemiological and etiological examination should be combined.",

In the case that the positive rate of COVID\u201019 nucleic acid test from pharyngeal swab samples is not high, the early detection of lesions by CT is conducive to reasonable management and early treatment for pediatric patients. However, the diagnosis of COVID\u201019 pneumonia by CT imaging alone is not sufficient enough, especially in the case of coinfection with other pathogens. Therefore, early chest CT screening and timely follow\u2010up, combined with corresponding pathogen detection, is a feasible clinical protocol in children.",
