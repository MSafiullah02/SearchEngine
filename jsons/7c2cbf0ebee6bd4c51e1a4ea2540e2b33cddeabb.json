            "text": "The concern about (socio-)economic consequences of collective lockdowns in the Covid-19 pandemic calls for alternative strategies. We consider a divide and conquer strategy in which a high risk group (HRG) is put on strict isolation, whereas the remainder of the population is exposed to the virus, building up immunity against Covid-19. The question is whether this strategy may suppress the effective reproduction number below the critical value of R eff < 1 without further lockdown once the HRG is released from isolation. While this proposal appears already rather academic, we show that R eff < 1 can only be obtained provided that the HRG is less than \u223c 20 \u2212 30% of the total population. Hence, this strategy is likely to fail in countries with a HRG larger than the given upper bound. In addition, we argue that the maximum infection rate occurring in this strategy is likely to exceed realistic capacities of most health care systems. While the conclusion is rather negative in this regard, we emphasise that the strategy of stopping the curve at an early stage of the Covid-19 pandemic has a chance to work out. The required duration of the lockdown is estimated to be \u03c4 \u223c 14 days/(1 \u2212 R eff ) (up to some order one factor) for R eff < 1, provided a systematic tracing strategy of new infections exists for the subsequent relaxation phase. In this context we also argue why R eff remains the crucial parameter which needs to be accurately monitored and controlled.",

However, this goes at the cost of significant economic decline including growing debts and unemployment (for studies on (socio-)economic impacts see e.g. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] ). While the Covid-19 pandemic directly threatens our health, the link between economic growth and our health is rather implicit and non-trivial. The lockdown particularly protects the so-called high risk group (HRG) [8] [9] [10] , whereas the economic consequences will affect the whole population. Consequently, in Germany (and most likely in other countries as well) doubts have been raised whether the current mitigation measures are proportionate.",

The hope behind this proposal is that the decline of the economic growth is minimised while the health care system is kept stable (because the non-HRG is less likely to require intensive treatment), see e.g. [1] for related work in this direction. Apart from various practical issues with this proposal, this strategy makes only sense if the effective reproduction number eventually drops below R eff < 1 once the HRG can be released from the isolation. Of course, the hope is that R eff < 1 is reached purely due to the immunity of the non-HRG. This would mean that the Covid-19 pandemic is in control even without further measures afterwards.",

Since the testing has become more intense in this period, the above is likely to overestimate R 0 . Nevertheless our estimate is still consistent with the figures computed in [16] . In Figure 1 the underlying dynamics of the SIR-model is shown. The eqs. (2.2) to (2.4) have been integrated numerically via the Euler method with initial conditions S(0) = 80 \u00b7 10 6 , I(0) = 114 and R(0) = 0. We observe that smaller R 0 suppresses the peak I max (see also (2.18) for an analytical expression), and also shifts the time of herd immunity, t H , further into the future. In particular, for a Covid-19 pandemic without any mitigation attempts we can estimate 2 months t H 6 months. This estimation intends to give an idea about time scales of a pandemic. Moreover, unsurprisingly, the plateau of the R-curve decreases for smaller R 0 . Using (2.15) we obtain \u03b1(2.0) 0.80, \u03b1(3.0) = 0.94 and \u03b1(4.0) = 0.98. Hence, without any measures between 80%\u221298% of the population will have had contact with the virus at the end of the pandemic.

In particular we see that R eff < 1.2 is needed to remain below the bound of 60 \u00b7 10 3 infections per day. Therefore, the parameter range of the effective reproduction number in flattening the curve is 1 < R eff < 1.2, and hence very tiny. We call this requirement fine-tuning. The weaker the health care system the stronger the fine-tuning needs to be. Given the error bars in measuring R eff (see [16] ) it seems quite challenging to keep control of the pandemic within this strategy. In particular, the precise impact of different measures on R eff is unknown at present. Furthermore, the strategy flatten the curve seems to require a duration of larger than one year! Consequently, flattening the curve seems not be the way to go in the Covid-19 pandemic.",

Second, despite exposing only rather young and healthy people to the virus, the number of daily infections to be expected will probably still exceed Germany's health care system. Although the result on this strategy is negative, we find the problem of quantifying this scenario interesting in itself, resulting in nice inequalities (3.4) and (3.7) with useful applications in the development of new containment strategies.",
