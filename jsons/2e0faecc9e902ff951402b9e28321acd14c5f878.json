The hospital capacity decreased by 28.00% (35 inpatient beds) during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic period. The epidemic caused a greater impact on medical work related to lung cancer after the Chinese New Year holiday. Patients were most concerned about longer waiting time for outpatient services, inpatient beds, physical examinations, or surgeries (406; 50.56%), the possibility of infection with the novel coronavirus (359; 44.71%), difficulties in getting to a hospital due to transportation outages (279; 34.74%). Patients in stage I and II showed less fear about disease progression (14, 18.18%; 4, 14.81%), lower proportions of delayed medical arrangement (15, 19.48%; 6, 22.22%) and less complain about complex treatment procedures (12, 15.58%, 5, 18.52%).

They may be related to the delay in routine medical examinations or treatment arrangements for some patients. The reduced number of inpatient admissions and surgeries was due to the fact that rooms previously used for patients with early-or advanced-stage lung cancer before the outbreak were repurposed to quarantine and treat patients with COVID-19 during the pandemic. Elective admissions for surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and emergency admissions to manage toxicities of cancer related symptoms were also mainly influenced by the room occupied. In China, another factor influencing the admissions process was that every non-emergent patient and their accompany relatives have to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid 2 or 3 times before admission. This was an effective measure to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak in the hospital, but 2-3 days are required to receive the result. Moreover, patient's attitude towards daily medical treatment was more cautious during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traffic control and the risk of exposure in hospitals prevent people from going to hospitals, which is beneficial for epidemic control, but it can also be problematic for those with other diseases that need to be diagnosed and treated. In addition, the sudden COVID-19 outbreak has led to insufficient supplies of protective equipment and the reduction in the number of blood donors. Medical staff in different positions were recruited to support the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Overall, the lack of medical resources makes medical staff more conservative in their daily work. Therefore, allocation of scarce resources in a pandemic should be based on maximizing health benefits. 11 At this time, a special guideline for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of lung cancer during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will help provide orderly conduct of daily medical work. 12 In addition, patient's subjective feelings should not be ignored, especially during crisis periods. According to our study, their most of their concerns during the epidemic include longer waiting time for outpatient services, inpatient beds, examinations, or surgeries (406, 50.56%). Others included possibility of being infected with the novel coronavirus (359, 44.71%) and difficulties in going to hospital due to transportation outages (279, 34.74%). In addition, 209 (26.03%) patients indicated that their treatment was delayed due to the current COVID-19 outbreak. Subgroup analysis suggested that patients in stage III and IV seems face more difficulties than those in stage I and II. That is understandable because locally advanced and advanced lung cancer patients with a higher tumor burden are elder and have shorter absent treatment windows period and worse prognosis than those in early stage. Some of them are immunocompromised, vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Besides, more patients with lung cancer in high-infected areas complained of longer appointment periods, which may be related to the mobilization of more resources in these areas to fight COVID-19. Long waiting periods along with delayed diagnosis and treatment may lead to the lung cancer progression and interfere with the best treatment outcomes.",

Surgical indication under such circumstances should be holding tight and surveillance interval should be extended in consideration of its slow-growing tumor biology and possibility of benign disease. Second, for patients with locally advanced lung cancer and N2 positive status, which is high heterogeneous, neoadjuvant-targeted therapy was preliminary proven safe and efficient in patients harboring activating mutations in oncogenes such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). 14, 15 Multiple ongoing clinical trials incorporating checkpoint inhibitors into neoadjuvant therapy for NSCLC had showed encouraging findings about high major pathologic response (MPR) rate. [16] [17] [18] Therefore, neoadjuvant targeted therapy or immunotherapy is considerable option when medical supply was limited and immediate surgery was not available. For patients with advanced disease, medical policy should allow outpatient to be provided prescription dose for longer times in case of repeated round trip for prescription. On the other hand, patients who should have returned for immunotherapy or chemotherapy could be bypassed to the local hospitals which beard less clinical burden of COVID-19. The safety and efficacy are similar for patients transitioning from nivolumab 3mg/kg Q2W to 480mg Q4W 19 or from pembrolizumab 2mg/kg Q3W to 400 mg Q6W. 20 Long dosing interval would decrease the frequency of visit to the hospital and has the potential to reduce SARS-Cov-2 exposure risk. Both immunotherapy and chemotherapy could notably influence the host immune system, which may interact with COVID-19 infection causing extra damage. Therefore, we should obviously stay vigilant for suspected infectors receiving antitumoral treatment in case of disease deterioration. Finally, for patients involved in ongoing trials before COVID-19 epidemic, delayed medication might influence the efficacy and meanwhile, violate the study protocol. Affiliated centers should unleash their local advantages to proceed treatment for those who took medication injection like immunotherapy or chemotherapy. Also, study nurses should keep close online follow-up of participants to ease up their anxiety.",

Until now, over three thousand physicians were reported to be infected while working in their clinical practice even when they maintained vigilance for the disease. Considering its relative long latency period and lack of classic symptoms, it's definitely pivotal to reduce chance of those innocent patients getting infected on the road to fight against cancer. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, solving immediate problems and preventing problems are two equally important responsibilities for every leader globally. 21 China's experience in epidemic prevention will help governors and medical staff in other countries to fight the COVID-19. In the fast-rising period of the epidemic, some medical problems might be temporarily suppressed or ignored due to the focus on SARS-CoV-2. However, as the epidemic continues, other medical problems will gradually be exposed, and lung cancer is one of them. This study provides a reference for how lung cancer or other life-threatening diseases during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has been managed.",

Another limitation of current study is that the patients surveyed were mainly derived from Guangdong and Hunan provinces. Therefore, the results may not be sufficiently representative for other places. From January 18th to April 18th, only one inpatient (1/24) was found to have both lung cancer and COVID-19 in our center. He was a 57-year-old man with mild COVID-19 and advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma. He used to receive treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, chemo-immunotherapy and chemotherapy. He had a fever as the initial and only symptom after he came back from Wuhan. As per the local policy, he underwent corona virus testing, was quarantined in our hospital, and then transferred to an infectious disease hospital for further treatment as soon as he tested positive. However, we could not determine the outcome due to the patient being transferred.",
