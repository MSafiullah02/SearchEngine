Facing this tough situation of possible shortage of masks, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) in Taiwan announced a name-based rationing system for masks on February 3, 2020, which would be launched three days after the announcement. The policy was expected to be capable of ensuring universal access to face masks as well as fairness and transparency of resources allocation and curbing the hoarding of face masks.",

Furthermore, office workers and people with disabilities can ask their family members or friends to buy face masks on their behalf. However, each person is allowed to buy face masks for another person by presenting the person's IC card, and the abovementioned rules of purchase apply. Moreover, face masks for children are only allowed to be purchased when IC cards of children under 12 are presented.\"",
