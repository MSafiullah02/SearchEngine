The role of infections in disease pathogenesis and progression is known to be important, yet the mechanisms involved remain to be fully elucidated. While COPD pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Streptococcus pneumoniae are strongly associated with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), the clinical relevance of these pathogens in stable COPD patients remains unclear. Immune responses in stable and colonized COPD patients are comparable to those detected in AECOPD, supporting a role for chronic colonization in COPD pathogenesis through perpetuation of deleterious immune responses. Advances in molecular diagnostics and metagenomics now allow the assessment of microbe-COPD interactions with unprecedented personalization and precision, revealing changes in microbiota associated with the COPD disease state. As microbial changes associated with AECOPD, disease severity and therapeutic intervention become apparent, a renewed focus has been placed on the microbiology of COPD and the characterization of the lung microbiome in both its acute and chronic states. Characterization of bacterial, viral and fungal microbiota as part of the lung microbiome has the potential to reveal previously unrecognized prognostic markers of COPD that predict disease outcome or infection susceptibility. Addressing such knowledge gaps will ultimately lead to a more complete understanding of the microbe-host interplay in COPD.

This states that recurrent infection and mucus hypersecretion were the primary causes of progressive airways obstruction in smokers. However, subsequent studies failed to detect significant associations between infection and lung function decline and consequently exposure to noxious particles and gases was advanced as the principal cause of COPD. 1 A wealth of evidence shows that the isolation of bacteria, viruses and fungi in the airways of stable COPD patients is in fact significant and has implications for disease pathogenesis, progression and treatment. This places a renewed emphasis on microorganisms isolated from the COPD lung, driving us to revisit the original British hypothesis. 2 Advances in diagnostic technologies now permit a more accurate detection of specific pathogens in COPD while molecular studies shed light on the immune response elicited by COPD-associated microorganisms. Metagenomic studies have revealed microbial consortia in both healthy and diseased individuals, helping to define pathogenic and beneficial microbes associated with various disease states. This has major implications for our understanding of COPD and its therapy, particularly in the face of antibiotic-mediated lung dysbiosis during therapy. Therefore, both acute and chronic infections are linked to COPD progression and exist as components of overarching lung microbiome architecture, which is modulated during therapeutic intervention. Characterizing this dynamic interaction between microbes, therapy and disease states is now a central focus in COPD research. Furthermore, the emergence of antibiotic resistance in COPD-associated pathogens is also a growing international concern and greater emphasis on antimicrobial stewardship and rational therapies is of increasing importance.

They can have marked effects on lung function, quality of life and health socio-economic burden. The exact nature and cause of these events can often be difficult to establish clinically, but in general infections are largely blamed, with up to 80% of AECOPD linked to either bacterial or viral pathogens. 3, 4 Because a certain subset of COPD patients have frequent exacerbations, the concept of inherent susceptibility to acute infection in COPD subsequently triggering AECOPD events has been developed. Several studies have now demonstrated that COPD patients feature impaired innate immunity, the first line of defence against infection. Alveolar macrophages resident in the airways provide the key initial response to bacteria by both recognizing and removing harmful pathogens through phagocytosis, but in COPD, these functions may be impaired. Recently, Berenson et al. investigated Toll-like receptor (TLR) expression and responses in alveolar macrophages collected from exacerbationprone and exacerbation-free COPD patients. 5 In response to exposure to common COPD-related pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, alveolar macrophages from exacerbation-prone patients had diminished TLR2 expression and cytokine responses. Similarly, alveolar macrophages from COPD patients appear to phagocytose H. influenzae and S. pneumonia poorly compared with those of control patients yet they still release reactive oxygen species (ROS). 6, 7 Together, these studies suggest that COPD patients have impaired responses to bacterial colonization and infection which in turn increases susceptibility to AECOPD and promotes an oxidative stress response (Fig. 1) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 413, "end": 415, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 416, "end": 417, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 968, "end": 996, "text": "Berenson et al. investigated", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1141, "end": 1142, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1600, "end": 1602, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1604, "text": "7", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1811, "end": 1819, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "ACUTE INFECTION IN COPD: VIRAL AND BACTERIAL SUPERINFECTION AND THEIR ROLE IN COPD EXACERBATION"}, {"text": "Defects in innate immunity may also play a role in increased susceptibility to viruses. Recognition of viral infection by the innate immune system is essential for coordinating an effective antiviral response in the airways, yet in patients and mice with COPD, the cascade from recognition to response falters. This involves increases in phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase responses and impaired antiviral stress granule formation including type I interferon (IFN) signalling. 8 In the healthy host, pathogen recognition by TLR3 triggers IFN pathways that then can hinder viral replication and mediate adaptive immune responses. In epithelial cells, constitutive type 1 IFNs are critical for protection. 9, 10 In these cells and lung fibroblasts exposed to cigarette smoke, responses are reduced and even stimulation with IFN-\u03b2 yields a diminished antiviral response. 11 Furthermore, mucociliary clearance, which is key for the removal of virus from the airways, appears to be perturbed in COPD. Cigarette smoke exposure reduces both the number and length of cilia, 12 while goblet cell hyperplasia in COPD leads to more viscous mucus in the airways, further impeding proper ciliary motion. 13 In mouse models, respiratory viruses themselves can induce mucus hypersecretion, contributing to the inability to clear the virus from the airway. 14 Of the 80% of exacerbations with an infectious cause, approximately half are bacterial in origin while approximately 30% are viral. 4, 15 Numerous studies have been performed to classify the most common pathogens implicated in AECOPD using sputum samples to identify bacteria and nasopharyngeal swabs to identify viruses. In a landmark 2002 study, Sethi et al. traced longitudinal sputum cultures in 81 moderate-to-severe COPD patients during both times of clinical stability and exacerbation. 16 Interestingly, the acquisition of a new strain of bacteria (discovered through molecular typing) was highly associated with the development of an AECOPD. The relative risk of an exacerbation varied with each new species: 1.69 for H. influenzae, 1.77 for S. pneumoniae and 2.96 for M. catarrhalis. Since then, more sensitive quantitative PCR methods of identifying bacteria relative to standard culture methods have enabled better quantification and typing of bacterial strains during exacerbations. In one study, while species such as H. influenzae and S. pneumonia were identified in stable states, their relative loads, determined by PCR, were considerably higher during exacerbations (10 8 cfu/mL vs 10 7 cfu/mL for both species). 17 The most prevalent species identified during exacerbation was S. pneumoniae, followed by H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis and Legionella pneumophila. In more severe COPD patients (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) < 50% predicted), Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also frequently encountered as a cause of exacerbations (Table 1) . 24 Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections appear to portend a worse prognosis with higher 30-and 90day mortality rates compared with exacerbations not associated with this bacterium. 25 Viruses implicated in the development of AECOPD include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus and coronavirus. [33] [34] [35] A meta-analysis of 19 studies (totalling 1728 patients) evaluated the pooled prevalence of respiratory viruses in AECOPD and found that rhinoviruses/enteroviruses were the most commonly encountered virus (16%), followed by RSV (10%) and influenza (8%). Of lesser prevalence were coronaviruses (4%), parainfluenza (3%), human metapneumovirus (3%) and adenovirus (2%). 28 Coinfection with two or more viruses has also been reported, 36 with one study noting that in their cohort, only the patients with viral co-infections were severe enough to be admitted to the hospital for their exacerbations. 34 While simultaneous bacterial and viral pathogens have been detected during acute exacerbations, it remains unclear whether these co-infections carry any greater risk for poor outcomes in comparison to single infections. 37 They indeed may simply represent more severe disease as other studies have detected. 38, 39 More compelling is the notion of 'superinfection', where an acute viral infection in COPD may set up the necessary microenvironment in the lung for a subsequent bacterial infection or vice versa. In an experimental rhinovirus infection, where COPD and control patients were nasally inoculated with low doses of rhinovirus, only COPD patients developed significant increases in sputum bacterial load post-viral infection. 40 While sputum viral loads peaked between days 5 and 9 post-inoculation, bacterial loads peaked later around day 15, confirming that in these studies viral infection can promote bacterial superinfection. Subjects who ultimately developed secondary bacterial infections had lower baseline FEV 1 compared with those who remained free from secondary infections. A plausible mechanism was suggested whereby rhinovirus infection induces neutrophil elastase (NE) production, which then degrades the antimicrobial peptides elafin and secretory leukoprotease inhibitor, both of which may be important in protecting subjects from bacterial infections. 40 These data suggest that AECOPD events thought to be bacterially induced may in fact have been preceded by an initial viral infection. Moreover, greater vigilance for superinfections in patients with more severe lung function may be warranted.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 472, "end": 473, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 699, "end": 701, "text": "9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 702, "end": 704, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 863, "end": 865, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1063, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1188, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1338, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1471, "end": 1473, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1474, "end": 1476, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1687, "end": 1706, "text": "Sethi et al. traced", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1835, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2570, "end": 2572, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 2904, "end": 2906, "text": "24", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3082, "end": 3084, "text": "25", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 3265, "end": 3269, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 3270, "end": 3274, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3275, "end": 3279, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 3647, "end": 3649, "text": "28", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 3711, "end": 3713, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 3876, "end": 3878, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 4099, "end": 4101, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 4187, "end": 4190, "text": "38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 4191, "end": 4193, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 4615, "end": 4617, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 5259, "end": 5261, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2892, "end": 2901, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "ACUTE INFECTION IN COPD: VIRAL AND BACTERIAL SUPERINFECTION AND THEIR ROLE IN COPD EXACERBATION"}, {"text": "Microorganisms are commonly detected in the airways in stable COPD and are considered 'colonizers' in the absence of acute infective symptoms (Table 1) . However, the term colonization in this context may be debated, as the microorganisms identified in stable COPD are not necessarily benign. Collective evidence favours the vicious cycle hypothesis whereby an inciting event (e.g. smoking) leads to an impaired innate immune response and results in bacterial colonization. 41 This in turn promotes airway and systemic inflammation leading to COPD progression. As airway inflammation persists despite smoking cessation, the presence of a persistent stimulus-independent of cigarette smoke-is consistent with a role for colonizing bacteria in the pathogenesis of COPD. 42, 43 Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed on epithelial and innate immune cells, activates signal transduction pathways including nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-\u03baB), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphoinositide-3-kinase and IFN regulatory factors. 44 This results in the production of proinflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines. In turn, the recruitment of neutrophils to the airways ensues, a feature characteristic of bacterially colonized COPD patients. 45 Neutrophils are antiinfective and have recently been found to have modulatory functions. 46 In COPD, neutrophils are intrinsically altered with abnormal host defence functions and have unusual chemotactic behaviour and migratory structure. 47 Activated neutrophils cause lung destruction and emphysematous change through the release of oxygen radicals and proteolytic enzymes, including NE that reduces ciliary function, induces epithelial damage and is a potent stimulator of mucin production. 47 The resulting mucus production and impaired mucociliary clearance leads to further bacterial colonization and airway obstruction. Additionally, increased levels of airway inflammatory markers such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and NE are found in stable COPD patients with bacterial colonization compared with those without bacterial colonization, strongly implicating the colonized state with a deleterious immune response. 45, 47 Such persistent inflammation is associated with increased daily symptoms, exacerbations and mortality. 48, 49 Defective phagocytosis is also characteristic of COPD particularly that of alveolar-and monocyte-derived macrophages, which in turn likely contributes to chronic bacterial colonization and infective exacerbations. 6 This is clearly evidenced by the observed impaired phagocytosis of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis with increasing COPD severity. 50 In addition, alveolar macrophage surface receptors (TLR2, TLR4 and scavenger receptor (MARCO)) that respond to intracellular signalling and phagocytosis are seen to be diminished in both COPD and smokers. [51] [52] [53] Chronic bacterial colonization also activates adaptive immune responses, with the development of B-cell lymphoid follicles and production of mucosal IgA and serum IgG antibody including strainspecific IgG antibody against bacterial colonizers, a phenomenon characteristic of the COPD airway. 54 Increases in lymphoid follicles have been noted in the small airways of patients with severe COPD, possibly secondary to chronic airway infection. 55 Thus, impaired innate immune responses likely contribute to microbial airway colonization while the activation of adaptive immunity suggests a state of heightened immune surveillance associated with lung function decline in established COPD.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 474, "end": 476, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 768, "end": 771, "text": "42,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 772, "end": 774, "text": "43", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1101, "end": 1103, "text": "44", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1326, "end": 1328, "text": "45", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1418, "end": 1420, "text": "46", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1569, "end": 1571, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 1824, "end": 1826, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2328, "end": 2331, "text": "45,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 2332, "end": 2334, "text": "47", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 2438, "end": 2441, "text": "48,", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 2442, "end": 2444, "text": "49", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 2659, "end": 2660, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2792, "end": 2794, "text": "50", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 3000, "end": 3004, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 3005, "end": 3009, "text": "[52]", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 3010, "end": 3014, "text": "[53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}, {"start": 3307, "end": 3309, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 3457, "end": 3459, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 142, "end": 151, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Role in COPD pathogenesis"}, {"text": "Potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PPMs) have been isolated in up to 74% of stable COPD patients. 56 The commonest PPMs identified include H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, S. pneumonia, P. aeruginosa and Chlamydophila pneumoniae similar to the culprit repertoire in AECOPD and severe asthma. 57 Bacterial colonization is, however, a dynamic process with alterations in pathogen type, load and strain over time. Increases in bacterial load and changes in species are associated with greater lung function decline and airway inflammation. 18, 19 Non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi) is the most common bacteria isolated in both the stable state and during AECOPD. It alone accounts for up to half of all bacteria isolated in the lower airways of stable COPD patients. 17, 18, 20 The differing cell surface proteins facilitate bacterial adhesion to the respiratory mucosa including outer membrane proteins P2 and P5 that bind to mucin, and adhesin (HMW1 and HMW2) which adhere to the epithelial and extracellular matrix. [58] [59] [60] Lipooligosaccharide, a key component of the NTHi cell wall, and the outer membrane protein P6 are potent immunomodulators for macrophages leading to increased phagocytosis and cytokine secretion, including IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 which drive neutrophil recruitment. [60] [61] [62] [63] Given the defective phagocytic ability of the COPD alveolar macrophage, a failure of bacterial clearance potentially leads to the state of persistent infection. 6,63 Furthermore, NTHi is uniquely able to survive intracellularly within the alveolar macrophages. 64 Through its secreted proteases, it cleaves IgA and in turn protects against IgA-mediated cytotoxicity. 65 Where persistent, COPD NTHi infection of the lower airway results in increased inflammation with elevated levels of IL-8, IL-1\u03b2, MPO, TNF-\u03b1 and MMP-9 detectable in patient samples. 19, 66 Critically, the organisms' immunoevasive ability causes chronic airway inflammation which in turn correlates with poorer health status and lung function. 67, 68 Moraxella catarrhalis, the second most prevalent colonizing organism in stable COPD (seen in 2-22.5%), has been shown in previous studies to be linked to a heightened airway inflammation (IL-8, TNF-\u03b1 and NE). 18, 22, 69 In contrast to NTHi, 70 this bacterium is cleared after a relatively short colonization period and the development of immune responses that are protective against the homologous strain. 54 Streptococcus pneumoniae is another important bacterial organism (7.5-17%) in stable COPD. 22 Its polysaccharide capsule reduces the effectiveness of host defence mechanisms, which normally cause its clearance, leading to its airway persistence and colonization. In turn, this is associated with increased exacerbations, emphysema, lower diffusion capacity and pneumonia. 71 The role of P. aeruginosa in COPD pathogenesis is underscored by its frequent isolation in patients with more severe disease. 67, 72 Two types of Pseudomonasrelated infection are described in the COPD setting: short-term colonization followed by clearance and long-term persistent colonization. 73 Risk factors for Pseudomonas isolation in COPD include bronchiectasis, antibiotic exposure, previous hospitalization, steroid use and worse BODE index. 72 The mucoid phenotype is most likely to cause persistent colonization and, amongst P. aeruginosa-positive COPD patients, there is a significant association between colonization and disease severity. 73 Despite this, a nested case-control study comparing mortality showed no difference in relation to Pseudomonas status in stable COPD; however, in AECOPD, recent work has reaffirmed this organism's association with higher COPD mortality rates. 25, 74 Finally, chronic C. pneumoniae infection in COPD has been brought to light by a number of observational studies. Through its induction of a cytokine response (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IFN-\u03b1), airway inflammation and critical airway remodelling ensue. Prevalence varies widely (0-65%) likely attributable to the lack of samples collected, standardization in applied microbiological methodology and lack of diagnostic testing in routine use. 26, 75 Despite this, serum C. pneumoniae-specific IgG and IgA antibody levels are found in higher titres in COPD when compared with a control group. Furthermore, a statistically significant association between chronic C. pneumoniae infection and COPD has been established. 76 Employing combinations of both PCR and serological testing reveal that chronic C. pneumoniae infection is associated with more severe COPD, faster lung function declines and, importantly, exacerbations. 26 These relationships however are not clear cut as a separate study of 110 COPD patients showed no association between Chlamydia and either COPD exacerbation frequency or FEV 1 . 77 In this latter study, IgG titres were used to define chronic C. pneumoniae infection which may explain the observed disparity. Furthermore, it is likely that Chlamydia resides in the lower respiratory tract and sampling needs to occur from this site.

Fungal colonization is observed in severe COPD patients. Whether such colonization is a marker of advanced COPD or contributes to disease progression remains to be studied. Aspergillus spp. are frequently isolated from the airways of COPD patients during exacerbations (16.6%) and even during follow-up (14.1%). 29, 116 In an observational study, positive Aspergillus cultures in COPD patients were associated with increased sputum cell counts. 117 The incidence of AECOPD in the preceding year and concomitant bacterial pathogen isolation were associated with increased Aspergillus detection. Positive Aspergillus cultures in COPD patients are associated with increased sputum neutrophils suggesting the presence of host immune response in relation to the organism. 117 Up to 8-15% of COPD patients have hypersensitivity to Aspergillus, with associated reduced lung function. 118, 119 Whether the use of antifungals may mitigate such declines in pulmonary function remains to be studied. Isolation of Aspergillus in the airway may represent temporary passage, benign carriage or be an early sign of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), especially with high steroid use for recurrent exacerbations conferring host immunosuppression. Increasing evidence suggests that COPD patients are at risk of IPA with resulting high mortality rates; up to 22% of COPD patients with detection of Aspergillus in airway culture had IPA. 120 Innate immune responses play an important role in Aspergillus clearance mechanisms. Inhaled Aspergillus conidia bind to surface receptors within terminal airways via galactomannan, which enhance uptake by alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells leading to a cascade of immune responses. Recruitment of neutrophils and alveolar macrophages leads to ingestion, phagolysosomal degradation and killing of the fungal conidia. TLR2-and TLR4-dependent signals further contribute to host recognition and the inflammatory response to both Aspergillus conidia and hyphae. 121 Steroids therefore interfere with alveolar macrophage function, thereby increasing the risk of IPA through this and other defective innate immune responses in COPD including functionally abnormal neutrophils and TLRs. 122 Pneumocystis jirovecii is another opportunistic fungal pathogen of the COPD lung (8-85% of patients). [30] [31] [32] 123 Pneumocystis colonization is described in 36.7% of severe COPD patients (GOLD stage IV) compared with 5.3% of those with milder disease (GOLD stages 0-III).

This suggests that the organism is unlikely an innocent bystander and may contribute to disease pathogenesis and progression. An upregulation of chemokine ligands (CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11) of the CXCR3 receptor predominantly expressed on activated T-helper (Th) 1 lymphocytes is also observed and may prime Th1 inflammatory pathways contributing to the progression of COPD in these cases. 32", "cite_spans": [{"start": 415, "end": 418, "text": "29,", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 419, "end": 422, "text": "116", "ref_id": "BIBREF116"}, {"start": 548, "end": 551, "text": "117", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 870, "end": 873, "text": "117", "ref_id": "BIBREF117"}, {"start": 980, "end": 984, "text": "118,", "ref_id": "BIBREF118"}, {"start": 985, "end": 988, "text": "119", "ref_id": "BIBREF119"}, {"start": 1527, "end": 1530, "text": "120", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 2094, "end": 2097, "text": "121", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 2316, "end": 2319, "text": "122", "ref_id": "BIBREF122"}, {"start": 2422, "end": 2426, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2427, "end": 2431, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2432, "end": 2436, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 2437, "end": 2440, "text": "123", "ref_id": "BIBREF123"}, {"start": 2681, "end": 2684, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2685, "end": 2688, "text": "124", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Fungal infection and colonization"}, {"text": "Although respiratory viruses are associated with asthma and COPD and cause acute cell damage, release of ROS and activation of NF-\u03baB, their significance in stable COPD is less well understood (Table 1) .

[133] [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] While most research has focused on the bacteriome, viruses (virome) and fungi (mycobiome) are also important constituents of the microbiome. The respiratory tract contains genetic material from eukaryotic viruses such as anelloviruses, herpesviruses and papillomaviruses, as well as retroviruses that may establish persistent asymptomatic infections and bacteriophages, which dominate the virome. [142] [143] [144] [145] In the lung, the virome is highly variable between individuals and is strongly influenced by environmental conditions such as oxygen availability. 144 Unfortunately, in many studies, a large proportion of sequencing reads are not matched to a reference genome and it is unclear whether the identified viruses are commensal or a latent infection. Given these difficulties, it is challenging to directly compare the entire virome in COPD patients and healthy subjects. Nevertheless, COPD patients have increased total viral load, as well as an increased prevalence or abundance of influenza, cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus. [146] [147] [148] Ultimately, the role of acute viral infection including rhinovirus, RSV and influenza, which clearly contribute to inflammation, pathology and exacerbations of COPD, 28, 149, 150 remains to be fully elucidated. As previously described, latent adenoviral infection is associated with increased inflammation and alveolar destruction 126 while total and influenza-specific viral loads of COPD patients without symptoms of infection correlated with inflammatory cell numbers in the airways. 148 Moreover, human rhinovirus-encoded proteinase 2a has been proposed to elicit a duel Th1/Th2 response in COPD patients through its impact on dendritic cell maturation, thereby driving inflammation, allergy and airway obstruction. 149 Although fungi are only detectable at low abundance in healthy individuals, several members of the mycobiome are consistently identified in the lower respiratory tract, including Cladosporium and Aspergillus spp. 120, 151 Moreover, the outgrowth of Aspergillus can lead to IPA, with COPD as the most common predisposing condition. Colonization with Pneumocystis was associated with COPD development and GOLD stage classification. 30, 152 Pneumocystis spp. are capable of inducing COPD-like disease in animal models both with and without cigarette smoke exposure. 153, 154 In the oral cavity, smoking is associated with increased prevalence of Candida spp. as a consequence of the ability of cigarette smoke to increase the growth, adherence and immunostimulatory activity of Candida albicans. 155, 156 Cigarette smoke also increased the content of chitin in the cell wall of C. albicans. While it is not clear whether cigarette smoke causes similar changes in fungi that colonize the lung or if fungi in the oral cavity affect the lung through microaspiration, notably, the activity of chitotriosidase and the chitin-binding protein YKL-40 are increased in the BAL and alveolar macrophages of COPD patients. 157, 158 Even serum levels of YKL-40 and chitotriosidase are elevated in COPD patients and inversely correlate with lung function, indicating that host responses to fungal colonization may contribute to COPD progression. 159 The bacterial microbiome, virome and mycobiome are not isolated and act in concert. Indeed, bacteria and phage populations are strongly correlated, 142,144 while eukaryotic viruses and fungi can affect bacterial growth. 150, 151 Furthermore, the gastrointestinal microbiome interacts with the respiratory microbiota and plays a critical role in the development of several chronic respiratory diseases, and likely COPD (Fig. 3) . 133 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 136, "end": 141, "text": "[133]", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 142, "end": 147, "text": "[134]", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 148, "end": 153, "text": "[135]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 154, "end": 159, "text": "[136]", "ref_id": "BIBREF136"}, {"start": 160, "end": 165, "text": "[137]", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 166, "end": 171, "text": "[138]", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 172, "end": 177, "text": "[139]", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 178, "end": 183, "text": "[140]", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 184, "end": 189, "text": "[141]", "ref_id": "BIBREF141"}, {"start": 587, "end": 592, "text": "[142]", "ref_id": "BIBREF142"}, {"start": 593, "end": 598, "text": "[143]", "ref_id": "BIBREF143"}, {"start": 599, "end": 604, "text": "[144]", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 605, "end": 610, "text": "[145]", "ref_id": "BIBREF145"}, {"start": 758, "end": 761, "text": "144", "ref_id": "BIBREF144"}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1246, "text": "[146]", "ref_id": "BIBREF146"}, {"start": 1247, "end": 1252, "text": "[147]", "ref_id": "BIBREF147"}, {"start": 1253, "end": 1258, "text": "[148]", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1428, "text": "28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1429, "end": 1433, "text": "149,", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 1434, "end": 1437, "text": "150", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1749, "text": "148", "ref_id": "BIBREF148"}, {"start": 1979, "end": 1982, "text": "149", "ref_id": "BIBREF149"}, {"start": 2196, "end": 2200, "text": "120,", "ref_id": "BIBREF120"}, {"start": 2201, "end": 2204, "text": "151", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 2413, "end": 2416, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2417, "end": 2420, "text": "152", "ref_id": "BIBREF152"}, {"start": 2546, "end": 2550, "text": "153,", "ref_id": "BIBREF153"}, {"start": 2551, "end": 2554, "text": "154", "ref_id": "BIBREF154"}, {"start": 2776, "end": 2780, "text": "155,", "ref_id": "BIBREF155"}, {"start": 2781, "end": 2784, "text": "156", "ref_id": "BIBREF156"}, {"start": 3191, "end": 3195, "text": "157,", "ref_id": "BIBREF157"}, {"start": 3196, "end": 3199, "text": "158", "ref_id": "BIBREF158"}, {"start": 3412, "end": 3415, "text": "159", "ref_id": "BIBREF159"}, {"start": 3636, "end": 3640, "text": "150,", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}, {"start": 3641, "end": 3644, "text": "151", "ref_id": "BIBREF151"}, {"start": 3845, "end": 3848, "text": "133", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 3834, "end": 3842, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "THE ROLE OF THE MICROBIOME IN COPD PATHOGENESIS AND PROGRESSION"}, {"text": "The prominent role of bacteria in inciting acute COPD exacerbations has placed antibiotics at the forefront of COPD therapy.

[175] [176] [177] [178] Similarly, the risk for developing TB while on ICS therapy is significant in moderately to highly TB endemic areas. Research in Taiwan and South Korea has demonstrated up to 25 times greater risk of developing TB while on ICS treatment, with a dose-dependent effect. 179 Thus, in endemic areas, clinicians should be vigilant for the development of TB in COPD patients on ICS therapy. In addition to geographical distinctions, infection is not uniform in COPD, with changes in pathogen, strain and load over time. 16, 18 Different species trigger distinct inflammatory responses. 67 Furthermore, host factors play an essential role in infection manifestation and outcome. This results in variable response to antibiotic treatments in COPD. Therapy such as long-term macrolides can be beneficial with reductions in exacerbation rates in a selected group of patients with COPD. 180 This effect has been linked to antiinflammatory properties of macrolides likely explained by their impact on the microbiome, which, in turn, modulates immune tone. Culture-independent molecular techniques have constructed a comprehensive analysis of the microbial community in the lower airway and yet how the complexities in interactions between the host, pathogen and the environment contribute to disease manifestation and progression in COPD is far from understood.

Pulsed therapies of antibiotics are frequently used to control bacterial multiplication, which consequently promotes the development of antimicrobial resistance. Prolonged use of macrolides for the prophylaxis and treatment of COPD exacerbations has been shown to increase antimicrobial drug resistance in H. influenzae. 184 The commonly used drug azithromycin has a long half-life of around 66 h, which can lead to drug concentrations below the minimum inhibitory concentration for an extended period of time. 185 This prolonged exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the drug may be one of the reasons behind the increased resistance to macrolides. Indeed, a study by Desai et al. on COPD patients with S. pneumoniae infection showed a correlation between exposure to macrolides and development of resistance. 186 They advised for the use of alternative antibiotics in patients who have been taking macrolides in the previous 6 months. 186 A 15-year longitudinal study conducted by Pettigrew et al. concluded that fluoroquinolones represent the best choice for eradicating H. influenzae in COPD patients. 184 In their study, none of the bacterial isolates developed resistance to fluoroquinolones. 184 Even though P. aeruginosa is a relatively uncommon cause of COPD exacerbations, its incidence is on the rise and the rapid emergence and spread of MDR (defined by resistance to at least three antibiotic classes) is a serious cause for concern. A comparative study conducted in Spain has demonstrated that the carriage of MDR P. aeruginosa in COPD patients was associated with increased mortality rates and more recent work in AECOPD reveals a high burden of antibiotic resistance. 25, 187 The lung environment found in COPD patients is also favourable to the formation of biofilms, a mechanism by which bacteria, particularly P. aeruginosa and H. influenza, evade antibiotic killing. In addition to limiting antimicrobial penetration, the biofilm triggers the emergence of relatively quiescent bacteria that become phenotypically drug resistant to most antibiotics, therefore increasing their persistence for prolonged periods of time. 188 Currently, the most effective way of curbing antimicrobial resistance is to reduce the use of antibiotics by prescribing them only to patients with demonstrated pathological bacterial infection. In this respect, the use of sensitive markers of bacterial infection such as procalcitonin to guide the start of antibiotic therapy was shown to significantly reduce the use of antibiotics in COPD patients. 189 There is also the potential that the new therapies developed for steroid-resistant asthma may also be beneficial in COPD and possibly avoid the infection-inducing effects of ICS. 190", "cite_spans": [{"start": 441, "end": 444, "text": "184", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 631, "end": 634, "text": "185", "ref_id": "BIBREF186"}, {"start": 937, "end": 940, "text": "186", "ref_id": "BIBREF187"}, {"start": 1063, "end": 1066, "text": "186", "ref_id": "BIBREF187"}, {"start": 1232, "end": 1235, "text": "184", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 1325, "end": 1328, "text": "184", "ref_id": "BIBREF185"}, {"start": 1810, "end": 1813, "text": "25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1817, "text": "187", "ref_id": "BIBREF188"}, {"start": 2265, "end": 2268, "text": "188", "ref_id": "BIBREF189"}, {"start": 2671, "end": 2674, "text": "189", "ref_id": "BIBREF190"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Emerging antimicrobial resistance in COPD: implications for disease pathogenesis and progression"}, {"text": "The majority of studies described above are of the associations between infections and microbiomes with COPD in humans.

The question of whether colonizing microbes actively contribute to COPD pathogenesis and more importantly progression may be difficult to address with the current evidence base, given technical challenges in detecting these organisms and the subtlety of their association with disease over long periods of time. Nevertheless, immune responses observed in stable and colonized COPD patients reflect the corollary of those seen in AECOPD supporting a role for microbial colonization in COPD pathogenesis most likely through a perpetuation of negative immune responses over time. Initial work has started to uncover changes in the lung microbiome associated with the COPD state and may reveal further variables to be considered in the investigation of microbe-COPD interactions. The parallel use of mouse models and interrogation of human samples ex vivo and in primary cell culture will likely progress mechanistic insights and drug development. Importantly, however, other variables of microbiome composition may confound pathogen-centric investigations of disease-microbe interactions and it is likely that large-scale studies will be required to address the current gaps in our knowledge of bacterial, viral and fungal microbiota and their association with COPD. Precipitous drops in the costs of DNA sequencing, coupled with the technological innovations in metagenomics, may soon bring such technology into the realm of routine diagnostics in COPD. This could allow for refined patient phenotyping and stratification that in turn will allow more focused and personalized therapy based on microbiology.
