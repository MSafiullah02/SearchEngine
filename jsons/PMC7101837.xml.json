            "text": "Mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains high at approximately 40 %, and it is unclear whether there has been a significant reduction in ICU mortality over the last decade [1, 2]. The mortality in children appears to be lower, at 10\u201340 % [3]. Ventilatory strategies for ARDS continue to evolve, with emphasis on protective lung strategy and low tidal volume ventilation based on the landmark 2000 ARMA trial [4]. Several modes of ventilation have been advocated, including high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) [5\u20139]. Prospective clinical trials on HFOV for ARDS have been inconsistent, although recent meta-analyses suggested that HFOV may improve survival and is unlikely to cause harm in ARDS patients [10, 11]. A multicenter pediatric crossover study did show that HFOV was associated with higher mean airway pressures (Paw), improved oxygenation, and a reduced need for supplemental oxygen at 30 days [12]. Furthermore, a neonatal randomized controlled trial demonstrated lower mortality in very-low-birth-weight babies managed with HFOV [13]. Our large tertiary-care children\u2019s hospital has been utilizing HFOV for a decade as rescue therapy for patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) in accordance with a permissive ventilation protocol. Our study was undertaken to evaluate the utilization of HFOV in AHRF and to determine variables associated with survival and prognostic indicators.",

The eight patients excluded because of fatal head injuries all had recovery of lung function and were weaned off HFOV, so the \u201csuccess rate\u201d could be viewed as higher if these patients are included. We believe our permissive ventilation guidelines are similar to those of other PICUs, although some may utilize higher PEEP before employing HFOV. We also recognize our unit has a bias toward early HFOV for AHRF. Some of this comes from the difficulty with ventilating infants with low tidal volumes when their intrinsic respiratory rates are high. It is much easier to increase an adult\u2019s intrinsic rate threefold on conventional ventilation and still have a set respiratory rate of only 30 rather than 60\u2013100 needed in an infant.",

A single previous study attributed the success of HFOV in bronchiolitis to its use for hypercapnia rather than hypoxemia [19]. However, the bronchiolitis patients in our study received HFOV for hypoxemia or hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Although 64 % of our patients with bronchiolitis had underlying bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the overall survival rate was still 93 %. We made no attempt to separate patients with RSV and HMPV bronchiolitis from those with the pneumonia. Most patients with standard bronchiolitis during the study period were managed with conventional ventilation and did not develop AHRF. In our experience there is a spectrum of disease and those who develop AHRF generally have bronchoalveolar disease. Additionally, patients diagnosed with pneumonia (viral or bacterial) who were treated with HFOV also had statistically improved survival. Both of these groups of patients showed early and sustained improvement in oxygenation when placed on HFOV. Our study supports the idea that HFOV limits volutrauma in obstructive and alveolar lung disease, making these patients optimal candidates for HFOV support. Limiting ventilator-induced lung injury, as others have described with HFOV [20], may have also played an important role in these patients.",

Other pediatric studies have also found that pulmonary-specific markers (OI and FiO2/PaO2) are associated with mortality in patients with AHRF [21\u201324]. Patients who did not show improvement in OI in the first 12 h on HFOV did not survive. Conversely, patients with sustained improvement in oxygenation while on HFOV survived. An OI of >35 at 24 h predicted mortality with an OR of 31.11. This predictive OR is lower than previously reported values in patients treated with HFOV [12]. Most mortality in our PICU setting was due to circulatory failure or MODS rather than hypoxemia. Nonetheless, a lower OI in the first hours of HFOV support may portend improved survival. Monitoring OI while utilizing HFOV is critical because this formula includes a critical component of HFOV settings, the Paw. It is clear that patients who respond to the higher Paw generated by HFOV with sustained improvement in PO2 are most likely to survive.",

Subgroup analysis of survival of patients with sepsis showed that the rate was slightly lower than that of the overall group. Survivors in this subgroup demonstrated improvement in oxygenation and metabolic acidosis and required a lower dose of epinephrine within 4 h of going on HFOV. We suspect improvement in gas exchange resulted in stabilization of MODS and hastened resolution of circulatory failure. Previous work has also shown that proinflammatory cytokines are reduced with HFOV, so this may be a contributing factor [25].",

Some may question the use of HFOV, which utilizes high intrathoracic pressures and minimizes suctioning, in bronchiolitis. In spite of this potential for thick secretions, small airway obstruction, and air trapping, we found no difference in the incidence of pneumothorax when comparing bronchiolitis patients to patients with other diagnoses. We recognize that ECMO criteria consider the OI and the Pa/FiO2 ratio when selecting candidates and since our PICU was not an ECMO center at the time of this study, a bias toward aggressive use of HFOV may exist. Due to the retrospective nature of our study, we chose to classify patients as having AHRF rather than trying to assign each patient the diagnosis of ARDS. Other studies have described the challenges and potential errors in diagnosing ARDS [26\u201329]. Finally, we cannot say with absolute certainty that the ventilation guidelines were completely followed on each and every patient as this was not a prospective study. However, our review of the respiratory therapy charting suggested they were.",

Disease-specific morbidity associated with AHRF appears to predict better survival rates on HFOV, particularly favoring pulmonary disease states such as bronchiolitis and/or pneumonia. Early and sustained improvement in OI predicts survival, and circulatory failure requiring higher dosing of epinephrine in early HFOV predicts increased mortality. Larger randomized controlled studies are still needed to confirm optimal patient selection criteria for HFOV.",
