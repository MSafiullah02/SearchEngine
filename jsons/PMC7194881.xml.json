As of April 10, 2020, the Indian Council of Medical Research designated 146 government testing laboratories and 67 private laboratories for COVID-19 testing.3 On March 24, 2020, a countrywide lockdown was announced and went into effect immediately. This lockdown was abrupt and resulted in a mass exodus of 120 million individuals (mostly migrant and seasonal laborers).4 This mass exodus has been compared to the partition of India wherein, 14\u201315 million individuals were displaced. Results from this mass exodus in terms of COVID-19 transmission or infections in rural areas (where access to healthcare services tends to be far less than urban areas), may likely result in not only overwhelming the fragile and fragmented healthcare system but also pushing them into poverty and starvation.",

The number of pharmacists - clinical and staff, working in hospitals have increased steadily in the past decade with the advent of the Pharm.D program and due to hospital accreditation requirements. Lacunae in pharmacy education, training, and lack of resolution around pharmacist roles present challenges in providing health services to patients. This lack of differentiation creates challenges around role specifications and appropriate placement of clinically trained Pharmacy Professionals (PP) along with challenges of their incorporation in Emergency Preparedness & Response (EP&R).",

India's pharmaceutical manufacturing sector was directed to increase the output of these drugs to meet surges in demand.
