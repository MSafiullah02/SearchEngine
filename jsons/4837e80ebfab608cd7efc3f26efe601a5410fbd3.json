In Wuhan, the imposed lockdown resulted in travel restrictions to and from Wuhan to ensure rigorous adherence to home quarantine. Social distancing was practiced by canceling events and gatherings, closing of public places as well as schools and universities. Additionally, outside activities were extremely limited since every citizen was given a permission card and only allowed to leave their home every second day for a maximum of 30 minutes. Despite this rigorous enforcement launched by China to contain COVID-19 spread, total case numbers have significantly increased in China as well as internationally. These developments transform the current COVID-19 outbreak into a global pandemic.",

However, lockdown measures and confinement raise serious concerns in the population, as they are distant memory of a tainted European past, dating back to sieges of cities in the middle ages and bubonic plague outbreaks.

This has already been confirmed in figure 1. Therefore, a correlation between the air traffic and the distribution of COVID-19 was calculated using the least square regression line.

When interpreting the observed changes in doubling time all measures imposed in Wuhan must be considered. Our data cannot differentiate which of the stringent measures were most successful, as our analyses only assessed the efficacy of the totality of these measures. The totality of these measures was partially successful and have resulted in a delayed COVID-19 spread in China. Currently, international cases have already outnumbered reported cases in China; therefore, containment of a global COVID-19 spread seems unfeasible. Although a doubling time of 19 days is overserved in the latest interval, the reasons behind this observation remain difficult to discern.",

While measurable effects were achieved by the described lockdown efforts in the Hubei province, more attention should be directed toward the new epicenters outside of China in order to slow down COVID-19 spread. As Wilder-Smith et al. have already pointed out, early measurements are needed to contain or at least significantly slow down the virus' spread. Yet, due to political and economic considerations, the degree of transparency in reporting and efforts in detecting COVID-19 cases as well as the willingness to implement countermeasures drastically varies from country to country. A basic reproductive number (R 0 ) had been estimated based on different models ranging from 2.2-3.9 12, 13 . However, these numbers only make sense in their respective context and it is recommended not to compare values based on different models. R 0 numbers show variations as they depend on multiple factors, including number of susceptible individuals exposed to infected COVID-19 patients. A recently conducted, very small-scale study on COVID-19 estimated a serial interval of 4-5 days, therefore suggesting that a substantial proportion of secondary transmission may occur prior to illness onset 14 .",
