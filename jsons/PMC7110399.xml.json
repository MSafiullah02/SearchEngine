Globalization means that physical distance from outbreaks of zoonotic diseases\u2014even distances spanning half the globe\u2014can no longer be considered a safeguard against infection from those diseases. The unexpected resurgence in human deaths from H5N1 avian influenza in Vietnam and Thailand during August and September 2004 and the first evidence of direct human-to-human transmission of this potentially deadly zoonotic disease clearly demonstrate the need for international cooperation and collaboration in the identification, monitoring, and control of zoonotic diseases around the globe.",

The globalization of industrial livestock production and the rapidly expanding international trade in animals and animal products from wild and domesticated species are fostering the emergence and global proliferation of new zoonotic diseases with the ability to pass between and among humans, wildlife, and domesticated animals. Recent increases in the emergence and proliferation of pathogens are being driven by human transformations of natural landscapes for agriculture and livestock production, human selection through indiscriminate or inappropriate uses of antibiotics, deliberate and accidental introductions of exotic invasive alien species, and a $6 billion global trade in exotic animals and plants.",

Diseases like tuberculosis and polio, which were once thought susceptible to global eradication, are reclaiming lost ground, while viral diseases of humans and animals are evolving new strains that go undetected and thus thwart regional and global vaccination programs. The ancient scourges of anthrax and plague are proliferating once again in areas of Africa and Asia beset by drought, poverty, war, and civil strife.",

The 2003\u20132004 avian influenza pandemic in Asia was unprecedented in its severity and geographic scope, with exceptionally high virulence in avian as well as human populations. Death rates among confirmed human victims of the H5N1 avian influenza virus in Vietnam and Thailand (> 70 percent mortality) are comparable to those reported among human cases of the Ebola virus in central Africa and Nipah virus in Bangladesh. Emerging and endemic zoonotic diseases are demonstrably no longer a safely distant, third-world health phenomenon. The past several years have seen an astounding resurgence of zoonotic diseases as public health threats in the United States, including ",

The anthrax \u201cletter bomb\u201d attacks of September\u2013October 2001 demonstrated the critical need for recognizing that zoonotic disease surveillance and information systems are important elements of our public health and homeland security infrastructure, the nation's first line of defense and response against terrorist attacks involving bioweapon diseases (Dudley 2003). The deliberate or accidental release of weaponized disease pathogens could have devastating direct effects on biodiversity and agricultural productivity\u2014and possibly even more devastating indirect effects on wildlife, including some endangered species, should these become targeted for extirpation because they could become reservoirs or vectors of bioweapon disease pathogens.",
