Currently addressing the German market with the prototype, we have crawled and indexed press releases from the German press portal Blaulicht. In our evaluation, we compare different strategies of formulating search queries given a URL. In a TREC-style setup [5] on 105 topics covering 7 classes of police-related events, we show that even the most simple querying strategy (searching the title of the news article in the titles and bodies of the press releases) substantially outperforms the search facility offered by the press portal itself.
