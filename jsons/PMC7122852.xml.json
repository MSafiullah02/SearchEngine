Most research falls into two categories: (1) incremental research (i.e. research that builds on existing knowledge) or (2) replication of work that has been done previously. Manuscripts dealing with incremental research are considered more important, since these advance science, i.e. they improve our understanding of a disease or its treatment.

But journal editors are not always interested in manuscripts based on work carried out in previous studies. A replication study on a topic of recent or current global interest might be accepted in a top- or medium-level journal as their readers are interested in looking for articles that deal with similar problems from all over the world. However, once many articles on a particular topic have been published, new ones are considered less favourably, unless they have a new message. These may evince greater interest if a very different population group is reported on, and particularly if your results differ from those recorded in, previous papers. Hence, you need to choose a journal, based on how much similar work has already been published, by descending an informal pecking order of journals in the field if there are already many replicative publications.",

However, there is always the possibility that the findings or reasoning followed in such original work will turn out to be unfounded and fail to influence science in the long run. Innovative work often challenges existing knowledge and dogmas and may face resistance from peers. An element of chance operates for such papers. If the work is perceived as novel and is appreciated by the peer reviewers and the editorial team, it may be published in a high-impact journal, such as Science or Nature. For instance, the article describing the discovery of hepatitis C virus was published in Science [1]. On the other hand, the paper describing the discovery of Helicobacter pylori (then called Campylobacter pyloridis) was rejected as an original article. The report was published as a letter in The Lancet [2] in 1983; in 2005 the authors received the Nobel Prize for their work!",

It is worth remembering that though general medical journals have a wide readership, they may not be read by many specialists; hence their editors often do not encourage the publication of highly specialized papers. If your manuscript addresses a specialist topic, a specialist journal is more likely to publish it. Also, these journals are read by specialists; hence, if your paper addresses their interest, they are more likely to read it.",

However, over the years, it has been used not only to compare journals, but also to assess research outputs of individuals and institutions. These latter uses are clearly inappropriate; however, even as a measure of journal quality, the impact factor has a number of limitations. First, the impact factors vary widely between scientific disciplines and fields, so direct comparisons are not truly valid; for instance, journals in fast-moving areas such as immunology have much higher impact factors than those in traditional fields such as physiology. Second, review articles often receive a disproportionately large number of citations compared to original research; thus, journals with a large number of review articles tend to have higher impact factors. Furthermore, the number of citations varies greatly for different papers published in a particular journal, with a large proportion of articles receiving no citation; the use of arithmetic mean for such data is fraught with problems. Finally, the impact factors are subject to manipulation [5, 6].",
