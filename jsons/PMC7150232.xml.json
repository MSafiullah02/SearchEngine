Before the end of February 2003, a total of 11 index cases occurred independently in nine cities of Guangdong Province, which forms the early phase of the SARS epidemic.1 These index cases spread the virus to their close relatives and hospital staffs and provided the early demonstration of the respiratory transmission mode of the disease. The clinical symptoms of SARS are nonspecific. The index cases all began to have fever higher than 38\u00b0C and displayed common respiratory symptoms, such as cough, headache, and shortness of breath.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with the largest single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes currently known, ranging in size from 27 to nearly 32 kb in length. Coronaviruses can infect and cause disease in a broad array of avian and mammal species, including humans. The name \u201ccoronavirus\u201d is derived from the Greek word, meaning crown, as the virus envelope appears under electron microscopy to be crowned by a characteristic ring of small bulbous structures. Within the virion, the ssRNA genome is encased in a helical nucleocapsid composed of many copies of the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The lipid bilayer envelope contains three proteins: envelope (E) and membrane (M) protein, which coordinate virion assembly and release, and the large spike (S) protein, which confers the virus's characteristic corona shape as well as serves as the principal mediator of host cell attachment and entry via virus- and host-specific cell receptors. The size of the SARS-CoV viral particle is approximately 80\u201390 nm and its genomic size is around 29.7 kb.9, 10 The SARS-CoV genome contains 14 open reading frames (ORFs) flanked by 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions of 265 and 342 nucleotides, respectively. While all CoVs carry strain-specific accessory proteins encoded by their downstream ORFs, the order of essential genes\u2014the replicase/transcriptase gene, S gene, E gene, M gene, and N gene\u2014is highly conserved.11 Similar to other known coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV genome expression starts with two long open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which account for two-thirds of the genomic capacity, followed by ORFs encoding S, E, M, and N proteins (Fig. 26.1\n). In addition to these conserved core genes in coronaviruses, the SARS-CoV genome contains several accessory genes that are specific to SARS-CoV and their encoded products have no homologue to known proteins. Phylogenetic analysis based on the most conserved gene ORF1b indicated that SARS-CoV is distantly related to the group 2 coronaviruses (now the genus Betacoronavirus) in the family\nCoronaviridae, and represents a distinct cluster, named group 2b (now the genus Betacoronavirus group b; Fig. 26.2\n).12, 13\n",

One of the earliest and most important studies was conducted by a joint team from Hong Kong and Shenzhen in mainland China.14 In this investigation, out of 25 samples collected from market animals, SARS-CoV-like viruses were isolated from four out of six masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) and one raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides). Antibodies against SARS-CoV were detected in masked palm civets, raccoon dog, and Chinese ferret-badgers (Melogale moschata). Genome sequencing indicated that the viruses isolated from civets were almost identical to those from human, suggesting a highly possible zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV from animal(s) to human.14 These data indicated that at least three different animal species were infected by a coronavirus that is closely related to SARS-CoV. This important study provided the first direct evidence that SARS-CoV existed in animals, pointing to an animal link of the SARS outbreaks.",

Serological and molecular studies indicated that only civets in the markets were infected with SARS-CoV whereas the populations of civets in the wild or on farms were free of major infections.18, 22, 23 Civets produced overt clinical syndromes when experimentally infected with SARS-CoV.24 Comparative genome sequence analysis indicated that SARS-CoVs in civets experienced rapid mutation, suggesting that the viruses were still adapting to the host rather than persisting in equilibrium expected for viruses in their natural reservoir species.17, 25\n",

The majority of the mutations are located in the S1 domain (31 of a total of 48 SNVs), particularly in the RBD.1, 46 The interaction analysis between the S proteins of different isolates and the ACE2 molecules demonstrated that two aa residues in the S protein, aa 479 and aa 487, played a key role in virus infectivity.48, 49 For aa residue 479, all 2002\u20132003 human isolates contain asparagine (N). The palm civet isolates seem to have variable aa residues at this position, all 2002\u20132003 and some 2003\u20132004 civet isolates have lysine (K) while other 2003\u20132004 isolates have either asparagine (N) or arginine (R). For aa residue 487, all isolates including those from early- and middle-phase patients, civets of 2002\u20132003 and 2003\u20132004, have a codon for serine (S), whereas all isolates from 2002\u20132003 late-phase human patients have a codon for threonine (T) (Fig. 26.3). When examined using an HIV-based pseudovirus infection assay, S proteins with all combinations of residues 487/479 could efficiently use the civet ACE2 as an entry receptor, but showed different infectivity in human ACE2-mediated infection.48, 49 The combination of N479/T487 had the highest infectivity, N479/S487 medium infectivity, and K479/S487 the lowest, which almost abolished the infection. These results demonstrated elegantly at the molecular interface that the rapid evolution of the S protein, especially at the aa positions important for host receptor engagement, was essential for the adaptation to and establishment of an effective and productive human infection.",

As shown in Fig. 26.3, bat SL-CoVs can be grouped into three groups based on the RBM sequences. The strains discovered early are close to each other and have a major sequence difference involving deletions of 17\u201318 aa right in the middle of RBM. We have since demonstrated experimentally that SL-CoV S proteins are unable to use ACE2 molecule, regardless of its origin, as a functional receptor. The second group, identified from European bats, has deletions of 4 aa.32 The third group, discovered recently, has no deletion and contains an identical size as the SARS-CoV in the S protein (Fig. 26.3).31, 34, 35 As predicted from their S sequences, three isolates from the third group, SL-CoV\u2014WIV1, WIV16, and SHC014, have been shown to be able to use ACE2 for cellular entry, even though these S proteins still have slight difference at the key aa involved in direct interaction with ACE2.31, 34, 50 Most importantly, the SHC014 can replicate well in transgenic mice containing human ACE2, and it caused tissue damage in tested animals.50\n",

In general, pathogens carried by wildlife reservoir animals usually do not cause clinical symptoms and they lie dormant until they spill over into and cause diseases in domestic animals or humans.

Surveillance of wildlife animals has also been made more feasible and productive, thanks to the advance in modern molecular techniques including PCR with virus group-specific primers, virus discovery using next generation high-throughput sequencing technologies, and high density virus microarrays.56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63 Since the SARS outbreaks, especially after the discovery of SL-CoVs in bats, there is a significant surge in international effort for surveillance of coronaviruses in wildlife animals. Before the SARS outbreak, there were only 10 coronaviruses with complete genomes sequenced. This number has increased more than sixfold as a result of the active surveillance works conducted around the world.27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34, 40, 55, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73 Although this only marks the beginning of our understanding of coronaviruses in wildlife animals, it is fair to say that we have learnt a lot more about coronaviruses in general than the past 50 years or so; during that period studying of viruses was only possible and called for in response to disease outbreaks. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the large number of bat coronavirus sequences available presently, it is postulated that all known disease-causing coronaviruses previously identified in humans or animals originated from bat strains.31, 34, 43, 55 This hypothesis was unfortunately proved by the outbreak of another SARS-like disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which was caused by a novel coronavirus (previously named HCoV-EMC, now MERS-CoV) and supposed to originate from bats.74 Even though the MERS-CoV-like viruses found in bats are not the direct progenitor of the MERS-CoV, the highly genetic diversity of these bat viruses is likely the gene sources for the deadly pathogen in humans, just like that for SARS-CoV.71, 72, 75, 76, 77\n",

It served as a warning to what may come out of a seemingly harmless virus\u2013reservoir equilibrium in bats or any other wildlife species. At the same time, the experience gained from the SARS outbreaks and the following in-depth studies on SARS-like coronaviruses has provided and will continue to provide invaluable knowledge and guideline to our future fight against new and emerging infectious diseases. One of the major lessons is that we need to pay much more attention to the reservoir species in understanding the genetic diversity of different viruses, the intricate interplay at the virus\u2013host interface, and the major factors responsible for the disturbance of virus\u2013host equilibrium, which in turn trigger spillover events leading to disease outbreaks.",
