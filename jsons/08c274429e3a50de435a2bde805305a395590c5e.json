Due to sustained and widespread human-to-human transmission, the World Health Organization raised the pandemic alert level from phase 5 to 6 on 11 June 2009. Unlike seasonal influenza, people below 60 years of age were infected preferentially worldwide [World Health Organization, 2009] , with unusually high rate of severe respiratory disease and mortality among young patients in Mexico [Chowell et al., 2009] . This phenomenon may be attributed to the lack of pre-existing cross-reactive antibody against pandemic H1N1 virus in this age group [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009 ]. On the contrary, most if not all of these individuals have pre-existing antibody against the prevailing seasonal influenza virus. Apart from cross reactive antibody level, viral load profile from different body sites is also important in predicting disease severity and transmissibility in viral infections [Hayden et al., 1998; Chu et al., 2004; Hung et al., 2004; Cheng et al., 2004a; de Jong et al., 2006; Lowen et al., 2009] . The correlation between the virological profile and clinical characteristics of pandemic H1N1 virus infection would provide important knowledge for epidemiological control and clinical management in terms of antiviral therapy and infection control measures.",

Briefly, 2 ml eluted RNA of Influenza A virus was used for cDNA by Invitrogen Superscript II Kit with random primer as described, and then, cDNA was amplified in Lightcycler instrument with a FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I Mix reagent kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). In a typical reaction, 2 ml cDNA was amplified in a 20 ml of LC-PCR master mix containing 1\u00c2 Fast-Start DNA master SYBR green I mix, 4.0 mM MgCl 2 , 0.5 mM of each primer.

Peak mean viral load occurred early during illness in both pandemic H1N1 virus and seasonal influenza virus infection, similar to studies in human volunteers [Hayden et al., 1998 ]. For patients who presented to hospital between days 0 and 3 after onset of symptoms, the initial pre-treatment viral load in pandemic H1N1 cases was lower than the seasonal influenza historical controls. This might be explained by differences in the severity of illness. Less upper respiratory tract and gastrointestinal symptoms were found in the pandemic H1N1 cases, since they were hospitalized despite mild symptoms during the containment phase of pandemic control in Hong Kong. Many cases were transferred directly from the airport to hospitals either because of their onset of symptoms during the flight or were found to have fever by body temperature screening upon arrival at the airport. Moreover, respiratory specimens were taken from every patient with suspected pandemic H1N1 virus infection independent of severity of symptoms or underlying diseases, whereas in non-pandemic period, only a minority of patients with seasonal influenza virus infection who attended hospital service had respiratory specimen collected for virological diagnosis. As a result, these patients selected randomly as historical controls were likely to have more severe symptoms or with chronic underlying illnesses, which were associated with a higher initial pre-treatment viral load at diagnosis.",

However, significant viral shedding, up to 6 log 10 copies/ml, was still present 6 days after onset of symptoms. In addition, younger age correlated with longer periods of viral shedding. This finding was similar to the previous studies in seasonal influenza virus infection, in which viral load was generally low or undetectable by day 5 of illness, but could persist for up to 21 days in children [World Health Organization Writing Group, 2006 ]. Viral load was found to be especially high in young children [Hall et al., 1979] . A more prolonged shedding could also occur in immunocompromised patients. Antiviral therapy was also proven to reduce viral shedding for seasonal influenza [Hayden et al., 1999; Boivin et al., 2003; Ward et al., 2004] . However, since most of the patients in this series received oseltamivir, the effect of antiviral therapy for this novel strain could not be determined. Further studies involving patients without oseltamivir therapy would be necessary to assess the impact of antiviral treatment on viral shedding and clinical outcomes. Pandemic H1N1 virus was detected in the stool of four patients, with positive viral culture from the specimen with the highest viral load. Previous studies showed that human influenza A H5N1 virus could be detected in stool [Buchy et al., 2007] , and this virus was further demonstrated in the biopsy of the small and large intestine of fatal cases [Uiprasertkul et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2009] . Other respiratory viruses that have been found in stool include SARS coronavirus , respiratory syncytial virus [von Linstow et al., 2006] , adenovirus [Wilhelmi et al., 2003] and bocavirus [Lau et al., 2007] . Seasonal influenza virus detection by RT-PCR in stool has only been reported in very young children between the age of 5 weeks and 9 months, but positive viral culture has not been reported [Wootton et al., 2006] . The finding that fecal shedding occurred in patients with pandemic H1N1 virus infection highlights the importance of contact precaution when handling stool. This is especially important for younger children as they have higher viral loads in stool.",

Viremia, which has been observed in blood donors without symptoms, is a recognized although uncommon phenomenon in seasonal influenza [Zou, 2006; Likos et al., 2007] . In influenza A H5N1 virus infection, serum level had prognostic significance [de Jong et al., 2006] . This study has several limitations. The viral load in different types of respiratory specimens might be affected by the method of collection. Nasopharyngeal aspirate is considered as the gold standard in obtaining nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. However, nasopharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal flocked swab and nosethroat swabs have been suggested as alternatives because of high sensitivity [Frayha et al., 1989; Lambert et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2008a] . For patients with influenza A virus infection, the quantity of virus was not significantly different between nasopharyngeal aspirate and nasopharyngeal flocked swab [Chan et al., 2008a] . The analysis of serial viral changes might also be affected by the absence of specimens on consecutive days. Since obtaining respiratory specimens was associated with discomfort, many patients refused daily specimen collection once their symptoms improved.",

Since prolonged shedding may occur despite oseltamivir therapy, routine infection control measures should also be enforced during at risk period to prevent outbreaks in institutions.",
