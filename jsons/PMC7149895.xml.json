The carrier had just two 737s and planned on cautious growth, with the goal of being profitable by the third year. It was a modest beginning for a company intended to become Malaysia's second national airline after flag carrier Malaysia Airlines, but it had no choice but to be circumspect given the severe constraints placed on AirAsia's growth. Malaysia's transport minister, who was aboard the first flight, made clear that there would be no direct competition between AirAsia\u2014which initially flew under the brand Pacific Eagle\u2014and Malaysia Airlines. Indeed, more than a year before AirAsia's first flight, Malaysia Airlines\u2019 chairman was quoted in the country's main newspaper saying, \u201cWe go out and search for the routes, and the ones we have identified, we operate them. Of course we are reluctant to give them up.\u201d (quoted in Azmi, 1995). And thus the opening to Pattaya, a secondary Thai gateway to which the larger airline did not operate.",

Within months of its launch in 1996, the economies of Thailand, Indonesia, and then Malaysia were sent spiraling downward by the Asian Financial Crisis. And then a week after its purchase by Tune Air, the attacks of September 11, 2001 sent a shockwave through the global economy and especially the global airline industry. Yet these successive crises helped spur the government of Malaysia and other Asian economies to loosen their control over aviation, and AirAsia rapidly expanded into the spaces created by deregulation. By early 2002, the airline was dealing with a \u201cdeluge of inquiries\u201d about its services between Kuala Lumpur and other major Malaysian cities including Penang\u2014routes already served by national carrier Malaysian Airlines (Singh & Maria, 2002).",

More specifically, like LCCs elsewhere, AirAsia slashed its turnaround time, took advantage of the nascent Internet to lower marketing and distribution costs, encouraged multitasking personnel, adopted a single aircraft type (the 737), and did some ancillary services (e.g., ground handling) in-house (Khanna, 2003). By 2003, the airline's costs were among the lowest in the world: USD 0.025 per available seat-kilometer versus USD 0.042 for Ryanair (Khanna, 2003) and less than half the level of Malaysia Airlines (O\u2019Connell & Williams, 2005).",

Getting from Singapore to Senai required two bus trips and clearing immigration, but the low fares made it an attractive option: five reporters for the Singapore Straits Times tested which was the best way to get from the Esplanade in downtown Singapore to Kuala Lumpur's famed Petronas Towers (Loh, 2003). A nonstop shuttle flight on Singapore Airlines (SIA) between the city-state\u2019s Changi Airport and Kuala Lumpur International was fastest at just 4 hours and 10 minutes including ground transportation time, but cost the most\u2014SGD 417.60 (USD 240). Conversely, taking the AirAsia flight out of Senai slashed the cost to SGD 27.70 (USD 16) but took nearly 7 hours. The AirAsia option was made more attractive by introductory promotional fares but even at the LCC's regular fare on the route, the circuitous route through Senai was competitive with the cost of driving one's own car, taking the train, or traveling by bus between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.",

As an interim measure, Indonesia AirAsia served the Singapore market via the nearby Indonesian island of Batam (Kaur, 2005), much as AirAsia had done in Senai.

A particularly important and long-awaited development in that regard was the opening of the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur market to new competitors. Long one of the world's most heavily trafficked routes, the link had been a virtual duopoly for decades. The air service agreement governing the route gave almost all traffic rights to SIA and Malaysia Airlines, and those carriers in turn split all revenue (regardless of which carrier moved which passenger) 50-50 (Kaur, 2007). SIA and MAS had an 85% combined market share on the route in advance of its liberalization, and roundtrip fares for the 300-km route were about USD 290. But as part of the more general liberalization of aviation in ASEAN, new competitors were allowed on the route from February 1, 2008, and AirAsia was among them. It entered the route with two roundtrips a day and fares of about USD 75.",

It was created by an entrepreneurial family with interests in a variety of industries (from chopsticks to jewelry) and with strong political connections (a co-founder later becomes parliament speaker). And like Lion Air, Adam Air enjoyed meteoric growth in Indonesia's buoyant aviation sector. But Adam Air was beset by safety concerns that undermined and eventually terminated its growth. In 2006, one of its jets got lost en route over Java and then meandered for hours before making an emergency landing 4 hours later on the wrong island. In January 2007, another jet crashed into the sea off Sulawesi with 102 people on board (Osman, 2008a). The following month, the fuselage of an Adam Air jet cracked after a hard landing, and then in 2008, another plane ran off the runway. These numerous incidents led Indonesian authorities to ground part of Adam Air's fleet, and finally in March 2008, the troubled airline collapsed when it could not renew its insurance (Osman, 2008b).",

The order was the largest ever in Boeing's history in terms of the number of aircraft and their total value (approximately USD 22 billion at list prices, though large customers like Lion Air rarely pay full price). Then in 2013, Lion Air stunned the aviation community again with an even larger order: USD 24 billion for 234 Airbus A320 and A321 jets (Clark, 2013).

The state-owned airport operator, Angkasa Pura II, plans to build a third runway by 2020 and fourth terminal by 2022 and refurbish the two older terminals at the airport, which together will increase capacity to 100 million (Susanty, 2017). Yet the experience of Terminal 3 suggests that the expansion will take longer. Ground was broken on the new terminal in 2012, but then the project became mired in red tape and difficulties in acquiring land for the expanded airport. Progress resumed with the election of Joko Widodo to the presidency. Jokowi, as the president was more commonly known, had been governor of Jakarta before becoming president and made the airport a top priority (Koyanagi & Suzuki, 2016).",

Economic growth, buoyed by commodity exports to China, propelled millions of Indonesians into the middle class during the same period in which air travel soared. But GDP growth has slowed since 2010 (The Economist, 2016a). One of the chief impediments to stronger performance is weak infrastructure. Jokowi's commitment to breaking down that barrier through massive investment has mixed implications for aviation and LCCs in particular. Although the president's focus is on the sea (he said in his inaugural address, \u201cWe have to work as hard as possible to turn Indonesia into maritime nation again.\u201d), Jokowi's government also aims to build 15 new airports and to lengthen the runways of existing airports across the archipelago (The Economist, 2016b). The longer runways will ease the expansion of LCCs since they are intended to accommodate aircraft as large as the Boeing 737 (i.e., the size class instrumental to most budget airline fleets) in communities across mainly peripheral areas of the country (Natahadibrata, 2014). For instance, several of the longer runways will be in the relatively impoverished Maluku Islands in eastern Indonesia.",

For instance, one priority project is the Trans-Sumatra Highway which will link the largest cities on Indonesia's large western island (Antara News, 2018). Another longer-term challenge to the primacy of low-cost aviation is the development of high speed rail. A Chinese-Indonesian joint venture has been contracted to build a link between Jakarta-Bandung with services to commence in 2019 (Chew, 2016). The 142-km intercity distance is too short to be suitable for air travel and so the new HSR connection does not threaten the country's airlines, but the further elaboration of the rail network could. And yet, rail and highway projects are beset by some of the same problems that have confounded airport development in the country. The Jakarta-Bandung link, for instance, has been hobbled by resistance in the country's legislature, where lawmakers contend the project is a betrayal of Jokowi's promise to focus on developing infrastructure in provinces outside of Java (Chew, 2016).",

Its giant guns could only repel an attack by sea from the south, not the Japanese land invasion across the causeway linking Singapore and what was then called Malaya to the north.

As the days passed, the defenders retreated within an ever-shrinking perimeter in the city's southeast, and finally the British surrendered on February 15, 1942.

Political wounds were still raw, with Singapore have been expelled from Malaysia just 2 years earlier, and the Philippines and Malaysia still entangled in a dispute over a large expanse of resource-rich Borneo (New York Times, 1969). The myriad differences among the members meant that for decades ASEAN made little headway toward achieving its goals of economic integration. In 1979, for instance, almost all international flights to, from, and within Southeast Asia involved one of the region's five key hubs (Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, and Manila); Hanoi's only international connection within the region was to Bangkok and Rangoon's only link was to Singapore (Bowen, 2000).

On the eve of its conversion, the carrier operated a mixed fleet of old DC-9s and Boeing 757s (Air Transport World, 2005).

Two important milestones along the road from Phnom Penh were the 2009 Multilateral Agreement on Air Services (MAAS) and the 2010 Multilateral Agreement for Full Liberalization of Passenger Air Services (MAFLPAS), which together sought to supplant the narrowly restrictive bilateral air services agreements of the past. The MAAS aimed at deregulating market access at two kinds of cities\u2014the region's capital cities on the one hand and marginal places in the region's periphery (e.g., the weakly developed area comprised of Mindanao, Borneo, and other smaller islands near them) on the other hand. The MAFLPAS then sought to \u201cmop up\u201d the remaining cities (e.g., key secondary cities such as Surabaya in Indonesia) to bring them under the umbrella of liberalizing reform. Not every ASEAN member signed on to both agreements, and even some of those who did limited their impact by restricting the cities to which their various protocols applied. By 2015, the target date for a Single Aviation Market, the Philippines had not agreed to the MAAS and neither Indonesia nor Laos had yet signed on to the MAFLPAS (Bowen, 2016).",
