In contrast, two efficient programmes of regeneration exist in the adult fish CNS, neurite regrowth and remyelination.The rapidity of CNS remyelination is critical since it not only restores fast conduction of nerve impulses but also maintains axon integrity. If myelin repair fails, axons degenerate, leading to increased disability. In the human CNS demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS), remyelination often takes place in the midst of inflammation. Here, we discuss recent studies that address the innate repair capabilities of the axon-glia unit from fish to man.We propose that expansion of this research field will help find ways to maintain or enhance spontaneous remyelination in man.",

These data come from gene expression analysis of MS neural tissues and experiments in a variety of animal models. Discoveries regarding the molecular basis of myelination and the biology of adult neural stem cells have also influenced views on myelin repair in the adult central nervous system (CNS) (reviewed in Dubois-Dalcq et al., 2005; Miller and Mi, 2007) . Here, we present our viewpoint on these studies by apposing observations in man and human tissues to results obtained in experimental models. We particularly want to draw attention to the importance of restoring fast conduction in demyelinated axons by rapid remyelination in man and of developing strategies to enhance remyelination at the early stages of MS based on visualization of ongoing, recent demyelinating events by imaging.",

Newly made myelin sheaths are indeed thinner than normal, have shorter internodes and variability in nodal length (Perier and Gr\u00e9goire, 1965) . These variations in myelin thickness and internode distance in shadow plaques might decrease the robustness of saltatory conduction along myelinated axons. Yet, in animal models, the conduction velocity increases during remyelination. For instance, grafting of embryonic glial cells into the dorsal columns of myelin-deficient rats resulted in a significant increase in conduction velocity compared to non-transplanted regions, provided a sufficient density of sodium channels is restored at the nodes of Ranvier (Utzschneider et al., 1994) .",

An important question is whether genes modulating disease severity influence myelin repair. A case to study is HLA-G which is involved in materno-foetal tolerance and expressed in the CNS in inflammatory conditions. In women with relapsing-remitting MS, levels of expression of HLA-G in blood mononuclear cells and in serum during pregnancy and postpartum inversely correlate with disease activity (Airas et al., 2007) . Discovery of genes modulating repair will expand our understanding of the physiological and molecular basis of endogenous CNS remyelination. It will likely provide clues as to how to develop strategies to enhance this spontaneous repair process that has been preserved by evolutionary pressure since the appearance of myelin in the first gnatostomes, the placoderms. This is a highly successful fish group that arose about 425 million years ago, and was a dominant organism in the ocean during the Devonian period (Zalc and Colman, 2000; Zalc, 2006; Zalc et al., 2008 in press ).",

            "text": "It is rather fascinating to browse through papers on fish CNS regeneration as they outline many of the processes occurring during axonal regeneration and remyelination in mammals. The process of axonal regeneration is also relevant to MS in view of the extensive axonal damage, including transection, which occurs in this disease. The optic nerve, a frequent site of the first clinical manifestation of MS, has been the focus of several early fish studies. Murray (1976) studied cytoskeletal and organelle changes during regeneration of goldfish retinal axons after optic nerve transection, reporting that 'the regenerating axons gradually increase in diameter but do not reach preoperative sizes' while 'remyelination is delayed and proceeds slowly'. Wolburg's study (1981) of goldfish optic nerve crush described that the regenerating axons acquired thinner myelin sheaths. The author proposed that 'a neuron is capable of inducing a normally developed myelin sheath when its axon contacts an oligodendrocyte for the first time whereas a neuron whose axon contacts an oligodendrocyte the second time is not capable of forming a normal myelin sheath in the adult animal'. Nona et al. (2000) later found that, after optic nerve injury in fish, remyelination only occurred after the regenerating axons had reached the tectum where the axon terminals refine their map. Myelin repair was synchronous throughout the optic nerve and exacted by both Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes. Myelin protein zero, the major myelin protein in the mammalian peripheral nervous system (PNS), is present in zebrafish optic nerve and spinal cord where its expression increases during regeneration (Schweitzer et al., 2003) . These fish studies therefore underline the requirement of connectivity of damaged CNS axons before axons can be remyelinated. This is in keeping with developmental studies in the mouse showing the crucial role of electrical activity along axons to induce myelination (Demerens et al., 1996; Stevens et al., 2002) . It may also be important in MS where the maintenance or re-establishment of connectivity of demyelinated axons may be a prerequisite for remyelination.",

A continuous process of oligodendrocyte extension and branching precedes the final positioning and wrapping of the axon by oligodendrocytes. When such oligodendrocytes were ablated by laser microsurgery, other oligodendrocytes compensated for the loss by rapidly extending new processes and migrating towards the region abandoned by the dying oligodendrocyte (Fig. 1) . After all oligodendrocytes were ablated in five hemi-segments of the spinal cord, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) from the intact hemi-segments rapidly migrated toward the lesion site whilst dividing. The result was that 50% of oligodendrocytes had already been replaced on the lesion side at 1 day (ibidem).",

EAE has been extensively used to identify immunoregulators for preclinical trial in MS (reviewed in Gold et al., 2006) and also to assay remyelination as in a study on the role of Notch in repair (Seifert et al., 2007) . Recently, cortical demyelination was induced by focal injection of proinflammatory cytokines in subclinically MOG-immunized rats, a model originally developed in the spinal cord (Kerschensteiner et al., 2004; Merkler et al., 2006) . After cortical inflammation subsided, rapid remyelination occurred, mimicking extensive remyelination observed in MS cortical lesions (Albert et al., 2007) . Mice deficient in neural and immune system genes have been used extensively in these models to study their impact on remyelination. Fig. 1 Time-lapse recording and OPC ablation experiment in transgenic olig2 EGFP zebrafish larva (at 60 h post fertilization) which expresses EGFP both in axons and OPCs. Image of spinal cord (dorsal side up) before and after laser ablation. Membrane bound GFP + oligodendrocyte-lineage cells which had migrated dorsally were targeted by their fluorescence and ablated using approximately five pulses of 440 nm light generated by a Photonics Micropoint Laser System. At time zero after ablation, the oligodendrocyte (arrow) extends new processes into the area vacated by the ablated cell (arrowhead) and later starts to enwrap axons between 3 and 8 h. The larvae were anaesthesized during both ablation and time lapse and then placed on their side on glassbottomed 35 mm Petri dishes. The time lapse images were captured using 40 \u00c2 oil-immersion objectives mounted on a motorized Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope equipped with a Perkin Elmer ERS spinning disk confocal system with a heated stage and chamber to maintain embryos at 28.5oC (Kirby et al., 2006) .

Both rodent and MS white matter OPCs express Olig 2, Nkx2.2 and Myt1 transcription factors when recruited to demyelinating lesions (Sim et al., 2002; Fancy et al., 2004; Nait-Oumesmar et al., 2007; Vana et al., 2007b) . In mouse SVZ, some OPC markers such as NG2 and olig 2 are sometimes expressed in type C precursors which are derived from GFAP-expressing neural stem cells (Doetsch et al., 2002; Aguirre et al., 2004) . The finding of OPC markers in some SVZ precursors may be due to the rapid commitment to an oligodendrocyte fate when precursors move out of the SVZ or a pre-commitment of these precursors to this fate within the SVZ (Delaunay et al., 2008) as described also in the case of neurons (Kohwi et al., 2007) .",

When grafted into dysmyelinating shiverer mice-which lack myelin basic protein-these human OPCs extensively migrate and remyelinate the mouse white matter (Windrem et al., 2004) . As remyelination occurs in MS, it is presumed that OPCs recruited from normal appearing white matter to lesions have similar remyelinating properties. The transcriptional profile of freshly sorted human OPCs was compared to that of the white matter from which they were isolated.

In some MS cases, Schwann cells were found in the spinal cord and hindbrain where they synthesize PNS myelin around demyelinated CNS axons (reviewed in Compston et al., 2006) . Importantly, the Schwann cells that migrate and remyelinate CNS lesions after experimental demyelination of rat dorsal columns by ethidium bromide (EB) restore fast conduction 'within normal limits' (Felts and Smith, 1992) . Moreover, a normal pattern of sodium and potassium channels at the nodes of Ranvier was maintained 1 year after a similar EB lesion was made . Normal conduction velocity was also restored after grafting labelled cultured Schwann cells into EB-treated, glial free dorsal columns (Honmou et al., 1996) . These observations strongly suggest that PNS myelin made by remyelinating Schwann cells may restore conduction of CNS axons also in MS. Thus Schwann cell migration into the CNS is a remarkable natural repair mechanism. However, we do not know how extensive this is and what attract these repair cells to the CNS. Could it be the same factors that attract OPCs?",

Experiments in transgenic mice have also revealed a role for these factors in remyelination. Indeed, mouse OPCs overexpressing human EGF-R showed increased mitotic and migratory activity toward a corpus callosum lesion and this resulted in acceleration of remyelination and functional recovery (Aguirre et al., 2007) . Transgenic mice overexpressing the human PDGF A gene and submitted to a cuprizone diet that caused chronic demyelination, showed enhanced remyelination and oligodendrocyte numbers after removal of the diet (Vana et al., 2007a) . The migration response of OPCs to PDGF is enhanced in vitro by the polysialylated form of the neural adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) (Zhang et al., 2004) . In response to a demyelinating event in the corpus callosum, some SVZ precursors expressing PDGFR alpha and PSA-NCAM divide, migrate away from the SVZ and generate OPCs in the lesion (Menn et al., 2006) . Accordingly, the SVZ of MS patients shows a significant increase in PSA-NCAM expressing precursors which also appear to migrate toward lesions (Nait-Oumesmar et al., 2007) . Interestingly, both OPCs and Schwann cells engineered to overexpress PSA on N-CAM show enhanced migratory properties in the rodent CNS (Lavdas et al., 2006; Glaser et al., 2007) .",

In MS, Sema3A and Sema3F expression is elevated in glial cells in and around active lesions and also in neurons whose axons have been demyelinated. There is a differential expression pattern, so that more Sema3F (attractive) expression is seen around and within those plaques which are very active with a dense inflammatory infiltrate, compared to more Sema3A (repulsive) expression around and within less active plaques (Williams et al., 2007) . These results suggest that repulsive or attractive properties of different semaphorins can influence OPC migration, a prerequisite for MS plaque remyelination. In addition, these observations are in good agreement with several reports on the pro-remyelinating influence of inflammation.",

Therefore, it would be beneficial to 'protect' axons at this time to enhance their survival, maintain axon connectivity and facilitate re-emergence of myelinating signals whilst OPCs are being recruited to the lesion site (reviewed in Scolding and Dubois-Dalcq, 2008) . Some neurotrophic factors released either by immune cells or neurons may act locally to protect demyelinated axons in MS lesions. First, the synthesis of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) or brainderived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by immune cells is increased in MS patients treated with glatiramer acetate (a synthetic peptide mimicking MBP structure and inhibiting T cell peptide binding) or interferon (IFN) beta1a, the two major immunomodulators used to treat relapsingremitting MS (Sarchielli et al., 2007) . Thus these treatments are also potentially neuroprotective. Second, cortical neurons in MS showed increased expression of CNTF, its tripartite receptor complex composed of CNTR alpha, LIFR beta and gp130, and their phosphorylated downstream products (Dutta et al., 2007) .",

The first wave of myelin gene up-regulation, concomitant with downregulation of cytoskeleton maintenance-related genes, leads to ensheathment of nerve fibres. The second wave of up-regulation of intercellular junction genes may be linked to the assembly of the nodes of Ranvier.",

A complete, functional nodal region depends on each myelin loop maintaining a septate-like junction with the axon, while Kv1.2 channels are kept at bay in the juxtanodes. A first event in node formation is the induction of axonal Nav1.2 channel clusters, possibly by an as yet uncharacterized soluble factor made by oligodendrocytes (Kaplan et al., 1997 (Kaplan et al., , 2001 . This process defines domains where oligodendrocytes position themselves along the axon to synthesize myelin internodes. Myelin excludes axonal Nav1.2 channels along the internode and promotes clustering of newly emerging Nav1.6 channels at the node while specific axon-glia interactions result in paranode/juxtanode formation. In the case of axon branching, collaterals dictate the position of the nodes of Ranvier. Since collaterals are branching before OPCs migrate towards axons, the position of branching points determines where the nodes of Ranvier will assemble. Thus, the putative oligodendroglial clustering factor can only regulate the distribution of nodes between two collaterals, therefore controlling the number (n) and the length (L) of the internode. The latter is calculated by the simple equation: L = Dc/n, where Dc is the distance between two branch points (Lubetzki and Zalc, 2001) .",

Induction of Fyn kinase in OPCs by axons triggers oligodendrocyte process extension which is an essential event preceding myelin wrapping (Klein et al., 2002) .

The concept emerging from these studies is that glutamate release by axons helps OPCs to find axons through an activity-dependent process, reinforcing the importance of electrical activity in OPC development and myelination (Barres and Raff, 1993; Demerens et al., 1996; Stevens et al., 2002; Karadottir and Attwell, 2007) .

            "text": "Returning to the subject of remyelination in man, it appears that the first requirement is to reset the nodes by re-assembly of specific molecular complexes with adhesion molecules (Sasaki et al., 2006) . The scenario for remyelination in MS is proposed as starting with the formation of several nodal-like clusters of Nav channels, often in partially remyelinated lesions as visualized on fibres that are still PLP-negative (Coman et al., 2006) . In the rodent PNS, Nav channel clustering is promoted by gliomedin at the tips of Schwann cells and its cleavage product released in the node area (Eshed et al., 2007; Maertens et al., 2007) . Gliomedin has been detected in the CNS but it is not yet fully characterized (Manuel Koch, personal communication). As CNS myelin synthesis progresses, Nav1.6 clusters are emerging and associate with the neuronal form of neurofascin (Nfasc186), a signature of node restoration (Howell et al., 2006) . Consolidation of node organisation may occur at the time when persisting currents with glutamate release sites along demyelinated axons may guide the correct positioning of adult OPCs processes before they enwrap axons to make myelin internodes. Intriguingly, this proposed sequence of repair events in MS is the reverse of the one predicted from the developmental waves of mouse oligodendrocyte gene expression discussed above where myelin internode synthesis starts first (Cahoy et al., 2008) . If the nodes of Ranvier are recontructed when internode synthesis is not yet occurring or is far from completion, could it result in node/internode abnormalities?",

As mentioned above, a thin myelin sheath and increased nodal length are often observed during remyelination in vertebrates. Yet the association of remyelinating cells with naked axons in rodents closely resembles that in normal myelin (reviewed in Franklin and Hinks, 1999) . These characteristics are observed whether remyelinating cells are endogenous or exogenous and also in remyelination by Schwann cells. There is no substantial increase in axon diameter during remyelination whereas during development, as the animal grows and matures, the axons increase in length and diameter leading to an increase of myelin internode length and thickness. This suggests that axons may bear or release molecules that increase in density or production proportional to growth to control these parameters.",

Such human studies may be guided by technologies already successfully applied to developmental myelination. A comparative transcriptome analysis from fish to man would consolidate the list of essential, conserved genes involved in signalling myelin repair and help the design of small compounds acting on their signalling pathways. As Olig 1 is a transcription factor essential for rodent remyelination (Arnett et al., 2004) , ongoing gene profiling studies comparing remyelination in Olig1 deficient mice to wild-type mice is likely to yield interesting data on key regulators of remyelination downstream from Olig1 (S.

It is present in active MS lesions and, when administered to MS patients, it aggravated clinical signs and this was attributed to an increase in immune activation (Panitch et al., 1987) . In hindsight, this detrimental effect may have also been due partly to oligodendrocyte death and/or stress as both occur in mice overexpressing this cytokine. Such effects can be attenuated by Stat pathway inhibitors such as the 'suppressor of cytokine signalling' (Balabanov et al., 2006) . The effect of IFN gamma at the lesion site-at concentrations close to those observed in vivo-was examined in mice by inducing cytokine release during recovery from EAE or cuprizone treatment (Lin et al., 2006) . In both models, the induction of IFN gamma synthesis strongly inhibited lesion repopulation by OPCs, remyelination and clinical recovery (in the case of EAE). This was correlated with endoplasmic reticulum stress in remyelinating oligodendrocytes, suggesting that inhibitors of such stress responses may help repair in MS.",

            "text": "In addition to these major advances in MRI techniques, it would be useful to develop a molecular imaging technique specific for myelin that would quantify CNS remyelination and further validate the MRI approaches. This could be achieved using positron emission tomography (PET). Of great interest is the recent identification of a newly synthesized fluorescent Congo red derivative, 1,4-bis-(p-aminostyryl)-2-methoxy benzene), also named BMB, that selectively binds to myelin ex vivo and in vivo ( Fig. 3A ; Stankoff et al., 2006) . This compound allowed the detection of dysmyelination in myelin mutants and of demyelinated lesions in EAE. In MS brain samples, levels of BMB staining can differentiate remyelination in shadow plaques from either demyelinated lesions or normal appearing white matter (Fig. 3B) , suggesting that this biomarker could be used to quantify myelin loss and repair. BMB was shown to cross the blood brain barrier and, when radiolabelled with carbon-11, imaging of CNS myelin was obtained by PET in non-human primates (Fig. 3C) . Interestingly, a similar affinity for CNS myelin was reported for several other Congo red derivatives (Xiang et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2006) . As Congo red derivatives were previously known to be amyloid markers, these findings suggest the existence of a molecular target common to amyloid plaques and CNS myelin. In favour of this proposal is the observation that other amyloid markers, related to thioflavinT, could also stain myelin and be used as a PET radiotracer for myelin (Stankoff et al., unpublished data) .",

Ideally, the best way to promote remyelination and therefore protect demyelinated axons is to promote efficient endogenous remyelination by native cells rather than surgically introducing exogenous cells. As the advantages and risks of transplantation approaches in MS have been reviewed elsewhere Zujovic et al., 2007; Chandran et al., 2008; Scolding and Dubois-Dalcq, in press), we have chosen here to discuss spontaneous remyelination in the CNS because expansion of this field of research might bring promyelinating therapies to the bedside. To do this, we must continue to learn more about the normal repair process in all animal models, including fish. We also must be able to consistently visualise remyelination in living mammals and correlate this to functional recovery, otherwise in vivo testing of putative remyelination enhancers will be slow and uncertain. Concomitantly, the postulated impact of remyelination on the clinical course of MS should become measurable with increasingly myelin-specific imaging technologies.",

The characterization of the NOGO receptor complex, its interaction with myelin inhibitors (reviewed by Schwab et al., 2006) and the demonstration that intracellular cAMP and its downstream targets may promote axonal regeneration (reviewed by Hannila and Filbin, 2008) , have led to new clinical approaches in attempting to treat spinal cord injury (Rossignol et al., 2007) .

However, as discussed here and before , there are a number of promising avenues being explored that might reach the bedside in the next few years provided that research in basic and clinical science keeps its momentum. Fig. 3 The Congo Red derivative BMB is a myelin marker on brain sections (A, B) and is suitable for PET imaging (C). (A) When injected into mice intraperitoneally (40 mg/g), BMB crosses the blood brain barrier and stains the cerebellar white matter (green fluorescence, arrows). (B) When 1mM of BMB was incubated in vitro on MS brains sections a clear fluorescent staining of the normal appearing white matter (NAWM) was obtained. The demyelinated area ('Dem' delineated by dotted line in the upper left corner) was visualized as a lack of staining. In the shadow plaque area ('Rem' surrounded by arrowheads), BMB staining is of intermediate intensity between that observed in demyelinated plaques ('Dem') and normal appearing white matter (NAWM). (C) CNS PET imaging using [11C]-BMB (about 100 MBq) injected intravenously in an anaesthetized baboon. This 110 min PETexamination was performed using an ECAT HR+ camera.The axial slice from PET imaging was co-registered with a corresponding slice of the brain MRI scan.

Pictures were taken from adjacent, sequential sections; the first section (A) was stained with luxol fast blue for myelin and PAS (nuclei are stained blue by hematoxylin) while all other sections were stained by peroxidase immunolabelling for different antigens (B^F). (A) Extensive demyelination with scarce, thin and irregular remyelinated fibres in light blue (arrows). (B) Proteolipid protein antibody stains abundant thin, apparently newly formed myelin sheaths. (C) Oligodendrocytes in the lesion are strongly immunolabelled (in brown) for TPPP/p25, the brain-specific tubulin polymerization promoting protein(Kovacs et al., 2004). Source: Antibody kindly provided by Poul H. Jensen, Aarhus, Denmark. (D^F) Abundant immune cells are detected in the same remyelinating lesion and identified as foamy macrophages (KiM1P in D) as well asT cells stained for CD3 (E) and CD8 (F). Scale bar: 50 mm.",
