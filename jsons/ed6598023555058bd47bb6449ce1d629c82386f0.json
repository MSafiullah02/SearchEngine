            "text": "To see whether net mortalities increase during and after reductions in medical services, either at average weekends, or at Christmas when pressure from illness is unusually high. Methods (1) Paired t -tests to compare mean daily deaths and hospital admissions during and after weekends (Saturday-Tuesday) with means for the week, in south-east England; (2) Linear regressions to see whether trends of daily deaths change when admissions are reduced at Christmas. Results Neither mean daily all-cause, respiratory or ischaemic heart deaths exceeded weekly averages during weekends, or during Saturday-Monday or Saturday-Tuesday, despite falls in daily elective and daily emergency hospital admissions at weekends that averaged 61-72% and 14-22%, respectively. During 19-24 December, daily deaths were above annual means, respiratory deaths by 49% (29, 1-58), but elective admissions fell and although emergency admissions tended to rise, total admissions rose only for respiratory disease, and only by 33% (376, -47 to 799). On Christmas Day (25 December), even emergency admissions fell sharply below previous trends, respiratory emergency admissions by 18% ( P < 0.01). Respiratory deaths alone then immediately increased ( P < 0.01) above trend, by 5.9% (5.8 deaths/day) on 26 December and by 12.9% (12.9) on 27 December. Conclusions No adverse effect on mortality was apparent within 2 days from reduction in medical services at weekends. However, respiratory deaths accelerated sharply after reduction in elective and emergency admissions at Christmas, when rates of infection and mortality from respiratory disease were high. Implications for medical services during respiratory epidemics are discussed.",

Respiratory infections by influenza and respiratory syncytial virus are high at that time (http:// www.phls.co.uk/topicsaz/index.htm). Haemoconcentration resulting from cold stress (Keatinge et al . 1984; Neild et al . 1994) , and increased blood fibrinogen resulting from respiratory infections (Woodhouse et al . 1994) , both tend to increase ischaemic heart deaths.

South-east England for the year starting 1992 (1 April) or earlier was designated as the area controlled by health authorities of East Anglia, north-west Thames, north-east Thames, south-west Thames, south-east Thames, and Oxford; for 1993-98 as the regions of Anglia and Oxford, north Thames and south Thames; and for 1999-2000 as the eastern, London and south-east regions. For the year starting 1994 or earlier, admissions were broken down by primary diagnosis using the ninth International Disease Classification (ICD9) and thereafter by the 10th ICD (ICD10), for ischaemic heart disease (ICD9 410.0-414.9 and ICD10 I20-I25), respiratory disease (460.0-519.9 and J00-J99); influenza (487.0-487.9 and J10-J11), and all-cause (0-999.9 and A00-Y34). The deaths certified as influenza provide a marker for much larger numbers of deaths secondary to influenza (Donaldson & Keatinge 2002) Daily deaths for these years in South-east England (standard region) were supplied by the Office of National Statistics. This region comprised Greater London, Hertfordshire, Essex, Kent, East and West Sussex, Hampshire, Surrey, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Bedfordshire, and approximately matched the area for hospital admissions. Cause of death was coded using ICD9 except for January 2001 for which ICD10 was used. Standard adjustments were made for the change in coding practice in 1993. Temperatures were daily values from London Heathrow, provided by the Royal Meteorological Office.",

However, neither mean daily deaths from all-causes, respiratory or ischaemic heart disease increased, either during weekends or during the weekends plus either 1 or 2 days following them; (2) Cold weather in the days leading up to Christmas was associated with increased illness and mortality, particularly from respiratory infections, but elective admissions for each cause fell, and only emergency admissions for respiratory disease increased significantly above annual mean, presumably reflecting recognition by health staff of need for urgent admission of acute respiratory cases. Even emergency admissions for respiratory disease were sharply reduced on Christmas Day and respiratory deaths then increased above trend on the next and subsequent days. This increase was too rapid in its early stages to be attributable to spread of infection at Christmas Day gatherings. Pulmonary symptoms resulting from infection by rhinoviruses, coronaviruses and respiratory syncytial viruses only start 3 days, and symptoms of influenza 2-4 days, after infection (Tyrrell et al. 1993; Isaacs 1996) . The cutback in hospital admissions, and probably in other medical services, on Christmas Day provides the most likely explanation for the acceleration of deaths immediately afterwards. The fact that large cutbacks in admissions at average weekends were not associated with any net increase in deaths during and for 2 days after the weekend is evidence that virtually all patients with acute, treatable illnesses which were life threatening in the short term were still admitted at weekends. The cutbacks in admissions at weekends were apparently successfully confined to patients without such pressing need for treatment. We know of no estimate of the overall proportion of admissions made up of such patients, although 1-20% of admissions to British hospitals have been judged inappropriate to the nature and severity of the patient's illness and the facilities of the hospital, and therefore unlikely to benefit the patient, rapidly or otherwise (Anderson et al. 1988; Victor & Khakoo 1994; Smith et al. 1997; McDonough et al. 2000) . The selective admission of seriously ill people at weekends can incidentally explain high hospital mortality reported among people admitted at weekends (Bell & Redelmeier 2002) , without needing to attribute that mortality to deficiencies in hospital treatment at weekends.",

            "text": "The fact that the increase in deaths after Christmas was confined to respiratory disease can be explained by the particularly high level of respiratory infection at the time, and by the fact that antibiotics, oxygen therapy and positive pressure ventilation can be lifesaving in acute respiratory failure, and can be given most quickly and effectively to patients who are already in hospital. The cutbacks in hospital admissions at that time may be partly because of patients' choice, although it seems unlikely that many people acutely ill with respiratory infections would refuse admission in order to spend Christmas at home. Action to reduce cold stress, particularly outdoors, could reduce both the respiratory and other illness in cold weather (Keatinge 1987; Eurowinter Group 1997) . Immunization against respiratory syncytial virus, in addition to current immunization against influenza (Treanor & Falsey 1999) , may also have scope to do so. However, the main implication of the present results is that any major respiratory epidemic is likely to require a large number of admissions to beds with facilities for managing respiratory failure, if unnecessary deaths are to be avoided. Current epidemics of respiratory infections are minor compared to the influenza epidemics of 1970s, but the recent appearances of the Fuji strain of influenza, and of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have raised the possibility that a new virus may produce another large epidemic of respiratory disease before natural or artificial immunity to it can be established.",
