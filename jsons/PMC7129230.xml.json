MERS is caused by a single-stranded RNA virus named MERS-corona virus (MERS-CoV) that belongs to the genus Beta coronavirus [3]. It is believed that the virus enters the cells through fusion with its plasma membrane. This is achieved when the viral envelop protein S (S protein) binds to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) as the host receptor, which is abundantly expressed in the lung tissue of mammals [4], [5], [6].",

Human-to-human transmission is usually via direct contact with affected individuals and is higher among household and in healthcare settings [23], [24], [25]. Commonly reported symptoms of MERS-CoV infection included cough, fever, breathing difficulty, sore throat, headache, vomiting and diarrhea [7], [26]. Some patients may develop acute respiratory failure and acute kidney injury, which are considered as the major complications of the disease [27], [28].",

Interleukin 17 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by T-helper cells in response to STAT3 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways [36]. All the patients with MERS-CoV infection had a marked increase in IL-17, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 but not IL-12 (IL-12p40 and IL-12p70) when compared to the healthy controls. This finding suggests that MERS-CoV infection in humans activates a Th1 and Th17 pro-inflammatory cytokine profile. On the other hand, there was no significant increase in IL4 (Fig. 2\nB), IL5 (Fig. 3A), and IL-13 (Fig. 3C) concentration in MERS-CoV infected patients compared to healthy controls (p > .05). Moreover, significant increase in the levels of TNF-\u03b1 was detected in plasma samples of patients (P < .01, Fig. 3E) while no change was detected with respect to TGF-\u03b1 level (P > .05, Fig. 3F). TNF-\u03b1 is produced by many cells, including macrophages, CD4+ lymphocytes, NK cells, lung-epithelial cells and others [37].

This is in part due to the high fatality of the viral infection which causes an acute onset of respiratory symptoms including pneumonia and alveolar destruction [42] leading, in many cases, to death. In this study, we analyzed a panel of 13 inflammatory markers in plasma samples obtained from seven patients diagnosed with MERS-CoV infection.

Type-1 interferons are produced by the interaction between certain cellular receptors with viral components including viral genome. Binding of IFN-\u03b12 to its receptor initiates a signaling cascade that leads to an increase in the expression of many downstream signaling targets called interferon-stimulated genes [43]. The products of these genes may play a critical role in inhibition of viral spread into non-infected cells and interference of viral replication in the infected cells [44]. IFN-\u03b3, on the other hand, is known to mediate its effect via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway leading to the subsequent activation of macrophages and NK cells, and expression of specific major histocompatibility complex proteins [45], [46]. A study by Zhou et al. [47] showed that infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages with MERS-CoV induced the expression of IFN-\u03b3 and the subsequent expression of major histocompatibility complex class-I genes [47]. In addition, infection of airway epithelial cell lines with MERS-CoV induced the expression of IFN-\u03b12, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, possibly through the activation of STAT3 pathway [48]. Elevation of IFN-\u03b12 and IFN-\u03b3 was reported from patients infected with MERS-CoV [41]. Since IFN-\u03b12 and IFN-\u03b3 were known to promote antigen presentation and the development of a robust antiviral adaptive Th-1 immune response, the elevation of these interferons may be essential to develop immunity against MERS-CoV infection [49]. Consistent with previous findings [47], our results showed a significant elevation in TNF-\u03b1 levels in response to MERS-CoV infection. Previous studies showed that TNF-\u03b1 exerts a strong antiviral activity against avian, swine, and human influenza viruses [50].",

When induced, STAT3 selectively inhibits NF-\u03baB activated genes, such as IL-12, required for the successful activation of Th1 immune response [56]. The exact role played by STAT3 in viral infections is still to be elucidated. Some viral infections, such as HBV [57] and HCV [58], promote STAT3-mediated gene expression; while other viral infections, such as influenza A virus [59] and SARS CoV [60], disrupt STAT3-mediated gene expression.",

Thus, assessment of host response in sera of infected patients may not be representative of host response against the MERS-CoV in the airways. In addition, patients were not followed and therefore, clinical outcomes of the infection were not assessed. Moreover, the plasma cytokine levels were measured in a single blood sample and therefore, it is impossible to know whether peak cytokine levels were measured. Future studies that include examining broncho-alveolar lavage to get a better representation of host immune are strongly recommended. In addition, correlating changes in cytokine profile with clinical outcomes of the infection would enhance the expected knowledge from such studies. The results of plasma cytokine need to be confirmed in a larger sample with multiple sampling times to be able to catch peak cytokine levels.",
