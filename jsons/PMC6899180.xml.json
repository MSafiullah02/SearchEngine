In healthy patients, neutrophils and monocytes are early responders that are important for combating a pathogen, limiting tissue damage and promoting the return to organ function and homeostasis3. These leukocytes must integrate diverse environmental signals to inform their protective functional responses4. Sepsis is characterized by immune cell dysfunction, which is linked to the pathophysiology of the disease with consequent organ injury and increased associated mortality1. In experimental sepsis in mice, regulating leukocyte function decreases organ injury and lessens the severity of the infection5. The assessment of leukocyte activation and function may enable new therapeutic strategies for the management of human sepsis and inflammatory diseases.",

The monitoring of leukocyte counts does not reliably reflect patients\u2019 clinical and treatment responses. Sepsis-3 guidelines define sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, where end-organ injury and disease severity are defined by the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score6. These criteria carry an ~30% misdiagnosis rate7 and offer little insight into the underlying pathobiology. Multiple point-of-care microfluidic devices have been used to investigate circulating cytokines and other mediators of inflammation as potential biomarkers in sepsis, but no device that reliably predicts severity and outcomes has emerged8\u201314. Since leukocytes (white blood cells) are sensors for multiple environmental cues and pathogens4, their activation and function could prove useful as cellular biomarkers of illness. To this end, polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) dysmotility in microfluidic chambers correlates with sepsis diagnosis15. Importantly, repeated measurement of the complete blood count (CBC) can contribute to anaemia, which is often present in hospitalized critically ill patients16. Ideally, new methods for the assessment of leukocyte function during the course of a patient\u2019s illness should be sample sparing to decrease the risk of iatrogenic anaemia.",

We modified our previous device and developed a closed-loop inertial microfluidic platform for the label-free isolation of adequate leukocyte numbers from microlitre blood volumes. A sample sparing approach would enable the acquisition of multiple biospecimens in one day, or during a hospital stay, for the repeated assessment of the host response without leading to iatrogenic anaemia. Here we demonstrate the power of preparative inertial microfluidics and cell-based assays of leukocyte activation and function in a proof-of-concept cohort of human patients with sepsis. Despite a relatively small sample size, this innovative integrative approach was more highly correlated to sepsis severity than the current clinical practice of measuring peripheral blood leukocyte counts and differentials.",

Eight spiral microchannels with a trapezoidal cross-sectional design (Fig. 1a,b) were connected in parallel with a circulation pump (see Methods) to a sample tube containing diluted blood (1:1,000 volume/volume (v/v))19. As the diluted blood passed through the spiral microchannels, the system ordered and aligned the cells by size at each lateral equilibrium position secondary to a balance between the cells\u2019 inertial lift and Dean drag forces20,21. This inertial microfluidics system was compared to an established method for leukocyte isolation by density-based gradient separation (see Methods, Fig. 1c). Relative to density-based gradient separation, the inertial microfluidics system had a shorter operation time (~22 min versus ~175 min; Fig. 1d). This system also increased PMN concentration by approximately eightfold relative to input sample (Fig. 1e). Both leukocyte isolation methods significantly decreased erythrocytes (red blood cells) to a similar extent (Fig. 1f).",

With inertial microfluidics separation, the mean expression of these cell adhesion molecules was similar to pre-isolation whole blood and significantly lower than the density-based gradient method (Fig. 1g\u2013i). In pre-isolation whole blood and after inertial microfluidic separation, PMN subsets were determined by flow cytometry (see Methods, Supplementary Fig. 2). The relative percentages of the PMN subsets (CD16bright, CD16dim, CD16\u2212) in pre-isolated whole blood significantly correlated with PMNs after isolation by inertial microfluidics (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The PMN functions in whole blood and after isolation were also similar when phagocytosis and phagolysosome formation were tested using Escherichia coli pHrodo bioparticles (Supplementary Fig. 3b). In addition, there was significant concordance for the detection of the PMN activation markers CD62L (Supplementary Fig. 3c) and CD69 (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Notably, no significant correlation was identified for CD11b (Supplementary Fig. 3e) and CD42b expression on PMNs (Supplementary Fig. 3f). Together, these findings indicate that the inertial microfluidic separation of leukocytes from whole blood is fast and results in less ex vivo activation than the density-based gradient method.",

The subject characteristics are shown in Table 1. The LTB4-stimulated elastase release from PMNs isolated from patients with sepsis (3.67 \u00b1 0.91 fluorescence RU (relative units), mean \u00b1 s.e.m.) was significantly lower than that from cells from healthy subjects (9.77 \u00b1 1.21 fluorescence RU, mean \u00b1 s.e.m.)

The mean LTB4-stimulated PMN elastase release in sepsis patients increased from day 0 to day 7 (Fig. 2b). Similar to PMN elastase release, LTB4 exposure resulted in significantly lower values for superoxide anion production in PMNs from sepsis patients (day 0) (0.15 \u00b1 0.07 nmol O2\u2212 per 104 PMNs, mean \u00b1 s.e.m.) relative to healthy donors (1.58 \u00b1 0.21 nmol O2\u2212 per 104 PMNs, mean \u00b1 s.e.m.)

To determine whether IDS can identify differences between PMNs from sepsis and healthy donors, we next measured the IDP for freshly isolated PMNs exposed to PMA (20 nM) or vehicle (ethanol 0.02%) (Fig. 3a; see Methods). For these assays, the PMNs were isolated from 100 \u03bcl peripheral blood by negative selection (rather than the inertial microfluidics system) before introduction into the IDS chamber. PMN IDP was inversely correlated to electrical voltage (Supplementary Fig. 5a). When exposed to an electrical voltage of 7 MHz, PMNs incubated with PMA had a lower IDP (activated PMNs) and flow in the lower conductivity channel (\u03c3L) (Fig. 3a,b). By contrast, PMNs incubated with vehicle have a higher IDP (non-activated PMNs) and flow in the higher conductivity channel (\u03c3H) (Fig. 3a,b). When exposed to vehicle, PMNs from patients with sepsis demonstrated a significantly lower median IDP relative to PMNs from healthy donors (Fig. 3c,d). With PMA stimulation, the median IDP of PMNs from healthy donors significantly decreased to a level that approximated that of PMNs from sepsis patients (Fig. 3c,d, Supplementary Fig. 5b). The difference between the median IDP of PMNs exposed to PMA or vehicle can be expressed as \u0394med IDP (\u0394med = median IDPveh \u2212 median IDPPMA) (Fig. 3c). The \u0394med IDP of PMNs from sepsis patients (day 0) was significantly lower than the \u0394med IDP of PMNs in healthy patients (Fig. 3e). The \u0394med IDP of PMNs from sepsis patients significantly increased from day 0 to day 7 (Supplementary Fig. 6a), but the median IDP from sepsis patients had no significant changes from day 0 to day 7 (Supplementary Fig. 6b). To investigate whether PMN IDP was related to disease severity, we next determined whether the IDP correlated with clinical severity scores obtained on admission. The \u0394med IDP was inversely correlated with the SOFA score (r = \u22120.64, P = 0.019; Fig. 3f). There was a similar but not significant trend for \u0394med IDP and APACHE II score (r = \u22120.38, P = 0.29; Supplementary Fig. 6c) and median IDP was not correlated with the SOFA score (r = 0.08, P = 0.77; Supplementary Fig. 6d) and APACHE II score at day 0 (r = 0.25, P = 0.40; Supplementary Fig. 6e).",

The standard scores (that is z-scores) for CBC measures were aggregated and indicated no statistically significant difference between healthy and sepsis patients (day 0 to day 7) (Fig. 5b). As expected, the aggregate scores of clinical severity indicators, including the need for vasopressors and mechanical ventilation, as well as the APACHE II and SOFA scores did distinguish sepsis patients at presentation from healthy donors but did not significantly change until day 7 (Fig. 5c,d). Most notably, the aggregate scores of leukocyte phenotype markers (Fig. 5e,f, Supplementary Fig. 9a) and PMN functional responses (Fig. 5g,h) distinguished sepsis from healthy patients and further distinguished sepsis patients by day of illness. The aggregate scores of CD16bright PMNs and classical monocytes and PMN functional responses demonstrated a significant decrease at day 0 relative to healthy donor scores and a return to values that approximate health at day 7 (Fig. 5e\u2013h). PMN functional responses that incorporated median IDP also distinguished between sepsis and healthy patients at presentation and by day of illness (day 0 to day 7) (Supplementary Fig. 9b-c).",

In addition, the \u0394med IDP for PMNs from sepsis patients demonstrated a significant inverse correlation with SOFA score (Fig. 6e). The median IDP of PMNs from sepsis patients had no significant correlation with SOFA score (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Moreover, there was no significant correlation identified between severity indicators and other PMN functional responses (Supplementary Fig. 10b\u2013e) or monocyte subsets (Supplementary Fig. 11). The \u0394med IDP of PMNs in sepsis patients was also significantly lower in patients requiring mechanical ventilation (Fig. 6f). In this limited sample size, neither current clinical severity indicators (SOFA and APACHE II scores) nor leukocyte phenotype and functional responses were associated with mortality (Supplementary Fig. 12a\u2013k).",

Multiple groups have developed point-of-care microfluidic devices to investigate potential biomarkers in sepsis diagnosis. C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin-6, neopterin and many others have been studied extensively but provided limited utility in sepsis severity assessment and outcomes8\u201314. In a large cohort of patients, using a point-of-care microfluidic device, CD64 surface receptor expression on neutrophils was found to be predictive of patient diagnosis but was of limited use in sepsis severity assessment9. A recent study demonstrated that the measurement of patterns of neutrophil spontaneous motility in microfluidic chambers enabled the accurate diagnosis of sepsis, which suggests that the measurement of leukocyte function (rather than number) may represent a potential approach for the development of sepsis severity biomarkers15. Here we modified and demonstrated a closed-loop microfluidics platform to isolate leukocytes using microlitre quantities of peripheral blood volumes to provide an innovative biomedical engineering approach to both the label-free sample preparation of leukocytes and the study of leukocyte activation and function in a clinical context. Our approach provides evidence that leukocyte responses: are measurable in small aliquots of peripheral blood; are distinct in sepsis and healthy patients; are dynamic over time; reflect sepsis clinical severity; are more predictive of the clinical course than leukocyte count; and are differential by repeated CBC (the current clinical practice). This sample sparing approach would enable the repeated assessment of leukocyte activation and function without substantially increasing the risk for iatrogenic anaemia, which is a common problem in intensive care units16. The features described here enable its potential clinical integration.",

            "text": "Recently, microfluidic devices have been developed to enable clinical sample preparation. For example, a surface acoustic wave assisted microfluidics platform was proposed as a method to separate blood components, for example, circulating tumour cells23,24, leukocytes25,26, mesenchymal stromal cells27, bacteria28 and microvesicles29. The different electrical properties between cells can also enable the fractionation of fluid components with electrode-embedded microfluidics, for example stem cells from enzyme-digested adipose tissue30, the profiling of yeast genotypes31 and neutrophils from white blood cells22. These platforms have the advantage of obtaining a high purity separation from a small volume of sample without the use of a membrane filter. External stimuli can cause leukocyte activation, which may lead to inaccuracies in the assessment of the host response. Inertial microfluidics was introduced as a passive, label-free separation method. The fluid flow in an intermediate Reynold\u2019s number regime (~1 < Re < ~100) through a curved microchannel was used to order and align particles by their size at each lateral equilibrium position due to the balance between the inertial lift force and Dean drag force21,26,32\u201334. This technique has been applied to various clinical samples, for example the separation of circulating tumour cells35\u201339, leukocytes17,18, mesenchymal stem cells40, viruses41,42, bacteria42 and antigen-specific lymphocytes from human blood43,44. To overcome the limitations of the syringe-based operation of inertial microfluidics, our group introduced the closed-loop operation of spiral microfluidics for clinical sample preparation (neutrophil extraction from patient airway secretions)17 and virus isolation from patient blood cell contents41. Here we modified the closed-loop microfluidics platform to demonstrate the isolation of leukocytes using microlitres of peripheral blood. This approach was designed to fulfil two aspects of sample preparation: the extraction of functionally intact and relatively pure PMNs from aliquots of human blood; and the isolation of appropriate numbers of leukocytes from minimal blood volumes from humans to facilitate clinical integration.",

In this study, we found that patients with sepsis had relatively decreased LTB4-induced PMN superoxide anion production and elastase release on admission. By contrast, PMN responses to PMA were similar in sepsis and healthy patients. These findings suggest that, in sepsis patients, PMN responses to receptor-mediated soluble stimuli were uncoupled with a preserved capacity for NADPH oxidase assembly and degranulation in the presence of receptor independent stimuli. The detection of this functional distinction emphasizes the potential value of a cellular biomarker. There was a time-dependent increase in LTB4-initiated responses in sepsis from day 0 to day 7 that reflected decreasing clinical severity.",

            "text": "Cell activation can be determined by monitoring the IDP after IDS22. Previous quantifiable methods for the electrical characterization of neutrophil activation, such as patch clamping48 and electrorotation49, have a low throughput that makes it difficult to continuously characterize thousands of cells to provide clinically meaningful results. Other high-throughput electrical characterization techniques, such as microfluidic impedance cytometry50, have not been shown to be sensitive to PMN activation and, furthermore, are sensitive to size variations that may confound the analysis. The rapid quantification of activated PMNs using IDS can provide a timely indicator of host responses to sepsis progression, thus allowing faster stratification of the severity of illness and improved administration of targeted treatment. In the course of the research presented here, we found that the electrical properties correlated better with the SOFA score and mechanical ventilation than the current measures of leukocyte enumeration. Differences in the electrical properties of human PMNs are due to electrical changes in both membrane capacitance and cytoplasm conductivity during the degranulation process and a substantial increase in reactive oxygen species generation. The IDS platform enables the characterization of PMN activation in sepsis patients by monitoring the cells\u2019 natural (high-conductivity) media. In preclinical animal models, electrical cell profiles correlate with established assessments of cell activation (flow cytometry immunophenotyping)22. Here, IDS distinguished ex vivo human PMNs activated by PMA from non-activated PMNs. We used the \u0394med IDP, as it provides the quantitative IDP change that reflects the changing electrical properties according to PMN activation, with the addition of a positive control to account for variabilities in the device and sample. In healthy patients, a decreased median IDP with PMA relative to the vehicle was expressed as a \u0394med IDP. The \u0394med IDP in sepsis patients was significantly smaller because the median IDP for vehicle-exposed PMNs from patients with sepsis was already reduced compared to PMNs from healthy subjects, consistent with the notion that PMNs from sepsis patients were activated in vivo. The \u0394med IDP for PMNs from sepsis patients significantly increased from day 0 to day 7, approaching the \u0394med IDP for PMNs in healthy patients at hospital day 7. In addition, the SOFA score was inversely correlated with \u0394med IDP. Notably, the differences in flow rate through the designed inertial microfluidic and IDS devices precluded their integration, so PMNs were isolated by negative selection before IDS. However, there are a variety of ways to connect a high-flow-rate device to a low-flow-rate device. One approach, for example, is to store isolated PMNs from the spiral device in an injection loop, which can be loaded at a high flow rate, and then inject that sample into the IDS device at a lower flow rate for electrical profiling. In this fashion, the injection loop serves to bridge the flow rate mismatch between the two devices. Such integration will be one focus of future work.",

The intermediate monocyte population is of interest as, relative to other monocyte subsets, these cells display proinflammatory properties54 and are associated with risk for acute inflammatory diseases, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)52. Consistent with these reported changes, we identified an expansion of intermediate monocytes and concomitant reduction in the percentages of classical monocytes in patients admitted with sepsis (day 0). The APACHE II score was inversely correlated with the classical monocyte percentage.

In sepsis there is only rarely a failure to obtain source control of the infection. More commonly, an overly exuberant host immune response leading to multiorgan system injury causes excess morbidity and mortality in sepsis. We lack clinical diagnostics for the early and rapid assessment of the nature and intensity of the host response, so this project was designed to monitor circulating leukocyte activation and function as relevant indicators of the host response to address this important unmet clinical need and, in the longer term, to enable new therapeutic strategies that target the host response. In addition, this study has identified several leukocyte parameters that correlate with sepsis severity and could serve as leukocyte biomarkers for early stratification, on initial assessment, and for disease progression, with repeated measurement.

Four spiral channels were parallelized with individual inlets and common outlets (Fig. 1a).

Further enhancement of throughput was achieved by stacking more channels within the tolerable dead volume limits of the assay.

Both complexes were placed into the oven and annealed for 6 h. Holes for the fluidic access of microchannels were punched with 4 mm biopsy punches (Integra Miltex).

After obtaining informed consent, peripheral blood (500 \u00b5l) was freshly obtained from 10 healthy volunteers and 18 patients with sepsis within 72 h of admission to the Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital medical intensive care unit (day 0) and on days 3 and 7 thereafter of their hospitalization; it was collected in EDTA-containing vacutainer tubes. Sepsis was defined according to the Sepsis-3 guidelines6 and SOFA scores were calculated as previously described59. Healthy volunteers reported general health and no prescription or over-the-counter medications within the 2 weeks before enrolment. A fraction of the freshly obtained peripheral blood (50 \u03bcl) was added to the sample tube containing 50 ml buffer solution (PBS without Mg2+ and Ca2+, Gibco) and connected to the circulation pump (see above). The pump flow was set to 12 ml min\u22121 and the flow resistance was adjusted to a 4.0 ml min\u22121 outer-wall outlet flow rate using the pinch valve. When the sample volume reached 7.5 ml, an additional 35 ml of PBS\u2212/\u2212 was added to the sample tube for further leukocyte enrichment. When the sample volume reached 1 ml, the flow resistance was increased and the circulation pump was stopped. Next, air was introduced to recover the residual fluid in the tubing and channels. For comparison with microfluidic cell sorting, granulocytes were isolated from healthy subjects by density gradient centrifugation over Histopaque 1077 (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) and Histopaque 1119 (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) as in ref. 60.",
