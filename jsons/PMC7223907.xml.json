TWOC also face multiple types of health disparities and disproportionally high rates of HIV prevalence [5\u20137]. Individual and structural-level factors, including intersecting systems of oppression such as classism, racism, as well as institutional policies, such as immigration laws [8, 9], have been shown to interfere with linkage, engagement, and retention in care among TWOC living with HIV [10, 11]. Furthermore, mistrust of the health care system due to the lack of culturally responsive and gender affirming services, and past negative experiences of stigma and discrimination by health care providers influence their engagement in care.[10\u201313].",

            "text": "To date, a small number of HIV prevention group interventions have been implemented with transgender women regardless of their HIV status. These interventions created safe spaces for participants to discuss gender issues, sexual risk, depression and substance use, with modest reductions in HIV risk and/or an increase in HIV knowledge among participants. One of these interventions also documented an increase in individual empowerment for some of the participants [14]. In addition to those interventions, a pilot group intervention to address the role of prior trauma in HIV prevention and treatment among TWOC was found to be feasible and acceptable, with positive coping among participants [15]. SISTA, an evidence-based, social skills-building, group-level intervention originally designed to reduce HIV risk behaviors and build gender and ethnic pride among African American (AA) heterosexual ciswomen, has been adapted by different organizations to be implemented with transgender women, including TWISTA for AA transgender women in Chicago and BACAHU for Latina transgender women in San Juan, Puerto Rico [16]. To the best of our knowledge, however, these interventions have not been rigorously evaluated. While the interventions above focused on HIV prevention, there has been little research about the needs of transgender women living with HIV to engage in care [17]. Grounded in the models of Health Care Empowerment and Gender Affirmation, Healthy Divas is a clinical trial currently being implemented to optimize engagement in HIV care for transgender women living with HIV. The Healthy Divas intervention is a combination of six individual sessions with a peer counselor and a peer-led group workshop with other transgender women, an HIV primary care provider, and a transgender health care provider [18].",

The HRSA/SPNS initiative and the nine interventions have been described in detail elsewhere [19, 20]. In brief, the interventions were all distinct, and included either new programs or services, and/or complemented or enhanced already existing programming at the sites. Eight of the interventions included navigation services funded by the initiative. In addition, six of those interventions provided either drop-in, educational, community building, and/or support groups funded by the initiative. Clinical demonstration sites generally referred participants internally for medical care, while community-based sites referred them to external medical settings.",

Social (support and acceptance), psychological (wellbeing) and medical (hormone use, surgery) gender affirmation has been associated with lower depression and higher self-esteem among transgender women [25]. Specifically among a sample of AA transgender women at risk for HIV or living with HIV, social gender affirmation was associated with greater personal competence, self-acceptance, and positive mental health outcomes [26]. The provision of gender-affirming services has been theorized as a facilitator and as a social determinant of health [27]. Gender-affirming services may positively impact TWOC\u2019s perceptions of healthcare and contribute to their engagement and retention in HIV care. Quantitative data from this SPNS initiative found that interventions that boost gender affirmation and healthcare empowerment may improve viral suppression among transgender women of color living with HIV [28].",

The first two authors conducted all interviews and analyzed the data. Fifteen interviews (five with staff and 10 with participants) were conducted in Spanish by the first author, who is bilingual, considering that interviewees felt more comfortable expressing themselves in their native language. Data collection took place between November 2014 and July 2016. We asked the sites to select a diverse sample of up to six TWOC participating in the interventions for us to interview, including participants who were newly diagnosed with HIV, participants who reengaged in HIV care during the interventions, and those who were participating in the interventions but were not currently engaged in HIV care. We selected staff for interviews based on their role to include project directors and interventionists implementing the interventions.",

In that respect, the social concordance [45] of the interventionists and their participants regarding gender and HIV status was important. Interventionists taking up the role of mothers, sisters and confidantes providing advice and support may have a precedent in informal kinship relationships within transgender communities. In these types of chosen family associations, older or more experienced transgender women may assume those roles, as well as initiating other transgender women in sex work or silicone or hormone injections [46]. Intervention groups engaged participants to reinforce the importance of health and HIV care and/or complemented the one-on-one work of the interventionists. In addition, intervention groups created a safe space that contributed to develop or enhance friendship networks and informal kinship relationships based on trust and mutual support among participating TWOC. The fact that participants promoted the interventions in their communities provide an indication that they deemed the intervention services appropriate to the needs of TWOC, considering that exchange of support and information about available services though social networks has been identified as important among TWOC [47].",
