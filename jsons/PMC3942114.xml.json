            "text": "Virus infections of the respiratory tract are the most common cause of viral diseases worldwide ranging from common colds to life-threatening pneumonia [1]. A large number of both RNA and DNA viruses uses the respiratory tract to initiate host infection. Infection may be restricted to or most evident in certain sections of the airway system such as trachea, bronchi or alveoli. For some viruses, the respiratory tract may just serve as a primary entry site from where infection spreads to other organs or tissues. All these viruses encounter the respiratory epithelium as a primary barrier against invading pathogens. This barrier is composed of differentiated epithelial cells that have different functions. An important defence strategy is the mucociliary clearance system. While some epithelial cells are specialized to produce and release mucins, other cells are equipped with cilia that enable them to contribute to the transport of the mucus out of the respiratory tract.",

            "text": "Viruses differ in their ability to infect the differentiated respiratory epithelial cells. Productive infection by human influenza viruses has been reported to preferentially occur in mucus-producing cells [2]. Other viruses, e.g. parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3), may have a preference for ciliated cells [3]. Characteristic features of differentiated epithelial cells such as ciliary activity are not maintained in any of the available immortalized cell lines. Analysis of such cells requires primary cell cultures. When tracheal or bronchial epithelial cells are grown on filter supports under air-liquid interface (ALI) conditions, they differentiate and acquire properties of specialized cells, i.e. mucus production or ciliary activity [4,5]. Another culture system for differentiated respiratory epithelial cells are precision-cut lung slices (PCLS), where the epithelial cells are maintained in their original setting. In addition to mucus production and ciliary activity, this culture system provides another characteristic feature of the airway, bronchoconstriction. As submucosal cells are also present in PCLS, they can be included in the investigation [6-8].",

            "text": "Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in feedlot cattle. The disease is considered as a multifactorial disorder caused by a combination of viral and bacterial pathogens together with environmental risk factors. The most important viral pathogens associated with BRD are bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV3) and bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), a member of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae[9-12]. BRSV and BPIV3 are paramyxoviruses that use the fusion protein F on the cell surface to mediate fusion of the viral envelope with the cellular membrane and thus to get the viral genome into the cell. Prior to fusion, the virions attach to the cell surface. Attachment of PIV3 is accomplished by another surface protein, the HN protein which interacts with sialic acid-containing cellular glycoconjugates and thus binds to cells in a sialic acid-dependent manner [13,14]. Attachment of human RSV (HRSV) can be mediated by the surface protein G that binds to glycosaminoglycan structures [15] as well as by the fusion protein F that may bind to both glycosaminoglycans as well as to a specific protein receptor [16,17]. Nucleolin has recently been reported to promote infection though the authors did not exclude the possibility that another so far unknown protein may serve as a receptor for entry of HRSV [18]. No data on receptors for BRSV have been reported yet. Alphaherpesviruses like BHV-1, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) or pseudorabies virus use the surface glycoprotein gC for initial attachment to heparan sulphate structures. For entry, virions have to bind to a specific receptor (nectin-1 or herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM)) which is accomplished by the surface protein gD. The subsequent fusion reaction is mediated by the combined action of the surface proteins gB/gD/gH/gL [19,20].",

For this purpose, BAEC were grown for about four weeks under ALI conditions to build up a polarized and pseudostratified epithelium. Cells were infected by BPIV3, BRSV-GFP or BHV-1-GFP at an MOI of 0.1 and analyzed two (BPIV3 and BHV-1-GFP) or three (BRSV-GFP) days post infection (dpi) for the presence of infected cells. As described in earlier studies [7], BPIV3 efficiently infected the respiratory epithelium. Co-staining of \u03b2-tubulin indicated that ciliated cells were the target cells (Figure 1A). On the other hand, infection by BRSV-GFP was very inefficient (Figure 1B); only a few infected cells were detectable and those cells were identified as ciliated cells using an antibody directed against \u03b2-tubulin. Only occasionally non-ciliated cells were infected by BRSV-GFP. When BHV-1-GFP was applied to the apical surface, the epithelium was found to be refractory to infection (Figure 1C). Not a single infected cell was detectable at two dpi; if the incubation time was increased up to five days, only occasionally infected cells were found. The same result was obtained when the titer was enhanced tenfold and infection was monitored up to five days. Only when an MOI of 10 was applied, a few cells were infected and appearance of infected foci suggested that infection spread to adjacent cells (see Additional file 1). Infection of BAEC by the three bovine viruses was also evaluated by determining the kinetics of virus production (Figure 2). Apical release of infectious BPIV3 was detected at 12 hours post infection (hpi) and increased exponentially by 24 hpi; the maximum infectivity titer of ~7 \u00d7 105 FFU/mL was determined at 96 hpi. BRSV-GFP was detectable in the supernatant only at 48 hpi and the maximum titer of 3 \u00d7 104 FFU/mL was reached after seven days. The apical release of infectious BHV-1-GFP was as slow as that of BRSV-GFP but proceeded only to a maximum titer of 2.5 \u00d7 103 FFU/mL. Basolateral release of all three viruses was below detection level. For any of the three viruses, we did not observe a general decrease in the transepithelial resistance values during the course of the experiment. Despite some fluctuation of individual TEER values post-infection and variability between individual trans-wells, apical infection of differentiated cultures did not affect the integrity of the epithelium (see Additional file 2A).",

By contrast, the disruption of the epithelial barrier had no effect on the efficiency of BRSV-GFP infection or on the cell type infected by this virus. Virus titration revealed that the yield of BHV-1-GFP released into the supernatant was increased up to 200 fold at 48 hpi.

However, infection proceeded faster when the cells had been pretreated with EGTA (Figure 5B). The different efficiencies of BRSV-GFP and BHV-1-GFP in the infection of EGTA-treated ALI cultures were also evident in the recovery of the transepithelial resistance which took 48 h in the case of BRSV-GFP and 120 h in the case of BHV-1-GFP.",

They comprise cell types like ciliated cells that are important for airway function and cannot be cultured as immortalized cells. Using these culture systems, it is possible to determine which of the different cell types is susceptible to infection. These results may be different from those obtained with immortalized cells. A striking example is BRSV which infects almost all immortalized cells [18,23], whereas airway epithelial cells are rather refractory to infection ([7], this paper). Membrane-grown respiratory epithelial cells cultured under air-liquid interface conditions undergo mucociliary differentiation to generate a pseudostratified epithelium including ciliated cells, secretory cells and progenitor cells. They allow targeted access of reagents or microorganisms to the apical and basal membrane. Though we succeeded in establishing ALI cultures from bovine airway epithelial cells, most studies were performed so far with human cells. Establishing ALI cultures for cells of different species is still challenging [24,25]. The alternative culture system for differentiated respiratory epithelial cells, PCLS, can be applied to lungs from different species [7,8,26,27].

Therefore, it was of interest to compare the entry strategies of these viruses. BPIV3 efficiently infected the airway epithelial cells using sialic acids on the apical surface as a receptor determinant for virus entry from the apical side. As virus egress also proceeds via the apical plasma membrane, BPIV3 - like human PIV3 (HPIV3) - has the characteristics of several other viruses that cause a localized infection of the respiratory tract, e.g. influenza viruses [3,28,29]. It remains to be further elucidated why BPIV3 preferentially targets the ciliated cells. This is a question that can be addressed in the future with culture systems for differentiated airway epithelial cells.",

            "text": "BHV-1 showed a completely different infection pattern. When BHV-1-GFP was applied to the apical side of the well-differentiated airway epithelial cells, infected cells were detected only occasionally. Recently, an explant culture system derived from the upper trachea of cows was used to analyze BHV-1 infection. Single sites of infection were detected in the epithelium when the virus was applied at 107 TCID50/mL [30]. This infectious dose is about 100-fold higher than that required for efficient infection by BPIV3. Thus, differentiated epithelial cells from both the proximal trachea and the bronchi are rather resistant to infection by BHV-1. Successful infection required the access to the basal side of the epithelium either after opening of the tight junctions by calcium depletion or after mechanical injuring of the cell monolayer. Infection studies with ALI cultures indicated that the cells that are sensitive to BHV-1-GFP infection are not the differentiated epithelial cells but cells with the phenotype of basal cells, i.e. the progenitor cells of the differentiated epithelial cells. Also in PCLS, basal cells were found to be the primary site of infection. When the inoculation time was increased up to one week, virus was also found in the periphery of the slice, and the distribution pattern suggests direct cell-to-cell spread. This infection pattern could not be predicted from studies with polarized immortalized cells. Our results most closely resemble those reported for polarized MDCK cells where infection was not possible via the apical surface, but via the basolateral side after opening of the tight junctions or after injuring the cell monolayer [31,32]. However, this cell system could not reveal the preference for the basal cell phenotype. Other studies with polarized cells reported virus entry from both sides [33,34] or preferentially via the apical membrane [35]. These conflicting reports underline the importance of infection studies with differentiated airway epithelial cells. From our results, the question arises how BHV-1 gets across the epithelial barrier. A model that has been proposed for HSV-1 suggests entry through small lesions within the epithelium [31,32,34,36]. Further possible explanations will be discussed below.",

            "text": "A third infection pattern was observed when differentiated epithelial cells were infected with BRSV-GFP. Though BRSV-GFP - like BPIV3 - preferentially infected ciliated cells, the overall efficiency of infection was much lower. Whereas BPIV3 readily infected airway epithelial cells, only single BRSV-infected cells were observed even when the virus was applied at an increased MOI. The difference in infection efficiency was also evident from the amount of infectious virus released by the infected cultures. The titers of infectious progeny BRSV-GFP were up to 600-fold lower when compared to BPIV3. In contrast to BHV-1-GFP infection, the relative resistance of the airway epithelium against BRSV-GFP infection could not be overcome by opening the tight junctions or by injuring the cell monolayer. The infection pattern observed with BRSV-GFP resembles that reported for HRSV. A previous study reporting the release of a substantial amount of progeny virus had applied an unusual high multiplicity of infection [37]. Later on, it was reported also for HRSV that airway epithelial cells are infected with low efficiency [38,39]. A striking feature of the BRSV infection is the susceptibility of submucosal cells to infection. Some of these cells have morphologies that resemble those of dendritic cells. Others were located within the epithelium lining the alveolar lumen. Replication of BRSV within the alveolar epithelium in both type I and type II pneumocytes has been reported in an ultrastructural analysis of BRSV-infected calves [40]. Staining of PCLS for the presence of anti-TTF-1, which was identified as a marker for type II pneumocytes in sheep and swine [41,42], demonstrated that type II pneumocytes are susceptible to infection by BRSV-GFP. Alveolar cells that were negative for TTF-1 were also infected by BRSV-GFP. These latter cells had a flattened morphology that is characteristic for type I pneumocytes. Therefore, both type I and type II pneumocytes appear to be susceptible to infection by BRSV-GFP. Unfortunately, the identity of the infected cells in the submucosal area could not be determined. Immunological reagents available for bovine cells are limited and those few that were suitable for staining of PCLS did not provide an unambiguous result.",

            "text": "As differentiated airway epithelial cells are refractory to infection by BRSV-GFP and BHV-1-GFP, it remains to be elucidated how these viruses get across the epithelial barrier. As mentioned above, passage through leaky sites within the epithelial monolayer is a possibility proposed for HSV-1. An alternative explanation has been suggested for measles virus. Here, the major receptor, SLAM, is present on lymphoid cells but absent from epithelial cells. The recently identified measles receptor on epithelial cells, nectin 4, has a polarized surface distribution enabling infection via the basolateral side but not via the apical plasma membrane. Therefore, it has been suggested that measles virus infection is initiated in alveolar macrophages or dendritic cells which are used as a ferry through the epithelial barrier [43,44]. We cannot exclude that dendritic cells that uptake antigen from the airway lumen via their dendrites capture BRSV and carry infection to the submucosal infection sites as well. In-vitro studies have demonstrated RSV infection and replication within dendritic cells [45]. Also it has been suggested that the virus may persist in lymphoid or other tissues [12,46,47]. A further way to get across the epithelium without infecting the epithelial cells is transcytosis. This entry option has been shown for several viruses, e.g. for Epstein-Barr virus to get across the oral epithelium ([48], and references therein). There are no data available supporting transcytosis as an entry strategy for BHV-1 and BRSV. An alternative explanation of the infection pattern of BRSV and BHV-1 may be that the viruses enter differentiated bronchial epithelial cells without immediate initiation of replication. We do not have any evidence for this possibility, because BRSV and BHV-1 infection of differentiated bronchial epithelial cells was not enhanced even when the infection time was extended to seven days.",

            "text": "We would like to suggest another entry strategy that may apply to BRSV and BHV-1. Both viruses have been associated with the bovine respiratory disease complex, a multifactorial disease that involves the interplay of different factors such as stress and microbial co-infections. Bacterial pathogens associated with BRD are Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida or Mycoplasma bovis[12,49,50]. Infection of the epithelium by either of these microorganisms may induce a response reaction in the epithelial cells that make them susceptible to virus infection. For example, if the cells are responding by expressing suitable virus receptors that are otherwise absent from the cell surface, BRSV or BHV-1 may initiate infection. Thus, in the future it will be interesting to analyze the interaction of bacterial pathogens with differentiated airway epithelial cells and to determine whether bacterial infection predisposes the epithelium to virus infection. The analysis of the entry mechanism of the three bovine viruses is hampered by the fact that suitable antibodies against bovine nectin-1, the receptor for BHV-1, are not available commercially and the receptor for BRSV has not been identified. However, when bacterial co-infection increases the susceptibility to infection by BRSV, this approach may help to identify the receptor for BRSV. Also, our finding that pneumocytes are susceptible to BRSV-infection, may be helpful in this respect. Taken together, our data provide new insights in the airway infection by bovine respiratory viruses that may help not only to understand the pathogenicity of viruses involved in BRDC but also to develop new intervention strategies.",
