            "text": "The interpretation of the images is critical to the use of EIT. Our six scenarios can be interpreted as follows:Asthma: Gas trapping is a difficult problem in such patients and quantifying the extent of the problem is impossible. It only becomes apparent when ventilation becomes compromised, and then it is difficult to know whether this change in ventilation is due to clinical deterioration, or the respiratory dynamics. Use of EIT gives instant, breath by breath feedback on the global chest expansion, allowing pre-emptive management of incipient gas trapping problems.Ventilation weaning and effects of disconnection. The patient will not display clinical signs soon after a ventilator change: it may take many hours for this to manifest. However, it can be anticipated that problems will arise if the patient is unable to maintain adequate lung expansion with the ventilatory settings which have been applied. If the global end-expiratory lung volume keeps dropping after the (expected) initial volume loss, then problems can be anticipated in the short to medium term. A patient who can hold a stable expansion after a ventilatory parameter change is likely to have a greater chance of medium term stability. Current monitoring techniques are poor at predicting rapidity of atelectasis and lung collapse after weaning. Knowledge of this may help to predict whether a patient is ready for extubation. The first trace shows a patient whose lungs cannot yet cope with a loss of PEEP, and is not ready for extubation. The second shows a patient who can rapidly restore lung volume and maintain adequate expansion making him suitable for extubation.Sequential lobar collapse. Repositioning a patient with unilateral lobar collapse can cause respiratory instability, leading to a practice of minimal handling and reducing the frequency of unstable episodes. Clinical examination is inaccurate in a small chest with many added sounds. Chest radiography gives good knowledge of lobar collapse, but that may lead to worsening of gases and there is the added concern of radiation dosage. The use of EIT allows for monitoring of lung inflation in real time and ensure that significant areas of dependent collapse are avoided limiting respiratory instability due to repositioning. Direct visualisation identifies lung collapse rapidly making reinflation easier.Targeted Physiotherapy. Constant EIT monitoring allowed us to monitor lung expansion without resorting to frequent chest radiographs. The physiotherapy team were able to quickly identify an adverse effect of treatment and adjust their plan accordingly. With standard monitoring it may not have been apparent why objective markers were deteriorating following airway clearance.Pleural effusion. Chest X-Ray, and sonography, show a depth of fluid but do not give a sense of how much this fluid affects the lung inflation. Using live regional ventilation information allows precise visual quantification of this, meaning that clinical decisions can be based on more accurate information. In this case, the chest drain was high risk, but with the addition of EIT data this risk was felt to be worth taking. Cases of pneumothorax or foreign body would have a similar EIT picture, with the ability to quantify which areas of lung are non-functional and to what degree.PEEP optimisation. Establishing the optimal PEEP in invasively ventilated patients is a challenge; the balance between collapse and over distension is difficult to assess and no method has been shown to prevent Ventilator Induced Lung Injury. EIT can be used to evaluate the regional compliance changes at different levels of PEEP, measuring areas of collapse and over distention during a PEEP trial. Both collapse and overdistension are detrimental to the patient. Knowledge of the effects of the PEEP to the patient allows the clinician to titrate it to produce minimal detrimental effects.",
