These observations are reassuring after concerns had been raised about the possibility that blockers of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system (RAAS) could predispose individuals to severe COVID-19. Although the findings from these studies, which were published in NEJM, Lancet and JAMA Cardiology, should be considered exploratory given that all were observational, the findings were consistent across the different patient populations and the different study designs.",

Logistic-regression multivariate analyses showed that age >65 years, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and current smoking were independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. Conversely, use of ACE inhibitors (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.20\u20130.54) or ARBs (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.87\u20131.74) was not associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death.",

By contrast, a secondary exploratory analysis by Mehta and colleagues showed a higher risk of hospitalization among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were taking ACE inhibitors (OR 1.84) or ARBs (OR 1.61). However, the investigators, and the authors of accompanying editorials, caution that these associations should be considered with extreme caution because of potential unmeasured confounding given the observational design of the studies and the small number of patients in the secondary exploratory analysis.",
