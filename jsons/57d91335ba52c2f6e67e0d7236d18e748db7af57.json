While initially fever, cough and dyspnea were thought to be the dominant symptoms, other unusual presentations of COVID-19 such as altered olfactory function have been increasingly recognized. Recently, isolated anosmia/hyposmia is reported as a marker of COVID-19. The onset of anosmia was sudden in majority of the cases and most had a concomitant decrease in taste sensation (1) .",

The underlying cause is primarily mucosal congestion, which leads to nasal obstruction and conductive olfactory loss (2) . While anosmia in the majority of cases resolves once the clinical symptoms and obstruction subside, some patients are left with permanent anosmia due to virus-induced sensory neuronal damage known as postviral olfactory loss (3) . The pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2induced anosmia is not fully understood. Nonetheless, cellular factors for SARS-CoV-2 entry (i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2) are expressed in the olfactory epithelium and not in the olfactory sensory neurons, indicating olfactory epithelium as the putative entry site of SARS-CoV-2 (4).",

Despite the sudden onset of a complete loss of olfactory function, we found normal OB volume without abnormal signal intensity in the OB and tract and no sign of nasal congestion (Fig 1) . This finding is consistent with prior reports in 2002-2003 of SARS-CoV-induced anosmia, where OB MRI similarly did not demonstrate abnormal findings (6) .",
