The non-sentinel specimens were tested by conventional RT-PCR to detect in fl uenza A and in the case of positive specimens -one-step real-time RT-PCR to detect the pandemic virus A(H1N1)2009. In 145 (18.2%) cases, infections with the pandemic virus were con fi rmed, with the highest number in patients aged 15-25. In 45% of the con fi rmed cases, a history of travel to other countries was registered. The most common symptoms were fever \u00b3 38\u00b0C (72.7%), cough (50%), sore throat, and myalgia (26.1%). In 40.7% of the swabbed patients, clinical and epidemiological criteria for the novel in fl uenza A(H1N1)2009, set by the European Commission, were met. There were, however, specimens from persons without any reasonable indication for testing for the pandemic virus, specimens collected incorrectly, and documentation without basic information. These weaknesses resulted in unnecessary costs and overload of health care units. An improvement should be achieved in the area of communication between different pandemic players in the future. More attention is also needed to ensure that requirements and recommendations are known and used.",

Detailed instructions regarding collection of clinical material, including its storage and transport, were prepared by the NIC and available on the website. Similarly, appropriate information was available on the website of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate and the Ministry of Health. Phone information was also provided by the staff of the NIC and the National IHR Focal Point. Clinical materials were nasal and throat swabs, less often bronchoalveolar liquid, or tracheal washings. The NIC performed diagnostics of the pandemic in fl uenza A(H1N1)2009 virus by nucleic acid ampli fi cation techniques. RNA was extracted from a specimen volume of 140 m L with QIAamp RNA Mini Viral Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instruction. As the fi rst step, conventional one-step reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was done to detect M gene of in fl uenza virus A using Transcriptor One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) and the following sets of primers: until December 2009 primers M30F (TTCTAACCGAGGTCGAAACG) and M264R2 (ACAAAGCGTCTACGCTGCAG) were used (WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on In fl uenza, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan) and since December 2009 the modi fi ed primers were used:",

A formal cooperation was maintained with WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and there were informal contacts with the members of the WHO Global In fl uenza Surveillance Network (GISN) and the European In fl uenza Surveillance Network (EISN). Certainly, cooperation with the most important national bodies was also in place, including the Ministry of Health, the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate, and the Government Center for Security. The NIC regularly participated in the meetings of the National In fl uenza Pandemic Committee providing scienti fi c background and advice on the interventions or recommendations that should be prepared for physicians, laboratory workers, and the community. In the fi rst step, the NIC prepared detailed instructions regarding the collection of clinical specimens (types of specimens, technical ways of their collection, the optimal time for specimen collection, storage and transport conditions, etc.) that were available on the website of the NIPH-NIH and on other relevant websites. Moreover, staff of the NIC was able to respond to any questions regarding the diagnostics of the pandemic virus and in the fi rst months of the pandemic, until the end of July 2009, this type of information, along with the diagnostics, was given to all interested parties on a 24-h basis. Most of the specimens (80.8%) tested by the NIC were from outside the sentinel in fl uenza surveillance network, i.e. , mainly from hospitals. This resulted from the recommendations of the Minister of Health, the National Adviser for the Infectious Diseases, the National Adviser for Epidemiology, and other members of the National In fl uenza Pandemic Committee. According to them, all patients meeting clinical criteria and epidemiological criteria of the infection with the novel in fl uenza virus A(H1N1)2009 had to be admitted to hospital infectious wards and the hospitals were responsible for the specimen collection and sending for laboratory testing. Since August 3, 2009, the above recommendations were modi fi ed and patients not severely ill were treated at home. This change of the recommendations also explained a decrease of the number of specimens received by the NIC since week 33/2009 33/ (August 10-16, 2009 ). This decrease also resulted from the fact that laboratories of the VSESs gradually became able to perform laboratory diagnostics of A(H1N1)2009 virus. Thus, since August 2009, the NIC played mainly a role of a national reference laboratory verifying questionable results and coordinating the sentinel in fl uenza surveillance system. It is interesting that following the decrease above outlined, a secondary increase in the number of non-sentinel specimens between weeks 45-48/2009 was observed. This situation could be partially associated with a signi fi cant EC epidemiological criteria met when at least one of the following three occurred in 7 days before disease onset:",

The authors also show that the highest proportion of positive cases among all specimens collected in a given age group was present in patients up to 25 years of age (29.7% of positive specimens in 0-4 years old; 31.4% in 5-14 years old, and 23% in 15-25 years old subjects).",

The fi nding of this study that the most affected group was patients aged up to 25 may also be related to summer holidays. During 9 weeks of the holiday time, 52% of all non-sentinel specimens from a 67-week long period of analysis were collected. The present study shows that 45.5% of infected patients had a history of travel to other countries earlier affected by the pandemic in fl uenza virus. It is also a reasonable assumption that young people were more likely to travel than older ones. It is also known that at least to mid-August 2009 all con fi rmed in fl uenza cases in Poland, i.e., those diagnosed at the NIC and VSESs laboratories were imported or linked with the imported cases. A similar situation was observed in other European countries, while a sustained virus transmission at a national level was observed in Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom.",

We also analyzed vaccination status of the swabbed patients regarding seasonal in fl uenza vaccination in the epidemic season 2008/2009 and 2009/2010. These seasonal vaccines did not provide any protection against the A(H1N1)2009 pandemic virus. Nevertheless, it was interesting to fi nd out how many of the swabbed patients were vaccinated with the seasonal vaccine, especially taking into account a strong interest of the community in acquiring the pandemic vaccine, on the one hand, and a low seasonal in fl uenza vaccination rate in the general Polish population, on the other hand. The results show that barely 7.3% of the swabbed patients were vaccinated. The vaccination rate was no different among the positive cases, amounting to 6.1%. These values are similar to the seasonal in fl uenza vaccination rates registered for a few epidemic seasons in the total population in Poland. In the epidemic season 2008/2009 barely 5.2% of the total Polish population was vaccinated against in fl uenza, in 2009/2010 -5.5%, and in 2010/2011 -5.0% (Brydak 2010 (Brydak , 2011 . According to the European Union's Council Recommendation 2009/1019/EU of December 22, 2009, all member states should prepare and implement national, regional, and local plans or appropriate policies to improve seasonal in fl uenza vaccination coverage to be able to achieve a target of 75% vaccination coverage in the older age groups and, if possible, also in other risk groups and healthcare workers, preferably by the season 2014 /2015 (European Council 2009 ) . In Poland, there is no speci fi c national program for human seasonal in fl uenza. There is a National Health Program prepared for the years 2007-2015 and one of its strategic objectives is to increase the effectiveness of prevention against infectious diseases and infections. One of the priorities of this program is to reduce the incidence of infectious diseases that are preventable by vaccinations. Nevertheless, in fl uenza is not mentioned in the program by name (National Health Program for years 2007 -2015 . A low interest in in fl uenza prophylaxis causes that there is still much to do to increase in fl uenza vaccination coverage in Poland.",

The de fi nition determines that a case under investigation is any person meeting both clinical and epidemiological criteria. Certainly, the use of this case de fi nition has been important, particularly in the fi rst months of the pandemic when there was no sustained transmission of the virus observed and the majority of the cases were imported. The results of this study show that the above case de fi nition has not been known or used by many physicians who collected clinical specimens and sent it to the NIC. Both types of criteria were met in 40.7% of the swabbed patients. It is also known that among patients with the laboratory con fi rmed infection, clinical and epidemiological criteria were met in 56.0% of them, while among non-infected patients -in 38.1% of them. These results con fi rm that collection of specimens from patients meeting both types of criteria could increase a probability to single out persons really infected with the pandemic virus. The EC case de fi nition was available in Polish on the most important websites providing information to physicians and the community during the pandemic, and in the recommendations prepared for physicians by the Minister of Health, the National Adviser for the Infectious Diseases and the National Adviser for Epidemiology. Therefore, there is a question of whether distribution of this information was poor and ineffective or physicians just did not use the information in practice. The problem was repeatedly discussed during the meetings of the National Pandemic Committee. There is a probability that physicians acted under strong pressure put out by patients and consequently tried to avoid any negative reactions. Nevertheless, testing the specimens collected from patients who did not meet both epidemiological and clinical criteria resulted in unnecessary costs and overload of laboratory staff and healthcare workers. Even when transmission of the pandemic virus was already sustained and con fi rmed in the Polish community, laboratory diagnostics should be performed for patients meeting clinical criteria and preferably for patients from the risk groups or with a severe course of the disease, according to WHO recommendations (WHO 2009h ) . The experience of the NIC shows that some specimens have been collected from asymptomatic patients, e.g., from seven healthcare workers from the same hospital department who had no symptoms, but had contact with a con fi rmed case. Moreover, these healthcare workers asked the NIC to perform diagnostics for in fl uenza A(H1N1)2009 and for in fl uenza B, despite the fact that in the con fi rmed case infection with the pandemic variant was diagnosed. This examples show the lack of knowledge on the nature of in fl uenza viruses, even among healthcare workers.",
