            "text": "The best diagnostics and therapeutics for diarrheal diseases have been developed based on an understanding of the basic pathophysiology of the pathogens involved (Figure 1\nand Table 1). Upper small bowel infections are relatively noninvasive and noninflammatory, causing watery diarrhea. Typically described as secretory, this type of diarrhea results from increased chloride secretion, decreased sodium absorption, or increased mucosal permeability. Cholera, the prototype of secretory diarrhea, is caused by the enterotoxin of Vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin). Cholera toxin binds to the epithelial receptor GM1 to activate adenylyl cyclase, which produces cyclic adenosine 3\u2032,5\u2032 monophosphate (cAMP). Continuous cAMP production activates chloride channels, resulting in unabated water and electrolyte secretion that leads to voluminous watery diarrhea.4 Similar to V cholerae, enterotoxigenic E coli (ETEC; the main cause of traveler's diarrhea) produce enterotoxins that activate adenylate or guanylate, causing chloride secretion to the intestinal lumen. In addition, impaired sodium absorption and intestinal permeability have been implicated in this process.5, 6 Other pathogens that cause secretory diarrhea have pathogenic mechanisms that include increased ion secretion, impaired absorption secondary to microvillus blunting, or disrupted intercellular junctions.",

Selective agars allow culture of specific Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, Yersinia, and Campylobacter species. Isolation of cultured organisms is still an invaluable tool for determining sensitivity to antimicrobial agents in clinical settings and for identifying specific strains, virulence factors, or toxins during investigations of outbreaks. In some instances, such as in diagnosis of patients with E coli\u2013induced diarrhea, colony-based techniques that use serotyping or HEp-2 adherence assays are used. These traditional methods for differentiating E coli strains are less sensitive than PCR analyses of isolates or stool samples; they are also a challenge when the sample produces few colonies, such as a sample from a patient with early-phase gastroenteritis.11 Bacterial genes can be detected in stool samples with the use of molecular diagnostic techniques, although this method is still limited to research settings. For other pathogens it is more important to identify the toxins than the organisms themselves; this is the case for the enterotoxigenic Vibrios and E coli, as well as the shiga toxin of enterohemorrhagic E coli (EHEC), which is produced by more E coli strains than the classic, sorbitol-negative O157:H7. Furthermore, C difficile produces toxins A and B. Many E coli and C difficile isolates do not produce these toxins and are therefore not pathogens. So detection of the toxins is actually more relevant to diagnosis than simply culturing the organism.",

Although microscopy has the advantage of low cost, its sensitivity depends on the burden of infection, the freshness of the specimen, and the experience level of the microscopist. Stains are used to improve detection of specific organisms. Coccidian parasites can be visualized with a variety of stains, including modified Ziehl\u2013Neelsen, Kinyoun acid-fast, Auramine-rhodamine, Gomori's trichrome, or Giemsa. Cyclospora and Isospora typically autofluoresce; therefore, they can be detected by epifluorescence microscopy. Each organism can be identified through its size and shape: Cryptosporidium are round or oval and approximately 4\u20137\u03bcm in diameter; Cyclospora are about twice the size of Cryptosporidium; Isospora are ellipsoid and approximately 10\u201320 \u03bcm by 20\u201333 \u03bcm in size. Fluorescence-labeled antibodies against specific parasites have improved the sensitivity and specificity of epifluorescence microscopy analyses to 98%\u2013100%.12 Many laboratories have replaced diagnostic methods, based on microscopy of fecal samples, with more sensitive and specific (and less observer-dependent) enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) methods; ELISA is used to detect protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium in fecal samples. PCR analysis can detect most protozoan infections and is more sensitive than antibody detection methods,13, 14, 15 although these assays are still not performed routinely in the clinic.",

However, rotavirus is the leading cause of diarrheal-associated death in children younger than 5 years, worldwide. It is estimated that of the 1.6 million worldwide childhood deaths attributed to diarrhea each year,27, 28 rotavirus accounts for 352,000\u2013595,000 cases; evidence also suggests that this is an underestimation.24, 29 Although it is generally thought of as a virus that affects children, rotavirus can affect adults as immunity wanes later in life. Rotaviruses and noroviruses have similar modes of transmission: both are passed person to person, with outbreaks occurring in close settings such as day care centers, long-term care facilities, schools, and within families. Norovirus can also be spread by contaminated food or water. The previous name of norovirus, \u201cwinter vomiting disease,\u201d is a graphic reminder of its seasonality and main symptoms, although in adults the principal presentation is diarrheal illness. Unlike rotavirus, which is believed to produce lasting immunity, norovirus is antigenically diverse and produces acquired immunity that is believed to be type specific. Therefore, previous norovirus infection does not necessarily prevent further illness in a subsequent season, when another variant emerges.30, 31 Other enteric viruses that are less prevalent include sapoviruses, coronaviruses, toroviruses, and enteroviruses.",

It is often associated with outbreaks caused by contaminated water sources (drinking sources, water parks, and swimming pools), foods, and with person-to-person spread.

However, subclinical asymptomatic carriers, which can make up 11% of the cases during an outbreak,58 have also been implicated as one reason for nosocomial spread. Hospitals in both the developed59, 60, 61 and developing world60, 61, 62 have reported outbreaks of rotavirus infection; many of these patients are asymptomatic while they are in the hospital and only develop symptoms after discharge. Although in resource-sufficient nations nosocomial infections are generally considered to be a nuisance and a cause of a prolonged hospital stay, in resource-limited nations they are a significant cause of mortality. For adults, noroviruses are most often implicated in community and hospital outbreaks of infectious diarrheal illness.

Intermediate-risk regions include the Caribbean nations, South Africa, Argentina, Chile, Eastern Europe, Russia, China, and Portugal.84 Additional risk factors include young age, length of stay, adventure travel, immunosuppression, genetic susceptibility,7 low gastric acidity,85, 86 and, surprisingly, staying in a 5-star hotel.78 An early study performed by Kozicki et al,87 in which travelers were counseled to \u201cboil it, cook it, peel it, or forget it,\u201d showed that despite these warnings, high-risk eating habits were common. A recent meta-analysis concluded that the incidence of diarrhea was similar in travelers who followed the old adage and those that engaged in riskier eating habits.88 The reasons for this are probably due to poor restaurant hygiene; one study showed that even though restaurants in Guadalajara, Mexico, cooked and served cooked foods hot, high levels of coliform bacteria could still be cultured from them.89 Cooking foods does not always kill pathogens, leading to recommendations that food should be steaming hot before it can be considered safe for consumption.90 These studies highlight the difficulties in preventing traveler's diarrhea; despite much research into risks and causes, little change as occurred in the frequency of travelers' diarrhea illnesses during the past 50 years.",

            "text": "Figure 1: Normal intestinal physiology and alteration by pathogens and their toxins. The average oral intake for an adult is 1.5 L fluid/day. Combined with salivary, gastric, biliary, and pancreatic secretions 7 L fluid enter the upper small bowel each day, most of which is absorbed by the time it reaches the distal small bowel. However, this small bowel fluid is mixed with a remarkable bidirectional flux of water and electrolytes in the upper small bowel that probably exceeds 50 L isotonic fluid each day, to aid in the absorption of digested dietary intake.4. This striking bidirectional electrolyte transport is driven by an active, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)\u2013dependent active sodium (Na) absorption pump located on the basolateral membranes of both intestinal crypt and villus tip cells (middle). Because the chloride (Cl\u2212) channel is located on the luminal surface of the crypt cells, this Na pump mediates secretion of Cl\u2212 (along with Na and water) from the crypts and neutral NaCl absorption in the differentiated villus tip cells. Thus, a relatively slight shift in this large bidirectional flux can readily overload the colonic absorptive capacity, which rarely exceeds 2\u20133 L/day. Like cholera toxin (CT), E coli heat-labile toxin (LT) opens Cl\u2212 channels, leading to secretory watery diarrhea or traveler's diarrhea. The E coli heat-stable toxin (ST) activates guanylate cyclase to increase intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, inhibiting NaCl absorption and leading to secretory diarrhea. Selective damage of absorptive villus tips, which occurs in viral, protozoal, and other villus-damaging or inflammatory processes, leaves unbalanced secretory crypts that are not offset by healthy villus tip absorption, also leading to watery diarrhea. Small bowel pathogens are presented in the right panels: those that produce secretory enterotoxins are in the red box, those that selectively disrupt absorptive villus tips are in the green box, and ileocolonic pathogens are in the tan box.",

            "text": "Figure 2: Diagnosis, treatment, and causes of diarrheal diseases. For patients with diarrheal illnesses, it is important to first adequately assess the patient and determine the level of dehydration (panel 1). Important factors include duration of illness; alertness, skin turgor, mucous membrane dryness, sunken eyes or fontanelles, and postural hypotension all indicate moderate or severe hypovolemia and dehydration; signs of inflammation include fever, bloody stool, and tenesmus. In cases of dehydration (panel 2), patients can be rehydrated by oral administration of fluids that contain glucose, sugar or starch, and electrolytes; and patients can be given bismuth subsalicylate or loperamide if their diarrhea is not bloody (panel 2). If patients are unconscious or vomiting, fluids should be replaced intravenously. Pediatric patients can be given an oral rehydration solution made of sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, potassium chloride, and glucose or glucose polymer (such as sucrose) in water. Or, table salt and sugar can be added to orange juice, and bananas can be added to provide potassium. There are a number of epidemiologic and clinical clues that can be used to identify the infectious agent (panel 3). Epidemiologic factors that should be considered include the food that patients have eaten (raw, undercooked meats, raw seafood), antibiotics taken (especially for C difficile infection), sexual practices (men who have sex with men might have proctitis or colitis with sexually transmitted pathogens), and recent travel (indicate bacterial pathogens such as enterotoxigenic E coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter; persistent diarrhea can be caused by protozoans such as Giardia or Cryptosporidium). Outbreaks of viral-related (norovirus or rotavirus) disease or those caused by organisms with relatively low-infectious inocula that are spread by fecal oral contact, such as Shigella, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium, are most commonly observed in day care settings. Other epidemiologic clues include immunoglobulin A deficiency, which predisposes to giardiasis, and immunosuppression (particularly in patients with AIDS), which can lead to protozoal infections, Mycobacterium avium complex, and intestinal cytomegalovirus infections. Clinical features can also be used to identify the infectious agent. Bloody diarrhea is associated with Shiga toxin-producing E coli, Shigella and E histolytica infections; abdominal pain with Yersinia and some C difficile infections; dysentery with Shigella or Campylobacter infection; wasting with Giardia or Cryptosporidium infection; and fecal inflammation with Shigella, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and some E coli and C difficile infections.",

            "text": "Figure 3: An algorithm for severe, bloody, inflammatory, or outbreak-related infectious diarrhea. In addition to the management of fluid and electrolyte imbalances, nonsecretory or outbreak-related diarrhea may need further workup for definitive causative diagnoses and pathogen-directed therapy. Depending on the epidemiologic setting involved and likely causes, specific diagnostic tests are suggested as discussed in the text. Specific bacteria such as Campylobacter, Shigella, or C difficile and protozoa such as Cryptosporidium, Giardia, or Cyclospora may require specific antibacterial or antiparasitic agents, respectively. Empiric antimicrobial therapy, while awaiting laboratory test results, is usually appropriate for these pathogens. However, antibacterial treatment may worsen diarrhea secondary to EHEC (eg, E coli 0157:H7), which usually presents with noninflammatory, bloody diarrhea.",
